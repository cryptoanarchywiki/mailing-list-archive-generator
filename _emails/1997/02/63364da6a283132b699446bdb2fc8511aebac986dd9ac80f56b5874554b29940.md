Deja-News now carries both alt.cypherpunks and alt.cypherpunks.announce.
There was never a problem with cypherpunks-announce. Whoever volunteered to
run the monthly meeting just emailed to Hugh, who posted the announcement.
I would suggest to avoid fixing what isn't broken and make
alt.cypherpunks.announce a moderated list with Hugh and Eric as the
moderators.

The cypherpunks* lists on toad.com could be set up as mail-to-news gateways
(I volunteer to do so if needed) and all current subscribers unsubscribed
after a suitable warning outlining ways of accessing USENET. If the list
owner should so desire, I volunteer to write the tutorial.
