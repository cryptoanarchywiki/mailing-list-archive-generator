HP in their first 17 years of making personal computers always sent
real engineers along with salespeople to their product rollouts.

Starting in late 1983 with their first MS-DOS computer, they did a
180-degree and eliminated the engineers, and started sending people
who knew nothing about HP products, which is bad in the sense that
some folks wanted to know "Why should I buy HP when I can get the
real thing, i.e. IBM"?  As a sales manager, I always had a hard time
with that one.  I blame HP in retrospect, for a moron mentality in
their marketing department.
