Cpunks,


A number of spam mails (I counted about 100 in my incoming mail) were 
sent to the list from my account last night.

I do not take particular precautions with my password for this 
account as there is no sensitive mail sent through it, I recall in 
particular giving the password to someone to test out a machine 
recently and I believe they may be the culprit. 

Again, my appologies for the inconvenience and you have to admit that 
while his method may have been less than subtle his message was 
certainly something we can all relate to ;-)
