I'm forwarding this from the commonlaw list because of the usage of the 
name, "cypherpunks."

>This morning near 3:00 a.m., somebody sent messages to ALL the Senate and
>House members, putting *MY* email name and address on them, and another set,
>putting *AL'S* email name and address on them, threatening to delete all the
>House and Senate files (whatever THAT means), saying:
>
>"All files on the Senate's computers will be deleted by our
>gang of cypherpunks dedicated to the eradication of your systems."
>
>[The one to the House members was the same, except the word "Senate" was
>"House."]
>
>Some of the messages had bad addresses, though, so they bounced to us, since
>whoever the real sender was had put our names as the "sender," which is how
>we found out about it.
>
>This looks like someone could be really intending to do something to the
>House/Senate computers and they are obviously trying to lay it at our feet.
>
>Is there legislation pending somewhere that somebody needed a so-called
>"terrorist threat" to get it passed ??!!
>
>I have a 1 meg file of the messages we got and the messages we sent out to
>our service provider and to the Secret Service I would appreciate if people
>would be willing to store for safe keeping.
>
>Can anyone make the file available for FTP?  We don't have an FTP site.
>
>We are definitely being set up.
