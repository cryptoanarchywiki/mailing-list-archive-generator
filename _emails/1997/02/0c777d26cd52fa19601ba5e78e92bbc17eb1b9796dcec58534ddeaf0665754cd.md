<sigh> it is you who were demonstrating your ineptitude by spewing
120+ line length postings.  Why is it so difficult for you to keep
under 80 chars?  Would you like some technical assistance?  Notice how
near every one else apart from yourself is managing to keep under 80
chars?  Does every one apart from yourself live in the `dark ages'?  I
suppose you write letters on A4 landscape mode too?

When I see a posting with such long lines I hit the `n' key.

(cpunks-flames material? :-)
