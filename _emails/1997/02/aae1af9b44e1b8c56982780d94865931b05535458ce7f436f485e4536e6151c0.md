Ironically, we (the good guys) are going to be the beneficiaries of an 
ignorant public, for a change!  We all know that difficulty is not linear 
with bit-size, but hearing that "40 bits is crackable in four hours!"  will 
be interpreted by non-technical people as a strong level of suspicion 
directed at DES as well.
