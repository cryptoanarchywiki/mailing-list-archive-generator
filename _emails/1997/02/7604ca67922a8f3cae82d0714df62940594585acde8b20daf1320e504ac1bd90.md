Mike sheds more heat than light on the issue. Gilmore does not always
represent the EFF; not every action of his is an EFF action.

As for the "rift," may observers said at the time that DT was a Jerry
Berman "appeasement and capitulation" scheme. Note Berman no longer works
at EFF. Note EFF is no lnoger in DC.

And yes, I've read Tim May's essay on his EFF membership. I probably would
have had the same reaction.
