Yeah.  I as a spam artist send the "proof" message through the e-cash
verification center with the Send To: field returning it to a mail exploder.
Each receipient gets the same dollar.
This assumes that the To: field is not hashed into the verification
signature, and that the verification works like a glorified remailer.  (cash
added on a separate channel).
