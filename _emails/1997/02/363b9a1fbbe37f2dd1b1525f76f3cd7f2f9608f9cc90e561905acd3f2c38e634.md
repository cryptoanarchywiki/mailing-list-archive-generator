   Here's the overview:
   cypherpunks@toad.com is going away. In its place is a distributed
   forum. This forum is currently made up of a network of mailing lists,
   which send all their messages to each other. In the future, the
   newsgroup alt.cypherpunks will be added to this network (posts to the
   newsgroup go to the mailing lists, mail to the lists goes to the
   newsgroup). The mailing lists will be faster than the newsgroup, the
   newsgroup will probably let you use better filtering tools. Your
   choice.

There is currently a newsgroup cypherpunks.list on taz.nceye.net
world-accessible.  It receives cypherpunks@algebra.com, but posts
there aren't sent back to the list yet.  Anyone who wants an NNTP feed
of it can have one.
