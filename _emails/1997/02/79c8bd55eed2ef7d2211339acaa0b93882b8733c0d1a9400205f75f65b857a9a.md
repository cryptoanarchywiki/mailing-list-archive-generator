I hope you misspelled "news server." alt.cypherpunks (and subgroups)
is a newsgroup.

You should join one of the distributed mailing lists (choose the list
admin you like/trust the most). There is supposed to be a gateway
between the mailing list and the newsgroup, but it is not up yet.

Here's the overview:
cypherpunks@toad.com is going away. In its place is a distributed
forum. This forum is currently made up of a network of mailing lists,
which send all their messages to each other. In the future, the
newsgroup alt.cypherpunks will be added to this network (posts to the
newsgroup go to the mailing lists, mail to the lists goes to the
newsgroup). The mailing lists will be faster than the newsgroup, the
newsgroup will probably let you use better filtering tools. Your
choice.

HTH,
Jer
