You want to think about how does someone attack the passphrase?

Essentially, there are dictionary methods, where probably passphrasess
are checked.  These are enhanced by the use of changers, where the
word is modified in ways common to people changing passwords:

target
Target
targeT
target0
0target
target1

Crack, by Alex Muffet, produces on the order of 1000 derived words per
word its given.

I use phrases of 30-90 pink elephants with some arbitrary pizzas tossed on
the floor.

| Bottom line, totally random ASCII will have lots of bits per

| to be," "This is my passphrase," etc.).
