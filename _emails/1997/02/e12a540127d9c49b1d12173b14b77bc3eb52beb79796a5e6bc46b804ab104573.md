recreational activities on the resort island of Anguilla.
Participants are encouraged to bring their families.


Workshop:

A 40-hour workshop, intended for anyone with commercial software
development experience who wants hands-on familiarity with the issues
and technology of financial cryptography, is planned in conjunction
with FC97, to be held during the week preceding the conference.

For more information on the workshop, please see the URL

Venue:

The InterIsland Hotel is a small 14-room guest house and a large,
comfortable 150 seat conference facility with additional space for a
small 10-booth exhibition.  The Inter-Island is on Road Bay, near
Sandy Ground Village, in the South Hill section of Anguilla.  The
conference, workshop, and exhibition will have TCP/IP internet access.
The rooms at the InterIsland itself have sold out, but there are many
other hotels and guest houses on Anguilla, and shuttle service to the
conference will be available.


Air Transportation and Hotels:

Air travel to Anguilla is typically done through either San Juan or
St. Thomas for US flights, or St. Maarten/Martin for flights from
Europe and the US.

Anguillan import duties are not imposed on hardware or software which
will leave the island again. There are no other taxes--or cryptography
import/export restrictions--on Anguilla.
