                Computer crimes rife,
                unreported 
                By Reuters
                February 13, 1997, 9:45 a.m. PT 

                WASHINGTON--Security experts say hackers
                are finding it easier to break into computer
                networks and steal money, partly because
                companies are reluctant to admit that they are
                vulnerable. 

                "If I want to steal money, a computer is a much
                better tool than a handgun," Daniel Geer, director of
                engineering for Open Market, told a House of
                Representatives technology subcommittee hearing on
                computer security. "


Has anyone been following this debate more closely?  Nothing in any 
of the articles I've seen on this story have mentioned the role of 
strong encryption.

<rhetorical question mode on>
Why can't banks better protect themselves?  Why can't banks better 
authenticate electronic transactions to prevent theft & break-ins?  
Why is the such a dearth of protective measures available to the 
institutions?

The public has a right to know!
<rhetorical question mode off>

Seriously, though, has anyone been following these hearings in more 
detail?
