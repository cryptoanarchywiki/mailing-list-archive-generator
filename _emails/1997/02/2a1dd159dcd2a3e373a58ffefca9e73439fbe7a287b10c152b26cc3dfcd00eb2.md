Nonsense. The signal had left long before the moderation began. The
steepest drop in signal (not S/N ratio) was between shortly before Perry
left and Vulis had completed his takeover. Signal is cause by signal
generators. Most top signal generators, other than Tim, had left because of
pollution caused by the likes of Vulis, aga, and his homophonic boyfriends.

Moderation has nothing to do with the loss of signal other than that signal
from Tim was lost. And while I appreciated Tim's essays, they were never
the sole source of signal on the list. Tim did not even provide the
majority of signal. "Best individual contributor", sure.
