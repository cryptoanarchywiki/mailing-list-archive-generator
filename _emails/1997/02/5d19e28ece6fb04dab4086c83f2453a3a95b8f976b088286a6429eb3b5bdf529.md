I just unsubscribed to cypherpunks, simoutaneously (excuse the spelling)
subscribing to the cypherpunks-unfiltered (and low tar) list.  One problem I
have is in transit, how many messages did I loose?  Since the moderated list
is delayed by however long it takes for Mr. Sandforth to read the messages,
I lost at least as many messages as he pulled in last minus the number of
messages that he had already sent out.  I thought about subscribing for
about four hours to both lists, but I have enough trouble with my account
hitting its maximum kB limit.  I don't have any filters, scripts, or other,
and yet I still had a problem, (one which I finally ignored).
