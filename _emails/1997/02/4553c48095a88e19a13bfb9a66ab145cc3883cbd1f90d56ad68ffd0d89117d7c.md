I didnt hear any rumor or anything. It just makes sense to me to be
paranoid like Mr. Zimmerman said.
Besides, my uncles friends write cryptagraphy for government guys
and big businesses and they mostly use 2.1 and 2.3 instead of the
stuff they write.

They say the code for the new stuff (PGP) is ok but there are too 
many funny-stuff programs being written that mess with it but that
nobody is bothering to write funny-stuff to mess with the old
versions. They say the same thing about their own stuff that they
are writing.

I cant read code real good, so i just listen to the best guys I know
to know how paraniod to be.

"No shit, Sherlock!"
Thats what we say on my lists when people say stuff that nobody 
should forget. I think a lot of the cypherpunks forgot the stuff
that they put at the end of their messages since they dont do it.

Thanks for writing me. Your polite and helpful.
