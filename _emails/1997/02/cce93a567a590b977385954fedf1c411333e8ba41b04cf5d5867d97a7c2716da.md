It is in place. It feeds from cypherpunks@algebra.com. Bryan Reece 
reece@taz.nceye.net runs the posting bot. taz.nceye.net is an open
newsserver offering several cypherpunks newsgroups.

I am not yet sure if taz is now a part of the mainstream usenet, that 
is, it may not be connected to the Big USENET.

Correct.

I will subscribe to it.

Now, it is important to realize that Lance's machine is probably much
better connected than mine. Once we get connected with him, you may be
better off reading cypherpunks from cypherpunks@cyberpass.net. If you
su-bsc-ribe to cypherpunks@algebra.com, it may take longer for articles
to reach you.

I still think that it is a good idea to do nothing for several days and
wait until the distributed network picks up cyberpass. Then, subscribe
to any node of your liking.
