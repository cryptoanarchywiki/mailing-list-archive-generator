Hi all,

I crossposted the first post to the usenet group to here but just to 
make sure you all get the message I have created alt.cypherpunks.

Even if it is only a temporary measure it will be a forum from which 
we can establish something better. 

Fuck you John, we should have done this a long time ago.
