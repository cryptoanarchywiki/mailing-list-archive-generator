That won't solve the problem. The list has become counterproductive. It is
impossible for other lists to provide a real forum for the discussion of
the topics that this list used to be about while CP still exists. At the
same time, CP has long stopped providing such a forum. CP is draining
energy from its subscribers and the cause. Kill it! Kill it now!
