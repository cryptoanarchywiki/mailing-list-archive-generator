I think that it is a great idea. If you want to contribute to the 
effort to keep the list, this is great. You could join the network of
other cypherpunks mailing lists. 

There is a small list for discussing these networking issues,
cypherpunks-hosts@algebra.com. It is not for crypto-discussions per 
se, but rather for discussing how we proceed with these lists.

You can subscribe to it through majordomo@algebra.com.
