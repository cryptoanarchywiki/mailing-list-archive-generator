	This is where I often get a little confused.

	Correct me if I am wrong, but it was my understanding that the
constitutuion was _not_ a document that explicitly spelled out what writes 
_I_ had, but rather spelled out fairly precisely what the _government_ was 
allowed to do.

	In otherwords, the Constitution does not restrict _me_ rather it 
restricts the _feds_ (and the Feds alone).

	My rights are WHATEVER ISN'T IN THE CONSTITUTION, and the government
can only, ONLY do what the constitution says it can.

	???
