Sorry, I was just going by what I saw in your e-mail address. My point was
not really about Tivoli, or IBM, or any other particular company, though.

I was making the point that _any_ site distributing a list is likely to
face legal pressures not to carry certain items. Read between the lines (or
read the unedited list) the discussion by John Gilmore, Sandy Sandfort, and
the products of Sandy's company, and legal pressures applied, to see what I
mean.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
