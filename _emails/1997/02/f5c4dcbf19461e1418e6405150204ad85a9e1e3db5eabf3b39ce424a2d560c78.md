Kanter has sent mail like this on a first message.  I friend of mine who
writes for a local computer magazine (Computer Bits) wrote to Solid Oak with
a critical letter and got the same treatment.  Nothing addressing any of the
criticisms about the software or the company, just a nasty-gram to him and
his postmaster.
