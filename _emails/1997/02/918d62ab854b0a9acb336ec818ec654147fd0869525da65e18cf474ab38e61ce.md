Wine and cheese are the key.  You hit that one on the head.  I tried
those Mensa parties in Beverly Hills a few times, but the girls want
you to kiss their hands like some kinda princesses or something,

going.  Maybe this has something to do with why there are no c-punks
meetings in the L.A. area.
