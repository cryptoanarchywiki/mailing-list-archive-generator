  Well EFF itself is a lie--the were very well exposed by Wired Mag. a
while back as being nothing more than a corporate whore.  They represent
the interests of owners not consumers--the ACLU has been very open
in their critisism of the EFF in this regard.  A large corporation
waves some money in front of their noses and tells them to bend
over you can be sure they'll bend over.  Respectable free speech
advocates do not associate with EFF.

  Is Mr. Gilmore making this claim?

  And you could merely post this mailing list publically in the
alt group of your choice--I find it interesting at times but not
worth responding to in general since freedom of expressiion is
not a given.
