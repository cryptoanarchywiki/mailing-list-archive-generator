Depends how paranoid you are, how  good your passphrase is, how much you
trust the repairman not to snoop, etc.

For the hell of it I'd revoke my key and issue a new one though. It's
not a minor inconvenience, and when people use your old key you can still
decrypt the message... just send 'em a note that you prefer they use you're
current (unrevoked) key.
