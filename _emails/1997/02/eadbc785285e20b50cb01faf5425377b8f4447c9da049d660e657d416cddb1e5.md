	Umm... because you'll eventually accumulate _lots_ of addresses
that don't work, which will slow things down tremendously in sending
mail out?

	Well, loki@cyberpass.net has made the offer to host the entire
list... and Lance is certainly making money at it. While this would have
some problems in comparison with the distributed list idea (namely more of
a choke point), it would decidedly help.
