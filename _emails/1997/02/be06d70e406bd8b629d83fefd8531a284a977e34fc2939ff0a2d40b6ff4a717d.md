I agree.  But there is more.  As much as anything else, I didn't
change lists because of inertia and laziness.  I suspect that most 
people are like me in this regard.  I suspect that if the tactic had 
been to require people to subscribe to the moderated list we would 
see just the reverse of the current numbers.  In fact, in the 
interests of fairness, integrity, and adherence to the scientific 
method, I suggest that after this month trial has passed that we 
reverse the lists, and see how many change to the moderated list.

Absolutely no doubt that there is a conflict of interest.  In Sandy's shoes 
a saint couldn't be objective.
