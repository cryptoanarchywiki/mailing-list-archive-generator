I attended this presentation. Basically, what they do is to add
two packets to the "channel setup process", one that depends only
on the coorespondents, the other that contains the information
about this particular session.

A problem with this, as I pointed out to the presenters, is
that the first packet can be trivially used for traffic analysis.
The eavesdropper may not be able to determine who is
cooresponding, but they can tell if it is the same people
as in a previous conversation.

As you can see, IBM suggests cacheing the contents of the
first packet, so that you don't have to recalculate it each
time. Imagine how easy traffic analysis would be if the
identification packets were identical instead of just related.
