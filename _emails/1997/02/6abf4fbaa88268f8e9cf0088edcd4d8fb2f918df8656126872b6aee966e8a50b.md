    I was in attendance at an ISSA conference earlier this year where Mr. 
Murray gave the "keynote" speech on Electronic Commerce.  While he did 
strongly advocate the adoption of strong crypto and various methods of 
security, he never stepped into the more radical mode of encouraging 
people to break the law.  That was a different audience though.

    As he is also an ex-25 year IBM veteran it amazes me that he would 
make such a public outcry against govt. regulations (okay, so it's a 
stereotype).  Deloitte & Touche must really have a big stake in the 
pro-crypto market or else he actually cares a lot.
