This has a number of frige benifits, too. It's lower down in the
alphabetical list, so luser AOL-type people and auto-spam bots are
less likely to reach alt.p* or alt.s* than alt.c*. Also, it seperates
it from alt.cyberpunk and associated groups, thus maybe minimizing
innappropriate x-posts.

The hybrid mailing list/newsgroup system seems to me to be an
excellent setup. It is resilliant to the moderation woes that a
mailing list is vulernable to, and is also resistant to ISPs who don't
carry alt groups. It also provides a set of mail-news gateways for
people who wish to post anonymously to the newsgroup, whaile at the
same time being resistant to commercial spam abuse (why use a
mail-news to spam if it just goes to 1 newsgroup?).

Finally, a newsgroup makes it easy to spread the gospel to the
unwashed masses. Tim May's rants/essays would probably make excellent
usenet memes, and having more usenet people crypto-aware can only help
advance the causes of liberty and privacy. I hereby volunteer to do my
best to handle all the newbie questions.
