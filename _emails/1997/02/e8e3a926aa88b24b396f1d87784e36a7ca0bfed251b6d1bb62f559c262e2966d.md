For what it's worth, I wrote a very short fingerd that fetches _only_
a user's .pgpplan file, should it exist. Else it just exits. Someone
may have already done this, so be it. This was mostly for my own use,
but if anyone wants the code, feel free to use it. It's available from
my home page ( http://www.veriweb.com/people/jeremey/ ).

After calling getpwnam() on the username supplied, it calls setuid() with
the uid of the user being fingered. It ignores any finger options and
attempts to parse them out. It's possible I missed some. After setuid(),
it attempts to open a file called .pgpplan in the directory (pw_dir)
returned by getpwnam(). If this is not a _regular_ file, it exits, i.e.
no symlinks. Then it shoves the file out over stdout (this assumes it
was invoked by inetd). That's it.

I've only compiled it on Linux and BSDI, but it doesn't do anything very
odd, so it should compile fine on other Unix platforms.
