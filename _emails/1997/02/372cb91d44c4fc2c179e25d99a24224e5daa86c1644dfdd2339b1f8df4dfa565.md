This is a typical case of overconfidence on her part.

If she thought about it for longer, she would realize that she cannot
benchmark her gay-spotting performance very well.

If you presented her with, say, 100 unknown men and 50 of them were gays
and she'd identify everyone correctly, I would be impressed.

A truly great and simple book that talks about this stuff is ``Decision
Traps: the ten barriers to brilliant decision making''.
