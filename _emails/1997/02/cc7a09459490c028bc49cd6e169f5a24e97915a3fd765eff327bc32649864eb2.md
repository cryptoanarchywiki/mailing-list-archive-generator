The mailing list was ready yesterday. Currently I have about a dozen
subscribers who are testing it. Igor has his list up and I expect that we
will begin the cross-subscription process on Saturday or Sunday. I sent
a 'who is here' message to cypherpunks-hosts@algebra.com and have not
received any replies.

Thanks, I'll factor that into my equation. I, however won't be acting as
a mail-to-news gateway at this point. What I would like to see would be
a news site which sent a copy of each incoming message to a mailing list
and would have an email address where each new submission to the mailing
list would get sent to. To make it really interesting would be to use
two seperate remailers, one for each traffic path. Had you thought of
taking your news that far?
