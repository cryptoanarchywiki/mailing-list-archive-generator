Because PGP's user interface is yucky and its programmer
interface is even worse.


Amazing how people don't realize how much certain important 
things depend on such a (deceptively) simple concept as having
a nice user interface and a nice programmer interface.  In 
contradiction of certain cypherpunk urban legends, I suspect
that such pedestrian details are far, far more important to 
the course of history than the clumsy and feckless 
machinations of government agencies.


But for the good news, see the quote from Jim Bidzos in my
".plan".
