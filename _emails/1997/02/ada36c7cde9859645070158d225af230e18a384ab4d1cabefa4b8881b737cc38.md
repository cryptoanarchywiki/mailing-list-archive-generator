What [I believe] is being referred to is an incident where someone
seriously messed up the formatting on a message sent through a
remailer to the point where it ended up in a mailbox on the system as
opposed to the intended destination, at which point the operator of
the remailer (I can't recall off the top of my head who) reported to
remailer-operators@c2.net that xyz@foo.bar was trying to send some
type of image file to someone@some.where...  Not at all monitoring the
messages going through the remailer, just reporting something that was
so F.U.B.A.R. that the software couldn't figure out what was supposed
to happen.
