But if someone leans on my doorbell for 4 hours solid, I can call the 
police and have them carted away.  Carried to extremes, it's criminal 
trespass.

And, just as in the case with my doorbell, when the undesirable

things with real world consequences are arbitrary, unlike libertarian 
fantasies, which enjoy the luxury of unreality.
