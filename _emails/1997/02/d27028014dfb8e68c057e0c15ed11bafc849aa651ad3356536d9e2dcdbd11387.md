I run an anonymous remailer. I have a mixmaster type at mix@wazoo.com nd a
cypherpunk type at remailer@wazoo.com. Also, there is a WWW interface at
http://www.wazoo.com/~remailer.
I know that my system doesn't keep any recorders except number of messages
that go through. I am a "secure remailer". Before I set up the remailer, I
did a lot of soul searching, knowing that somewhere along the road I could
help a "baby raper" or something else I find morally objectionable. I came to
the conclusion, and I still think it is the right conclusion, that the public
service offered by an anonymous remailer far outweighs the disadvantages of
potentially helping someone I personally find objectionable.
Setting up a remailer, for someone that is already running a domain, is easy
enough to be almost trivial. With the explosion of domains the internet has
seen in the past couple of years, at least some of the remailers have to be
honest and not fronts for the DOJ, FBI, and whatever other alphabet
orginizations...
Obviously, you are thinking that any FBI agent that wanted to could post
this exact message, and YOU ARE RIGHT!
Take advantage of a string of remailers. Use proper encryption, so that none
of them know more than the next hop. Make sure you vary the order of
remailers you go through with each message. 
Being cautious, you can be almost 100% certain your message is anonymous.
