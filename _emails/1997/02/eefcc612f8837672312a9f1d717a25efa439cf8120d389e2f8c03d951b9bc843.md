	I got this message (on a system that I am webmaster on) regarding
something that sounded so stupid it made me chuckle...Naughty Robot...I
have enclosed the message below.  If any of you have any idea what this
user is talking about, any info would be appreciated.

	Personally it sounds like another "GoodTimes Virus" again...
