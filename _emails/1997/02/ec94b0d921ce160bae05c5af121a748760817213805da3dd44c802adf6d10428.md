I received a nice flyer in the mail the other day from "Chip Express"
(www.chipexpress.com, 800-95-CHIPX). They are offering Laser
Programmed Gate Arrays.  It appears to be a reasonable way to get some
Wiener chips built.  As I recall, the Wiener design required about
23,000 gates.  Their blurb had the following table in in:

  FPGA Gates  ASIC Gates  500 Units  1000 Units  5000 Units
    40,000      20,000      $77        $45         $10
   Not Avail   200,000     $176       $150         $82

So it appears that you can get 5000 Wiener key search chips build for
about $50K.  I'm not sure about the speed, but I wouldn't be surprised
if you could clock these at 50 MHz.  The Wiener design is pipelined
and searches one key per clock, so each chip could search 50e6 keys /
second.  50e6 * 5000 = 250e9 keys / second for $50K

Happy Hunting...
