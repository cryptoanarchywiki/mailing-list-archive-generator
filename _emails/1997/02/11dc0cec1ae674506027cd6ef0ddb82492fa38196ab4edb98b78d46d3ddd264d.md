Hm...

In the year 1513 or 1514 someone who could be an Honourable 
Member of this list (if one could be one...) wrote:

Please stop at looking too much on how people scream about
your new ideas and continue this list the way you like
it!!!


I think it's Your Machine and we have to respect your
decision to pull the plug, nobody should blame you for
that, but please listen a little to the 1000+ people who
don't scream and are obviously happy with the list and
respected your right to do the "sandy filter experiment".
