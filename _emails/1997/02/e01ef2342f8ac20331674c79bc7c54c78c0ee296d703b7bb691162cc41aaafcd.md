	Umm... IIRC, the only person who's announced how he's filtering
for duplicates is Igor, and he's just checking for messageIDs. Won't
those get chunked on going through a mail2news gateway, and thus
possibly come back through a news2mail gateway? The filtering
mechanism could be improved via MD5 digests, etcetera (someone's
already given a recipe for such; thank you), but even so various
mungings could still set up a mailing loop. (Yes, I'm paranoid
about those; I may have been reading list-managers for too long and
seen too many stories on there.) The sensible place to keep
track of possible duplicates is at the gateway; it can
certainly filter based on that it (or, for that matter, another
known bidirectional gateway) sent a message out.

>newsgroup seems wrong for noise (both to the list itself and to

	Delay reasons being that mail will go to Usenet, go
all over the place there, and then get replied to later than if
it were just on the mailing list(s)? A potential problem, yes.
But (especially given the options I mentioned below), this
would appear to be a matter for individual users to decide
by which list they go with and any added control headers.
Maximum individual sovreignty (sp?).

	That would probably depend on: A. if any other circumstances
other than deliberately sabotaging your message's translation would
also disrupt its chances of getting through seriously, particularly
if they weren't something you'd spot; and B. if sufficiently bad
messages would disrupt INN's operations too much. You'd know a lot
more than I would in regard to the latter, and probably the former.
I was last a serious participant on USENET on a Vax running VMS
(via Bitnet, as a matter of fact... a while back).
