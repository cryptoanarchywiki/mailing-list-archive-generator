       1-800-688-6115 press 0 or just wait for the operator. My second
order consisting of posters and video has not arrived either. It has been
about 6 weeks. The Rainbow order was only 2 weeks. Be prepared that when
you order the Rainbow series you will be getting a large box.Their are
something like 30+ booklets in the series.
        There is a set of security posters  that include a Santa
poster.And there is also a video with two films on it (Acess Ins and outs
adb Acess Control).
                    Good luck on your mission Mr. Phelps,
                         moroni
