Cauzin was bought by Eastman Kodak shortly after they started
advertising in the big rags (like _Byte_, which printed a test strip a
month or so before Cauzin made their big advertising push).  Cauzin was
even putting freeware programs in their ads.  At that time, Kodak was
just entering the soon-to-be-lucrative magnetic media market with their
floppy disk line.  I'd say they were bought and buried.
