Yet another person who needs a good stern talking to by the nearest
cypherpunk --- this guy posted to comp.lang.perl.misc with the following
blasphemy, which I luaghed at until I had tears in my eyes.
--BEGIN COMPLETE STUPIDITY--
I want to make it executable to protect the source code from being read. I
don't want the source code available because I don't want people looking
for security holes.
--END COMPLETE STUPIDITY--

If anyone wants to spam this guy, or at least show him the error of his
ways, his sig explains the necessary info:

If the ionization rate is constant for all ectoplasmic entities, we could
really bust some heads! In a spiritual sense, of course.
