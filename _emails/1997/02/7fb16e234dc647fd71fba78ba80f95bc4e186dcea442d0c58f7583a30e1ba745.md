On the Ft. Meade addresses for two of the cpunk domains, was there
not a humorous explanation for this posted a couple of years back? 

Dimly remembered: there's a town of Ft. Meade as well as The Mad Fort
itself, or something like that, and that a mail drop would be handy for
swapping useless bits of bs-buffer overflow.

If this is now classified, hit D, Degausse and deodorize your Farradage!
