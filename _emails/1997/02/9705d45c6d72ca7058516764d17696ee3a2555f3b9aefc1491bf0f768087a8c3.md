Use the setsa program provided in the utils directory. Something along
the lines of

	setsa esp 3des-md5 i key 
should do the trick. It was really a choice between distributing the code and 
lingering on it for a few more days until the docs were better, and I chose
the first. Bsides, the source *is* the ultimate documentation :-)
