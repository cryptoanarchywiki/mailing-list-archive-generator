There is no policy at this point. We have not even agreed to a means to
institute the network or its basic architecture. The only point of mandatory
agreement is between any two individual list operators and the mechanism
they use to transfer between those two nodes.

This sort of policy distribution won't work, as to reasonable I think not.
If everyone does their own thing with no compromise then nothing will
get done.

There are no explicit rules at this point. Yes there can be all sorts of 
rules, both implicit (eg copyrights) and explicit. Anyone can write rules.
Nobody must agree to anything other than implicit agreements, course
the concept of 'agreement' sorta goes out the window with implicits.

Don't see how anyone can force the remailer to do anything.

Can't speak for anyone else but can say with some degree of certainty that
no participant in cpunks can stop me from subscribing whoever I want. There
is certainly no mechanism envisioned to authenticate subscriptions with
the remailer operators.
