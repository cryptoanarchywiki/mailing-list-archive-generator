Phill, in this example, is not my friend, but a lender.

Mmm, likely the result will be that Toto will be impoverished (it is an
example, do not take it personally) and will not only not be able to
murder me, but also will be too afraid to sue me (because I would
rather pay for a cheaper assassination than to pay damages).

Why, I will have a lot of money.

This is a wrong Mafia rule, they do kill debtors who are in default.

When ten people make deals with each other, it becomes hard to
triangulate. And it is easy, if you know what deals are done, to change
the result of triangulation: suppose that I know that you borrowed 1
million from Toto, that my _and_ yours business partner had been
murdered (by me, but no one knows), and I am afraid that someone will
triangulate me and implicate me in that murder. I secretly order
the AP bot to kill Toto, and you get implicated.

Not good.
