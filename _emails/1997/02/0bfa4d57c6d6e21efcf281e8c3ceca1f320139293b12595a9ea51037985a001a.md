If I understood the last several hundred messages correctly, they have
tried to make the point that the cypherpunks mailing list (unedited)
was more ideal than a newsgroup.  If this is what Dave is offering,
I'm surprised if more people don't jump on it.  Then again, they
took their good ol' time jumping onto cypherpunks-unedited.
