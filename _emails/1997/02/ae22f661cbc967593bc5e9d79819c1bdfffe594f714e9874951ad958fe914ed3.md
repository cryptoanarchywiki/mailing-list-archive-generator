   Cylink (CYLK) announced today that the government has approved export of
   the company's security products containing strong encryption.

   Likewise, Digital Equipment (DEC) has also won approval and plans to
   begin shipments of encryption-enabled networking and system software
   immediately.

   A third company, Trusted Information Systems, effectively had approval
   before January 1 because of its existing key recovery technology.
