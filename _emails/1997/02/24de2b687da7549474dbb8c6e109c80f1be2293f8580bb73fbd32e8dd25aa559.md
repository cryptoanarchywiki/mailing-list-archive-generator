I'd sure like to know how they figure out what "society" really wants to do! 
 In April of 1993, which the original Clipper chip/system was proposed, not 
all that many people had even heard of the Internet, and far fewer were 
aware of the details of encryption.  Surely they didn't mean to suggest that 
"society" was in favor of Clipper?  Blissfully ignorant, perhaps, but not in 
favor!  (B^)

Obviously, with their "If you only knew what we know" they'll claim that the 
public would have favored Clipper if it knew the real problems, but the way 
I see it, if they REALLY believed that there was a serious threat to 
anything other than merely their jobs, they would have done a better job 
convincing the public.
