        9.What is the status of the Macintosh product?

           ViaCrypt PGP 2.7.1 is available for the Macintosh today. We are
working on a new
           version for the Macintosh, adding new features and revising the
graphical user
           interface to make it easier to use. The revised Macintosh
version will follow the
           Windows release.
