I've been testing Pretty Safe Mail on 68k and PPC platforms, and I
completely agree with you for the 68040 slowness.

But on a Powermac 7600 (604/120Mhz), it took less than 3 seconds to sign
the same document. Highware claims that a faster 68k is in the works.

They've offereed to have PSM externally audited, but I haven't heard of
any volunteers.
