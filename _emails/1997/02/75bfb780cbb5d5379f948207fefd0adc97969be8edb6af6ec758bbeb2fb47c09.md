Tim C. Mayonnaise sits at his terminal dressed in 
five-inch stiletto heels, fishnet stockings, a 
gold-lame mini-skirt, a purple halter with girdle 
underneath to keep in his flabby gut, a Fredericks of 
Hollywood padded bra also underneath the halter, a 
cheap Naomi Sims pink afro wig, waiting to yank his 
crank whenever a black man responds to one of his inane 
rants.
