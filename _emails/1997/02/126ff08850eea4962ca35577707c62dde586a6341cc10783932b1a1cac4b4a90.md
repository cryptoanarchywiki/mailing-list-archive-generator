Just to add my $.02 to the me too pile:
It should be noted that the subscription from netbb+internet.
cypherpunks@andrew.cmu.edu is a mail<->news gateway for Carnegie
Mellon University people. It represents maybe 10-50 cypherpunks
readers. I used to read cypherpunks from there, but I see some kind
soul has subscribed CMU to the unedited list, so I will read that
instead. My killfile is just enough censorship for me.

On the choke points note, mailing lists are better than usenet because
legendary AOLers with there 5 free hours of fame and their ilk usually
don't figure out how to pester mailing lists. Being on a mailing list
usually requires a commitment, that is enough of a barrier for many of
the usenet underirables.

Waiting for the end of moderation,
Jer
