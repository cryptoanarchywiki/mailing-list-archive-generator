A while back, I experimented with a technique for adding an md5 based
message-id at the top of my procmailrc.  Never got it working.  I'll
give it another shot middle of March, when I get back from FC '97*,
and catch up on stuff.

Someone could of course, beat me to it.

The flow was:

all messages get piped into md5, then use formail to set a new header.
