The Mining Co. (http://www.miningco.com) is looking
for "siteguides".

There will surely be a guide needed for cryptography.

Pay is commensurate with hit volume, but it isn't too shabby,
at about 3K per month after about a year.

There is the original posting from Sideman's Online Insider following
this post to acquaint you with the particulars.

Good Luck to whomever from this list (for I'm sure someone will) 
takes the aformentioned position. I would, but I'm applying for a 
different site in the Culture/Beliefs section.

On one other note, the PGP Plugin for Eudora is MARVELOUS!
THIS I can even teach a clueless newbie!

For more info, check out < http://www.miningco.com >, sometime on Monday,
they will make a lot more information available there than the "coming
soon" that was there as of this writing.
