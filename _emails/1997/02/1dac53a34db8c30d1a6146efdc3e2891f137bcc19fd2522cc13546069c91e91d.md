ZDNET ANNOUNCEMENT          2/24/97
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you like to play games? No, not those kinds of games! You know, PC or
video games. If the answer is absolutely, sometimes or even just maybe,
then you'll want to check out GameSpot and VideoGameSpot. These are the
hottest, and most fun sites on the Web for information about PC and video
games, bar none! (They are so good, they are now serving as the Games
Channel on ZDNet!)

GameSpot (www.gamespot.com) gives you the most up-to-date reviews, demos,
news, in-depth features, strategy guides, previews, hints and cheats on
all of the latest PC games and hardware. They cover everything from the
most hyper action games to the more sedate, but mind-wrenching puzzle
games, and give you what you need both before you buy a game and after you
bring it home. No one else's online coverage of the PC game industry even
comes close.

VideoGameSpot (www.videogamespot.com) provides this same information, but
about video games played on the Sega Saturn, Sony Playstation and
Nintendo64 consoles. Of course you can't download a demo of a video game,
so they provide custom quick-time movies to give you a tantalizing taste
of each title.

Both sites encourage readers to submit their own reviews of games. Think
their review stinks? Submit your own and show the world that you're the
real expert!

And if winning free games or hardware has appeal (not unlike a lemon),
then point old man browser over to these sites, PRONTO!! GameSpot and
VideoGameSpot give away thousands of dollars in prizes every month (almost
$40,000 in February). The contests are simple and fun, and there are
hundreds of winners who could tell you how easy it is to get a free game
in the mail. (Winner! Winner! Chicken Dinner!!)

To visit the sites, go to the URL's listed below, or link to them from the
ZDNet Games channel (www.zdnet.com/games). See you soon at GameSpot and
VideoGameSpot!
