	I would suggest that the cure for this problem is to have what is
examined be a cryptographically secure hash instead of (or as well as)
the message ID. The hash should be over the body of the message, and possibly
the sender and Subject line.
	Unless Lance has driven up the prices at Infonex a lot, I'd be willing
to support such a server on an Infonex account. I'd _greatly_ appreciate help
getting the thing started, preferably as a group endeavour (to spread the
load (i.e., keep infonex from being overwhelmed), keep me from temptation,
and make it less likely that a legally troublesome message would go through
an account that I might be blamed for).
	-Allen
