Igor,

A friend, who, in the CP tradition requested to remain anonymous, and I were
doing an informal analysis of those subjects/topics which over the past year
generated the most discussion and, by implication, interest on the CP list.
Since the list at that time was reportedly unmoderated, we felt some weight
should be given to members' interests/desires as measured by their posts,
regardless of the applicability to the list topic.

With the exceptions of AP (oh so clearly way off-topic), list censorship (too
tedious),  and remarks either questioning or affirming the
sexuality/virility/femininity (or lack thereof ) of almost every CP
subscriber, the topic which claimed the most bandwidth was Ebonics. It seemed
to touch on several layers of CP interest: freedom of speech, obfuscation,
tolerance, intolerance, phonetics, linguistics, race warfare,  etc. You name
it; just about every well-known c'punk jumped in to make some urbane
statement on this, sadly, now dead and  ignored issue. Nevertheless, the
bandwidth was there!  

Note; any messages followed by Punctuation Art were excluded if they seemed
to lack "dignity," for want of a better word.

Based on the above stats (available from my friend on request), my anonymous
friend and I request that you add Ebonics as an area of interest to
Cypherpunks in your List Intro.

Please judge this request on its merit and not on what you may think of me or
my anonymous (asexual) friend personally, thereby, by that very action,
initiating a New Order of Cypherpunks!

Thanks for you consideration.

More importantly, thank you for helping to keep this vibrant list alive.

Alec (and friend)
