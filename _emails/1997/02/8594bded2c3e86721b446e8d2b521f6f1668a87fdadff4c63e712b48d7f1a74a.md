    These chips look *very* promising.  Who needs Clipper, or HP's
    Clipper-under-another-name, when you can get triple DES from
    the free world at prices like this?

The critical thing is to get the horse out of
the barn before the door is barred.  Each and
every one of these sorts of vendors has to establish
use and distribution on a wide basis before governments
of any stripe start locking down on domestic use.  There
is little time and, yes, I am a paranoid who hopes thereby
to survive.
