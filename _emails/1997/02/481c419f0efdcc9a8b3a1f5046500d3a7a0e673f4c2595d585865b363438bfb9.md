Normally I'd address just the list, but in this case I'm sure you'll
understand.  Check the archives of Sandy's moderation announcements,
and I believe you'll see where he claimed that although *all* messages
would make it to the -unedited list, he admitted that some of those
would not make it to either the -edited or -flames lists, due to the
anomalies of hand-editing.
