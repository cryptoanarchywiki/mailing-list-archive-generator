Absolutely, It is really, as far as I see it anyway, just a stop-gap 
measure. The caballers haven`t got enough room to do their censorship 
on the 18000 or so big 7 groups so they decide to fuck up the alt. 
heirachy as well ;-)

Hopefully Igor and co.`s network of Majordomo's should be fully 
operational soon (as I understand it two are up and a third is on 
it's way) then we can move back there. Might even get it finished 
before the 20th?????
