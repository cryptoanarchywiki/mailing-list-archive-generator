- no "unsuscribe" and "unscrive" messages! (It makes it easy for
newcomers
to discover the group, read it for a while, then stop. It also, of
course,
increases the number of "What is crypto?" sorts of messages.)
........................................

In regards to the newbie questions, it occurred to me that it would be
useful to have a FAQ, much shorter than the Cyphernomicon, which would
get some basic questions answered and contain many collected references
& web sites for all the other questions which typically have come up on
the list and would certainly show up in a newsgroup.

Maybe LD could be prevailed upon to write it (he's probably not occupied
doing anything useful, anyway).... :>)
