Life is too complicated, ya' know?  I just wanna know who is this
PATTI SHOCK <shock@nevada.edu>  person, who's allegedly calling for
a moderation of some forum on Usenet.  The way I see it, if she's a
real babe, somebody should fix her up with some censored material
just to keep her happy.  Then just let some really mean, dirty
material through once a month or so, just so she knows the process
is working, and protecting her from all sorts of hideous stuff.

OTOH, if she's a Chelsea Clinton look-alike, why bother?
