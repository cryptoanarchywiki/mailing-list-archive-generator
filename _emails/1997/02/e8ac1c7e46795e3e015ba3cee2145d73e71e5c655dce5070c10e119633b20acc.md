Everybody relax, take a deep breath, and calm down a bit.  Paranoia seems
epidemic on the list these days.

I removed your address from the mailing list because it was producing
a bounce message for every message to cypherpunks.  I regularly 
remove addresses when this occurs; the alternative is to receive
thousands of bounce messages each day from non-working addresses.
I'll append the set of addresses that I removed on the same day
as you, for your edification.

I'll also enclose one of the bounces.

If you fix your mail so it doesn't bounce, you are welcome to
re-subscribe.
