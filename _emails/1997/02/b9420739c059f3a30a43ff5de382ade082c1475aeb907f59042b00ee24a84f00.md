At various stages in the transition, we will be getting multiple copies of
the same messages as the are re- cross- whatever-posted to lists,
newsgroups and anything else handy.

Anyone have a procmail script that will show me just ONE copy of messages,
even if the headers are not identical (e.g. one looped, another was
forwarded, etc.)?

I have yet to find a good guide to procmail coding. My file is long, and
inefficient, and a pain to maintain...and I'm too busy to learn it right.
