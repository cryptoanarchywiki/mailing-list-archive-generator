-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

    Virtually all list postings to the cypherpunks main list are 
    doubled; the first, which is a standard pass through with the 
    message ID of the sender, the second with the message ID of 
    toad.com.

    Obviously, the first is destined for the unedited list --which did 
    _not_ receive the message. The second has been re-IDd, which I 
    presume is your censorhip mark.

    I happen to subscribe to all three lists, even though
        
        main + flames == unedited

    is supposedly the intention, it is not. In order to divide the
    output stream from toad.com, sorting on "Sender: " is the only
    reasonable differentation (when toad's filters are working):

        Sender: owner-cypherpunks@toad.com
        Sender: owner-cypherpunks-flames@toad.com
        Sender: owner-cypherpunks-unedited@toad.com
        Sender: owner-coderpunks@toad.com

    in the case cited below, the only differentation between the 
    destinations is that the censored message has a "Message-ID: "
    from toad.com, while the one intended for unedited has a 
    "Message-ID: " not from toad.com.  was either of these 
    destinated from flames? --the main list with duplicated messages
    has contained any number of messages, including ones from the
    ASCII art series which should have gone to flames.

    so, why is the pass through message not being reliably re-headered 
    at toad.com to mark "Sender: owner-cypherpunks-unedited@toad.com"
    --but if it is, why is unedited receiving a duplicate --obviously
    the duplicate should have gone to flames. 

    BOTTOM LINE: your software is inadequate.  my neighbors' kids write 
    better filters than you have installed.
