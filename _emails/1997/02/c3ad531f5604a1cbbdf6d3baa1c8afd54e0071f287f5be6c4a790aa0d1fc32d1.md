Anyone seen this here?  I wasn't sure if it had been posted, so I thought
I'd pass it on.  I have not looked at the software yet...

Soft Winter Corporation, February 10, 1997 released:
Shade - strong encryption software for Windows NT.

Shade allows you to create encrypted disk device inside a file.
Such a device can then be formatted using any file system
(like NTFS or FAT) and used as a regular disk. The only difference
is that Shade will encrypt the data on every write operation
and decrypt it on every read operation.
