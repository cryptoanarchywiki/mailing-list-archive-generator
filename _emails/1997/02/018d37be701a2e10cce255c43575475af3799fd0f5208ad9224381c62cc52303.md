I newsgrouped several sub groups along with alt.cypherpunks.

alt.cypherpunks.announce
alt.cypherpunks.social
alt.cypherpunks.technical

but they do not appear to have taken effect (my local news server 
refuses to see them). Can anyone else see them? - If not I`ll have a 
word with my newsadmin.
