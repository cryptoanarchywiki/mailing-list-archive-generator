Thanks for forwarding the USACM analysis. We've put it at:

   http://jya.com/usacm.htm

We'd welcome those submitted by cypherpunks or others, for 
putting on jya.com.

It will be some time before BXA publishes them along with the
Final Rule, and, there's worldwide interest in the US's 
foot-shooting.
