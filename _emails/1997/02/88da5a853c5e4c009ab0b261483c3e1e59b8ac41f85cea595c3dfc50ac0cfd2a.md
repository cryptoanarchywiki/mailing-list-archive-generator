This is probably not an original idea, but...

Here's a potential use for E-cash: a server that doles out Java 
apps to clients; the clients run the apps, calculating whatever 
results are needed, and uploads the results in return for E-cash
(perhaps a zero-knowledge proof that the result is accurate? another 
is to use only a trusted pool of registered and accountable users rather
than anonymous clients).

The server admins would be paid by those who need computations,
keeping a percentage and using the rest to be offered as E-cash to 
clients with spare computing power.

A lot of possibilities here... a configuration where a set price is 
offered for a computation (the user can check for the highest offer 
on a server, or refuse an offer below a certain amount).

Or maybe applets would only be doled out to systems that meet a 
certain criteria (minimum computing power).

A more complex system where 'bids' are placed based on computing 
power is possible too (those w/better systems would want more cash, 
or be willing to pay it).

Problem: open to forms of 'abuse' (imagine a sysadmin making 
E-cash using his employer's machines overnight).

It might make an interesting experimental project to work on.
