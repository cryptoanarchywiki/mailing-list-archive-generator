Hi All,

I would like to set up my majordomo to request subscription
confirmations from users, by sending them a cookie. Looking at the
majordomo config files, I have not found such option.

Ideally I would like to have a system that a) requires the
new users confirm new subscriptions and b) once in a while
as users to confirm their existing subscriptions.

Is there any way to do it?

Thank you.

	- Igor.
