Allen, that post had a garbled header, and some people may have missed
it, so I'll repost (your cc line was broken also, being in the subject
field, so I've added your cc line in):

I'd argue for waiting to see the outcome of the moderation experiment,
before rehoming the list.

The multiple host system proposed by Igor sounds like a good idea in
any event.
