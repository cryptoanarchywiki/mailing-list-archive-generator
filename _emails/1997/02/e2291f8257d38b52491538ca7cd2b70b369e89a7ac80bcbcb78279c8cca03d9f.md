News propagation in seconds to your _local server_, or to _distant_
servers? Articles I post do indeed appear "immediately" on my local site,
but certainly not so immediately on distant sites.

The Usenet is thousands of news servers, maybe tens of thousands, and news
feeds take a while...small articles are mixed in with hundreds of megabytes
a day of binaries. A percolation process, as opposed to a point-to-point
process for e-mail.

And I know that my site sometimes does not see articles for tens of hours,
even days, after the initial act of distribution. (Sometimes articles
appear more than a week late...presumably they've been lost to mu site on
some railroad siding someplace.)

This is why people say "News is slower than mail."

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
