No, the charges were not "jail charges". They were for exporting munitions.
He was let off after 2.5 or 2.6.

The urban myth  is that 2.3a is safe.  You can read the source code
yourself.  2.6.2 is fine. Older versions actually have some minor bugs.

You'd be using a version with holes in it. Why not read the source code
of the new version and verify it's security yourself? (If you can't
undertsand it, it won't matter which version you're using because you're
trusting it no matter what.)
