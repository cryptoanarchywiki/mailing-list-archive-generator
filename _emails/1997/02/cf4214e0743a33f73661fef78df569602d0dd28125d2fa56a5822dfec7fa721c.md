Hmm..., word size, number of rounds, and key size are "clues"?  At least he
won't be able to make this claim when DES is cracked.  OTOH, he might consider
a known IV to be information not available under "infowar conditions."
Apparently, "Info Warriors" aren't supposed to be familiar with open standards.

He considers a known-plaintext attack to be "a  giveway![sic]"?  It seems that
this guy could use a few clues himself.
