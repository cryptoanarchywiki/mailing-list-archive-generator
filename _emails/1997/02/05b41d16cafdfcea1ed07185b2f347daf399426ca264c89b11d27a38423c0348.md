I see no evidence to substantiate this claim.  People who would be most likely
to get auto-blocked have managed to get at least one post sent to the moderated
list.

The only thing your previous post proved is that toad.com has a very little
delay between receiving and sending mail to cypherpunks-unedited.  Notice that
the post in question does not have an altered Message-Id and the sender is set
to owner-cypherpunks, not owner-cypherpunks-unedited which appears in all
messages sent to the flames list.

The modification was made after there was the problem of the received headers
exposing the supposedly secret outgoing destination address of the moderated
list.  This change was certainly made before February 6, the date the post in
question was posted.  Also, John would have made this modification; not Sandy.
