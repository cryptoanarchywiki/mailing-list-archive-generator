I hope this doesn't duplicate the earlier message - if someone were
tracking all this activity and kept the lists informed about what
was available where - and particularly if the downloading could be
automatic as in the subscription lists - that would be ideal.

I wanted to spend some time on alt.cypherpunks, but I haven't got
thru the subscription mail for the last few days yet.  If there's
a scheme that works better than just ad-hoc looking, I'd sure like
to know.
