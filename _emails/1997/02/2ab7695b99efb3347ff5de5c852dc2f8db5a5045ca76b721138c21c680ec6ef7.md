Now you've admitted that Sandy, ever more desperate, is grasping
for allies for some future attack.  And you've accused Dr. Vulis
of plotting against Sandy.  Tsk tsk.

This is not the healthy kind of paranoia.

Tim May in the same breath as Dr. Vulis?  I underestimated the level
of desperation here.

Neither I nor (I'm certain) Dr. Vulis are surprised by any of this.
Who were you referring to?

Well, he claims he's not censoring anymore.  If you believe that,
you're probably waiting for the Easter bunny.

Blah blah blah blah.  Bottom line is this:  "Moderation" is really
censorship.  You can go on with this "plausible denial" all you
want to, but the jig is up, so to speak.  They've been caught being
sneaky and deceptive with people's mail.  Naughty naughty.
