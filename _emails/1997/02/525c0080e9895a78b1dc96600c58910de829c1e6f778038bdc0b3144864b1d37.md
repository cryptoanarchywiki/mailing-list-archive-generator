And, of course, Ian's going to teach all this fun stuff in Anguilla next week.

;-).

E-mail me, and I'll refresh your memory with a workshop program, or just
click on the FC97 URL in my .sig, below. We have lots of room. Just don't
take American, though American Eagle's okay...

Shamelessly yours,
P. T. Hettinga
Promotional Chairman,
FC97 Workshop, Conference, and Exhibition
