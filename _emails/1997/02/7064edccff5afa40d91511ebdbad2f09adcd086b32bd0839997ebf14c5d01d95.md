I should be happy that you are bashing a competitor and all, but give
them a break, OK? The marketing dweeb who has to do product pitches
on roadshows is not the same as the design engineer who designs the
system and sets technical standards. There can be a big difference in
technical knowledge about the product, and even basic competency,
between the two.
