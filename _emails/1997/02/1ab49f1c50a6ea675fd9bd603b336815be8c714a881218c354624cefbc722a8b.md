You'll recall that Sandfort (as Logos) ranted without letup about
decorum, decorum, ... ad nauseam, which, now that I look back on
it, is a *very* handy tool for controlling the list.  Logic does
not interfere with decorum, despite the implication of the nym
Logos.

the mail, i.e., when the pony breaks down and can't run for awhile.

The List Lord made it clear "In The Beginning" that some posts would
probably be irretrievably lost due to unavoidable "mistakes".
Think "FBI Crime Lab".  You get the picture.
