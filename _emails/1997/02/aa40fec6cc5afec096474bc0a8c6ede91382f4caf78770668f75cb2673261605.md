I suggest that you munge up your from line and possibly your reply-to
address in Usenet postings.  Folks who actually want to communicate
with you can derive your address from your .sig.

By the way, I have intentions of including your web page(s) as
references in the cypherpunks-resources faq I am producing.  Any
objections to this? (I know it's in your .sig and you want to
advertise it, but it just strikes me as _polite_ to ask.)
