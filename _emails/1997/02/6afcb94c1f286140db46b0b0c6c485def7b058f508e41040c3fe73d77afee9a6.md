Hmmm, I can see saving the address causing the bounce in some sort of array
that is indexed to the majordomo subscription list for a given remailer. It
would not cost anything but overhead to save the entire message. I guess my
motivation was not that I cared their mailbox was full or it was a invalid
address but that I wouldn't be able to deliver at this time. I just don't
see any reason that it helps me to know why they can't receive mail only that
they can't.

	So far as I can tell, there are two types of news2mail gateways
in common usage: newsgate, which is in C, and the standard LISTSERV
bit.listserv.* gatewaying. I don't know C and don't have that much
reason to learn it (perl makes a lot more sense to me); therefore, I'd
need to locate a perl version or let someone else take care of the
actual programming end of it, with me just handling what the programming
person didn't. Hmm... I wonder if Lance would be available for the
programming? I'd probably be using an account on cyberpass.net for the
gateway in any event.
