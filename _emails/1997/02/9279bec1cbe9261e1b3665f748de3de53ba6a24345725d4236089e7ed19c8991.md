Hi!  The following headers are from a posting by John Young
that looks like it was sent to cypherpunks@toad.com,
forwarded to cypherpunks@sirius.infonex.com and/or
cypherpunks@cyberpass.net, and has the Reply-To: header
set to reply to cypherpunks@toad.com instead of to John Young....
It looks like the obvious implementation of cypherpunks-style mail header
patching, but isn't quite right.....  Leads to people sending
their John Young mailbot requests to cypherpunks@toad.com instead,
as some well-known cypherpunks have mistakenly done recently :-)
