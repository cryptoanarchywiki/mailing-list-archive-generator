I never commented about crypto?  Why, I even wrote a crypto program,
which few on this list have done, BTW.

I hope Sandy allows this on the big list, since Michael has penned
a message about me, but said that he won't allow my reply to him.

Nobody has to tell me (or probably anyone else either) that they
have killfiled me (or anyone else).  All they have to do is ignore
me (or anyone else), and there's no further problem, plus, as a
bonus, it makes for less noise on the list.  What say, Michael?
