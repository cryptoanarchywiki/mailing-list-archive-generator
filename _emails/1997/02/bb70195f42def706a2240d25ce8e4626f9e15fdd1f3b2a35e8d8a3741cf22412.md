You may receive (or may have already received) a message that looks like
if it was sent from your own account with the subject line "security
breached by NaughtyRobot".  In the message, you will most likely be told
that all of your personal information has been accessed by NaughtyRobot
and that you should contact the police, disconnect your phone line, cut
up your credit cards and report them as stolen, etc, etc.  DON'T PANIC!
It's just a bad joke someone is playing on you.  For more information on
this issue, read the article at
