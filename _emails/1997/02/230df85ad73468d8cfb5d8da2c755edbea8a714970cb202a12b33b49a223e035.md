Pretty much, yes.  The voting process for a comp group is better, IMO.

But the distributed mailing list is by far the most interesting 
solution.  Contrary to what some have claimed, it really isn't the 
same as usenet -- it allows for distributed control.  There is no 
doubt that the operator of a mail list host should have the freedom 
to set his or her policies as they see fit -- it is their machine, 
and their responsibility.  And contrariwise, subscribers should have 
the freedom to chose list hosts with compatible philosophies.
