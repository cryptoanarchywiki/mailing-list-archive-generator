   Absolutely, It is really, as far as I see it anyway, just a stop-gap 
   measure. The caballers haven`t got enough room to do their censorship 
   on the 18000 or so big 7 groups so they decide to fuck up the alt. 
   heirachy as well ;-)

   Hopefully Igor and co.`s network of Majordomo's should be fully 
   operational soon (as I understand it two are up and a third is on 
   it's way) then we can move back there. Might even get it finished 
   before the 20th?????

Why not a network of news servers with mail<->news gateways on some of
them?  It should even be possible to use the news spool as the queue,
so that only info on who needs what messages need lie around rather
than 42 copies of the message (something like nntpsend, just using
smtp).  I actually have some spare time this weekend to try
implementing this.
