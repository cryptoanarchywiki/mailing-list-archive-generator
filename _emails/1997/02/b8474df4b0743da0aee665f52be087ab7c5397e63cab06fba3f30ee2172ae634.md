Depends on how guessable your passphrase is.  If you use something that would
fall to a dictionary attack, then you are vulnerable.  (Providing that they
actually looked for your keyring and made a copy.)

If you had nyms on your keyring, then those nyms can be associated with your
"true name" with no passphrase required.  (Unless you keep your keyring
encrypted. Private Idaho supports encrypted keyrings, but little else does.)

If you are really concerned about it, you could learn to do your own computer
repairs.
