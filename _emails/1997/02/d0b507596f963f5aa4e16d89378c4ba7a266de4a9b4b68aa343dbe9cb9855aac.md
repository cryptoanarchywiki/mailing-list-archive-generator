mafia used to have a habit of hiring some lonely person do do work for them
(such as, set up their crypto infrastructure), then make him disappear, and he
won' be missed, and they won't have to pay for the work.  Bumping off the people
that you owe money to is bad for one's rep. I'd be reluctant to do consulting
for organized crime for this reason. Perhaps that's why the Feds have such easy
time wiretapping them. :-)
