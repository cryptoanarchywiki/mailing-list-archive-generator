For all of you who didn't see the last X-Files ...
Mulder made a visit to The Lone Gunman about breaking into some
impenetrable system.
Byers points out that "Yeah, that system is pretty hard to get into."
Mulder then inquires "well how did you guys get in?".
Byers replies cooly: "We used a modified Clipper chip we bought back from
the Chinese."
I didn't stop laughing for 5 minutes ... :)
