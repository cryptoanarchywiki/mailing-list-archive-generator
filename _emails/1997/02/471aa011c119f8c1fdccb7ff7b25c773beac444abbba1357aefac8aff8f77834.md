My fellow cypherpunks,

	I wanted to let you all know, we are having a great time, building
a router to the 21st Century, down here in sunny Anguilla.   Al and I will
be wiring Anguilla's great high school for the internet.  Afterwards, we'll
meet with some longtime supporters of the democratic party for a beer.

	Spaces at the conference are still available, I didn't let those
folks at American strike, so you have no excuses to be anywhere else next
week.
