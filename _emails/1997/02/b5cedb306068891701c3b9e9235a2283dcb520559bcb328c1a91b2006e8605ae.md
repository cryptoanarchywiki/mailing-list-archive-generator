Congratulations to Jeremey for printing the world's first Ecash note! I
hereby declare Jeremey the winner of the "encoding Ecash as 2D-bar code"
contest. The money will be awarded this Saturday. Now, we need decoding
software. :-)

[There is a $100 reward (out of my own pocket) for the first freeware
decoder. Source required. This is a "just for fun" contest. I know that
$100 won't pay for the time spent on the project.]
