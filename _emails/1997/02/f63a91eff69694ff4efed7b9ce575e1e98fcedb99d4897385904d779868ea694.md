>
>Some background on Cypherpunks, snipped from the mailing list welcome
>message, follows...
>
>Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were more of it. 
>Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy must create it for
>themselves and not expect governments, corporations, or other large,
>faceless organizations to grant them privacy out of beneficence. 
>Cypherpunks know that people have been creating their own privacy for
>centuries with whispers, envelopes, closed doors, and couriers. 
>Cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other people from speaking about their
>experiences or their opinions. 
>
>The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption. To
>encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt with weak
>cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy. Cypherpunks
>hope that all people desiring privacy will learn how best to defend it. 
>
>Cypherpunks are therefore devoted to cryptography.  Cypherpunks wish to
>learn about it, to teach it, to implement it, and to make more of it. 
>Cypherpunks know that cryptographic protocols make social structures. 
>Cypherpunks know how to attack a system and how to defend it.  Cypherpunks
>know just how hard it is to make good cryptosystems. 
>
>Cypherpunks love to practice.  They love to play with public key
>cryptography.  They love to play with anonymous and pseudonymous mail
>forwarding and delivery.  They love to play with DC-nets.  They love to
>play with secure communications of all kinds. 
>
>Cypherpunks write code.  They know that someone has to write code to
>defend privacy, and since it's their privacy, they're going to write it. 
>Cypherpunks publish their code so that their fellow cypherpunks may
>practice and play with it.  Cypherpunks realize that security is not built
>in a day and are patient with incremental progress. 
>
>Cypherpunks don't care if you don't like the software they write. 
>Cypherpunks know that software can't be destroyed.  Cypherpunks know that
>a widely dispersed system can't be shut down. 
>
>Cypherpunks will make the networks safe for privacy.
