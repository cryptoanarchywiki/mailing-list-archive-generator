Some interesting extracts from the Herson interview from that web
page, Herson speaking:

: ...in practice export control means use control. There is an
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: indirect mechanism, which means that ... If you take the old
: paradigm that exportability means exploitability - the only
: cryptography, that is available to the business and private user is
: exploitable cryptography...

ie They don't care about exports what they care about is stopping
people using strong crypto, but they use export controls as an excuse.

and:

ie law enforcement interests (horsemen of apocalypse, terrorists,
pedophiles, pornographers, etc) are just a smoke screen, what it's
really about is maintaining foreign signals intelligence for cold war
type spy purposes.

Are you sure he works for GCHQ?  I'm shocked ... such honesty.  You'd
never catch Clinton or Freeh admitting the above was the agenda
