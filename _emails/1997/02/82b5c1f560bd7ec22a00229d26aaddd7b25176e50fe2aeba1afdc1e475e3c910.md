Mr. Gilmore
I know that this list has become something of a dead albatross with you, but
I was wondering if you would be willing to do the whole of us another favor.

As you have stated that this list will no longer reside on your machine any
longer.

And as several people have put forward thier own machines upon which to host
this forum in the future.

And as there are people who, though not currently subscribed, know about the
list and may wish to subscribe to the list in the future.

Could you please maintain at least the semblence of a list on your machine.
Not the actual list, but a pointer triggered by a post or majordomo request
concerning cypherpunks.  In this way, persons not currently subscribed but
knowledgeable about the list can find it in the future.

Such a system should be easy to set up, given that you probably already have
autoresponder bots in your hard drive, and would be a great service.

Would you please rig such a system after your deadline in place of the list
to point to which ever system currently has the most alternate traffic?
This would only need to be an interim measure as after a reasonably short
length of time people would get the idea that the list has moved.

Thank you for entertaining this request.
