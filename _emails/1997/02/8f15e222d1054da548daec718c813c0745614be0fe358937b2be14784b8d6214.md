I'm so disgusted by the other disinformation put out by John's loyal
friends (i.e. "respected" cypherpunks) on the subject of "disrupters
and sociopaths", etc. that I try not to reply to any of the crud I
see posted by those clowns.  But when someone tries to be reasonable,
conversation is possible.  So how about some points on "disrupters":

1. Disrupters don't like bullies.
2. Disrupters don't like mindless authorities.
3. Disrupters don't like control freaks.
4. Disrupters don't like liars and hypocrites.
5. Disrupters don't like NSA/CIA/DEA/FBI trolls.
6. Disrupters don't like Animal Farm policies and elitists.

In short, if Gilmore had come down on the real problem people once
in a while, they wouldn't have agitated the "disrupters" nearly as
much as they did.  But he wasn't about to do that, because he's one
of the problem people himself.  Fooey on you, Gilmore.  May you never
work in this business again.
