    are you really saying we must dispose of our time honoured 
    tradition of "the best justice money can buy..." ???  say it is not 
    so; where would our legal system be without body trading?

    as for the communist/socialist ideal of work/need/want where want 
    is suppressed --it does not work; never has, never will. even the 
    religious orders have not made it work over time (other than by 
    fear).

on or about 970201:2218 Jim Choate <ravage@EINSTEIN.ssz.com> said:

+1.  Removal of the lawyer from the ultimate choice of whether the case
+    should be pursued.

    whew, open the floodgates. free lunch.

+2.  The minimalization of the defendants and plaintiffs monetary
+    resources
+    by removing them from the legal system by choosing the legal
+    representation of both parties by lot.

    damn, free dinner, too.

+3.  By moving the responsibility of police to provide evidence from the
+    prosecution to the court we equalize the impact of irregularities
+    in evidence selection as well as minimizing the sorts of evidence
+    disputes which so impact some trials (ie OJ Simpson).

    my, we're on a roll, aren't we?

+4.  By the implimentation of a bond proviso on the part of the
+    plaintiff
+    the system provides a check and balance reducing nuisance cases as
+    well as reducing the taxation load on the citizenry.

    this is already a factor in the need to pay an attorney his 
    ridiculous fees. being required to post a plaintiff's bond does 
    nothing to equalize the rights of the have nots --most of whom seem 
    to have unlimited resources from the dogooders anyway.

    Get real, Jim.  it may not be the best system, but other than 
    enforcing the principles on which it is founded, and stripping 
    attorney privileges to a percentage of the take, the system works 
    quite well; corruption on the bench is whose fault?  ours, just 
    like the excesses in Washington are our fault.

    it is _our_ failure to insist on clean, representative government 
    and judiciary.  and to convert to a pooled system for equality is 
    not going to stop graft -it is built in to human greed.  

    stop apathy on _our_ part, and we will stop graft.
