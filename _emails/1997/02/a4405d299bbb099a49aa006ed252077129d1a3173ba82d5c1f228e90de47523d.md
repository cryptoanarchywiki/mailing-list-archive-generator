The "us" I mentioned did not refer to the freedom knights, but "those
of us who -truly- want free speech"...a slight english parsing
problem. The freedom knights are a subset of those who want free
speech.

It is our ability to act as ourselves, freely and of our own choosing,
that is the greatest gift to mankind; my Creator, the sole being in the
universe who legitimately had power over me, gave me that power freely
in order to enable me to become what I am.                  -- Russ Allbery
