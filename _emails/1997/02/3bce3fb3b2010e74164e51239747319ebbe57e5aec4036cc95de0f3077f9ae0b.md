I sincerely doubt that many would use AP to right small slights, anymore
than many now kill others for the same reasons.  The world has always been
inhabited by bullies and tyrants who cared little of what harm they caused
others.  An AP system would quickly eliminate bullies and tyrants.

Some of them.  But like an infection which can be potentialy killed with 
antibiotics, ignoring the unhealthy conditions which made it possible to 
establish itself will frustrate the attempts to prevent the phenomena of 
its recurrence.
