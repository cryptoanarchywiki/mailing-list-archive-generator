While it is true I was planning on bringing the Austin Cpunks remailer back
(kourier.ssz.com) this rather unexpected expansion has got me backpedalling.
So it looks like it will take about 3 weeks to get the intial site ready for
public access.

Right now my ISDN based site is all we have working. We have another site
through another ISP in the process of registering and configuration. I have
currently created a 'cypherpunks@ssz.com' but still have a couple of other
issues to work out. The most relevant one is that I will be upgrading both
Linux and Majordomo in approx. 2 weeks. We will be discussing this issue
further on Saturday at the Austin Cypherpunks meeting. If all goes well with
our discussion and my upgrade we should have the SSZ cypherpunks site
available in about 2 weeks. Sten and I hope that we can pursuade some others
to get involved both running remailers as well as modifying the various
scripts. At this point everything we do will be released to the public
domain. We also are expecting to add a proviso that all submissions to the
cpunks distributed remailer will be de facto public domain unless a specific
'fair use' header is included in each submission.

Finaly, another issue that will slow me down is the upcoming SRL show here
in Austin. I have committed time and effort so I don't know yet how the
conflicts will come or how I will resolve them. The next SRL planning meet
is Thu. nite so I will have a clearer idea of my upcoming schedule.

These are several of the issues that we will be discussing this Saturday.
We will also be looking at various means to distribute the subscriber list.
The current lead suggestion is to have subscriptions at any of the cpunks be
evenly distributed among them. This would somewhat complicate the subscriber
process.

Another aspect that I am hot to trot on is setting the system up so that
some of the cpunks sites could be anonymous, crypto, or combo remailers as
well.
