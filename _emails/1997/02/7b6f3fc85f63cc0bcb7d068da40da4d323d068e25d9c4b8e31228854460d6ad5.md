Why does it not surprise me that TIS gets permission to export 56-bit (DES?) ?
They do key recovery (is it GAK?) They brag about government consulting. The
clients they will admit to having are listed on:
http://www.tis.com/docs/products/consulting/govt/govcon.html
and, purely unsubstantiated rumors here, but I've heard (seen) TIS, NSA, FBI 
and other  "friends" of ours all together in the same paragraph. Conspiracy?
Maybe... This is both good and bad.... yes, longer codes are now exportable,
but only to / by certain people?

I notice that the new cipher length is 56 bit...same size as DES? hopefully
that's just a coincidence (yeah, right) or maybe somebody's starting to see
the real world where people download pirate cryptosystems and says "so let's
export bigger ones and make a buck off it, too..." (yeah, right)
