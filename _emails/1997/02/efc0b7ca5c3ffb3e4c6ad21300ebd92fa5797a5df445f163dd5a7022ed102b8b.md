Don't let the old-fashioned look deceive you.  Most mail storage boxes
use lever tumbler locks (similar to what's used in safe deposit
vaults, though obviously the mailbox locks have a flimsier plug).
Lever tumbler locks are in general much harder to pick than pin
tumbler locks (the kind on most doors).
