What does it mean "now dead and ignored"?  Today, the L.A. Times had
more major coverage of the issue and how the L.A. school board is
pushing ahead on Ebonics.  There were several examples of books given
in the article which used Ebonics (more-or-less) the their choice of
linquistic style.  I'd say it's just getting off the ground.
