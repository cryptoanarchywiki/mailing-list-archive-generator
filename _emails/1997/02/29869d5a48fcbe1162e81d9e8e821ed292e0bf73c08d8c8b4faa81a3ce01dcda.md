     Good does not necessarily mean efficient, and efficient does not
necessarily mean good. 

    Picture--if you can--the "perfect" centrally planned economy where all
possible market conditions, wants and needs are taken into account. Factories
are placed optimally for access to natural resources and distribution to 
consumers etc. Also assume that the people running this society _are_ intersted
in efficient production methods, and activly look for new and better ways of 
getting things done--benign facism/socialism if you will. This would (assuming 
perfect people, but bear with me) be the _most efficient_ method of producing 
and delivering goods, but it would introduce certain "choke points", one 
natural disaster or war could cripple production of necessary items. 

    Picture anarchy, massively redundant, and resistent to this problem, while
probably not anywhere _near_ as efficient, this "system" would have the ability
to absorb damage and adapt more rapidly to changing enviroments.

     Stable is a relative thing. Are things stable now? If you think so, you
either aren't looking very hard, or you are giving "stable" a wide range.
