  Let's clear a few things up right off the bat here.  This whole thing
  was done strictly out of complete boredom with the participation
  of a small group of people, mainly online friends.  Needless to say
  it has grown at a seemingly exponential rate, putting us somewhere
  in the ballpark of having a "real shot" at this.

  Source code was initially released on a very early version of the
  RC5-client, after a half dozen or so rogue clients started up, we
  decided to quickly strop distributing source code until the whole
  client->server protocol could be devised "the right way"..  Source
  code for "current" client will be released as well, hopefully very
  soon now.

  Well documentation for what it is doing?  It's uh, doing some math
  or something; that's retarded.

  Documentation for running?  Well, I suppose anyone unfamiliar with normal
  ``man(1)'' style syntaxing would find it cryptic at best, but it should
  be fairly straight forward.  Now that there actually seems to be extensive
  participation in this, we're doing a FAQ on the website.  Hopefully this
  will alleviate alot of this.

  Generally I dont waste my time dealing with such ludicrous issues.  You
  people should all realize, that no matter what you do, no matter how
  you do it, as soon as it hit's mailing lists or newsgroups, someone has
  opinions about it, as well as "a better way of doing it".  Well whatever,
  it's all just a monumental waste of bandwidth.

  If you are speaking of the website statistics, well I'm not even going
  to get involved in this.  I'm working on "doing it right" as time
  permits.  I didnt have much to do with the one that is up there now.

  This is due to the fact that you have a bum client :)  New clients,
  (all compiles are being verified by me before put online) are becomming
  available now.  Proxies for all of the platforms we're supporting will
  be available too; caching proxies underway as well.

  The vast majority of the initial clients were not ported by my me.

  Uh, terrific.

  I'm getting more and more distressed about this utter waste of bandwidth
  the further down I get here.

  I will put specifics on how the server assigns keyspace onto the website
  in due time.  Frankly, I do not expect, or care, to be the one to break
  this key.  I in no way, shape or form, give unfair advantages to any
  of the participants.  Keys are assigned, they are not ranked and assigned
  based on any preference whatsoever.  This is pretty ridiculous.

  The client allows you to participate in the RC5-56 contest (at no unfair
  advantage or disadvantage).  That is the bottom line.  If you wish to
  participate, we'd greatly welcome any instructions you can spare.  If
  you don't, that's fine too, best of luck.
