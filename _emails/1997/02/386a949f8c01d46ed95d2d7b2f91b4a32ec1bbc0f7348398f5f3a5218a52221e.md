On the contrary. 

John Grubor is Usenet's most effective probe as to the mindset of
people who really want free speech. The precise litmus test of
free speech is vehemently offensive things that are spoken.

Then they don't want free speech. They want the illusion of free
speech, "free speech as long as you don't say THOSE things".

Don't you get it? Real censorship issues do not arise until someone
rocks the boat. It takes someone to rock the boat to make you aware
of your own prejudices of that nature. If it takes attacking
homosexuals and pissing them off enough to make them show their
true colors and begin censorship...so be it. Why be civil when that
civility serves to hide that which is ultimately against free speech?

You'll find those of us who -truly- want free speech are extremely
good at ignoring what we don't like.
