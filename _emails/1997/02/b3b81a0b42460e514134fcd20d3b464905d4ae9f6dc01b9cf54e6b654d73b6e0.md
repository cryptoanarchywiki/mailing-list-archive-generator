Listen to it, John is absolutely right. Running a big mailing list is
an incredible commitment and it is important to realize what you are 
getting into.

Another suggestion may be to set sendmail expire option to one day
instead of five so that messages that cannot be delivered would bounce
faster and not clog the queue.
