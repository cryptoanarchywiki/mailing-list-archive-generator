In Cu Digest, #9.07 -- see Cu Digest Homepage: 
	http://www.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/  *
is a nice article on how an Italian mailing list 
was blocked by the University bureaucracy.
    LISA (Lista Italiana Sull'Accesso a Internet) is
    "an unmoderated area devoted to discussion about social, cultural
    and economic aspects related to the development of the Internet in Italy."

Two days later they were up and running on a machine in Utah.

> Choosing censorship instead of an open debate is 
> something we will never be willing to silently accept.
