To quiet him from political dissent, presumably.  I think the term coined a 
few years ago was "SLAPP", something akin to "Strategic Lawsuit Against 
Public Policy," or similar.  

For example, "Company A" wants to build a mine or factory or something 
similar at a location.  Citizens object, causing political problems.  
Company sues the individuals for damages, which costs the individuals a 
great deal of money to defend against even if they never lose the suit.

The real problem is actually a series of mistakes:

1.  Individual should not be able to cause political problems for company.

2.  "Government" should not be able to impact company activities short of 
actual harm.

3.  Company should not be able to impact individual by suing except for 
actual harm done by that individual.


Naturally, the source of these problems is that by each of their existence, 
lawyers make more money.


As usual, I have a solution to that problem.
