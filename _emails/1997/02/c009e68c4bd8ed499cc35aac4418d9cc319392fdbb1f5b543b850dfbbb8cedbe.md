We have to stop this tragic corruption of the English language,
to protect our childen's delicate ears and aesthetic sensibilities.
Why, a mere few months ago, I encountered a child of no more than 10
singing along to 
	"You Can Build A Mainframe From The Things You Find At Home" -
corrupted by the adults in his environment into praising equipment that
should never have been built by mankind and should be allowed to lie still,
undiscovered for the rest of history.  And this poor child knew all the words.
Shocking.  Our public schools have clearly failed to educate him correctly.
