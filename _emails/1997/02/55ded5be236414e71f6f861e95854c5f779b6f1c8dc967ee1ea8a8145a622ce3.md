Now that cypherpunks is moving, to both a newsgroup and one or more 
mailing lists, there's still a need for cypherpunks-announce or 
something like it.  So far it's carried 1-2 announcements per month.

Should we create it as a mailing list, moderated or unmoderated,
or as a newsgroup?  (It's been a moderated mailing list, run by John and
Hugh.)
Perhaps the right implementation is a mail exploder going to
several moderators in parallel, any of whom can forward to the list,
just to cut down delays?
