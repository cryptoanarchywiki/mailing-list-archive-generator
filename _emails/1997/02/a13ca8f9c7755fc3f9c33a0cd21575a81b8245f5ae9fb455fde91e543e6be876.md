It is not only because of that. There are two categories of people
who simply do not visit com.* groups: sex spammers and trollers
(who post articles like I RAPED A NIGGER CHILD to tens of newsgroups).

If the group is created in a space that is isolated from them, that is
already good.

As for net.cops, check out what Scott Nudds does in comp.lang.c++

Chris Lewis can exclude newsgroups from his spam watch. I think that
if cypherpunks put something forbidding third party cancels into the
charter, he will not cancel stuff posted there.

Yes, there is a notorious net.cop The Right Reverend Colin James III (spit).

A sample of his stukachestvo is attached at the bottom of this letter.

| In the same file where you define INT16, UINT32, etc, add the following:

| #ifdef AIX
|   typedef long INT32;
|   #define F_INT32 "ld"
| 
|   typedef unsigned short UINT16;
|   #define F_UINT16 "u"
| #endif
| 
| #ifdef YOUR_FAVORITE_MACHINE
|   typedef short INT32; // Maybe for 64-bit machines, never worked with them
|   #define F_INT32 "d"
| ... etc etc ...
| 
| Then you define your user types: 
| 
|   typedef INT32 DollarAmount_t;
|   #define DollarAmount_f INT32_F // You make it a rule to define
|                                  // formats right along with types
| 
| Usually, in scanf (and printf) people write things like this: 
| 
|       printf( "%ld is the dollar amount for customer %4.4d\n", 
|               amount, cust );
| 
| Instead, you write
| 
|       printf( "%" DollarAmount_f " is the dollar amount for customer "
|               "%4.4" Cust_f,
|               amount, cust );
| 
| It is a totally portable code. All you need to port primitive types
