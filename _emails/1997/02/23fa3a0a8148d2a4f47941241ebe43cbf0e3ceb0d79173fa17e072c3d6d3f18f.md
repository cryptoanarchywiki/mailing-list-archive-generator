	A: not all alt newsgroups
	B: not in an anonymous fashion (the anonymizer blocks from
		requesting files from dejanews)
	As someone not currently on USENET, I'd request that _somebody_
put up a bi-directional gateway; I'll put in a request to
list-managers@greatcircle.com for advice & suggestions, and will
suggest that it get cc'd to cypherpunks@toad.com.
