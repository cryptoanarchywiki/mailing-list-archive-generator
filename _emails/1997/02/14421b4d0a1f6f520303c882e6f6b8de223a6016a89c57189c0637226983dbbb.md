If you are interested in the on-going debate over ISP access charges, I
sugest you look at a newly published report perpared for the Internet
Access Coalition.  It stomps on the RBOC assertions that dial-in access to
the Net is having a generally negative impact on their telephone networks
from both performance and financial asapects.
