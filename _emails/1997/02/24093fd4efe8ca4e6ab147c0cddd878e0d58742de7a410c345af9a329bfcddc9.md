There's a list of Executive Orders from 1970-96 on emergency powers
at:

   http://jya.com/eo-export.txt

A related Presidential Notice is at:

   http://jya.com/no081496.htm

Some of the latest Executive Orders related to export administration
are listed under "background" at:

   http://jyacom/eartoc.htm

The range of consequences of "emergency power" is vast, and 
traces of its affect is found in many governmental regulations and
legislation. We're adding documents to our site as we find them,
from the Departments of State, Defense and Commerce:
