By the way, I say "FORGET IT" to the NSA Rainbow manuals. A worthless pile
of crap.

I subscribed to them several years ago, got the Big Box of Manuals, and
then got  new editions every few months for several years. None of them
were ever useful to me in even the slightest way.

They are written in "bureaucratese," so they're not even fun reading.

If they're not on the Web by now it just shows what a sicko government
agency the NSA and NCSA is, and if they _are_ on the Web, you'll see what I
mean quickly enough.

Even for "novelty value" ("Hey, Tim, the mail guy just delivered a package
from the National Security Agency!") the books are worth very little.

Do a tree a favor and just say No to the Rainbow series.

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
