Well, I only subscribe to the Flames list--there is no doubt about this.

In any case, what is the meaning of a message going only to the "Unedited"
list?  A message that goes to the Unedited list but _not_ to the Flames
list must surely go to the Main list, right?

That is,

MAIN list + FLAMES list = UNEDITED list

Isn't this the way it works, that the Unedited list is the union of the
MAIN and FLAMES lists, which are disjoint?

So, since the Vulis message on anonymous remailers did not appear on the
MAIN list, it must have appeared on the FLAMES list.

You keep saying this ("the list is better, the list is better, the list is
better"). Repeating it enough may make it true, for you.

In any case, my point is that there were no "flame" triggers in either of
the messages you sent to the Flames list. Unless you are rejecting based on
your opinion of the views expressed, these messages belong on the main list.

Sandy, you are a sloppy moderator. An incompetent, in fact. Get better fast
or knock off the pretense that you know better than we do what Cypherpunks
are ready to read.
