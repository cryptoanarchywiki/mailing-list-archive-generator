I didn`t save it but it was something along the lines of this:

Charter:

alt.cypherpunks will serve as a discussion forum for the members of 
the cypherpunks community. The discussion group previously resided on 
a mailing list run at toad.com but due to a difference of opinion 
between the majority of active members of the list and the owner of 
toad.com, John Gilmore, the list must now relocate onto usenet as a 
temporary measure while further measures are put in place to 
re-establish a mailing list format. The group has approximately 1500 
members and has been active online for some 5 years.
