  I'm writing from the Freedom Knights list but am in no way
representing them.
  
  What exactly do you mean by 'taking steps to limit the abuse'?  
Personally I think much of what is called abuse is nonsense and
that all posts, with the exception of cancels/NoCems should be
propogated regardless of content (including what is currently
referred to as spam).

  Also--could you forward to the Freedom Knights list a copy of
your 'usage policy' and impressions on the Freedom Knights two
FAQs.

  Thanks,

  Steve
