Hi,

Just a reminder that next Saturday, Feb. 15, 1997, is the next date set for
a Austin Cypherpunks meeting. It is to be held at the Central Market HEB
restaurant starting at 6pm. Look for the table with the 2nd. ed. (red cover)
Applied Cryptography.

The meeting is open to the public so remember to tell folks about it.

On another issue, I and another Austin Cypherpunk have decided to start a
distributed cypherpunks list. It would consist of some number of majordomo
remailers, possibly with anonymous extensions, running customer scripts to
allow membership on the mailing list to be distributed and hence
(hopefuly) uncencorable. This will eventualy involve the re-birth of the
anonymous remailer (kourier.ssz.com) project.


                                                   Jim Choate
                                                   ravage@ssz.com
