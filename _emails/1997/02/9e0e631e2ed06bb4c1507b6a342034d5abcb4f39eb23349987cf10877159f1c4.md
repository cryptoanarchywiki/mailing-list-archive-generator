I'm ex-Navy and worked as a contractor for the last 5 years since I got out.
>From my operational experience and exposure to certain area's I would have
to say that 500,000 might be more accurate than you suspect. They are used
at most Navy facilities as the "standard" desk phone when the command
requires operational security telecommunications access. Personnel Offices
etc., probably don't have but one or two per facility but sites requiring
them have them everywhere. Likewise most contractor facilities that require
secure telecommunications have them available as well.
