Actually, it was 259 _machines_, but 4 of them were 8-processor UltraSPARCs
(by far the coolest machines I had access to), for a total of 287 processors.

The "special" network used by the NOW cluster was irrelevant; I didn't use
it at all.  I used the machines on the NOW and 120 other HP workstations
as regular TCP/IP clients.  I started them by simply logging in to each
machine, one at a time with "rsh" (well, "krsh" or "ssh" where appropriate).
