Friends,
I have been on the list since May 1993, after reading about it in Wired
1.2. The list impacted my life more than any other medium.
I knew little about cryptography when I joined the list. Now I work in the
field. Some of the subscribers on this list have become my personal
friends. Many have become co-workers or clients. The list has been good to me.

But it is time to move on. Cypherpunks@toad.com has come to an end, and
perhaps it was time.

See you all on USENET

mailto:cypherpunks@toad.com is dead. Long live news:alt.cypherpunks

Umsuscrive message follows ;-)
