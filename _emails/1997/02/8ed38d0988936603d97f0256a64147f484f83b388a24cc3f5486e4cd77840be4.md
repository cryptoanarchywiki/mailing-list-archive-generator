Attila:  I am shocked that you would make this statement.  What makes 
you think that the 'regulators' would go away, once the greedy spammers 
"toned down their greed"?  Spammers as Predators?  Are you being 
sarcastic?  Are you seriously saying that spammers are preying on the 
weak?

I am one-thousand % AGAINST regulation of any sort.

If cooperation means regulation, count me out.
