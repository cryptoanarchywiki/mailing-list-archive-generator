+Attila and I have had this disagreement before (last time it involved
+Attila's support for curfews).

+Attila is free to hire agents to screen his mail so he does not receive
+spam. He is not free, in a free society, to force such screeners upon
+me.

    very true. if you if define that your freedom includes the free 
    abuse of your freedoms by others.  freedom is a two way street; 
    freedom in my book says that I can do anything I wish which does 
    not infringe on the rights of others. now, that implies that I can 
    _personally_ exact justice on those who violate my space.  this is 
    a state of war which even Jim Bell's AP does not cover --AP is just 
    an anonymous and chicken-hearted way of settling the score, and 
    creates its own code even more absurb than the rules coming down 
    from Washington.

    and, I can not imagine you really believe the basic animals of our 
    society and the predators who attempt to feed upon us all do not 
    need to be restrained in one way or another.  you obviously have
    a solution: your .44 (I prefer a full choke 12 ga pump).

    maybe the comment in my sig line is an expression of the suppressed 
    feelings of the frustrated members of our society who have been 
    confronted by the inequities of our legal system when they expected 
    redress was their right.

+Talking about "irresponsible tones" and "greed" and how we need more
+laws to protect ourselves from "predators" sounds more like something
+from the Marin County limousine liberal set than from a Utah mountain
+man Cypherpunk. I'm shocked, simply shocked.

    shocked, simply shocked?  (:-})  marin county? I'm insulted <g>

    tell you what: you run afoul of us out here on the "mountain" where 
    there is no need for social niceties --we just call it "range law."
