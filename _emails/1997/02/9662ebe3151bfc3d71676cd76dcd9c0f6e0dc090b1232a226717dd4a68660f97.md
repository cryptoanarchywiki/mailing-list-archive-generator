I have posted a rather lengthy story about Germany's war against the 
Scientologists. It was long enough to preclude mailing it directly to the 
lists, so I have put it on my web site. You may find it at:

	http://www.dis.org/se7en/

with the link being directly under the large "X." I decided to post it 
for the reasons that I know several people who suffered directly at the 
hands of the Scientologists after trying to infiltrate their organization 
via the Internet. These people will recieve this message due to this 
posting. Enjoy.
