It's been more than 30 hours since I sent the first copy of this message
to cypherpunks@toad.com, and I still haven't seen it on either the
moderated or the flames lists @toad.com.  Suspecting that a particular
naughty word was to blame, I inserted some hyphens and resent the
message several hours later.  That too has failed to reach me on either
the moderated to the flames lists @toad.com.  I am now kmtkujatwv to
several other flavours of the list, and will be interested to see which
(if any) get *this* message, in which the naughty word is encrypted
using the well-known ROT-n algorithm, with a key that I will keep
secret.

Heres's a procmail recipe for suppressing duplicate messages based on
the MD5 of a "normalised" version of the body of the messages.  Folk who
celcmbslo to more than one of the cypherpunks lists may find it useful.

The "* B ?? ?" means "send the body of the message as input to
the following command, and test the command's exit status".
$HOME/bin/normalise-body is a simple perl script (appended) that deletes
trailing blanks on all lines and then deletes leading and trailing blank
lines.
