Vin, your words are poignant and heartfelt.  To be honest, I share your
feelings (but I can't help but be amused that having recently decided to
resubscribe after a lengthy absence, I returned just in time to wallow into
a sea of discontent -- sorta like walking out the door of the cabin and all
the snow on the roof falling on your head -- you're cold, you're wet, and
you feel pretty damn stupid to boot).

However, the denizens of this place are a resourceful lot.  If
alt.cypherpunks doesn't work out, if the distributed mailing lists don't
work, we'll try something else.  I don't think anyone is ready to give up,
yet.

best,
