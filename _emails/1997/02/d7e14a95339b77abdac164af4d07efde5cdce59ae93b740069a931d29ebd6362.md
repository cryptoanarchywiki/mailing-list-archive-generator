	Someone with more experience correct me if I'm wrong (I'm just
starting to learn about mailing list management), but isn't saving
at least the first bounce from a given address good in order to check
what address is the one that's actually bouncing? Admittedly, this only
applies to badly-formed bounces. The rest can just have the address
noted.

	Agreed.

	Give me some idea of how much programming knowledge, time, etcetera
is required, please, before I can answer. I'd be renting space on some other
computer (e.g., an account on cyberpass.net) to do it in; the only higher-level
programming language (i.e., beyond Applesoft Basic) that I know anything of
is Perl (and I don't know that all that well); and I am somewhat busy with
other stuff. In other words, it depends.
