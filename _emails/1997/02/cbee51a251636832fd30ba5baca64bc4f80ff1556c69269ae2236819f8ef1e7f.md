Raph's remailer list is at
   http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html
and indicates lots of different remailer features,
including whether they accept or require PGP,
and what reliability they've been getting recently.

The remailer that was shut down was the remailer named "lead";
you may have noticed that your reply went to a machine named "zinc".....
