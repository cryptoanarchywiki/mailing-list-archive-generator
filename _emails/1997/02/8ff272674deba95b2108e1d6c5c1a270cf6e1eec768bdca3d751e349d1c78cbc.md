	And once I'm up and running, my cypherpunks list server will
not be interconnected with any server which has a similar AUP.  The
implication of the AUP is that if you _don't_ comply with it, you will
be blocked.  Without such an implication, the AUP is meaningless, and
I'm dedicated that there should be no filtering/blocking of any kind,
of the list.  Persons behaving 'unacceptably' should be handled by
social pressures by others in the 'community' of the list, and not by
policies of the list operators.
