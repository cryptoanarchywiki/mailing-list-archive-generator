So instead of all of the keys being stored in some guarded vault, the parent
key which each chip uses to encrypt part of the users key when transmitting
is kept in some guarded vault.
That way they get the key in some 10 messages unless you rotate often.

Or the keys are assigned according to some unusual system.  Assuming that
only 10,000,000 people were interested in the cards, then only 2^24 keys, or
16777216 keys need to be assigned.  An additional 100+ bits of "key" can be
thrown in, so long as the government has those, or can reconstruct them from
the others.
If you can only affect part of the key, can't a brute force attack get you,
knowing that certain random digits were always the same?
Of course this would become too obvious really soon, unless some elaborate
system were used to rotate the garbage.  such as having bits 2, 5, 9, 11,
12, 14, and 19 tell which of 128 different garbage sets to throw in.
Please correct me if this is unfounded.
Please inform me if I'm on the right track.
Please tell me that I'm just irrationally paranoid so I can get some help.
