Now, if you didn`t have shit for brains you would have followed the 
instructions I sent you last time on how to unsubscribe from the 
cypherpunks mailing list. However, as you evidently have no wit or 
intelligence whatsoever, nor do you seem able to comprehend 
anything phrased in standard English here are the instructions in 
moron.


To unsubscribe from the piss-ant motherfuckers mailing list you are 
giong to have to dooo teh folwoing:

Send a piss-ant message to majordomo@toad.com with the *MESSAGE BODY* reading
exactly as follows:

unsubscribe cypherpunks 2ndsun@bigfoot.com

Either this or contact postmaster@bigfoot.com and ask him to mailkill 
all mailing list traffic for you.
