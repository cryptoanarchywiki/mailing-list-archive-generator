   Yes, I installed INN and ran a few hundred test messages through it last
   night. My machine will be on the net full-time Thursday or Friday. Will yours
   be ready then, too? 

We've got INN here. I created a cpunks.general group (as well as
alt.cypherpunks) on taz.nceye.net and made both world-accessible.  Our
feed hasn't got alt.cypherpunks yet; is someone who has got it willing
to feed it?  (also, is there a consensus on what group names to use:
new top-level hierarchy? cpunks or cypherpunks? or just the alt group,
with the usual propagation and spam problems?)
