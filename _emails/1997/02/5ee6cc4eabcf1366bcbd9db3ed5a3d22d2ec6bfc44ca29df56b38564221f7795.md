Actually, I noticed that often times the posts were out of order when they
got to me over about two months ago.  This was probably due to my location
on the mailing list heirachy, (another reason for a distributed list).  I
also remember there being a rather lengthy delay between my posting
something to the list and it getting sent to me by toad.  (I stayed at the
computer reading other messages, erasing them and checking if any more had
been sent.  This was, is, my primary way of keeping my eudora disk from
getting clogged to the point where it won't compress.)
The problems that you describe aren't new to the list, mostly they are the
product of a long list of subscribers.  Although, manual moderation
certainly adds time between posting and turnaround.
