So, if a person uses a computer fax-modem and, therefore, paper,
toner, etc. aren't used, does this change the situation?  

Suddenly we're very close to the situation of junk-email.  (Except
that the sender of the junk fax incurs long-distance charges, if there
are any, not to mention he pays for the phone service the same as you 
do)

"There should be a law!"  5 of the ugliest words in the English
language when put together.

Look.  I understand your sentiment and junk faxes piss me off as well,
but the cost of government regulation is too high in my opinion.  As
I'm sure you're aware, government does a *great* job of creating
sensible and useful regulations.

Unfortunately, fax machines can't distinguish the text of messages, so
you can't do filtering or bounce messages, etc.  (Although I have been
known to send a nasty reply fax or two.  And I never fail to call the
send of the fax to complain and have the junk faxes terminated)

You purchased the fax equipment.  Why should the government regulate
its usage for you?  

Ideally, the manufacture of fax machines which are able to
authenticate a sender in some manner before permitting the actually
permitting transmission of the fax out to paper would likely eliminate
junk faxes.

Of course, this would involve strong encryption.  And -- wouldn't you
know it! -- that's covered by a range of confusing and threatening
federal regulations
