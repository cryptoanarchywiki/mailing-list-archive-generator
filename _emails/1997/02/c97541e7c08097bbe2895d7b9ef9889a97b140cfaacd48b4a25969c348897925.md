Check the Readers Guide for the last couple of years.  I don't have my
Popular Electronics collection handy, but not too long ago they put out the
plans to a smaller unit based around some Cell Phone part.  It operated on a
single frequency as opposed to a varient modulation of the voice.  This
allowed the unit to be much smaller and simpler, sacrificing some of the
accuracy for a reasonable price (PC board, parts and case available for, I
think, less than $100).  The whole unit fit in a case about the size of a
transistor radio and used a couple of bar graph displays (LED) for output.
The whole operating theory is regulary printed with the schematics, and a
parts list and foil diagrams are included for those who want to make the
project from scratch.

While your at it, look up the subliminal mixer from about 1992, I made one
of these and only prevented from using it by the lack of a decent power supply.

The single frequency mentioned above is further explained in the text.

The local library can get a copy of either of these issues, or any others
that catch your interest, for you if you ask really nicely.
