As further evidence that Dale is unworthy to participate in any socially interactive behaviour other than grinding (that is, grinding) his nose in the naysayers, collective ass, I submit that he posts mixed and otherwise unclear metaphores.

Ipso facto.

As difficult as the good doctor can be, Dale is not intellectually worthy to lick his boots, though he tries.

And, cc: Doctor V., no less. What cabal is this with cc's in the clear? 

Love you, fella.
(You can tell, can't you.)
