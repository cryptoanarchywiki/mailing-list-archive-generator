>MR. BELL:
>
>I FOUND YOUR QUERY ABOUT VOICE STRESS ANALYSIS ON THE INTERNET, AND I TOO,
>HAVE FOUND A DEARTH OF INFORMATION THERE - UNTIL NOW.
>
>I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT VOICE STRESS ANALYSIS (VSA) IS ALIVE AND WELL.  IT
>HAS BEEN QUIETLY PERFORMING IN THE SHADOW OF THE POLYGRAPH FOR MANY YEARS.
> NOW, HOWEVER, IT IS COMING INTO ITS AND IS USED IN MANY STATES TO AID IN
>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND OTHER APPLICATIONS.
>
>AMONG ITS OTHER BENEFITS, VSA REQUIRES NO INTIMIDATING HOOKUP TO THE
>SUBJECT'S BODY, IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE LEVEL OF STRESS.  IT CAN BE CONDUCTED
>VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE - EVEN WHERE NO ELECTRICITY IS PRESENT.  PERHAPS MOST
>PERTINENT TO YOUR QUESTION, VSA CAN BE SOMETIMES PERFORMED ON PEOPLE WHO ARE
>NO LONGER AROUND, THROUGH THEIR RECORDED VOICES.  THIS IS CALLED "NARRATIVE
>ANALYSIS" AND IS SOMEWHAT TOUGHER THAN THE BASIC QUESTION - AND -ANSWER
>APPROACH, SINCE THE EXAMINER CANNOT CONTROL THE CONTENT AND SEQUENCE OF
>QUESTIONS, IF THE SOURCE IS A PAST RECORDING.
>
>THE DIOGENES GROUP, INC., OF WHICH I AM PRESIDENT, HAS DEVELOPED A TOTALLY
>DIGITAL APPROACH TO VSA, AND BEGAN DELIVERING SYSTEMS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT
>AGENCIES IN DECEMBER, 1996.  THE PREMIER DIOGENES VSA PRODUCT IS REDUCED TO
>THE SIZE OF A NOTEBOOK COMPUTER, BUT PRODUCES REALTIME PROCESSING FOR
>SOFTCOPY DISPLAY, AND HARDCOPY PRINTING WITHIN SECONDS.
>
>YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE PREVIOUS STATE-OF-THE-ART, WHICH WAS A
>RELATIVELY LARGE ANALOG MACHINE, USING A SINGLE CHANNEL AND PRINTING OUT THAT
>DATA ON A ROLL OF THERMAL PAPER.  THOSE DAYS ARE GONE FOREVER.  
>
>IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ON THE DIOGENES GROUP AND ITS PRODUCTS,
>PLEASE USE THIS CHANNEL TO SEND ME YOUR MAILING ADDRESS, PHONE NUMBER, AND
>FAX NUMBER.
>
>THANKS FOR YOUR INTEREST IN VOICE STRESS ANALYSIS.
>
>SINCERELY,
