Fortezza now comes in several implementations for various, variable
and multiple levels of classification and message handling. There is info on 
latest mani-dexterous products at NSA's armadillo and missi sites.

If you don't want to be logged by NSA, see the Mykronyx bouquet at:

To be sure, you might get logged anyway: jya.com may have been
approved by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts for a 
snoop.
