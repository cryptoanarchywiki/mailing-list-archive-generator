	What precisely do those laws say? As a scientist, I have somewhat
of an interest in such subjects, and I don't have very good access to
legal databases. (For instance, I tried the Library of Congress search
system for laws passed since 1973... and the thing's indexed by _title_
of legislation, not the more standard designation you gave...).
	Thanks,
	-Allen
