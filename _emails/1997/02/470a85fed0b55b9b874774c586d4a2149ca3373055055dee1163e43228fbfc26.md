The solution is not to choose a trusted remailer, but to choose a
group of remailers and send your message through each one
sequentially. If you use encryption, and any one of the remailers you
send your message through is trustworthy, than it is difficult or
impossible for someone to trace your message.

Here are some places to go to find more info on remailers:
http://WWW.CSUA.Berkeley.EDU/cypherpunks/remailer/
http://www.stack.nl/~galactus/remailers/index-anon.html
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html (Look at the
bottom, there's everything you need to know there.)

Please bear in mind that anon.penet.fi no longer exists, and that it
wasn't all that secure when it did.

Hope this helps, and happy growing :-)
