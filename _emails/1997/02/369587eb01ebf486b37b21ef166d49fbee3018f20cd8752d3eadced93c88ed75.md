On the below:  Remember in "I, Mudd" where the Captain said to Rodney
the Robot: "I'm lying - everything I say is a lie".  And the robot
collapses because it is not programmed to handle such blatant acts
of sabotage of reality.

Humans OTOH, and particular those who do odd jobs for the CIA (you
know, the ones who make those little "excursions" to Nepal and Burma),
have no problem with this, since their reality doesn't even intersect
with that of typical mailing list readers.

What is Tim May really mad about?  What he says he's mad about?
I don't think so.  The scam ran past him and he fell off of the
truck.  Tsk tsk.
