This would have another benefit.  More sophisticated tools exist for
filtering usenet than for filtering email in a voluntarily cooperative
way.  For example, I use a fairly extensive .procmailrc file to filter
my email, and blow away stuff that's either spam or a post from
someone I consider a blathering idiot.  There are some other folks on
the list who likely do the same thing, and there are some whose
.procmailrc files I'd like to see, and likely include in my own.  But
there's no easy way to do that.

With alt.cypherpunks, anyone who wishes to "help kill noise" could
simply issue a NoCeM report, and those of us with reasonable
newsreaders would be able to "listen" to the reports from people with
whom we want to cooperate.  And we can ignore the rest.  

The beauty of this scheme is that the control of the list is in the
hands of the individual reader, without requiring huge amounts of
redundant effort.

It's also occurred to me that there can be folks who NoCeM the NoCeM
reports :-)
