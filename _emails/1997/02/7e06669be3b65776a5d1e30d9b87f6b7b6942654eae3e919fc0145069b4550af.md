	I had understood the basic reasons for the double jeopardy
limit to be two: A. to prevent government from tormenting innocent
individuals with repeated trials; and B. to prevent convictions of
innocents by simple repeated trials until a jury made a mistake. The
latter can be analogized in statistics to the consideration that a
test with a p value of .05 will turn out false positive results 1 time in
20 by the nature of it; thus, if you look at two different studies/trials
with an independent (an oversimplifying assumption for trials, admittedly)
5% chance of an incorrect conviction, the chance is 1-((19/20)(19/20))
or 9.75% for _either_ of them turning out a false positive instead of a
5% chance. In a system partially based on the principle that it's better
to let the guilty go free than to punish the innocent, this result is
not acceptable. While the founding fathers probably didn't realize the
mathematics behind the second, I suspect that they had some intuition
of its nature.
	I can see an argument, however, for using it in the case of
state employees, particularly police - the state judicial/prosecutorial
system can hardly be said not to be biased in favor of them. A better
solution, however, would be to simply do the trial in a federal court
to begin with. (Having trials of federal employees in the courts of the
state of their alleged victims would be a correspondingly good idea,
although multiple possible states for this could be a problem.)
	I'd appreciate comments from persons with more legal knowledge
than I have; I am simply going by logic here.
	-Allen
