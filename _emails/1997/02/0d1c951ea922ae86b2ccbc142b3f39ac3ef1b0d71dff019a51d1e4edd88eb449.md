>GATES SAYS OLD LAWS ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE NET
>Microsoft's Bill Gates:  "It's always surprising how old concepts carry over

>is the one place where people should be able to do whatever they wish:
>present child pornography, do scams, libel people, steal copyrighted

	Looks like he hasn't thought about enforcement problems, which
may fortunately prevent the application of unnecessary laws to the 'net.

>CULTURE CLASHES ON THE INTERNET
>At a session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the issue of
>censorship on the Internet was debated from East/West perspectives, with the
>Eastern view represented by such countries as Singapore, Iran, and Egypt.
>Denmark foreign minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said, "Whenever you want to
>stop the free flow of information, you must ask yourself what is possible.
>The usual answer from politicians is we need international rules.  I say,
>forget it.  It won't happen."  Iranian mathematics professor Mohammed
>Lasijani countered:  "In the west, the issue is sometimes how to globalise
>liberalism:  how to export an ideology.  I am not a liberal, and I do not
>believe liberalism is the only way to a decent life."  (Financial Times 4

	Well, yes, neither did Adolf Hitler. Sorry, cultural differences
won't wash; individual liberties are more important than culture or
national sovreignty.
