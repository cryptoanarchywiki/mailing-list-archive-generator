I love working with girls, regardless of the job. I personally prefer
the ones who don't suck up to "the guys", and who don't subscribe to
what society prefers girls should do or look like.  Unfortunately,
most offices won't hire them unless they conform in ways that I feel
are offensive, so the really independent ones wind up mainly in low-
paying jobs or going it alone (i.e., driving a truck).

Nothing wrong with driving a truck, of course, but it would be nicer
still if they could co-exist alongside males in the majority of
workplaces without having to do female role-playing.
