Here is another idea.
The merchant and customer agree on a price, with the merchant knowing that
the "bank" will take a cut for their services.
The merchant and customer both LOG IN to the bank seperately, each type in
their agreed upon price and cut & paste in the services rendered
information.  If they match, the bank makes the necessary transaction
between the accounts, e-cash stash, etc.  The bank also supplies both
parties with a clear signed receipt.  The bank can now no longer alter the
receipt, as the merchant and customer both have a copy.  And the customer
and merchant can not alter the receipt, because then it would fail the test
on the signature.
If a receipt for a transaction number were used, then the only threat would
be the same one that exists for remailer operators.  This could be negated
by daisy-chaining banks in a similair manner.  If each bank took a cut of
non-customers of $.0002 or .02% of the transaction, whichever was greater,
then a suitable system could be set up.

Another idea that has been festering.  If we could get a CPA involved in
this forum, I would be willing to have h[im/er] sign my key, (which is
seldom used, mostly because this is the only place I use e-mail), for that
reasonable fee that CPA's can charge.  I know that it is not a standard, or
even legally recognized, post for CPA's, but I think that enough people
would trust them.
This would take care of some of the "newly minted" key problems.  Since
getting someone who is trusted to sign your key is a recognized method of
getting people to believe you are who you say you are.  Just an idea.
Actually two, one half thought out, one that has been bugging me.
