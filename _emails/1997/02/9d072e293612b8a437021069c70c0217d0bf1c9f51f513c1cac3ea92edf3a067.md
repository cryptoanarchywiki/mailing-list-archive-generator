	who should bear the burden of dealing with bounces?
	the list admin or the owner of the bouncing address?

	if you have the time and desire, you can accomodate people
that bounce mail due to a temporarily full mailbox.

	if not, unsubscribe them after N bounces in a 24 hour period.  
it becomes their responsibility not to bounce more than N emails.

	when a list has 1000's of subscribers, i have not have been able
to provide the type of personal service that the first option entails. 
i do make a digest version of every list available.  if the digest bounces,
the bouncer??? bouncee?? stays below the N bounces threshhold 
(for many values of N :).
