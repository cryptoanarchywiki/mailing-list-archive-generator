Both realistically and idealistically speaking, the peer relationships
should be up to each list operator.  

And, once again, both realistically and idealistically speaking, each
list operator should set their own policies.  The beauty of this 
scheme is that it gives maximum freedom to both the list operators 
*and* the list members -- if a list operator wants to filter out 
clever asci art, they can, and contrariwise, if the list members want 
to change list operators as a result, they can.  In fact, I don't see 
why moderated versions of the list couldn't happily coexist as part 
of the distributed list.  Let those flowers bloom!

BTW, I am planning on an upgrade to majordomo 1.94.1 this weekend, 
and I will be setting up cypherpunks@songbird.com at that time.
