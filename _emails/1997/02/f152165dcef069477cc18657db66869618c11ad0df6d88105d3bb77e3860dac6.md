I have to agree that Mr. Tim C May have a big point. Even if i didn't 
like all the things Mr. May wrote so could i read it, and that is the 
point i think Mr. Sandford missed. That is to have a list that is a 
"living" list. You have to have all the people giving their chanche 
to say what tehy like even if they dont are "mentaly healthy".I have 
one more thing to "say". Namely to say bye.bye. 
to this list. I have never posted to this list, i have only read it, 
because i like the freedom in it (free speech and so on), but if i 
have to change my subscription to unedit-cypherpunks just to "hear" 
the freedom of speech, i rather just say no and unsubscribe.
bye.bye
