You might want to set up a temporary majordomo on the same machine as one of
the permanent daemons for debugging purposes.  It is conceivable to me that
a message might be sent to one sub-list, be forewarded to two lists, and
then each of those foreward the same message to each other, causing duplication.
You might get around this if the daemons keep track of each others, unique,
message ID numbers.
In other words, if each unit were to apend the message ID with a personal ID
number when the message came from someone other than a majordomo, then they
could collate them by number, eliminate duplications, and send them on down
the line.
To do this, the majordomo daemons will probably have to have a guaranteed
seat in the front of the cue.
This is probably a stupid point to bring up as you have probably already
cured this problem, but I decided to post it anyway.
