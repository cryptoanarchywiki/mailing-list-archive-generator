I believe uti-Maco (a belgian company) has been using the Pijnenburg chips
for their boards. However, last I checked with them (about half a year ago)
the price of the boards was pretty steep -- of the order of $1K. 

Anyway, if the boards Peter is referring to are ready in the next couple 
of months, I volunteer to write drivers for Linux and *BSD*.
