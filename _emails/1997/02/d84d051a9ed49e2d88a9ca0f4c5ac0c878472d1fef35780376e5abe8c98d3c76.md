GSM is also a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system. In it's 
original form it uses specrum around 900 MHz, which I believe not to be 
available in the US. Shame really, I can roam with my GSM phone over 
pretty much the rest of the planet ... except the US.

Anyway, there are two higher frequency derivatives, PCS1800 & PCS1900, 
which have been deployed in the US. I'm not involved directly in the US 
market so I'm not sure where. I assume however that these are the 
systems to which Greg refers.

Aww shame ;)

GSM uses the A5 algorithm which *is* cryptographically strong, but is 
unfortunately considered to be top secret stuff. If, however, you were 
to pick up a copy of "Applied Cryptography, 2nd Edition" by Bruce 
Schneier you may find something of interest.

I hope that you'll work out from my .sig why I can't say much more.

Hope this helps
