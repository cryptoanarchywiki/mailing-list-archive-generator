Hi Cypherpunks.  Long time no lurk.  Too busy defending the right to own 
unregistered guns and getting involved in local politics to dwell on the 
shortfalls of OS/2 PGP shells for PM GUI.  PGP apps for OS/2 sucks!

Anyhow, if you have any comments on the forwarded message, please Cc me.
Is there a limit to spamming?  Is there a way to attach nitroglycerine to an 
e-mail reply? ( I know Jim Bell has a few suggestions about that... :-)

Ciao all

JFA
