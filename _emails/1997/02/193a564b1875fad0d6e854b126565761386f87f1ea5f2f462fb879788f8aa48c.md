  How long are you and your bum-buddies at C2Nut going to continue to
try to denigrate god-and-everybody by making out-of-context links to
Dr. Vulis? Is Senator McCarthy alive and well at C2Nut?

  Whining? Suggestions?
  I'm 'flaming' shit-for-brains, and I'm working from the fact sheets.
  Fact: Sammy's pecker-tracks are all over the attempted takeover of
the CypherPunks list.
  Fact: John Gilmore turned over control of the CypherPunks list at 
toad.com to C2Nut employee Sandy Sandfort, under the pretext of 
cutting down on mailbomb attacks.
  Fact: List subscribers were forcibly relocated to a list Censored
by C2Nut employee Sandy Sandfort.
  Fact: C2Nut employee Sandy Sandfort then proceeded to Censor the
posts to the CypherPunks list in an attempt to blunt criticism of
the takeover of the list.
  Fact: C2Nut employee Sandy Sandfort announced that his Censorship
of the CypherPunks list was not based on cryptographical content.
  Fact: Sandy Sandfort approved posts to the Censored list that insulted
those who criticized him, while deleting the posts of those who
responded
to those insults.
  Fact: C2Nut employee Sandy Sandfort deleted incoming CypherPunks 
posts directly, sending them to none of the lists, if they reflected
poorly on his employer, fellow employees, and his supporters.
  Fact: Under C2Nut employee Sandy Sandfort's list dictatorship, many
of the so-called 'Evil Dr. Vulis ASCII' spams originated directly 
from toad.com, with forged headers. Others originated from the ISP's
of C2Net employees.
  Fact: C2Nut's Sameer controls cypherpunks.com on the WWW.
  Fact: C2Nut stands to profit from having control of the CypherPunks
name.
  Fact: C2Nut's employees were, and are, working in conjunction with 
others who have major financial interests that will benefit from control 
of the CypherPunks reputation capital.
  Fact: C2Nut and their employees apply threats of legal attack, both
directly and indirectly, to those whose words conflict with the goals
of C2Nut and their web of associated interests.
  Fact: If C2Nut wants the hidden agendas of themselves and their
associates to remain hidden, then they need better firewalls in place.

  Better to have Scotch in my mouth than my employer's sperm. And I 
doubt whether your butt is much of a challenge.
