No, you're taking the issue to ridiculous extremes.    That's why we have 
doors, and locks, etc.  And, for that matter, "No trespassing" signs.  


But having an address, and a walkway, and a doorbell is generally considered 
if not explicit permission, but at least toleration of the idea that 
somebody can walk up and knock on the door, etc.  Having a telephone with a 
number that anyone can dial is going to result in some level of intrusion.  
Having a fax machine is a similar issue, unless technology provides a way to 
block unwanted faxes.

I certainly don't claim that we shouldn't try to do anything about these 
limitations!  Quite the opposite, technology should be employed to protect 
privacy.  But faxes are not fundamentally different than telephones, 
doorbells, and walkways:  They facilitate interaction, even potentially 
undesirable interaction.

"Legal" is an arbirary concept; the opposite, "illegal," is merely what some 
bunch of brainless legislators get together and disapprove.
