I noticed that there are several programs that will let anyone send encrypted
email.

What about encrypted messages over a chat system like irc, chat rooms(aol,
BBS) and systemwide messages (IM, whisper, private message)?

The server wouldn't have to do anything except send the messages, the users
software could handel all the protocols and message identification.  Dialup
and logon features aren't needed either, allmost all cilents will let you
shell.

I have been looking for, and tring to write a program to do this, but Im a
rookie programmer and my attempts have yet to produce a functional
send/receive utility.

Where are programs like this.. are there any to be found?
