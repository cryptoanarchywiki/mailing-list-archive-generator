Comments From:	Steve Schear  (in response to Vladimir Nuri-logical)

all, or certainly
increased, funding in order to hasten its [govmt] collapse.

Very pertinent suggestions.  Anyone who knows his history on the list
knows how Nuri-logical looks forward to the collapse of governments and
is especially fond of reading Tocqueville.
