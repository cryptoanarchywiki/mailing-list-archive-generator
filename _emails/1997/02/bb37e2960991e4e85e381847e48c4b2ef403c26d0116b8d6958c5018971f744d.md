It seems as though it's a keyring(!) with one (some?) of the/those
key(s) they use to unlock all the mailboxes for apartment houses.
I guess it's a keyring too big for a pocket, but I don't know.

Herald reporter revealed this today, but didn't want to. I guessed
right, and he ended up admitting it after I informed him of how I
know various Herald reporters and sorta social engineered him into
saying too much by keeping him talking. :-)

My mail has been acting up all weekend due to something unknown
happening at Sprint.

One of the "legitimate concerns of law enforcement" seems to be
that I was born innocent until proven guilty and not the other
way around. -- me
