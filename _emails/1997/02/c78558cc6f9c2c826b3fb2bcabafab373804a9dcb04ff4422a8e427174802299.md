All sniffers have to write to disk at some point.  You can detect one by 
checking to see how much disk space you have (DIR on MSDOS), typing a few 
lines of random characters, and check your disk space again.  If it's 
gone down a little, then you probably have one.

Try checking in your TEMP directory...the few ones that I've seen default 
to creating an invisible file in that directory.

They either buy them or write them.

If you need to know how to set up a mail filter or defend against 
emailbombs, send me a message with the words "get helpfile" (without the 
" marks) in the SUBJECT: header, *NOT THE BODY OF THE MESSAGE!*  I have 
several useful FAQs and documents available.
