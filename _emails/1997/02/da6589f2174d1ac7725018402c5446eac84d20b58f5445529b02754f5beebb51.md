Chech out the cannonical passphrase FAQ:
http://www.stack.nl/~galactus/remailers/passphrase-faq.html

This one has some quick reminders of what to do and not to do
http://www.encryption.com/pphrase.htm

Bottom line, totally random ASCII will have lots of bits per
character, but english has about 1.2 bits per character. Misspellings
can add to that, depending on the extent of mutillation . Combining
certain words can make your passphrase weaker (such as "To be or not
to be," "This is my passphrase," etc.).

HTH,
