I'm sorry to flame, but I'm getting sick of this.

I don't want to sign a formal contract.  I want to break the key.  I
don't care about the money.  I can buy a lottery ticket if I want a
small chance at winning a lot of money.

I'll participate when I can download something, type make, run it, and
forget about it.

Invoving money money seems to be making it harder, not easier, to do
this.  I thought the reason to crack the key was to demonstrate how
weak DES is.  If the person who cracks the key collects the reward
himself, so what?  A good, public nail in the coffin of restrictions
on crypto is worth the risk that someone steals the $10k, IMHO.

I've got my idle cycles waiting....
