I would like to point out two items:

1. A US ban on domestic sales of secure telephony products will require an
act of Congress.

2. Insiders have known for months that the US Department of Justice is
planning to introduce crypto legislation during the current session of
Congress.

You draw your own conclusions. IMHO, we will see the USG approaching
Congress, pointing to the multilateral agreement, and ask that Congress
pass a law to implement the agreement (which, let us not forget about it,
has of course been instigated by the USG).

It just might work.
