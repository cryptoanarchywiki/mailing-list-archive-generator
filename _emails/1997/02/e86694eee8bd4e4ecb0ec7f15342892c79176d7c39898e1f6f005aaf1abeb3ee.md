I'm really sick and tired of this hypocritical bullshit from our
executive branch.  On one hand, we have FBI + CIA + NSA crying
terrorists and child pornographers can get away with their crimes if
networks are secured with cryptography.  On the other hand, we also
have presidential panels crying that our networks are vulnerable to
terrorists if we don't do some serious security overhauls.

What the *#@!! do they want?  If you outlaw security software, then
stop whining that the networks aren't secure!  If you want secure
networks, stop whining about the encryption "problem".

Either the network is secure or it isn't.

YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS!

 the threat.
