I've noticed the same thing, and this is part of why I'm so skeptical of
the "many majordomos" notion. Some of the proponents have their own notions
of who is fit to be in their system, and which topics are appropriate.

If alt.cypherpunks gets wide propagation, I expect that'll be where I post
the bulk of my stuff.

By the way, several people have stepped forward to offer to host "the list"
(?) on their Linux boxes, or spare CPU cycles they have somewhere. It's
important that such offers be weighed carefully in terms of how serious the
commitment is, and how long the service might last.

where a remailer went down because "I took my laptop with me on vacation to
Spain.")

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
