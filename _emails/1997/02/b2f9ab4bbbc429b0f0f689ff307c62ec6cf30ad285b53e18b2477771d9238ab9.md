That was just -bullshit-  There is no legal liability whatsoever
to the moderating of any mailing list.  All Sandy did was make an
excuse to be a censor.

The whole machine is broken, so throw it away.

Yes, and just why is Gilmore such a jerk?  Could his homosexuality
have anything to do with it?

Good.  You are a bad example of todays modern CyberNaut Netizen, and 
queers like you should go away, so we can clean up this InterNet and
make it a good place for straight people.

Maybe they just wanted you to leave, Gilmore.  After all, your EFF has
ruined the reputation of the InterNet, and your homosexuality is a bad
sign.  Homos should not be allowed to have any authority positions
anyplace on the net.

Let us hope that the whole EFF goes down the drain with him.

This all goes to usenet as mail.cypherpunks, you know.

Zappa is irrelevant here.  And stop trying to sell censorship as

You can start any new list you want at cypherpunks@pgh.org

They will provide a free address and majordomo location.
And the mail.cypherpunks newsgroup shall suffice for now.

You leaving is no big thing, dude.

No, I will fix up a new address where Dimitri or anyone can run the

Sandy is not a very smart Lawyer, and he is only using that as an
excuse to censor.

Face it John Gilmore, you are a known queer and queers are not
allowed to have any authority positions any more, because they
are the ones who have aggregated and ruined the InterNet so far.
Queers are too unstable and untrustworthy, as has been shown again in
this instance.

Just get rid of John Golmore, and that will be the first step in the
right direction.  The entire EFF is a BAD agency and it gives a bad
reputation to the rest of us good Organizations.
