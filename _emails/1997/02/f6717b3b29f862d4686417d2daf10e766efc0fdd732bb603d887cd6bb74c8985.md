I'm arguing against two things:

1. The basic notion of centralized moderation, with the name "Cypherpunks"
now closely associated with a Big Brotherish, "we know what's better for
you than you do" sort of censorship.

2. The apparently careless and inconsistent way Sandy is censoring posts.
As others have also noted, non-flamish posts are being sent to the Flames
list. A censor who will not take the time to read the list traffic on a
continuing basis, e.g., by spending the several hours a day on it that many
of us spend (or used to spend), is not suited to be a censor. I suggested
at the time of his self-appointment to the role of Censor that Sandy would
not devote the needed time to this task. (Not that this makes censorship
OK, mind you.)

I'm not defending Vulis per se, and I continue to think Vulis is a twit.
But one of the goals Vulis apparently set out to accomplish (just as you
did a couple of years ago, Larry) was to force the list to start censoring
itself, even to force the list to shut down.

It seems likely that Vulis is quite happy with the outcome here.

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
