This is the index :

Electronic money: toward a virtual wallet
By Tekla S. Perry
Hard currency is disappearing from many everyday transactions along the
road to electronic money.

Future of electronic money: a regulator's perspective
By Edward W. Kelley Jr.
The way electronics will fit into the evolution of money--from acting as a
niche player
to wreaking major changes in payment systems--has yet to be determined.

Credits and debits on the Internet
By Marvin A. Sirbu
CyberCash, First Virtual, GC Tech, NetBill--these and other systems have
been developed to enable electronic transfers of payments across the
Internet.

'Minting' electronic cash
By David Chaum & Stefan Brands
Electronic cash can offer transaction privacy to honest users, affords
convenient storage and transportation, and protects against loss.

Traceable e-cash
By Peter S. Gemmell
One method of making electronic cash transactions private for honest users but
traceable by law enforcement agencies involves the use of trustees.

Crime and prevention: a Treasury viewpoint
By Stanley E. Morris
The speed and anonymity of electronic payment systems make them attractive
to those pursuing illicit activities.

Locking the e-safe
By Robert W. Baldwin & C. Victor Chang
Existing encryption-based security mechanisms can be combined to minimize a
wide range of threats to electronic commerce.

In your pocket: smartcards
By Carol Hovenga Fancher
A wallet full of cash, credit, and identification cards may, in the future,
be replaced
with two or three smartcards, each containing an IC, as a recent flurry of
market
tests and smartcard rollouts demonstrates.

Banking in cyberspace: an investment in itself
By Michael C. McChesney
While home banking has been around for some time, Internet banking is a new
concept, and has a number of advantages.

Technology takes to securities trading
By Steven M. H. Wallman
>From stock offerings conducted entirely over the Internet, to the
automation of traditional exchanges, technology is changing the way stock
markets work.

Nasdaq's technology floor: its president takes stock
By Alfred R. Berkeley III
This screen-based stock market has been particularly sensitive to the
effects of new
computer and communications capabilities.

The economics of e-cash
By Mike Ter Maat
Electronic cash can create profits for its issuers, and launch competition
for today's
government-controlled currency systems.

Money and the Internet: a strange new relationship
By Howard Anderson
This visionary sees the e-money revolution as inevitable, with "e-mail for
money"
becoming as ubiquitous in the future as e-mail messages are already today.
