Oh No!  First they told us that they were all in favor of a cashless society
because they could track all the transactions.  It was their Orwellian
Dream.  Now Nirvana has almost arrived and they're afraid of it.  Can't
they make up their minds?

I noticed the problem long about 1975 when I noticed that the spread of
ATM cards was actually the spread of a bearer instrument and would
not satisfy the control needs of the regulatory types.
