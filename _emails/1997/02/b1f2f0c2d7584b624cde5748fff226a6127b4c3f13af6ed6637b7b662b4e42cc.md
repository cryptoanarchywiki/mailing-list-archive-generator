Does anyone have a list of web proxies for anonymous surfing?

I already know about www.anonymizer.com, and there was a
"canadianizer" that would alter text to make it more "Canadian",
but that is now apparently defunct.

Reason I need to know, a friend in a foreign country has to deal
with a web proxy that blocks "objectionable" sites including
www.anonymizer, so some alternates that might not be blocked
would be welcome.
