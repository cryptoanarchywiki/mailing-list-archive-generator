  i can confirm this.  i recently talked to an employee of a firm [who
i won't name] that was looking for some kind of shrouding scheme to protect
their copy-protection enforcement code, under W95.  [he knows the effort
is ultimately doomed.  he *is* a user of SoftICE, after all... :-) ]

  quotable quotes:

  "we know someone's going to have their scheme cracked.  all we care
   about is that ours isn't the first."

  "i can't tell you the [encryption] algorithm, because that would let
   you break it.  yes, the security is in the algorithm."


  where does hollywood get its crypto?  mattel?
