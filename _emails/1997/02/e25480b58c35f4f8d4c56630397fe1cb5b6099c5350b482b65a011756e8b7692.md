Patrick reminds us of why a simple name like "alt.cypherpunks" is
preferable to an extensive hierarchy: "I can't remember the names of the
subgroups."

It was a mistake, I believe, to create the various subgroups, and I hope
they fail to propagate.

I'd rather use more capable newsreading tools to scan _one_ group and
follow interesting threads in it than try to remember what got posted
where. And I especially don't want to see the predictable carping about how
some topic "belongs" in one of the other groups!

And many will simply cross-post their stuff to more than one of the groups,
trying to guess which are most relevant, which are being read by enough
people, etc.

Even at a hundred messages a day, a single group is easily managed. And
having four of them will not cut the traffic in the main group
significantly.
