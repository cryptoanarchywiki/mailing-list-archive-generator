hi,

i came in today to find they (university system admins) had pulled the
plug on my machine.  this is all because some luser spammed usenet
using the remailer on my machine.  thanks a lot.

so, the lead remailer is gone for good; it lasted almost exactly one
year. 

it was nice while it lasted.
