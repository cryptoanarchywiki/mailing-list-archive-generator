My script preserves the Message-ID, assuming that the incoming message
has one.  Other gateways I've seen also appear to preserve Message-ID
lines (or at least messages posted through them appear to have
mail-like ID lines).

Not immediately sending a message back to the host that it came from
does look like a good idea (it came from foo.com, so foo.com obviously
has it).  Filtering out other gateways' messages will reduce load at
the possible expense of delay (assuming a smallish network of news
servers that feed each other the list; obviously the message will
flood the majordomo net before it floods the real usenet unless
something is seriously broken).

I didn't exactly say, but I was comparing a small network of news
servers feeding each other cypherpunks.list to, say,
alt.cypherpunks.list.

I'm trying to come up with a way to provide NNTP access (and an
experimental alternative to the net-of-majordomos) that won't offend
anybody too much.  I can filter out messages that the authors don't
want sent out; I'd prefer to deal with what would make the authors
want the messages filtered out instead.

Yes.  Should have read:

It doesn't seem an especially bad idea to send a gateway multiple
copies of the same message, since theextra messages won't increase the
load much but will increase the reliability and decrease the
propagation time compared to a network where there are no duplicates.
The only case where filtering duplicates is certain not to hurt delay
or reliability is when the gateway in question is known to have a copy
of the message already.  Usenet uses the Path header for this; there
doesn't seem to be such a thing in the majordomo net.

The main way to get a message rejected seems to be using obsolete
news headers on it.  If you don't want your message posted, add a
Posting-Version line to the header.

No more so than a sufficiently bad news posting that came in over NNTP
(since the mails do turn into news postings over NNTP).
