Hee... I think they're both just after money.

Well, of course. AlterNIC does charge a few bucks for registering in
some of their TLDs.  I'm not sure about the other alternative-name
servers, but somehow I doubt it's a charity program.  And of course
we all know about InterNIC's cash cow...

[the proposed new TLDs]
.firm  
.store  Somehow, these two look rather similar to me.

.web    Actually a good idea :) A lot of the .com congestion is
        from companies that are virtually-hosted for the sole
        purpose of running a Web site with the www. prefix.

.arts   
.rec
.info   How many of these would fit into the .org (or even .us) domains?

.nom    Nah. Just not classy enough.  Now, a .nym TLD... :-)

How so?  AlterNIC et al. aren't exactly globally recognized anyway.
If we're going to have more TLDs, it's at least less "bad" to have them
coming from the place where names have been coming from anyway (InterNIC).
No matter what, it'll be a long time before _any_ new TLDs are
universally recognized, just because somewhere, someone's sysadmin
is asleep at the wheel.  (Probably at my ISP :)
