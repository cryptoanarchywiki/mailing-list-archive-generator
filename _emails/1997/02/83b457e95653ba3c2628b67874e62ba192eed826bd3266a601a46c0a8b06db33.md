Ed Felten has an article in RISKS Digest, Volume 18, Issue 83,
http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/18.83.html
called "Myths about digital signatures".  It's focused on the 
	"Microsoft Signed This ActiveX Applet So It Must Be Safe"
delusion.  Nothing we haven't heard before, but a good summary.

He's also announcing a mailing list on security of Java/ActiveX/etc.
