THE CLAIM:
> Our "anonymizer" service allows you to surf the web without
> revealing any personal information.

THE PROBLEM:
> If you access The Anonymizer through a proxy server, it may add a 
> variable, such as "HTTP_FORWARDED", that The Anonymizer does not filter 
> out, revealing your true identity.

THE DATA:
> Below is a printout of the variables from an "anonymous" session done 
> through The Anonymizer when accessed through the Squid proxy server.

REMOTE_HOST=darkmatter.infonex.com
REMOTE_ADDR=206.170.114.24
HTTP_USER_AGENT=Mozilla/3.01 (via THE ANONYMIZER!)
HTTP_HOST=sol.infonex.com:8080
HTTP_FORWARDED=by http://galaxy.galstar.com:3128/ (Squid/1.0.20) for 204.251.83.41
HTTP_PRAGMA=no-cache
HTTP_PROXY_CONNECTION=Keep-Alive

THE RESULT:
> A CGI script could see that you were using The Anonymizer to hide 
> yourself, but your true IP address is revealed in the "HTTP_FORWARDED" 
> string.

THE SUMMARY:
> Beware using an anonymous browsing service if you are going through a 
> proxy server. Until they remove the information provided by proxy 
> servers, using their service isn't as anonymous as they say.

THE QUOTE:
> (from The Anonymizer home page) "Many people surf the web under the
> illusion that their actions are private and anonymous. Unfortunately, it
> isn't so."
