Hi folks,

I am looking for more info on the ongoing House Science subcommittee
which is about computer technology and national security. I heard they
have folks talking about encryption and why it's important to use
technology and not legislation to protect people's privacy...

Theres a short article in the nando.net paper today about this 
committee at URL:
