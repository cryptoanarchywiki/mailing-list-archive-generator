o Make the list a newsgroup "alt.cypherpunks". This will alleviate any
concerns about one party taking control of the list. Good filters exist and
the newsgroup can be read via Deja News, etc.

o For those using remailers or those unable to post to newsgroups, create a
mail-to-news gateway at cypherpunks@toad.com.

OK, how will take the fist step and newsgroup alt.cypherpunks?
