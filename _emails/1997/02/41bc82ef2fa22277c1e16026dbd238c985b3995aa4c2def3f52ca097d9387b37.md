  Is this a follow-up to your suggestion to kill the list?
  The list that you stated you were leaving because you don't
think it's worthy of subscribing to?
  Is there any particular reason you want to redirect the future
of a list that you want killed and no longer want to subscribe to?

  Just asking.

Trust Me (<--shouldn't this be 'your' sig?)
