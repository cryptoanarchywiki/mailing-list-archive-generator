I checked with the people at College Hill Internet by forwarding your 
msg to them to which they replied.

**N.B. - College Hill did my page so I know them to be reputable.

Long story short, they worked on a web page for a particular political 
campaign and, during the process of doing the web consulting, they  
briefly set up an e-mail account for them on their server.

Since then, they have been treated to a regular supply of spam from 
various persons who think that is still the Senator's address.  They've 
received threatening spam (about 200 hundred copies of it) which was 
bounced from them back to senders who in this case weren't even the 
senders, etc. etc. etc.

The headers reflect that they've been forged.  Understandably, College 
Hill is concerned that, those people who might not understand the 
headers that well, will conclude College Hill as being the spammers - 
which could damage their reputation.

Hope this answers (at least part of) your question.

Lynne
