	Umm... there's a difference. Moderation is control by a _person_;
not moving to Usenet is control by nobody except how things happen to be set
up.

	Hmm... since both you and Bill Stewart are pointing out various
advantageous things about Usenet, I may need to retract my previous statement
that mail fitering is better. On the other hand, other people have mentioned
the susceptibility of email to write-your-own filtering and other
processing. (For instance, I've got a project that needs cypherpunks (and
other controversial groups) to be on mailing lists instead of (or at least
as well as) news servers to work right.) Is there a full-scale equivalent
of procmail for Usenet, including functions like shunting messages to
programs et al?

	Quite.
