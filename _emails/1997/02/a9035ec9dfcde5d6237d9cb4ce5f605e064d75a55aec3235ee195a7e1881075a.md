I've just had mail from Carlisle Adams in response to my question about the 
status of CAST-128:
 
>CAST-128 is available free for commercial and non-commercial use.  This
>has been stated publicly in a press release from Entrust Technologies
>(see http://www.entrust.com/press.htm for details).  The cipher
>itself is described in complete detail, along with test vectors, etc.,
>at the same web site (see the "Technical Papers" section of
>http://www.entrust.com/library.htm).

>Feel free to post this response wherever you think it appropriate.

The algorithm is well worth looking at (see the URL above) - it's a nice 
royalty-free drop-in replacement for IDEA for example.  I've had a version 
half-finished for inclusion in cryptlib for a few months now, but something 
else always seems to crop up...
 
Peter.
