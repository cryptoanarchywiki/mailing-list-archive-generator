I notice several posts to the list discussing the incident when a 
message was sent to the list and was only at toad.com for 3 seconds 
before being forwarded. This incident, as the other posts observed, 
seems to suggest some kind of keyword filtering based on content or 
poster identity is in place. Sandy, can you explain this incident 
along with the fact that the post Dimitri sent about stronghold was 
sent to neither of the "filtered" lists.
