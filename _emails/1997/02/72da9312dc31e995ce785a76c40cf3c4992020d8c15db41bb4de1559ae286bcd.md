	The basic difficulty with this idea is that _senders_ generally
don't have much of a choice where the messages go, once you've decided
to accept them. In other words, just because you've decided to accept
a message doesn't mean it suddenly becomes
copyleft/public domain/whatever. Now, if you, say, announced that only
subscribers to your particular list, subscribers to any other lists
adopting the same idea, and those who'd sign a consent agreement could
post through your list, that wouldn't be a problem... although I
suspect you wouldn't get many subscribers.
