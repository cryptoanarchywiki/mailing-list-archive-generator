I_Love_SPAM,

Hello!

If you are in any Network Marketing program ask yourself 
this question...

WHY? Would you want to build a downline in just ONE
program and receive just ONE check?  When you could 
receive up to 20 CHECKS A MONTH with no more effort 
than just building a single downline!  

Because it's the smart thing to do!!! 

When you are ready to embark on this lucrative 
opportunity go sign up at 
http://members.tripod.com/~brianj/index.html
for a FREE web site to start building your downline.
