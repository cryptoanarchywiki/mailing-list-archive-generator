My uncle says that sometimes (your last sentence). Maybe he got it from you?
He keeps your messages in a dir called NotADork. This is the one he keeps 
track the size of by bytes. He says that he keeps track of the size of his
Dorks dir by wieghing it on the bathroom scale.
(This is a compliment5 to you.)

I don't. I let _lamer_ be my watchword...
Everyones a lamer, sometimes. A "real lamer" is a lamer all the time.
Cypherpunks have some guys who talk real intelligent with a lot of words but
when you read it all, you can tell that their full-time lamers instead
of just ocassional ones.
Your hardly ever a lamer.
