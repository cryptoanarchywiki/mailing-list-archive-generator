The current subscription is between 1,000 and 2,000 I don't think that is
_lots_. All we need to do is count the number of bounces per address in
a given period, the SSZ end is trying to decide between weekly or
monthly cleanings, and then clear that address. At no point would I need
to archive the original bounce.

I certainly hope they get a cpunks address made available. I will certainly
subscribe cpunks@ssz so that the distributed remailer will benefit from 
that input. However, one of the major realizations is that as long as one
anything is involved in the list it is capable of being shutdown at any
time with no warning. It also makes it much easier to compromise. I would
like to see servers in several countries myself.
