But which "criminals," exactly, are "increasingly using encryption to 
conceal their plans and activities"?  Let's not concede this unless it's 
really true.

It would be far more accurate to say that it's likely that many people who 
are politically hostile to their government are using encryption in 
anticipation of persecution by the government, persecution that could easily 
come in the form of criminal charges.
