Ok...this is the fourth junk e-mail I've received that I don't want.  Your
account is in jeapordy, and my advice is for you to just stop sending me
this junk.  Take me off your e-mail list, NOW.  
If this e-mail from me, being mad at you, is what makes you happy, and is
how you have fun, then you just have a personal problem and I feel sorry
for you.  
Do what you can to heal yourself...meanwhile, don't send me anymore...your
isp provider is next on my e-mail list.
