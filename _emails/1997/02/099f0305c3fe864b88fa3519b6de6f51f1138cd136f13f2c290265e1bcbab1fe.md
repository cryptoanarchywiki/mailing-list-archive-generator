There are a variety of approaches being pursued in parallel.
You can subscribe to cypherpunks@Cyberpass.net by sending
mail to majordomo@Cyberpass.net with the usual syntax (send it a 
message body of "help" if you want details.)  It should gateway to
the other mail servers as they develop.  It's currently getting 
everything from cypherpunks@toad.com, which I've no unsubscribed to
to avoid getting duplicate copies of everything.

If you're one of those people getting one or more copies of the
cypherpunks mailing list and you don't want to, find out where your
mail is coming from and send mail to majordomo there....
