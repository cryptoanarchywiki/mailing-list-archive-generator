Well I have looked at SSLeay, and Ben Laurie's apache-SSL module which
is what StrongHold is based on, but not in any great detail, so I
shouldn't comment one way or another.

If you are suggesting there is a flaw, perhaps you could give some
hints on what the alleged flaw is, so that I could stand a chance of
refuting or confirming your claim, and so that if there is a flaw, it
can be fixed?

I, and I think many others, took your claim to be a PSYOP attempt to
cause a dilemma for Sandy.  If you really did find a flaw, well, lets
here it.  C2Net would owe you an apology.
