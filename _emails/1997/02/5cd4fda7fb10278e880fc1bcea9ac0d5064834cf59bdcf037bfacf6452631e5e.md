The Digital / Microsoft "Driving Force" tour is in our parking lot today
and I got the opportunity to have a look around.  One of the 'stations'
inside the truck is on intranets.  They were showing off a product called
"AltaVista Tunnel" which I assume is their PPTP product.  I say "I assume"
because the guy showing it off had absolutely no clue what he was talking
about.  He triumphantly exclaimed that the encryption was 128-bit, but when
I said "128-bit what?" he cowered and muttered that he didn't know and went
on with his little speech.  The rest of my crypto-specific questions met
with equal dark stares.  And these are the people setting industry standards...

Real programmers programs never work right the first time. But if you
throw them on the machine they can be patched into working in only a few
30-hours debugging sessions.
