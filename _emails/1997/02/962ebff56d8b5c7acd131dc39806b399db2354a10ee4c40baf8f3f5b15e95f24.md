[Fluffy Gilmore apologia by Declan expunged]

Two small points.

1.  The rift between Gilmore/EFF and Cypherpunks is hardly
    of recent origin, and dates back to when the EFF first
    demonstrated to horrified Cypherpunks that its policy
    would be one of appeasement and capitulation towards
    clearly unacceptable legislation.  This is all in the
    archives, including Tim May's essay on why he chose not
    to renew his EFF membership.

2.  The article fails to mention Gilmore's new nickname. :)
