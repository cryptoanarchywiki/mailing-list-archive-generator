   I hope you misspelled "news server." alt.cypherpunks (and subgroups)
   is a newsgroup.

   You should join one of the distributed mailing lists (choose the list
   admin you like/trust the most). There is supposed to be a gateway
   between the mailing list and the newsgroup, but it is not up yet.

   Here's the overview:
   cypherpunks@toad.com is going away. In its place is a distributed
   forum. This forum is currently made up of a network of mailing lists,
   which send all their messages to each other. In the future, the
   newsgroup alt.cypherpunks will be added to this network (posts to the
   newsgroup go to the mailing lists, mail to the lists goes to the
   newsgroup). The mailing lists will be faster than the newsgroup, the
   newsgroup will probably let you use better filtering tools. Your
   choice.

   HTH,
   Jer
