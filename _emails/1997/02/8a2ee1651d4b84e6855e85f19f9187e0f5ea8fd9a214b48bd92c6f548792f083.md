Minnesota Legislature has a bill pending in both houses regarding
digital signatures, defines certification authorities, and provides
for licensing of authorities.

A quick read looks good, although I am not a lawyer. This only affects
digital signatures used in financial transactions, AFAIK, and does
not prohibit non-licensed cert authorities.
