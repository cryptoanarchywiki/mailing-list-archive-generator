We've put the full 50USC Chapter 35 -- International
Emergency Economic Powers at:

   http://jya.com/50usc35.txt  (284K)

Section 1701 is the great bulk of it, and describes
the purpose of emergency economic power. And
lists the current enemies -- rogue nations and 
terrorists -- used, as were predecessors, to justify 
its never-ending renewal.
