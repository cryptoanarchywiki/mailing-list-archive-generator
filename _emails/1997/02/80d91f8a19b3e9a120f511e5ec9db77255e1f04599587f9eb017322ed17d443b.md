 A discussion draft of the MA Electronic Records and Signatures Act is now
 available on the web at http://www.magnet.state.ma.us/itd/legal/mersa.htm.

 The draft appears to be very preliminary--entire sections are marked
 [under development].

 It is notable for its brevity, especially compared to the Utah Statute.
 Noticeably absent is any language dealing with  licensure of certification
 authorities (bravo!).

 A link is provided for submission of public comments to Ray Campbell and
 Dan Greenwood.
