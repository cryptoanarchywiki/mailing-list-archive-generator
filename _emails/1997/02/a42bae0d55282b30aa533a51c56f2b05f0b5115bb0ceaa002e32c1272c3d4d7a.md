3.5.1 Contrary to what people sometimes claim, there is no ruling
       clique of Cypherpunks. Anybody is free to do nearly anything,
       just not free to commit others to course of action, or claim
       to speak for the "Cypherpunks" as a group (and this last
       point is unenforceable except through reputation and social
       repercussions).

3.6.3 "Why isn't the list moderated?"
      ...hardly consistent with many of our anarchist leanings, is
          it?
      - "No, please, let's not become a 'moderated' newsgroup. This
      would be the end of freedom!
