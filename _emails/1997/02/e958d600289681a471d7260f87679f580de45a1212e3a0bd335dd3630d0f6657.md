There are some things that just go off in my mind like a light bulb
coming on, and the realization that the system would take care of
itself was one of those things.

There is also a great deal of disinformation in the system, which
leads to a misperception on the public's part about just what those
biases might be.

Examples that come to mind are the OKC bombing and the OJ murders.
In both cases, grand juries composed of middle class people (all or
almost all White in the Simpson case) would not indict based on the
evidence they were given, and so they were dissolved and an excuse
was made up to cover someone's butt.  Now some of the fallout is
blowing in in the form of revelations about the FBI crime lab.

I don't see any reason why we can't develop programs to do certain
levels of preliminary analysis in these cases, much like the programs
which have been around for years on PC's, i.e., Mind Prober, Decision
Analyst, and so on.  I gotta believe that teams of people who prepare
these cases are using this stuff anyway, albeit discretely.  If it's
brought out into the open, and the public can look at case facts that
have been processed thru multiple software sites, it would have to be
a helluva lot better than Joe Schmucko's byline in the L.A. Times,
for example.
