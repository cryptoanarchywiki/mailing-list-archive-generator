+Hi!  The following headers are from a posting by John Young that looks
+like it was sent to cypherpunks@toad.com,
+forwarded to cypherpunks@sirius.infonex.com and/or
+cypherpunks@cyberpass.net, and has the Reply-To: header
+set to reply to cypherpunks@toad.com instead of to John Young.... It
+looks like the obvious implementation of cypherpunks-style mail header
+patching, but isn't quite right.....  Leads to people sending their
+John Young mailbot requests to cypherpunks@toad.com instead, as some
+well-known cypherpunks have mistakenly done recently :-)

    this is what Lance said he would do...  until toad.com shuts down, 
    you address all messages to cypherpunks@toad.com to avoid overlap.
    toad.com was never set up to show cypherpunks@road.com in the 
    "Reply-To: " field, but it should have been.

    mailing lists then have the "From: " field from the original sender,
    and the "Reply-To: " to the list.  Now, there are reasons some list
    operators do not change the reply field --usually in the hope any
    responders will not notice the list is not being copied....in just 
    turns into private mail.

    for the almost 20 years I been playing with mail lists of various 
    sorts starting with simple inbound scoop and explode to list, 
    Lance's convention has been the norm.

        attila gone...
