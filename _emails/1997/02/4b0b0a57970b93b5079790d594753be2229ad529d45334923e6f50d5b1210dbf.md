I was at the airport, checking in at the gate. An airport employee
asked me (and I quote)

 "Has anyone put anything in your baggage without your knowledge?"

I thought about it. I scratched my goatee. I said:

 "If it was without *my* knowledge... how would *I* know about it?"

He smiled. He nodded his head, knowingly. He then gave me this cryptic
reply,

 "That's why we ask."
