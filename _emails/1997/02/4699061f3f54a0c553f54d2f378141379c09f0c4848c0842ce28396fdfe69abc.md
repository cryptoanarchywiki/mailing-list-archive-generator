AB> My main complaints about the `filtering' service forced upon the list

AB> 1. It was done to the main list!  If cypherpunks were left unchanged,

  As a lurker (I've only sent 4 messages to the list in the last 3 years),
I agree completely with Adam Back's post.

  I'd also like to point out, that I rarely read all of the messages, and
tend to select which messages to read, based on the subject.  Because of
this, I missed the message announcing that the moderation had started, 
and that there was a new, unedited list.  I didn't realize the moderation
had started, until I noticed the lack of autobot insults, and then looked
at some of the messages from the moderation thread.

  I get the list via email, through a pcboard bbs, mixed in with all of
my personal email.  I wrote a program, to separate everything from the
list into separate folder.  Switching over to the unedited list, will
require a bit more for me, then just unsubscribe/subscribe.

  I'll wait and see if the moderation continues on the main list.  If it
does, I'll go through the bother of switching to the unedited list.

  Regards, Dave Hodgins.
