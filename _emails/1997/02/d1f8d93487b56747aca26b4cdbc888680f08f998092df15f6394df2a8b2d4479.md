There is no such thing as a trusted remailer, unless you know and trust the
remailer operator. That's why one should use remailer chains. If only one
remailer in the chain is run by a non-TLA operator, you are safe.

Just for the record, I know numerous remailer operators. I am convinced
that neither of them works for any TLA in any way. YMMV.
