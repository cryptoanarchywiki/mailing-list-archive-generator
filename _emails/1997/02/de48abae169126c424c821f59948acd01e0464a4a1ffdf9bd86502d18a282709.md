I haven't seen any rmgroups for alt.cypherpunks.  Paul Bradley's
newgroup for alt.cypherpunks is nowhere to be found, but Mike Duvos'
newgroup made it onto the Net, and was reposted the next day by 
usenet@news.myriad.ml.org.

Meanwhile, Paul Bradley seems to have finally figured out newgrouping
and has created...

        alt.cypherpunks.announce
        alt.cypherpunks.social
        alt.cypherpunks.technical

and, of course...

        alt.fan.paul.bradley

The latter has been rmgrouped because it was not discussed in 
alt.config. 

I might suggest that deliberately tweeking the whiskers of the Cabal by
gratuitous newgrouping is unlikely to bode well for alt.cypherpunks.
