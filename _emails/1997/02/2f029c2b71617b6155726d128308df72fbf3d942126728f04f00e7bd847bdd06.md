Information Warfare Conference
sponsored by DPMA/AITP

Washington, DC, March 13-14, 1997
Crystal City Marriott
1999 Jefferson Davis Highway
Arlington, VA  22202

Presentations by:
Major General Michael V. Hayden, Commander, Air Intelligence Agency
Dr. C. Kenneth Allard, Competitive Strategies
Col. H. Stevens, Land Information Warfare Activity

- current service visions and planned program initiatives
- operational concepts for 'third-wave' warfare
- information warfare drivers for 21st century C4I architectures
- emerging technologies and systems for information warfare 
superiority: opportunities on the horizon

'information warfare targets and vulnerabilities', Maxim I. Kovel,
 TASC systems management group

'information warfare for deterrence', William H.J. Manthorpe, Jr.
Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins

'adaptive techniques for counter-deception', James Llinas,
technical advisor, DOD JDL, Data Fusion group

'emerging threats come in all sizes and flavors', Eugene Schultz, SRI
consulting

"Information has been termed the 'fifth dimension' in the conduct of 
'third-wave' warfare, and promises to dramatically enhance the role 
of C4I as a force multiplier.  Joint and individual service doctrine 
is emerging for IW, ans is affecting the needs and requirements for 
diverse systems:  from space-based surveillance and communications 
systems to terrestrial image processing, visualization, and 
information fusion systems."

"This conference will provide a valuable forum where military and 
industry staff can interact with key decision-makers to achieve the 
most current possible understanding of Information Warfare concepts, 
initiatives, technologies and potential opportunities.  The Critical 
Questions to be addressed include:

- how is IW changing operational concepts?
- how can we defend the weak links in the planned 
information-intensive reconnaissance, strike, targeting architecture?
- what developments in enabling technologies are needed to support 
current Information Operations, Battlefield Visualization, and 
Information Exploitation initiatives?
-what can be done to develop defensive information technology 
capabilities?

            and last, but _c_e_r_t_a_i_n_l_y_ not least:

- how will we move forward to develop a true offensive IW capability
