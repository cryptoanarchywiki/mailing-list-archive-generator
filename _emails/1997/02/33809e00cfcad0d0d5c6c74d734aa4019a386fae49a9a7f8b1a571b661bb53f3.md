Unfortunately, the Government hasn't given up on this one;
Peter Gutman's recent articles on export policy in New Zealand and
Australia suggest that Our Public Servants are trying an end-run
by getting those countries to stop export and development by productive 
crypto authors, targeting the toolkits that are being widely used
inside and outside the US.

>2. The battle for key management has not yet been fought. 

Yeah.  I haven't heard much from Clipper III recently,
since they've been trumpeting Clipper IV "Key Recovery" recently,
but that doesn't mean it's not going on.  Unlike politican efforts
such as Key Recovery, infrastructure attacks such as PKI
may require long-term technical development - the Cooperative
Research and Development Alliances (CRADAs) are not just to
bribe otherwise-valuable companies to stay out of the way,
they're to do things that may be sprung on us later;
I'd predict this coming summer.  For instance, back in July,
John Young quoted a Business Wire article about
 =  Toronto -- Certicom Corp. a leading information security 
 =  company, today announced that it will participate in an 
 =  initiative by the U.S. Commerce Department's National 
 =  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) which will 
 =  lead to the development of the elements of a public key 
 =  infrastructure (PKI).  
Certicom are the folks who do Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems,
which haven't been used much due to patent questions and 
RSA's dominance, but which allow much shorter public keys
and may have some speed advantages, both of which are
quite important for smartcard use.

It failed, and they've now got an Ambassador strong-arming other countries
to prohibit export.

Yeah.  Clipper IV is getting a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon
to get export permission for their 56-bit software.  Many of the people
who are most vocal about it are the usual suspects anyway, but it's
closer to commercial usability that industry's more cooperative this round,
especially with more Internet money fever.
