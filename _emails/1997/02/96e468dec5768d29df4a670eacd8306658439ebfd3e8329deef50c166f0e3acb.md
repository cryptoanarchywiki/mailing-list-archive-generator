Let's not tempt them with something that the common person on the street
would consider computer media, I.E. punched cards and dataglyphs.  Remember
the old fonts that used to be everywhere?  The ones with the thickened
letters at key places?  Look at a check some time, that is the type of font
at the bottom, its designed to be readable by both man and machine.  Print
out the source code in one of those fonts and mail that.  This is not as
data intensive as the other way, but at least it can be argued that it can
be read by an unaided person.
That way, on the other end, the text can be scanned in directly, using a
modified form of check clearing software, and converted into electronic
media, sans errors.
