*** This is for Sandy and John, not for the list itself ***

Damn. Another example of the Tragedy of the Commons.

I'm sorry you decided to pull the plug -- but I fully understand your
reasoning. As I mentioned in an e-mail (and/or conversation a while back),
I'd be happy to help with the moderation as long as (a) it doesn't
prevent me from doing my "real" job and (b) we can figure out a solution
to the obvious logistics problems (I'm on a Mac, not a Unix box).

In any case, thanks to John and Sandy for all the hard work.

Martin.
