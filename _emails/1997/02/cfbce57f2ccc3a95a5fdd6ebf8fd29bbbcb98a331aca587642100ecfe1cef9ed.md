       Zip,NAda,Nothing. And they have more too. They were backlogged so
some people haven't gotten their mail since I last posted about. I called
yesterday about my videos and posters and lo and behold I received my two
tech manuals today.
       The people who answer the lines are friendly and usually pretty
industrious in getting things out or done.
       By the way there is supposed to be a department split in the near
future so I don't know if manuals will be in one department and posters in
another or what.
