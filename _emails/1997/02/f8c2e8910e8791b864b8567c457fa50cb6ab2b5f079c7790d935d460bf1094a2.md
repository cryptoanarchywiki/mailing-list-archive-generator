Toto,

The guy who actually cuts off the foreskin is called "mohel", not rabbi.

Once there was a very old mohel whose hands were shaky. He wanted to buy an
insurance policy in case he cut off too much. His insurance broker shopped
around and said: "I found this great insurance policy, but there's good news
and bad news. Good news is, you get a million dollar policy for only 20 bucks
a year. Bad news is, there's a two inch deductible."

ObModeratorComment: please don't buy Stronghold or any other product from C2.
