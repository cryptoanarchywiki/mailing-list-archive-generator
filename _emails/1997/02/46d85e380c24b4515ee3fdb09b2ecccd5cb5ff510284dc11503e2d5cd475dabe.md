In practice, we can't hold out much hope that donations to an AP system from 
"rich and powerful" people can be identified as such.  After all, with the 
appropriate software I could just as easily make 100, $10 donations as a 
single $1000 donation.  Assuming anonymity held, nobody but the donor knows 
from where the money came.

However, fortunately I don't think it would make any difference in the 
overall effects.    While AP would eliminate the taxation which is commonly 
thought of as the main way a "rich person" loses assets, in practice it 
would also shut down the well-hidden systems that allow some people to get 
rich (or, merely live off somebody else) "unfairly."   Government agents 
come to mind, of course.
