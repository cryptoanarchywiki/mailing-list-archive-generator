| The current subscription is between 1,000 and 2,000 I don't think that is
| _lots_. All we need to do is count the number of bounces per address in
| a given period, the SSZ end is trying to decide between weekly or
| monthly cleanings, and then clear that address. At no point would I need
| to archive the original bounce.

qmail has bounce management software for its list management tools.

eliminates any need to deal with bounces."
