From:	Attila T. Hun, member of the Early Bird Consortium of Stray Cats, 
quoting from the Pages of History:

    did not the Magna Carta guarantee the right of free speech?  Of
    course, there was not full suffrage at that time, but the Magna
    Carta is the basis of our common law.
		[and...]
    which gets down to just what the hell did my forefathers, and maybe
    yours, fight for in 1776 if it was not for freedom of speech and
    assembly, the right to bear arms, to be free from unreasonable
    search and seizure; and enjoy the protection of law?
................................................

Yes, if the Magna Carta guaranteed a right and the forefathers fought to 
secure it, why should any of us ever have to lift a finger in our own 
defense.

My contribution to this thread from the Cpunk History & Philosophy 
Division:   a Jewish saying from a book I glanced through of couple of 
weeks ago, something like:

	"What good is it to a man who has lost his sight
	  that his ancestors had perfect vision."
