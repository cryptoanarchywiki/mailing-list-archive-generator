>
>Rules for The Great DES Replacement Contest
>
>On 1997 Jan 02, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
>of The Department of Commerce announced the start of a process to
>approve an "Advanced Encryption Standard."  (See the Federal
>Register Vol. 62, No. 1, pp. 93-94; for example, by going to
>
>    http://www.lib.auburn.edu/gpo/index.html
>
>and searching the Federal Register for "Advanced Encryption
>Standard.")
>
>
>The first part of the process seems to be requesting comments
>on the cipher requirements and submission guidelines as follows:
>
>"Proposed Draft Minimum Acceptability Requirements and Evaluation
>Criteria
>
>    "The draft minimum acceptability requirements and evaluation
>criteria are:
>    A.1  AES shall be publicly defined.
>    A.2  AES shall be a symmetric block cipher.
>    A.3  AES shall be designed so that the key length may be increased
>as needed.
>    A.4  AES shall be implementable in both hardware and software.
>    A.5  AES shall either be (a) freely available or (b) available
>under terms consistent with the American National Standards Institute
>(ANSI) patent policy.
>    A.6  Algorithms which meet the above requirements will be judged
>based on the following factors:
>    (a) Security (i.e., the effort required to cryptanalyze),
>    (b) Computational efficiency,
>    (c) Memory requirements,
>    (d) Hardware and software suitability,
>    (e) Simplicity,
>    (f) Flexibility, and
>    (g) Licensing requirements."
>
>
>"Proposed Draft Submission Requirements"
>
>    "In order to provide for an orderly, fair, and timely evaluation of
>candidate algorithm proposals, submission requirements will specify the
>procedures and supporting documentation necessary to submit a candidate
>algorithm.
>
>    B.1  A complete written specification of the algorithm including
>all necessary mathematical equations, tables, and parameters needed to
>implement the algorithm.
>    B.2  Software implementation and source code, in ANSI C code, which
>will compile on a personal computer. This code will be used to compare
>software performance and memory requirements with respect to other
>algorithms.
>    B.3  Statement of estimated computational efficiency in hardware
>and software.
>    B.4  Encryption example mapping a specified plaintext value into
>ciphertext.
>    B.5  Statement of licensing requirements and patents which may be
>infringed by implementations of this algorithm.
>    B.6  An analysis of the algorithm with respect to known attacks.
>    B.7  Statement of advantages and limitations of the submitted
>algorithm."
