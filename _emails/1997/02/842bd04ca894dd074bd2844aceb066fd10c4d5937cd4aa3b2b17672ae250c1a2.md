Many Un*xes (SunOS, Solaris, IRIX, Linux, and probably others) have
included their own versions of sniffers, supposedly for network
debugging. These are typically called something like "tcpdump",
"etherfind", "snoop", etc.

You would need to run a sniffer at a "choke point" of an
organisation, for example the external router to the Internet, to
capture all of the packets to / from that organisation.  Putting a
sniffer on some arbitrary router out there in cloud-land would
probably not be all that productive, since there's no guarantee that
all of the IP packets carrying a given TCP connection would take the
same route.
