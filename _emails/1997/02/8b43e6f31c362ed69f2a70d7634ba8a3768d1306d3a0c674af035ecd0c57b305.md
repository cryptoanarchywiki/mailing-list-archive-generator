	Hi. The cypherpunks list is going through some major rearrangements,
and it appears that we need a bi-directional mail-news gateway for the new
group alt.cypherpunks and for whatever list(s) come out of the clouds of dust.
(The list(s) in question may be done in a distributed fashion across many
different machines, to lessen volume (1000+ subscribers, 100+ messages a day),
crash vulnerablity, and other problems.) Anybody have experience in running
a _really_ high-volume mail-news gateway (or in running distributed lists)?
Please cc: any replies to cypherpunks@toad.com.
	Thanks,
	-Allen
