Exactly.  I hate to intrude, but some of us kids learned that lesson
in something called "Sunday School" way back when.  The lesson was
"If you tell one lie, you'll have to tell another to cover it up,
then another and another until you're buried in the lies and your
credibility is shot".  A related lesson: "An excuse is the skin of
a reason packed with a lie".
