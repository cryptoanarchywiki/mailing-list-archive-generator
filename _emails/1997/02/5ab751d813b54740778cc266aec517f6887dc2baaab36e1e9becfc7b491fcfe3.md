    the "message" example which follows is obviously a message which 
    should have been destinated for owner-cypherpunks-flame.  there is 
    absolutely no indication of the differentation and the header shows:

        Sender: owner-cypherpunks@toad.com

    when it should have shown:

        Sender: owner-cypherpunks-edited@toad.com

    let's put it this way, if cp is to be censored, might as well do the 
    job correctly as this message was dumped into the main list.  

    regardless, censoring what is supposed to be the free speech 
    defenders of the online world is a poor example of our toleration 
    for differing viewpoints, regardless of their alledged stupidity or 
    off-topic value, or lack of value.  So far, cypherpunks is showing 
    less tolerance for freedom of speech that the United State Supreme 
    Court. You all know something I dont?  or do I need to start 
    cleaning and oiling real soon?
