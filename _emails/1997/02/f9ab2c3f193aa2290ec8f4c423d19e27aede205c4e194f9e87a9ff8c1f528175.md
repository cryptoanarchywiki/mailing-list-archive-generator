"Planned Parenthood". Has a nice ring to it, eh? Let's look at some
history:

Founded by Margaret Sanger (1879-1966).
Publisher of Birth Control Review.
Associate Henry Laughlin:
  Honorary MD from Heidelburg U (1936).
  Author of Hitler's Model Eugenical Sterilization Law.
  Author of "Mandatory Sterilization In The USA", published
   in Birth Control Review.
Associate Dr. Ernst Rudin:
  Director of Nazi Medical Experimentation program;
   commissioned to write for Birth Control Review.
Associate Dr. Lothrop Stoddard:
  Director, American Birth Control League.
  Vocal supporter of Nazis and their sterilization programs.
  Author of "The Rising Tide Of Color Against White Supremacy".
  Quote: "More children from the fit - less from the unfit. That
         is the chief aim of birth control." -from Birth Control
         Review circa 1921.

Margaret described her plan to depopulate the Blacks in the U.S. in
a private letter to Clarence Gamble, dated Oct. 19, 1939.  Her plan
was to hire Black ministers with engaging personalities to travel
thru the South to propagandize for birth control.  It was believed
that the best access to the Blacks was thru religion, and Sanger's
steering committee wanted to create the illusion that these projects
were under the control of the local Black leaders.

For those of you who don't know, there were a lot of successful
sterilizations in the U.S. when these programs were in effect during
Sanger's earlier years.  Persons wishing to research this should
also check Shockley, the transistor guy who won a Nobel prize for
something or other, and his friendship with George Bush et al.

I believe it was A&E channel that ran the Sanger TV-movie disinfor-
mation/propaganda a year or so ago.  You know, the channel that has
been described by critics as "All Hitler, all the time".
