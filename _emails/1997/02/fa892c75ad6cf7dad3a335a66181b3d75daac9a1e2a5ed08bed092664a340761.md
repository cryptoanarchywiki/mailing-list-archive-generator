C'punks,

You have probably just read John's post.  I truly hope YOU (each
and every one of you) can rise to his challenge.  If you have 
offered nothing in the past but criticism, it's now time to get a
bit more real.  What will it be, your money, time, equipment?

I would hope that the loudest advocates of "free speech" turn out
to be the most generous, but I'm not holding my breath.  Maybe 
the solution(s) will come from you lurkers.  I hope you can put
down your beer long enough to get involved.

Finally, if anyone wants to discuss why the Cypherpunk list has
come to this, or what I did right or wrong as a moderator, let's
talk about--on the new list(s) YOU create.  For now, though, it's
off-topic.  We have work to do.


 S a n d y

P.S.	To all those people who privately supported me in
	my attempt to help the list deal with its problems,
	thank you.  I wouldn't have come back without your
	and John's encouragement.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
