Details are on http://www.tis.com/docs/research/network/dns.html
It's a very interesting page - pointers to the RFC
http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc2065.txt ,
and downloadable beta code from TIS implementing it.  Cool stuff.

But then there's the politial correctness part of the web page :-)

Yup.  Can't let those Cubans secure their DNS.....  At least the government
did decide to permit export.
