I can't vouch for any of it, and I have my doubts about any company
that decides whether you're a "Scientist" based on whether you have a
PhD, but I thought it might put a cypherpunk in a position to do some
good:

Subject: CRYPTO RESEARCHER OR SCIENTIST

John,

I would greatly appreciate your recommendation.  I am trying to fill a
RESEARCHER and a RESEARCH SCIENTIST position for a leading East Coast
developer of encryption technology for the computer industry.

RESEARCHERS will work in conjunction with Research Scientists on
research projects covering all aspects of cryptography--from
algorithms, to protocols, to implementation.  RESEARCHERS also provide
technical support to software developers and to the company customers
through consulting and educational activities.

RESEARCHERS should have at least a B.S. and preferably an M.S. in
computer science, mathematics, or a closely related field. Solid
exposure to cryptography either through practical experience or within
academic pursuits is highly desirable.

RESEARCH SCIENTIST candidates should have a Ph.D. or equivalent
research experience in cryptography.

This company provides a very competitive compensation and benefits
package as well as company paid relocation benefits.

Thanks,

Dan Barrus
Senior Technical Recruiter
Cutting Edge Technologies
