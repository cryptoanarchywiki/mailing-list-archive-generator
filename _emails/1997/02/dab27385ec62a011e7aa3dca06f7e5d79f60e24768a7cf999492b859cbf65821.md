It's not clear from where I sit that the EFF is intrinsically evil.  A
case can be argued for their initial good intentions followed by the
subsequent poisoning of this intent by people with lots of money. Of
course, -any- organization is as susceptable to infiltration as their
weakest member.

If one is going to advocate free speech, I strongly suggest one
learns to deal with one's own greed and one's own need for power
first.
