Who says?  What if the public doesn't agree?  Might it not be better to 
sacrifice a few children to keep other children alive?

How much would this cost?  Who would pay?  Where would the money come from?  
Is this "solution" practical for everybody, or just the top guy?

Suppose that didn't work.  Who would kill the kids if the tyrant died?  Who 
would risk death himself to do this?  Etc.


Hint:  Unfortunately, you don't seem to be pursuing the implications of what 
you are hypothesizing.  This is typical.  Go back and do what I originally 
suggested:  Look at the motivations of EACH person in the "play" and decide 
why he will play along with the game.    This includes not merely the people 
you want to focus on, but also anyone else.
