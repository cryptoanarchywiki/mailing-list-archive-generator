That's fine...that's EXACTLY the way the system would work!  Intentionally 
so!  The purpose of the payment is not because the sender feels some sort of 
legal obligation to pay; rather it's analogous to a tip to a waiter.

The sender makes the payment based on however much he _wants_ you to pay 
attention to his message, but fully aware that there is no guarantee that 
you'll do so.
