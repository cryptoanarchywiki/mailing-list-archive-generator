PGPmail 4.5 now has beta 10 available - the download is smaller than beta 9.

Eudora Lite 3.0.1 also supports plugins, so it should work.
It also supports filters, which has allowed probable flames to
quietly vanish from my inbox :-)

BTW, from a non-government-user perspective, the questions asked to establish
export permission are nicely worded.  Rather than asking
"Are you a US Subject", and "Do you agree to follow every vague
detail of the Export Laws", as some sites do, it asks

and then has a button saying 
	"I certify that the above answers are truthful",
which is flexible enough that I don't have to feel bad about not being
_absolutely_ certain that my packets aren't getting routed through Canada,
or that I'm not on some list that bans telephone company employees from 
downloading cryptographic software on Tuesdays, or whether 
computers 30 feet above the US are subject to this week's export rules :-),
or having to say "No" to Question 2 because I understand that you _can_
export this software without a license (just do it) even though the Feds
disapprove....
