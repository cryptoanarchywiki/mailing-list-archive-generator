This article will be saved to
http://www.crl.com/~varange/netabuse/ or the NET ABUSE -
FALSE COMPLAINTS category of my index.html.

Six weeks or so is all the public access there is to the wtmp
file; ask Sandy or Stan if you don't know how to read it from
your own CRL account.  (How conveniant of you to accuse me of
the repulsive "Mark Wehal(sp?)" forgery past the date it can be
easily verified; why should the CRL admins drag out their backup
tapes on the account of your spurious allegations?  Anyone who
checked up Dejanews on "Mark Wehal" could have seen that some
user had forged his name as revenge spam against "Mark Wehal's"
offensive under 18 style sex spam in a few exceedingly odd
choice of newgroups, alas, "Mark Wehal" never complained about
the forgery and an unknown user may have been the instigator
of a business prank against a ligitimate electronics firm
whose street address was listed in the original sex spam.)

Or check the Here: line of my posts for better readability
than the additional standard Date: line.

"Our?"  Are you allowed to abuse the Stanford network because
you are a user, employee, or the actual admin?

If Graves is the actual admin, or is allowed to act like one,
then bona fide complaints about users conduct on the Stanford
network can't be sent directly via e-mail; send a registered
letter/return receipt to whomever is responsible (who?)

I read his post as a threat to the Stanford network.


Bogus complaints and forged posts from everyone under the sun:
