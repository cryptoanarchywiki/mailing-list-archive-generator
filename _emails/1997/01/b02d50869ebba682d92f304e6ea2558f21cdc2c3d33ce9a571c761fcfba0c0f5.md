I was distracted a bit but I believe I heard on NPR news this morning that
Colorado Guv. Roy Roemer showed up at an airport sans id and had a moment
of difficulty getting on his flight.  Roemer solved the problem by showing
the Federal Permission-To-Fly checker a picture of himself in a recent
newspaper.

I thought the ill-defined (or ill-described) rules required presentation
of a _government_ picture I.D.  Since when is a newspaper photo a
government picture I.D.?  

Some animals are more equal than others.
