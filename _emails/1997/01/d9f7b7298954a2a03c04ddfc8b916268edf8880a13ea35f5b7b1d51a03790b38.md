I wholeheartedly agree.  By now everyone's painfully aware that there
are 3 mailing lists.  It's not my responsibily (or Dale's) to encourage
cypherpunks subscribers to do what I think is best for them - resubscribe
to cypherpunks-unedited.  Folks who choose to let Sandy choose what they
read and don't read should be free to do that.
