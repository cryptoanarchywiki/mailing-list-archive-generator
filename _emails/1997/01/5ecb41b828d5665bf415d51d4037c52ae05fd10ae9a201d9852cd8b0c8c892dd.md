The real babes in So. Cal. go to tanning salons. That way the evenly-
distributed tan looks best with, say, a pure white bikini.  You can
go to the beach, of course, and hang out with the hoi polloi, but
it's mostly kids with pimples and stuff.

BTW, if y'all can't stay away, I have a list of So. Cal. nude beaches,
approx. 3 years old.
