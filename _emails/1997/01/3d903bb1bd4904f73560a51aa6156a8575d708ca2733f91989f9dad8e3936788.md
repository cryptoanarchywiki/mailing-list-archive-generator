And when that review finally reaches the appeals court,
the administration can move the regulations to the state department.

The uniqueness of the anti-crypto regulations is that it is a law
against intellectuals and academics. These people will not be willing to
break the law and then challenge its constitutionality in the courts,
or engage in any kind of civil disobedience demonstration. The author
of premail, for example, is doing a weird kind of civil *obedience*
demonstration to protect the laws. As long as that continues the
government can get away with playing their shell game.

By the way, what exactly happend to D.J. Bernstein's and the EFF's
threat to seek an injunction from Judge Patel if the new regulations
were not put on hold subject to constitutional review by January 2?
No updates at www.eff.org. Did EFF strike another deal with the
government?
