Rather than ripping off a commercial product,
from a company that's nice enough to give away free versions,
you can get Eudora Lite 3.0.1 from www.eudora.com;
I haven't yet installed PGPmail with it, but it should work,
and meanwhile it's nicely junking the more common flamers.
It is a beta version, but there should be another out soon.

This list isn't currently moderated.  The legality if it were
is unclear.
