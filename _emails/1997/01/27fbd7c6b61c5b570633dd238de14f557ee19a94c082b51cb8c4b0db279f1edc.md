How does Eric's box display the negotiated key to the user?  (I don't
recall the pair I saw having displays).

This is the approach taken by PGPfone also.  If the value of the
conversations was high (>$100,000?) passable voice imitation wouldn't
be that hard I suspect.

Also I thought it would be kind of cute if there were some way for
phones to exchange their signature keys `face to face' as well.

It's about time something was done about that problem.
