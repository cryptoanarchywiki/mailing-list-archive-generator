We do not disagree except neither of the metaphors I gave suggest
anything about the "putting in the bag" part of the deal.  In no
way does either suggest a right, power or even ability of anyone
to limit any freedom.  They are mute on the subject.  Their sole
meaning is that one CAN'T undo what is already done.  In the
instant case, that means the wide-spread availability of strong
crypto.
