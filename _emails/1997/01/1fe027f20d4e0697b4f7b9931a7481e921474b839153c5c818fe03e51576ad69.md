The idea that "sin" and "evil" are abstract and somewhat arbitrary is
merely a human (and therefore faulty) perception.

If God can be perfect by definition (for sake of argument), then "sin"
is taking one's attention from God's intent and turning to man's intent,
which is inherently selfish.  "Evil" is the selfish thing you do, when
you should do the unselfish thing.

These are not that difficult to understand, but are easily twisted by
selfish minds.

A gentleman wrote to Southern Partisan magazine a few years ago and
said "Real freedom is not the license to do whatever you want, but
rather the liberty to do what you ought to do".
