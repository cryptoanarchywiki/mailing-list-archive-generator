Sandy is irrelevant.  Why should we care if he tosses an article
to cyphepunks-flames or to the censored list?  Just subscribe to
cypherpunks-unedited and ignore Sandy.  If Gilmore persists in his
disgraceful behavior, create an unmoderated list elsewhere.

I think a lot of intelligent people have been wasting too much time
and energy analyzing the behavior of a twit who simply doesn't
deserve the attention his moderation effort has been getting.
