You would think that a company that could issue "$1,250,000 in collateral
backed zero-coupon bonds" would be able to afford a real web site.

Obviously.

Thank you, I was wondering about that.

No, not until your algorithm is made public and has been reviewed
by people who know what they are doing.  Most prudent crypto application
developers wait a few years after a new algorithm has been made public
to see if someone discovers flaws in it.

Unfortunately for you, the way you are announcing and promoting your
program makes it could like cryptographic snake oil.  Posting
such announcements to the cypherpunks list is a good way to get flamed.
Perhaps you should have posted to alt.biz.multi-level, where the
threshold of credulity is much higher.
