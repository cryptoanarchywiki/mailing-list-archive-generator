TMK, this is as close to a perfectly secure system as can be achieved.  *AS
LONG AS* the disks/discs are never compromised and never reused.

As an interesting sidenote, if you read Tom Clancy's "Sum of All Fears"
this is the type of system the CIA wants to implement even though the NSA
doesn't want to back them because they think their (compromised) sytem is
secure.  Don't we all wish...
