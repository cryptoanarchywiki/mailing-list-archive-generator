It is indeed a shame, and Carl's response was (of course) excellent.

The last chapter of the revised edition of the Codebreakers is reasonably
pro-government in the way it lays out the issue of key escrow, so perhaps
we shouldn't be surprised. (I'm told that David's sojourn at the NSA
museum was unexciting;  they wouldn't tell him much.) :)
