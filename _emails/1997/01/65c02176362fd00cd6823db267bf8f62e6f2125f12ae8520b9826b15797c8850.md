+   And the CDC is the Centers for Disease Control; and it has since
+found many, many prior cases of AIDS. These three minor errors are
+indicative of Attila's reliability of the subject. Of course, no one 
+at CDC or NIH believes any of this crap; it was tired a decade ago.

       A man is known by the company he keeps; floating nyms are the 
    mark of a coward; why not just wear the mark of the beast?        

        ... no_one@nowhere.org's utterance is an average pronouncement 
    by a prototypical megalomaniacal, hedonistic cypherpunk who on days 
    of lesser grandeur, humour, or importance corrects spelling and 
    grammatical errors --unlike the standards you apparently set for 
    yourself? 

        I claim neither a medical degree nor the trade of a medical 
    reporter; the information presented was solely an illustration of 
    an unfortunate circumstance for both the AIDS victim and society as 
    a whole. 

        As to the current relevance of the AIDS victim (who, for that 
    matter, may even have been an urban legend after a few historical 
    rewrites) in today's revisionist politically correct special-
    interest social cauldron as promulgated by the mass hysterimedia 
    (an environment which can, and has, rewritten the words of Thomas 
    Jefferson to accommodate the current social agenda), the point is 
    not only lost; it is mute, along with the truth --both your 
    perceived truth and the historical truth.

    you may not be next,
      but you are certainly too late to have been first.
