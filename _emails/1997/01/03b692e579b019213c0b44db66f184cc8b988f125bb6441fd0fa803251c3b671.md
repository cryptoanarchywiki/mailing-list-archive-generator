I like Java too, however it is getting to be a systems programming
language.  In my experience people are irrationally scared of it, too
(while happily tapping their secrets into MS-word, of course :-)

What I have in mind is more obviously restricted, and more like a 
programmable calculator (with bignums and buttons marked "DES") - no
sockets, no files, no system calls, etc.  Just number-crunching.
 
I take the point about Safe-TCL, but there must be some way of doing
this in a way that enough people think it's safe to run. 

Cheers,
Frank O'Dwyer.
