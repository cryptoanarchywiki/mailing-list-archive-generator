Your comparison with the fictional Gort, in the movie "The day the earth 
stood still" is of course apt.  It was only after I'd written most of the 
essay that I realized that an AP-type system would function much as Gort did.  

Occasionally we (CP) see a spoof where somebody claims to have developed a 
software program to "replace the judicial system" or something like that.  
Well, the problem with such a claim (aside from the obvious and enormous 
AI-type difficulties) is that the current system contains numerous biases.  
Writing a program to replace the legal system would presumably require that 
these biases be measured (and admitted-to!) and implemented into a 
well-defined system.  

What we'd discover is that the current system only barely resembles the 
guarantees in the US Constitution. At that point, there would be an argument 
between those who will insist that the Constitution be followed, and those 
who believe that the current de-facto system, however biased, be maintained 
as-is.
