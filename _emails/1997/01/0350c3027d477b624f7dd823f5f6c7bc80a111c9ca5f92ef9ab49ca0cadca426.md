This was an utterly fascinating post, if y'all don't mind my saying so.
I certainly can't vouch for the details (or the theories), but whether
any of the details are deliberate experiments on Dimitri's part or not,
the totality of what has taken place would make an excellent source
for a post-graduate study.  Am I right?

I would suggest, however, if you're looking for a likely candidate for
really advanced social manipulation/experimentation, you should be
looking at the list owner(s), not the gadflys.

There's this silly theory some people have, that once in a while the
little people (the good guys?) win enough points to set the bad guys
back a ways.  Not in 20th century Amerika.  Read Carl Oglesby's
article "Paranoia As A Way Of Knowing", and think: "Paranoia As A Way
Of Knowing Who We Are."
