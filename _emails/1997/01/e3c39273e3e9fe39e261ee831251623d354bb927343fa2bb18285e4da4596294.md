Most definately. All you need to do is prove that the set of this number is
uncountable, ergo is irrational. If you have friend who have done math in real
analysis they can explain more.

If you show me an algorythm that calculates the real number TT (=3.14.....)
I'll give you a Nobel Prize personally!

>

 >

 >
Exactly! This is called recursive definition. To get the p-th set in the
sequence you need to find p-1 first...

>Also, is it the correct definition of a real number: 
 >
 >``A real number is the class of numbers which can represent the length of

Well, that is not entirely true... The length of any arbitrary line can be any
number, rational, natural, etc. Real numbers are the numbers that defy all
other categorization (they are not rational, irrational, natural, etc.) They
are complex and despite any instinctual perception, there are a lot of them!
 
I don't know if these maed a lot of sense but all of these questions are
answered in a good Elementary Real Analysis book.

Sincerely,
