Those of us in the US have the luxery of secret ballots, Iraq is not.  What
was reported to me (by the media) was that those who decided to vote against
Hussein, in a time when food was scarce, decided to vote against eating.  It
was not made illegal to vote him out, merely a catch 22, unless enough
people agreed openly, the vocal minority would suffer.  What we should have
been doing as the troops pulled out and a no fly zone was being established
was dropping bombs full of bread on the populus.  Then they could have voted
any which way they chose.

I don't remember where I heard this, and in all likelyhood, I heard it here.
This is certainly not a direct quote, ant would the origional poster please
speak up.

There came a time, in some ancient civilization when the king committed
suicide by eating poisoned food.
In the remaining week, most of the household, apparently in honor of the
deceased king, jumped on kitchen knives and butcher knives, killing themselves.
The brother of the king would not come out of hiding because some unknown
person was terrorizing him with a meat cleaver.
After a year, it was apparent that no one in the line of succession still
survived, all killing themselves with kitchen utensils.  It was rumored that
the post was cursed.  It was then that the royal galley slave bravely
stepped foreward to rule the kingdom until one of the origional line should
return.
The decendants of the galley slave have ruled to this day.

Like I said, I don't know where this came from, but I would like to see it
again, if it came from here.
