I can give you an example.

``Jim Choate invented an improved bubble sort method, called BSAM.''

This is undoubtedly false since you likely did not invent any sorting
method. But you would not be able to get any damages (is that correct?)

You can either oppose "specieocracy" and inequality of rich and
poor in libel litigation, or ask to place bonds that will make even
harder for the poor to sue, BUT NOT BOTH, if you want to remain logical.
