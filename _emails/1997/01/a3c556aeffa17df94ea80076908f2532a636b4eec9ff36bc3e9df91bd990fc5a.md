Not only from individual to individual.


Please consider the changes in the concepts of "sin", "freedom", "good", 

and "evil" which occur over <italic>time even within the same
individual</italic>; to wit the on and off again love affair with our
nation's past "enemies; individual responses to drug use especially
alcohol; premarital sex (ok for me but not my daughter).


This constant flux within both society and individual makes creation and
implementation of rules extremely difficult and hazardous.
