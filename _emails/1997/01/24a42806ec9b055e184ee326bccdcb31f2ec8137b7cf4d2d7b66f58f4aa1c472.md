Dear Cypher Punks,

I BEG YOU TO HELP ME!!!

Is it possible to prove that number 0.1234567891011121314151617181920...
iz irrational? 

Or may be it is rational?

Also, another question for math geniuses here: 

Is it REALLY true that there are real numbers that cannot be generated
by any algorithm? Some guy said that since the set of algorithms is
countable, but the set of real numbers is more than countable, there 
must be some numbers for which there is no algorithms that generate them.

But I still do not believe him.

Also, is it true that the sequence of digits in e is random because the ONLY way to get to the
p'th digit is to calculate the p-1'st digits?

Also, is it the correct definition of a real number: 

``A real number is the class of numbers which can represent the length of
an arbitrary line.''


I AM REAL DESPERATE FOR YOUR ASS ISTANCE.
