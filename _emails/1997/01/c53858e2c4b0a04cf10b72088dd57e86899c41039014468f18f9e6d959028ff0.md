Yee-hah!  Congratulations (and enjoy the $1000 check!)
So what did you do interesting cryptographically in the crack, 
other than coordinating a bunch of workstations?
Was it just brute force with well-tuned code?
Given the figures in your press release, it sounds like you
tested about 350 billion keys out of a trillion possible,
so you hit the winner a shade early.  That's about 400,000 keys/sec/box.
Are the machines mostly Pentiums, Alphas, Suns, etc.?
