Well halellujah.

OH! OF COURSE! IMDMP! COOL!!

WOW!! 150!!!

> o Is a very cost-effective size of only 60 kilobytes.
> o Implements the IMDMP encryption algorithm.

Of course, who doesn't?!

> o Allows encryption keys as large as 2048 bits.

18?! HOLY COW!!

> o Processes all forms of binary and ASCII files.

What a breakthrough! Astounding!!

> o Allows multiple encryption layer levels.

Of course not, it's IMDMP!!

> o Includes time and date locking features.

Specific unique encryption features!! NO WAY!! COOL!!!

> o Includes file authentication guard features.
> o Includes digital signaturing capabilities.

Of course, everyone knows the public key cryptosystem method is the
best! Excellent!

Hey, v2.0, neat name, where'd you come up with it?!

AOL!! Oh YES! Cool!

Oh most certainly! I'm gonna run out and implement EVERYTHING in UDCM!!
Thanks man!!
