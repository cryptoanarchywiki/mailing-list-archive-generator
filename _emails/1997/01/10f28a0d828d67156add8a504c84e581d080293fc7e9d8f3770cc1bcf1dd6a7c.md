I find Oksas's posts to be very interesting.

"Anonymous" is lying - I never posted any such thing.  of course the
cocksuckr moderator passed on the "anon's" lies to the censored mailing
list, and I bet he's goingto auto-bounce my refutation to "flames"
- just as everyone had predicted.

If you don't like the sandfart's moderation policy, you can just read the
unedited list and institute your own moderation policy using 'procmail'.
That's pretty much what the sandfart does anyway. Fluff from people he likes
makes it to the censored list (like a request to jya's bot cc'd to the whole
censored list) whie anything I or Toto or Oksas say is auto-junked.
