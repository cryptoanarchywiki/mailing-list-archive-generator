For those who may doubt my oft repeated prediction that coercive institutions will slowly dissolve into market institutions please note that next week New York State is having a Sales Tax "sale."  All clothing purchases under $500 will be free of sales tax next week.  That's 8.25% in New York City.  Since CT and NJ don't tax most clothing sales this is clearly an attempt to meet the competition.

Also for those who might like to become international fugitive financiers some day (like Marc Rich) see the business section of today's New York Times:

Fugitive Financiers Find Fewer Places to Hide
By PETER TRUELL

Currently at:

http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/financial/fugitive-financiers.html

"To improve the Justice Department's record for capturing big-time fugitives, Attorney General Janet Reno last month started an interagency fugitive alert service, in conjunction with the United States Information Agency and the Voice of America.  The effort includes a site on the World Wide Web           (http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/oiafug/fugitives.htm) showing pictures of the most wanted fugitives."
