Ross, I agree in principle, but not in fact.  If the "removed" list
was accurate, I'd say yes, but not only is it suspect, Sandy admitted
personally that some items could "fall thru the cracks" and not make
it to either the edited or removed list.

The only way to guarantee the removed list is to subtract the censored
list from the uncensored list, and hope that the uncensored list is
complete.
