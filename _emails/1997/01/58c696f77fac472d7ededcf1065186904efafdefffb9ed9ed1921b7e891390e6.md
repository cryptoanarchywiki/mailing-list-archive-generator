     It gives me another perspective to work from. No answers to such 
appeals are taken as gospel. They are considered, tested where appropriate,
and then either implemented, or disgarded.

     In certain areas I am liable to give certain answers more "weight" 
depending on various things (usually some sort of reputation calculation),
but I only really trust (well to certain levels) myself.
