-1- Review '96/Preview '97

ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT
  In 1996, Oprah Winfrey is selected best performer of
  the year, but who  will win in 1997? Will the much 
  advertised Sunset Beach sizzle your TV screens?

BUSINESS & FINANCE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Blacks and Hispanics spent over $630 billions 
  that outpace white spending in such areas
  as cars, children's clothing and perishable foods.
  Baby boomers invested over $1.2 trillion in 1996 and
  the Dow posted a record high. What will become of 1997?

GOVERNMENT/POLITICS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In 1996, President Clinton won the White House, 
  and he promised to build a bridge into the 21st century. 
  His campaign, however, was without complains: 
  fund raising flap and  his personal character, to name
  but a few. At the dawn of this new year is his 
  inauguration. 

  What will become of Clinton's Presidency in 1997
  and Gingrich's helm at the House?
