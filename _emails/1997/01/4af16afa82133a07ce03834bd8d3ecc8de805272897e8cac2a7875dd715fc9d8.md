The conference will run from 8:30 AM to 12:30 PM, for five days, February
24-28 1997. Breakfast provided at the conference. The conference
organizers have left the afternoon and evenings open for corporate
sponsored events, for networking, and for recreational activities on the
resort island of Anguilla. Participants are encouraged to bring their families.

Workshop:

A 40-hour workshop, intended for anyone with commercial software
development experience who wants hands-on familiarity with the issues and
technology of financial cryptography, is planned in conjunction with FC97,
to be held during the week preceding the conference.

For more information on the workshop, please see the URL
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~iang/fc97/workshop.html .

For workshop registration, see the URL
http://www.offshore.com.ai/fc97/ .


Venue:

The InterIsland Hotel is a small 14-room guesthouse and a large,
comfortable 150 seat conference facility with additional space for a small
10-booth exhibition. The Inter-Island is on Road Bay, near Sandy Ground
Village, in the South Hill section of Anguilla. The conference, workshop,
and exhibition will have TCP/IP internet access. The rooms at the
InterIsland itself have sold out, but there are many other hotels
and guesthouses on Anguilla, and shuttle service to the conference will be
available.

Air Transportation and Hotels:

Air travel to Anguilla is typically done through either San Juan or St.
Thomas for US flights, or St. Maarten/Martin for flights from Europe and
the US.

Anguillan import duties are not imposed on hardware or software which will
leave the island again. There are no other taxes -- or cryptography
import/export restrictions -- on Anguilla.

Hotels range from spartan to luxurious, and more information about hotels
on Anquilla can be obtained from your travel agent, or at the URL
