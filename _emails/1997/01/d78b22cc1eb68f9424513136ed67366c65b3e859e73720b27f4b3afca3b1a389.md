IBM or Mac?

Methinks (and I haven't tried it, but I think I will soon) that
at least on the IBM side, the usual realm of existing software
(SecureDrive/SecureDevice are the first things that come to
mind) ought to work.  After the Iomega ZIP drivers are in place,
the Zip drive is 'just another drive' as far as most applications
can see.
