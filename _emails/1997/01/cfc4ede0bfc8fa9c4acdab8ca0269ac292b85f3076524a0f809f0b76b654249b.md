I've found another collection of references on speech scanning/recognition, the
February 1989 CACM, p.193, contains 38 references going back to 1980.  It'd be
an interesting exercise for anyone with access to a large library to trace back
through these (some of them look promising, like a 1980 book "Trends in Speech
Recognition" from which a number of references are taken) to see how far back
you can go and at what point certain things became feasible.  The CACM
references would be a good starting point for a search.
 
Peter.
