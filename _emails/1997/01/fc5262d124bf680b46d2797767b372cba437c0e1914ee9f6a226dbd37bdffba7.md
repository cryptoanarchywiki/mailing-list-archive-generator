All you've got to do is super-encrypt the IDEA encrypted traffic with
the standard A5 hardware - the base station won't notice the
difference.

Schematically, standard GSM hardware:

                       +-------------+
      +-----------+    | compress/   |        +------------+
  <-->| A/D & D/A |<-->| decompress  |<------>| A5 enc/dec |<-->
      +-----------+    +-------------+        +------------+


schematically, adding a super-encryption layer:

                       +-------------+
      +-----------+    | compress/   |        +------------+
  <-->| A/D & D/A |<-->| decompress  |<-|  |->| A5 enc/dec |<-->
      +-----------+    +-------------+  |  |  +------------+
                                        v  v
                                  +-------------+
                                  | IDEA/RSA/DH |
                                  +-------------+


So the question was (addressed to anyone who knows anything about the
electrical interfaces used in GSM) about standardisation of electrical
interfaces -- for instace if the electrical interface between the
voice compression/decompression IC and A5 IC were standardised, you
could build a replacement voice codec IC which performed IDEA/RSA/DH
as well as standard the voice codec function, and had the same pin
out.  This IC would allow a wide range of GSM phones to be upgraded
with minimal effort on the part of GSM phone manufacturers -- or even
desoldered and replaced by end users, or crypto hardware company.

However, there are several reasons why it would probably require
proper integration into a GSM phone design:

- keys tied to phone number memories
- display of signature result on screen
- PIN for phone's RSA signature keys
- face to face key exchange
- key revocation
- generating new keys
