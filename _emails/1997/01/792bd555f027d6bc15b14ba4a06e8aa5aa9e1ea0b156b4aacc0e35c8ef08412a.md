I ran a quick Kappa test on it.  There was a nice fat spike at key
length 25, as somebody else suggested, but an almost perfect
correlation at 100.  The message is almost certainly a simple
polyalphabetic cipher with keylength 100.

I've been playing with it, and have maybe 5% of it decoded.  It's
full of really blatent clues.  Kind of fun.
