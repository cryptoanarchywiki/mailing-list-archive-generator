In particular, if you allow free non-commercial evaluation of beta software,
e.g. McAfee's virus protection software, that would probably qualify.

It's interesting that they've structured their requirements to try to stay
within the Constitutionally authorized powers (regulation of interstate
and foreign commerce) while leaving out freeware which might lead to
an annoying legal challenge.
