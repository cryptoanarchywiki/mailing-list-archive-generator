Well the obvious answer is to RTFM (Note: F is for fine) on DOS version,
its quite big. Also you seem to need Win PGP shell of some sort so that
you won't have to type those commands, i memorised my commands on the
3rd day of usage so no big deal about shells.

And then you cat'n'paste the code into your e-mail.

In some cases you can set it up as a spell checker ;)

Later.
