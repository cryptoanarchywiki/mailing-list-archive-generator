The admin blurb flames L.Detweiller, a noted cryptographer hated by
J.Gilmore and T.May because he exposed their lies and hypocricy.
Flames directed at "non-persons" are allowed on the censored mailing
list. Responses from the victims of the slander, any any critical
discussion of the moderation policy are tossed to cypherpunks-flames.

If you don't like it, start your own unmoderated list.
