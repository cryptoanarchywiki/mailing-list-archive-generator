Dimitri is a low life piece of Russan shit who is trying to distroy this
list because he has serious mental
problems or he is a tool of the NSA.

What part of his vicious personal and anomyous attacks against  members of
the list  'are not being read
correctly'?

What part of his calling everyone on this list that won't put up with his
deliberate abuse, "fagots",  'are not being read correctly'?

If you don't get it, you are a *really dumb fuck* or a KTOM tool.
