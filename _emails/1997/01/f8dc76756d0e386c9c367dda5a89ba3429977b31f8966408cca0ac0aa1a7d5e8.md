Of course, Dimitri, you and I are just paranoid. John Gilmore is really
Mother Teresa, and he dedicates his time and valuable equipment solely
to our personal betterment.  John has no agenda other than the uplifting
of mankind.  How could *anyone* possibly think that what John says and
what John really means could be two different things.

Now, I've stated this on the list before, but nobody's reading us, so
it won't matter if I repeat it [hee hee].  John has the full attention
of the FBI, CIA, and several other such orgs (any disputing that?).
Those guys are about as likely to allow John to do whatever John wants
as they are likely to allow you and I to run our own currency exchange
in Barbados, unhampered by them.

This cuts both ways:  If Gilmore kept the list open, the feds can sit
on their butts and troll to their hearts' content.  One presumes the
list is a good source of names and info, even if some of the names are
just connections to other leads, in other areas of business even.

If Gilmore wrecks the list, it has the very distinct possibility of
discouraging a *successful* replacement list for some time to come,
perhaps forever.  Think about how successful the assassination business
was for the feds for some time - today they get patsys and hide them
away for years awaiting trial, while the feds run their cases almost
entirely through the media.  Gilmore's silence has a familiar ring....
