Anyone running Windows 95 who hasn't grabbed the beta of PGPmail 4.5 from 
http://www.pgp.com/ is crazy.  It works seamlessly with Netscape 3.0 and Eudora Pro 3.0.  The 30-day demo of Eudora Pro is at: http://www.eudora.com/prodemo/.

It is easy to use.  I just installed it and pointed it at my old pubring.pgp and secring.pgp files and went to work.  All my messages have been signed since then and some have been encrypted.  The installation program found my existing copies of Eudora and Netscape and installed the PGP add in without any fuss.

My only problem was finding the controls for the add in which (in the case of Eudora) consist of buttons to encrypt, sign, bring up the program, insert a copy of your key, and actually modify the message.  The controls only appear on the message create, and message read windows.

Easy to use.
