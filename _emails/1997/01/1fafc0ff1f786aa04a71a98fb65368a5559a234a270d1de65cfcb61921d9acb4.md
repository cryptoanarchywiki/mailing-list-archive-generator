The commercials between the movie and news show on the airline include an
IBM spot on their new Key Recovery software.  Sigh.

The explanations they gave were mixed; one person was talking about
making sure that if you lose the key that people with a legitimate need
to access the material can do it.  The other example they gave, with
pictures, was along the lines of
"Suppose you're going on vacation and you want to leave a key with
a neighbor to feed the dog.  A safe way to do it would be to put your house
key in a lockbox that needs several keys to open it, and give those keys
to people you trust."  Yeah, right - cops can get in, but Dog's gonna get 
pretty hungry....
