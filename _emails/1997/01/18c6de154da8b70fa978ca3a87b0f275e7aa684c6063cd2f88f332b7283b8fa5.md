  This "freely available overseas" concept is a bit overstated.
France and other countries are beginning to come down hard
on encryption. (Also note the post from the guy in New
Zealand on the hassles exporting from his country.) The 
US now has a "Crypto Ambassador" roaming the world,
and I *don't* think he is encouraging an open common
encryption standard.

  Cynic or realist, you make the call. <G> The average Joe
doesn't even know *why* he needs encryption...at least
not yet.
