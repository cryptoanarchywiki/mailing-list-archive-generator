It looks pretty good, but the beta I downloaded last night did not have
the plug-in install file as described in the help file.  I need to read
the manual and find out what it takes to install by hand.

It looks very promising though.

(They are also going to be doing a one time deal for PGP 2.6.2 users and
offering the software for about $30.00.  The full version is about $120.00
or so.  (Memory is not working 100% this morning...  Need more coffee.))
