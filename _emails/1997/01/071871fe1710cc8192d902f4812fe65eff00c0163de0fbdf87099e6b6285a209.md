Before you get too carried away by the capabilities of off the shelf
character recognition, read Phil Karn's experience trying to produce
a working DES program from the pages of Applied Cryptography.  It was
easier than writing it himself, but it was still far from a turnkey
operation.  This is from <URL:

> 5. I began by first photocopying, on a standard office photocopier, the
> 18 pages containing the Triple DES source code listing from Part V of
> the Book. This took about 5 minutes. Second, I scanned in the 18 sheets
> on a Macintosh Quadra 610 computer system equipped with an HP ScanJet II
> flatbed scanner and Omnipage Professional optical character recognition
> (OCR) software. The computer, scanner, and software are all readily
> available through normal consumer computer supply channels. The total
> scanning process took about one and a half hours. About an hour of this
> time was spent learning to use the scanning system and conducting trial
> runs, as I had only used it briefly some time ago. The actual scan of the
> 18 pages took about 15-20 minutes. Third, I transferred the resulting
> machine-readable file from the Macintosh to my own personal computer
> and brought it up under GNU EMACS, a popular and widely available text
> editing program that I have used for many years. In EMACS I compared,
> by eye, the scanned file displayed on my screen against the printed
> listing in the Book. I began correcting the scanner's many errors, such
> as mistaking the digit '0' for the letter 'O' or mistaking the vertical
> bar '|' for the letter 'I'.

> 6. After manually correcting those errors noticed through visual
> comparison with the Book, I invoked the "C" language compiler on the
> (partially) corrected file. The compiler immediately pointed out
> additional errors I had overlooked in my visual inspection so I could
> also correct them by reference to the Book. I also noticed several errors
> in the listing printed in the Book. However, the programmer's intentions
> were obvious from the context of each error and were easily fixed. About
> fifty minutes later, I successfully compiled the file without error.

> least one error went undetected by the compiler in either the code as
> printed in the Book or as scanned. Scrutinizing the code more closely,
> I quickly found another error in the printed version that was easily
> corrected. However, it still did not produce correct results. After about
> an hour of searching, I finally located the error in a list of numbers
> in a table -- another error in the printed version. By reference to the
> DES algorithm description in the first part of the Book, which includes
> the correct numbers in tabular form, I found and corrected the error.

> the Disk with all errors removed, including those printed in the Book
> as well as those added by the scanning process.
