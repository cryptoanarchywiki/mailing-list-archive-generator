  Exactly. The same think happened at Kent State, when an extremely
small
segment of the student body forced U.S. Government forces to shoot them.

  Speaking of 'colouring', Mr. Rabid Revisionist-smallsegmentinextreme,
perhaps you might be so kind to explain the use of the word 'elected'
as it applies to an announcement that a single individual had decided
to act for the good of all, irregardless of the wishes of others.

  Social responsibility includes speaking up when the king has no
clothes,
except for the armband with the Swastika on it.
