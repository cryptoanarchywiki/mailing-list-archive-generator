If that is the only chink in the armor you see, then you aren't looking
very hard. The point of this system is not to prevent exports, but to (1) 
comply with the letter of the law by discouraging export in the specified
manner, (2) to comply with the spirit of the law by reducing the number of
exports of cryptographic software from the USA, while (3) making
publication of strong cryptographic software in North America easy and
safe from legal persecution. Without point (3), the national security of
the USA would be harmed, IMHO, by the fact that proportionally more
dishonest people (the ones the NSA and FBI are quict to draw attention to)
than honest ones (the majority of the people who want to use strong
cryptography to protect their privacy and business interests from the
dishonest folks) would use strong cryptography. 

The only reason I can think of that the U. S. Commander-in-Chief and
President of the United States of America and his staff have determined
that export of strong cryptographic software can harm "national security" 
even when such software already is available outside of the USA, is that
they are really more concerned about the numbers of people that use such
software regularly, and therefore, they want to limit the total bandwidth
of distribution capacity and ease of retrieval of such software. Export
controls can effectively do both, even if they cannot realistically
prevent export.

Think about it. It was a pain to set up the EAR-compliant site that I set
up compared to a simple site for global distribution, and few people would
go through the hassle. Many major information services and ftp sites
simply disallow strong cryptographic software rather than go through the
hassle. Because of this, it is probably true that fewer people find,
download, and use strong cryptographic software.

Until more people set up more strong cryptographic software distribution
sites and write more good, secure, robust, easy-to-use cryptographic
software such that it is about as easy to find and use it as not to, the
Feds win. Their point is proven. Fewer people use strong cryptography than
would otherwise, and some small (but, to them, significant) percentage of
those people who were discouraged from using strong cryptographic software
might have used that software in a criminal activity. Too bad about the
good guys who could have prevented computer crime or worse with the same
technology, huh?
