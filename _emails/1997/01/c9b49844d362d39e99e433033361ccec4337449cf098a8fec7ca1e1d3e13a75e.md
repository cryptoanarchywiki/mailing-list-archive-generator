]OTOH *you* are a lying, vicious, sick, perverted, homophobic Russian scumbag.

Ray "Arsen" Arachelian admitted being an Armenian. You can complain about
his net-abuse to his boss <jack@earthweb.com>.

In the words of the Russian-Scottish poet Mikhail Lermontov,
 "Ty rab, tu trus, ty armyanin."

ASALA is the terrorist Armenian organization responsible for the murders
of dozens of Turkish diplomats and civilians.

No wonder they want to use strong crypto to cover up their terrorist acts.
