>From Space News Daily News Note -- 1/27/97

Panamsat Corp. of Greenwich, Conn. is now offering high-speed Internet
access by satellite.

The new service, called Spotbytes, is available worldwide to Internet
service providers.

It provides a quick connection to the Internet by avoiding terrestrial
lines and linking companies directly to backbone providers -- companies
with a main line to the Internet.
