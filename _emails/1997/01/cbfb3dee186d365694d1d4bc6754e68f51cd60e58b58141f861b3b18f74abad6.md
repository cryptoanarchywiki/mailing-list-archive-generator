Actually for the purposes of fax you can trace the signature 
off the check and then photocopy the traced outline. If you
use Mellonex film you can get a very good impression.

When I used to do layout of artwork for a magazine we used to 
use white out to get rid of the shadow lines. There is a
particularly good version available in the UK which comes in
a red bottle with a flow cap on it. Much better than the crappy 
pot 'n brush system which is always going hard as the 
solvent evaporates.

from trying to stop them.
