I can at least vaguely understand the rationale behind restricting the
export of cryptography. But I don't even begin to comprehend
restricting the export of data security software. What is going on
here? Whose idea is this, what is the agenda?

Is the US government really prepared to take on all the producers of
virus protection software? Symantec and IBM are pretty big players to
upset. And they don't even have the "drug dealers and terrorists"
bugbear to defend this particular export restriction.

In my more cynical mood I'm afraid that what's going on is the US
government is trying to protect its capability to wage information
warfare. Could they get away with this?
