I received the following from Jonathan.  Those of you who are interested in
KeyKOS should know that his system, EROS, is an architectural descendent of
KeyKOS.

Subject: Talk info NOTE TIME CORRECTION

I'll be giving a talk on Wednesday at Stanford in the EE380 seminar.
Details on the seminar can be found at

	http://www-leland.stanford.edu/class/ee380/

under 'winter 1996'.

The location and time are:

	Wednesday at 4:15pm
	Hewlett Packard Auditorium (Room B1)
	Gates Computer Science Building
	Stanford Univeristy

The basic structure of the talk will be:

	explain what active networking means, and why confinement and
		fault isolation are required.
		(the problem)

	identify the properties needed for confinement and fault
		isolation proofs, what capabilities are, and why
		non-capability systems do not have these properties
		(why we need them)

	describe the objects named in EROS/KeyKOS, and why these are
		the right choices for high performance
		(how to get performance)

	show how this system might be used to construct an active
		networking router or endpoint.
		(how to use them for this problem)

I'm still working on the talk, so the order may get rearranged.

Hope to some or all of you there.


Jonathan
