I would say that there had been a lot more than "some of that".
I believe that moderation as proposed does not really limit
anyones Freedom of Speech.  After all the list is intended as a
forum to discuss the topic of cryptography and it's use by
society, the list is not advertised as a free for all abuse
forum or an unlimited conduit for spam.

If you want Freedom of Speech go stand on a soapbox in your
local town square.  Would you complain that people who choose
to walk on by and not listen to you are violating your right to
Free Speech?

Cypherpunks has the right to say "Enough, take the raves, rants
and spam somewhere else".  You are free to say what you want, but
if it is off-topic, I don't want to see it in my inbox.

You will certainly be in the minority, but you are right,
the choice is yours to make and everyone else's as well.
