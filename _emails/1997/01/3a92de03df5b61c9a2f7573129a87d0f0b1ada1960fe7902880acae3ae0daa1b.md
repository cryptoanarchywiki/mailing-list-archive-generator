I'm afraid you've fallen into one of the standard traps.  A PRNG can *not*
make a OTP no matter how you use it.  

The total amount of entropy in a PRNG is the amount of entropy in the seed 
you use to key it.  All the other bits are directly derived from that seed.

A true OTP is completely secure from an information-theory point of view
because every byte has a full eight bits of entropy.  A PRNG can never
have this.

Having said all this, it is possible to make a good cipher from a PRNG.
RC4, for example, is exactly that and the variable sized key is the
seed for the PRNG.  It is however very difficult to come up with a
good algorithm for that cryptographically sound PRNG and you would
be much further ahead to use an existing one rather that trying to
roll your own.

I don't see anything wrong as such, but there is nothing to be gained either.
If your random data is real OTP material there is no need to skip to a random
byte within it, just start at the beginning and use it in sequence.  If your random
data is the output of a PRNG like the above then random starting point doesn't
buy you much additional security because the entire set of keying material can
be recreated from the seed.  It may increase the work-factor of searching for
the key, but it also imposes the practical problem of keeping all that keying
material secure.

More importantly don't confuse statistically random with cryptographically
random.  Just because a bunch of bits passes all the randomness test
you can think of doesn't mean it contains 100% entropy.  Consider the
digits of an irrational number like sqrt(2) or pi, the digits appear statistically
random but they can be recreated from just a tiny bit of knowledge.

A good litmus test is to ask yourself if there is any way you can
reproduce those bits.  If there is, they aren't a one time pad.
(Of course even if you can't it doesn't mean they are good. :-)
