This point, unfortunately, seems to be lost in the woods.  At the
panel discussions in this conference, so many people used phrases
like "... law enforcement doing what they need to do..." on *both*
sides of the GAK fence.  "Need" to do?  Well, they might "need" to
do lots of things under their own view of reality, but that doesn't
mean it's reasonable to negotiate towards that position.  Why is
it that just because one party shows up with a wacked-out agenda that
the "honorable" thing to do is work towards a consensus solution?
