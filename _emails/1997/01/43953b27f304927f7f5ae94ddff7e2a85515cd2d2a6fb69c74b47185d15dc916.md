Alex Kelly, our favorite Greenwich Connecticut high school jock, accused
rapist, ex-fugitive who returned to the US to face trial after 8 years on
the run in Europe has done it again.  He filed the paperwork to gain
recognition of Irish citizenship from the Irish Consulate and his claim has
been recognized.  He is now free to apply for an Irish Passport.  The DA is
trying to yank his $1,000,000 bail.

The wire services incorrectly report that he has been "granted" Irish
citizenship.  Actually, like anyone who has at least one grandparent born
in Ireland, he *is* an Irish citizen under that nation's permissive
nationality law and merely had to register his (overseas) birth with the
Consulate.
