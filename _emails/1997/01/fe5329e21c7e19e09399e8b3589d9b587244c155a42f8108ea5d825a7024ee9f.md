The DIEHARD battery of tools, as seen on the Marsaglia random number 
cd published by Dr. Marsaglia of Florida university, a notable figure 
in PRNG design and analysis sounds appropriate for your purposes. It 
performs a number of statistical tests which may be useful, though I 
personally happen not to trust statistical tests to a great extent 
under most circumstances.

If you cannot find these tools after a web search for DIEHARD or 
Marsaglia email me and I will send you a copy...
