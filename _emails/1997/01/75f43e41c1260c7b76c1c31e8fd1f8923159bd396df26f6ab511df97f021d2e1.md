Everytime someone sends a message through White House web site to the
president ( there is a comment form on the site ) it is scanned for
keywords. It probably happens on other key avenues as well.

Of course there are exceptions to every rule. I heard of a woman who wrote
to Clinton something like:
You are such a dynamite leader. I think you have such an explosive
personality, and I'm dying to meet you.

If you want to scan your E-mail, write a little perl script that takes a
list of keywords to scan for, and the action to take when the keywords are
found. It shouldn't be too hard.

			   Just do it!
