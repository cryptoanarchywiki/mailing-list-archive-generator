So you are saying that the Reals are a subset (ie can be constructed from)
of the Rationals?

I can create a number which is not representable by the ratio of two
integers from two numbers which are representable by ratios of two integers?

That's a nifty trick indeed, I am really impressed.

Cauchy produced a test for testing convergence. I fail to see the relevance
here, but please expound...

Dedekind Cut:

"Thus a nested sequence of rational intervals give rise to a seperation of
all rational numbers into three classes."

Just exactly where does this allow us to create Reals?
