You have to admit that it is far more consistent to treat both the
book and the floppy as a munition than to take the position DoS
eventually took. Even if the more consistent position is a far more
restrictive one that has even less chance of surviving a court
challenge.
...........................................................

In terms of consistency, if the government  reserved the right to control 
printed source code (in the future),  and books and floppys containing it 
are considered munitions, then cryptographers, who have it in their heads, 
would also be considered munitions.

They would have to be prohibited from leaving the country and constrained 
not only from using the internet, but from any kind of communications 
medium.  Ian Goldberg would not be allowed to visit Anguilla or participate 
in any more contests.  :>)
