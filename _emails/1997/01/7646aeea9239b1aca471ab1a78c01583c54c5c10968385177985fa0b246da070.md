I pretty much agree.  On the other hand, Ian did a nice job on the
radio (NPR, probably was All Things Considered) of pushing the
"look, if a college student can break 40 bits in a couple of hours,
it's really stupid for the government to limit us like this";
a couple of other people also contributed spin, and it came out
pretty strongly against export restrictions.

I think we do need to get some sort of push going for 3DES as a
replacement for DES - it's strong enough, even though DES is showing
its age, and it's an obvious transition from the current technology.
It's slower and clunkier than IDEA or RC4/128, but still not bad.
