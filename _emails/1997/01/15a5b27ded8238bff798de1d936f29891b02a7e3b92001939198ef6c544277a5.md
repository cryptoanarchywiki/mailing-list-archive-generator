The "enables cryptography" thing just doesn't cut it.  A computer "enables 
cryptography" to a person without a computer.  The MSDOS operating system 
"enables cryptography" to a person with a computer but without an OS.  A 
hard disk with a filesystem "enables cryptography" by providing an 
intermediate data storage location (and format) for encrypted and 
unencrypted data, as well as the encryption program.  Even a modem program 
or mail program "enables cryptography", or at least enables the transmission 
of encrypted data, etc.

Apparently, the phrase "enable cryptography" is either just about 
meaningless, or is so broad as to be not usable to determine which items are 
exportable and which aren't.  How about narrowing it down a bit?
