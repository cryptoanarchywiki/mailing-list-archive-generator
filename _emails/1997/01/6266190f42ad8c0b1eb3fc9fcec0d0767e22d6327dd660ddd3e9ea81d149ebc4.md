In Prizzi's Honor, Nicholson sez "If you try to hide in a submarine on
the bottom of the ocean, we will find you".  But it's not even that
difficult.  Lob a missile into the place and blow it up.  Earth

there's a zillion more.  Does this "rich person" really want to
spend his/her life living in a sealed tomb?
