Hi all,

"The least upper bound of a set of real numbers is often called the
supremum, the greatest lower bound its infimum. In general the supremum and
infimum of a set ARE MEMBERS OF THE SET or at least LIMITS OF SEQUENCES OF
MEMBERS OF THE SET."

[capitalization is mine]

In this case the suprenum is infinity.
