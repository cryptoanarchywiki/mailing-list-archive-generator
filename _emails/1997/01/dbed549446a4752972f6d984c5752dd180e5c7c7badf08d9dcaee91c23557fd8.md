That machine will be the SIXTH model made by a little firm on the thirteenth
floor of an office building.
It will operate on several thousand 6X86 processors.
It will operate either on MSDOS 6.0 or UNIX V6R4, depending on how soon it
is completed.

And it won't be our forearms, we can cover those with sleeves.  It will be
our brow.  (please excuse the spelling).
