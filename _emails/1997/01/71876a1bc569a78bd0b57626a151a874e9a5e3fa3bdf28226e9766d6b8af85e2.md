Dear Pathfinder Free Trial Participant,

Thank you for participating in the free trial offer of Britannica

accessing one of the world's most reliable sources of information
by becoming a subscriber.  For a limited time only Pathfinder
users can purchase Britannica Online at a special discounted rate
-- $14.95 a month or $149 a year.

As a subscriber, you'll enjoy all that Britannica Online has to
offer, from its ease of use... to its in-depth articles... to its
high quality Internet links.  And now with our latest release

Britannica Online 97 includes many new features:

* A spell-checking device that runs automatically when you conduct
  searches and, of course,

In addition to updates for the formal releases (2 or 3 times per
year), Britannica Online articles are updated by our editorial
department as frequently as world events dictate.  Our editors
also select new articles each week to provide you with background
on today's world events.

And don't forget the spotlight features of Britannica Online. Our
recent addition, "The American Presidential Election," has been
updated to include results from the recent election and features
audio clips, presidential and vicepresidential biographies, and
even links to the White House.
