What bothers this control freak is not the chance that something I
might say would end up in his mailbox (he can prevent it, although he
probably lies about having killfiled me), but my ability to speak to
other people interested in what I have to say.  He'd like to stop us
from exchanging private e-mail if he could.

Yes - have you read _Mein Kampf? I once posted an article showing a
great similarity between what Hitler advocated in 1926 and what the
"cypher punks" advocate now - just some quotes in parallel.
