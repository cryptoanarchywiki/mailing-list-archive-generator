If the cpunk list discusses only crypto, then mathematician-programmers
will do their cold work in an isolation which eliminates the need to
think about the consequences of their actions.

So discussions on philosophy, society, etc., are important, to remind
everyone of the context within which this subject operates.

However, if "community feeling" is the only thing created on the list,
and crypto is no longer the focal topic, then what is to be
accomplished: the list will become just a playing ground for wayward
KOTM PhDs who are not welcome in most other cyberspaces.

So the question of "how will this impact society", must maintain
association with "but how does this relate to crypto?".  (unless the
list has changed its stripes, evolving into something completely
different, which many will agree it has).
