Latest versions have an LCD display that reports the type of crypto
being used (3DES), as well as 24 bits worth of SHA-1 of the public
exponentials exchanged.  Alice sends g^x mod p, Bob sends g^y mod p.
Let m = min(g^x mod p, g^y mod p) and n = max(g^x mod p, g^y mod p).
compute v = SHA (concat (OCTET_REP (m), OCTET_REP (n))).  Display the
high 24 bits of v.

Currently, absent some kind of widely deployed public key
infrastructure, there are no signature keys used.  This also means
that the units do *not* contain any long term secrets, just the
session key which is destroyed at the end of the call.
