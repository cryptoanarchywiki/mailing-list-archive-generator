I just sent the following P.S. to newsday.com

			----------------------

There is another reason to have cellular phones which encrypt only the 
over-the-air portion of a call, besides the fact that we can leave normal 
wiretap access procedures in place and not surrender civilian crypto keys to 
the government.

If I have a cellular phone which encrypts over the air (between the phone 
and the base station) and I call you, while you have a normal wired phone, 
our call is protected by cryptography from interception off the air.

If I use an AT&T Clipper-style cellular phone, as David suggested, and I 
call you on a normal wired phone, we can't encrypt the conversation and it 
is vulnerable to interception.  The protection works *only* if both parties 
have encrypting phones while interoperate.
