Please explain what a mode is.  "Mode" usually refers to ECB, CBC, CFB, etc.

Do you have any proof to back this up?

PGP isn't an algorithm.  And RSA 128 is _extremely_ insecure.  How exactly did
you get DES to use a 128-bit key?  Perhaps you used some variant of DES, but
you did not specify.  Also, I'm curious as to why you compare IMDMP, which is
(probably) a symmetric algorithm with public key algorithms.  They really
aren't comparable.

Just because ciphertext passes simple randomness tests does not mean that the
algorithm used to encrypt it is secure.  If ciphertext does not appear to be
random, then the algorithm is not secure.  It doesn't work the other way
around.

Not especially.  I'd still be interested in the design criteria used to develop
this algorithm.  Until you publish the full source and technical data, I will
have to assume that the algorithm is insecure.
