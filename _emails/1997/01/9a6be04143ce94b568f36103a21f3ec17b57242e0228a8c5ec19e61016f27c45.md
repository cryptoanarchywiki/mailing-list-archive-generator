Whom are you asking?  Personally, I use at least 4 remailers for every
message I send.  I have a chain of 3 I trust, and have premail
automatically select a reliable remailer for the last hop.  It may
just be that dhp.com has been high on the list lately.  So a lot of
messages have been coming from there.
