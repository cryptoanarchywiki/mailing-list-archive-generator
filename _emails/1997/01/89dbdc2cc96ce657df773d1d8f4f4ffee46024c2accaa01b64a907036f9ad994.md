Mr. Kasaty, if you want to try robomoderation for scb (which really
reduces the amount of work that you have to do), you can use my bot.

Moderators of soc.culture.russian.moderated are known as some of 
the laziest moderators on USENET, because about 90% of all posts are
approved automatically by the bot.
