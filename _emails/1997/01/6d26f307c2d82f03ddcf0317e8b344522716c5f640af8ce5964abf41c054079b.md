The Federal Trade Commission released yesterday:

"Consumer Privacy on the Global Information Infrastructure" 

   http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/privacy/privacy1.htm

Reuters 1-6-97:

  The Federal Trade Commission, which last year held a conference 
  on privacy issues, said participants at the gathering agreed that 
  businesses have four ways to protect consumer privacy:

  -- Notify consumers about how personal information collected online is
  used.

  -- Give consumers a choice about whether and how their personal
  information is used.

  -- Ensure the security of personal information is protected.

  -- Give consumers access to their own personal information to ensure its
  accuracy.
