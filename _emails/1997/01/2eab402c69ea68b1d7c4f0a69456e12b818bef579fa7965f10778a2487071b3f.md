In this regards you people (en toto) need to do a little more real world
research in this area. Voice recognition is and has been easy to do for
decades. As to what Hollywood is doing, not only are they doing voice
masking but your local radio station does it on a regular basis [1] for a
few $1,000's in hardware and software.
