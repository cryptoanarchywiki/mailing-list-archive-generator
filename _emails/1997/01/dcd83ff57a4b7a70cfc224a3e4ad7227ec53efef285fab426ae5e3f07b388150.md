Eric, would like to require a deposit ($20 was the example he
gave) from subscriber/posters.  Non-subscribers would not be 
allowed to post.  Subscribers who voluntarily left the list, 
would get their deposit back.  Subscribers who flamed twice 
(every dog gets one bite) would be kicked off the list and their 
deposit would be forfeited (or perhaps turned over to the flame 
victim).
