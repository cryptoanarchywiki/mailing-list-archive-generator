It is a bug in the manual :-) The plugins are already installed by the main
installer. If you can't find the buttons in Eudora, it is because they are
in a different location than you think they are.

Look next to the "Queue" button. PGP should make this clearer in their docs.

BTW, I am I the only one who's text does't wrap when emailing to UNIX
boxes? I have wrapping turned on...

Great program, though.
