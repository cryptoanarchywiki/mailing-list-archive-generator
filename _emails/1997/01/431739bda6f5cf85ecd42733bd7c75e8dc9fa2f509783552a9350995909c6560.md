Depends who is doing the filtering? If it's mom and dad keeping you from
looking at naughty pix, maybe.

If it's the gov't keeping you from looking at subversive sites, maybe not:
they'll go out of their way to block such proxies, and in some countries you
could get in hellish trouble for owning such a plug-in.
