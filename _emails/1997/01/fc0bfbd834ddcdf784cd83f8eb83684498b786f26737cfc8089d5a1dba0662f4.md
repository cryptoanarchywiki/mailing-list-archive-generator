Hi Jim, still on your list 8*)

Funny thing is that 3 1/2 hours for a 40 bit search is the "real world"
number I was using two years ago (can look it up in various archives)
so is interesting that the first real test came out exactly the same.

Is why I said 40 bits should not protect anything worth more than U$250.00

Have good reason to believe your estimate for a purpose built machine this
year (expect 600,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 kps per sieve - these will not 
be cheap chips but will be commecially available). Expect 400 arrays
would be required to do DES in a day (average) but is a lot more
achievable than the 65k postulated by the gang of nine.

Still would not be too concerned about using DES so long as every message 
encrypted (including orders for a tuna on rye) and each uses a different
key - is "security by obscurity" in a way but am comfortable with it.

Besides, if really concerned will just superencrypt.

					Warmly,
