Wendy Wallace (I think) has written something about the 4 horsemen of
the Apocalypse, and they've been running excerpts in Paranoia magazine.
I really like Paranoia mag, check it out.

If you like heavy-duty scary symbology writing (can't vouch for the
exact content), check out Texe Marrs who has a recent book on the
subject (can't remember the title, but pictures of the symbols on
the cover, in paperback).
