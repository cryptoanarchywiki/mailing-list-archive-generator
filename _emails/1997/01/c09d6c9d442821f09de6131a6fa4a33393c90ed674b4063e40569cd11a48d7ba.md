To some extent it's bad timing - there's been enough flaming on the
list (including a few bad apples really harassing it) that John Gilmore
decided it was time to start moderating the list, and that's led to
a bunch of flames about moderation.  But it was getting pretty bad.

About a year ago the coderpunks@toad.com list got started;
it's just for discussing code and related issues, not politics.
It's moderated by the "Please be nice, and we'll kick you off for abuse"
method, and it's worked out fine, though it's usually quiet.
Also, a month or two ago, Perry Metzger started cryptography@c2.net ,
which is a bit more general but not for flaming.  Perry moderates it.
Both use -request to find the listbot.
