During the last days the site "Security & Hackerscene" has been
expanded. New sections specialized on intrusion detection, IP-spoofing,
... will help you to protect your site from break-ins and will give you
an insight into the latest methods and tricks used by hackers to break
into obvious secure computers. Furthermore many CERT advisories and
other
security related text files were redesigned and are now available in
HTML
format. You will also find links to the best information resources
(files, e-zines, texts) on the net regarding Internet-Security.
