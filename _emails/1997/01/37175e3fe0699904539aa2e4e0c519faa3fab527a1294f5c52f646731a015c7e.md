  Look on the bright side. Maybe they'll move them around so much that
they'll lose them.

  That is why the thugs and the brown-shirts always start by attacking
scattered individuals and those they can easily brand 'troublemakers.'
(Only in rare instances, do they start with Doctors).
  The intellectuals and academics might, at best, utter a few tut-tut's,
and by the time that the rule of force has become the order of the day,
there is no longer anyone 'below' them left free to object to the
attacks 
on themselves.
