As far as I know, here in Germany (maybe also somewhere else) there is
not the pin stored on the card. Instead, it is regenerated by the ATM
every time using a secret key of the bank. In order to be able to
use the ATM card even with ATMs of different banks, there are offsets
stored on the card that relate to some commonly used pool keys.
