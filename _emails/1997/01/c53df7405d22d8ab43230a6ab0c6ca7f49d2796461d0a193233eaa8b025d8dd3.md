    x=0;
    x1=0;
    x++;
    x--;
  
    Would give you all int's, the only problem you have is granularity. In
practice, there are numbers which you can't get with algorythms, but in 
theory you should be able to hit all real numbers of given granularity (i.e,
10 digits past the decimal point) with the right hardware and software. as in:

    x=0.00000000001;
    y=0.00000000001;
    x1=x;
    x=x+y;
    x1=x1-y;

    Should give you all real numbers with a granularity of 11 digits to the 
right of the decimal point.
