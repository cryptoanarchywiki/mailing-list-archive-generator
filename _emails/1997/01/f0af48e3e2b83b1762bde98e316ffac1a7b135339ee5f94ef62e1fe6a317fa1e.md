as i have writ before, the sources i have read say that 
digits of the transcendentals are THOUGHT to be uniformly
and 'randomly' distributed --- in quotes because there are
many criteria for randomness and i don't mean to imply a 
specific one.  however, this supposision is no stronger
than a conjecture.  has not been proven, AFAIK.
