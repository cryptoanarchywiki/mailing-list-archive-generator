  From view of my own past experience, this seems to be much easier than
lugging all that acetylyne equipment into the bank in the middle of the
night.
  Sounds to me like the people using this scheme need to get ahold of
fuck@yourself.up and get a mailing list of the gullible folks who
ran the executable that he made available to the CypherPunks.
  Perhaps they could combine their projects. First you get the mark's
banking info, then you crash his hard drive to keep him busy while
you drain his account.
