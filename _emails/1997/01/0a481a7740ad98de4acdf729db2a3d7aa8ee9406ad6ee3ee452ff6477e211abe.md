I suggest you read the written resolution of the Oakland school board,
rather than listen to the spin control the district was forced to use after
their idiotic plan blew up in their face.

The resolution finds that "ebonics is the primary language" of a majority
of students in the district. The resolutions then requires teachers to
"provide instructions to students in their primary language".

The school board mandates in writing that at least some classes be taught
in Ebonics (ghetto slang).
