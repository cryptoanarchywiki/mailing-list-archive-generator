Not a bad ideal but I would have to dissagre with adding the information on the subject
line. It would better be put on a x-moderator: line or somthing similar. Adding
information to a subject line adds an extra level of complexity to the end users filtering
process. This has always been a beef with me when lists
modify the subject line.
