We care about his sexual orientation because it supports the
proposition that MOST of the problem people currently on UseNet
are "confirmed" homosexuals.  Here is a list of three of the
biggest problem people, and they are ALL problem people.

J.D. Falk
Peter Berger
John Gilmore

Of course, tale and Chris lewis have not been confirmed as
homosexuals, so the percentage of "homos per.problem humanoids" will
decline.

Nonetheless, the inordinately high percentage of homosexuals in the
newsgroup administration is probably explained by the same social
factors as the extremely high number of jews in the medical and legal
professions and the high number of blacks in sports.
