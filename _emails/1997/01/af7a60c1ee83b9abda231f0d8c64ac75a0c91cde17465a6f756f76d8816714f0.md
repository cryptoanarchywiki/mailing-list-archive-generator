First, I did not use it as a legal term of art, so a legal 
dictionary is not appropriate.  Second, I see no sustantive 
difference between "forejudgment" and my shorthand version 
(pre-judge).  Third, I wrote "literal."  Examine the etimology of 
the word for it's literal meaning.  It's pretty obvious AND
specific [ME.; OFr, /prejudice/ (Fr. /prejudice/); L praejudicium/,
from /prae/, before, and /judicium/, a judgment, from /judex/,
/judicgis/, a judge.]  In other words, to pre-judge.  Get it?

I have no intention nor duty to satisfy everyone.  That is not
possible.  I will use a "reasonable person" test.  (I am, by the 
way, using this in the legal term of art sense.)

Other folks on this list seem to have other opinions.  That's why
there are horse races.  I don't like it, but Toto are free to 
wallow in it if he chooses.

Somehow, I don't think that will be a problem, as this debate 
has demonstrated.

I totally agree with this not-full-of-shit position.  Toto and I,
unlike some others, seem to agree on the importance of crypto.
We only seem to have a problem with how best to discuss the 
issues.  It's a start.

P.S.	I talked to Gilmore about the holdup in getting
	started.  He has been too busy to get the tech
	side going, but when he does, (a) everyone will
	be notifed as to the start date, and the test
	will still run for an entire month.  Until then,
	it is (sadly) business as usual.
