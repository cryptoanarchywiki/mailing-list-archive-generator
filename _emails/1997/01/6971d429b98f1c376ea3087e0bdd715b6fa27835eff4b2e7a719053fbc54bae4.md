Thank you!  And a Happy New Year to you too.

I remember seeing an old Library of Congress transliteration table where jat'
was transliterated as e with some accent, and dotted i was an i with some
accent. I took a quick look on my shelf and can't find it now. (LOC is not
a good scheme, since one can't always recover the original from it. :-)

The U.S.G. Printing Office manual seems to suggest that one translates into
the new orthography before transliterating (fita to f, dotted i and izhitsa
to i, yat' to e or yo). This may lead to an occasional problem: suppose you
have an index alphabetized according to the old rules:

ib..
ik... (regular i)
ia...
ie... (dotted i before another vowel)

If you fold dotted i into i, you'll be looking for 'ia' before 'ib'.
Ditto for yat', which came much later than e in the collating sequence.
