    Third (as Mr. Vulis <insult deleted> observed) the jump from using poor 
crypto to using good crypto is a lot shorter than not using crypto to 
using good crypto. 

    Once people get it in there heads that crypto is good to use, then 
it is easier to convince them to use "unbreakable" crypto than to convince 
non-crypto-users.
