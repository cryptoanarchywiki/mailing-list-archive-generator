I suggest you subscribe to cypherpunks-unedited. It may go away, but
for now it's much more interesting than the censored version.

Thanks to the moderation, only one side of the issue gets aired anyway.

The "politically correct" homosexuals, like snow and gilmore and sandfart
consider (violent) action to be a reasonable response to speech they don't like
(e.g. "homophobic") - not "more speech". Someone says something you disagree
with on a mailing list? Unsubscribe him! Ban him from the list! Institute
moderation to auto-discard everything he says! Curiously, African-American
children are taught that violence is a correct response to "racist" speech.

When they run out of things to say, they start pulling plugs,
unsubscribing people, and "moderating"...

I can answer this one, having worked for Jesuits: having deviant sexual desires
may not be a choice, but willingly committing unnatural acts to satisfy your
deviant desires is a choice.

And when the namecalling doesn't work, they respond with violence.
