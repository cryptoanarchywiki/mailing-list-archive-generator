No, that's not what he is saying.  What you have written does not represent 
a *specific* number.  He is saying that IF you have a particular scheme for 
representing *specific* numbers, you can only represent countably many 
-- for any given scheme, there are numbers you can't represent. 

To put it another way a scheme that says "you can represent numbers 
as half infinite strings of digits with a single period somewhere" 
doesn't actually *specify* any numbers.  A scheme that says "start 
with the number 1 and increment it 400 times" actually specifies a 
number.

To be a formal system of the type required, you would also have to 
specify deterministic rules that could generate the "Ai" values.  The 
key distinction is between "expressed by" and "generated by".
