The best answer you can possibly give him is to move production overseas.
Any 40 bit cipher is garbage. Period. It is easy to produce crypto
overseas. Many medium sized companies are doing so today. Insiders claim
that larger companies, such as Netscape, are in the process of setting up
shop abroad as well.

Clearly, one can't produce software containing crypto in the US and stay
competitive at the same time.
