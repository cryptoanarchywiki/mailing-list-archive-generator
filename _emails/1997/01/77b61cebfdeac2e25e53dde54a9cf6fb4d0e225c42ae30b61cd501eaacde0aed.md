Wait a second, isn't that what you were just calling for in my case?

To wit: "I suggest zero tolerance of Black Unicorn unless and until
someone reveals his real name."

For the guy who has been screaming his head off about censorship to the 
point of nausea you were sure quick to turn your coat in my case.  That
more than anything else you have ever said puts the cap on your 
credibility as far as I'm concerned.
