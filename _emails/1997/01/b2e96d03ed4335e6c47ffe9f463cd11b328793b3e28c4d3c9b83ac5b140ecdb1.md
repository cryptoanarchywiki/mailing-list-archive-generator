Jim, either you are full of shit or that Law is VERY
unconstitutional.  The first amendment prohibits any Criminal Laws
from being made against libel.

Being able to defame somebody is clearly within Freedom of speech.
The only thing that is illegal in this Country is any speech proposing
the killing of any President, and we can live with that.  Nothing else
is ever prohibited by the Criminal Law.

Your only remedy for defamation of any kind is a civil Lawsuit.
