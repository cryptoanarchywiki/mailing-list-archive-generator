The list only suffers when you guys stop posting crypto/political
info.  For example, if tomorrow there are 100 new posts, and 10 of
them are crypto/political relevant, and 10 more are like this one
(I'm ignoring the other 80 for this example), then the list is only
10% relevant.  Take away these 10, and it's 11.1%, but 10 less posts
to read.  Turn these 10 into something relevant, and voila(!), the
list is now 20% relevant.

You see, it's up to you, Bill.
