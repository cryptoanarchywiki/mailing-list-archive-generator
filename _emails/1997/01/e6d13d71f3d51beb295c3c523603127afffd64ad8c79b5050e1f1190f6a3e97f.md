OK, I've now sent THREE requests to majordomo to get off this list.. I got
a reply back 4 hours ago saying I was off, and the next two said I wasn't
a member of the list.  Interesting list (minus the spamcrap obviously) and
I think the moderation will be a good thing, BUT the 20 emails I've received
in the last 4 hours (since I 'officially' unsubbed) is (to say the least) far
more than I (or any reasonable mortal) can deal with.

How do I unsubscribe?  No, more importantly, how do I stop all these damn
emails turning up?

Thanks in Advance

Simon


  As I think, talk, and act.. so I shall become..
