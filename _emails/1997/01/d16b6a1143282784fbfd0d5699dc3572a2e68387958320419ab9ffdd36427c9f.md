Any bets on whether the $5000 RC5-12/32/6 contest will be solved 
before the www.rsa.com contest status web page is updated?  :-)

Or how long before someone in the government starts talking about
how 56 bits takes 65,000 times as long to solve as 40 bits, 
which is 26 years for a whole building full of computers,
and even 48 bits ought to take a month and a half for a whole
building full of computers (or supercomputers, if they hype it up....)?

which was a bit slower than Ian Goldberg's crack, but pretty close.
How many machines were you using, on average?
