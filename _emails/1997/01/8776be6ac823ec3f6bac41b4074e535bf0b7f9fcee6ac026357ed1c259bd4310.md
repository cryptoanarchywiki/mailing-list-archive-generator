Is there a way to disable the \WINDOWS\PGPW_32.LOG?
In subtle ways it's a security hole if left to accumulate over time,
since it keeps records of which keys you encrypted messages to.

(Imagine somebody using an anonymous remailer but g-d forbid is 
unaware of this log file, and somebody discovers that messages were 
encrypted to such a beast...)

I understand in certain group/corporate environs one would want 
logging; in others, one doesn't need it or should have the option (in 
an easily found place) to wipe it every once in a while.
