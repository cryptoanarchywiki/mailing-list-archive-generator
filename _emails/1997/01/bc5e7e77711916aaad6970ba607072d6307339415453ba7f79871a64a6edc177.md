Well, I can't speak for R.H., but in my own case, my KILLfile entries
typically look like

	/toto/f:=:j

which displays the subject lines as it junks the articles.  Sometimes
I'll see one go by which interests me, so I'll go back and read it
anyway.

Similarly, people who've been plonked are often quoted in somebody
else's message, so I see it anyway.
