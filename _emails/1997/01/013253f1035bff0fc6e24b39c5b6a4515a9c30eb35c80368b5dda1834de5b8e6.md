Well the obvious answer seems to me to stop majordomo at toad.com 
accepting ANY messages from anonymous sources but let pseudonyms 
post, pseudonymous posting allows the owner of the nym to accumulate 
reputation capital without disclosing his or her true identity.

Bear in mind of course that this is a purely technical answer and I 
happen not to believe that anonymous posting should be stopped.
