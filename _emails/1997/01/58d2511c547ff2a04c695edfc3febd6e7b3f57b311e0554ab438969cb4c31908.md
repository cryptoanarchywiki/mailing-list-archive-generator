  In any war, whether 'just' or 'unjust' (or 'both'), the 'grunts' on
the
line, by very nature of their position, are cannon fodder, whether they
are their because of their ideals, or as a result of conscription.
  It is a sad fact that, even in a war where the main focus is the
fight for ideals that the common soldier is willing to sacrifice 
for, the 'powers that be' always seem to be ready, willing and able
to throw away a few 'extra' lives in order to increase the size of
their political 'cock', or to garner a few headlines.
  And when the war is over, the only thing that everyone can agree on
seems to be the 'body count'.  That's war.
