After following this thread for some time, I have to question whether
Americans realise how far behind the rest of the world they are in
cellphone technology.

Most of the world has been using GSM digital technology for some years
now, with automatic international roaming, unless you travel to the USA.
No one in their right mind uses an analogue mobile phone any more if they 
are concerned about eavesdropping.  The Newt incident simply could not 
happen with GSM.

Of course in most countries the government controls the federal police, 
not the other way round.
