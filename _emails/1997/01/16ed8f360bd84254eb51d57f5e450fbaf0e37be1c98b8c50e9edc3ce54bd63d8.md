I said we shouldn't waste time analyzing the moderator twit's irrelevant
actions, but I do want to point out how amusing this is: Sandy sends all
the rebuttals of "homophobic" posts to the censored list, while junking
the "homophobic" posts themselves.  Of course, none of this homosexual
garbage is crypto-relevant, but it was submitted by the "right people".
