What started this thread off was Lucky Green's observation of the beerkegs
getting through the security checkpoints at the Oakland Airport.

Just yesterday I flew from Seattle's Sea-Tac Airport to Oakland, on 
Southwest Airlines.  My partner and I were (we thought) checking in just
in time to  be in the second boarding group. (Explanation of Southwest's
lo-tech allocation of seat choice elided).  An unacompanied woman was
the next person ahead of us in the line.

She presented the gate agent with *four* tickets and *four* IDs.  "Where
are these other people?" the agent asked.  "They're parking the car,"
said the traveler.  The agent gave her all four boarding passes; and my
companion and I were bumped to the third boarding group.

The woman in front of us was white and middle-class-looking, traveling
with what appeared to be her family.  One wonders what would have
happened were she a swarthy man wearing robes and a burnoose.  Or if she
were just wearing shabby clothes.
