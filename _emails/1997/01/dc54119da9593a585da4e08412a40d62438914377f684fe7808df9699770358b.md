Using GSM would add protection against casual eavesdroppers, but would
not provide that high a degree of protection.

GSM encrypts only the links to the station - the traffic goes in the
clear through the station.  Plus A5 (crypto algorithm used in GSM) is
weak, 40 bits of effective key space.

It could be worse to have poor crypto, than no crypto,
