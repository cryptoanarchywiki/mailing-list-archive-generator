Actually, I thought he summed up the anti-GAK positions reasonably well,
though he didn't elaborate on them. The "it may not work all the time"
statement was actually an admission of the pro-GAK side.

I found the logic questionable, but more disturbing was the fundamental
position that "loss of privacy [...] is a price that must be paid to
gain security".  Benjamin Franklin's statement about security and
freedom comes strongly to mind when I hear nonsense like this.  He then
cites the (in "our" view, useless and intrusive) hassles that airline
passengers must endure in the name of "security" as justification for
more of the same!  Talk about a slippery slope!

It is, at http://www.newsday.com/mainnews/rnmi0522.htm

Pretty disappointing stuff, but then Mr. Kahn IS affiliated with the NSA
these days, isn't he?
