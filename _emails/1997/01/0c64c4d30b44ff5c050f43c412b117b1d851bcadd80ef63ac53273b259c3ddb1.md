Pick up a copy of the Johnson Smith Catalog, lots of fun to read and they
sell t-shirts with greys on them.
The catalog sells several "contriversial" books and tapes, including psycic
healing techniques, astral projection, the infamous alien autopsy tape, and
several books about and works by Tesla, including one specifically about the
device that you are talking about.
On another thread, pick up the Cheek3 Scanner modification guide while your
at it, I hear that it is a good resource.
