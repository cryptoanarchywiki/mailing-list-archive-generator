   Like skillfully moving the CypherPunks subscribers onto a different
 list than the one they subscribed to? Knowing that most subscribers
 would 'take' whatever was spoon-fed to them?
   I have the utmost respect for John's skill in manipulating the
 majority of CypherPunks subscribers into a pen from which they
 can leisurely munch on the fodder that Sandy throws over the fence
 to them. I am sure that they will grow 'fat' on the condensed
 crypto-food that is provided for them, especially since they
 will not have to move about in order to graze among all of the
 postings.
   But I am reminded of a Sunday-school teacher who told her class
 the story of the Prodigal Son, and afterwards asked one of the
 children, "Who was not happy to see the Prodigal Son return home?"
   He replied, "The fatted calf."
