Yes, Dale, let's

Sounds reasonable to me, especially contact with germs (Who says "germs?"), and sexual contact. Take it on the road, Dale.

Yes, nebulous! Extraordinaire (on average), certainly.

At the risk of being offed by the moderator, I do believe that Dale is masturbating when he writes nonsense such as this. Perhaps "masterbating" as opposed to j.o. will pass muster.

Dale makes an excellent case for having a moderated list right here. What do his nutball beyond-the-fringe remarks have to do with crypto, privacy, security? Cripes, in the old days even an _accurate_ off-list remark would open a blast furnace of condemnation, a la Jim B.

If the list won't moderate itself to "guide" the Dale's, it DESERVES to be moderated. 

He's gotta be trolling to keep it hard. (Dangerous ground here!) Read "erect" for "keep it hard."

I suggest even (even!) "Dr.Dimitri Vulis KOTM" would disavow this pseudo-scientific nonsense regardless of his stated feelings toward homosexuals which I do not share but, nevertheless, believe may be aired.

Step up, Doc.

P.S. Does tripe such as Dale's latest make the mod list?
