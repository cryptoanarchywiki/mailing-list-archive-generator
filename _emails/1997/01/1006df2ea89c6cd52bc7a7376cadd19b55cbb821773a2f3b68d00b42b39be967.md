I knew that when I wrote this, but the fact that Vulis has been 
banned from the list is most definitely censorship and has lowered 
the philiosophy of the list (as in original purpose and ideaology) to 
a lower plane and provoked a number of flame wars which would 
otherwise have not taken place.

I noticed this too but it was not what I was referring to.
