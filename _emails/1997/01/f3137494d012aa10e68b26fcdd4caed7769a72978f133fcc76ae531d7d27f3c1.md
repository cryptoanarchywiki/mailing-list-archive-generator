Hi all,

I am motivated to post this, something I would normaly not do, because of
the issue of trust of moderators that has arisen lately.

Igor and myself were in a discussion about number theory last nite. We
reached a point of impass. Igor made the suggestion that we bring the
discussion to cpunks. I requested that we drop the issue and specificaly not
bring it to cpunks. My reasoning had several facets. First, the position that
I was in is probably wrong. My motivation was to examine the methodology of
dis-proof (which I was disappointed with). Also, it is not a serious issue
with me and whether my particular view is right or wrong is irrelevant.
Cypherpunks is not the place for truly technical discussions (as is apparent
with even a cursory glance). Traffic on this list practicaly drowns my
ability to filter it and more drivel I (and probably you) don't need. And
finaly, the discussion was fine for a Saturday afternoon discussion, I don't
have the interest or time to carry it out over days or weeks, I have to work
for a living.

Igor agreed to drop the issue and not to bring it to the list. However, this
morning I find Secret Squirrel posting some questions which are taken
practicaly verbatin from my exchange w/ Igor. Seemed like a truly improbable
event.

Take it for what it's worth.
