I would argue that it is the people, not the governments, that don't want a 
common currency in Europe.  Of course it's a different story with the poor EU 
countries....

But digital currencies will never become fiat currencies, let alone legal 
tender, unless governments say they are.  So why should they worry?  (OK, OK, 
they will worry about tax evasion etc. etc.)

You seem to be forgetting that trade is a two way operation.

I doubt this - I'm sure companies as well as people are more inclined to trust 
some private organisations than they are governments.  Of course there will 
always be a cost attached to the risk and ease of use.

Since you mentioned Greenspan, I thought I'd use the opportunity to quote him:

  "Regulation - which is based on force and fear - undermines the moral base
  of business dealings. It becomes cheaper to bribe a building inspector than
  to meet his standards of construction. A fly-by-night securities operator
  can quickly meet all the S.E.C. requirements, gain the inference of
  respectability, and proceed to fleece the public. In an unregulated
  economy, the operator would have had to spend a number of years in
  reputable dealings before he could earn a position of trust sufficient to
  induce a number of investors to place funds with him. Protection of the
  consumer by regulation is thus illusory."

Likewise.
