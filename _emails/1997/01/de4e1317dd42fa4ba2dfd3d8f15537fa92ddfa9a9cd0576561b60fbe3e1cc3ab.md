If you can honestly say you think that Dimitri agreed to his being 
unsubscribed and not being allowed to re-subscribe then I concede the 
point, however, you cannot argue this.

My point is not that moderating a private forum is censorship, this 
is not supposed to be a private forum (if at any point John chooses 
to make it so that is his right as the list is his property, however, 
he professes, at least in a collective sense along with the other 
list founders, that it is a free and anarchic list where people would 
not be prevented from posting whatever they want, censorship in this 
context (call it moderation of you like) seems to me out of place)).

The list is indeed a private forum and I resent the term sophistry. 
My interpretation of the lists original purpose and idealogy is 
clearly different from your own so we are arguing the wrong point.
My interpretation is that the list was supposed to act as a community 
as much as a forum and is therefore erring to the side of a nation 
state as opposed to private property, even though, when we come down 
to it it is someones property..
