According to my AIDS database, a possible reason for the "hotly
debated" theories of Duesberg is that because of the suspicion
falling on the govt. and the WHO in regard to creating the HIV
virus, the govt. was happy to have Duesberg and ilk deflecting
a lot of that criticism.  This doesn't make Duesberg wrong by
implication, but there were suggestions of disinformation....
