Cypherpunks:

A January 1997 physical DC Cypherpunks meeting will be held at GRC
International, Inc., in Vienna, Virginia, on Saturday, 18 January. 
Directions to GRCI, including a couple of spiffy-neato maps, are available
at:  http://www.grci.com/overview/locations/vienna/

If you're in town for the inauguration (yes, it's the following Monday),
then stop by and check out the East Coast "punks" contingent. 

Meeting starts at 1400 hours (2:00 PM).  You will be entering a secured
facility and will have to endure the usual rigors of being badged,
exchanging pleasantries with the guard, and being limited to "requires
escort" status.  So, allow a few minutes extra before the meeting starts. 

Agenda includes a presentation by Carl Ellison, Senior Systems Engineer
from CyberCash, Inc.  Ad-hoc additions are welcome - show up with your
presentation materials and you're automatically added to the agenda.  We
even have a historical crypto-relevant door prize to be given away at the
meeting!  (Assuming you can haul it home <g>)

GRCI is located at the corner of Gallows Road and Boone Blvd, about two
miles north of the Dunn-Loring Metro station on the western end of the
orange line.  As solicitations for rides haven't appeared (yet) on the
list, the assumption is that they're being coordinated off-list at the
moment.  If your ride fails you and you're stuck at the Metro on Saturday,
the phone number for where we'll be meeting is 703.506.4951.  We can
try to beg you a ride from some gracious punk with wheels.  The front
desk is 703.506.5000 or 4000, is there's no answer downstairs.

If you show up late for the meeting and there's nobody there to sign you
in, you'll have to have the guard call us.  We'll be downstairs in the
"lower level conference room."  Just say those words and s/he'll know
where we are.  S/he can then call and someone will come up to get you.

Post-meeting world-problem-solving and beer-swilling activities
can be undertaken in any of the numerous suitable locations in and
about the illustrious Tyson's Corner locale.  We'll coordinate at
the end of the meeting.

Hope to see y'all this Saturday!
