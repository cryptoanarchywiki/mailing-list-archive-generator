I've just started clipping and saving the characters w/o the text
that accompanies them.  I've got a dozen so far, so check back in
a week or so and I'll forward a set to anyone who wants.  Unless,
of course, someone has a bucket of them now.

BTW, some of the recent ones are pretty amazing: a bat, a scorpion,
a cow, etc.
