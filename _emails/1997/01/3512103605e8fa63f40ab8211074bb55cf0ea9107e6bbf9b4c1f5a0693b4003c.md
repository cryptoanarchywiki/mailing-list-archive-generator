A cypher with a long key setup schedule, such as Blowfish, would be more
resistant to brute force attacks.  (Blowfish requires 500+ encryptions to
set up the key schedule.  This should be similar to adding 9 bits to the
key size.)  While I think Blowfish is good in this respect, one must be
careful to avoid systems, such as DES, which are subject to Peter Trei's
"gray code" techniques.
