Ok. I admit it. It is beneath me, but how could I resist such temptation?

Eww.

(1)     Not possible, you need real-world entropy. Sadly, there is
	yet there is no platform independent way to efficiently
	collect it.

(2)     For symmetric ciphers, keylengths over 128 bits do not gain
	you anything - unless the cipher is poorly written and does
	not use all of its keyspace or leaks bits of the keyspace
	into the ciphertext. 2^128 is such an immense number that
	short of a fundamental change in complexity theory, exhaustive
	keysearching a 2^128 keyspace will never be a possible
	attack scenario, regardless of increases in computation
	speed.

(3)	"256 byte (1024) bit keys". Hmm. 256 x 8 = 2048

(4)	"5 byte (40 bit) keys". 5 x 8 = 40 and

(5)	Says (4) is to comply with ITAR. But...

(6)	"50 bits so as to comply with the latest ITAR details."

(7)	Find the oxymoron.

(8)	You're wrong.

(9)	That "irrashional" spelling, at it again.

(10)	Then why is he still writing?
