US Senator Will Reintroduce Encryption Export Bill

   WASHINGTON - Sen. Conrad Burns will reintroduce next week his measure
   to substantially eliminate export restrictions on computer encoding
   technology, a spokesman for the Senator says.
   
   "We are aiming for the 28th (of January) and it will be the same bill
   as last year," Matt Raymond, spokesman for the Montana Republican,
   said.
   
   President Clinton signed an executive order in November slightly
   relaxing export controls on encryption technology -- computer programs
   that use mathematical formulas to scramble information and render it
   unreadable without a password or software "key."
   
   But many in Congress and the computer industry have said the new
   Clinton policy did not go far enough to lift the Cold War era export
   limits that classified most encryption programs as munitions.
