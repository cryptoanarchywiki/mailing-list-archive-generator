Well, I don't know who you are, so (despite your remarks) I can't
really tell what your question is.  I suppose if we sat down with a
human moderator and a copy of Applied Cryptography, you'd know the
XOR's and S-boxes and whatnot better than I.  That's why we need
people like you on this list, especially the moderated list, since
you know the conventional (academic) crypto really well.  To be
honest, I'm after more important things, but hey, keep plugging away
and maybe I'll learn something from you.  Hugs and stuff....
