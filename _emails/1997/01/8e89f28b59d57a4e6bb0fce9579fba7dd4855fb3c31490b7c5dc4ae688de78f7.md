Congratulations. You are now successfully registered with Nature on the
World-Wide Web -- the world's most popular on-line science journal.

Don't forget Nature on-line is updated weekly every Thursday with the very
latest events information, table of contents, jobs, news and much more.
While on-line, your registration details can also be used to request extra
information free from advertisers.

Your free registration allows you access at http://www.nature.com , as well
as Nature's US mirror site at http://www.america.nature.com (the information
there is exactly the same, but it offers faster access if you're based in 
the Americas). If you can read Japanese and if your machine is Kanjii-enabled,
you will also find Nature's Japanese gateway site at http://www.naturejpn.com .

If you ever forget your password, there's no need to re-register. Just e-mail
registration@nature.com with your name/e-mail address, and we'll look up
your details and confirm your password/username.

Also, please rest assured that your information is treated as confidential. It
is held on our secure server and will never be sold or traded to any other
company, organisation or individual.

We are constantly adapting Nature's award-winning site to keep it the first
choice for the scientific community. Your suggestions and feedback are always
much appreciated, and you may e-mail them to feedback@nature.com .

We look forward to seeing you back at the Nature site soon.

Yours sincerely,

Stephen Hunt
Nature Web Site
