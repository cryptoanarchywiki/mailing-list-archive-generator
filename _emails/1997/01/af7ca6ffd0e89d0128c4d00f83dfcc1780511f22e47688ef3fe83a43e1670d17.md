                AMERICAN REGISTRY FOR INTERNET NUMBERS PROPOSAL
{chop}
   
   Below is the proposed plan for the organization structure and fee
   schedule. The organization will have more detailed bylaws which will
   be ratified by the Board of Trustees.
_________________________________________________________________
   
   An annual membership fee of $1,000 will be charged to all entities
   joining the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). Membership
   is open to any entity/individual wishing to join, regardless of
   whether the entity/individual receives address space directly from
   ARIN. Membership is not a requirement for receiving address space from
   ARIN.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  SECTION 2.3 ISP REGISTRATION FEE
   
   If an ISP moves from a Small to a Medium category (for example) in the
   same year, the ISP will be charged the difference.
   
   Small $2500/year /24 - /19 Medium $5000/year >/19 - /16 Large
   $10K/year >/16 - /14 X-Large $20K/year >/14
   
================================
Anyone care to calculate the total dollars?
