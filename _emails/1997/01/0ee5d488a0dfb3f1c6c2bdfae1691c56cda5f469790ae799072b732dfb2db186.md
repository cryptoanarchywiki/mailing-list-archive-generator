(at http://www.l0pht.com/~drwho/cell/texts/thorn1192.txt)

To calm fears that cellular calls were not private, the cellular
industry lobbied congress into passing legislation known today as the
Electronic Communication Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986 which makes it a crime
to monitor cellular phone calls and a host of other transmissions like
digital pagers.  This law is used by cellular equipment dealers and 
service providers to reassure customers that their conversations will 
remain private.
