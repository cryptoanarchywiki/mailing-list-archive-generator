Just one thing about the names of the different lists:
I received a mail listing the changes to come.
It was very easy to understand that I am going to get the moderated list
if I do not change my subscription.I'll find out if I will miss something.
We'll see.
I wonder who is so brainless, not to understand what's going on.
Do you really think the subscribers are pure Idiots?
