neither has "beat" the other at this point. but this does show something
I have always believed: companies should just invent ad-hoc, quick-and-dirty
standards if full standards are not immediately available. it makes no
sense to me to delay the introduction of some new feature because there
isn't industry standardization. the case is often that the initial 
ad-hoc standards will tend to converge into a better standard down
the road. I don't see standards as "forever". standards should be
viewed as stepping stones to better standards. 

hence I think netscape and/or MS should invent a "plug and play" 
(i.e. trivial to use) micropayment standard immediately, regardless
of what industry standardization does not or will exist. it wouldn't
be pretty at first but standardization to better interfaces could
ensue later. the main thing is to get it on the table, and get
people using it, to create the demand. services are rarely developed
unless there is a demand. hence I suggest that a *rudimentary* form
of the service be first devised and implemented asap to increase
demand for one with much more finesse.

  In its early

exactly.

don't think this is a valid question. the whole point of microcurrency
is just decreasing the cost until people hit the page and don't
care about the cost. hence I think there is a guaranteed market, because
with microcurrency you can always shave off your price to virtually
infinitesmal values (say pennies a hit) that will guarantee you will
have at least some audience.

  Do web service operators think they can offer value added
>services which will motivate customers to click through the for-pay link?

I'm imagining just putting a teeny little transaction charge on top
of every single hit that now exists. if it is small enough, consumers
won't care very much.

well, pick one payment scheme and then competing companies could
adopt the same standard (but offer competing systems and features)

exactly. someone who reengineered the whole thing from top to
bottom and made it absolutely trivial to use-- I suspect the future
of the browser wars will belong to the company that does this.
again, I note it might be doable in a plug in, but as I said, I 
think browser manufacturers are eventually going to put it into 
their own code because of its sheer importance.
