http://jya.com/bxa123096.txt has the Federal Register text
of the interim export administration rules.  I haven't waded through
all the comparisons of which interim amends what paragraph of what subplot
of the revised prohibitions, etc., but there's one paragraph that 
may be relevant to the SWAN project.
        "This interim rule also amends part 744 to add a general prohibition
        in Sec. 744.9 with respect to technical assistance in the development
        or manufacture abroad of encryption commodities and software controlled
        for EI reasons and makes conforming changes throughout the EAR."

Lucky Green has been talking with Commerce to try to get
clarification of some of the requirements on a related issue;
they say not to worry about some of the paragraphs because they
only apply to missiles, nukes, and similar Real Munitions,
but the paragraph above sounds like it's still talking about crypto.
I'm not sure if "technical assistance" is clearly defined, 
and I'm not sure if hiring some foreigner to build something for _you_
counts as providing technical assistance to _them_, but it makes
it more difficult to do the right thing while debugging non-US systems.
