-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

PGPMail 4.5 is now available for ordering from PGP Inc.  

If you have Digicash or a credit card, you can order from the home page.  (I
would not recommend the credit card option though.  The form claims that it
is encrypted with SSL, but the info will be sent in the clear.  Someone needs
to have a talk with their web master...  This is not the first security
problem with their pages.)

In using the betas, I have been pretty impressed.  It works with Eudora
seamlessly.  (Enough that I did not notice that it had installed itself
automatically instead of having to do a seperate install as the documentation
claimed.)  The program beats out any of the plug-ins and front-ends for
integrating PGP and e-mail that I have seen yet.  And for $29.95 for PGP
2.6.2 users, well worth the price...

Disclaimer:
I have no financial stake in PGP Inc, not do I have controling interest in
the financial affairs of Mr. Zimmerman, liens on the souls of the damned,
control of the Aluminum Bavariati, eyes as big as my stomach, or the rites to
reproduce the descriptions of major league baseball games without permission
of the commisioner of Gotham City.
