The L.A. Times today (Wed) ran an article telling about three top
lab people working on the OKC bombing case, and how they were moved
or scuttled due to discrepancies.  This was a new development.

You'll note also that although Fujisaki (sp?) in the 2nd O.J. trial
did not permit it to be introduced (to my knowledge), there was
evidence that a high-up FBI lab person who testified in the first
trial falsified or seriously distorted certain facts to help the
prosecution.  This may yet be pursued like the Fuhrman thing.
