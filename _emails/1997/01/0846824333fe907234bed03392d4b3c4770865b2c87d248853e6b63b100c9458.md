Thanks to David Wagner and Steve Schear, we've learned about the
latest documents on cellular encryption which supercede the
1992 CAVE document, Appendix A to IS-54, which contained the CAVE 
algorithm. Here are the latest, followed by ordering information.

  TIA/EIA/IS-136.1-A -- TDMA Cellular/PCS - Radio Interface -
  Mobile Station - Base Station Compatibility - Digital Control
  Panel, October, 1996, 372 pp. $350.00.

  Addendum No. 1 to IS-136.1-A, November, 1996, 40 pp. Free.

  TIA/EIA/IS-136.2-A -- TDMA Cellular/PCS - Radio Interface -
  Mobile Station - Base Station Compatibility - Traffic Channels
  and FSK Control Channel, October, 1996, 378 pp. $310.00.

  TIA/EIA-627 -- 800 MHZ Cellular System, TDMA Radio Interface, 
  Dual-Mode Mobile Station - Base Station Compatibility
  Standard, June, 1996, 258 pp. $120.00.

These documents can be ordered from:

  Global Engineering Documents
  15 Inverness Way East
  Englewood, Colorado 80112
  Telephone: 1-800-854-7179

However, each of the documents lists the following related 
supplements which contain "sensitive information" and may be 
obtained by US/CA citizens from TIA by signing a Non-Disclosure 
Agreement and acceptance of export restrictions:

  Appendix A to IS-136.

  Appendix A to 627.

  Common Cryptographic Algorithms.

  Interface Specification for Common Cryptographic Algorithms.

These controlled documents can be requested by calling Ms. Sharon
Vargish at 1-703-907-7702, who will fax an NDA, and upon receipt of
the completed form, will send the controlled documents at no cost.

Here's the NDA:

         AGREEMENT ON CONTROL AND NONDISCLOSURE OF
              COMMON CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS
          REVISION A TO IS-54, IS-95, AND IS-136
      [Note: 627 supercedes IS-54; IS-95 is for CDMA]

       (typed name)

subject documents represent valuable, proprietary and confidential

ITAR.
