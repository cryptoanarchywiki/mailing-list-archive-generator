Good grief...I just remembered that this challenge started today when I 
read this letter.  A question - how does DES differ from the RC5 cyphers

If you need to know how to set up a mail filter or defend against 
emailbombs, send me a message with the words "get helpfile" (without the 
" marks) in the SUBJECT: header, *NOT THE BODY OF THE MESSAGE!*  I have 
several useful FAQs and documents available.
