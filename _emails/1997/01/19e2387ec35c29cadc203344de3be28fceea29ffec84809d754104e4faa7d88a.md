I have a feeling that you are missing the point. The point of AP 
is not to bet on whether a certain event will occur or not. The point 
is that only a person who really makes it happen (assassinates someone)
will know enough to get the money.

All other betters who do NOT intend to bring the event about will
expect to lose money, because they will not be able to make a
sufficiently good prediction.

It is not a bookie system, it is a collective anonymous hire-a-hitman 
scheme.

Yuor suggestion about trying a demo about homophobic posts is good, BUT
what needs to be added to make it a good demo is a danger for the poster
to lose an account. I.e., the requirement to such a homophobic post should
be that 1) it should be PGP signed by a real person and 2) it should 
have a correct return address.

Any fool can send an anonymous message, and that would have no 
educational value and no value for the AP demo.
