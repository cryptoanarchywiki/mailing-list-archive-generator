Well, in the week or two since resubscribing to Cypherpunks, I've seen a
trickle of postings about cryptography, security, and privacy, and a flood
of insults, harangues, fighting words, and so on.  Some of this reads more
like a script from a Jerry Falwell TV spot than anything I recognize as
"Cypherpunk" traffic.

I don't care who's offended whom.  I'm not interested in participating in a
forum where the supposed topic is submerged underneath a lot of adolescent
alpha primate chest-beating.

I'm off to look for a mailing list where people are ACTUALLY DISCUSSING
CRYPTOGRAPHY AND IMPLEMENTING CRYPTOSYSTEMS.  This list may still be
called "cypherpunks", but it doesn't have much cypherpunk left in it, as
far as I can tell.

Disgusted,
