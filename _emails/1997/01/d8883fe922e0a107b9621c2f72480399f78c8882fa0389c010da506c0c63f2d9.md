Just coincidentally, these errors imprison the innocent instead of
freeing the guilty.

Why not "proving their innocence"?  A prosecutor - and one who does
not respect our legal tradition of presumed innocence - is not a good
choice for a quote here.

Nowhere in the entire article is there evidence that the reporters
talked to anyone outside the FBI/Justice Department milieu.

Why isn't this the story?  FBI agents regularly committed perjury, and
we see a story about lab errors.
