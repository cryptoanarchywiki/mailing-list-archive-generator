Postal Service offers $25,000 reward for stolen . . . something

By ARNOLD MARKOWITZ Herald Staff Writer 

    U.S. mail carriers carry more than just the U.S. mail.
They carry something else so secret that nobody outside the
Postal Service knows about it -- except four crooks who steal
them from letter carriers on the streets of Miami. There's a
$25,000 reward for tips producing capture and conviction.

Comments?
Please direct any replies for the list to me also, as I am
still on Ray's FCPUNX, which I suppose makes this list
double-filtered for me now, if a little delayed. :-)

Typically, I now care what the mystery device is, since the
occasionally-disgruntled ones don't want me to know.
JMR

One of the "legitimate concerns of law enforcement" seems to be
that I was born innocent until proven guilty and not the other
way around. -- me
