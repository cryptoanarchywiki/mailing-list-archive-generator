Omnipoint has a full-page ad in the New York Times today
which capitalizes on Newt's lack of privacy and claims that
its spread spectrum phone would have protected him with
with encryption and digital technology superior to cellular:

   http://www.omnipoint.com

Nokia, for one, touts its use of the CAVE encryption in its
latest unit, although its not clear which version.

The CAVE algorithm and implementation is now at:

   http://www.replay.com/mirror/cave/

News may be forthcoming about CAVE -- which, to remind,
is an acronym for Caller Authentication and Voice Encryption.

It has apparently gone through several versions -- whether
getting progressively stronger or weaker is a question soon to 
be answered authentically?
