Hi!  It's useful to include a subject line in email so people
can decide whether to read it and have more context for it,
though calling yourself "fuck you" will probably deter a few people.
There are lots of anarchists on the net; you can run into some good
discussions on Usenet on several newsgroups with "anarchy" or "anarchism"
in the titles.  Rec.caves has good underground material......

As far as decryption tools goes, they're pretty closely related
to encryption algorithms.  There's been a discussion, probably on
cryptography@c2.org (subscribe via cryptography-request@c2.org)
though maybe it was on cypherpunks, about designing a screen-saver
DES-cracker.
