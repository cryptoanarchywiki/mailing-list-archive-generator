There's a low-tech solution. There's a stock GSA form for recording
a container [safe] combo. You seal it up, put it in an envelope, you
& witness sign across the flap. You store same in another container,
such as in the security office. [THAT safe combo is usually kept
in a 24-hour manned location such as the ECC or such.]

Think along those lines, perhaps.
