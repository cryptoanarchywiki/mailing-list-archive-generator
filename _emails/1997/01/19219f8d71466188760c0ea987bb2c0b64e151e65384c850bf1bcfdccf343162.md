  Of course I'm paying attention.
  That's why Sandy had to 'double-talk' to explain how his denial 
that the post was sent to the 'flames' list really meant that it
was sent to the 'spam' list, which just happens to be the 'flames'
list, except on Thursdays between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., when it is 
called the 'shit' list.
