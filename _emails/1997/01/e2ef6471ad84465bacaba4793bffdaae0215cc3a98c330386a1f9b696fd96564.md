>Yes, it's the very same Bimbo who scuttled Gary Hart's campaign, 
I think you have to give Gary all the credit for that;
the "Hey, I'm not doing anything wrong and you could follow me
around 24 hours a day and not find anything" bit convinced me that
Hart was a major flake, and doing it when the only credible
Democrat to take over after him was Walter F@#&! Mondale
was just unconscionable.  If he'd said something like "Get Off My Ass" or
"Reagan's not on his first wife, so what's your point" or
"my marriage is off limits" or whatever I'd have had some respect,
and for a Democrat he hadn't seemed to be that bad.

She's a _former_ bimbo, who has ostensibly rehabilitated herself.
Not that that puts her in a position to throw stones at other people..

Not enough room to fool around on a bass-fishing boat?
