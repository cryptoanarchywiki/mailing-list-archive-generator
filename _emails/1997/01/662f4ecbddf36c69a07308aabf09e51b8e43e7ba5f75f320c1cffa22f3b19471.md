I used Altadena as a generic example of a suburb, although Camarillo
would be even better, since it's not so cosmopolitan as most of the
'burbs right next to L.A.  Hollywood (to me) is an ideal example of
inner city, for a lot of reasons.  I love the place, dirt and all.

BTW, I was *not* referring to walking around, I was comparing driving,
mainly on the freeway.  Statistics have come out in major papers that
back my experience up 100%.  I drive from P.C.H. @ Seal Beach Blvd.
to the Ventura County beach area every weekend, and back again.  I
used to go down the 101 to the 405, then south on the 405 to Seal
Beach Blvd.  Nowadays I take the 101 all the way into town to the 5,
down the 5 to the 605, and down the 605 to 7th Street in Long Beach.

It's 3 miles further thru town, and 20 minutes slower on average,
but I get only about one psycho per 20 round trips now, as compared
to at least one per trip on the 101-405 combo when I went that way.

The difference was striking, and I can only surmise that rednecks and
their ilk are more fearful of attacking other people in the inner city
as opposed to the outlying regions.
