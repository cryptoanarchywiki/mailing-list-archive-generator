  Chapter VII: Libel
  
   Identification
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   A plaintiff must prove that the alleged defamatory publication refers
   to him or her.
   
   Relatives cannot sue on behalf of a deceased person. Governmental
   entities cannot bring libel claims, nor can members of large groups
   (usually 25 or more). However, if the statement can be interpreted as
   referring to a particular person in a group, that person can sue.
   Also, if the offending information pertains to a majority of the
   members of a small group, any member of the group has standing to sue.
   
   A corporation may bring a libel claim if the alleged defamatory
   statement raises doubts about the honesty, credit, efficiency or
   prestige of that business. However, if the statements refer only to
   corporate officers, the corporation cannot litigate on their behalf.
