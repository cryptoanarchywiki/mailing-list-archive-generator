Subject:      Members of Congress file CDA Amici Curiae Brief
To:           CYBERIA-L@LISTSERV.AOL.COM

Approximately 22 members of Congress filed an Amici Curiae brief with
the Supreme Court in Reno v. ACLY, the constitutional challenge to the
Communications Decency Act (this makes three known briefs filed so far
in support of the CDA).  The brief was filed on behalf of, among others,
Exon, Coats, Helms, Grassley, Hyde, and Goodlatte.  It was written by
Bruce Taylor and Cathleen A. Cleaver.  This brief can be accessed at
