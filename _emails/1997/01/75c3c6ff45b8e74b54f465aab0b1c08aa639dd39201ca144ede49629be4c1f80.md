My point about the antibiotics is that the male gays take a dis-
proportionate amount of them, which compounds their problems.  It
suggests to me that the immune system is already seriously debilitated
or damaged before AIDS can take hold, rather than the notion that a
healthy person can get it from the virii alone.

One could argue that in the cases where the cures (antibiotics) add to
a person's problems by further corrupting their immune system, that
they should simply change their habits.  Since I don't see that as a
reasonable possibility, the only thing left is that the public should
be made aware of *all* of the relevant facts, even those which are
heavily suppressed now for PC reasons.
