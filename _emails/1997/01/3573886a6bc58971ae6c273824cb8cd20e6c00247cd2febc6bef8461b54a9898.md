- From the Commerce Control List:

# 5D002.a: ``Software'' specially designed or modified for the
# ``development'', ``production'' or ``use'' of equipment or ``software''
# controlled by 5A002, 5B002 or 5D002.

# 5A002.a: Designed or modified to use ``cryptography'' employing digital
# techniques to ensure ``information security'';

5A002.a covers PGP, so it would seem that 5D002.a covers premail and
Private Idaho.
