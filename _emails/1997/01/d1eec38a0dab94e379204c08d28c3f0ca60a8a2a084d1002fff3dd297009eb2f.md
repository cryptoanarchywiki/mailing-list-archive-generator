   It has been suggested that disease is merely an attempt by Nature to
 'moderate' the species.
   One could make a strong case for Nature merely 'sorting' individuals
 into physical lists, one of which is her own 'flames' list. It remains
 to be seen whether Nature also plans on dropping the 'flames' list
 after her moderation experiment is over.
