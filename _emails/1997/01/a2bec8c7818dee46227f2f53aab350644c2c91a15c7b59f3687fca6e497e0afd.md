  Yes it is. The fact that they are able to tell others when and how
they will be moderated or censored makes it so.

  So what is your point?  The moderation process has little to do with
rights or ideals. Now that the WWW is making the InterNet a money-making
entity, rights and ideals will play a decreasingly important role in 
decisions regarding its use and the censorship thereof.
  Also, since John is becoming an increasingly important political
entity in the InterNet community, I am sure that it is very important
to him to be able to control the direction of his private list (and
to use the age-old political device of having a 'front man' to take
the 'heat' for his decisions).
  It is not the first time in history that fame and fortune (or even
the smell of it in the wind) has led to 'rights' and 'ideals' needing
a small bit of 'adjustment'.
