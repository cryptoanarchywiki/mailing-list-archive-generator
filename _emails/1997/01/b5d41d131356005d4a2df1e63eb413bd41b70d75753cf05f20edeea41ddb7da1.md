I could agree with "some of the points" of the Ebonics program were
it not for the fact of the hidden points.  Unbeknownst to most folks,
supporting a program on any erstwhile points will give support to the
program on *all* points.

One specific example:

When I worked for Firestone corporate from 1970 to 1981, we were
bullied into giving to the United Fund. (BTW, I learned how much
my boss was making by reading the punches on the IBM cards.) The one
bone they tossed us was we could specify which worthy causes our
personal contribution would go towards.  The trick was, if a certain
greater-than-expected number of people specified a Catholic charity,
for example, more funds would then be moved into the other charities
to balance that out.  Presumably those funds would come from those
folks who hadn't declared a designee.

In my view, once the contributors' specific designations were made,
the remaining undesignated contributions should have been split
across the designees according to the original percentages declared
in the U.F. literature.  Anything else would be a farce.
