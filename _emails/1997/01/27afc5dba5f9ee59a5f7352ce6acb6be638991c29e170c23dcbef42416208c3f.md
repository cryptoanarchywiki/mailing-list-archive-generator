I would assume the staff knew the person. But that's not the point. The
beer delivery man could hardly know what was in the kegs. The kegs might
have been switched beforehand. In the warehouse, at a previous stop, etc.
An attacker might have to replace several kegs, to make sure that at least
one altered keg makes it inside the "secure" area. This can be done quite
easily.
