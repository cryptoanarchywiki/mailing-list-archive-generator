Given his troubles with this "hay seed" scanner recording democrats, ol' Newt
may be more receptive to encryption.

Our privacy certainly is getting trashed by this presidency and I am hoping
an impeachment is coming down the line.

Since the congress is who makes the laws, maybe we all can focus some snail
mail to these guys.

Perhaps EFF could even draft some laws for our protection (what a joke - just
to keep busy body beaurocrats outta our business).

What does it matter anyhow, these guys dont read their own 300 - 5000 page
laws anyhow....

Hopeless....
