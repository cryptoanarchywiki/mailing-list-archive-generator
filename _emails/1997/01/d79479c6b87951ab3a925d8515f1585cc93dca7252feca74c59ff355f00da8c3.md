 ADSL fans may be interested to know that Ameritech has a 200 unit
ADSL trial underway in Wheaton Il as I speak. It is going very
well. The units are currently running 1.5Mbs, (T-1) but are
scheduled to go to 3Mbs later this year.

Next year rumor is 6Mbs.

In an interesting example of "Brazil Effect", ADSL may first come
to older areas, because they are all direct copper.

If I could only get ADSL cards for my DMS100.  ;)
