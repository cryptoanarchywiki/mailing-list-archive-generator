The migration to 3DES is underway, at least in the banking sector. ANSI
X.9, the group that deals with many of the protocols used in the banking
industry, has made tremendous progress. 3DES, elliptic curve, and a host of
other improvements all are out of committee and should be available as
official (for bankers :-) specs soon, if they aren't already.
