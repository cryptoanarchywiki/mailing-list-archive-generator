Will all those people who are talking about set theory and
the countability of various number systems take their discussion
to sci.math, please? 'Cuz

1) All that stuff is irrelevant to crypto, its science or politics.
..................................................


And as everyone on this list acutely knows, neither math, science, nor
politics has anything to do with crypto.   In fact, history bears out
the fact cryptologists have neither cause nor reason for what they do.
It is a useless by-product of excess mental activity for which only a
few can find application, while fewer yet have any concern for its
ramifications in a globally connected society of lightning
communication.
