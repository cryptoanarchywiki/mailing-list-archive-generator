  The CyberDweebs at plaidworks.com also seemed to take great offense
at my pointing out that what they called 'loopholes' in their system
was actually a conscious, calculated decision to leave their system
open to abuse so that every computer-illiterate Laker fan named 
Bubba could use his two-fingered typing skills to subscribe to
1,000 sports lists.

  Much of what you do goes unnoticed, due to the fact that many who 
make the same claims put you in their killfile.  It seems that they 
are only in favor of 'politically correct' technology, without any
social issues input or commentary.

  I've attended punk-rock concerts where some of the 'punks' complained
loudly and vociferously about the slam-dancers.
  "Hey, that guy 'bumped' me."
  "Somebody could get hurt."
  "Who do they think they are?"  ('Punks", perhaps?)

  Or deserve 'censorship'.
