It's a canadian cipher.  It's inventors have the initials C.A. and S.T.  pure
coincidence they say.  it's got a little write-up in Appl. Crypto 2, and I'll
post anything I can about it as soon as I get home.  I don't have my copy of
ac2 on me...  I do remember that it's patented, and you have to talk to these
folks for licences I believe.... more to come later.
