Interesting. I suspect that all of you have forgotton that in order
for there to be a revolution, there has to be something to revolt
against. It works the other way too: in order to have elitist rulers,
there have to be sheep. 

If you desire neither, then you have to renounce BOTH positions.

It's not easy, but it -always- works.
