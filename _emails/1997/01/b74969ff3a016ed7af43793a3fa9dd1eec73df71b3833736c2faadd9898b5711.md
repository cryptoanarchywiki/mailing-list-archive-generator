I do not see what was remotely "obscene" about a slip up of this 
kind, and please refrase from using the plural where it is not 
appropriate, I posted such a mistake once and immediately realised 
what I had said and retracted it.

If you had cared to comment in the rest of my posting to your reply 
you would have seen that immediately after stating this solution I 
confirmed that I do not encourage this or condone it as it is 
censorship, but that it was merely a solution, not a good one granted 
but still worthy of mentioning.

For those who (ahem) overlooked that part of my posting here it is 
again.

But of course you chose not to comment this in as it allowed you to 
credibly rant about me wanting censorship, at least argue with 
someone you have a dispute with rather than just randomly picking 
people and quoting parts of their posts out of context then flaming 
them.
