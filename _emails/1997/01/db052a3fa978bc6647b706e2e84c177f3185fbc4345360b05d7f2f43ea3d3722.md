Some weaknesses:

- It doesn't resist dictionary attacks (no salt) when the attacker can make
    one active probe (forge a fixed challenge and get the client's response).
- It doesn't stop replay attacks (replay a fixed challenge, now the same DES
    key is used, so replay DES-encrypted session data).
- DES-encryption doesn't provide message authentication against active
    attacks; use a MAC too.
- You should use independent DES keys for each direction of the connection.
- Also the DES encryption key doesn't change for each connection.  It should.
