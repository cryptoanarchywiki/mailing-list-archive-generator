Dear ecash  enthusiast,

A short note to let you know that the ecash System Integrators kit was
posted on the Internet last week.
You can find it at: www.advance.com.au/advance/ecash/sysint.htm

We are currently testing the ecash system internally here at Advance Bank.
 We hope to make the merchant software available for free download in the
next 2-3 weeks - you will then be able to start building and testing your
ecash enabled web sites.

There will also be supporting documentation, such as:
 - the ecash merchant information kit
 - how to build an ecash shop
 - ecash usage guidelines etc

Thank you again for your interest.  We'll let you know as soon as the
software is available for download.

Advance Bank
