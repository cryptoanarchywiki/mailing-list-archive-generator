I think that this is a completely fabulous idea, an commend John and
Sandy for doing this.  Let me add my own suggestion.

This will fail if flames migrate from cypherpunks-flames to cypherpunks,
I would attempt to prohibit threads that only exist in cypherpunks-flames
being continued into the moderated list.  This'll be hard to do, Sandy,
I know, but if you could think of a way to do this, I think that your
experiment is more likely to succeed.

Phrases like "As I said in the letter that only got sent to
cypherpunks-flames" should cause the whole article to be yanked,
IMHO.
