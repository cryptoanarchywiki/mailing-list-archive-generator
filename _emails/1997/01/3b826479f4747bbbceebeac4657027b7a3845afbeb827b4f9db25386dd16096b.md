  Now, the list is receiving encrypted CipherSpam.  I'm getting 
brainlock, here.
  Is this development:
  1. Good? (CypherPunks is forcing even Spammers to use crypto?)
  2. Bad? (Spammers think CypherPunks are so dumb they will 'work'
           for their spam?)
  3. Ambivalent? (It doesn't really matter, because my brain has
                  turned to spam?)
