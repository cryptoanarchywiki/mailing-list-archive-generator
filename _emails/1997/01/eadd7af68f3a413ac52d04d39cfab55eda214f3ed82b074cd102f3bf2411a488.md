Lucky,

I think that 95% figure is a bit high. I hope I did not claim it:), at
least STUMP home page gives a more conservative number of 80%. For scrm,
the number may be higher than that, but I would not guarantee 95% for
every other newsgroup or mailing list. The variable that this number
depends on is the preapproval policy.

For example, in the windows 95 newsgroup where STUMP is used, their
criteria for preapproval is very strict -- they require 5 successive
approved posts to get a poster preapproved. That will inevitably result
in more work for moderators, but heck, that's what they want.

I would normally expect this number to settle around 85-90% eventually,
but 80% is the low ballpark figure.

Attached below is STUMP's automatic periodic report about SCRM. It shows
that the rate for SCRM is about 88%.

Yes, look at Modscape at STUMP's home page (go there from 
http://www.algebra.com/~ichudov). Now it works under linux,
but can be ported to other unices (and possibly windoze also).
