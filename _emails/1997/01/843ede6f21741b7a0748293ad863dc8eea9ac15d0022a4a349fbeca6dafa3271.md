I always try to have a good time with airport security.  Last time I
flew I had a brand new stainless steel nissan thermos half full of
scotch in my backpack in addition to my laptop, a handful of dental
tools and a bunch of sticks of microcrystaline wax.

The rentacop almost shit all over himself tearing into my bag trying
to find out what the nissan was and i'm pretty sure that he did when
he saw the sticks of wax.  Course I was busy being frisked by another
guard (steel toes, steel shanks) and was really trying hard not to
laugh.

Next time I'm planning on painting some messages in lead paint and
sticking them in a folder so they can read it as it gets scanned.
Nice friendly hello <EG>
