Hi,

Does anyone know of a simple program for windows that can, like
sendmail, work as a mail agent ans send mail messages from its stdin? I
am interested in sending email messages from Windoze boxes as part of
some automated process driven by .BAT files.

i.e., what I need is a program that I could invoke like this

DOS> sendmail some@address.com
From: sender@originator.com
To: some@address.com
Subject: hello

hello




{% endraw %}
```
