You can enter a short key or import one with command [Get Key]. This is, you point
any file, and the key will become the 30000 first characters of this file.

You can get this file any where on your machine, the network, the internet, foppy,,,,,
If you add (paste or type) or delete characters at the begining of the imported key,
the reste will shift right, and this imported key become a new key.

You can't remember a key of 30000 chr (so you have to store it) but you can remenber the 
the change you made (10 to 100 or more chr) and of course, don't store it.

Thank you for your interest.
