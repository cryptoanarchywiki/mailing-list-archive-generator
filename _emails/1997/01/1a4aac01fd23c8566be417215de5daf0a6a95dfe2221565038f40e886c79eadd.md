They are 1-1 with the Reals, you can define all the operations on 
them that are defined for reals, for every representable real (like 
3.1527) there exists a DC.  You have some idea, perhaps that there 
are "real" reals, as opposed to the various constructs for defining 
them?  Perhaps you could define what a "real" real would be?
