I agree with Lucky. It may not be as easy for the great unwashed to comprehend, but 
the low-pri thread is the best way to go to maximize cpu time on the project. I too 
am running the Mersenne software on my system (and 5 others), but that project will 
go on hold once a stable version of the DES cracker is available. 

Btw: the person implementing the software may want to take a look at the software 
the GIMPS search is using. It is simple, yet effective.
