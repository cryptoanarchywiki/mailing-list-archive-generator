     I think I can speak for all of us when I say we are waiting with baited 
breath. 

     Yes, Virginia, that _is_ sarcasm.

     For $100 up front, and about $40 a month you can get a real domain name
and virtual domain that doesn't have a problem with "user overloads". If 
you are so high tech, why are you using AOL for a WEB SERVER? (this is a 
seperate issue from using it for _access_)

     With certain versions of PGP (or rather with non-us versions of certain
libraries used by PGP) you can get much larger keys than 1024. In fact with 
2.62 you can (IIRC) do 2048.

     Well, just for fun, I wrote a short C program that wrote a file of 
64,000,000 A's, and ran it thru PGP with a key size of 1024, and grabbed the
pre-ascii armor version of it. I looked thru it, and no obvious patterns 
were there.

    PGP must use a pretty good compression algorythm(sp?) since the gzip of
the A's file is only about 13 bytes longer than the gzip version. A second 
pass of gzip gives me a file of 289 bytes.

    In fact, I would doubt that any half way decent encryption program _would
show repeating worth a damn, compression should take care of most of the 
*obvious* patterns in normal text. 2 or more passes should handle anything
deliberately (or naturally) pattern heavy. 

    So no. I am not impressed. Post the code, pay OUTSIDERS to look at your
code. Get it banned by the NSA, _then_ I'll be impressed.
