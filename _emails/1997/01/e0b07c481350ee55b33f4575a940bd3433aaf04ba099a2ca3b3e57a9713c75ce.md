This whole line of reasoning is exactly what the government
is preying on -- and it's working with a lot of people. However,
it's a red herring.

By and large, the government doesn't care about file-level
encryption, the sort where the Key Escrow systems you're 
outlining would be useful. Furthermore, this kind of encryption
can be done pretty much in isolation -- it's not a communication
medium, so it's less susceptible to attacks on standardization.

What the government is mostly concerned with is encryption that's
used for communicating, where there is no similar feeling on the
part of individuals or industry that something like key escrow
is needed. It is a classic bait-and-switch maneuver.

Furthermore, if people really wanted Key Escrow, the government
wouldn't have to be putting the thumbscrews to software companies
to get them to adopt it -- the market would perform this function
quite nicely.

FWIW,
