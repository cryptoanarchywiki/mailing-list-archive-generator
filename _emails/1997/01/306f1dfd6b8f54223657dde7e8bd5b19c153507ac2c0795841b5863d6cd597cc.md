Some airlines here in the US have set up "check in" terminals
near the gate so you can check in there instead of having to
deal with human beings at the desk.  The terminal asks the
magic three questions.  No chance for seeing someone's reaction
to the questions there (unless of course there's a hidden camera 
pointed at the terminal, or some sort of biometric device attached).

One time I asked a ticket guy if he's ever had anyone say "yes" to
the magic questions, his answer was that the one time it happened 
the person turned out to be an FAA three-questions enforcement squad
conducting a check.
