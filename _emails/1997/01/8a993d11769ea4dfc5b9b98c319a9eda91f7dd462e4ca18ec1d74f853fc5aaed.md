If you missed "Meeks Unfiltered" last week, you missed how easy it was to
intercept cell phone calls, the recent decision on the Phil Karn encryption
case, and electronic freedom in Hong Kong as it is taken over by China.

Don't miss "Meeks Unfiltered" this week!

Brock N. Meeks is the publisher of the 800,000 subscriber CyberWire Dispatch
electronic news service, and he brings his crusading style into real-time
Internet video with "Meeks Unfiltered." The live uncensored hour-long
show, produced and distributed through ISP-TV, explores cyberspace and
cyberpolitics Wednesdays at 8 PM Eastern Time. 

Call-in questions will be taken during the show at (301) 847-6571.  Tell
Brock and co-host Declan McCullagh what you think!
