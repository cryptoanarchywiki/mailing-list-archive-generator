It might also be that David's year long sabatical at NSA's crypto museum 
which recently ended put him in touch with people who believe in GAK.

I found it interesting that he noted the argument that each additional
day of government access is a good thing.  This is the kind of belief
we know that NSA holds -- a.k.a. "not on my watch" -- but I haven't seen
it publicly admitted before.
