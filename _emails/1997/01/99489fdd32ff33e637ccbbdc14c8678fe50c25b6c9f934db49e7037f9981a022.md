Oh, so you're just going to fix up your program a little bit, and
immediately your private key system will turn into a public key system?
Are you sure you read A.C. and didn't just look at the pictures?

The amazing shrinking key... pretty soon we'll have 1 bit keys, and
they'll have to be registered with this company for ITAR compliance. ;)

So a cryptosystem that's been in existence for an entire eleven days (you
said it was created January 1, 1997) has had "sufficient" "analytical 
research invested"?  My, you ARE clueless.

You're right, they didn't.  It's because they published code first and
then asked for review.  They didn't try to make a profit on an operating
system-specific piece of pre-compiled code before explaining the system
and giving full details.

You mean you're changing XOR to AND?

SUB encrypt1 'Super secret encryption routine

SHARED text_to_encrypt$

text_to_encrypt$ = "[SECRET]" + text_to_encrypt$ + "[SECRET]"

END SUB

(Will you sue me for copyright infringement now?  I bet it looks identical
to your code -- and in the same language, too.)
