I think the problem is even more obvious: the "Brain Tennis" forum is a
crystallization of the worst tendency in journalism today: having two
opposing views on any issue. As on television, where two talking heads take
opposite postions, suggesting a roughly even split in popular opinion (even
if popular opinion--not to mention the underlying actual truth--is tilted
95-5).

Caveat: I've only followed a few of these "brain tennis" things, which is
what I assume Simpson is recruiting for, and I was sorely disappointed. But
not surprised.
