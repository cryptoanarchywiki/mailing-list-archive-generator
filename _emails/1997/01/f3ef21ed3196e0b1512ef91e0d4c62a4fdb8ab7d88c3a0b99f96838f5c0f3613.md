Guess what - it's still got "key escrow"!  If you've got a smartcard
that holds your key, then you've got something well-defined that can
be subpoenaed....  It's better than Yankee-style giving the government your
keys
in advance, but it's still key escrow.

On the other hand, it's voluntary, and if it interoperates with
Real PGP, then great - but will there be an expectation that you need to have
your key signed by The Post Office to use it?
