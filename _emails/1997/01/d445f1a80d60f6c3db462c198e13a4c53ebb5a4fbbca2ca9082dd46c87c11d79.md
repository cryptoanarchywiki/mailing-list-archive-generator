- From the "welcome message":

I. Administrivia (please read, boring though it may be)

The cypherpunks list is one of three lists discussing
cryptography, privacy, and social issues relating to them.  The three
lists are:

	cypherpunks		moderated to suppress spam and flames
	cypherpunks-unedited	all submissions, just as they arrived
	cypherpunks-flames	the submissions that didn't pass moderation

All of these lists are high-volume mailing lists.

This list is rapidly degenerating into something, but it's not "a playground of
illuminati and elite censors".
