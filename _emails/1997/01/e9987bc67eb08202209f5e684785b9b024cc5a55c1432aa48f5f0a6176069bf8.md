Was he wearing a ID badge with a photo?  Was he known to the security
staff?

One wonders, do they x-ray or inspect the food that goes to the 
snack bars, the liquor that goes to the bars, the merchandise that goes 
to the newsstands and gift shops?  Do they even inspect the hand baggage
of flight crews?

It isn't that airport security is lax; it's that providing security runs
at cross-purposes with providing access for the general traveling public 
and the services they expect.
