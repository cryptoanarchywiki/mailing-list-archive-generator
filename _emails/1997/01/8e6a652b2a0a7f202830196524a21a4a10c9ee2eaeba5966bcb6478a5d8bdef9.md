Not only from individual to individual.

Please consider the changes in the concepts of "sin", "freedom", "good", 
and "evil" which occur over time even within the same individual; to wit the on and off again love affair with our nation's past "enemies; individual responses to drug use especially alcohol; premarital sex (ok for me but not my daughter).

This constant flux within both society and individual makes creation and implementation of rules extremely difficult and hazardous.
