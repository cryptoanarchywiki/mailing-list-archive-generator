It's all rather academic, my dear Ian.  Just as the Atom bomb made the
United Nations mandatory, and large-scale war impossible for the U.S.,
the Internet will be the thing that facilitates ushering in one-world
government.  When Bill Gates and friends put up those 800-plus satellites
to beam the "news, entertainment, and important events" all over the world
to everyone's TV set, the circle will be complete.
