Jim, the problem here, as elsewhere in your posts, is that you 
confuse the prosaic meaning of terms with the mathematical meaning.  
"Approaching" infinity is sort of inane, mathematically speaking, but 
if it did have a meaning, it wouldn't mean "getting closer to".

Your contention is precisely what you are doing.  The term "infinity" 
means several things mathematically speaking, but the various 
meanings are precise.  Your comments demonstrate that you don't 
really know what those precise meanings are, and thus it is difficult 
for people who are used to them to communicate with you.

So perhaps you could define *exactly* what you mean by "infinity"?
