Why do I do this?

Typical Dale. A moment with Dale. Stories from the past.

However, there may be some grain of truth in this. Such socket poking might well explain Dale's (shall I say) specialness.

He went backwards quickly and has, relentlessly, never reversed direction. 

Too bad he didn't keep on doing it again and again.

Ho hum. More Dale.
