I am not enthused about the perceived need for moderation.
But neither was I enthused with the state of the list.
 
However, I will reserve judgement as to the success or failure of the experiment
for a while yet. The question for me is how much the moderation improves the S/N
ratio v.s. how much it impedes dialogue.
 
I expect Sandy to make mistakes, even by his own criterion. But anyone who will
publicly admit to shaving his eyebrows is probably not swayed by popular
opinion.
