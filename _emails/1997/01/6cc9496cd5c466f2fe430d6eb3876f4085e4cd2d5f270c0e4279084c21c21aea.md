I had to tell my sister not to use the cordless phone to use the automated
banking services that our bank has available on grounds that transfers are
also available through the same service.
Our father is a math teacher, computer hobbyists since 1979.  Both of my
parents have college educations.  My sister pegged the scales on the state
distributed proficiency tests.  Yet she knows practically nothing outside of
her field.  I will probably have to show her the values of cryptography
before she actually has any patient records to deal with, (she's a pharmacy
major.)
