I_Love_SPAM,

Do you do any type of bulk or targeted e-mail?  

Or do you want too?

I've found a spot on the net that is bulk e-mail friendly
and very inexpensive. Point your browser to:

for complete details.

P.S.  If this message reached you in error, please let me know 
and I will pass it on to where I got it and get you removed.
