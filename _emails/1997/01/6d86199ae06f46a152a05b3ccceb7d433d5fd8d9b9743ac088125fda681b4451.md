This is a perfect example of why we disagree. You feel society has the same
responsibilities as an individual, I don't.

Countries and societies are a tightly linked concept because man is a social
animal. Trying to equate this to an individual who chooses to ignore the
moral, ethical, and legal standards of their society is a non-sequiter.
