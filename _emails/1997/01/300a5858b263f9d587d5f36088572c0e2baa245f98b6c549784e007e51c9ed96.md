Actually at CERN we considered the Web to be a superset of the
Internet protocols and others such as DECNET which ran on private
networks such as our HEPNET.

Since most of those private networks are now obsolete I would consider
Web==Internet to be a reasonable equivalence. We always considered
email and news to be part of the Web (news:, mailto:). The narrow view 
that the Web was only HTTP and HTML was a piece of Andressen 
propaganda.
