This happened a year ago but I couldn't resist posting it in light of the 
current political attacks on the privacy of Swiss banks.

MANILA, Philippines (Feb 24, 1996 9:45 p.m. EST) - Former Philippine first
lady Imelda Marcos presided over a bizarre ceremony on Sunday to mark the 10th
anniversary of the People's Power revolution that forced her and her corrupt husband into ignominious exile.

Marcos -- notorious shopaholic, convicted criminal and now a legally elected
member of the Philippine Congress -- asked God to bless Corazon Aquino and
other leaders of the 1986 revolt.

But she also asked the Almighty to enlighten Swiss bankers holding some of the
estimated $5 billion the Marcoses and their cronies are accused of looting
from the national economy.

"May the Lord enlighten ... the Swiss banks -- that they might uphold justice
and preserve the integrity of their own laws and the laws of confidentiality,
trust and basic decency between the banks and their clients," she said in a
speech.

Two Swiss banks holding some $475 million linked to the Marcoses are currently
embroiled in a row over what to do with the money.

The Philippine government wants it back but a U.S. court has ordered it
distributed to victims of human rights abuses during the late Ferdinand
Marcos's 20 years in power.
