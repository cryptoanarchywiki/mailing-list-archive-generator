What a joke!  Of all the messages to whine about this guy picks the
math thread.  Somehow that wouldn't have been my first choice.

No, but it's interesting to many readers of this list and it builds
community.

our (apparently) pathetic attempts to gain understanding to be
"extremely annoying" and imply we need to be chewed out.
