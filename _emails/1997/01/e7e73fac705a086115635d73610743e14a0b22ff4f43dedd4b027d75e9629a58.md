I would like to start a thread to discuss the moderation and rejection 
policy.

My perfectly crypto-relevant article regarding possible attacks
on human relationships with the use of forged mail and anonymous
remailers, has been tossed out (sorted) into cypherpunks-flames 
mailing list.

You can receive a copy of my article by an email request.

The explanation that Sandy Sandfort gave me mentioned that he rejected
my message because it continued a thread where Sandy noticed instances
of "flaming". Note that my message was free of any flames, including
its quoted part.

Sandy also states rather plainly that crypto-relevance is not the
criterion by which he moderates this list. I question this policy.

I would like to hear your opinions as to whether such policies satisfy
the current readership.

	- Igor.
