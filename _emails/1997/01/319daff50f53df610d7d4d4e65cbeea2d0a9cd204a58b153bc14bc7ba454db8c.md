It really does rock.  I owned Eudora 3 already, but if I didn't I would
purchase it for using PGPmail alone.

Another great feature of PGPmail is that it adds PGP functionality to the
Windows Explorer.  When you right-click on a file in Windows, a PGP
submenu is added to the normal right-click menu, allowing you to encrypt,
decrypt, etc. 

This product really has the ease of use that is needed to get PGP more
into the mainstream.  Like Duncan, I found it very easy to incorporate my
existing keyrings.  I'm very impressed.

I haven't tried it with NT 4.0 yet, and don't know how well it works.  I
run the same copy of Eudora with 95 and NT, so I'm assuming it will be
fine...
