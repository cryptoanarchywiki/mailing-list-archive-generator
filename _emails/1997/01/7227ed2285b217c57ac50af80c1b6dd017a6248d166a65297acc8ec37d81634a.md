Bottom line:

You have lost some possible decryptions of the cyphertext. Every 16th 
bit is now determined therefore each 2nd byte has only 128 possible 
states. This, rather suprisingly, does not seem to affect the 
security (though I would say this is a flawed conclusion as we have a 
pile of sand problem here, how many grains make a pile, how many rngs 
can be flawed before the security is affected?) I really haven`t had 
the time to look at it properly, I will do so in the near future as 
it seems to be an interesting problem...
