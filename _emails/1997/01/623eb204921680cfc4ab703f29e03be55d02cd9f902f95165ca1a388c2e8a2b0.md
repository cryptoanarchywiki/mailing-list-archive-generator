It was not approved for the moderated list.  I sent my comments to the 
flames list where they belonged.  (It went to the unedited list too, 
but that's fair game as well.)  Sorry you didn't understand that.

So let me see if I've got this, this list should be open to all flamers 
EXCEPT me?  Curious.  At any rate, I am going to take anonymous' advice.  
I will largely refrain from addressing any of the garbage that ends up on 
the flame and spam lists.  You guys are mostly just talking to yourselves 
anyway.  

Toodles,
