Dale,
  When I read posts like this, I wonder how any rationally thinking
person can possibly believe that socio/politico concerns have no
place in the discussion of crypto.
  It is my belief that many of the more atrocious acts being performed
against the citizens by various governments are made possible by the
fact that there are so few people who recognize a 'pirate' when they
see one.
  While I appreciate that there are those who may be furthering the
cause of crypto, privacy and freedom through official channels, the
controlled media, and such, there needs to be a forum in which 
people are free to use what they consider to be the 'correct'
terminology to refer to those who have usurped democracy in order
to control the citizens for their own personal profit.
  i.e. 'Pirates'

Toto
