Believe me, at least around here it is.
I am a college student studying computer science, and 80% of the people that
I talk to on a regular basis not only know how to play around with windows,
(and Netscape), but also at least a modicum of simple fixes to simple
problems, (such as unformatting a DOS disk).  This is what I consider to be
bottom level for that 80%, however, very few of them know even as much about
cryptography as I do.  And I barely know how to use PGP.
I have had Computer Science professors express ignorance as to what PGP is,
much less all of these others that I have learned about by hanging around here.
A few people know what crypto is, but most don't.
