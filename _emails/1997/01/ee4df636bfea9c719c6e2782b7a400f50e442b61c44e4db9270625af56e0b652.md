The wealthy also use libel suits to suppress dissent.  Greg's point
that poor people aren't worth suing is only true if the motivation is
financial.  Often it is not.  Conveniently, many of those whose
silence is desired are among the petty bourgeouis and have a net worth
of roughly $50,000.  Enough to make the suit appear legitimate, but
not enough to allow the target to brush off the legal fees, if they
win the case.

Consider also the artificial distinction between private and public
figures.  It is easier for a private figure to sue for libel.  Yet,
the most influential people in the country are private figures.
Reporters must tread very carefully when covering the activities of
these people.  Thus, we hear little of them.

It would be interesting to know when libel law was first introduced to
the United States.  Does anybody know?
