I'm convinced that the message in question is a polyalphabetic 
substitution.  Among other things, did people notice quite how much known 
(or *very easily guessable*) plaintext there was in the message sample,
above and beyond the free giveaway of the first line?  Things like 
"CONFIG.SYS", "FILES=20", BUFFERS=20", and so on.  There's enough
stuff there to make serious inroads into the message without cracking
the cipher; and with their help I'm pretty sure the back of the cipher
itself can be broken.  In the half-hour I played with it I got to the
point where I could make some educated guesses about the repetition
length of the substitution, and start filling in the various alphabets.

No doubt a *real* cryptanalyst could do even better.
