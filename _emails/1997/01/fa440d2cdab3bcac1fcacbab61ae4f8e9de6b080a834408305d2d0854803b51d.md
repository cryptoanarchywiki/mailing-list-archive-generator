This is exactly how I have my twit filters set up. :)

I also have max # of messages & max # of days settings for my twit folder
so that messages that have stayed too long get automatically deleted.

I currently have 2 different folders set up 1 for twits and 1 for anonymous
posts. The twit folder is set to delete after 1 day while the anonymous posts are saved
for a week.
