About 3 years ago I went on an international flight with a large quantity
of 35mm film.  I had the film packed in my luggage inside a 50 caliber ammo
can (made out of steel).  When I glanced at the x-ray monitor as the bag
went through, I could plainly see the individual rolls of film inside the
ammo can.
