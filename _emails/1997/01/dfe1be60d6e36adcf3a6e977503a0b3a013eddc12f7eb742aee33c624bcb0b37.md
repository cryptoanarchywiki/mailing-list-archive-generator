With such witty argument, clarity of expression and well reasoned rebuttal,
you certainly have convinced *me*.

I never thought the day would come when I would actually think that, however
much I disagree with them, the pro-censorship people may have some small
arguments on their side - but that was before I saw the sort of trash you
continually spew.

If you have something to say that is of interest, maybe you may gain some
credibility. As it is, I won't be holding my breath, waiting for such a
reversal of form.

Flames welcomed, from such fools as you obviously are. While you are
attacking me, remember your form. Don't let ignorance or reality stop you.
My killfile is quite empty at the moment.

TTYL,

Marjorie
