Hey, it was J.D. Falk that started the whole thing with a loaded
defame.bot.  All I did was respond to a Freedom-Knights mailing list
article which happened to have your list in it.

As I said, J.D. Falk started the whole thing with his defamatory
prose about "Continued harassment by Grubor."  It was his fault, and
nobody's at this end.

The recognition that most every problem person is of a homosexual
nature is definitely a usenet body-politic phenomenon, which will
be documented and verified with whatever means that become necessary.

J.D. Falk Started the whole thing, and there is no way you can
get around that.  Go deal with the cypherpunks.

I have already talked to Falk's boss and Lawyer about him, and I
plan on seeing him in Court.  That shit that he publishes is not
going to last very much longer.

Over half of the problem people on usenet are Faggots, and that fact
is going to be made well known.  I want the faggot cocksucker on the
witness stand, and nothing less.

cheers,
