Regardless of which side you take on this matter, remember that the issue 
was forced by the actions of an extremely small segment of the list 
"population." 

The decision of that small segment to excercise its rights "in extreme" 
passed the tolerance thresholds of increasing numbers of list members, 
and the end result was a "restriction" adopted/elected/forced-on (colour 
it however you chose) on the entire "population."

"Rights" are derived from social responsibility; its either that, or the 
"law of the jungle."
