We've digtized the 200-page "Information Warfare-
Defense" report by the Defense Science Board.

  http://jya.com/iwd.htm  

It's quite informative about large-scale planning
for coping with the threats of information age --
encryption among many other political, economic,
technical and legal issues. There is overlap with
the NRC cryptography report on prospects for
technological fixes to security, but this report
envisions a much more comprehensive plan. 
(William Ware served on both panels; Stewart 
Baker on the IW-D.)

Comparison to threat models of the Center for Disease 
Control, FEMA and the National Drug Intelligence Center
is provocative (Appendix D).

Well worth reading for a preview of the next century's 
opportunities for wealth, power and infamy.
