It looks like Igor has made it to Sandy's list of "flamers" whose every
submission is procmailed to "cypherpunks-flames". The above quote is
crypto-relevant (as is assassination politics) and contains no flames.
it was tossed into "cypherpunks-flames" by a robot. The time stamps
clearly show that Sandy didn't even look at it.
