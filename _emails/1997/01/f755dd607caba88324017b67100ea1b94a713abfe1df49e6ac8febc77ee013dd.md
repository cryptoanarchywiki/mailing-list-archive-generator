People do do this, but if you are using RSA or other methods patented in   
the US, you might want to look at them.  Is the concept of PK   
cryptography patented?

And of course you are familiar with Bernstein v DoS...

...here Perl has the advantage of being a scripting language, and so by   
default comes as source, though if you had written the routines in a   
scripting langauge like Python, you might find it easier to convince a   
judge that it was in fact human readable...
