I agree. Security in terms of theft really doesn't concern me most of
the time. If someone steals your credit card or bank number, chances are
you'll get everything back without too much trouble (exceptional
"identity theft" cases notwithstanding). My life is structured such that
even if someone stole my car and burned down my house, I'd hardly mind.
I've got friends to stay with, I can bike to work, and I've got enough
insurance. Money is just money; I've got an average amount, which is
more than I need.

What does concern me is personal privacy. I don't want people tracking
my movements or purchasing patterns, so I prefer to use cash or
pseudonymous debit cards.
