Ian Goldberg, Eric Brewer, and I wrote a paper giving a high-level
introduction to privacy-enhancing technologies for the Internet.
Nothing terribly new, but it's about time this stuff made it past
oral history and into the literature.  To be presented at IEEE
COMPCON '97 in February.

The paper is available on the web.  A html version is at
        http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/privacy-compcon97-www/privacy-html.html
and there's a postscript version at
        http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/privacy-compcon97.ps

Comments, critiques, and discussions are welcome.
