I disagree. Where does this money "escape" to? Do you spend it on rent,
pizza, a new stereo? Hmm... These are all meatspace transactions and can
be taxed.

I met last week with a senior Clinton administration official for an
article I'm working on and posed this question to him, asking how we can
tax anonymous online transactions. He replied: "Well, we have this
corporate income tax..."
