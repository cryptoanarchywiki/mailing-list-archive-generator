This reminds me, I got a sprint 5 minute sample calling card when I got my
college texts.  I suspect that other people on this list got one as well.
Mine is completely unused and although transferring the actual cards would
cost, (the stamp and envelope), would anyone be interested in trading the
numbers?  This one is registered as being handed out in Weatherford Okla.
Five minutes of long distance is trivial, so I would be willing to trade in
regular e-mail, as opposed to through a middleman.
