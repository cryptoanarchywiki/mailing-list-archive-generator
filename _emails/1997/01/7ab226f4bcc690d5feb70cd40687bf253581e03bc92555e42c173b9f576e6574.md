While free speech is an undeniably important topic, It is just
one of many that could be discussed on this list.  A concern for
protecting privacy was the raison d'etre for the creation of the 
Cypherpunks list.  And technological self-help was always the 
modus operandi of choice.  Obviously, speech and privacy issues
are related, but they are not synonymous.  Again, I am not saying
Cypherpunks do not care about free speech issues.  There focus,
though, is on achieving privacy through technological means.
Works for me.
