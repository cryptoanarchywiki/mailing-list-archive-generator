Well considering that we are approaching the 21st Century I think it is a
little silly that one should have to worry about the line length in an
e-mail message. Even the dos based programs from the 80's could handle
wordwraping of displayed text.

<sigh> for the benifit of those misfortunate enough to be still working on
dumb terminals I have disabled my PGP script until I have time to add a
word wrap routine to it.
