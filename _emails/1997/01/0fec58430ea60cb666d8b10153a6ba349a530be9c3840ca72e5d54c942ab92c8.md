On prohibitions against surveillance countermeasures:

Here's a provocative distinction in "compromising 
emanations" (TEMPEST) from the Commerce Control 
List of the EAR:

"List of Items Controlled

   5A002.d Equipment designed or modified to suppress 
   the compromising emanations of information-bearing 
   signals;

   Note: 5A002.d does not control equipment specially 
   designed to suppress emanations for reasons of health 
   and safety."

Wonder how much dangerous EMR the regs allow to keep 
the snoops happy. Reminds me of the brain-cancer-crypto 
NSA imposed on cellular phone intentional radiators.
