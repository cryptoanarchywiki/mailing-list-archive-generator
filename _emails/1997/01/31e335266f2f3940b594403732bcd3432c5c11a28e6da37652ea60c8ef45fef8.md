Dear Dimple,

It sounds like the ASALA terrorist Ray Arachelian <ray@earthweb.com> has
forged a subscription request in your name to the "cypher punks" mailing
list!  You can complain about his forgeries and net-abuse to his bosses:
             Jack D. Hidary <jack@earthweb.com>
             Murray Hidary <murray@earthweb.com>
             Nova Spivack <nova@earthweb.com>
With luck, you'll have this dandruff-covered Armenian vandal extradicted
to Singapore, where he'll be beaten with a rattan cane for his misdeeds.
