| To CommerceNet Members Who Are Small Employers:
| 
| CommerceNet member companies who are small employers (approximately 30
| employees) are invited to participate this month with the Social Security
| Administration and PitneyBowes, Inc. in an important proof-of-concept
| project in
| which the Social Security Administration will accept digitally-signed W-2 and
| W-3 data via the Internet, with PitneyBowes issuing test software and
| public key
| certificates to participating employers. (I mentioned this test at the
| December
| CommerceNet Members' meeting.)
| 
| Participation will require completion of a field test agreement with SSA,
| submission of a request for certification by PitneyBowes, and installation of
| software on a Windows PC which will enable the generation of a signature key
| pair as well as software which will generate, sign and transmit the wage
| data to
| Social Security.  The software also produces W-2 paper forms for
| distribution to
| employees.  If a company already uses a software product to create W-2's, the
| output file can be used for this test.  (Please note that the test is not
| designed to evaluate all aspects of public key cryptography - for example, no
| certification practice statement has been developed.)
| 
| If you are interested in participating in this important public/private sector
| test of digital signature wage reporting, please contact me as soon as
| possible
| and I'll arrange for Mr. Chuck Liptz, SSA's Project Manager, to contact you
| immediately to provide additional details.  (Chuck can also be reached
| directly
| at (410) 965-7057 or <chuck.liptz@ssa.gov>.
