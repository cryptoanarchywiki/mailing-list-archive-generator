Homosexual activists have accused many prominent people, like Hoover
and da Vinci, of sharing their sexual perversions.  I have seen no
evidence that Hoover was a pervert other than a claim by one woman,
a proven liar, that she was present at an orgy where Hoover wore a
woman's dress and engaged in sex with men. Several other people who
she claimed were present at the orgy called her a liar. She's dead,
or she would have probably been supporting Geekmore and EFF today.

You may recall that the moderator cocksucker Sandfart invited me to
a "cypher punks" meating in San Francisco, and if I had accepted, would
have told many lies about my participation in their homosexual orgies.
