My wild guess is, you wanted to say that I am stupid. You think that my
stupidity implies that people are stupid. OK.

AIDAS will disappear next day, but Sandy will not. 

I would love to hear Sandy's statement as to whether AIDAS is Sandy 
Sandfort or not. If Sandy says no, I will believe him, because his
reputation has a longer time span than AIDAS's. 

In case Sandy says that AIDAS is not him, I will publicly retract my
statement, which by the way I made to AIDAS privately (I have no idea
why he posted it to the mailing list, although I do not really mind).

If Sandy chooses not to comment, I will understand.

	- Igor.
