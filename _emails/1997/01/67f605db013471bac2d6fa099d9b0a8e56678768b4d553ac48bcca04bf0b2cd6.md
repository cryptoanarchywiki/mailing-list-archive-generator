Anonymous users willing to PGP sign their posts could just use a
service like nym.alias.net (mailto:help@nym.alias.net), which even
allows pseudonyms to advertise their PGP keys via finger (slightly
better than the PGP key servers).

When people post anonymously rather than pseudonymously, it is
generally because they don't want a blatant link between all of their
posts (though obviously analysis of writing style is still possible).
