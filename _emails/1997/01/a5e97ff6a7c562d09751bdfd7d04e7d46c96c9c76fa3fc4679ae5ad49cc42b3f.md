irrational means 'not expressible as the ratio of two integers', this does
not imply uncountable.

Whether 0.12345678910111213... is irrational or not depends on how we choose
to define a rational number where the denominator and numerator are both
approaching infinity and how quickly those approaches occur.

[ What is your definition of infinity/infinity ?]

As alluded to before,

  0.12345678910111213    =    12345678910111213.... / n 

  (where n = infinity)
 
0.123456789101112... is certainly countable because by the definition of
countable it must be 1-to-1 with the counting numbers (ie non-negative
integers), which this one clearly is since it contains each positive
non-zero integer (ie the set of numbers required to produce the number are
clearly less, 1 less to be exact, than the counting numbers).

c=2pi*r

so,

pi = c/2r

You have a algorithm (ie recipe) for determining pi to whatever degree of
precision you are willing to go to. If you insist on using a digital
computer (whose domain of operation is limited to rationals by defintion)
then you are doomed to fail. However, move to analog computers (eg a
compass) and it can be quite easy to calculate, though not easy to plug into
an equation.

Complex numbers are not a member of the Reals, rather the Reals are a
sub-set of the Complex.

"If every segment is to have a numerical measure as its length, then a new
domain of numbers is needed, an extension to the domain of rational numbers.
This new domain can no longer be constructed, as in the previous case, by
number pairs. But hints for its construction are provided by a theoretical
analysis of the measuring process for segments."

A mathematicaly rigorous defintion of the class of numbers called 'Real'
is that which equates the members of that set to the possible lengths of an
arbitrary line segment.
