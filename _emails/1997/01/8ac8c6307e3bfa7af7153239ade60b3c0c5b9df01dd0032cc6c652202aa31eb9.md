Jonathan Littman's book on Kevin Poulsen, "The Watchman : The Twisted
Life and Crimes of Serial Hacker Kevin Poulsen" is coming out this month, 
so I checked into Amazon (http://www.amazon.com) to see if it had been 
released yet.  It has an interesting blurb for the book:

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Synopsis:
Drawing on exclusive interviews with serial killer Kevin Poulsen, who's
                                            ^^^^^^
currently serving time in federal prison, journalist Jonathan Littman
takes readers along on the wildest, most colorful crime spree in the
annals of cyberspace...
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Yikes!  Seems this book will have more revelations than I had previously 
thought.  Maybe CoS will take down that page with all the bad stuff they
say about him (http://www.theta.com/goodman/crime.htm) now that he's out.
