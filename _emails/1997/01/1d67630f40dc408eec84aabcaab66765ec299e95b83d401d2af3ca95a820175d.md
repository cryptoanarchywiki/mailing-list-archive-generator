I have not seen the production box, I am going from my memory of Eric's
preproduction description at a meeting last spring.  I hope someone who
knows what they are talking about will butt in here if I am wrong.

The box has a 3 or 4 digit display which displays "something" about the
3DES key, where "something" is some of the bits, or a hash, or ...  With 3
decimal digits, a MIM attacker has a 999 out of 1000 chance of getting
caught.
