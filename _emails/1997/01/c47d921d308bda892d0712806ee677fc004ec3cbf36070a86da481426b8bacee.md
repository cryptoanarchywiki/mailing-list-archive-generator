Nonsense - the net doesn't "belong" to "Singapore or China" -
it's made up of the activies and property of many different people.
If some of those people don't like what other people are saying,
or reading, they've got no right to limit it, just because they've
got enough guns to call themselves "the government".
If they don't like something, they don't have to read it,
or they can send out their own counter-propaganda.
