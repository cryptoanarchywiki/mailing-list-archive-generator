Most of the erstwhile elite types do the ordinary things in a quite
ordinary way.  Get dressed, eat, collect and send e-mail, and so on.

The un-ordinary things (for example) are the thought processes which
take place while typing out a post.  Those thought processes don't
generally intersect directly with the mundane things such as operating
the computer, unless the operations themselves are unusual and demand
the full attention of the person involved.
