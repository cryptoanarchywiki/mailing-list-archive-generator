When I recall my growing up years and the political/social arguments
I participated in, I can hardly believe the things I've learned since,
esp. things like government agencies sharing asset forfeitures as a
means of funding further seizures (kind of snowballs, if you know
what I mean).  Check out H.R. 3355 of late 1993, which authorizes
Janet Reno to personally treaty up with the local cops in every U.S.
city of 100,000 pop. or more, i.e., most of the U.S. population,
and virtually all of the "crime".

There was a previous post today, perhaps yours, which made the point
that while erstwhile freedom fighters are trying to put out one fire
or another, the govt. boys are lighting dozens more.  I guess that
means we'll have to pony up a lot more tax money to pay those guys.
Whoops!  I forgot - they can self-fund now with the asset seizures.
