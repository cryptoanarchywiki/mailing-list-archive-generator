   it is easy undex unix, what you have to do is store arriving article
   in separate directories by message ID and run diff (with certain
   corrections) on these two directories.

   diff will print you the files that are in one dir and not in another.

   take an extraction, and delete too new articles (so that propagation
   does not screw you up).

   thats it

If you just want the differences and aren't too concerned with
timeliness, I'm planning on running a cypherpunks-rejects list containing all
the messages that went out the unedited list but didn't show up on the
moderated one within x hours (not sure what x should be yet).
