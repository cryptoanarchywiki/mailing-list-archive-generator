I somehow doubt that Douglas has sufficient Vaseline to fulfill his
erotic fantasies!  (Or his "god" is rather small...)

How many clueless spammers need to get stung by indiscriminately
posting to spam-bait addresses planted in Usenet until they figure
out that it's a Really Bad Idea[tm]?

I've heard rumors that at least one idjit spammer lost his account
for spamming a religious mailing list with something like that!  Can
you say "oops"?
