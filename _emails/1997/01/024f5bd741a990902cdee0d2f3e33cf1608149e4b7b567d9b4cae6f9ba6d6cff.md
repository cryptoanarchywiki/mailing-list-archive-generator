In today's (22 Jan 97) Long Island, NY Newsday Viewpoints, p. A31:

"Let Feds Overheard Cellular-Phone Talk"
by David Kahn (an editor at Newsday and author of "The Codebreakers")

He intones the usual horseman: "...such criminals as terrorists, drug-
runners, kidnappers and child-pornographers are increasingly using 
encryption to conceal their plans and activities, the FBI says."

He also mis-states opponenents of GAK positions, claimingthe 
criticism is that "key escrow [at least he doesn't call it key 
recovery] won't work all the time", ignoring anti-GAK mentions of 
COINTELPRO, J.Edgar Stalin^H^H^H^H^H^HHoover, etc. etc.
And the usual nonsense about "every day that criminal messages can be 
heard is a gain" w/out noting that anyone smart enough to use crypto 
now will not use it if GAK is fully implemented.

Newsday is part of the LA Times Syndicate, so member papers may also 
have the same viewpoint appearing in their pages within the next 
couple of days.

Their website is http://www.newsday.com ... I don't know if the 
viewpoint is on-line there.
