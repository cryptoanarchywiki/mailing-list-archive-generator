You might start with the Mail Filtering FAQ:

http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/faq.html

It's pretty Unix-specific, covering procmail, Elm filter, and mailagent.
For PC-based mailers, you're probably better off checking the documentation
and/or the web page for the one you're using.  Finally, take a look at the
comp.mail.* newsgroups.

Or just use the search engines, throwing in combinations of the above terms...
