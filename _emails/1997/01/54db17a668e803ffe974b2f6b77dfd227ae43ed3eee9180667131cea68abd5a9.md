Yes. Igor's STUMP software seems like the way to go. The vast majority of
posters to this list are not a problem. Discussions amongst them may get
heated, but they have basic human decency and never even come close to the
level of abuse and bigotry we have seen from Vulis, aga, et al. 

Igor claims that on lists moderated by STUMP, 95% of the people are
pre-approved. I believe it. Because 95% of the posters are not a problem.
It is a small part of the other 5% that fuck things up. I second Sandy and
John's proposal to moderate Cypherpunks. I propose we use Igor's STUMP
software for this purpose, iff it performs as claimed.

[Does STUMP have a web interface?]

Thanks,
