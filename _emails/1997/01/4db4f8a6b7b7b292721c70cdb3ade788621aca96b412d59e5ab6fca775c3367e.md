Could someone please forward me the URL of the FAGGOT (are the caps
manditory?) detecting software for mailing lists. I feel pretty left out
as almost everyone else know who the FAGGOTS are. Is this the same
software that detects Cocksuckers or does Dr Dimitri have something of
his own. Maybe we could all band together and come up with something
that detects Nazi moderators as well.
