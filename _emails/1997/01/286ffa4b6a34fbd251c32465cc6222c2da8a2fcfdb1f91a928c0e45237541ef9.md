They don't have to.  They will almost certainly approve almost any
non-crypto data security product for export (well, unless they want to
punish a company for domestic crypto products :-(, but I think the
commerce department can deny actually deny all a comany's exports even
without EAR).

What's really going on here is that the NSA wants to know exactly
what's out there in terms of virus protection and security software,
so that if they need to release a virus or something they know exactly
how to work around the defenses people are using.  You're not going to
too many export applications denied for this kind of stuff.  It's more
just a way for them to know exactly what's going on in that realm.
