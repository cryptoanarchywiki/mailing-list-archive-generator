So you have read applied cryptography and decided that qualifies you 
as a cryptographer?

No new company should be dabbling with new algorithms, an assurance 
of a high probability of security comes with years of attempted 
cryptanalysis.

This is irrelevant rubbish, if there is a cryptanalytic attack on 
your algorithm a brute force attack becomes unecessary and key size is 
not of consequence.
