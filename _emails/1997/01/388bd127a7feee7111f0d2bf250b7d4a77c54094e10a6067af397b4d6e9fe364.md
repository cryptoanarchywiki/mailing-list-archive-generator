I'm playing with SecureDrive; the problem is not with using it
with a Zip disk so much as it is trying to get it to play nice
with Windows 95.

ObCrypto: Check this out (from the readme.txt that comes on
every Zip disk before you delete it)

7.  Secure sensitive files.
     To keep sensitive or confidential information safe, store it
     on a Zip disk and use your Zip Tools software to assign a
     password that must be used in order to read from or write to
     the disk.  At work, you can protect sensitive information
     such as personnel files, company directories, and product
     plans and designs.  At home, you can secure personal
     information such as tax records, budgets, and computerized
     checkbooks.

Iomega hasn't been willing to tell me how the password is stored,
so this looks like a big boiling pot of snake oil.  Anyone out
there played with Zip drive/disk internals and know how it works?
