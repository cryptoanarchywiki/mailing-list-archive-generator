What a joke!  Of all the messages to whine about this guy picks the
math thread.  Somehow that wouldn't have been my first choice.

No, but it's interesting to many readers of this list and it builds
community.

I don't get this at all.  You have particular knowledge in the field,

"extremely annoying" and imply we need to be chewed out.
