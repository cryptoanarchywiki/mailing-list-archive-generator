	So, we had a spike of spam attack around Christmas,
primarily using the mechanism of subscribing the cypherpunks
list to other mailing lists. Now, everybody is off designing
methods to limit postings to the list.

	You know what this reminds me of? The enthusiasm displayed
by the the current US government administration to get bills passed
that would curtail even more rights of its citizens in the wake of
the TWA flight 800 crash.

	Cypherpunks, you have met the enemy and it is you.
