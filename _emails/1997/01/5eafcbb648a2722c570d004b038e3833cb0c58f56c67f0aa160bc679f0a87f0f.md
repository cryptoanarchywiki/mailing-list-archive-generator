It is my understanding that an ordinary banking consumer that
uses "pay bills by phone" service cannot transfer $$ to any arbitrary
account. There is a limited list of permitted accounts, such as utility 
companies. Therefore, the risk of unauthorized transfer is very
limited.

I would not be worried about this issue at all. The world at large is
insecure in very many respects: it is easy to find out credit card
numbers, overhear conversations, install hidden microphones, hack
into computers, etc etc. It does not mean that we should stop all 
activity simply because there is "some" risk of losses.
