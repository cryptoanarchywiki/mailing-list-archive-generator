This ratio has one of 3 outcomes in my system depending on the rate of
approach to infinity of the defining functions,

oo/oo = 0  if the denominator grows faster than the numerator

oo/oo = oo if the numerator grows faster than the denominator

oo/oo = 1  if the two functions grow at equal rates
