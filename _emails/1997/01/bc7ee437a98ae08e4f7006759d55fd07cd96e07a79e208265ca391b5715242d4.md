This is incorrect.  The argument outlined applied to real numbers
only.  If you wish to refute the argument please do so.  You might
find it helpful to review the reference in Smullyan's book.

The subtlety of the idea lies in the fact that you can't make a
statement like "$foo is not describable" where $foo means anything.
Any number for which you can say, "I can draw a line which is $bar
units long" is describable.
