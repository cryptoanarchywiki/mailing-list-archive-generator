The arguments about imaginary quotes and libel are harder to untangle
because the moderation process seems to consume the mail headers showing
the messages' travels before reaching toad.com.  I suggest that these
headers are signal not noise, and should be propagated if at all possible.
We have had problems in the past with forgeries, and should retain this
basic tool for evaluating a message's source.

<preemptive remarks>
I know I could get these from the unmoderated list -- but I prefer the
moderated version so far, and think they should be here also.
I know PGP signatures are a better way of authenticating a message.
</preemptive remarks>
