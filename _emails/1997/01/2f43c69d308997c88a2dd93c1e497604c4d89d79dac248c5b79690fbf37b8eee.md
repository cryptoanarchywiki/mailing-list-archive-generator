well....I guess you didn't want a reply to your real email address,
considering you'd be flamed like a 'mother$##@*(%'.  anyways....Just so
YOU know I figured out the infamous Rubik's cube when I was 9 years
old...no solution book, nothing, and beat the world record(ooooo what an
accomplishment).  I just figured it out...so if I was 9.........geee 
what do you think?  I could sit down and give you the mathmatical<sp>
computations...but I have better things to do.  I hope your just trying
to have a better understanding of cryptography standards, and future
methods.  Maybe reading some information on algorithms....that might
help....maybe calc 101  or ignorant 111..or jeez...do you even know
binary?
