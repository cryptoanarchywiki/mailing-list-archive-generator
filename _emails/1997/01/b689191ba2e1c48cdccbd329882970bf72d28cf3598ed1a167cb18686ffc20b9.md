The Uniform Trade Secrets Act (which has been adopted by a
majority of jurisdiction) provides for liability of a third party who
knows or has reason to know that information he recieves or discloses
was acquired by improper means or under circumstances giving rise to
a fiduciary duty OR that he knows to be proprietary but which he
recieved by accident or mistake.  Depending on the facts, the
language could encompass a moderator who knew about or turned a blind
eye to distribution of trade secrets on his list.
