Is it really true that my response was tossed out as flames?

It was crypto-relevant.

BTW, this is a more than perfect illustration why rejections
based on "shitstrings" are completely inappropriate for moderating.

I have nothing again "grey lists", when moderators are alerted when a
message containing certain suspicious word arrives (the way it's done in 
STUMP), but am opposed to autorejections (unless mods are mailbombed).
