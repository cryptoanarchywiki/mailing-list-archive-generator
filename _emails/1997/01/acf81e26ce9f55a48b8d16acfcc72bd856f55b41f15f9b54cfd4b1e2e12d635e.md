It is clear from reading this that all equal employment
laws should be eliminated.

Yes, and this points out how homosexuals and females (who are usually
always also homosexual) are the WORST thing that any viable
Corporation can ask for.  An ALL male heterosexual entity is the ONLY
way to survive the business world today.  A woman's place is in the
home, and a faggots place is NEVER to be superior to any heterosexual
person.
