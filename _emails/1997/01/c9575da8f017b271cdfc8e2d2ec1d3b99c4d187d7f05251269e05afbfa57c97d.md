What exactly is the status of RSA's DES contest?  I understand that at
least two of the smaller contests have already been cracked, but I
haven't seen much beyond theoretical discussion on the list on the
topic of the DES contest.

What work has been started on this contest?  I am aware of Peter
Trei's excellent deskr software for win32, but at the moment it chokes
on RSA's real contest data as distributed.  Has anybody yet worked on
porting a version to x86 Linux, with nice, fast, inline assembly?

How about a keyrange-server?  This contest is so huge that any procedural
innovations will probably be much more helpful than getting an early
start.  Has anybody started work on this yet, or is everyone else
waiting for someone else to do it?
