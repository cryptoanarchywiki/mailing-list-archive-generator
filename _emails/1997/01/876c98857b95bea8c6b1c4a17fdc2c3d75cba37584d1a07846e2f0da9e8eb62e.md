Your thinking is incorrect.

If you have a credit card, call up customer service, and ask if you
can do a check by phone. There are a dozen services that do it. A
verbal agreement is all that's necessary. I'm not even sure the calls
are recorded; I recall no telltale beeps, which are required in 
California and other states. Western Union may do such transfers for
a fee.

I quite agree. Sad, but true.

I don't have a banking background, but I've done exactly the above as a 
standard-issue idiot consumer. All they need is your account number, a 
unique check number, and the central bank routing information. And your 
SSN, which your credit card company has already (how convenient). Oh, 
and I'm sure they need a hell of a lot of liability insurance.
