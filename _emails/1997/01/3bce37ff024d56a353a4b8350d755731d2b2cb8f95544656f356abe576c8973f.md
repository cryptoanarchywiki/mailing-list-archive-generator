Perhaps the axioms in set theory that tells us that the integers
have an uncountable number of subsets is, in point of fact, false.
Perhaps only those subsets of the integers that can be described
by an algorithm exist (actually, contrary to what the usual axioms of
set theory assert).

We know that the set of axioms which tell us that there are unaccountably
many reals can be satisfied by a countable model!
(Downward Louwenheim Skolem Tarski theorem.)

I know that Standard mathematical axioms yields lots of interesting
results, but when it talks of the infinite and we are dealing
with a practical subject like cryptography or even physics it
should not be taken too seriously. (With respect to uncountable sets.)
