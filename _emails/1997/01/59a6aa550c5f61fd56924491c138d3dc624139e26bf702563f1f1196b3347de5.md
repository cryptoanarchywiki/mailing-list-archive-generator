The circuit-switched voice signal is digital also, and the voice
packet payload is transferred byte for byte into the circuit switched
link right?  So to insert IDEA encryption inside the A5 layer, you'd
need to packetize the IDEA ciphertext so that it conforms to the voice
packet spec (to fool the unwrapping the GSM station performs into
thinking the packets are voice packets).  Is that possible?  Is the
packet switched protocol non-error corrected?  (ie Is packet dropping
expected?)  If so you need to use an IDEA mode which does not rely on
previous packets.

If the above is infeasible.  Probably this is a more practical
approach anyway, as the data port has been already engineered to solve
some of problems that would be encountered, and you would be
duplicating effort.
