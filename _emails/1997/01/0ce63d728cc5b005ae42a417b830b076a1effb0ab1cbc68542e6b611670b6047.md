BONN, GERMANY, 1997 JAN 6 (NB) -- By Sylvia Dennis. The German  
government passed a major round of legislation in the runup to 
Christmas that aims at regulating the Internet and protecting user 
privacy. 

	No surprise there....

{}
The law also prohibits the use of "cookies," software applets that
trace a user's path across the Internet and recording the data they
view.

	This is, to me!
