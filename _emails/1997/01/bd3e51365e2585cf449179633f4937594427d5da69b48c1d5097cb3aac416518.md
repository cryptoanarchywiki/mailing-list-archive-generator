Here's a perfect example of two concepts, the first very thoughtful
(however flawed), and the second not very thoughtful at all.

"Innocent until proven guilty" is good for individuals, but it is mis-
construed for organizations.  Sure, officials who do public service,
and moderators/censors who have to make judgements need to be protected
from penalties for common everyday mistakes. But "innocent until proven
guilty" is being misapplied here, to suggest advance trust for entities
that haven't earned any trust.  You might fool some people, but you
aren't fooling me.
