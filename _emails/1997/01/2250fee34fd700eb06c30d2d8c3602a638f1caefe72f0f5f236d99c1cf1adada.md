Yes, they should. Nevertheless, if they fall into the hands of (a)
government, I'd consider them compromised and would see to revoking
them quickly.

That's the whole point, because you can't do it yourself anymore
(got arrested).
Besides, what I tried to do is find a way WITHOUT relying upon only
one other person. The only one person, who should be able to revoke
your keys by himself is you.
If you can't do it yourself due to circumstances, then there can be
other people doing it for you, but it shouldn't be only one
person, but several. Only that way, nobody alone can revoke your
keys "by accident". :)

Sounds like an idea, although it might come along with a lot of
inconveniences, technically. (I am going on vacation to Hawaii and
forgot to disable the automated dead-man switch and I come back 3
weeks later to find all my keys revoked, for example) :)
