Hi,


These messages have been sent about fingerd.
My preference for fiddling with remote fingers is to
leave fingerd as supplied by the vendor (run by "nobody") and
replace the finger program itself.  It can be made to recognise
when it is being run by "nobody" and behave differently
from when run by another user.

Source at the end of this file.  (Bashed out fairly quickly
starting from a utmp-eraser I made for a luser who wouldn't
tolerate wall messages from shutdown.)

I have (among other things) an extension to TCP-wrappers
(a new hosts_access.c file), and a prog to find disk space wasted by duplicated files.  
(mail me with Subject: "send goodies" for these.)
