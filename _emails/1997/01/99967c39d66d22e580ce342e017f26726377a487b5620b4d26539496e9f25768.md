Ok, just something that would be a nasty little virii in its own way...
If there was a virii produced that copied down a persons keystrokes every
time, and then when they logged onto the InterNet aka aachieved a PPP/Slip
connection, it automatically sent (without there knowing) a copy of all
the keystorkes they have made so far, and then deletes them from an
encrypted file, or from within a file it has been adding them too
*shrug*...
.. aka Automatically sends it to say an anonymous email account or some
such.

Ok *shrug*  jsut an idea...  later.....
