    the bottom line is simple:  either

    1.  swamp the techno-ignorant fools with hollow traffic

    2.  wait and hope the courts have the balls to enforce the
        first and fourth amendments.

    civil disobedience, despite the Feds learning from the Chicago 7
    trial that selective individual prosecution is more effective to
    strike terror in the hearts and souls of the 'deviants', needs to
    be organized at _all_ colleges and law firms, who unfortunately
    are at least as techno-illiterate as the members of Congress.

    Will Rogers summed it up: "circus? you want to go to the circus?  
    Why? Congress is in session."

    however, living in the Intermountain Empire, I vote to secede from
    the totalitarian fools that claim they are governing a republic
    with our consent; or, in the immortal words of Thomas Jefferson
    
      "God forbid we should ever be twenty years without a rebellion."
