   Criminal Intellegence Eases Policeman's Lot
   
   Reuters
   16-SEP-97
   
   
   CAMBRIDGE, England, Sept 16 (Reuter) - Privately held Harlequin Group
   Ltd said it introduced a software product which harnesses artificial
   intelligence to speed up criminal investigations.
   
   The product, Harlequin Intelligence, displays criminal investigation
   data in graphical form. Artificial intelligence is used to break down
   witness statements into their component form and instantly links
   evidence to existing databases.
   
   The graphic displays allow a quick snapshot of the progress of an
   investigation.
   
   In a statement released at the Cambridge International Symposium on
   Economic Crime, Harlequin said the system discovers links or
   identifies associations that may not be immediately apparent to an
   investigator or analyst.
   
   ``Harlequin Intelligence is designed for use by major law enforcement
   and investigation agencies to combat many different types of crime
   including homicide, fraud and drug related offences. It is also
   designed for use in commercial business information environments where
   these powerful technologies can be equally applied to corporate
   business concerns,'' the Cambridge based company said in a statement.
   
   A spokesman declined to reveal the cost of the system or the company's
   sales targets but said the system had already been sold to the Los
   Angeles Police Department, a force in Florida, the U.S. Federal Bureau
   of Investigation, and four police forces in Britain.
