Does the bill retain the 5 years first offense, 10 years second offense
provisions for using crypto in the comission of a crime?

Let's see: Lucky sells five copies of PGP. That's 5+(5+4*10)=50 years in
prison. Or is it (5*5)+(5+4*10)=70 years? Doesn't make much of a difference
at my age, I suppose.
