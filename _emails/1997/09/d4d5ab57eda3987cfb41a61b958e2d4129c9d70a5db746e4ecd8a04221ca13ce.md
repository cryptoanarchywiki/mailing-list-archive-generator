Actually, one of the UC Berkeley professors actually *got* a patent on key
escrow methods.  Micali, as I recall.

As for the "expedited patents" bullshit, that's an abuse of the patent
process, to support certain political goals by expediting certain
applications and (obviously, given ontological realities) delaying others.

As for terrorism, the United States is basically the major
terrorism-supporting state in the world.
