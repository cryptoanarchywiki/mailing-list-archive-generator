Last night's votes on SAFE in the Commerce committee are in place at
http://www.crypto.com/member/

Simply select the member of Congress you're curious about, either by zip code
or by state, and you can see how they voted in the three Commerce votes
last night.  Then, you can call and yell or send kudos.

If you're a part of the Adopt Your Legislator program, you'll be receiving
a custom-tailored alert soon with all this information.
