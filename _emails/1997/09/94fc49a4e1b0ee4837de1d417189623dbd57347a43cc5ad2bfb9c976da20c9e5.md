Your last sentence means that they can read crypted text.  They even 
hinted at it recently.  But then, why the proposed law?

Do they indulge in statistical efficiency or do they want 99.9999+% 
efficiency at their "filtering"?  I'd say if they "filter" only, say, 
90% of all communications and an Oklahoma City plan passes by in the 
10% remaining, it won't be good enough for them.  So, why the law if 
they already can decrypt?  Can you reasonnably expect the vilains 
to use the most easy-to-crack and/or GAKed schemes?

If you were in their shoes, what would you say to the public?  Ever 
heard about the game called Poker?  Did Santa told you they would 
never lie to you?

In the last few weeks, I've been thinking about the utility and 
security risk of using PGP if it can be cracked easily.

And then, I realized that my reaction was probably just what they 
expected: FUD to have people limit by themselves their use of strong 
crypto.  Coupled with the cops saying that "of course, we can decode 
them, but just a tad too slow to protect your childs...", I now 
believe they just can't crack it.

And with it, comes their crackdown on crypto users, their e-$ and 
their crypted love letters.
