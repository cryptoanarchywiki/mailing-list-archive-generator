I ran across this short summary of various national emergency orders. A
useful reminder that the government views us as cogs in the machine, to be
used as necessary. And that private property may be seized at will. 

So much for the actual Constitution. (Declan cited a poll showing
ignorance of the Constitution. I would have flunked, too. E.g., "What do
you call the first 10 amendments to the Constitution?" My answer: "You
call them "null and void."")

Search engines will turn up the full versions of each of these orders.
Some are part of the Continuing Economic Emergency (tm), either the one
declared in 1971 by Nixon, or the one declared by Johnson or Kennedy or
Eisenhower. Or perhaps the one declared by Roosevelt (when banks were
shut, when gold was declared contraband, and so on). Or maybe the one
declared 135 years ago by Lincoln. Or maybe the emergency declared during
the Whiskey Rebellion. And so it goes.
