It's amazing that Freeh would admit that shooting an unarmed
woman holding an infant is what "he was trained to do" and was "within
the scope of his authority" and that he "reasonably believed [it] was
proper" to do so.  What are they teaching at FBI school nowadays?

Horiuchi's defense is really no different than Timothy
McVeigh's: "yes, it was a mistake but he felt it was justified and
reasonably believed at the time that what he was doing was proper..."
Too bad McVeigh didn't have a badge saying FBI on it.
