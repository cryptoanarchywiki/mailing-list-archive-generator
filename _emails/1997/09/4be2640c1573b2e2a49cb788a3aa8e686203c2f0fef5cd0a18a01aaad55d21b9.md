Police think sock is gun, shoot man

MIAMI (Reuter) -- A Florida man who covered his hand with a
sock to work on his car was recovering in the hospital Tuesday after
being shot by police who were told he had a gun. 

Bobby Whipple, 27, had wrapped his hand in a dark sock while
working on his car Saturday, prompting at least two people to alert
police to a man wielding a gun. 

After receiving the reports, 14 officers surrounded Whipple and five
of them, including one using a shotgun that shoots pellets, opened
fire when he did not respond to calls to put his "weapon" down. 

A spokeswoman at Jackson Memorial Hospital said Whipple was in
good condition. 

"Witnesses said that he had a gun and the officers assumed they
were correct ... He took the position of an aggressive stance," said
Pat Brickman, a spokesman for the Metro-Dade Police Department.
"At this point, we don't have any indication that they acted
inappropriately when faced with deadly force." 

The Miami Herald reported that Whipple's attorney was preparing a
civil rights lawsuit against the police department over the shooting.
