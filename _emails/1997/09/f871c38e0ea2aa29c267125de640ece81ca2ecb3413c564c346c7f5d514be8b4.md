According to Raph's remailer stats, the remailers have widely varying
latencies.  Given that only a few remailers have latencies which are
acceptably low, the list of usable remailers is quite low.

If the user of the remailer, Monty Cantsin for example, signs his
messages, a fairly accurate measure of total transit time is obtained.
The total transit time gives clues to the remailers which were
actually used in the chain.  In an of itself, this may not comprise
the user, but combined with other weaknesses it will cause the
attacker to be significantly more confident of identification
hypotheses.

The remailers should all have about the same latency.  0 seconds seems
like a good Schelling point.  What would it take to reduce remailer
latency to under 60 seconds for most of the remailers?  Do people need
old 486s to dedicate to the task?  Do they need money?  Better
software?

If you operate a remailer, please tell us what you need to make it
really work well.  Perhaps the rest of us can help make it happen.
