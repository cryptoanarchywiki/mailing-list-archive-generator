If you're wearing a suspicious-looking RSA t-shirt and carrying lots of
computer stuff, they may ask.  If not, they probably won't unless you 
make an issue of it.  As far as the law goes, there's some sort of exception
for taking out software for personal use that you're planning to bring back,
and not give away to anybody while you're gone.  You have to keep a log of
the times you've done it, but don't have to produce it when leaving.
You may have to be a US citizen to use this.


				Thanks!
