Markoff reports today on the latest GAK ploy:

   http://jya.com/gak-door.htm

Excerpts:

   Government officials disputed the idea that requiring
   decoding technology would necessarily mean the technology
   would be used.

   "There is nothing about putting this enabling technology
   into law that will inevitably lead to it being turned on,"
   said Robert Litt, a Deputy Assistant United States
   Attorney.

   The Administration is now moving on an effort to block
   legislation [SAFE] that is to be considered this week by the house
   Intelligence and National Security Committees. That
   legislation would end Government control over cryptographic
   systems. The Administration proposal is being offered as an
   amendment to that bill.
