That'd only work if all the Post Office employees were armed.
Do they really want _more_ of that?  :-)

Actually, the way they'd probably pull it off, since checks tend
to be delivered by mail, is to open all the mail that looked like
it might contain checks or valuable goods and only deliver it
in return for sales tax payments.  Not that they have the infrastructure
to do that any more either....
