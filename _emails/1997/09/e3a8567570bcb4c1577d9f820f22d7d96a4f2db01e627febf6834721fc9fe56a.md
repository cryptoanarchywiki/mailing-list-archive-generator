(Part 1 of 7)

The latest spin document on resistance to tyranny from The
People's Democratic Republic of Washington requires some
translation to be understood by normal human beings:

A contradiction in terms if there ever was one. "paper
terrorism," to be a meaningful term, would have to be
something like the dropping of 500 lb. bundles of paper
on unsuspecting, innocent people. "Terrorism" means
violent attacks on the populace to instill fear and
uncertainty. Unless someone is killing people with
paper, the subject of this document is pure propaganda.

It is interesting that "they" can only think in terms of
"organizations." It may not dawn on them until it is too
late that the future is one of individual action. No
meetings to spy on. No informants. No membership lists or 
memos to seize.

"Called?" Called by whom? By government? Notice that this
is an example of the definition of a new term to suit those
attempting to suppress opposition. It is a standard tactic.

Note that there seems to be a key admission in the previous 
sentence. She seems to be saying that the tactics she is 
about to describe actually work.

> Commonly, public officials are  personally targeted.   

See various works on the history of the American Revolution
for perspective.

I thought that those frivolous systems of the government
were already overburdened by "normal" business. So now 
thay wish to suppress those whose politics they don't
like by classifying their communications, business,
court petitions, liens and small claims actions as not
only frivolous, but "terrorism." Interesting.

Note that "Intelligence" in law enforcement means keeping
files and lists of names. It means prejudicing victims in
subsequent actions and proceedings. It means targeting
victims for their efforts at 1st Amendment expression and
defending themselves in administrative and judicial
proceedings.
