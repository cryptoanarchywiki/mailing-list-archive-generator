Actually, the legislation will ban sale of nonescrowed crypto immediately
upon passage.

As for existing products, no such proposal in draft form... yet... But if
people can use old non-GAK'd crypto, won't terrorists still us it? The
logical conclusion of the FBI's argument is to ban non-GAK'd crypto
outright. I asked Sen. Kyl, Arizona Republican, why he didn't do this. His
response? He didn't have the votes.

At least two months ago.
