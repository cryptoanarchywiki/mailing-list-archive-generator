For those who still don't know what Tim May means, the barratrous
threats came from the crypto snake oil peddler C2Net and its Arab
owner Sameer Parekh.

Sameer's "product", StrongHold, is a hacked version of the free Web
server Apache, and has more backdoors and security holes than
Swiss cheese.
