We all know that. But there is no way to do this with DigiCash's client
software without going through some difficult hacks, if at all. It is much
easier to rewrite the ecash software. And again, I don't have the time to
explain why to somebody that missed years of discussion. Check the
archives. Or perhaps somebody with more time on their hand can write some
5-10 page intro. Sorry.
