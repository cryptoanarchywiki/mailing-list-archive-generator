um, i don't understand why you think these are 
mutually exclusive. it pretty obvious that 
people with similar interests will get together 
and form virtual communities based on common 
values rather than physical proximity when they 
have access to a communication 
infrastructure like the net. 

accidental and arbitrary interactions is the darker 
side of brick-wall reality, the internet is the tech 
to transcend it. when people have the tech they use it. 

best,
vipul
