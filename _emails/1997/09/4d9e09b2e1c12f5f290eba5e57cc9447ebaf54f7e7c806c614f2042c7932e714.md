                   Howe is 'sickened' by bounty on Internet
                                       
     By Ted Kulfan
     
     The Detroit News
     
        There's a bounty on Gordie Howe's head. And Gordie isn't
     laughing about it.
     
        Howe, 69, is planning to file a police complaint against a
     California radio personality who offered a bounty to have "the old
     fool pummeled back to reality."
     
        The bounty is a reaction to Howe coming out of retirement to
     play with the Detroit Vipers on Oct. 3 against the Kansas City
     Blades at The Palace. He will be playing in his sixth decade.
     
        Jim Rome, a Los Angeles-based sports radio host, is running a
     pledge drive on the Internet and offering the money to any player
     who "drops the gloves with Gordie and lands at least one punch."
     
        On his "Bitter Gordie Howe" web site, Rome called Howe's wish to
     extend his professional career to six decades an "asinine stunt."
     The web-site address is www.jimrome.com
     
        Calls to Rome were not returned.
     
        Howe's wife and business manager, Colleen, said she and her
     husband are "absolutely sickened" by the web site.
     
        "We love the modern technology, but we're concerned about the
     kind of thing we're seeing here," Colleen Howe told the Toronto
     Globe and Mail in Thursday's editions. "There are rich people out
     there who may be enticed into ensuring that some harm is done to
     Gordie."
     
        The Howes could not be reached Thursday night.
     
        Vipers General Manager Rick Dudley said the team would have no
     comment until looking further into the situation.
     
        Wayne Logan, Howe's attorney, said he was in the process of
     filing a complaint with Los Angeles police to stop Rome's campaign,
     which had collected $5,071 as of Sunday at 10 p.m.
     
        "In a time when celebrities are worried about their safety,
     we're concerned about some crackpot who might take a shot at Gordie
     from the stands to collect the money," Logan said.
     
        Logan said the president of the Blades assured him the team
     would not single out Howe.
     
        Rome held a pledge drive last year, raising $6,645 when Howe
     attempted a comeback with the Syracuse Crunch of the American
     Hockey League. But Howe never played with Syracuse. The team, in
     the midst of a playoff chase, didn't want to lose a roster spot.
