This aspect of traffic cover is more complex than it at first seems. Take
for example the second simplest model that I am aware of. For each email
that comes in n bogus emails go out with one remailed copy. So for each
email we receive we end up processing n+2 emails. Since to be useful n must
be reasonably larger than 2 to be effective we are left with a quandry. As
we process more traffic (ie become successful) we find our bandwidth need
growing at a linear rate of n, unfortunately the skills and resources to
support this increase also get larger as we become more successful.
