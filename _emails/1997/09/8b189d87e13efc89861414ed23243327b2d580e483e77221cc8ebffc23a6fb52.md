PRESS RELEASE

Association for Computing

September 8, 1997

USACM APPLAUDS CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE FOR UNANIMOUSLY
ENDORSING RELAXED EXPORT CONTROLS ON ENCRYPTION


As the Congress prepares to address the issue of computer
security and privacy, the California legislature has sent
a clear message that relaxing controls on cryptography is
a critical first step.

On September 5, the California legislature passed a
resolution that calls on the California members in
Congress to support legislation that would make it easier
for US companies to develop and market strong cryptography
products. The resolution was sponsored by Representative
Vasconcellos (D. San Jose) and passed without opposition.

Dr. Barbara Simons, chair of the policy committee for
the Association for Computing (USACM), said that the
California resolution makes clear that industry and
users are united in support of good cryptography.

"We believe that Congress should support the Security
and Freedom Act, sponsored by Representative Goodlatte.
The legislation will help protect security and privacy
on the internet. It will be a serious mistake for the
administration to oppose the development of this
technology," said Dr. Simons.

On August 26, USACM Chair Barbara Simons spoke in support
of the Vasconcellos resolution before a California Senate
committee. Also participating at the Committee hearing were
Dr. Whit Diffie from Sun, Kelly Blough from PGP, Jack Wilson of
ACL Datacom, Chuck Marson representing the California Internet
Industry Alliance (Netscape, Microsoft, AOL, CompuServe and
 Netcom), and a representative of the Software Publishers
Association.  Undersecretary of Commerce Reinsch wrote a
letter opposing the resolution.

The Association for Computing (ACM) is an international non-profit
educational and scientific society with 76,000 members worldwide,
 60,000 of whom reside in the U.S.  USACM, the Association for
Computing's U.S. Public Policy Office, serves as the focal point
for ACM's interaction with U.S. government organizations,
 the computing community and the U.S. public in all matters of
U.S. public policy related to information technology. The USACM
web site is located at http://www.acm.org/usacm/
