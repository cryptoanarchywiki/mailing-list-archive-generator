This Wednesday!!!

   San Diego Area CPUNKS symposium  Wednesday, Sep. 24, 1997.

   Topic:
	What action do we take if the situation get's out of hand (See message below 
from Mark H. below).


   It is my belief that any group, no matter how small, can accomplish great 
things if they apply themselves.  Cypherpunks are not just "users", they 
poses  several additional quanta of the stuff that enables creative thought, 
and skill.  

   Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint.  If you can figure out
how to get it on the back of a business card, that would be cool.  If you 
want
the suspicious crowd there to sign your key, bring two forms of ID.

   
Place: The Mission Cafe & Coffee Shop
       3795 Mission Bl in Mission Beach.
       488-9060

From: Mark Hedges <hedges@infonex.com>
To: all-at-infonex@infonex.com
Subject: federal cryptography legislation
Sender: owner-all-at-infonex@infonex.com

- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

A bill called "SAFE" (HR-695, "Security and Freedom with Encryption") in
the U.S. House of Representatives would have allowed U.S. software
companies to export strong cryptography, and would have promoted privacy
in all U.S. communications. Cryptography is mathematical means of making a
message secret. Now, this bill has been rewritten to introduce more
restrictive cryptography legislation than ever before seen in the U.S.

Public support for cryptography use and export is very strong, as
evidenced by the California state legislature's unanimous vote 9/5/97,
calling on Congress and the President to revise and relax export laws
(SJR-29). Companies world-wide already produce strong cryptograpy
software, and U.S. buisness is rapidly losing ground in the world-wide
software and telecommunications market. 

The House National Security Committee this week voted to continue export
restrictions in the SAFE bill and to install "key escrow" proposals of the
defense and intelligence organizations. This would not only continue the
status quo legislation, it would strictly regulate and restrict domestic
use of cryptography, an unprecedented act. 

Key escrow legislation in SAFE would mandate government "back doors" in
all communications software before the end of the millennia in the United
States, imposing criminal penalties for use of secure cryptography.
Effectively, every citizen would be required to give law enforcement
involuntary and transparent access to all communications, including
financial, business, and personal messages. 

Key escrow also exposes all U.S. communication to a single point of
failure, which a hacker, spy, or corrupt official could exploit to gain
access to all personal, industry, and financial information. 

More information is available in our most recent press release. Press
releases can be viewed at http://www.anonymizer.com/press/. 

Please, call your congressional representatives and senators and encourage
them to oppose restrictive legislation on cryptography and mandated
government access to all communications. Names and phone numbers for your
local legislators can be obtained from www.house.gov and www.senate.gov. 

Sincerely,
