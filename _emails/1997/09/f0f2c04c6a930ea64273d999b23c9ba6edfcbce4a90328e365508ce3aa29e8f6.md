No doubt, with so few data points one cannot build a mathematically
compelling case.

It may be somewhat self-serving but in light of the past few hundred years
history, few (except Italians) would see the founding of Rome as
significant as the invention of democracy.

I think you'd get some major disagreements with that one.

Many historians do not see Constantine's empire as truly the continuation
of the Roman Empire per se, but that of the church (an event which as you
point out began with Jesus).

True, but relatively unimportant.

Sure, but almost any attempt to impose a large-scale structure on history
is likely to come under such critcism, just as theories to explain the
evolution of the universe's large-scale structure can be shot full of holes
by 'local' anomolies (the exception proves the rule). If one accepts that
the socio- politico- economic history may have chaotic aspects (e.g.,
Asimov's pyscho-history) then large-scale structures may be fleetingly
exist.  The true test is whether such attempts help explain or predict.
We'll have to wait a while for that ;-)
