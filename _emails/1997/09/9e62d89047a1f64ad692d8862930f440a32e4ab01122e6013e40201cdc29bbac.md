    yeah, but it does not make Diana any less of an airhead who could
    not take the fire in the kitchen.  Diana expected to be Queen on
    _her_ terms and crumpled.

    they may claim she saved the monarchy by her open, loving self. No,
    she trivialized the monarchy with her problems and hung it out to
    dry --looking exactly as it is/was: another average dysfunctional
    family.
