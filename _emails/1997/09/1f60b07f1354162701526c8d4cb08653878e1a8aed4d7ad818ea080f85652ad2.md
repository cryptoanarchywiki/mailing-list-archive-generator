Sorry to do this to you. This is a love chain letter.  Within 5 days you
>must send it to 10 other people.  On the 5th day a person you like will ask
>you out, or
>>tell you that  they love you.  If you do not send it you will have problems
>>in future relationships.  It has been going since 1877 and hasn't
>>stopped since.

>>
>>Around the corner I have a friend,
>>> In this great city that has no end,
>>> Yet the days go by and weeks rush on,
>>> And before I know it, a year is gone.
>>> And I never see my old friends face,
>>> For life is a swift and terrible race,
>>> He knows I like him just as well,
>> As in the days when I rang his bell.
>>> And he rang mine
>>> if, we were younger then,
>>> And now we are busy, tired men.
>>> Tired of playing a foolish game,
>>> Tired of trying to make a name.
>>> "Tommorow" I say "I will call on Jim"
>>> "Just to show that I'm thinking of him."
>>> But tommorow comes and tommorow goes,
>>> And distance between us grows and grows.
>>> Around the corner!- yet miles away,
>>> "Here's a telegram sir"
>>> "Jim died today."
>>> And thats what we get and deserve in the end.
>>> Around the corner, a vanished friend.

>> Remember to always say what you mean.  If you love someone, tell them.
