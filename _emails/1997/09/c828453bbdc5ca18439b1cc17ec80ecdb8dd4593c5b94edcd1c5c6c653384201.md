The SanJose Mercury News interviewed Senator Dianne Feinstein for today's 
paper.
She gave a good answer on why encryption is im[prtant for protecting our 
privacy,
then segued into why Law Enforcement needs access to it.
Q:"Doesn't government control of encryption technology used by American 
citizens
infringe on their constitutional rights?
A:"No one is talking about intrusion on privacy rights".... telephone 
analogy...
"Encryption is already being used by criminals, terrorists, and drug cartels.
THe terrorists who bombed the World Trade Center had plans to blow up 11
American commercial airliners.  Encrypted files detailing these plots were 
found
on one of the terrorists' computers.  Imagine the tragedies that might not be 
prevented if Law Enforcement officials are unable to decode encrypted files
when necessary."
Q on her district strongly wants encruption
A: "California's high-technology  industry is one of the most potent economic
and technological forces in the world.  The industry is being asked to develop
this technology in a way that does not take away Law Enforcement's ability to
protect public safety.
	People's safety must keep pace with new developments in technology or we
will live to regret it.  I understand the desire, the need even, for companies
to be competitive in a world market.  In this case, the industry is being 
asked to
put people's safety ahead of their bottom line.  It's that simple."
