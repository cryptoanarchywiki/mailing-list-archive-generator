Feinstein answers her critics in the usual way slimy politicians
answer critics: Dodge the crucial details and make broad, sweeping,
feel-good but substance-less statments.

>
> 3.  Feinstein, like many politicians, does not want to deal

> It's difficult to force a coward face reality and answer to
