Send me cash / check / money order with your PGP key fingerprint attached,
and I will allow you to send up to 100KB anonymously per day for $10 /
month. Or something like that. (Once the plugin is installed on my machine,
of course.) The plugin should  have tools for maintaining the list of
authorized users, with the ability to delete unwanted to-be-remailed
messages directly off the POP server without downloading them.

You should be able to override the default choice, but having the computer
doing the grunt work will nake using the remailing feature more convenient.

What is uuencoded can be trivially uudecoded to determine the content type
by direct examination of the data. (uuencoding != encryption) And if all
.wav files are mandatorily "noise filtered" by your friendly ISP, then the
answer would probably be yes.
