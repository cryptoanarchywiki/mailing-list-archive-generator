(Toad.com address changed to algebra.com. Hugh Daniel confirmed to me that
about 130 subscribers are still using the toad.com address. And he
confirmed that none of them are getting the traffic sent to the "real"
Cypherpunks lists, those at algebra.com, cyberpass.net, and ssz.com. I
again urge folks to get with the program. Toad.com is going to vanish
someday, at least as any kind of distribution site for CP traffic.)

By the way, today is the 50th anniversary of the National Security Act,
which created the National Security Agency and the United States Air Force,
amongst other things (some of them probably still secret).

I doubt Clinton will be at the Fort Meade HQ for a ceremony, as he's on his
way to Stanford, where both of us will, amazingly enough, be tomorrow. Wish
me luck!
