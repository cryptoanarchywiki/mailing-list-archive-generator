Probably a sensible opinion.  But what would be the effect of pulling 
in the other direction?  Espcially if the population would be more 
personnally concerned with it?  The way it is now, National Security 
is a scarecrow but the real thing is the govt corn to be protected...

Only, to deploy any e-$ scheme would need an environment where govt 
would _tolerate_ crypto.  But the way it is going, everything is set 
in place to trample on anybody's face that will use crypto with the 
"not-the-flavour-of-the-month-at-White-House" sauce such as e-$ 
programmers, etc.  

If the debate could be shifted-off, the legitimacy of the govt 
claimed goals could get strongly challenged.  This is possible only 
if there is a cause that concerns citizens directly.  Now, try 
telling me that taxation is the most popular of govt's measures...  
The fact that a majority voted for Politician A does not mean 
that a majority loves him...

Precisely.  IMO, there is more hidden under there than meets the 
eye.  What if we try prying at this tiny, well concealed crack in the 
big wall?
