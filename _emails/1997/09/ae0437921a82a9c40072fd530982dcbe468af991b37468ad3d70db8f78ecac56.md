What evil lurks in the heart of the Internet?  AltaVista Knows....

Besides www.systemics.com, which has free Java crypto
there's also www.baltimore.ie which has commercial Java crypto as
well as some free downloadware.  

However, Baltimore's web pages also talk about how they're the winner 
of the EuroTrust TTP/CA development contract.  Sigh.
