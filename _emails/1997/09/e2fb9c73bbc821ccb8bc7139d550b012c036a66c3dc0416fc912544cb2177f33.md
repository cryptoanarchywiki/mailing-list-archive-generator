As the Acting Chairperson of "Access to Tickets for All People," ATAP, I
was disappointed to see so many relics of the Sixth Industrial Capitalist
Era in this press release.

Allow me to comment:

ATAP applauds this choice of a keynote speaker. Based on his company's
[censored by ATAP lawyers] products, which some have characterized as a
form of snake oil, it is apparent that he will not soon become a Greedy
Capitalist. Or at least not a rich one.

ATAP demands that all who wish to attend this conference receive tickets
without charge. Fair is fair.

ATAP thinks this writer needs to take more SF classes. ATAP has never heard
the neologism "clickstream." Perhaps high tech has been taken over English
majors, intent on outyounging Mr. Young?

What about Access to Tickets for All People? What is this nonsense about
charging money in a money-free, post-work era?

ATAP says "Steal this Event."


>Co-Sponsoring Organizations:
>Department of Computer Science, UCB
>School of Information Management and Systems, UCB
>International Computer Science Institute
>National Writer's Union

Which explains the "clickstream" stupidity. But not "face time" or
"competing for eyeballs."

>Access to Software for All People

>AIR:  United Airlines is the official airline of the conference.
>For a discount rate, call 800-521-4041 and refer to Meeting ID Code: 520YA

I assume that United is providing free tickets for all people?

(A puzzle: If we are in a post-work age, who is flying the planes?)

>HOTEL:  Some rooms have been reserved at the Shattuck Hotel, in downtown

The Shattuck Hotel will presumably be providing Access to Rooms for All
People (ARAP, as in "That's ARAP.).

What's all this stuff about money in a post-money, post-work,
clickstreaming age?

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
