Let's get into modelization! So, let's put first things first.

First, you shouldn't say e$ but $, because it is what thoses you 
call "the rich" have.

Now, does e-$ would permit govt to behave the same way as 
they do now?

How do they win?  By the use of coercion (and this is why guns 
should not get registered).

Out of what hat did you got that one? Who said so and why?  :-)  
My opinion is that your remark is falling into the same category as 
the the old fallacy saying "everything is uncertain but death and 
taxes".

Statistically, yes.  But it doesn't intrinsically generates *envious* 
poors.  But that is a discussion about Values and Ethics and their 
link to emotions and nobody who's not an Ayn Rand fanatic or 
who doesn't have a few more terabytes of disk space to spare doesn't 
want to get into it...  :-)

It depends on which moral code the legislative authorities base their 
actions.  But the sentence "a large group of poor will always try, 
within a democracy, to justify the muscling-in on the rich 
transactually-acquired wealth" would be true.

True

This one for-the-time-being reason why crypto should be deployed.


The true answers will be found in the nature of the data exchange 
system, it's robustness and reliability, and the impact of dropping 
the govt out of the money loop.  Sometimes, an invention can change 
the face of the world.  Mathematics did, gun powder did, the 
printing press did, the microprocessor did, so why not crypto?  And 
what is the most Joe Everybody consumer-oriented use of crypto?

P.S. Anybody who has a clue about modelizing the effects  of a 
behaviour/entity (use of e$) that hamper the survival of 
another one (govt) in a complex system, please drop me a line (any 
micro-biologists online?)
