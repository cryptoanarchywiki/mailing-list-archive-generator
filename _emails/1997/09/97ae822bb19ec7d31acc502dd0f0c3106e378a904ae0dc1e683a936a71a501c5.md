Our old pinko buddy Vigdor Schriebman is the latest to attack Old Media's
definitions of "journalist" at

"The Internet Ushers In New Age Of Personal Diplomacy" at 

http://www.infotech.co.nz/current/ntchil.html
               
          "Individuals around the globe can reach a consensus and make
          contact with others despite the differing political views of
          their governments. They can become "personal ambassadors" for
          their countries."
                       

And the Infowarspooks are back for another round of "the Internet is so
important the government needs to do SOMETHING" at
