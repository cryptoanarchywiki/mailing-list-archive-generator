This is blatantly unconstitutional and breaks new ground that the
government has never even dared hint at before. 

The true agenda of the GAKers has finally been disclosed to the American
public.

Next they will want copies of all of our house keys for the jackbooted
thugs to hold, and emergency Assault Plungers in all our umbrella stands
ready for the cops to ram up the citizens' assholes. 

This is not simply a proposed bill.  It is an ACT OF WAR.

It is them or us.  I pick us.
