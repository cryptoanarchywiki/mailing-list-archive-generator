Does that mean Goodlatte's original bill, or the bill as amended already by 
the National Security Subcommittee?

I believe you should be more specific in your instructions -- suggesting 
that people ask for the bill to be voted against unless it is exactly as it 
was prior to the Natl Sec involvement.  ..or, assuming it's going to be
amended and we can't stop that, ask people to ask for a vote against the
bill -- not for it.  I'm worried that the person on the phone will check the
box under "vote for" and not puzzle out the amendment level.  If bills
changed number when amended, this wouldn't be such a problem -- but as it
is, I really worry.
