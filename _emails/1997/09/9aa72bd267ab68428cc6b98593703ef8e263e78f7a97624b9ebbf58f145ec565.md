Incorrect, Citizen Unit Choate.  Firemen do not put out fires, where did
you come up with such a notion?  All houses are fireproof.  Firemen burn
books. Books are evil.  Have you any books Citizen Unit Choate?  Perhaps
hiding in your toaster, or oven, or a cored out television set?  Perhaps
books on crypto?  Bend over to the state, Citizen Unit Choate - of course
we will remove the appropriate fines from your savings, the Firemen have
to be paid, of course, and the victims of your evil books have to be
compensated.  The poor congressmen and TLA agents..
