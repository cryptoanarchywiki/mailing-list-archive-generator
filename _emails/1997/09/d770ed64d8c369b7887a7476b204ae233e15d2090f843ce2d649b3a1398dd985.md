   At the risk of asking the obvious .... what ever happened to
parents supervising their kids ... I know all the reasons ... mod and
dad working etc .... but I teach school, and here in Vermont I still
run into families with two breadwinners who actually know what their
kids are doing ... (sadly, not as many as I wish I would meet; and
since my job is working with 'at risk' students 98% of the parents I
deal with have no clue as to what their kids are doing)

  The joke of the whole thing is that most probably the kids will know
how to manage the 'controls' better than the parents and they will use
the V-ratings and controls to figure out which shows they will find
'most interesting!'
