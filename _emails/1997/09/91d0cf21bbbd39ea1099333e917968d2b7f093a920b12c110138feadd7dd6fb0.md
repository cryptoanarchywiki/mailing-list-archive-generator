What's wrong with the idea of digital postage?  What else do you have in
mind?


There are a couple of problems that arise when money in any form gets
involved:

1)  refunds:  If one remailer in a chain fails to deliver a message, How
does a user get a refund without having the message traced back to him?

2)  Business/Gov't dishonesty:  Imagine if 50% of all remailers are owned
and operated by the same company.  Now imagine if that company did not have
the same morality/ideaology as we do.  Now imagine if that same company was
LEA friendly. I don't think I need to tell you why this is a bad thing.
