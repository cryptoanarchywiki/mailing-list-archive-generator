After:

PGP Building Access:

This is an Open Meeting on US Soil and it is free for anyone to attend. 

      There is a minor building security formality due to the facilities
        being in a bank building:  anytime after 12 noon, approach the 
        Bayview Building's Information window (in the plaza, see below for
        directions), and ask the Guard on Duty to let you up to the 
        2nd Floor for the Cypherpunks meeting (use the passphrase 
        "cypherpunks release code"). If you have any difficulty
        (eg. if the guard is on a break), simply call DDT at +1 415
	730 3583 he I'll let you in. 
      You can arrive at any time during the scheduled meeting hours, 
        though earlier is better if you want to hear the interesting stuff.

  PGP encrypted mail preferred.
  DES is dead! Please join in breaking RC5-56.
