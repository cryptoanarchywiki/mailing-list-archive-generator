Thanks to everybody that showed up for today's meeting. Much is happening.
And it is not just the evil legislation moving through Congress.
Cypherpunks have been busy writing code. A very useful Ecash implementation
compatible with DigiCash's protocol will be released next week. Onion
Routers have been ported to Linux. Other semi-clandestine projects are
moving forward as well.

Again people asked me where to find some pictures from the Cypherpunks
field trip to HIP'97. One more time: all archives are accessible via
http://www.hip97.nl/

Some of the better archives are Joichi Ito's pages at
http://www.ito.com/mpeg/hip/ which amongst other things features an MPEG of
myself as a DJ

Next, check out the HIP'97 network site at http://spin.vpro.nl/hip.shtml
You have to go a few levels deep before seeing the usual suspects.

And you haven't lived until you see the RealVideo of Brian the HIP Brain
http://magazine.dds.nl/XArtikel.phtml?ArtID=156&KatID=7

In fact, there are about five or six articles about us on this
semi-official HIP journal site. http://magazine.dds.nl/XKaterng?KatIDnu=7

Have fun,
