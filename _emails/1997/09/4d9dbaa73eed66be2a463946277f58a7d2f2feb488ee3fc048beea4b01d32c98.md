The FCC yesterday proposed rules that would give television manufacturers
until
July 1 1998 to put V-Chips in half of new TV sets with monitors 13 inches
or larger,
and in all sets by July 1, 1999.  Reed Hundt said that this will
"ensure that V-Chip technology does in fact exist in a relatively short
period of time".
Industry officials protested that the time limit is way too short for
manufacturers,
saying they need 18 months - 2 years.  Comment period runs until November.

Meanwhile, some of the major TV networks are going to a more detailed
rating system,
Sex/Violence/Language/SuggestiveDialog, with a FantasyViolence category for
kids' shows.
NBC is resisting that.
				Thanks!
