Is there an eternity server named "Forever Young?" Perhaps someone
should start one up, and use it a place to send posts that don't really
belong on any particular mailing list, because no one can quite figure
out what they mean, but should be available to read somewhere, because
they clearly say something that it is important to know, but nobody can
quite figure out what it is.
The web site could carry a "Je Ne Sais Quois" rating.
