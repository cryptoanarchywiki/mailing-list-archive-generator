I understand alcohol is legal now, so it worked once for one drug.

The drugs ban isn't all that meaningful, anyway.  You can go into any
major U.S. city without any connections and score crack within three
hours if you look the part and know what you are doing.  I've known
many drug users and abusers over many years and none have gone to
jail.

Software doesn't weigh anything and it doesn't take up much space.
Trafficking is trivial.  The flow of tools will not stop.

What will stop is open development by the software industry and this
will cause irreparable damage.  Fortunately, the industry does form a
wealthy constituency.  If it becomes clear that restricting particular
classes of algorithm significantly hampers business, look to seeing
these bans lifted.
