Someone at work today told me that if these couple lines were sent
in an email to someone overseas, that we might go to jail for it???

Well, Looie -- you are in washington, and John, you are in
Australia -- does that now mean we all three will have to go
to jail together?????  Please confirm.

Kissy Poos to you both...      syniker.
