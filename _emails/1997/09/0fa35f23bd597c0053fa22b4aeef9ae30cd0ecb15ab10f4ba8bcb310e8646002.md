It's worth looking closely at the Cryptography Key Recovery
System (CKRS) documents published recently as part of
the FIPS KMI program. A meeting is scheduled next

See the listing of the August Meeting reports at:

   http://csrc.nist.gov/tacdfipsfkmi/

They show how far the key recovery program has advanced.
