Well I am not really worried about the "court approved" wiretaps as these
are only a small fraction of all surveillance currently being done by the
Government on it's citizens.

A much more worrisome issue is that of the FBI,CIA,NSA,et al having the
ability of driftnet fishing of communication. Once Big Brother takes an
interest in you its all over but the crying. Even if they can't get you on
what they want they will get you on something else. With current system we
are all felons under numerous laws (yes even you Kent) some are just less
aware of the fact than others.
