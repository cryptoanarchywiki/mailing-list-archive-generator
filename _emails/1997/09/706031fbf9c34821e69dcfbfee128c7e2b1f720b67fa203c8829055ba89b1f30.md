<shrug> Rather, my position is that the system is ALREADY hopelessly 
corrupt and imbalanced;altering the letter of the law to say '20 
years' as opposed to '10 years' FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T BE A 
CRIME AT ALL is irrelevant. The government can just as easily create 
two trumped-up ten year charges as it can one 20 year charge;'law' 
and 'justice' have nothing to do with one another anymore.

The whole concept of criminilizing the use of crpytography is 
offensive;the exact specifics -- 10 years or 20 years -- are pretty 
much the same.

Though, on second thought, there is a serious issue with it -- if, as 
we hope, encryption becomes widespread, than anyone doing anything 
will be using it;including 'in the commission of a crime'. This could 
make petty misdemeanors into 20 year federal crimes, and THAT is 
something to worry about. Hm.
