	Recall "Secret Power," a book on the UKUSA agreements on joint
electronic surveillence of the world, in which New Zealand
participates.

	When NZ announced itself to be a nuclear free zone, the US
announced a cessation of shared intelligence activities.  It turns out
that this was utter bunk, and the work never hiccupped.

	If intel cooperation ceases, look for large cargo ships
carrying home US hardware.
