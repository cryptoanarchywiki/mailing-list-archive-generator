    I wouldn't say that we are that small of a minority. There are many 
folks out there that feel the same way that we do. I know of a large 
community in Kentucky, USA that feel that the government is slowly  trying
to institute a police state. (And no, I do not mean a militia,  though
many of them are friends that I had the honor of serving with in  the US
Army.)  The viewpoint that I am trying to get accross comes from  looking
at history. Although many groups that went against governments  were in
fact wiped out, they left an indeligible mark on the minds and  attitudes
of future generations. Some even to the point of creating  another
generation of "freedom fighters" that actually forced the  government to
radically re-evaluate it's stance on certain items. (There  are too many
incidences of this to mention, though the slave movement in  Rome, and the
Spartan soldier revolt do come to mind.)        What is to  say that with
the physical fire-power of today, and good old fashion  American grit such
as was shown at Iwa Jima by the US Marine Corp, we  could not show the
Government that we could not change their minds? I  personally would hate
for things to come down to that level, yet it  seems that they are forcing
us more and more towards that path.  (Please  don't misread my statements.
I do not advocate the overthrow of the  government. I merely am commenting
on the fact that the factors which  contributed to the American Civil War
becoming a reality are once again  present today. If another war should
break out today... let's just say  that is one nightmare I'd prefer *not*
to have!
