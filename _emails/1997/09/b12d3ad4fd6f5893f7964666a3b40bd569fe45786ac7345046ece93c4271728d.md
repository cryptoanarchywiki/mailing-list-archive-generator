It'd be such a shame to just let Toto's latest rantings go homeless, so of
course I've given them a home.  Postings for the "InfoWar" chronicle will be
put up at http://bureau42.base.org/public/infowar3/ .  I haven't done a nice
index yet, and I'm not likely to do so for a while.  New chapters will be
posted in a more-or-less "as I get around to it" fashion.  If two people
submit a chapter with the same number more or less simultaneously, I'll
probably put up the one that's more entertaining.  (I'll probably put the
others up too, though. :)
