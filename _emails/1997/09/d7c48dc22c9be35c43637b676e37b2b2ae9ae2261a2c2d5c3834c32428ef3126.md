Exactly what happens in India. Dont ask for permission, ask for 
forgiveness. The govt doesn't want to sanction it. This could 
be becuase they might want to declare usage illegal at a latter time, 
or currently dont have the infrastructure to tap into people's 
communication, or the investment in such infrastructure is 
not justified at this time or they realize how entirely stupid 
it would be to legally restrict crypto usage. Whatever such 
a stand implies it manages to keep venture capitalists away from 
crypto products. 

best,
Vipul
