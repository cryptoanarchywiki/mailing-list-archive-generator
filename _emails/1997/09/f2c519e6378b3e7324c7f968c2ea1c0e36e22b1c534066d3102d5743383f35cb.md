>speakers in  the anti-government extremists or "Patriot" movement
>conduct recruitment  and information  seminars across  Washington
>State, as  well as  the  entire  country.    These  seminars  and

>communicate  new  trends  within  the  anti-government  movement.
>Paper terrorism  has grown  from a  trend to  a full scale tactic

>
>
>Background
>
>Paper terrorism  is designed  to clog  government  services  with
>meaningless requests  which consume  time and  disrupt schedules.
>In the  private sector  paper terrorism  is an  attempt to extort

>
>*    Bogus liens  placed upon  personal  property  of  government
>     officials and private individuals.
>
>*    Frivolous lawsuits filed in state and federal courts against

>
>*    Drafting and  passing  counterfeit  bank  checks  and  other
>     fraudulent negotiable  instruments aimed  at defrauding  the
>     financial community and businesses.
>
>*    Common Law Courts that issue homemade subpoenas to citizens,
>     businesses and government officials.
>
>*    Challenging judges  in an  effort to  disqualify them  on  a
>     current case and to repeat their motions to disqualify these

>
>*    Scheming to  avoid paying  state sales tax during a purchase
>     by declaring  to be  a non  resident and  then filing claims

>
>*    Disrupting  the  court  system  by  persuading  fellow  jail

>
>*    Distributing the  extremist Citizens Handbook to foster jury
>     nullification.
>
>*    using the  Internet  to  promote  extremist  ideas  such  as

>
>*    Filing bogus claims in small claims court.
>
>*    Requesting information  from  courts,  government  agencies,
>     elected officials  and businesses  in the  form of frivolous
>     questions in an effort to consume employee's time.
>
>
>Tell-tale signs of Patriot extremists can often be found in their

>biblical passages,  referring  to  the  state  as  a  "republic",
>calling zip codes a "postal zone", refusing to acknowledge direct

>has no  authority, or  using the  phrases:   all rights reserved,
>without prejudice,  UCC 1-207,  pro se, sui juris, united states,
>Black's law.
>
>
>Analysis and Trends
>
>These anti-government  extremists and  supporters  are  convinced
