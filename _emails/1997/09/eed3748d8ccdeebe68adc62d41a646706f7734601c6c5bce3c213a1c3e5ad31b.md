*** Keep cyberporn from children, Flynt daughter says

Anti-pornography activist Tonya Flynt-Vega said Friday she was "very
disappointed" the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a law meant to keep
Internet smut away from children. Flynt-Vega, 32, daughter of Hustler
magazine founder Larry Flynt, said children tended to be much more
computer-literate than adults and were especially prone to "unwelcome
contacts" on the Internet. " ... I want there to be some laws
regulating that stuff. Don't put it in my face or my child's face,"
she said. The Supreme Court ruled June 26 that Congress violated
free-speech rights when it tried to curb smut on the Internet. For

Powell lingered. "How's Earth?" 
It was a conventional enough question and Muller gave the 
conventional answer, "Still spinning."
