Some of you might find an article in the San Diego Daily Transcript (I
think
it will appear tomorrow in the print version; it's up now at their website)
interesting.
It's an article about today's moderately good news from Congress, and I'm
quoted extensively in it.  (The reporter is an old friend of mine, and he
knows
what I do for a living, so he called me for a quote.)   It's currently at

http://www.sddt.com/files/library/97headlines/09_97/DN97_09_24/DN97_09_24_tb
c.html

and I *think* they will keep it up for a while.
