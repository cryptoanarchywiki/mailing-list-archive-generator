Hi,

A friend of mine has been working on a radioactive RNG and while playing
with it a potentialy interesting application came to mind. In short, by
placing radioactive RNG's in some sort of grid across an area it becomes
possible to track radioactive sources by comparing the magnitude of a
correlation function between them.

This could be extended to include just about any kind of RNG that is
sensitive to some environmental factor, say air pressure or magnetic
intensity...
