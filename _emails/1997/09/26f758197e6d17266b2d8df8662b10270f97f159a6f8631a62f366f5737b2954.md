   Stanford Newspaper Promises to Help Chelsea Clinton Keep Low Profile
   AP
   08-SEP-97
   
   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) Don't look for news about Chelsea Clinton in
   Stanford University's school paper: The editor is promising to treat
   the first freshman like any other student.
   
   Chelsea, accompanied by her parents, is expected on campus Sept. 19,
   when 1,600 first-year students move into their dormitories and begin
   several days of orientation.
   
   Like the mainstream media, the Stanford Daily plans to cover the
   Clintons' arrival and their participation that day at a welcoming
   ceremony for freshmen and their parents.
   
   But after that, said Carolyn Sleeth, the Daily's editor in chief,
   Chelsea "will be treated by us as a student, a regular student."
   
   That means her classroom and social life will largely go unreported.
   
   "Of course, if she involves herself in a newsworthy event, we'll cover
   it for example, if she founds a Stanford Democratic Club," Sleeth
   said.
   
   On the other hand, the student editor said if Chelsea were to get a
   speeding ticket or violate some minor campus rule, it would be
   ignored.
   
   "We wouldn't do a story if another student got a speeding ticket,"
   Sleeth said.
   
   Sleeth also said a gag order of sorts will be imposed on Daily
   employees, barring them from talking or as she put it, "punditing"
   with the "outsider press" about Chelsea. Anyone who does so will be
   fired, she said.
