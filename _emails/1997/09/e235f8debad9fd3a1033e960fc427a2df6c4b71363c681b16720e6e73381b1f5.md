This spammer was pissed off at ml.org because they cancelled his account,
so he mailbombed a bunch of people via enterprise.net, an ISP which caters
to spammers.

I drop everything with an X-UIDL or X-PMFLAGS header in it.  I don't know
why, but spammers often flag their junkmail as such by putting one of
these lines in it.  It sure makes it easy to delete the spam...
