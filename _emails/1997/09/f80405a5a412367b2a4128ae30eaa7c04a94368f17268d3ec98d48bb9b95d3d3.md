Many of us spent much time fighting this. I don't recall hearing your name
in any of the efforts.

The effort this time around will better be spent deploying crypto widely,
not seeking to influence voters and citizen-units.

Part of why Clipper was not successful is the smear campaign we
successfully mounted against it, making it "uncool" to work on
Clipper-related projects, to use Clipper products, etc. Also, we used
anonymous remailers to great effect, distributing the contents of
Mykotronx's dumpsters to the world, showing their complicity, their
payoffs, their deals with government agencies, etc.

I count these as "monkeywrenchings," and I see them as different from
fruitless efforts to sway _public_ opinion.
