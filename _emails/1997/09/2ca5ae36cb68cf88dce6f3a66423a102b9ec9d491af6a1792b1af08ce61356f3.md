For what it's worth, I once got an opinion from NSA's export control office 
that I could use any kind of crypto I wanted (e.g., even triple-DES) if all 
I'm doing is protecting a channel carrying a password (like the PIN), 
because that's an authentication function and therefore to be encouraged.  I 
didn't get this in writing, however, so I'd have to go for it again.
