Do I understand you correctly in that they are planing to double the
dracoinian 5/10 year proposed penalties to 10/20 years?

I don't know if I should be happy or sad about Declan's recent tone of
writing. "Forget about working /with/ DC". I certainly never wanted to be
right. There was a time Declan at least hoped that /some/ good might come
out of DC. It doesn't seem he thinks this anymore.

Hell, Declan almost sounds like Tim a year ago. Will he contribute to the
suitcase fund a year from now?

BTW, sponsors wishing to remain anonymous have raised the pot to $820,000.
This is by far the highest I have ever seen it.
