Radio Shack.  It's called a FM Wireless Microphone.
You can probably get one for less than 20 bucks.
You can then take the shell off of this, probably a little black rectangle
or a childs toy microphone, and you will have a nie little circuit board.
Battery life is a problem, but you can work out a solution to that depending
on where you put it.
Hide it either on the underside of surfaces below eye level or on the top
surfaces of objects a foot or so above head level.

They sell some more dedicated hardware out of the back of magazines like
popular science and popular mechanics.  Look for advertisements that claim
that thier product can BROADCAST UP TO A HALF MILE and show a picture of
something next to a quarter.
