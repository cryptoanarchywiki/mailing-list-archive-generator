PGP Building Access:

      There is a minor building security formality due to the facilities
	being in a bank building:  anytime after 12 noon, approach the 
	Bayview Building's Information window (in the plaza, see below for
	directions), and ask the Guard on Duty to let you up to the 
	2nd Floor for the Cypherpunks meeting (use the passphrase 
	"cypherpunks release code"). If you have any difficulty
	(eg. if the guard is on a break), simply call DDT at +1 415
	730 3583 he I'll let you in. 
      You can arrive at any time during the scheduled meeting hours, 
	though earlier is better if you want to hear the interesting stuff.
