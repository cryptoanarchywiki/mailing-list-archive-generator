 ... hmmmm,  immediate *lawful* decryption ... which implies that they 
plan to end run the Bill of Rights with some law that permits them to 
walk in and snoop on the spot ... right now to look at my mail which 
needs no key, just a teakettle, they at least have to stop somewhere and 
find a tame judge, which removes at least some of the immediacy.
