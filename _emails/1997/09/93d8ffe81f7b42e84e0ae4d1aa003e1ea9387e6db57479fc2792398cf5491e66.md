Here are a few programs which haven't been mentioned here before.  They take
C/C++ code and compile it to FPGAs, which might be interesting to someone
who's working on, oh, say RC5...

The first is at http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/EECG/RESEARCH/tmcc/tmcc/
and compiles C code to Xilinx or Altera FPGAs.

Another is at ftp://lslsun5.epfl.ch/pub/nlc*
It uses a slightly different syntax and targets Xilinx chips.

There's also a routing optimizer at
http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~lemieux/sega/sega.html

http://193.215.128.3/freecore/ gives plans for building a programmer to
load designs into Altera FPGAs.


While I not sure how well-optimized the output from such software is, it
is interesting to note that someone with relatively basic electronics and
computer programming experience could put together a massively parallel
key-cracker.
