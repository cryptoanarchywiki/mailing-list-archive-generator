Oh I wouldn't be feeling to optimistic with that. We in the
crypto/anarchist community are a very small minority. Our govenrmnet would
have no qualms at all of taking us out. A nice little Reichstag Fire to
turn popular opinion against us and then the storm troopers will be sent
out. If you are expecting some type of popular support of "us" against
"them" I think you are sorely mistaken. The majority of the sheeple would
be all to happy to turn in those evil cryptologist for their 5min of fame.
