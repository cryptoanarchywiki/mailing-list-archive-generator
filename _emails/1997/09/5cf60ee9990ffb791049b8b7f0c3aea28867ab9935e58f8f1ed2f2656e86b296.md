	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) - A Tel Aviv court on Thursday temporarily
banned the sale of a book about a missing Israeli submarine after state
prosecutors claimed it endangered national security.
	Hundreds of copies of the book were ordered off bookstore shelves.
Author Michael Eldar said police searched his house and confiscated
several copies of the book as well as other documents.
[...]
	The case is unusual because the manuscript had been approved, as
required of all security-related material, by Israel's military censor.

hi,

I am a journalism teacher and an editor in Israel. A friend of mine, 
Captain Mike Eldar, Israeli Navy (Ret) asked me 18 months ago to edit 
an autobiography and a book he wrote. During 1997, both books were 
published and suppressed by the Israeli military.

Please, help us to fight brutal censorship in Israel. Support freedom 
even in this remote part of the Middle East.
