There was a story a few weeks ago about how the various
federal bueracracies are not keen on giving their keys to ANY sort of 
"trusted third party" whether it is a psuedo private or overtly gov't 
entity.  They don't trust each other and are of course interested in 
being able to keep their own dirty little secrets to themselves.  
They seem to realize that the plan gives the administration and it's 
FBI, Stalanesque powers over every other dept, as well as the 
citezenry.

Then earlier this evening,an administration spokesman, issued a press 
statement distancing the administration from Freeh's testimony 
in  an effort to deflect some of  the  resulting  fallout.
