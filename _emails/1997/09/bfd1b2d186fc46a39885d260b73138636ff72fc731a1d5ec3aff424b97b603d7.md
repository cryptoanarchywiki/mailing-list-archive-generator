Dimitri, please forward your original message complaining about being
misquoted in my Netly article. I don't remember such a thing. Of course you
were whining in general back then, but that's hardly surprising.

I've never styled myself as a "freedom fighter." I do support property
rights, and the right to do what you want with your own computer is
certainly one of those.

Feel free to read f-c. The archives are publicly available on the web, and
have been for years.

Unless Vulis says something interesting, this will be my last response to
him. Sometimes it's not worth it to dignify a post with a reply.

-Declan
