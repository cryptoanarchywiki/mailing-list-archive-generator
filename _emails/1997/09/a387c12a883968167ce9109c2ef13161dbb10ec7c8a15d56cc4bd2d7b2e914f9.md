I was recently notified by a bank that issued one of my credit cards that 
my card number had been sold, along with thousands of other account 
numbers, to an undercover FBI agent. The bank canceled my account, opened 
a new one, and overnighted a replacement card. No big deal, and no loss 
to me.

OTOH, it *might* have been in response to a different incident. Keep 
those paranoid rants coming.

-r.w.
