Based on what I've seen so far, the account numbers were more likely to 
have been obtained from the databases of merchants than from banks. If 
the bank was cracked, there would have been many more card numbers from 
one bank on the CD, rather than a distribution of account numbers issued 
by many institutions. I doubt that someone managed to crack a dozens of 
banks, and then took only a few thousand numbers from each. It is more 
likely that "widgets R us" was compromised, resulting in a few thousand 
accounts from each of the major banks.

I suppose I could look back over a few year's worth of statements, and 
tell you where *not* to shop, but I'd be listing all merchants I'd done 
business with as being equally guilty, when it is very likely that only 
one was compromised.

My guess is that Smak had inside access to a particular merchant's 
system, but I've been wrong before.

-r.w.
