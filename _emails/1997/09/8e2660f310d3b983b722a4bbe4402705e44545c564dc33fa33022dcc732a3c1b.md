Haven't you ever heard of ZPG? The problem with Medicare is that the
taxpayers are paying to keep the old people alive, no matter how close to
death they are!! Then, on top of that, we give them free money!

Come on people, we already have nigh 6 billion people on this planet, I
think we can stand to lose anybody over 65.

As for the less fortunate, welcome to Evolution 101: Survival of the
Fittest, where fit means good education, good job, and enough money to
giev your kids the same.
