Most excellent. Now, all we need to really put some fear in them and make 
them clamp down so hard it will be noticable to the average sheeple, is an 
actual prediction and collection. For that, of course, we need genuinely 
anonymous digital cash.

I guess the founders of this nation were also "Patriot extremists"!

Quoting the U.S. Constitution, Article IV ...


	"Section 4. The United States shall guarantee to every state in
	this union a republican form of government, and shall protect
	each of them against invasion; and on application of the
	legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be
	convened) against domestic violence. "

Those words are supposedly the law of the land. The only thing "guaranteed" 
by the constitution is "a republican form of government". I suppose quoting 
the constitution also marks one as a "Patriot extremist".

I certainly hope so!

Well, they have this part right.

How can someone remain isolated these days? With television and radio 
everywhere you look, and the mass media constantly telling how great 
everything is?

Most excellent... I suggest we call this office and report paper terrorism 
on the part of the IRS!
