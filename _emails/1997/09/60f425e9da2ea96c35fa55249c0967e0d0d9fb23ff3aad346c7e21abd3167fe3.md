Perhaps we can elaborate on this.  Judging from their actions, what
they want is a full blown police state.  They've seen the product, now
they want one of their own.  This is obvious to everybody on this
list, but sometimes people are coy about it, probably in an effort to
appear to be "legitimate".

This transcends the issue of crypto, although the problem will be more
manageable if the use of crypto remains legal.

What we are seeing is the fight for survival of the institutions
created during World War II.  Their only purpose now is self
promotion.  This was universally recognized ten years ago when the
Wall fell, but somehow the "peace dividend" never materialized and
they got another trillion dollars out of us.

We can look at Russia and see just how hard it is for a society to
free itself of these sorts of institutions.  How much of the Russian
"Mafia" is composed of fragments of the KGB?  This story can be read
again and again throughout history.

What is different in 1997 is that the technology of mass surveillance
and population management is superior.  What is at stake is whether we
remain a free people or whether we end up with ear tags like cattle.
