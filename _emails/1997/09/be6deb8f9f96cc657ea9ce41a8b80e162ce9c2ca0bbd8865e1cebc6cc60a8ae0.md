Agreed.  But this is a feature to be added later, not one to stop us
from using ecash now.

I would also note that LE is not the only group of people that might
be interested.  Aside from various spook agencies (which are not law
enforcement agencies), there are all sorts of other scary people in
the world who should be kept out of one's financial affairs.
