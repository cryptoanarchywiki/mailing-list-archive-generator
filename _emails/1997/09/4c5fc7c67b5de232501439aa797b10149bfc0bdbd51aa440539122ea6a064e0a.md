Well, like I said before, I hope to send a signal like this next Friday,
the 19th, at Stanford. (Seems the Fascist in Chief and his royal entourage
will be visiting campus that day. What an amazing coincidence.)

But I don't think you'll find too many law school students involved in such
activism. My hunch, and I've dealt with some of them, is that their minds
are on the law firms they hope to join, not on issues of "right" and
"wrong." (In fact, and Prof. Froomkin is free to correct me, or the legal
larvae can, issues of "jurisprudence" are passe. Even the "ethics" they
study seems to be more related to keeping their hands out of the cookie
jar, to avoiding being sued by unhappy clients, and to not getting caught
in ethics violations.)

As Shakespeare might have said, "First, we mcveigh all the law schools."

Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
