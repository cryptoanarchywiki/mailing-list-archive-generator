Did you ask if it was a U-Haul requirement or a Texas one?

If you've ever given your SSN when applying for a credit card,
you can be pretty sure they've got your SSN in the credit report.
Perhaps if you've got a secured debit card of some sort
you've been able to keep it separate from your other credit history,
if any, but most people have slipped at least once, or had an account
at a bank that collected the SSN for tax reasons and then included it
in credit reports.

What U-Haul actually does with it is probably just keeping the
credit card number on file, since actually doing a credit report
would cost them more money than they want to spend on you
unless you haven't returned the trailer or there's a big kaboom.
They may also sell the transaction record data they do have.
