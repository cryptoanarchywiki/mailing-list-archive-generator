Thanks to Willis Ware we offer the full text of the
FBI's August 28 "technical assistance draft" for encryption
legislation, a few paragraphs of which Declan posted here:

Although prepared to revise McCain/Kerrey's S 909 to satisfy 
law enforcement, it's the source for the various amendments 
to SAFE which copied much of it unchanged, and some portions
not yet lifted may foretell what's coming.
