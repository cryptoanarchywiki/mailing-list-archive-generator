Yes, it was covered.  One chief's wife was commended on her bravery and
self-sacrifice for giving her blanket to another woman, (and subsequently
freezing to death, or something similar.)  The blame was pinned on
sub-contractors who were charged with feeding the Cherokee people but who
often didn't, or who often left the food out hours in advance to spoil.
In this particular Oklahoma history class lesson.  Not once was an Oklahoman
held responsible for the death of so many people.  Most of it was given to
the people occupying the states between Oklahoma and, I believe, Florida.
