  We have already been declared 'Future Outlaws' by one of the major
figureheads of the secret government.
  I am not waiting until 1999 to 'officially' become an outlaw. I am
starting today.
  If we have learned but one from our journey to this point in time,
it should be that by the time it's 'official', it's too late...
