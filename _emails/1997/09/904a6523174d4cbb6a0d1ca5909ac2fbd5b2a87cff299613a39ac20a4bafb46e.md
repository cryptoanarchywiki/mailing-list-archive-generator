Freedom of speech is protected by nothing stronger than the cluelessness
of our masters.

If you publish your idea in appropriate forums, you can get away with it.

If you go from forum to forum singing your idea like a broken record, 
and flogging it like soap, you will probably go to jail.

I see no point in explaining our ideas so thoroughly and repeatedly
that even cops and politicians start to understand them.
