But, presumably Raph waits awhile for the message before deciding the
machine is down?  If I understand correctly, you are saying that
messages don't actually disappear, but they are sometimes delayed for
longer than the two days Raph waits* for them to come back.

(* Assumption made on the basis that his timing data doesn't describe
any delays longer than two days.)

It could cover the cost of that second line.  ;-)

If you haven't tried ecash, you might enjoy it.  Setting up your
remailer to accept it is a lot easier than you might think.
