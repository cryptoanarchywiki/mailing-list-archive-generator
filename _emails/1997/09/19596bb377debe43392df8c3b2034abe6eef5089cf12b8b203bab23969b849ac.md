We offer recent exchanges between Peter Junger's
attorney and BXA on the several encryption classification 
requests Peter described here a few days ago, including 
"twiddle," "fiddle," non-US PGP, ROT13, Adam Back's 
3-line of Perl RSA, Paul Leyland's one-time pad, RC2 and 
RC4, and crypto links to foreign sites:

And the original Junger v. DoS (now Junger v. DoC) 
case filings:
