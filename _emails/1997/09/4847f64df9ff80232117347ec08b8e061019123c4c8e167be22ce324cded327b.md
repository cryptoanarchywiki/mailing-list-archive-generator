Tim,
Sorry I called you senile (even though I enjoyed it), since it turns
out that I was too senile to respond to your "can they do this? can
they do that" post with as good an example as above, as to what the
government can and cannot do.
After Pat Robertson becomes President, we can look forward to "Marilyn
Manson" having his/her 'encryption' fall under the ITAR and EAR rules,
regulations, restrictions, etc., etc., etc.
