Imagine how many tragedies could have been prevented if we had a
telescreen in every home and office.  Not just bombings, but murders,
spousal abuse, child abuse, drug use, uninformed political
decisions...

People have been making bombs and blowing things up for about 100
years.  Until now this has been a manageable problem without mass
surveillance.  What happened?  Did the price of fertilizer drop?
