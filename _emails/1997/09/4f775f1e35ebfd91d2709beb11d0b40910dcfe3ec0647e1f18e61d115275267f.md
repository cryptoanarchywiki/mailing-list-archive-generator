The Eudora plugin should support remailer chaining and PGP encryption for
personal messages, as well as give the user the opportunity to BE a
remailing service.

How about posting availability notices alt.remailer-availability.announce
(create it if necessary) or alt.anonymous.messages?

The remailer plugin should be able to:
1. Scan all available sources of remailer availability / reliability.
2. Allow the user to select a pool of trusted remailers.
3. Allow the user to select the number of remailers in the chain.
4. Randomly select remailers from the pool.
5. Encrypt / add headers to the outgoing message to match the selected
remailers.

Look for AOL and other ISP's to automatically run a "noise reduction"
filter (as in CoolEdit 96) on .wav / .jpg files if GAK becomes mandatory.
CoolEdit's noise reduction filter is great for removing tape hiss and other
constant background noise from sound files, (it can make a cheap tape deck
sound like a cheap CD player) but it would obviously destroy any stegoed
data. The noise reduction algorithm is very processor intensive--it takes
my 586/133 about an hour to NR a 3 minute stereo 44 KHz recording, but I'm
sure you could set up a "light" version of the filter that would destroy
stego data without taking as long.
