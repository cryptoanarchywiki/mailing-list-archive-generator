We are not talking about an abstract "what will the market do" issue
here.  We are talking about how to get a working payment system up for
remailers which gets us great service and provides privacy and
security.

The rest of the world may or may not catch on to ecash, but if it's
going to start, it will start with a small group.  I think it should
be this one.

Businesses use multiple forms of payment all the time, even in the
United States where multiple currency use is legally discouraged.
When I go to a restaurant I can pay in cash or use a variety of credit
cards.  And credit cards cost the establishment a substantial amount
of money and headache, too.

I hope we are all assuming that The Enemy knows who is using
remailers, at least at the moment.  There's no hiding those telltale
PGP messages sent to a certain short list of suspected remailer
addresses.  Some day we will have good steganography and it won't be
possible to tell who is using a remailer, but this is not the best
problem to solve right now.

No it doesn't.  Watch carefully:

See if you can figure out which remailers accept money and how much
they accept.  Now, in figuring that out, did you do anything that
would reveal your identity?  Do you think a simple program could
handle the task?

Also, the remailer can still offer free operation, but it can give
nonpaying customers lower priority, delaying their messages by a few
hours, for example.  This means remailers still have a low barrier to
entry, but people can also pay a little money to get excellent
service.

You might be.  I'm interested in smart people who want to protect
their privacy.

Mind your manners.

Then look around.  For the last few hundred years just about
everything has been dropping in price.  And, in the computer and
information industry in particular, prices drop like crazy all the
time for decades, even when you adjust for inflation.  Buy memory
recently?

>A quarter a message per hop is about 2,000+ times too expensive to

If you want to run a remailer and charge a fraction of a cent for each
message, or for an account, or whatever, please be my guest.

>The key to anonyous remailers is not the cost per message but rather

That is obviously untrue.  Remailers are used by a small highly
specialized market of perhaps a few hundred people.  Some day, if we
do good work, there will be millions of users.

Can you think of any mass market which started out as a mass market?
I can't think of a single one.  But, there are lots of mass markets
that started out with a small group of people paying fairly high
prices.  As time went by, the prices dropped, more people came in, and
eventually a mass market developed.

Untrue.  You just have to know what each remailer charges.  That's
about as hard as knowing what services it offers or that it exists.

I may be misreading this, but you do realize ecash is anonymous,
right?  Nobody can tell who sent the money, just who received it.

Perhaps you are arguing that The Enemy would notice that you withdrew
a bunch of coins and then make a guess that all those remailers making
deposits three minutes later are depositing your coins?  That is
easily solved by generating the ASCII ecash certificates once a week
or so and then pasting them into your messages when you send them.

What justification issue?  Ecash is available right now.  You don't
have to justify it to anybody, just use it.

Hopefully, once the cypherpunks start using it regularly, it will
begin to catch on with people peripheral to the group, and then with
everyone.

You seem to think that because the cost of transporting mail is
inexpensive, the price for protecting somebody's identity can't be
high.

The only models that have been proposed so far require a lot of work
and evangelism.  Ecash doesn't require much work, and it will be
easier to evangelize.
