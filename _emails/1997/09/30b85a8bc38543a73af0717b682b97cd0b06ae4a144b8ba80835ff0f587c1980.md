Robert;
This is a rather long post.  I wanted for you to see it personally.   It is
important and I wanted to clear it thru you.  If I don't see it posted I
will know
you did not chose to post it.
Best personal regards,
Bill GL Stafford

>the IRS in a restructuring of its computer systems.  The IRS admitted to
>Congress last January that its $4 billion, 11-year attempt to modernize

>
>     Finally I landed on the IRS's page -- specifically, its page

>its PRIME project.  There were pages of blue links to documents, each
>one with a strange name or the name of a state.  It was not clear to me at
>first what I had discovered.  So, I started clicking links. I found
>nothing that I could understand, link after link: government bureaucratese.
>Then I hit pay dirt: the mother lode, my friends -- what we have been

>IRS'S MAINFRAME COMPUTERS -- 63 OF THEM, PLUS MICROCOMPUTERS -- ARE ON
>THE BRINK OF TOTAL COLLAPSE.  Yee-hah!
>
>     This amazing admission appears in an innocuously titled document,
>"Request for Comments (RFC) for Modernization Prime Systems
>Integration Services Contractor" (May 15, 1997).  The author is Arthur
>Gross, Associate Commissioner of the IRS and Chief Information
>Officer, i.e., the senior IRS computer honcho.  It was Mr.  Gross who
>went before Congress in January to admit defeat.
>
>     Mr. Gross now says that the IRS is no longer capable of operating its
>own computer systems.  The IRS has over 7,500 people involved in just
>computer maintenance, with a budget a $1 billion a year (Appendix B.
>p. 2), yet they can no longer handle the load.  And so, says Mr. Gross,
>some of them are going to get fired.  You can imagine the continuing
>morale problem that this announcement will cause!  The IS (information
>systems) division will be, as they say, DOWNSIZED.  From now on, the
>IRS must achieve the following:
>
>           . . . shifting the focus of IS management to a
>           business orientation: servicing customers with
>           exponentially increasing technology needs,
>           implementing massive new technology applications
>           on schedule within budget while managing the
>           downsizing of the IS organization
>           (Appendix B. p. 2).
>
>     Do you think that people slaving away in their cubicles, trying to fix
>the Millennium Bug, will respond favorably to this notice?  "Fix it, and
>then you're out!"  Mr. Gross knows better.  So, with this amazing
>document, he calls on private industry to come in and TAKE OVER
>THE ENTIRE IRS COMPUTER DIVISION.  This is what Mr. Gross
>calls "a strategic partnership" (p. 1).  The new partners will have to fix
>the Millennium Bug.  The IRS will give them exactly eight months, start
>to finish: October 1, 1998 to the end of June, 1999.

>
>     Perhaps you have had trouble on occasion getting information from
>the IRS about your account.  After reading this document, I now know
>why.   The information is held in what the IRS calls "Master Files" (p.
>4).  These files are held in the Martinsburg, West Virginia, computer.
>This computer receives data sent in by 10 regional centers that use a
>total of 60 separate mainframes.  These mainframes do not talk to each
>other.  Or, as Mr. Gross puts it, they are part of "an extraordinarily
>complex array of legacy and stand-alone modernized systems with
>respect both to connectivity and inoperability between the mainframe
>platforms and the plethora of distributed systems" (p. 4).  This is
>bureaucratese, but I do understand the word, INOPERABILITY.
>
>     The tax data build up in the local mainframes for five business days.
>Then they are uploaded to West Virginia.  This may take up to 10 actual
>days.  Then the Martinsburg computer sends it all back to the regional
>computers in the Service Centers.  Then the information is made
>available to the "Customer Service Representatives" (p. 5), i.e., local tax
>collectors.  The elapsed time may take two weeks.
>
>     But . . . it turns out that the actual source payment documents are
>not sent to the Master Files.  Neither is "specific payment or tax
>information."  This information stays in what the IRS calls
>STOVEPIPED SYSTEMS, meaning stand-alone data bases "which, for
>the most part, are not integrated with either the Master Files or the
>corporate on-line system, IDRS" (p. 5).  Separate tax assessments for the
>same person can appear in six separate systems, and these do not
>communicate with each other (p. 5).  "Further, each system generates
>management reporting information which is not homogeneous, one with
>the other . . ." (p. 7).  To help us visualize this mess, and much larger
>messes, the document includes charts.  These charts are so complex that
>my printer was unable to print out the 116-page document -- probably
>not enough RAM.  I had to get two other people involved to get one
>readable copy.
>
>     I have included one of these charts on the back page, just for fun.
>Go ahead.  Take a quick look.  No need to get out your magnifying glass
>just yet.   Then comes the key admission: "These infrastructures are
>largely not century date compliant . . ." (p. 11).  The phrase "century
>date compliant" is the government's phrase for Year 2000-compliant.  In
>other words, THE IRS'S COMPUTERS ARE GOING TO CRASH.
>Now hear this:
>
>          In addition to three computing centers, (Memphis,
>          Detroit and Martinsburg) the latter of which is a
>          fully operational tax processing center, the IRS
>          deploys a total of sixty mainframes in its ten
>          regional service centers.
>
>          None of the mainframes are compliant, thereby
>          necessitating immediate actions ranging from
>          systems software upgrades to replacement (p. 9).
>
>It gets worse:
>
>          A still greater and far reaching wave of work
>          in the form of the Century Date Project is
>          cascading over the diminishing workforce that

>          historical levels of workload.  For the Internal
>          Revenue Service, the Century Date Project is
>          uniquely challenging, given the aged and non-
>          century compliant date legacy applications and
>          infrastructure as well as thousands of undocumented
>          applications systems developed by business personnel
>          in the IRS field operations which are resident on
>          distributed infrastructures but not as yet
>          inventoried (p. 13).
>
>     Notice especially two key words: "undocumented" and "inventoried."
>"Undocumented" means there is no code writer's manual.  They either
>lost it or they never had it.  "Inventoried" means they know where all of
>the code is installed.  But it says: "not as yet inventoried."  How much
>code?  Lots.
>

>

>correcting the agency's 30 million lines of code.  By mid-1996, they had
>completed repairs on 6 million lines (CIO Magazine, Sept. 15, 1996.)
>Got that?  It took five years for them to fix 6 million lines.  But the IRS
>has 62 million lines THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT, but they don't know
>about the rest.  It's out there, but there is no inventory of it.
>
>     Consider the fact that they have not completed their inventory.  The
>1996 "California White Paper," which is the y2k guide issued by the IS
>division of the California state government's y2k repair project, says that
>inventory constitutes 1% of the overall code repair project.  Awareness
>is 1%.  So, after you get finished with inventory, YOU HAVE 98% OF
>YOUR PROJECT AHEAD OF YOU.  Meanwhile, the IRS has not yet
>completed its inventory.
>
>     The IRS has led the American welfare state into a trap.  The Federal
>government, like the U.S. economy, will be restructured in the year
>2000.  Most Americans will be in bankruptcy by 2001, but they will be
>free.
>
>     Meanwhile, the news media are all a-dither about the Clinton-
>Congress accord on taxes, which will balance the budget in 2002.  As
>George Gobel used to say, "Suuuuuure it will."  Who is going to collect
>revenues in 2000?
>

>
>     I'll summarize.  The IRS has got bad code on 63 aging mainframe

>know how much code it has.  It must now move ("migrate") the data
>from these y2k noncompliant computers -- data stored in legacy
>programs that are not y2k compliant -- to new computers with new
>programs.  These computers must interact with each other, unlike
>today's system.  Bear in mind that some of this code -- I have seen
>estimates as high as 30% -- is written in Assembler language, which is
>not understood by most programmers today: perhaps 50,000 of them,
>worldwide (Cory Hamasaki's estimate).  Then everything must be tested,
>side by side, old system vs. new system, on mainframe computers, before
>anyone can trust anything.  (This assumes that extra mainframes are
>available, but they aren't.)  Warning:
>
>     Beyond the magnitude of the applications system migration, the
>complexity and enormity of the date conversion that would be required
>necessitates careful planning and risk mitigation strategies (e.g.,
>parallel processing).  While the risks inherent in Phase III may be nearly
>incalculable given the age of the systems, the absence of critical
>documentation, dependency on Assembler Language Code (ALC) and
>the inevitable turnover of IRS workforce supporting these systems, it is
>essential to plan and execute the conversion of the Master Files and its
>related suite of applications (p. 30).
>
>     I'll say it's essential!  The key question is: Is it possible?  No.
>
