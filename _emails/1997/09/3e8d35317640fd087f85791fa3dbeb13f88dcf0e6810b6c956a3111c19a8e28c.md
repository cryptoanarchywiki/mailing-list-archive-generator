This is not the way I understand it.

You can re-export strong crypto from Canada, you just have to inform
the appropriate Canadian government department that you have done so.

So procedure is: 1) import software from US, 2) write appropriate
Canadian export department telling "I'm going to export blah to xyz
corp offices in Ireland", 3) export it.

That is, there is a loop-hole, you don't have to ask permission for
export, you just have to inform them you're going to do it.  (You
might want to check this out with a Canadian lawyer familiar with the
rules, and loop-holes).

So you informed them.  They can't do anything about it.  They won't
like it, but they don't have to.

I'm told Kerebos was exported by this route.  US -> Canada -> UK.
100% legally.
