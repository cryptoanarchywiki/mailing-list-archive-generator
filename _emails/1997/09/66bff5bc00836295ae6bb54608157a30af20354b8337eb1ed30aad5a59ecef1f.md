No intrinsic flaws in democracy? 

Surely you jest. 

Democracy is 2 wolves and a sheep getting together to decide what's for 
lunch.

Please feel free to peruse Article 4, section for of the U.S. Constitution 
at http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/7500/const.htm#cIV4 
The authors of this document "guarantee" only one thing, that is a 
republican form of government. When I hear congresscritters and media 
whores singing the praises of "democracy", I want to puke.
