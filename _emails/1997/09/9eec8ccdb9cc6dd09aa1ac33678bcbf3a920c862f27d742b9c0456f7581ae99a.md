In effect as you get more popular your traffic becomes easier to track.
I don't think I would use a remailer that advertised this 'feature'.

Traffic analysis is something that is easily automated so the measure of
success (to my mind anyway) is what sort of resources would a mallet need
to get a solution versus the time frame that solution might we relevant.
Admittedly this is a very sloppy area of remailers, I am not aware of any
analysis with anon. remailers in mind.

If anyone does know of a source please cough it up...
