They're really foaming at the mouth back in 'ol DC.  Lets see:

(1) Free speech is dead.  c.f. Judge Pattel's opinion in the Burnstein case.
(2) The right to a public trial is gone too.
(3) The right to privacy is forgotten.  Close those clinics.
(4) If crypto is an armament, then the right to keep and bear it is gone.
(But that right was already in tatters.)
(5) The right to be safe from unreasonable search is gone if you can't
challenge a search in the courts.
(6) etc. etc.

And over what is merely the practical application of some obscure
mathematics, these turkeys are willing to trash the constitution they are
sworn to support and defend.  It would be really funny if it wasn't so grim.
