 I don't know if the law is still on the books, but when I was an 
undergrad at Univ of Penn in the 60's you could not buy a water 
pistol/squirtgun of any kind, because there had been some incidents where 
people were squirted in the face with ammonia bu a couple of miscreants, 
so the city council took it upon themselves to 'protect' us all!
