And this is a good thing?

It would be a real boon for privacy if they were posted to the
internet.  The fall-out ought to reduce government reporting demands.

Bingo!  What you don't want published don't publish.

Don't like it?  Don't reveal information you don't want published.
Argue for chaumian credentials.

btw. your "you are saying if I can get them, I should be able to
publish them." is almost a tautology -- clearly if you get information
you _can_ publish it anonymously.  Therefore anything that is
obtainable is not private.  

Laws claiming to regulate what you can _know_ (data protection laws)
are dumber yet, as it is legislating that you must forget something.
And it is unenforceable -- who knows what you have on your database.

Copyright doesn't prevent squat.  It just sets up a procedure for your
local force monopoly to harass you if you don't follow the procedure.

More laws against gravity.

Scrap patents and copyright.  Disband WIPO police.
