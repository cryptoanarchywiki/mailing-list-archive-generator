Things are heating up even more. At this morning's National Security
committee markup in the House, SAFE will be hit by an amendment sponsored
by Weldon and Dellums. It doesn't focus on key recovery; rather it likely
will delay the effective date of the act. "We need the time for our
defense and intelligence agencies to prepare," says one source who drafted
it.

No committee member, even the SAFE cosponsors, has said they'll oppose it.
