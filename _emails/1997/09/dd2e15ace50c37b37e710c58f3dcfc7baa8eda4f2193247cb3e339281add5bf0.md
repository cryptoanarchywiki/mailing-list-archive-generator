The snow-monster saw a peppercorn through the 
vacuum-packed keyhole, it's extra mouth kissing
the fresh fruit and chewing the rough.

The blizzard continued to whip the darkness, 
while the snow-men sunned in the warm glow of 
particle fear and unicity gaps.

It remained as cold it as and hot.
