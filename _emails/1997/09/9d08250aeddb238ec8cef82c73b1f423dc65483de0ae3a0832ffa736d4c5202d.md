I have seen California law code which seems to indicate that speech
directed at an individual is not covered under the first amendment.

If you have any thoughts on the matter, please send opinions (not legal
advice, of course, if you are a lawyer). Also, if you know of any speech
rights scholars or lawyers willing to answer a few related questions for
free, I would appreciate the pointer. 

Thank you.
