Divx Protects Content, But Not Your Liberties
			
The ability to create pristine copies of any digital work is seen as a
threat by some Hollywood studios, which are experimenting with a new
pay-to-play DVD format to protect their intellectual property. This format,
Divx, could conceivably hobble the video rental business, but some see its
real threat as an invasion of consumer privacy - and the freedom to view
information anonymously.
