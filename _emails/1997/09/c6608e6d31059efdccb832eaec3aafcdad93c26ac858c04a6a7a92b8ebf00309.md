Well, I dunno. About 18 months ago, I was involved with the 
negotiations over the exportability of an SSL equipped web
server I had helped develop. The export model used 40 bit RC4
and 512 bit keys. The initial version used 3DES to encrypt 
stored private keys, and this was turned down. I modified it to
use single DES, and it passed.

Note that this was for secret key storage only.
