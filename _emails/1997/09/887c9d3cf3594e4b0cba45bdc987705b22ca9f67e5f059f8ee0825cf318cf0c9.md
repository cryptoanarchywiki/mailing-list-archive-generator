    no, no, no --we dont try to make GAK 'better' --we dont do it
    at all. fuck them and the dirty horses they road in on.  

    _THEY_, not us, are the four horsemen of the apocolypse.

    to the despots in Washington, whose fat heads have never seen
    the sunshine, there is only one "gift"  --no code. let them
    find the dirty handed clods to do their own filthy work --if no
    decent programmers are willing to bloody their hands they will
    butcher the program more than they would otherwise, and it will
    be those miserable bastards who will be begging _us_ for mercy.

    if you believe in any freedom -dont be a fucking quisling.

+ Please correct me if I am wrong, but could not a GAK backdoor be

+not encryption. Would not this prevent this from happening?

+  Don'tget me wrong. It scares the hell out of me too, but maybe, in
+addition to that various things Tim has suggested we might also
+consider how to make the GAK as secure as cam be to minimize its
+potential for disaster.
