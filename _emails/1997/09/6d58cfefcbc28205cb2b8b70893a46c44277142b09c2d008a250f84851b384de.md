	I think the point, Zooko, is that the sniper didn't 
"accidentally" kill the woman and her baby. It was a deliberate 
shot. If it wasn't a deliberate shot, then not only is the 
shooter criminally negligent, but so is the person who handed 
him the rifle.

	There is no (or little) hatred of individuals here. There
is hatred for ideologies, beliefs, and points of view. I don't hate
you. I don't know you. I might hate you if I knew you, it is a 
stastically probability, but until we meet, who knows. I DO hate 
big intrusive governments. I don't see the problem there. 
	
	I do hate the politics of the Big Lie, and the politics of 
mob rule. I don't see the problem there. 

	I do hate spending 1/3 to 1/2 of my working hours supporting 
lazy good for nothing bums. No, I am not talking about welfare reciepents,
I am talking about Government workers. I don't see a problem with this.

	Post a challenge, not erroneous "facts".
