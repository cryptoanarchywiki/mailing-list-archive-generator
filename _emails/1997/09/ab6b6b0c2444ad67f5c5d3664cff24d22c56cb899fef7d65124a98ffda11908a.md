Officer Volpe is back on the job, on modified duty minus his badge and
gun.  Apparently the union contract prohibits suspensions over 30 days in
length. 

Gee - you'd think someone like that would be in jail on multimillion
dollar bail as a "suspected sex offender."  If he is convicted, will laws
require him to register for life and notify his neighbors when he moves in
next door to them? 

I certainly wouldn't want this sadistic pervert with his fixation on
minority anuses living next door to me.  If he weren't a cop, they
probably would have searched his house immediately looking for evidence of
other crimes.  I'll bet Officer Volpe has a really unusual porn and dildo
collection.
