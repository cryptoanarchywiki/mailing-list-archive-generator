Zooko fails to take into consideration that the FBI's role in the
affair was to back the unnecessary fascist actions of those who
had decided it was their right to interfere in the life of a family
which was largely minding their own business and seeking to live 
their lives free from constant subjection to a wide variety of often
senseless and/or meaningless, arbitrary laws.
