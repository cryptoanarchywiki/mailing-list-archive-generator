    the even more ominous (and ridiculous) demand which Freeh
    (apparently even more emboldened) is presenting:

        "...And Louis J. Freeh, the director of the FBI, raised
        the prospect of also requiring Internet service 
        providers to have keys to the data flowing over 
        their networks. "Law enforcement needs to have a 
        system for immediate decryption" when a judge 
        determines it is likely that crime is being or 
        is about to be committed, Freeh told the 
        Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and
        Government Information. "We should also look at     
        whether network service providers should have a 
        system for immediate decryption." ....

    this is nothing short of demanding _three_ key encryption,
    with the third key a _universal_ master key for the men who
    claim they wear the white hats, but tinker with the facts in
    their "crime" labs --whose crime?  "ours" or theirs?  Given
    the historical perspective on abuse of power by our federal
    government (and everybody else down their food chain), this
    is patently absurd --yet they WILL try for it.

    asking Congress to evaluate the technology of information
    exchange, let alone the nuances of encryption, is a waste 
    of effort in the shitstorm of Louis Freeh's inflammatory     
    predictions of the four horsemen.  There are not more than a
    handful who have the intelligence to do much other than collect
    bribes.

    why dont the bastards admit it?  all they really want is to wire
    our brains, implant an ID, and enable GPS on us.


 "Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other."     
        --Benjamin Franklin
