"Excuse me, Mr. Man On The Street...would you give an IRS auditor the keys
to your house, without him telling you if he would ever use them or if you
were being audited?"
"Of course not!"
"How would you feel about the government requiring that when you buy a
lock, you have to give a key to the IRS, and that they ought to be allowed
to sneak into your house at will, without you even being notified you've
been charged with a crime?"
"That's absurd!"
"Well, that's what they're trying to do now."
"I'll write my Congressman or woman right now!"

<SETH>And here we see more of the cult's recruitment. Note how he always
talks about the *GOVERNMENT* and the *IRS*. Why doesn't he talk about Pepsi
or GM wanting the keys to your house? More of this 'government bad,
business good' propaganda we've all grown so sick and tired of, being
shoved down our throats. Small wonder this list has gone to hell!" </SETH>
