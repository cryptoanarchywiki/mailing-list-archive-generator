I hate to tip folks off as to my column for tomorrow, but that's exactly 
what I'm doing in it.  I have written that if the Feds try to impose 
key-recovery crypto on me, I'll start using some encryption program that 
doesn't comply with the law, and I'll send copies of the messages to the 
Feds, so they can come and arrest me.  If I really thought they would, I 
wouldn't have written it!  But I'll stand by it.

Anyway, I don't presently encrypt my mail.  No reason to--I ain't no 
pedophile...;-)
So if I want to send crypto I must find some partner in crime.  Any 
volunteers?
