Le Brain Drain

In the age just past, a nation's natural resources were
the key to its success; today it is its intellectual capital.
And with the world linked like never before, nations
must nurture intellectual capital lest it walk away.
But don't believe us.  Ask our friend Olivier.

When Olivier Cardic figured out that if his electronics
company were based in England his 1995 net profit
would have been $300,000, compared to just $80,000
in France, he decided to do what 1,000 French
entrepreneurs have done already.  Move.  In the era
of globalization, voting with your feet becomes a pretty
easy stroll, especially when the country you're in is
France.  Consider this:  British employers pay 10.2%
of salaries in payroll taxes, compared with an insane
46% in France.  According to Jean-Pierre Letouzet,
president of RGA Systemes, a systems engineering
company, "We live in a Marxist system.  France has
never been capitalist.  We're not prepared for
globalization, and we're sinking."

Last year, Cardic asked French authorities on national
radio to, "Explain to me why it is better to be
unemployed in France than a worker in England?"
The French authorities didn't have an answer for him.
Neither do we.
