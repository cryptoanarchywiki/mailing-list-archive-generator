That's hardly comforting (not sure if it was meant to be). I work four or
so blocks from the White House and spend a good bit of time in the Capitol
and related buildings. My office is in the densepack lobbyist warren
territory on K Street.

I do live, however, about a mile and a half from anything especially
targetworthy.
