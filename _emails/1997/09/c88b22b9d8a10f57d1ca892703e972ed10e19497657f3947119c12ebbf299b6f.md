In other news, Nazi Party officials disputed the idea that
requiring all Jewish showers to be "gas chamber enabled" would
necessarily mean that the technology would be used.

"There is nothing about putting this enabling technology into
law that will inevitably lead to it being turned on," said SS
Obergruppenfurher Reinhard Freeh, a deputy assistant Reich
Chancellor for Racial Hygiene. "From the National Socialist point
of view, this is simply a better way to provide for our eugenic
safety."
