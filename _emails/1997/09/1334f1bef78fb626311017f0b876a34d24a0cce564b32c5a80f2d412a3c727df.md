Don't disregard them too quickly.
I can't remember the name of the fungus, or the toxin extracted from it,
(and my science and technology encyclopedias are 2 hours away), but there is
a common fungus found in soil.  This is the stuff that can survive high temp
treatment.
IF memory serves, it's botulism, that is no guarantee.
Anyway, this toxin was listed in the text that I have access to as being one
of the strongest known to man.
And it is literally under your feet.

Of course I don't know how to distill it, but I could probably make some
guesses.
