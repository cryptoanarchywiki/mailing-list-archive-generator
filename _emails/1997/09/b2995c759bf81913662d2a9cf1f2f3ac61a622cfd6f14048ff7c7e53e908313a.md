 We have batted this around and around ... I am curious though what
the more legal-oriented among us feel the current wording portends for
us ... say it gets passed ... just what will be the legal status of
the use of non-GAKked crypto?

   There is little question that steganography will be raised to a
high art form under these proposals. That not withstanding, I would
just like to get a feel for exactly where it leaves the current PGP et
al. community?
