For another good read, try "The Truth Machine", by James L. Halperin.  It's
about a guy who invents Big Brother (a machine that can with 100% accuracy,
detect whether you are lying).  It's kind of scary, because Big Brother (in
the book) brings an end to war, world government, and general Utopia.

When everyone is armed, criminals fear everyone, not just the police.
