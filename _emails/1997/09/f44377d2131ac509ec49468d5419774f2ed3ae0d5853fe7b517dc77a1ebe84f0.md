The Dagens Nyheter reported yesterday that a US citizen,
Mr Ritt Goldstein, is in Sweden asking for political asylum.
Alledgedly he has been systematically harassed and persecuted
by US police after organizing resistance against police
violence and brutality.

The NYPD 'zero tolerance success' has recently been praised
here as something for the Swedish police to learn from. Luckily
the 'up yours' story surfaced soon afterwards.

The latest crypto policy news here says that Sweden will not
go along will mandatory GAK. In the long run there is little
hope for European resistance to the New World Order, though.
Only France has nuclear warheads out of US control and France
is The Enemy as the leading proponent of an EU Superstate.
