Further, he could give pointers to Private Idaho, John Doe, etc.,
and encourage the use of anonymous tips to the newsmedia. Since
I operate a cyberspace parking garage (the WinSock Remailer) and
since the Lippo Administration is the most Nixonian since Tricky
himself, I would think that the major media would be up-in-arms
over threats to anonymous communication over the web. After all,
which reporter-team doesn't want to be the next Woodward and
Bernstein? I can understand (while not agreeing with...) my local
rag's opposition to the second amendment, but the total apathy
shown to dangers faced by the first is hard to fathom. I read the
Herald pretty carefully, yet there has been NOTHING this week on
the crypto-controversy. Nothing. While I often disagree with the
Miami Herald's reporting decisions (both substance and emphasis)
it is rare that I find it this scary. <sigh>

P.S. When *Seth* said, "(and wow, do they like to rant on every
issue)" about Libertarians, my irony-meter broke its needle.
