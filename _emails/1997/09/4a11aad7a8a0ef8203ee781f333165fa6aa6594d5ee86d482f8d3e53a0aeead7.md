Jeez.  I'm glad I sold all my Cerf shares at www.roguemarket.com

Its amazing that Cerf doesn't even understand the implications of the
network that he designed.  Or maybe he does understand and just
doesn't like the fact that big bro is getting cut out of his future 
utopia.

Yes and they've done such a good job protecting the public's safety
and well-being.  I don't remember the constitution spelling out 
anything about "governments rights".  Just the feds and states
limited powers.

If paranoia was on the agenda, someone would be shouting 
New World Order at this point.
