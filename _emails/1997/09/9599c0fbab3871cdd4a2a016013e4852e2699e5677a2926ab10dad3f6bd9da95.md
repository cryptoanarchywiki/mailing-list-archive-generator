This is quite understandable.

There is very little teaching of the Constitution or of Government in
public schools. Many years ago when I was in HS Civics entailed a 1
semester course 1/2hr a day in your senior year. While American history
may still be taught in the public schools it is done so by socialist who
have no interests of enlightening their students of the reasons this
country was founded or the philosophies that it is founded on.

We are paying today for allowing the socialist/statist taking control of
the education of our children 30 yrs ago.
