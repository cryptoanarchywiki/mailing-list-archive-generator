Actually, the current trick is to launch a little rocket-powered cart with
some form of electronic measure under the fleeing car from behind.  It
fizzles the electronics pretty well on contact with the bottom of the

oil pan would deflect this if it were mounted on rubber washers with teflon
screws?
