Marc Rotenberg had a compelling simile to counter Director Freeh's 
"airbag" statement on mandatory key recovery yesterday. Though some 
outlets saw the FBI position as a radical departure, this writer saw 
only more emphasis on themes from previous statements. This is from 
my story this AM.

"But Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Center, said 
the statement wasn't surprising. Indeed, documents obtained under the 
Freedom of Information Act and posted on the group's Web site for the 
past two years show that various parties within the White House have 
long favored mandatory controls. 'This is such old news that we had 
this on our Christmas cards two years ago,' Rotenberg said. 'We've 
known all along this was their goal. Louis Freeh says mandatory key 
escrow is like airbags? It's more like painting the windshield black. 
Happy driving, crypto users.'"

Denning had much to say against immediate imposition of mandatory 
controls, as well.
