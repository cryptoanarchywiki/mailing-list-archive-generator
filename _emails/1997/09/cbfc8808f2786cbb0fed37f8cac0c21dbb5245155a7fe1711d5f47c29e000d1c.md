Anyone who wishes to export strong encryption to Internet addresses 
to which it is prohibited to do so by U.S. law may send a copy to me
as a file attachment, along with the addresses to send it to in the
message body.
I will accept up to 100 addresses per crypto program received for
forwarding.

If for any reason you feel that the terrorists who are ruling your
country might be able to persecute you for exercising free speech,
I would be happy to forward PGP 5.0 upon receipt of only the email
addresses, with no instructions or requests.
