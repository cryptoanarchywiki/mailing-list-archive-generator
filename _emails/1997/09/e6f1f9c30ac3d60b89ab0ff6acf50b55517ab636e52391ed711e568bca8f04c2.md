Contrived? Did you read the post from News of the Weird about the
funeral home owners in Bankok(?) who were paying hospital employees
to murder patients who were known to them and likely to use their
services when they died? (Subject: Oxygen Escrow?)
Sadly, no matter what sicko, bizarre scenario you wish to 'contrive'
in order to illustrate a point, if your point is valid, then it is
likely that you can find a real-life example that runs parallel to it.
