If they are faking, it's a nice forgery.  But I doubt it.  AOLers are
usually this dumb, while for some odd reasons, some smart AOLers
exist.  Of course, consider they aren't too smart if they stick with
an Orwellian online service that treats it's customers like shit.

AOLers, Rennie, are kinda like newborns, they make a hell of a lot of
noise, but they don't know too much.
