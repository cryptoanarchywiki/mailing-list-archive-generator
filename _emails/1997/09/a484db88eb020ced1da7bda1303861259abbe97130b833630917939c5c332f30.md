Here's an application which is well suited for steganography.  This is
a random-character stereogram.  Look at it with a monospace font and
unfocus your eyes so the two blocks of text merge, and you will see
the message HI displayed:

This was just done manually, so it's pretty crude.  It would be easy
to write a program to display any message desired.  People could get
in the habit of sending long vertical stereograms saying "GO GIANTS"
or "MICROSOFT SUX" or whatever they felt like at the moment.  The
program could either generate its own random numbers or else suck
in random data from a disk file.

In this case, if you take the left block and reformat it so that it can
be base64 decoded, you will see a short message.  (Unix users can
pass the left block through "mimencode -u".)  In a real stego
application the message would be encrypted in 'stealth' form so it
was indistinguishable from random bits to anyone who did not hold
the decryption key.

This could even catch on as a legal "thumb your nose at the spooks" fad,
people adding random sterograms at the end of their messages.  You
could even have an active .sig which had a constant message but used
different random characters each time.  They wouldn't actually be sending
anything but there would be no way to be sure.

Some people say they'll just forbid transmitting data that looks random,
but realistically, that would be very unlikely to happen.
