This may go against your religious wishes, but listing your children
with SSNs of public figures may allow you to bypass the IRS computer
that checks if the child has a valid SSN listed, without getting SSNs
that 'belong to' your children.

| Hi.
| 
| We are in trouble with the IRS, and we need help.
| 
| For religious reasons (explained below), we do not have Social Security
| numbers for our children, the oldest of 4 being 5 years old.
| 
| Last year we sent in our return, as we have always done, without SSNs
| for our children. My wife and I do have social security numbers, and we
| sent those. IRS sent us a letter saying they were disallowing our
| exemptions since we had no SSNs for them. They gave us the opportunity
| to contest their disallowance, which we did by sending them our
| children's birth certificates; and letters from our parents, and a letter
| from our pediatrician, stating the children we claimed were indeed our
| children and our dependents. We don't have a problem proving that we are
| claiming legitimate dependents.
