Lucky, 

I think your observation below is an excellent illustration of why support 
or opposition to GAK must be a binary decision. Either you are for free 
speech, or you are not. There is no middle ground because middle ground 
will not satisfy a feral government. They will eventually demand full, 
immediate access to cleartext of all encrypted message, regardless of any 
public statements meant to appease opposition to incrementalist steps, 
because without it, they essentially have nothing. 

It is worth noting that when you look behind the curtain, you see a feral 
government that does not believe you have the right to private thoughts.
