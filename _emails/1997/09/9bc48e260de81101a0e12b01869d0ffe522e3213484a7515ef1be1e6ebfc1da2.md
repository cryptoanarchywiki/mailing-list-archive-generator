Seems it is in his best interest to not change it. Not only does he get
notoriety but he weakens your trademark claim by demonstrating that you
don't use it exclusively and that it has a history preceeding your claims.

Also, since he has been so kind to work with you have you recompensed him
for his loss at your gain?
