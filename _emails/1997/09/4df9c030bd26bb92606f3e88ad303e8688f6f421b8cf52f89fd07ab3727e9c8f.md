The reason is because...

The sjmn is crap. Thier valley coverage is terrible, and when it isn't it's 
coming off ap or reuters. They commonly commit factual errors and thier 
business editor is a joke.

My friends and I in the valley don't even call it by it's name,  it's 
become known as the "Fry's ad" (for those not in the valley, frys is a 
large consumer and computer electronics shop. But on steriods. And they 
advertise like crazy all over the sjmn).

Remember SJMN motto: If it's news, it ain't here.

 Subject: Why no coverage of CA resolution on Encryption?
 Cc: hua@chromatic.com

 Why was there no coverage of CA State resolution SJR-29?

 I find it using the search facility at:

     http://www.sen.ca.gov/www/leginfo/SearchText.html

 And the result is at:

 
    http://www.sen.ca.gov/htbin/ca-billpage/SJR/29/gopher_root2:[bill.cu  
rrent.sjr.from0000.sjr0029]

 The on-line magazine has a full article by Will Rodger on this:

     http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/daily/970908b.html

 Apparently there was some attempt by the Clinton Administration to
 cover up their lobbying effort.  I don't understand why the
 Administration would care about a California state RESOLUTION of all
 things.  Why does the Clinton Administration want to prevent a state
 legislature from speaking its mind?

 And what's with this attempt to claim "copyright" on that fax?

 Please get some answers on this!  The US Senate/House will be voting
 on important encryption legislation in the coming days.  The people of
 this country deserves to have a open, informed, serious discussion of
 one of the most important privacy issues of the information age.  We
 cannot afford to let a few intelligence and law enforcement agencies
 dictate policy TO us against our will.
