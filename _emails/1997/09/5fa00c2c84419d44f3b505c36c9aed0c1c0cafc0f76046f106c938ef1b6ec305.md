That's like asking, "If the feds get what they want, how many more churches
will they burn, and how many more families will they shoot in the woods?"

The answer is nobody knows.  But judging from from history it seems that
when they feds are allowed to do whatever they want, innocent people often
get killed.

A better question to ask is how many more people will die before we do
something about the corrupt federal agents.
