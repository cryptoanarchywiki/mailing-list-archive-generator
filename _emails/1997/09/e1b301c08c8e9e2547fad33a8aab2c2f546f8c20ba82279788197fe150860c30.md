Tim May is correct (as is Declan's clarification of his earlier note). 
If the amendment does become law, however, do not expect two things:

1.  Do not expect that it will be fast-tracked to the Supreme Court, as
was the case with CDA.  Instead, expect that it will start with the
District Court, take years to get to and through the Court of Appeals,
and then, if the U.S. Supreme Court decides to hear the matter at all
(it would have no obligation to do so), much more time there.

2.  Do not expect that a case will involve a broad coalition of
plaintiffs, as was the case with the CDA.  Expect that the courts will
only entertain an action by a plaintiff with traditional standing:  one
who goes through all of the bureaucratic hoops trying to get a license,
and then is turned down.

None of us know, of course, if the amendment will become law.  But if it
does, plan on it being a good while before the judicial process results
in anything determinative, one way or the other.
