A democracy which doesn't respect its limits of power is the problem. This
has always been the problem with all forms of governments and will continue
to be the problem with all forms of government (even anarchy). People are
people, people are strange; it isn't a question of technology [1] or time.
The solution is people taking more direct and immediate action in the first
person. Always has been, always will be.

Irrespective of all the spin-doctor protestrations to the contrary not
withstanding.

Governments are governed by the 3 laws of thermodynamics just like
everything else.

You can't get ahead
You can't break even
You can't quit the game

The failing with the founding fathers is that there were not enough
amendments in the Bill of Rights explicity listing citizen rights and
federal duties and limits in the first place. THAT is the problem with
our government today: even the harshest critics of their day trusted a
federal government too much.
