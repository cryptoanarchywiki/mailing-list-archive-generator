And, just (I am starting to sound like Tim :) as I predicted years ago, 
it passes with overwhelming majority. OK, to be honest, I predicted that a
domestic ban/severe restrictions on use of strong crypto would pass with 
well over 90% of the votes. And that prediction of course still stands.

If they can ban machine guns, they can ban crypto. Expect nothing from 
the Supreme Court.
