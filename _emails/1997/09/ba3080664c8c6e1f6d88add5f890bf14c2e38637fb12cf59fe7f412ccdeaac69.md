That's true.  And it is worth taking the trouble to distinguish
between pure subsidies like those that TRW and welfare queens take
from tax subsidies which most people take.

Still, a tax deduction is a benefit.  How much would you pay for a
$1000 tax deduction?  It depends on your marginal income tax rate, of
course, but presumably you would pay around $300.

Mr. Treibs is asking for this benefit, for special treatment from the
government, solely because he has children.  If he doesn't want the
government to insist that his children be tagged like everyone else,
it would be very easy for him to forego this benefit and pay under the
same tax scheme that many other childless people pay.

Unjust?  No more so than the tax rate people without children are
forced to pay.

But, I wish Mr. Treibs and his family well.  They sound like the kind
of good decent people that one would like to have for neighbors.
