Baloney.  The figures you give later indicate 1000 or 2000 investigations
a year meeting computer encryption.  Even if they were all unbreakable
that's 2000/year in a population of how many ?  Dents the clear-up rate
by how much ?   Makes me think the issue is the preservation of many
thousands of _unathorised_ taps.  What else could explain that viewpoint?

Over here video cameras in public places seem to hit the jackpot
quite often in this area.

Witnesses are better, they can catch the lone molester who has no 
communications.  We had a well-publicised case a couple of years ago
where a man was caught with a kidnapped girl in his van shortly after
a gardener happened to see the girl's feet beneath the van at the instant
she was lifted off the ground.

Incidentally, I'm against terrorism, child molestation etc etc. 
I'm confident most other cypherpunks are too, so no nonsense please
about free crypto supporters being backers of [crime of the month].

But he was convicted anyway ?  So crypto was not a problem to LE ?

Also not a problem if the files were found to concern the plot.

As above.

If life were that easy you'd have your budget cut, and deserve it.

Here in the UK you just have to say 'West Midlands Serious Crime Squad'
(now disbanded) to blow away the idea that the police evidence is always
genuine.  Even today a senior policeman is reported in newspapers as
saying his force employs dishonest people who would not be employed by a
supermarket, and that he regrets needing such a high standard of evidence
to fire them.  When you think how easily alleged communications can be
faked in contrast to physical evidence (such as a bloody glove, say)
I'm uncomfortable that electronic evidence is even admissible.

Very good points.
