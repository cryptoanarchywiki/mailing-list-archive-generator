this doesn't seem to help solve the problem very much.  The way SMTP works
right now, spammers can frequently just connect to somebodies SMTP server,
drop off a load of e-mail, and let their server handle it.  (identical to
how the ISPs customers drop off mail)

All we get out of this is a way to blame those who sign their mail and get
slammed by a spammer.

Funny, this wouldn't seem to hurt remailers all that much.  You'd
basically guarantee that, yes, the mail really did come from the anonymous
remailer.  :-)
