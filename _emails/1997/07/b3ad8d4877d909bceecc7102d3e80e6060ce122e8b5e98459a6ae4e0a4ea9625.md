 I saw this on another mailing list and was wondering if anyone has any
information as to what kind of security problems PGP had.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1


Due to security problems Pretty Good Privacy, Inc., will be using
a new signing key in our email correspondence, with an effective
date of July 1, 1997.

The new key can be downloaded from our keyserver at:
http://www.pgp.com

Any PGP Corporate key other than the following should be regarded
as having been revoked:
pub  1024/6C309BDF 1997/06/30 
Pretty Good Privacy, Inc. Corporate Key <pgp@pgp.com>

All employee keys with pgp.com addresses should also be regarded
as having been revoked unless signed with the new Corporate Key.
