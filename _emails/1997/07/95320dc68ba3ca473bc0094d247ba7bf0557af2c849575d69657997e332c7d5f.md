Four of the IRS messages on Jim Bell came here (see below), two via 
cypherpunks@toad.com and two directly. (Oddly, none were forwarded
from cyberpass.net as usual for messages to cypherpunks@toad.com.)

There are four messsage IDs, one of which matches that of Alan Olsen
(Number 2 below at 12:29).

These seem to indicate that the sender was using several lists of
addresses, held 18 hours for vetting by the Treasury mail beagles.

Perhaps others could check their message IDs, inquire around listdom 
in order to assemble a list of targeted lists. Then a stink might be
made for the spam, get that Denver judge to hit "IRS Inspection" for 
another $250,000 to pay recipients for IRS's lack of proper public 
humility, if not for Jim's undue imprisonment, isolation by federal defender, 
coercion of witnesses, distortion of literature, and railroading Jim Bell 
to warn outlaws to not fuck with Sam's Gang and Roy Bean.

Note: Jim's Roy Bean docket shows that USA v. Bell was assigned to
Judge Franklin D. Burgess on July 9, with new case number 97-CR-5270. 
The US Attorney filed "Felony Information" on that date. That's the 
final entry, no listing for the alleged plea bargain.
