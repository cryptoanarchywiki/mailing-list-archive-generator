>First, I think there are a number of problems inherent in any content
>filtering system, some of which you discuss in your column.
>
>Given that, I think the main problem with the Internet Content Coalition
>approach is how, and who, will determine what is a "real news
>organization" is and what "bona fide news sites" are.  Is this the job of
>the ICC?  You completely ignore this issue both in the column and on the
>ICC web site.  What are the criteria that categorize Cnet as a "news
>organization?  Would EPIC and the ACLU (cited in your column) also fall
>under that category?  What about listservs where news is disseminated?
>
>The U.S. Public Policy Office for the Association for Computing (USACM)
>web site http://www.acm.org/usacm disseminates news about computer policy
>related issues as well as USACM position pieces on those issues.  It also
>archives back- issues of the "ACM Washington Update", a bi-weekly
>electronic newsletter.  Is the USACM web site a "bona fide news sites"?
>
>I believe these are important questions which need to be addressed before
>Cnet endorses any content-filtering approach to censorship. "Privilege"
>needs to be defined before Cnet or any other group can seek "to make sure
>that only real news organizations claim this privilege."
