For the company explanation go to:
http://www.cnet.com/Community/Welcome/About/profile.html

Here's my explanation:

CNET doesn't compare itself to Microsoft, IBM, or MCI.  Do you categorize a
"significant industry player" based on its household name and revenue status?

CNET has a variety of services...we have 10 Web sites and 4 TV shows...each
one has a different goal.

CNET doesn't "speak" for the whole Net community.  That's not our goal.
Our goal is to _provide_ the Net community with various services whether it
be reviews, news, TV shows, or commentaries, all of which focus on
technology and the Net.  That might not be significant to you Phil, but it
is to the million+ who use our services.  

Netizens may not always agree with CNET's stories, reviews, or
commentaries...and we welcome opinions.  You know the saying: "Negative
feedback is better than no feedback."

Hope this answers your question.
