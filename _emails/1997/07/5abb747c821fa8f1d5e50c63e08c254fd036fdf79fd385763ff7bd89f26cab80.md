Actually - and you can forward this to relevant parties - woad, the
infamous herb used by the Celtic warrior in the form of blue body 
paint, when mixed with urine (which is how they applied it to their
bodies) causes a reaction very similar to cocaine and most amphetamines.
The reduction in pain that is felt from wounds and the ecstacy brought
on can easily be confused with a typical beserker reaction. The term
beserk originates from "bare sark" - the beserkers wore little if no
armor and the Celts are particularily famous for going into battle
"in the altogether" except for the blue war-paint. The feeling of
invulnerability that comes from the woad "high" led to this custom.

Other semi-legal although dangerous "highs" can result from the 
ingestion of too much nutmeg or jasmine, both hallucenogens.
