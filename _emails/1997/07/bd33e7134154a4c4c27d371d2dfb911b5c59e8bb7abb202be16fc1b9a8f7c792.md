And surely the only reason anyone would want to encrypt anything was if 
they had something to hide.

I regularly walk very close to shop fronts in the towns near me so I stay 
out of the field of vision of the CCTV cameras, arrest me now, I must be 
dangerous....

I think if enough people wore suitable hats it would make it more 
difficult for individuals to be identified on CCTV tapes.

Define law, and define social norms and why they should be adhered to. On 
second thoughts, don`t even bother, just think it over for yourself, I am 
uninterested in your perspective.
