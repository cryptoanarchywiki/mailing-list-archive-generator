I agree. Far better to have a law "so bad, so blatantly unconstitutional"
that it _must_ be struck down, thus giving freedom to encrypt as one wishes
the endorsement it needs.

The Beltway Bandits need to resist the temptation to "work the issues" and
help craft a compromise bill which is still bad but not nearly so blatantly
unconstitutional, as this might do some real mischief by delaying the
overturning for many years.

(And, in my opinion, the modern American system is filled with thousands of
examples of laws inconsistent with original Constitutional intent, but not
so blatantly clearcut that the Supremes would have to act. The "death of a
thousand cuts," or the "frog in boiling water," whatever metaphor one
prefers.)

Better that the "cyber rights" groups simply take an absolutist stance on
all of these issue, about cryptography, labelling, etc.

And no legislation is needed, as the Constitution is pretty clearcut on the
basic issues.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
