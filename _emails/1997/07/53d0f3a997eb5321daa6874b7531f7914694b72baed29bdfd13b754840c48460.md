     Thursday.
     
     The computer, in a home office on the second floor of thetownhouse,
     had four bullet holes in the hard drive and one in themonitor.
     
     One bullet struck a filing cabinet, while another made itthrough a
     wall and into a neighboring unit. No one was hurt.
     
     Police evacuated the complex, contacted the 43-year-old man
     bytelephone and got him to come out. He was taken to a hospital for
     amental evaluation.
