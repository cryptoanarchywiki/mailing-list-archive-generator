  The correct translation of "de minimus non curat lex" is: 
"No fart, no foul."
  In order for order to prevail, society must have the authority
to punish those who fart in a crowded theater. On the other hand,
if someone farts in a forest and nobody smells it...

  Never mind. I was having an AOL flashback.
