A heartwarming report.

The NSA represents the worst of America: its paranoia, its ruthlessness,
its end-justifies-the-means amorality.  The NSA's personnel policies
reveal its attitudes clearly.
(http://theory.stanford.edu/people/donald/NSA.doc.html)

It is ironic indeed that the NSA is being weakened, not by the foreign
enemies it sees behind every curtain, but by the EEOC.  NSA's immoral
and callous mistreatment of employees and its jealous defense of white
heterosexual male privilege have been shielded for far too long behind
the cloak of national security.  An organization which seeks the
darkness so eagerly can only fear the light.

There is no place any longer in the world for an agency like the NSA.
It is an enemy to freedom and an enemy to the free citizenry of its
own country.

We need a new agency, one to defend us against infowar, to help
industrial competitiveness, to assist Americans in retaining their
freedoms rather than attempting to strip them away for its own evil
purposes.  Let us hope that the changing of the guard at the NSA will
lead to a rebirth and a renewal as an agency looking forward, rather
than one concerned only with guarding its own rear.
