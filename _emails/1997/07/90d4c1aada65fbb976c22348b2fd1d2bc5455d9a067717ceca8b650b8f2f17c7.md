	Declan, what would you think if the actual keepers of the keys, 
so to speak, were the courts, such as the Administratoive Office of the 
US Courts?  That would at least seem to reduce a lot of the possible
privacy concerns.  One has the sense that once they get into the hands of 
the varius agencies, they'll get back out.

Best,
