British Queen Admits to Being a Keen Web Surfer

22-JUL-97

LONDON, ENGLAND, 1997 JUL 22 (Newsbytes) -- By Sylvia Dennis.
Buckingham Palace's press office has revealed that one of the reasons
for the opening of the Royal World Wide Web site at
http://www.royal.gov.uk in March of this year was Queen Elizabeth's
fondness of the Internet.

According to press reports in the serious UK press over the weekend,
both The Queen and her husband, HRH Prince Phillip, The Duke of
Edinburgh, are keen users of the Internet. The Queen is apparently
using Internet e-mail to keep in touch with favored UK citizens.

Rather than use the obvious e-mail address of
one@buckinghampalace.co.uk, however The Queen is apparently using a
number of pseudonyms to hide her true identity.  Only the recipients
of her e-mail are alleged to know who is really behind their messages.


-- 
He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of
officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
