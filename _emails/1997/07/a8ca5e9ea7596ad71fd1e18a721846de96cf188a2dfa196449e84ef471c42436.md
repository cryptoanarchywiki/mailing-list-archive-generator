If you want to diddle with GAK provisions to make them just a little
more palatable (honey to make the pill go down?), I prefer my old one
from 1993 (and 4 and 5 and 6 ...).

Have the key split 12 ways, by XOR, so you need all 12, all have to 
agree the desire is justified and all can do whatever they want
with the information that the key request came in and was or was
not satisfied (by them):

1)	ACLU
2)	NRA
3)	Republican Nat'l Committee
4)	Democratic Nat'l Committee
5)	N Y Times
6)	Washington Post
7)	Christian Coalition
8)	Libertarian Party
9)	FBI
10)	NSA
11)	Speaker of the House of Representatives
12)	U S Supreme Court

Deliver requests by US Postal Service.

Have each session key released individually
(by having the sender split the session key 12 ways and
encrypt each piece under the public key of a different
agency listed above).

All requests include the name of the target and the
reason for the suspicion.  Since all the above can be
trusted, there will be no compromise of law enforcement
objectives.
