 If You Build It, They Will Con 

  by Declan McCullagh 
        

     Perhaps the thinking behind DefCon went something like this: Lure
hundreds of hackers to Las Vegas in the middle of the summer, ply them with
cheap beer, talk about packet sniffing, and observe. Last year the result
was self-organizing chaos, capped by an event where the hired strippers
were upstaged by a band of exhibitionist conferencegoers. "The pimp was
like, 'Oh my God,'" says Dark Tangent, DefCon's organizer. 

     Last weekend's fifth annual DefCon may have been a little less
raucous, but it was no less important as a place where hackers from around
the world gather to socialize, gamble -- and glance around furtively trying
to spot the government agents who infiltrate the convention. (Bonus: If you
guess correctly, you can take a prized "I Spotted the Fed" T-shirt home
with you.) 

     Naturally, DefCon has always been populated with a slew of specialized
talks on "Hacking Novell Netware" and uses of "embedded microcontroller
applications." But this year, speakers such as Richard Thieme spoke of
finer points: For instance, how hackers should avoid merely imitating their
predecessors' exploits. Instead, they should learn the intricacies of
computer systems themselves. "This is really functioning as a call to
excellence," Thieme says. Then there was Carolyn Meinel, who maintains the
"Happy Hacker" mailing list. "You don't need to break the law to be a
hacker," she told me. 

     Maybe not, but the DefCon crowd -- mostly teenagers and
twentysomethings -- wasn't listening. Some tried to pass counterfeit $20
bills when registering. ("We'll beat your ass," Dark Tangent warned
afterward.) Others tried to snatch the DefCon banner from the convention
hall. By the time the conference began, the hotel's antiquated phone system
had been penetrated and instructions distributed on how to call long
distance for free. The hotel's radio frequencies quickly appeared on the
DefCon mailing list. On Friday evening, security guards booted two revelers
after a hallway skirmish led to blows. And someone was carrying around a
door to a GTE truck -- I never found out why. 

     All of which might explain Las Vegas's growing reluctance to host the
event. Dark Tangent says the convention has become virtually blackballed.
"You're dicked. There's no place to go," he says. This year, Dark Tangent
had to rename the convention "DC Communications" and take out $1 million in
liability insurance. He also moved the conference to the Aladdin, a
ramshackle hotel -- complete with faded purple carpets and cheesy lounge
singers -- that seems the only venue now willing to risk hosting DefCon. 

     Still, the Aladdin seemed a choice venue for Winn Schwartau, the
"InfoWar" crooner whom many hackers love to hate. He showed up to host two
rounds of Hacker Jeopardy. Teams of digerati took turns heckling Schwartau
and competing in categories such as National Security for $300: "A: The two
possible meanings of DOS. Q: What are Denial of Service or Disk Operating
System?" Or, "A: The assistant director of the FBI who handled the TWA
investigation and was behind the Clipper Chip. Q: Who is James Kallstrom?" 

     Bruce Schneier, author of "Applied Cryptography" (and the star of his
Hacker Jeopardy team), spoke on Saturday about "Why Cryptography Is Harder
Than It Looks." He warned of overconfidence when designing a cryptosystem:
"The math is perfect. The computers are bad. The networks hideous. The
people worse." Says Schneier, "We need to recognize the limits of the
possible." 

    Sameer Parekh, president of C2Net, spoke the next day about offshore
crypto-development: "We export jobs, not crypto." Jobs seemed to be what
many in the crowd were looking for. As one generation of hackers gives way
to another, a new batch of self-anointed "security consultants" appears on
the scene. Of course, there are never enough scouts in attendance to hire
them all. 

     Dejected, and unable to hack more than the hotel PBX, some found
solace in the seamier side of Las Vegas. I saw a note inviting everyone to
a "StripperCon" that was being held down the street at the Tropicana Hotel
on Saturday night. I went gambling instead. 

     Short $75, I wondered whether next year's DefCon would be worth
attending -- that is, if it happens at all. But surely there will be a
DefCon 6, and since Internet Underground has gone to pasture, who else will
there be to cover it? So I poured another shot, dialed 9# on the wall phone
and placed a long distance call to the editor. On the house.
