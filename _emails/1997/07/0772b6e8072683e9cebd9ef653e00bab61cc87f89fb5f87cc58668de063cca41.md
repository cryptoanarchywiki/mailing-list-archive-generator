It has no real effect. The problem is that corporations have very
good reason to expect governments to abuse key escrow. The
Nixon administration showed that the President of the US was
capable of ordering the burglary of his opponents offices. Since
the President appoints the Supreme court this is a pretty direct
demonstration that nobody can be trusted.

The concerns for foreign corporations are even greater. France
openly boasts about its commercial espionage. It also murders
its political opponents by planting bombs on civilian ships. Any
foreign corporation operating in that company must expect a
concerted effort to disclose its trade secrets to its French
competitors.

People in the security industry are paid to be paranoid, to reduce
risk to the lowest possible. If your security model does not trust the
CEO of the company concerned absolutely why should minor
officials of the US government be trusted?
