  We will be meeting under the Oak Tree that is inside the "U" shape
of Tresidder Union, the weather report looks good.  Bring your
Ricochet...
  Tresidder Union is a little (peninsula) west of the Stanford main
Quad, there is a parking lot just p-west of of the Union that you can
park in on weekends.  The best automotive access is from the west via
Junipero Serra Blvd. (also somtimes called Foothill Expressway, Santa
Cruz Ave & Alameda De Las Pulgus) into the 'back' of the Stanford
Campus, look it up on a map folks.  For some semi-useful maps try:
