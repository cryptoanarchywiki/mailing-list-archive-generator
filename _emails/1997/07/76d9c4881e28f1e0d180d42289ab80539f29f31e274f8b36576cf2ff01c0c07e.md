It's the way of all governments. First denounce something, then co-opt it,
then get rid of the competition.

But imagine how this might rebound to our favor: suppose NSA
Microelectronics, Inc. finds itself limited in its sales prospects by the
NSA policies limiting electronics companies...maybe NSA Microelectronics
will point out to the DIRNSA that the nice flow of kickbacks to all senior
NSA managers will come to a halt if NSA Microelectronics is not able to
sell its crypto products domestically.

Still, better just to have a trial and then hang them.
