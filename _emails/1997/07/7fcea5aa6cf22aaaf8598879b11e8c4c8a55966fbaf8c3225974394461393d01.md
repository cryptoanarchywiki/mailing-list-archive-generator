yikes - this response makes me as nervous as any misguided government GAK
program.

Yes, why *should* the poorest and most starved people in the world have any
more than they do? It's a free world, ain't it?  They're free to avail
themselves of the latest in technology, health care, and education to
improve their lot aren't they?  

No, they're victims of transnational corporate wealth-displacement programs
funded by the IMF and World Bank, organizations which fatten tinpot
dicators' personal fortunes while forcing an export economy onto the weak,
stripping them of the power of self-sufficiency in order to feed corporate
Masters with no place and no conscience.

These people the ones who pick your fruit and vegetables; they're the ones
who make your designer sneakers and the silk ties and nice button-down
shirts you wear to your cubicle every day.  They're the ones who have no
voice, no power and no chance. They starve in order to feed and clothe and
entertain you, that's why. 

There are equitable balances of wealth distribution, and there are
unconscionable and indefensible ones.  I try to play a part is maintaining
a balance saner than that of a world dominated by people with your
response; I deliver boxes and bags of things I no longer need to Goodwill
and others; I wrote off as much as I could in charity donations last year;
my wife sponsors a child thru the Christian Childrens Fund; I try to
educate myself -- to learn why the peasants revolted in Chiapas, how GATT
and SNAFU -- oops I mean NAFTA -- really work and whom they really benefit.
 I write when I can to try to pass along some of what I learn.  

Do you continue giving when someone else has less than you do?  Absolutely.
I hope that you will eventually grow up and achieve some wisdom and
compassion.
