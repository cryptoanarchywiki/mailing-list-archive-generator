  Yeah, Lucky Green took care of it.
  We should have a few hours to discuss what we're going to do
to that piece of shit, WG III.

  I've got the bodies of the children on ice. Steve Schear has the 
superglue and Dimitri has the nails. Peter Neumann just placed an
anonymous call to the FBI, so we're ready to fix that rat bastard.
  Let's take this discussion off-line in case WG III manages to
get his email back on-line.

Gee, Man!
