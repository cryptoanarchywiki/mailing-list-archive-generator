  Citizen-Unit May is coming dangerously close to thought-crime in this
message. The politically correct phrasing is as follows: 

  "Since convicted felons lose their rights to vote and to have guns, surely 
there is no reason why they shouldn't also lose their rights to free speech 
and religious freedom. We must protect the children from such dangers."

  This issue provides clear support for our long tradition of compromising
with the government on important issues - had we taken a "no compromise"
stand on felon's rights to vote and own guns then we would not now be able
to use that as justification for restricting further rights, just as prior
compromise on the First Amendment rights of "child pornographers" has given 
the government a neccesary stepping-stone for restricting freedom of speech 
of adult pornographers and other authorized enemies.
