In what way is this a compromise?  This is just the standard LEA
position.  Oh, I see.  Those who disagree with this position are the
ones expected to "compromise".

There's no room for compromise anyway.  They want access to our keys,
we don't want them to have access.  Either they succeed or we do.
There's no middle ground.
