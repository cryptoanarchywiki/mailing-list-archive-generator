Phil what can I say except this is just BULL!

Last time I looked the S/MIME & X509 v3 specs were not in a finished
state.

What I have seen of the specs I do not like. The sepcs are overly complex
and fail to offer any added security over what can be obtained using PGP.

Then we have GAK directly referenced and supported in the specs:

>5.1 Binding Names and Keys

>An S/MIME agent or some related administrative utility or function MUST
>be capable of generating a certification request given a user's public

>or by a "key recovery" service).
 
Now lets add to this Netscapes support of weak crypto & their
implementation of "policy tokens".

Are these really the people you wish to trust with the future of crypto??
Are you willing to condem the world to Win95 & Communicator (2 of the
bigest peices of crap I have ever seen passed of as comercial software).

Phil Zimmerman has done more for putting STRONG crypto on every desktop
than M$,N$,R$A or the rest ever have or ever will.

Make no mistakes about it, our goal should be to put STRONG crypto on
every desktop not just any weak peice of crap available. Weak crypto is
worse than no crypto at all.
