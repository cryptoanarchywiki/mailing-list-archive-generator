Well I see some problems with this. Any increase in bandwith requires the
addition of hardware to accomplish it. It would be of little use to me to
have 100 Mb/sec for 3days considering the cost of installing the lines and
purchacing the extra equipment.

Also in a packet switching environment how do you plan on insuring any
amount of bandwith? The Backbone is not set-up for this. The only way in
the current enviorment that you can guarantee a given bandwith is by
having a dedicated connection point to point.
