In this week's Festival Issue of the award-winning 
Shift Control (http://www.shiftcontrol.com)...

Reg Presley, lead singer with Sixties legends the Troggs, 
provides a sound argument for today's festivals; we 
supply full listings for 30 summer events throughout 
Britain and Europe; and this week's interactive quiz 
asks: how wild are you about festivals?

Plus...

"Take your own food. Some people see a festival as 
an opportunity to lose a couple of stone, and judging 
by most of the food sold at them it's not difficult to 
see why. Just because it's organic doesn't mean it's 
edible, man. Take your own bread and Pringles. A baguette 
is also a good idea, as you can wave it in the air during 
an Orbital gig." 
- Nick Green on what to take and what not to take to a 
summer festival.

"While Richard Krajicek and friends took early showers, 
mud baths were the order of the day at Glastonbury. It 
seems that those at Glastonbury enjoyed a weekend of filthy, 
sweaty, fun, while at Wimbledon it was all code violations 
and double faults. If we are really to admire our sporting 
heroes, isn't it about time they had some more balls in the rain?" 
- Roland Rocks rants about British tennis's lack of sporting 
courage.

"We ate felafel, chick-pea curry and something with yellow 
peas poured from a bucket, then decided to head backstage. 
There we bumped into too many people we know who proceeded go 
on about their hotel rooms, showers and marble-lined bathroom 
suites with pre-heated loo paper. We decide it was time to 
either leave or kill them." 
- Simon Waldman on the great Glasto wash-out.
