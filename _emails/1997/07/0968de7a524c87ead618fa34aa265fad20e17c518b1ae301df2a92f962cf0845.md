Funny thing is that Sympatico.ca is NOT some fly-by-night ISP, but one of
the larger ISPs and has the deepest pockets. Sympatico is run by
the Stentor group, which is the Alliance of the provincal 'Bell' companies
in Canada. 

Each province buys the basic 'francise' from MediaLink (??) in Upper
Canada, and resells it and packages it how they want. 

I use Sympatico in New Brunswick (nb.sympatico.ca) which is a repackaging
of their NBNet service, but the admin is not the same as SaskTel
(sk.sympatico.ca) or Bell Canada (Ontario symaptico.ca). 

The problem is with is spam is not they do more of it, they are most
likely underqualified to fix the problem of non-Sympatico users using the
various Sympatico SMTP servers are a relay.
