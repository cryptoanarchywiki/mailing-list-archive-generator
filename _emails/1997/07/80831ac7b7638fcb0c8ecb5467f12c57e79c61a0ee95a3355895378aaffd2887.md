Photons are the vector boson for em radiation, in a wire or in the air.
In the wire the photons go from electron and protons to other electrons and
protons. This is what makes them want to 'move'. Despite popular vision, they
don't go bumping into each other like a bunch of ping-pong balls in a pipe...

As an aside, this is actualy where the heat comes from not friction. Some of
the photons that are emitted are low frequency and not re-absorbed.

(having taught electronics for several years I  have grown to realy hate the
 hydraulic model)

Yes.
