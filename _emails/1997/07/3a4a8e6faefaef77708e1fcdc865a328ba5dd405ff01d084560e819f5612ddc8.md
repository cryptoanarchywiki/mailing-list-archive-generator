Hm.  I have already sent out e-mails to on-line merchants 
asking if I can order a Newton, because I've heard from several
people that Newton has a superior user interface, and I know 
that its CPU is super fast.


Unfortunately there is not yet any PGP or Ecash for Newton 
publically available.


How about for Pilot?


Is there gcc or any other C compiler for Pilot?  (There is not,
yet, for Newton a publically available C compiler AFAIK.)


What _are_ the cool things Ian Goldberg can do with a Pilot, 
anyway?


Regards,

nobody in particular

Disclaimers follow:  I am not a crook.  NOT speaking for DigiCash
