remember those purple neon "chaser" lights that people used to put around
thier plates to to make them harder to read and bounce lidar off of... dont
see them much anymore they probably went the way of blackout windows they
both make it harder for police to apprehend the dangerous criminals. In
fact if you get pulled over with blackout windows in NYC you might be
greeted by one of new yorks finest pointing a gun at you instead of the
ususal solem "liscense and registration please". I think that if the
government could make a case that mandatory brain removal would stop crime
most people would be all for it.
