Please forgive me for following up to my own posting, but I just realized
how close I was to a solution:

A Constitutional amendment that would call for the impeachment of the
President for failing to veto any three bills that are overturned by the
Supreme Court on Constitutional grounds.

Call it "The Failure to Do Your Job" amendment, or the "For Violating Your
Oath" amendment.  Maybe include a clause that stipulates the ex-President
must also return any salary earned during his or her tenure.
