Furthermore, if you have no smut on you page, but you link to offensive
content (rated or unrated) somewhere else, how does that rate?

A while back on a whim, I created a page that is based on a type of ambush
humor.  The link describes something in a way where you think you are going
to one thing, but go to something entirely different.  If they push
something where you have to label everything for the most clueless out
there, it will ruin the whole page.  (I find the idea that I might get
prosecuted for my Goth page absurd, but it is possible considering the
clueless morons in power.)  The page (outdated links and all) is at
http://www.ctrl-alt-del.com/~alan/goth.html .

Something else...  Why does the press refer to Gore in such terms that make
him look like he is some sort of techno-nerd?  The man is totally without
clues.  (I believe the proper term is "Connection to Clue-server refused by
host.")  The "Information Superhighway" that he was pushing was a souped-up
cable system for Ghod's sake!  (The extra bandwidth was going to be used by
starting movies every 10-15 minutes instead of having to wait.)  The
hearings on that were high clueless theatre...  Maybe Declan can due an
article on how far removed Gore really is from the process.  (But that
might offend his corporate masters...)
