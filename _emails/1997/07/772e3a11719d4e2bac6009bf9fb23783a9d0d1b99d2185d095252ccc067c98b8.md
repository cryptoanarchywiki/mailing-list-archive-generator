Hi,

I have obtained a Sparc ELC (4/25) w/ 24M of RAM and 200M of disk space
under Solaris 1.1.2 (SunOS 4.1.4). I will be installing the gcc suite from
the O'Reilly "Programming with GNU software" since this is a supported
OS. I intend to set it up as a small public access irc server. I was
wondering if anyone had suggestions on such hardware and what to use.

The crypto relevance is that I was thinking of having a #cdr channel which
would receive traffic from the regular mailing list. In other words when a
user joins #cdr they could use the normal irc functions but a bot would be
receiving the mailing list traffic as it arrives and sending it out. I am
not proposing to send the #cdr traffic to the mailing list. It would be
one way only. Though a bot function to forward mail on a per request basis
might be implimented if some suitable abuse avoidance mechanism could be
worked out.

Any other crypto relevant suggestions on this topic welcome.
