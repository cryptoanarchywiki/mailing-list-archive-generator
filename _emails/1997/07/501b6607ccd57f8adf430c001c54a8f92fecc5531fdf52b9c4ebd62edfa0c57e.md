PROGRAM OVERVIEW

 The encryption debate has revolved around issues of industrial
 competitiveness, personal privacy, and the interests of national
 security and law enforcement.  This briefing seeks to bring two more
 issues into the policy discussion: scientific freedom to conduct and
 express cryptographic research, and human rights applications of
 cryptographic technologies.
