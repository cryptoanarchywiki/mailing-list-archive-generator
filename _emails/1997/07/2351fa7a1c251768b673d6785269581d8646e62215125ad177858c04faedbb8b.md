Put your own personal, business, or corporate attorney on retainer for only $70.  

Why pay $200.00 to $500.00 per hour for legal work?  Our staff of experienced 
attorneys are at your service.  Among the services provided are:

*  Legal writing and lawyer letters
*  Drafting and reviewing contracts and briefs
*  Research, advice, and opinions
*  Tax law
*  Real Estate
*  Negotiations and arbitrations
*  Accidents
*  Leases
*  Wills and trusts

You never have to leave the comfort of your home or office.  All work 
is done by phone, fax, or email.  You pay a monthly fee of only $70.  
The first hour each month is FREE and you pay only expenses plus 
$50 for each additional hour regardless of the type of work.

UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE - If you are not satisfied you will not 
be charged.  It's as simple as that.  

Note:  To protect your privacy, our name, address, and phone, fax and 
private email numbers will only be divulged to our clients. 

Don't get stuck paying one third of a cash settlement or a huge fee to an 
attorney for a few hours work.  Don't sign a contract, buy a house, settle a 
dispute, or make a major decision until you review it with your own personal 
attorney.  Don't let the company that's jerking you around get away without 
a lawyer letter.  Become our client now and have legal representation available 
at your finger tips.

To become our client, simply pay the $70 retainer fee for the first month.  Upon 
receipt of your retainer, we will send our contract of representation immediately.

hour is $50 per hour plus expenses.   $70 per month will automatically 
be charged to your credit card or checking account.  You may cancel 
your contract at any time without penalty.  If you are not satisfied with 
our work, your hourly payment will be refunded.  You will receive a
