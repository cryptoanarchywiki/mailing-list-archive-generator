Hopefully this is a harbinger of things to come (a July 7 press 
release at http://www.pgp.com), and maybe Phil can out-Gates Gates 
and assimilate Micro$oft (hey! I can dream, can't I?):

The Allegro Group, Inc. has incorporated PGP technology in their 
Encryption Gateway for Groupwise. Now, the 8.5 million users of 
Novell GroupWise will be able to send and receive encrypted email and 
attachments securely and easily. The Encryption Gateway for GroupWise 
is available on the Windows NT platform and is available as a beta 
product today. 

<snip>

The gateway is a 32-bit application and does not require any 
additional encryption. It supports keys up to 2048 bits and 
attachments (including uuEncode and MIME). The gateway works with any 
PGP or ViaCrypt product and/or key pair, and administrators may 
customize help and error messages. 

<snip>

Now if they can keep this up and get their foot in the door with all 
the other email vendors.
