Probably a very bad plan unless you like prison food...

Like the downside if you get caught is likely to be non-trivial.
Imagine an outcry above the Mitinic level and bellow the McVeigh
level...

On the other hand I would not be too sure about the level of security
being exceptional. I know that the NSA was not involved in giving
security advice on Federal Web server setup until very recently (after
the CIA raid).

I suspect that the result of Lucky's mail is thart some poor guy is now
going to have to sit up nursing a comms link watching for attempts to
penetrate. Mentioning possible security holes in specific installations
in public is not really fair. I know of one well known security
consultant who claimed to have reported a security weakness at a
particular site. Caused a massive panic. When the alledged report could
not be found you can guess what happened to the guys chances of getting
any business...
