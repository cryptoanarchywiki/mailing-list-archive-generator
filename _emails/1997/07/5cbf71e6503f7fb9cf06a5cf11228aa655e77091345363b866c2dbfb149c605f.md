Well I don't know about anyone else but the more information that comes
out on this the worse & worse it looks.

Between this & the Netscape/Microsoft/Verisign Sellout I would say that
things are looking much worse that if the CDA had been left intact.

I think that several of us need to get together with the authors of Lynx
and produce a GNU secure webbrowser and take on these SOB's.

I don't think that it would be all that much work to mimick NetScapes
plugin interface so the same plugins will work with the GNU browser.

The "Net" will not be safe as long as N$ is allowed to do whatever they
please.
