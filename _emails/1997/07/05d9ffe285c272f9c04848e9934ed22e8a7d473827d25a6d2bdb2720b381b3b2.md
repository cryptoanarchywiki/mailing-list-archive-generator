	I can only speak from experience that PGP 5.0 is "good software"

in that it has not caused me any problems.  In the DSS/Diffie-Hellman

vs. RSA debate, you would do well to go to www.rsa.com and read their
FAQ
on both cryptosystems.  5.0 is different from 2.6.3i in the following
ways: 5.0 can create DSS/Diffie-Hellman key pairs, 2.6.3i cannot. 
2.6.3i
can create RSA key pairs, 5.0 cannot.  5.0 can utilize both kinds of key

pairs whereas 2.6.3i can only utilize RSA key pairs.  As well, 5.0 is

legal to use in the US while 2.6.3i violates copyright protection. Only

you can decide which is better for your purpose(s), however.

	2.6.3i is completly compatible with 5.0 (and vice versa)

_except_ if it involves DSS/Diffie-Hellman key pairs.

	As I recall, domestic use is being threatened by a law that would

make illegal the use of cryptosystems without escrowed keys.  At present

time though, it is legal to send enciphered messages to and from the US.



> 4. How strong is strong?



	From Applied Cryptography (Second Edtion) by Bruce Schneier (which

you should buy a copy of) ...


	"The wise cryptographer is ultra-conservative when choosing
public- key key lengths.  To determine how long a key you need requires
you to look at both the intended security and lifetime of the key, and
the
current state-of-the-art of factoring.  Today, you need a 1024-bit
number
to get the level of security you got from a 512-bit number in the early
1980s.  If you want your keys to remain secure for 20 years, 1024 bits
is
likely too short."

	Of course it is!  One of the uses of crytography is to secure

those messages that would otherwise be monitored in plaintext.  It goes

without saying that the ciphertext can be monitored, as well.
