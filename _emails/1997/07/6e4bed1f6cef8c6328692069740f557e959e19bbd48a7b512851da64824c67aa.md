At one level, it is not.  Punishment intrinsically involves
restriction on rights.  Your right to free speech *is* restricted
while you are in jail.  Your right to practice your religion can be
infringed -- you may not be able to have a prayer blanket, for
example.  When you are convicted of a felony you step into a different
category as far as protection of rights are concerned.

On another level, they are *different* rights.  So, in practice, the 
rights to free speech and free religion are given greater weight.

It's really more of an issue of practice, rather than principle.  
There is no disputing that once you are caught up in the criminal 
justice system your rights are constrained.  The constitution 
guarantees the accused certain rights, to be sure, and the convicted 
rather less.  But it is clear that the blanket provisions of the Bill 
of Rights simply don't apply to criminals.

However, the issue is very complex.  "The system" has a number of
discretionary points -- variable sentencing regiems, time off for good
behaviour, probation, parole -- all involve different levels of
constraints on rights, all constitutional. 

In principle, once you accept that the state has the mandate to 
punish criminals, you accept that criminals lose rights.  Period.

As an anarchist you may say that the state has no such mandate.  But 
then you have the messy problem of what to do with common criminals, 
and you end up with a state that you refuse to call a state.
