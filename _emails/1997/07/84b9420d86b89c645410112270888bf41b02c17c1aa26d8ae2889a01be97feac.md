I would like to see your proof that a healthy democracy requires compromise.
This is truly the pot calling the kettle black in regards to mis-understanding
the fundamental dynamics of 'healthy' democracies.

Declan, you are truly an idiot if  you believe that you can obtain any sort
of democracy, let along a healthy one, by giving up fundamental liberties.

With friends like you we don't need enemies, we don't have to worry about
them taking anything you are more than willing to give it away.
