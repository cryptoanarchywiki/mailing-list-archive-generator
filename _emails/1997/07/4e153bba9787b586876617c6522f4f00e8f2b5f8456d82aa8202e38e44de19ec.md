There's a GCC development environment for the Pilot that
runs under Linux.   Also packages for synching, logging in from
the Pilot to unix, perl tools, assemblers, disassemblers, and
about 400 other things.

Check out http://www.inforamp.net/~adam/pilot/ for info.

It's pretty cool how much stuff is available for the pilot.  It's
too bad that I need either a full workstation with all the trimmings, or
just a pen and a (paper) notebook.

SSL, telnet, ssh, xcopilot, a POP mail client and some more stuff.
