I meant that taxes are essentially uncollectable for interstate
transactions like mail order purchases.

I buy several thousand dollars worth of stuff each year by mail order, and
only a few hundred bucks worth of it has been taxable.

My state, California thinks I should either send them a check for 8.25% of
all that I have purchased, or that the vendors in New Hampshire, Ohio, etc.
should send them such a check....we all ignore this notion, and there is
little to be done. It is this sort of "tax arbitrage" I was drawing a very
real parallel to.

Most "tax the Net" talk I hear about is about taxing Net commerce (as
opposed to, say, placing a per minute tariff on Net connections). Hence, my
point.

I wasn't referring to either corporate or personal income taxes, which have
little or nothing to do with the Net.
