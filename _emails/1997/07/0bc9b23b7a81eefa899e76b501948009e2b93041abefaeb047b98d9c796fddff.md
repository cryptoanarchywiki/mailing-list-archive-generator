Feh.  Either it was real, or it was forged.  In either case, 
the sender could have gotten names and addresses for the usual suspects
by watching the cypherpunks list; no need to crack Jim's machine.

It _was_ nicely forged, if it was forged.  One amusing method
that could have been used for the forgery is the method used
by Kashpureff for the alternic.net / internic.net rediriection -
when a site sends a DNS request to your name server (e.g. because
you've sent some email through it to you), send back some additional
records with the sites you're impersonating - especially if the
subdomain at irs.gov didn't really exist.  You can reinforce it by
adding the IP addresses you choose to your in-addr.arpa reverse DNS.

Clearly not - there are major ECPA and invasion of privacy issues.
But there's no evidence that they did that.
