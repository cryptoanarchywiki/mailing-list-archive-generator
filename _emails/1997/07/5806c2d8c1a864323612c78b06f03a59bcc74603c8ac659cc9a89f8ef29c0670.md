Peter Gutmann sez:
[..]
: What makes this case especially awkward is the fact that the CDROM can't 
: legally be sold outside the US, which means the only way the rest of the world 
: can get it is through illegal copies.  Given the immense usefulness of 
: something like this, I'd say it's only a matter of time before bootleg copies 
: start appearing outside the US, but because of the USG's position we can't pay 
: for it even if we want to (DDJ wouldn't look too good if they accepted payment 
: for what they knew was illegally exported crypto).  Perhaps a donation of the 
: same amount to charity would serve as some equivalent to payment...

It would be nice to see a Dr. Dobbs CD at the HIP ...
