Hello Petri and others,

I think you haven't fallen off the tracks. We have now (very soon) SSH 1.1
clients. Instead of SSH 1.1 we call the product SSH Tunnel&Terminal. This
way we want to emphasize that SSH is a very nice tool for remote and mobile
workers.

Most of the details about SSH 1.1 you can find in the press release.

Regards,
Tom

SSH 1.1 - Easy to use product for remote/mobile workers. It can do all the
same that SSH 1.0 does and it is more optimised for telecommuting.

Probably we should update SSH 1.0 sheets.

Should be in a couple of weeks.

You still need some knowledge to make the initial configuration. After that
it is very easy. I don't know about the automatic deployment tool.

MS PPTP does not provide strong crypto. With the SSH tunnels we are almost
directly competing against PPTP. Of course PPTP is not available for win3.x
and Mac. I'm preparing some info about PPTP, at least for our partners. The
problem is I'm not sure what to say and how.

This is very interesting. I have to admit I don't know what this really
means. Let's find out on Monday.

This seems to be an error. We are doing the Mac also. Sorry.
