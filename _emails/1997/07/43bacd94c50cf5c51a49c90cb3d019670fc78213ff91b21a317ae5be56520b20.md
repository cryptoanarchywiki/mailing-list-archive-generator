The Cryptography-Politics-PGP-L ListServ is in operation.(We just 
finished up with the majordomo scripts and the like). Here is what you 
need to do to join.  BTW, this list is a digested list. Please do not 
freak if things do not go right straight from the get go. I hope to have 
this as painless as possible, yet we all know that Murphy wrote Murphy's 
Law just for this instance. Please bear with me. Once again, ANY 
suggestions, short of flames, will be listened to 100%!
Now for the nitty gritty.
