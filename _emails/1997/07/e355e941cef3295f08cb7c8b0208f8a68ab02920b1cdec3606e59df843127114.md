  Let me see if I get this straight...
  National security is important enough to strip the citizens of their
rights and freedoms and trample the constitution into the mud, but 
National Security is not so important that it can't be compromised for 
the purpose of removing competent white males from their jobs and
replacing them with less experienced and/or incompetent colored people
and women.

  Of course, when DEA agents are murdered because of incompetent
affirmative
action promotees at NSA, the government will call for stronger controls
on
encryption and greater powers of surveillance of the citizens.

  While the government blackmails its own citizens with legislation
which
threatens to imprison them for actions matching those of NSA employees.

  Is the White House declaring this a victory for minorities, drug
dealers
and child pornographers? Politics makes for strange bedfellows.
