	This is sort of entertaining considering that Verisign still
doesn't use strong encryption for themselves.  (Set your browser to
not use broken algorithms, and try to connect to www.verisign.com.
Makes me want to send them the data for a class 3 cert.)

	I'll save Sameer the trouble, and suggest that people buy
Stronghold.
