Not so, I believe Kent pointed out the US statute that describes 
unreasonable punishment as being "cruel and unusual", banning ownership 
of firearms as part of the punishment for a violent crime seems perfectly 
reasonable to me, but foo on that anyway: punishment should fit the 
crime, if you commit murder or rape or any one of a number of such 
serious crimes I see no reason why you shouldn`t be punished cruelly.

I can see the point of view which accepts serving of sentence as being 
the end of punishment, and I do not accept a ban on firearms as being 
implicit in the commision of a felony, but if a court explicitly states 
that part of the punishment should be a X year or lifetime ban I can 
accept that.
