Paul Pomes is a fouil-mouthed liar.  Please see his Net.Scum page at
http://www.netscum.net/pomesp0.html.

Two questions to Tim Skirvin:
1. Why was Paul Pomes fired from UIUC academic computer facility?
2. Does Paul still weigh 400 lbs?

That's a very good point.  Paul is an enemy of the cypherpunk anonymous
remailers. He complains about them to the remailer operators' upstreams
and employers.  Paul has been sending me obscene and harrassing e-mail
and complains to PSI, my upstream, about the contents of the e-mail he
thinks originated here.  Paul is a poster child for net.censorship.

Paul publicly claims to killfile anyone he doesn't like, but then goes
out of his way to silence them.
