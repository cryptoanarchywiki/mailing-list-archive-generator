            GOP: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD 'SHOCK' FOUNDING FATHERS
                                       
     July 5, 1997

     WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government is just too big, taking
     on things "that would have shocked" the nation's founding fathers,
     New York Congressman Gerald Solomon said Saturday in the Republican
     weekly radio address.
     
     "The Founding Fathers designed a government with limited and defined
     powers," Solomon said. "But that idea has been turned on its head."
     
     Chief among the government offenses, the congressman said, is an
     exorbitant tax bill.
     
     "What the founding fathers could not even comprehend is the idea of
     Americans paying more in takes than they do for food and shelter,"
     Solomon said.
     
     "Our Republican philosophy is different," he said. "We'd rather
     shrink the welfare class and put the American dream of financial
     security and independence within the reach of as many middle class
     people as possible."
     
     The recently passed budget, Solomon said, will accomplish that by
     offering tax relief to families with children, and those with
     "oppressive capital gains taxes."
     
     "We're not talking millionaires here," he said. "We're talking about
     people like grandparents who owned a house for years, reared their
     children in that house and then decades later they want to sell it
     when it becomes too much of burden."
     
     The GOP Tax Relief Act, Solomon said, "will help 2 million older
     Americans."
     
     Other aspects of the tax relief plan will help small business owners
     -- who may want to pass on the family business to sons and daughters
     -- by increasing an exemption on estate taxes.
     
     Solomon compared the current Republican tax cut to the birth of the
     United States 221 years ago.
     
     "Yes, on July 4, 1776, we won the battle of independence from
     oppressive taxation and today ... the Republican Congress has just
     won another battle to restore a larger chunk of that freedom from
     taxation to you," he said.  rule
