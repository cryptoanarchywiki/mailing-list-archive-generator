This rumor floats through alt.survival and misc.survival about once every
few weeks. Usually someone claims they "heard" this, but no one can produce
a cite for an actual law.

(Eventually someone steps forward and mentions the various Economic
Emergency Powers Act provisions, and this feeds the rumors further...in a
few weeks, when someone else announces they've "heard" this.)

The Mormons and other religious groups are well known to stockpile large
amounts of food. I recall that good Mormons are supposed to have on the
order of  a year's supply of food.

The effect on militia activities is nil, and even a law which made felons
of most Mormons and prepared folks would have no effect on militias.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
