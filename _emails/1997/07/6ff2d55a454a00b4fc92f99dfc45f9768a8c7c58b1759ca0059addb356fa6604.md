  I have to agree with the rat-bastard, cocksucking, motherfucking
sack of shit, Tim May, on this one.
  Having Tourette Syndrome, I object to anal retentives who would
criminalize my God-given verbal predelictions. Neither would my
receiving an exception on the grounds of being disabled be remotely
acceptable to me, since I sincerely believe that my TS is a "gift"
that allows me to say anything that others say to a judge, *plus*
being able to call him or her a Nazi ratfucker. (Anyone who thinks
this is a "disability" is fucking crazy.)

  On the other hand, it would be kind of neat to launch a class action
lawsuit demanding that ratings systems incorporate a label such as:
"Suitable (FUCK!) for children (COCKSUCKER!) with Tourette Syndrome"
