By the way, I don't recall it being mentioned that the message from "IRS
Inspection" had an interesting subject line: DEATH TO TYRANTS.

I don't know if this was on the message others received, but it was on my
version. Included below are the headers.

Odd that this would be used, and probably not coincidental that the famous
quote has been in my most recent .sig for only a few months, and only
_after_ the Bell arrest (as far as I can recall). It's unlikely the IRS
"Inspectors" had any mail from me via Bell's computer(s) with this quote in
it.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
