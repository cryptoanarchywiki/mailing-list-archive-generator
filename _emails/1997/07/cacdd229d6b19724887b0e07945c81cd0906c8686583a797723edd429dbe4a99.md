Well, as a thought, I'm on BugTraq as well, and it periodically forces you
to renew your subscription to the list.  If everything required this (or
some sort of it) you could simply charge a large amount for the renewals,
based on expected cost over the next time period.  Your initial
subscription would be costed based upon the average of all the
subscribers.  

This might be the simplest way, though charging a bunch for a specific
message could be complicated..
