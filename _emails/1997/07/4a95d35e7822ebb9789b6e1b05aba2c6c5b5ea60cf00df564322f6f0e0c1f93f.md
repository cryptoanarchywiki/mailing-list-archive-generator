  What follows is an example of the CyberBums predicted by one of the
list members some time back. This A(ssh)OL(e) is using his spambot to
"Spare change?" millions of people at a time and it turns out that
besides his required, basic tale of woe, that he also has the proverbial

  Don't send him any money.
  Send *ME* money. I will use it to buy enough cheap wine to enable me
to throw up on my shoes.
(Wouldn't you rather send your hard-earened money to an honest drunk
than to a lying bum?)
