This is a cop-out attitude. They should have screamed bloody murder and
demanded at least a public apology. Every commercial customer should
understand their right to sue for losses related to 'work in progress' and
for such seizures to be legal must be explicity listed on the search
warrant. Simply buying service from a company isn't worth the hassle to push
as probable cause, especialy if wrong even in one instance.

Hell, if they make less than a million a year each now it is in their best
interest to fight. The income potential alone is worth it assuming they had
the moxy to figure out a good way to market it. Which might be a novel
tactic to use, "screw with me and I'll make money off it, screw with me more
and I'll make even more..."

If the NSA can take our federaly mandated tax dollars to run a commercial
enterprise in the market they set legislation for why should anyone object
to others making a profit off their actions?

We need an amendment something akin to the 1st relating to the relationship
between government and commercial enterprise.
