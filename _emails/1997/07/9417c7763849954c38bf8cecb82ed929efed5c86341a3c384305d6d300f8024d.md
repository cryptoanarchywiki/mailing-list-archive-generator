Hi all,

I saw the address for this list in Jeff Licquia's PGP FAQ.  I haven't
subscribed to it heard, as the FAQ said traffic on this list could be 30-40
messages a day.  As I'm attempting to cut down the time I spend on
CompuServe...

Unfortunately, that means if you want to get a message to me, you'll have
to send it to me directly, you can't send it to the list.  My address is
atu5713@compuserve.com

My public key is included in this message.

Anyway, here comes my real question.  I am interested in finding an
easy-to-use no-nonsense anonymous remailer.  But anon.penet.fi seems to
have shut down.  I sent mail to ping@anon.penet.fi and help@anon.penet.fi
and I got a undeliverable message.  Could someone point me to a remailer?

Sincerely,

Alan Tu
