    I'm not labeling www.cptech.org, but of course, why would I want to?
However, there are lots of people who want to signal the adult nature of
thier web site, of course, judging from the "don't go here if you are't
21" type messages they put on them.  A good, simple adult tagging system
would help these guys do what they apparently already want to do, which
is to signal that the sites are inappropriate for children.  +
