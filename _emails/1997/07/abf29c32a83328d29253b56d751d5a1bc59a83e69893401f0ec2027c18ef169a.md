To use their own Yuppie expression, "will it 'walk the walk' down the gang
plank"?

The only thing the Administration can do is to do _nothing_. Gibberish
about the freedom of the Net while other departments speak of key escrow
and content control is a meaningless gesture.

Taxes are already essentially uncollectable, even in interstate
transactions, so the moves by Summers and Magaziner are truly token
gestures.

Their continuing support for GAK and content control are what has earned
them only our vicious enmity.

Oh, yeah, this minor issue of their demanding access to diaries, phone
calls, e-mail, and other computer-mediated communications without so much
as a search warrant.

They all deserve to be hung for treason, or dispatched the old-fashoned way
(a la Guy Fawkes).

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
