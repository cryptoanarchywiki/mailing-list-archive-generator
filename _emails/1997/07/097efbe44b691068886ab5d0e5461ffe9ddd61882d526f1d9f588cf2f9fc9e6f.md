Yes, Dimitri.  Freedom is also the freedom to act "stupid".  Since
"acting stupid" is a subjective evaluation it implies that one is
allowed to make subjective, individual decisions.   This is as
opposed to having a central authority decide what is and isn't 
stupid -- telling us how to lead more efficient, carefully planned
lives.

Freedom is not necessarily efficient, but it beats the hell out of
whatever comes next.

himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? Or have
we found angels in the form of kings to govern him? Let history answer
this question." --Thomas Jefferson: 1st Inaugural, 1801.
