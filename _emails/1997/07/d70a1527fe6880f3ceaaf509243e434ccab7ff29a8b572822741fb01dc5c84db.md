II.  Tip o' the Day

Tired of Downloading Lots of Files you don't want with WebWhacker?
WebWhacker 3 only downloads what you want!
 
If you are tired of using precious disk space up with useless files 
downloaded by WebWhacker, then you need WebWhacker 3's Content 
Filters!  With these filters you can choose not to download any files 
with certain file extensions, files that are too large, or secific 
MIME types.  For example you could choose to only download .WAV files 
and not .AU if you had Windows 95 and not a Macintosh, and only if the 
files were less than 100KB in size.  There is no end to the filter 
combinations you can use!

To use the Content Filters, click the Content Filters... button on the 
second step of the URL Subscription Wizard or view the Filters Tab of 
a URL's Properties.
  
If you don't have WebWhacker 3 then buy it now!
