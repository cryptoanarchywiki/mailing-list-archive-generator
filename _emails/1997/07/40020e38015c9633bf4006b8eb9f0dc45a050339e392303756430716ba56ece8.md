Fixed fee versus unit pricing for information goods:
competition, equilibria, and price wars
by Peter Fishburn, Andrew M. Odlyzko, and Ryan C. Siders

Information goods have negligible marginal costs, and
this will create possibilities for novel distribution and pricing
methods.

The main concern of this paper is with pricing of
goods that are likely to be consumed in large quantities by individuals.
For example, will software continue to be sold at a fixed price for
each  unit, or will it be paid for on the basis of usage? There is
substantial evidence both from observing marketplace evolution and from
surveys that customers overwhelmingly prefer subscription pricing. It
turns out that even if we ignore this factor, per-use pricing is not a
clear winner, and therefore when the preference effect is taken into
account, subscription pricing is likely to dominate.

We model competitive pricing between two companies that supply
essentially equivalent services (such as movies or  word processing
software). One company charges a fixed fee per unit,  while the other
charges on a per-use basis. Each is interested in  maximizing its
revenue. We consider instances of the models that have  stable
competitive equilibria between suppliers along with  situations that are
unstable and, in the absence of collusion, lead to ruinous price wars.

Efficient Pricing in Data Transmission Networks: The
Argentine  experience
by Mauricio Drelichman

This paper develops a model to reflect the Argentine  market for
end-user  Internet access and draws conclusions on certain  aspects of
economic  efficiency. After the Introduction, the second  section,
entitled A  Simple Model, provides a descriptive analysis of the  market
and its  related industry, deriving a stylized technology and
setting up a basic  model. The third part of the paper, An Application
to  the Argentine  Market, applies the model to Argentina, while the
fourth section,  Lessons from a Linear Demand Case, examines the
results of the model  under certain conditions. The model and the
linear  demand case are fully  developed in the Appendix.

What's the Right Economics for Cyberspace?
by Michael H. Goldhaber
Which economic theory best describes what goes on on  the Internet? If
you believe as I do that the explosive growth of the  net and its
relatives will likely continue until they become the  dominant arenas
for
human effort and involvement, this is no idle  question. Theories are
guides to action: sticking to the wrong one can lead  to ruin; adopting
the right one opens the path to success.

Digital Money, Liquidity, and Monetary Policy
by Aleksander Berentsen
The term digital money refers to various proposed  electronic payment
mechanisms designed for use by consumers to make retail payments.
Digital money products have the potential to replace central bank
currency, thereby affecting the money supply. This paper studies the
effect of replacing central bank currency on the  narrowly defined stock
of money under various assumptions regarding  regulatory policies and
monetary operations of central banks and the reaction
of the banking  system.

WebMonitor: a Tool for Measuring World-Wide Web Server
Performance
by Jussara M. Almeida, Virgilio Almeida, and David J. Yates
Server performance has become a crucial issue for  improving the
overall  performance of the World-Wide Web. This paper  describes
WebMonitor, a  tool for evaluating and understanding server
performance, and presents  new results for realistic workloads.

WebMonitor measures activity and resource consumption,  both within the
kernel and in HTTP processes running in user space.  WebMonitor is
implemented using an efficient combination of sampling  and
event-driven  techniques that exhibit low overhead.

Our initial  implementation is for  the Apache World-Wide Web server
running on the Linux  operating system.  We demonstrate the utility of
WebMonitor by measuring  and understanding  the performance of a
Pentium-based PC acting as a  dedicated WWW server.  Our workloads use
file size distributions with a heavy  tail. This  captures the fact that
Web servers must concurrently  handle some  requests for large audio and
video files, and a large  number of requests
for small documents, containing text or images.

Our results show that in a Web server saturated by client requests, up
to 90% of the time spent handling HTTP requests is spent in the  kernel.
These results emphasize the important role of  operating system
implementation in determining Web server performance.
It also suggests  the need for new operating system implementations
that  are designed to  perform well when running on Web servers.

E-Journals, Archives and Knowledge Networks: A
Commentary on Archie  Zariski's Defense of Electronic Law Journals
by Bernard Hibbitts
In his First Monday article "Never Ending, Still  Beginning: A Defense
of  Electronic Law Journals from the Perspective of the  E-Law
Experience",  Professor Archie Zariski asserted that, despite recent
musings to the contrary, electronic legal periodicals have a bright
future in the age of the Internet. This article challenges that
contention, arguing that  in law as in other disciplines, the reach,
dynamism
and interactivity of  the Internet offer opportunities for the
development  of new scholarly  publishing paradigms - in particular,
archives and  "knowledge networks"  - which have the potential to enrich
and envigorate  legal learning more  than even the most progressive
electronic legal  journals.
