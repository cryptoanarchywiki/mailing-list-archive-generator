Since I seem to have been misunderstood on at least two lists now, let me
forward this. --Declan

Lizard has it right. My post was meant to be satire.

I should have been more clear. In fact, a good friend of mine sent me this
message: 

> Declan, remember how I promised you I'd let you know as soon as I

>
> This is the red flag. Get out.

Apologies to all.

In the future I will label all satiric posts as -L18, meaning those who
are under 18 will probably not get the joke. By labeling my posts in this
manner, I can ensure that they will be indexed up by search engines that
will in the future only index properly-labeled pages. I can also ensure
that users of Internet Explorer will remain able to read my scribbings,
since the next version of IE is going to ship with RSACi turned on as a
default. 

I will thus do my part to ensure a childsafe cyberspace, free from
inappropriate material and bad jokes of all kinds.
