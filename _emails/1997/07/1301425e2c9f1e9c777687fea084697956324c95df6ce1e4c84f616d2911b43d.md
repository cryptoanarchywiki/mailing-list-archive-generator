  Since the government was incapable of protecting either the people
at Waco or those at OKC, then who exactly are they protecting?

  We consider them Branch Davadians.

  This was before Dan Rather and Kookie Roberts became "the ultimate
authority." Since they have to compete with Bart Simpson for ratings,
their primary interest is in making sure that the citizens don't "have
a cow" during their broadcast.
  {"Today, all rights and freedoms of the citizens were suspended by
Executive Order. And, in the lighter side of the news..." <cut to
"cute puppy" story>}

  Adolph Hitler obviously understood what Noah Webster was writing
about.
If we could get the writings made into a TV movie (or a cartoon), there
might be a minute chance to get the American public to understand, as
well.

  Is it still legal to say this stuff? Perhaps we need a new law that...
