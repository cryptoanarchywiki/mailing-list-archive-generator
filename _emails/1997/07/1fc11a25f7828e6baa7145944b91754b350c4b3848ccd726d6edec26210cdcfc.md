Hi folks. I'm on a Japanese National Police Agency study group board working
on proposals for Key Recovery policy in Japan. The only documents that
are currently being reviewed are rather official OECD type documents
from the US and I am trying to find other opinions (technical, legal,
political) which I can add to the reports/documents being reviewed by
the panel.

Any pointers or opinions would be greatly appreciated. My deadline for
submitting materials is 7/11 and I will be giving my verbal opinions
on 7/28.

Thanks in advance.

 - Joi

P.S. I am also working with politicians, the Ministry of Posts and Telecom,
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and several other
ministries as well in similar policy areas. So even after 7/11, please
point me at anything (or point anything at me) that you would like the
Japanese policy makers to consider. Lots of stuff is currently being
reviewed in Japan in this area in the wake of the stuff going on the
US.
