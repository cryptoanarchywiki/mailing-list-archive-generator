Do you have any information about the ESPN/SportZone web site store being 
hacked?  Or a contact?  The pro-crypto folks on the Hill are quite 
interested to know if 1) this site was using encryption before being hacked 
and 2) what type of encryption they are using now (one of the press stories 
noted that crypto was one of the security measures implemented after the 
hacking).

I realize this was probably an inside job, but it's good fodder for the 
Hill.  Any insight you might have -- or other examples -- would be great.

Thanks in advance.
