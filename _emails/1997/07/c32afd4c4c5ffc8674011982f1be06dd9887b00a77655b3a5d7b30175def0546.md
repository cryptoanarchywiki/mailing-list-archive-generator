On Tue, 29 Jul 1997, a spamming weasel shit named A Hoier spammed us with:

For the stupid, this is an email address grabbing technique.  If you reply
to this, or do as is said, this weasel will have many many email addresses
to send spam to.  IMHO this is a rather stupid weasel as there are easier
ways to do this, but a weasel none the less.
