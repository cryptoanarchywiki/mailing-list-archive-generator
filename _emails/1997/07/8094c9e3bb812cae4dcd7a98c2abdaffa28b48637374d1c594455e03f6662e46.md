The full text of this very frightening amendment is now available on CDT's
Web site at:
	http://www.cdt.org/crypto/legis_105/SAFE/index.shtml#970725

It's a chilling glimpse at the Administration's view of a
mandatory-domestic-key-recovery world. This is the first time I've seen
anyone put such a provision through the House Legislative Counsel process.
