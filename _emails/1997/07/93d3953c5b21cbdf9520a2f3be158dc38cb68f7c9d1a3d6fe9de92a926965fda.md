Defence counsel: Your honour the FBI agent could have cracked my 
clients grocery list within 24 hours if he hadn't taken a long lunch 
break at Hooters Topless Bar & Grill and not overlooked that he was 
running his NifTY War3Z crAk3R v0.3 against the wrong file.

Prosecutor: Could not

Defence: Could so

Prosecutor: Irrelevant your auspiciousness, the fact is the grocery 
list was not decrypted in 24 hours.

Judge: I sentence the defendant to $100 000 penalty or in default 15 
years at a federal re-education facility.

Defence: But your worthiness it was only a $35 grocery list!

Judge: Anyone seen my gavel?
