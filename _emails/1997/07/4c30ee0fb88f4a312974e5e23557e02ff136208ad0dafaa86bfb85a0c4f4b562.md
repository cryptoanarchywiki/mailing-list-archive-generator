Internet makes resistance futile, Clinton aide warns

This byline appeared in The Financial Post of July 24, 1997 at the top of the
front page.

The subsequent article discussed not crypto, but Canadian attempts to regulate
television content. Even so, the second paragraph is succinct, and applicable to
both debates. 

"Ira Magaziner, Clinton's international emissary on the issue of how governments
should respond to the explosive growth of business on the Net, said any attempt
to regulate its content would not only be a mistake, it would be futile."

Perhaps someone should get Mr. Magaziner back to Washington to explain this to
the administration.

Great minds think alike, fools seldom differ.
