Well, obviously I'm well acquainted with this particular theory....

However, pulling it off is the hard part. A few data points:

- my income derives solely at this point from investments. No better
example of a "geodesic economy" exists...my assets and sources of income
can be located anywhere on Earth, and can be sent there with a few phone
calls. And, yet, I continue to pay the IRS, the Franchise Tax Board, and
various regional satrapies truly obscene amounts of taxes.

(Why? Because sending my assets to Foobaria and then attempting to live
tax-free off the income/dividends/sales is not currently feasible. Note to
the advocates of this strategy: not even the advocates of using offshore
banks think this is workable as a tax avoidance scheme.)

- I rather suspect that all of the employees of C2Net, surely a
"Cypherpunks company" if ever there were one, mundanely receive their W-2s
and file diligently. (Actually, the odds are that some of them are already
delinquent on filing, but the point remains valid.)

- John Walker, the founder of Autodesk (Autocad), became a citizen of
Belize and now lives in Switzerland. As above, a "virtual entity." And yet
he tells me his taxes are higher than if he'd remained in the U.S. (he left
for complicated reasons, involving taxes, but not necessarily to reduce his
personal taxes).

So, I admire the theory. In fact, I wrote many essays on related points.
(Cf. "crypto anarchy") But it's not at all easy to pull it off.

Maybe in 10 years.
