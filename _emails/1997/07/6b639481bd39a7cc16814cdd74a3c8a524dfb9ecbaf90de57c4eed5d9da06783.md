For those who haven't heard, Analytical Graphics, Inc. is releasing version
4.0 of their Satellite Tool Kit (STK) program, absolutely free. Their web
site says they've decided it's the best way to introduce engineers to its
power; the way I heard it, they lost a lawsuit claiming it was developed
with government money and hence _can't_ legally sell it. At any rate, the
add-on modules still cost large quantities of filthy lucre, but the basic
program is quite impressive for anybody wanting to model satellite orbits,
sensor and communicator field-of-view, etc., etc. Check it out at www.stk.com.
