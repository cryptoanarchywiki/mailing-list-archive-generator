This again shows the importance of _technological_ solutions to privacy and
secrecy concerns over _custom_ or _law_ solutions.

And we can expect this example of Nazi accounts for gold stolen from Jews
and others to be used in the propaganda campaign against untraceable money
and secure banking. "Digital cash would make restitution impossible for the
Jews!" Of course, had the Jews had secure, untraceable assets in the 1930s,
instead of lots of gold coins and jewelry to store their wealth, Hitler
would have had a lot harder time seizing the assets. Details, details.

(Not to mention the seizure of American gold by Reichsfuhrer Roosevelt in
1933.)

Fact is, governments around the world want control of the assets of their
subjects, for taxation, for seizure, and for general control. Anything that
allows citizen units to have assets unreachable by the thugs in power is a
danger to them.
