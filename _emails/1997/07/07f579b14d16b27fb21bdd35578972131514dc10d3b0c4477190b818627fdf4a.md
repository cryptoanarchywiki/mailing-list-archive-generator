Well, we could use some help with the Revolution.    We need a crack team
of precision go-getters who will lead the way towards the new
anarcho-capitalist utopia, overcoming all the obvious & sundry obstacles in
the way, particularly over by D.C. way.

Or, how about another way to have an alternative internet which develops
the way it originally grew and became so popular, before commercial
organizations and spamming gold-diggers noticed it and got this idea that
they could syphon advantages from it if only they could just control it,
shaping it in their image, turning it in their direction.

That would do it, for me.
