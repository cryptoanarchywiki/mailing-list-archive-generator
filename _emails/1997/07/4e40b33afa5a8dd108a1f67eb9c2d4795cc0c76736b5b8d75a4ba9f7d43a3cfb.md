I think that is what the Kurt is arguing for.  Some sort of subject
tagging rather then a Adult content flagging.  This would have a dule
roll, it would discrouge peaple who do not wish to view that type of
matiral and would encourage peaple that do wish to view that matrial.

In addtion peaple would volterly rate there pagers without need to any
mandotry scheam as it would help peaple searching for that type of
matiral.


Please excuse my spelling as I suffer from agraphia see the url in my header. 
Never trust a country with more peaple then sheep.  ex-net.scum and proud
