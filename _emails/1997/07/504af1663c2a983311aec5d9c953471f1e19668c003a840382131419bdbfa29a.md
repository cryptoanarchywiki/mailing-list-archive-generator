Dear Susan:

I hadn't realized that you were still on f-c, but since you've popped up
a few times today, I thought that I'd use this environmentally friendly
way of speaking with you.

I was quite intrigued when I got an envelope from Microsys a few days
ago.  And I was honored that you consider me to be a colleague -- you
remember how you addressed the letter -- Dear Colleague.

I am, of course, quite concerned about productivity in the workplace. 
Why, everyone on f-c who knows me will vouch for the fact that I never
do anything which is not completely work-related during the business
day.  So while I have to confess that I was intrigued by the offer of
your corporate product, there's just one small problem: using it would
go against every moral and ethical bone in my body.

Granted, most attorneys may not have many of 'dem bones, so if I change
my mind, I'll keep your email address on file.  In the meantime,
however, you can save some postage costs and even a tree branch or two
if you delete me from your junk snail mail list.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.


Very truly yours,


-James S. Tyre
