Quite true, but the other main problem, that of major routers dropping
lots of packets during high traffic times (basically, anytime from noon
eastern until about 8 eastern is horrible, and it tends to pick up a
little after that I think, but it stays bad until after about midnight
eastern from what I've been able to tell), remains completely unresolved.
Some initiatives are in the planning stages to deal with these things, but
the sheer number of routes on the net at this point is a problem.  Of
course, MCI's horrible ATM <-> IP interface is a major point of congestion
at this point, at least from my connection here at school.
