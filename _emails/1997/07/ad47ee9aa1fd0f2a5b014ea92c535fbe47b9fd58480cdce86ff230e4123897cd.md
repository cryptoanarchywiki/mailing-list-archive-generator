 C2Net Software's Stronghold Web Server Adds nCipher Hardware Encryption
 Support

     OAKLAND, Calif., July 14 /PRNewswire/ -- C2Net Software today announc ed
 its Stronghold(TM) secure web server now supports the nFast hardware
 cryptographic accelerator from nCipher Corporation Ltd. "Like Stronghold,  the
 nFast accelerator is manufactured outside of the U.S., enabling us to off er
 our world-wide customers a simple, platform-independent way to speed up s
ecure
 web server throughput," said C2Net Software president Sameer Parekh. "Man y
 will find that Stronghold's terrific out-of-the-box performance is more t han
 enough for their needs. If not, adding one or more nFast units is a fast,
 simple way to increase encryption performance as required."
     "nCipher's nFast cryptographic accelerators enhance e-commerce and on line
 transactions by speeding up the processing of crypto keys," said Alex van
 Someren, president of nCipher. "Using nFast together with the Stronghold  web
 server gives customers throughout the world a quickly-scalable environmen
t for
 conducting secure business on the Internet."
     nCipher's nFast cryptographic accelerator interfaces via a standard S CSI2
 interface, making it compatible with virtually any computer platform, and
 mounts within the space of a standard 3.5-inch disk drive bay. Each nFast
 accelerator can carry out approximately three hundred 1024-bit public key
 signings per second.
     The Stronghold Web Server is an enhanced, secure, commercial version  of
 the popular Apache server. Based on figures in a Netcraft survey
  (http://www.netcraft.com/survey/), Stronghold is the second most popular
 commercial server for UNIX and the second most popular for secure applica
tions
 on the Internet.
      nCipher Corporation Ltd. (http://www.ncipher.com/), an affiliate of  the
 Newbridge Network Corporation (NYSE: NN), is a privately-owned developer  of
 cryptographic technologies for securing server transactions, including bo th
 software and hardware cryptographic acceleration products. nCipher
 headquarters are located in Cambridge, England, with US offices in Andove
r, MA
 and in Santa Clara, CA.
