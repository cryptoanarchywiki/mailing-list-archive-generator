  The government doesn't expect it, either.
  As a matter of fact, they are probably sitting back laughing their
asses off over your eloquent statements of logic which any rational
person could reproduce if they weren't programmed to feed unthinkingly
off of government media sound bytes.

  All of your points are well-taken and they will make no more 
difference than similar ones have made in the past. You will speak
your mind politely while the government goes about usurping the few
remaining privacies and freedoms we have.
  In the meantime, the nation is keeping busy bemoaning the fact 
that not everyone is going to be so polite in their protest of
the government assault on the liberty and freedom of the citizens.
The nation is busy venting their rage on a government mandated
monster, as always, instead of admitting that there is a much
greater monster in our midst which is slaying more of our citizens
in a variety of ways than McVeigh could ever dream of.
