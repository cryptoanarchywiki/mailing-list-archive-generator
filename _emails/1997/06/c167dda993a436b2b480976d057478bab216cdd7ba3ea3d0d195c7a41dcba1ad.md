Hello,

I was told that CBS or some other station air'd a story on Sweden.
"Sweden" ( not sure who? ) stated that they had knowledge of how to enter
ANY system that was conected to the internet.  Firewalls, etc... were
useless.  Has anyone else seen /or know this and is this true? or
complete mis-information?
