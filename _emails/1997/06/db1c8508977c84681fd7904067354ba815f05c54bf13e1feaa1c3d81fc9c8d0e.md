There are a few shortcuts you could take.  For instance, instead of finding
two random, prime numbers for every key, just keep one prime constant and
generate another random prime for each key.  This has the disadvantage
that any one key factored would allow the other keys to be factored
trivially.  I know there are other ways, but I'm not very good with number
theory.

Using this technique, it would take about half as long to generate 10,000
public keys.

The basis of PGP is the web of trust.  Keys are signed by people who are
trusted to be competent and truthful, so the user can be sure to a certain
degree that the key really is owned by the person listed in the ID field.
There are problems that arise with this simplistic key management system,
but I won't reiterate what has been discussed many times before.  There
are a few papers that discuss this in detail.  Here are some pointers:

ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-spki-cert-req-00.txt
                                draft-ietf-spki-cert-structure-01.txt
research.att.com/dist/mab/policymaker.ps
http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/

So the simple answer to this question is that one would not be able to
get all 10,000 keys signed, so there would only be one key that could
be trusted to belong to that person.
