Thanks, I`ll simplify all my answers into words of 2 syllables or less 
for you in future.

My point exactly, the IRA are criminal scum, as I have said. Of course 
they serve a purpose, but that really isn`t the point.

Thuggery in this vein is certainly not appropriate. I would have no 
problem whatsoever with the IRA if they concentrated entirely on killing 
poloticians, recall that not so many years ago they were less inclined to 
killing civilians (around the Brighton bomb and Airey Neave incident time).
Of course, the IRA have always been censorous thugs, they just happen to 
have taken also to killing innocent people in highly populated areas as well.
IMO, the IRA are terrorists, *not* freedom fighters.
