Give it a rest. The people inside had already murdered several BATF
agents. They had every opportunity to release the children and allow
them to get to safety. They had every opportunity to surrender.

Since you clearly intend from your earlier posts for "whatever follows"
to mean McVeighs murder of 167 people in Oaklahoma clearly it does not.

The US police may be incompetent and corrupt but that does not excuse
the Oaklahoma bombing nor does it in any way lessen the responsibility of
McVeigh and those who encouraged him.

If you have a duly authorised warrant from a court, the inhabitants have
shot at people from inside the building and you give them two months to
surrender, sure go for it.

Only I think that the SAS is probably better experienced.

yeah peacefull types whose response to a visit from the police was to
lie in ambush and shoot at them with automatic weapons.

So are you suggesting that the police ignore the complaints of illegal
ownership of firearms and child abuse?


And in any case the point is that Waco does not absolve McVeigh and
the militias for the blame for Oaklahoma.
