Development has not stoped on PI. As a matter of fact I just received an
announcement that a new release is out. I am currently working on a
simmilar project for the OS/2 platform. I am not sure what is being done
on the Mac or *nix.

Currently I am testing remailer support using PGP encryption but should
have mixmaster support as soon as I get the mixmaster code ported over. I
just downloaded the new mixmaster code so I will have to se what changes
have been made.
