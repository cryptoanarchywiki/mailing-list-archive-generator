Really.  It appears that the DESCHALL frivolities actually
enhanced the reputation of DES, fluffy press releases by C2 and
Security Dynamics notwithstanding.

This is a problem which I have been pondering in recent days. How
would someone in the future demonstrate that they have broken
DES, now that the RSA DES Challenge is behind us, and trusted
parties offering to generate and keep secret ciphertext/plaintext
pairs are no where to be found.

It would seem to me that the best way to demonstrate that one has
broken a block cipher without releasing ones algorithm would be
to generate and publish some key collisions, in which a
ciphertext/plaintext pair is mapped by more than one key.

If one encrypts plaintext with a known key to generate
ciphertext, cryptanalysis of the resulting ciphertext/plaintext
pair for a key other than the one used to generate it should be
comparable in difficulty to cryptanalysis of a
ciphertext/plaintext pair provided by a trusted third party.

The ability to generate such collisions at will clearly
demonstrates that one can calculate keys from
ciphertext/plaintext pairs.

A step in the right direction.  We should develop ways of
demonstrating cryptanalysis which do not require one person to
solve a problem provided by another person without the
possibility of collusion.

I like this.  It is somewhat cleaner than the key collision trick
suggested above.

Let me know when the money reaches $10k.

If there were to be no solutions at all, given the alleged
pseudorandomness of DES, this would probably be an even more
interesting result than solving the problem posed.
