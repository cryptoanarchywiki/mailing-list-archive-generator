I suggest really strong turkish cigarettes.  Smoke them constantly and 
soon
you will be hacking before you know it.

Depends on the age of tobacco purchace in your state.  You might have to
get into High School before trying the above method.

That is what they all say...

===================================================================

Hacking is something that you learn on your own. While there are a few 
folks that will show you the ropes, you have to learn on your own. 
Knowledge is precious, and even more so when you gain it through your 
own bllod sweat and tears.  I hope you really mean hacking, and NOT 
cracking. There are many of us in the hacking community that are ticked 
off because the media and the government have lumped us hackers in with 
the Crackers. Crackers are folks that enter systems for no other reason 
that malicous damage of systems and vital infromation. These folks are 
usually punk kids out to romp around Cyberspace doing damage for kicks. 
There are professional crackers but are usually hired by governments and 
major corporations for either "NAtional Security" reasons or plain old 
Corporate espianage. Hackers on the other hand, are folks that believe 
in the free exchange and flow of information, and yearn for knowledge. 
While they occationally do break into systems, it is usually only for 
the challenge of doing so and NOT with the intent of causing damage. 
Most hackers that enter systems, will usually clean up after themselves 
after merely looking around the system for awhile just to see what is 
there with no intent to cause harm, only making modifications to logs 
and passwd files to clear traces of their entry. They NEVER damage files 
intentionally and that is a MAJOR no no with most folks in the real 
hacking community. Some hackers even go so far as to tell they System 
Administrators of the systems they enter that they did so, and how they 
did it so the Admins may plug the holes.  Unfortunately, the government 
and the media have placed us within the same catagories as the 
Darksiders. I, for one, do hope you are a hacker and not trying to 
become a cracker.
