Yup.

Let me add one more I just posted to the cryptography list.

When you have non-GAK strong crypto for criminals to use, they (like the 
rest of us) will be seduced into believing that they have privacy and will 
loosen their tongues.  As a result, more and better intelligence will be 
available over that communications channel.  For the proportion of cases 
where the person on the other side is an agent or someone turned by threat 
of prosecution, this intelligence falls into the hands of law enforcement.  
Even better, this person who is reporting to LE is remote from the real 
criminal(s), so he is in substantially less danger of being frisked to 
discover a wire.
