Good point. Perhaps CNNfn and PC Rag insiders did just that. Maybe
even got a few for CaboComm's account. Maybe the insiders at NSCP 
dumped a few after the negotiations tanked. Screaming "terrorism" for
smoke.

Isn't it conventional wisdom that  the market is churned with with blackmail, 
greenmail, "terrorist" slaughter of W&O and such, laying down "free market"
smoke.

Story from Federal pen here is that the WTC bomb aimed to topple the pile 
onto World Financial Center across the road where the plushest players 
squat on gold but job-lock TLAs running the op said no-no, just terrify the 
fats into upping our CT-consulting fees and budgets, like IRA @ London City.

Inmate Ian was heard to warn, "Worked like a charm, din it: now shut your hole 
Youseff about that salted laptop fabbed up St Andrews, Great Malvern."
