Hi Jim,

Lets drop the analogies for a moment. :)

Now if I understand you (and feel free to correct me) this is what you
wish to do:

I as Joe Sixpack want to goto http://www.bigtits.com

You as goodie-2-shoes want to picket this site.

Inorder to do this you wish to have me goto http://www.NOW.com and see
their anti-porn page before I can see the bigtits page. (wether I actually
goto their website or the page is automatically downloaded is irrelevant
for the disscusion).

Now as Joe Sixpack I do not want to see the anit-porn page from the NOW I
want to see the bigtits page at www.bigtits.com

Where exactly is it in the constution that say that your free speech
rights extend to the point where you can force me to read what you have to
say when I don't want to?

I just don't see how you can make this leap regardless of who is doing the
funding.

BigTits have their 1st Amendment rights to free speech the same as the
NOW. BigTits puts up their web site & NOW puts up theirs. I now can make
my choice of who's speech I wish to listen to. If I decide to listen to
BigTits that is my right to do so and if I want to listen to NOW that is
also my right.

I'll leave the numerous analogies alone for a latter post. I just don't
see where anyone has the right to tell me what I must read.
