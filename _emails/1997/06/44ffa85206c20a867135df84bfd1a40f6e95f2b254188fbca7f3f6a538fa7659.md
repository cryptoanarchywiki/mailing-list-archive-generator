This little gem is extremely scarey, most specifically Title II Sec 207 
and Title III Sec 307 most of all!!  I have been on the phone with 
Congressman Jack Quin of NY, Senator D'Almato of NY, my local Common 
Counselman, and the U.S Attorny's Office (They will be the ones tasked 
with prosecuting offenders under this Bill.). It seems that not one of 
them knows anything about it. And they are currently IN Washington!!!
I was even told by Congressman Quin's Office that no such bills as the 
ProCODE, ProCODE II, or the McCain/ Kerrey Bills have been presented to 
Congress! Talk about your basic denial! I have provided a copy of the 
original HTML version of the SPNA as proposed by McCain and Kerrey. This 
was pulled directly from Senator Kerrey's website.
