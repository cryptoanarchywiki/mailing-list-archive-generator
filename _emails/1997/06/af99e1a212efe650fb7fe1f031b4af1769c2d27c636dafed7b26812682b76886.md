Johan Helsingius (Julf) has been ordered to release the identity of the
poster of one of the Scamizdat series of confidential materials. 

"The Court of Appeals of Helsinki (Helsingin hovioikeus) has upheld the
decision of the local court of Helsinki, in which Johan 'Julf' Helsingius
was ordered to reveal the user id of the person who used the anon.penet.fi
server to repost parts of Scamizdat, a collection of secret Scientology
scriptures. 

"In its decision dated 4th of June 1997, the Court of Appeals orders
Helsingius to reveal the names in 30 days after the decision becomes
final. If he doesn't try to appeal the decision it will mean that he has
to reveal the user id within three months. He might appeal the decision to
the Supreme Court within 60 days, in which case the whole thing will take
longer, regardless of whether the Supreme Court chooses to consider the
case or not. 

"The following ID's were used to send material through anon.penet.fi: 
an498608@anon.penet.fi, an545430@anon.penet.fi

"The material was a repost of Scamizdat #11, in several parts. The
original repost was done on 15.2.1996, and partly repeated 12.3.1996."
