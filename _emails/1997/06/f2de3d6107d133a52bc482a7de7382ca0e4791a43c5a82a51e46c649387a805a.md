  SnailMail Version 1.0 will soon be coming out. The product includes
a pen, paper, envelopes and instructions on how to purchase stamps.
  While it does not offer perfect security, the chances are that
the only person who might snoop through it is your postman. Since
he is probably banging your spouse, he's practically a member of
the family, anyway.
  SnailMail Version 1.0 also includes letter-size envelopes so that
you can print out a copy of your Web page and mail it without bending
or folding it.
