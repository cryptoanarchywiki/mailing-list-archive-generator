Hi Bill,

I have been doing somthing much simpler for providing an encrypted IRC.

Say you have a group of 5-10 crypto-anarchsist who wish to engage in a
secure coversation.

1 of the group runs ircd & sshd on his machine (perferabley the one with
the fastest machine/and or best connection).    

The rest of the group logs into his machine using irc & ssh clients.

All communication is encrypted to the outside world while in "plain text"
to the group.

The best part of this is it requires no modification to the "off the
shelf" software available.

Unfortunatly ssh is not very well known outside the Unix community. There
is an exelent port for OS/2 (freeware) and there is a port to winxx
(shareware) I don't know if a mac port is available.
