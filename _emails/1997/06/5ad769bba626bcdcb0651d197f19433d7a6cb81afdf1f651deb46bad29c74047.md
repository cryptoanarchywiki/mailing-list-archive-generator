This would actually not save as much time as it trivially appears to, the 
main time eater in pgp key generation is a. getting random seeds and 
mixing to distill randomness, and b. executing the extended euclidean 
algorithm to find modular inverses. 

Does anyone know any other speedups? - I`m sure I could think of a few 
but I`m really not in the mood ;-)...
