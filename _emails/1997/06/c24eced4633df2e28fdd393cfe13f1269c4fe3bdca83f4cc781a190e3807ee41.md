Well the real problem here is not GAK it is just a symptom.

The problem is the position that our current government and especially
LEAs in that government have taken that we have no rights. That the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights have no meaning unless it is
politically convienant to them.

I don't see how anyone can look at the governments behavior in its push
for GAK and not have utter contempt for them.
