I at least have a contractual relationship with both of them that provides
me at least some promise of fair arbitration. Something I don't have with
Joe Average implicitly.

The Machine takes the rights we give up willingly for a long-term loan on a
40" television and another $10k a year.

Not just religious views, but skin color, sex, etc. This is a function of
all social animals (in fact the society wouldn't work if it wasn't) and in
particular primates. To draw the conclusion that this somehow flows from our
contractual agreements based on impatience and greed is illogical.
