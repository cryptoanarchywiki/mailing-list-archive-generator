A Content Recovery Version (TM) is available from Trusted Disinformation
Systems (TDS), of Fort Meade, Maryland.

"Content Recovery is being demanded by many companies," said TDS President
Walker Harper. "Companies are fearful of not knowing what their employees
are sending, so they want Content Recovery for all outgoing mail. And it
meets the LNLE criteria (legitimate needs of law enforcement)."

TDS has licensed the technology under the tradename "Postcards."
