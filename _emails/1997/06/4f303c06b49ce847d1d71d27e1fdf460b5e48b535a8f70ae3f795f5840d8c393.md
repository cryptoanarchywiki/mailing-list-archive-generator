Are you referrring to him being one of the four or five in the "S & L
scandal"? MCain was indeed one of them, along with Alan Cranston of
California, who elected not to run again, and several others. This was
indeed a big new story, lasting at least two years, and McCain's reputation
was hurt badly by it.

And we may speculate that FinCEN and CIA had the goods on him, vis-a-vis
kickbacks, illegal contributions, bribes, and suchlike.

(FinCEN is the new J. Edgar Hoover, having dossiers of all financial
dealings. These dossiers can be used to make Congressvermin more compliant.)
