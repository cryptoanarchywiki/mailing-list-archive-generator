Well lets see,

While you were hobnobbing in DC today I did the following:

Spent time on the phone with PGP, Inc. going over various modifications
that I have been working on to the PGP code.

Spoke with 3 E-Mail vendors on the implementation of crypto to there
products.

Spent several hours on IRC disscussing with a group of IRC authors on the
design and implemntation of Private Encrypted channel to their IRC
products.

Exchanged E-Mail regurarding PGP/MIME update draft.

Spent the rest of the day writting & debuging crypto code.

So *EXACTLY* where are we behind the curve?

While you are playing your fanticy games in DC as self appointed defender
of "Truth, Justice, and the American Way" the rest of us were doing *REAL*
work bringing crypto to the masses.
