Well, maybe I should have said companies with the slightest clue *should* 
not be using 3DES, of course a lot of them are advised wrongly that 
single 56 bit DES is hard to break, indeed the succeptability of single 
DES to differential and linear cryptanalysis leaves me with a low level 
of condfidence about single DES period. Of course one could also say that 
by extension there is no reason why these methods of cryptanalysis could 
not be adapted to 3DES, I believe the NSA once claimed to have known 
about differential cryptanalysis since the 1970s??? in that case they are 
the ones who could, but won`t, tell you if in time 3DES can be broken by 
the same means as reduced round single DES.

Yes, I think that even accounted for the expected duplication of keyspace 
searched by the different efforts, it was a resounding success overall.

Foo. I said I applauded the effort from a publicity point of view, it 
gets the message out there to the public that a bunch of guys with normal 
home PCs can break the encryption the government has been telling them is 
strong. From a technical point of view it is unsuprising, can you 
honestly tell me you were suprised a distributed crack got 56 bit DES??? 
Therefore there are two sides to it, it is a good thing, and <yawn>...>

Yes, I do in fact, and I had not really considered this side of it so I 
thank you for bringing it to my attention, recognise the significance of 
the achievement from the distributed computing angle, it could so easily 
have gone spaghetti-wise. I just don`t recognise any real groundbreaking 
achievement in crypto terms, but of course it cost nothing, a hardware crack 
would have done it in days, but that is a different matter altogether, in 
both financial and PR terms, it would not be that impressive to crack DES 
with a custom DES cracker Wiener style, the real PR coup is that it was 
broken by an average home PC.
