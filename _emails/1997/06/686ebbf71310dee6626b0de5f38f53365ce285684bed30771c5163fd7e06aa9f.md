To the best of my knowledge neither CDT nor any of the individual authors
has been served with any papers or received any other notice of a suit
regarding the key recovery report. (Available at
http://www.crypto.com/key_study)

I suspect that the last thing IBM would want to do is give this experts'
report
more publicity.  At this point, rumors of a lawsuit appear to be unfounded.

And remember: In libel cases, truth is always a defense.  :)
