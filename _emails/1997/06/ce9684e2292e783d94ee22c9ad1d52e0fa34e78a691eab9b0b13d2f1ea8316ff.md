Noah's story about Wired trademarking Digital Revolution (tm) is at:

  http://pathfinder.com/netly/editorial/0,1012,192,00.html

	"  Have our friends at Wired gone mad? We always thought the
	Digital Revolution was about freedom of information, erasing
	of boundaries, creating global community, throwing off the
	shackles of government and evoking a spirit of unfettered,
	bottom-up business and entrepreneurialism. Was this yet another
	case of lawyers running amok? Or was it pre- Initial Public
	Offering jitters on Wired's part?
