 What d'ya mean??? PGP 5.0 is much more (not USD 50 in any case);
freeware PGP (latest version 2.6.2 for USA and 2.6.3i outside US)
is working just fine in MS-Dos shell under windoze'95... If you
mean specific shell (what I doubt), it's not PGP itself and you'll
still will get those dos windows anyway...
