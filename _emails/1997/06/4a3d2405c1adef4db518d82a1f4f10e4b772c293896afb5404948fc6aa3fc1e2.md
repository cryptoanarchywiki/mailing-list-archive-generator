A lot of work that could better be spent in other areas.

Why doesn't one of the many persons with access to the PGP 5.0 code already
in machine readable form just mail it to the group doing the scanning and
whatnot?

(Using remailers, obviously. And even making it look like a porno image
file. Whatever. Even easier: just put the source code CD-ROM in an envelope
and mail it to Norway. "Duh.")

This would shorten the process, and the Norwegian group could announce
"We're done!!!"

So, PGP employees, do it today.

(Or send me the source on CD-ROM.....)

Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
