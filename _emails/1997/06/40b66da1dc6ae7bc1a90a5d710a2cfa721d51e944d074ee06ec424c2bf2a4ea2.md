It was suggested that I look a little at McCain, so here is a dribble; 
I think it's instructive to see the following PAC's on McCains feedlist.

Anyone who thinks that these Co.'s won't profit tremendously in the
deployment of a
Federally-designed and mandated PKI is taking the wrong drugs .....
(note: obviously these figures are meaningless in terms of actual $$$
amounts. They
only serve to indicate that real soft money is flowing from the same
source.)
