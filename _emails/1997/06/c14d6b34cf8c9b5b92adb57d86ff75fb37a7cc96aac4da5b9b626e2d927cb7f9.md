No, the keys are not stored in the files in anything worth it`s salt, and 
if it is a passwd file it`ll be hashed anyway.

Depends entirely on the software, there are freely available crackers for 
files from a lot of micro$oft stuff, and some other popular programs such 
as pkzip etc... Otherwise get a good cryptgrapher to look at the 
software, run a sniffer on the network, a keygrabber on the machine, or 
give up.

For a good introduction covering much of the stuff you need try the 
sci.crypt FAQ.
