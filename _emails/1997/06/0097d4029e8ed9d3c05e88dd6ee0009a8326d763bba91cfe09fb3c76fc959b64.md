I sometimes think that Oregon is being used as a beta test for some of the
more draconian laws due for the rest of the country.

An example is the new law waiting to be signed by the Govenor.  It would
expand the reasons a cop can use to detain and search you.  Currently they
need to have probable cause that you committed a crime.  The new law
expands that to probible cause that you are about to commit a crime and a
whole host of things they can detain and question you on.  (The TV
coverage has been less than good.  The TV anchor they had covering it was
pushing it as a good idea.  Only until later did they bring up any reasons
of protest.) 

Yet another tool to keep the masses down.
