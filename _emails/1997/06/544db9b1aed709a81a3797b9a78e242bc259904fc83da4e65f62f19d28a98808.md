Israel? I don't get the joke....

Israel is a controlling, f$sc%st state in many ways. (I typed "f$sc%st"
because many are unreasonably offended when the f-word is used in
conjuction with the Zionist Entity.)

Look into IDF control of most of the leading Israeli electronics companies.
Look into Shin Bet, Mossad, the Pollard case, Dimona, and so on.

Also, Israel is one of the world's major "soft targets." Look to see Tel
Aviv vaporized one of these days. A nation formed by stealing land from
"sand niggers" (what the Brits called Arabs) and having these sand niggers
only a few miles across a poor geographic barrier....the very definition of
a soft target.

As for a lot of "interesting work," there is no doubt that Shamir and his
students are doing wonderful work. One genius and his team do not make up
for the many other problems with Israel.

(If the Germans are able to get Scientology declared to be a dangerous
cult, partly because of its violent activities and its strange beliefs,
can't they have Judaism similarly declared to be an illegal cult? A cult
which believes God gave them some land, and that Jews born in Poland,
Russia, Lithuania, and not having any ancestors in Palestine for 1000 or
2000 or more years (or never), have a religious right to kick the sand
niggers off their farms in Haifa....sounds worse than Scientology. By the
way, I strongly disagree with  the German assault on Scientology....I have
told my good friend Keith Henson that his battle with Scientology is
dangerous.)
