I had thought that Jims court appearance was to be sometime about a week 
ago, what was he actually charged with? Has he appeared in court yet?

Indeed, Jim is without doubt under arrest not on whatever cooked-up 
charges they are holding him on, but because of AP and his "loon" type 
possesion of carbon fibers etc. Jim certainly deserves our support, who 
next otherwise? You?

Not enough cypherpunks ever get round to writing significant code, myself 
included. I have lost count of the number of times I have sat down at a 
workstation overnight, got some way into starting a project, then just 
given up on it. I hope someone does go and see Jim, at the very least it 
would be a pleasant gesture and give Jim the message that the cypherpunks 
haven`t forgotten about him. Sure, It`s easy for me to talk, I can`t go 
and see him, I`m hardly in his neighbourhood, but if you shrug your 
shoulders and ignore his position it could be you next.
