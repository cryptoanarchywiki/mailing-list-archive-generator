Exactly.  And if you put an e-mail address on a web-site, it's fair 
game.  You consent to have me, at least, comment.

Like any spammer listens to those anyway.  I was sent so many of 
those when I started, it didn't scare me at all.  But now I'm a 
reformed, kinder, gentler spammer.  Most times they don't even know 
they've been spammed.

You bet.  I'm bummed that I missed out on this whole conversation, 
it's a week old now.

That's right.  I've got different lists for the different places that 
I harvested them from.

Please.  I beg all of you just to let it settle it's self.  No 
regulation is needed, or wanted.  It's not that bad.

I don't want anyone telling me what I have to put into the subject

Declan, thanks.  You are right that speech is speech.

That's not what this is about.

It's about freedom to tell people about a product in any way that you 
can.
