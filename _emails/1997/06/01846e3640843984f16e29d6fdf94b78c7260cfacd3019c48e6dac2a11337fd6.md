This is an interesting insight into the underpinnings of a democracy or
republic. The secret to success and ultimate limitation of government
authority is people standing up and saying "Hell NO!, I won't take it any
more." In short, for democracy (any democracy I suspect) to work it REQUIRES
people being unwilling to compromise. So many people labor under the
impression that compromise is how they get to where they want to be. Very
successful indoctrination I suspect...
