Sheesh is right!!

Dorothy is a boot licking government toad, period. Whatever reputation
capital she may have aquired as a cryptologist she burned up with her
continued support of the numerous darconian plans of the government.

I am really amazed that anyone pays any attention on what she has to say
as I doubt that she is capable of adding anything of importance regardless
of who is paying her to say it.
