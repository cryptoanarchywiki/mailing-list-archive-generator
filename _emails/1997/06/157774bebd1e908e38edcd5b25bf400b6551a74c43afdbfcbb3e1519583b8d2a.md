Hi Duffy,

First, let me say it has been quite pleasant dealing with you on this issue.
I appreciate your even-headed approach.

Agreed.

Unfortunately in this case my policy was diametricaly opposed to yours.
Unless somebody is a paying customer or has legal justification I don't
comply with a great many external requests, I try to make as few as possible
as well.

I support a wide range of users and they specificaly request that I keep
them up to date with what is going on in a variety of technology areas.
Not only do I send a copius amount of forwards from various mailing lists, 
print sources, etc. but I also keep a webpage with some critical links to
resources they have inquired about. Don's was one of them.

A sign of an honorable business.

> Again, I apologize for any inconvenience in this matter.

Not a problem. Sounds like you have been the one inconvenienced by this
the most.
