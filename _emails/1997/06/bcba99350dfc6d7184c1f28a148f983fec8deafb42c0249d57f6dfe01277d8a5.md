Excellent take almost of the quality of the Cypherpunks Enquirer's
work.  Well done.

I have one comment on punctuation style, notice that through out the
document the author uses the wrong single quote, viz:

> Tim:
>
> No it isn`t,...

There's only one poster to the list who uses the wrong quote mark in
this way consistently.  (Exercise for reader).

On the other hand the anonymous posters may have done this on purpose
to obfuscate writing style, and throw is off the track.
