I can think of a number of reasons why a business would want to remain
"hidden".  Fear of retribution is the biggest.  This could be "valid"
retribution (such as for selling shoddy products or annoying sales
practices) or "invalid" retribution (such as selling a product that
offends the local moral or legal establishment), but is a product that
people desire and are willing to pay money for.

But such markets are "illegal" and thus not to be thought about by good
little citizen units.
