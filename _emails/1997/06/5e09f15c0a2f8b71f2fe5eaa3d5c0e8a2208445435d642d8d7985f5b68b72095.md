The defendant is perfectly able to bring charges in this matter against
James Dolan personally.  There is precedent in this.  If my read of
the judge is accurate he is saying, "go after him because he was acting
outside his office".

I can't remember the exact name of this decision, but I think it was
something like "so-and-so vs. 5 unnamed FBI officers".

I'm not a lawyer and I'm not sure how one would proceed in this case,
but some official anti-IRS group should fund it.
