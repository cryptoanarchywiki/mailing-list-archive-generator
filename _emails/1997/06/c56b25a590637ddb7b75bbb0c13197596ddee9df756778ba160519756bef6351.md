The General Accounting Office has published an astonishing list
of over 4,000 Federal Websites, many not well-known, with hyperlinks 
for easy access:

-  World Wide Web Sites: Reported by 42 Federal Organizations.
   GGD-97-86S. June 1, 1997. 
   http://www.gao.gov/new.items/gg97086s.pdf

It's a supplement to an assessment of federal electronic 
information systems:

-  Internet and Electronic Dial-Up Bulletin Board System Activities:
   Information Reported by Federal Organizations. GGD-97-86. June
   16, 1997. 
   http://www.gao.gov/new.items/gg97086.pdf

We note the also amazingly-revealing GovBot Database of Government
Websites which provides search and access to 308,000 government and
military web pages:
