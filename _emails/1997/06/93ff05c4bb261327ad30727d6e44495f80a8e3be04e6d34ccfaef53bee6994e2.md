Torture is a means of producing an irrational state in people's
minds (at least temporarily), thus causing them to do things they
would not rationally do (sign a prepared confession, reveal a secret, 
etc) If torture could not do this, it would not be used; verbal
persuasion over tea and crumpets is *so* much more pleasant.

Even people who might be able to face a more or less painless 
death with equanimity (in the pursuit of some greater cause) 
may break down as the bamboo splints are pushed under their 
fingernails.

'Rational torture victim' is an oxymoron.
