| What they don't say is Far more interesting:
| 
| They don't say that key escrow is unacceptable, period.
| 
| They don't mention the big brother problem.
| 
| They don't talk about the long history of
| government abuse (FBI, CIA, NSA, etc).
| 
| The conveniently leave out ALL the libertarian issues about how key escrow making the government bigger and more powerful.
| 
| They just seem to care about what it costs.  And
| these are our friends?
