>      6-11-97, Janes' Defence Weekly:

>      Thumbnail-sized micro-robots, known as `microbots', will
>      also be unleashed by micro-air vehicles and naval guns. These
>      parasites will creep into electronic equipment, attach
>      themselves, and keep themselves alive by draining generator
>      power. 
> 
>      Once the electronics system's energy is depleted, the fully
>      charged microscopic vermin will search for a new victim. 
> 
>      The main problem will be that they are too small to carry
>      identification equipment and so they infect indiscriminately.
>      As such, they must be deployed far away from allied
>      equipment. 
> 
>      However, packages of microbots can be destroyed remotely
>      as allies prepare to invade enemy territory.
