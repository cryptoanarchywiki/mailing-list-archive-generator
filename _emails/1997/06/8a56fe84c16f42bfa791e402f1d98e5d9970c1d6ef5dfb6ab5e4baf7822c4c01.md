I believe historically this would not be the case, for obvious reasons of 
reputation.

Today, a few English people take both their mothers and fathers names, 
for example, a friend of mine is William Casson-Smith, of course, not all 
names sound good like this, ie. Paul Bradley-Hemsley, interestingly they 
only sound right if the second name has one less syllable than the first.
