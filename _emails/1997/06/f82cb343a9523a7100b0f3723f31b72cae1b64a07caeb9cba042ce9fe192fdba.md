  Am I missing something? Didn't we used to have one of those?
Wasn't that changed so that government and corporate interests
could put us all in more efficient boxes to control us and make
money off of us?
  Some states already use the SSN on the driver's licenses. More
will follow. The SSN is our National Identity Card and there is
no going back. The tattoo is history and the Identity Chip is the
future.
