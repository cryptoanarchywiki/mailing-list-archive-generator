Too simple.  Escrow for ecash isn't to allow forging cash, or stealing it.
It allows tracing it.

If you tell financial experts that making ecash traceable under court order is
goint to make electronic commerce impossible, they'll laugh.  They already
use systems which are even less private than that.
