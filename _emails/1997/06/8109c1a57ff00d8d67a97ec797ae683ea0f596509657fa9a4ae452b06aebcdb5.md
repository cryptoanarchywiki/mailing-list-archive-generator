Schneier (the quote you give) gives this table (some values omitted):

# of bits		MIPS-years required to factor
512 bits		3*10^4
1024 bits		3*10^11
1536 bits		3*10^16
2048 bits		3*10^20

How are you extrapolating that to 4096 bits?  Hardness to break
increases as a superpolynomial function of the key size.  The memory
requirements increase with key sizes, also, which I don't think these
figures are taking into account.

If someone would like to post the big O notation for GNFS space and
time complexity, plus current estimates of the constants, perhaps we
could improve upon that.

I reckon my estimate is conservative, if hardness relates to cost,
rather than mathematical number of operations ignoring memory
considerations.
