Here's an interesting question:
What happens when your star technical witness tells others she's no longer 
your witness at all?
Denning now says she has doubts...

(Responses? I'm no longer on cypherpunks, so mail me directly.

Cheers

Administration Supporter Having Second Thoughts On Encryption Plan

By Will Rodger 1:30 PM EDT

Nixon went to China. Constantine converted to Christianity. Napoleon crowned 
himself emperor.

So why can't Dorothy Denning be a cypherpunk?

That's the question encryption mavens ask as the Georgetown University 
computer scientist slowly lets the word out: She won't back government plans 
for key recovery, key escrow or anything else alleged to increase national 
security until backers show that the benefits of controls on encryption 
outweighs those of letting free market forces govern its use.

That's a far cry from the way she once talked about encryption technology. As 
recently as this year Denning was pegged as a strong backer of keeping 
controls on a wide range of computer-security products.

"Maybe export controls should be lifted," Denning said. "But I'm not saying 
that all controls should be lifted. I've gotten into a state where I don't 
know and I'm not sure that I ever knew."

Denning may be the only prominent cryptographer to support government control 
of encryption technology, the underlying technology behind nearly all 
Internet security devices that scramble information so even the wiliest 
hacker is powerless to decode it. As the author of the first widely read 
textbook on the subject, her opinion carries weight with at least some in the 
encryption community.

Since encryption can be used to defeat lawful wiretaps and other electronic 
searches and seizures, Denning backed law enforcement as it tried to fight 
encryption's spread abroad.

But now a host of objections to the Clinton administration's plan have turned 
the argument on its head. As the Internet becomes more popular for business 
use, encryption is more important than ever to keep hackers out. And a recent 
cryptographer's report suggesting that it would be far riskier to give 
governments spare keys to decode messages in a few places than not to have 
third party access at all has clearly shaken Denning's confidence.

Policy specialists in Washington and elsewhere have speculated that Denning 
would announce something soon, but none wants to push her for fear of 
alienating someone who could end up a potent ally.

"I don't think any close scientific observer of this debate can deny that 
there are real technical concerns raised by the Administration's position," 
said Alan Davidson, counsel with the Center for Democracy and Technology.

"I think its just best for us to sit back and not say anything at this 
point," added another prominent activist. "We don't want to force her hand."

Will Denning go over to the other side?

"I'm not advocating anything anymore," Denning said. "I support what the 
administration is doing because I really see them struggling with these 
things."
