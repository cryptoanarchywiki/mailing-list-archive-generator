I think that your analogy is slightly flawed.

While the farmers have a right to protest on the side of the road they do
not have a right to interfere with the travelers on the road.

There is no real way you could picket on the "Info highway" as you have no
right to interfere with the packets traveling on the highway. You can
stand of to the side if you want but somehow I don't think that the
packets will be watching. :)
