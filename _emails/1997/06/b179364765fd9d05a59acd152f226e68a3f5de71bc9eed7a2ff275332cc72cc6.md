Yes, I think you will also find that most people in mainland England 
don`t really have an opinion one way or the other, they vaguely feel that 
the British should pull out of NI because they want to stop the bombings, 
they also vaguely feel that would be giving in to "terrorists".

One of the reasons I don`t really have a strong opinion one way or the 
other about the NI question is because I believe a British withdrawal 
would simply result in the replacement of one set of corrupt political 
rulers with another. The Irish parliament is no better than any other 
government, no suprise there.
