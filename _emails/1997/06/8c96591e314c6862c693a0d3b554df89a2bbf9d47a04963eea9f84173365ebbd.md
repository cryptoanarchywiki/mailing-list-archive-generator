I find Kents posts usefull even though I don't agree with them.

He serves a usefull purpors in many respects.

1: He provides a window into the thinkings of the opposition.

2: Replying to his posts help us to form answers to attacks on various
positions that members of the list support.

3: Gives us pause to reflect on our positions on various issues (who know
he may even be right every now and them <G>).

4: It's no fun preaching to the choir.
