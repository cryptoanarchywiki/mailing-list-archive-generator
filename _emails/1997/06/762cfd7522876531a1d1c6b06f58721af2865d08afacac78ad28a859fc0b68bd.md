The ones you really have to watch out for are my logical spitballs.  
But I am deeply flattered that you take me so seriously.

You are completely misrepresenting me here -- I distinctly said 
"grandmother of the first cousin".  And my favorite theme is from one 
of the Brandenberg Concertos.

You have a point there.  You will search in vain for a stitch of 
reality in this post.

It's pointless to reply to Dimitri -- he filters my posts.  Of course 
I would be delighted to engage in a civilized discourse with him, but 
it's impossible.

A revealing paragraph, indeed.
