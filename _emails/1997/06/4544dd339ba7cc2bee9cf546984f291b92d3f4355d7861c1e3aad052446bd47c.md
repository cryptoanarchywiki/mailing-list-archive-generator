seems they are in the final process of rewriting clients entirely, with
a new protocol, etc... so they don't bother explaining how the old
clients work. Still, I agree it sucks.

here is the best that I found on that subject in the rc5 list archive..

   rc5.exe -l -a outland.hway.net -a2 rc5proxy.distributed.net -s -k 20
   jonass@lysator.liu.se
     
     
   -l is logging (writes to a file)
   -a primary server to use
   -a2 secondary server
   -s shows status
   -k number of blocks to buffer local. The larger number the less you
   have to be online
     
          
   This does not hide it, but that is what I like.
   You start it (beeing online), wait until it got all blocks and then
   go offline. Later you can go online any time. It will report any
   blocks finished and get new ones to fill up the 20 slots buffer.
   Unless you use the -o option or the -z option the client will try to
   connect every 2 minutes after finishing the first block so be careful
   if you have any kind of dial-on-demand.

and from strings you get
Usage: %s [-m] [-n level] [-c count] [-h hours]
       [-a <address>] [-p <port>] <identity>

doesn't say that much... but you can try the -k option to see if it
works with the linux client.  I don't need that as I am on-line anyway.

> Also, no source code.

there have been some discussions about that on the list, they seem to
fair bogus datas sent to the servers. Kind of makes sense, but they
could at least release the core source without the communication
protocol...

                    F.
