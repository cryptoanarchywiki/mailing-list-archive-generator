Hi Vinnie.  I'm with Tim on this one.  While I have strong feelings about
locking up people, I have no compunctions at all about locking up
program-instances.  If I can contain the instances, and especially keep
them limited in their file access, I can do a bunch to control viruses and
other nasties.  (BTW - Linux, like all Unixes is piss poor at limiting file
system access.)

Best Regards - Bill
