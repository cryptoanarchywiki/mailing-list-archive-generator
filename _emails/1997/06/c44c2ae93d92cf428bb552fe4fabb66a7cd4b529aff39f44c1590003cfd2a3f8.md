You can't go underground if cryptography is illegal.  You don't have remailers,
so you can't be anonymous.  You don't have crypto, so anyone can see what
you're doing online.  It doesn't work.

You can't ignore the laws.  You can't ignore society.  The real world is all
around you, and you have to live in it.

People are tired.  We win one battle, and have to begin again with another.
But that's the way it works.  Look at the political battles which have gone on
for decades: gun control, abortion, environmentalism, many more.  You have
to be in this for the long haul.  You have to fight every step of the way.

Don't give up.
