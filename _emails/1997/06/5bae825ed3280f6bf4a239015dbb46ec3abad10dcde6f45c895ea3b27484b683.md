You'll have a secure black box then. Everything in the black box
is secure, but the real information comes from watching what goes
in one side and out the other. Unless there is an astronomical amount 
of traffic, it will be fairly obvious who's doing what.

After all, knowing who did what is the goal of traffic analysis, usually 
not what route they took in between.

The trick is to design a system where an eavesdropper can't correlate
a connection into the anonymous network to one coming out. Such a system will 

almost certainly involve some sort of "personal proxy" running on your own 
machine. It might maintain a constant bandwidth to the anonymous network, but 

that's sub-optimal since most people like their bandwidth for other things.
