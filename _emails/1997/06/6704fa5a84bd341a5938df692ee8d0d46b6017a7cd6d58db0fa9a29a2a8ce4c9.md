Likewise, anyone interested in Assassination Politics should get ahold of
the CIA's training manual for assassins and covert operatives. This manual
was used extensively in training locals in Nicaragua to kill members of the
democratically elected government in Nicaragua. (And Diem, and Lumumba, and
Guevara, and on and on.)

Interestingly, when a Pakistani (or maybe Afghani) native practiced AP on
some CIA agents at the front gate of the Langley facility, the CIA then
spent $5 million tracking him down, even paying $2-3 M in finders fees.

Though I rather suspect finding the CIA's domestic field offices might be
tough, so asking for a copy of the CIA's manual on assassination would be
problematic. Too bad nobody has bothered yet to scan and OCR it and put it
on the Web. Now _that_ would be a blow!

Foreign offices of the CIA might be easier to locate. Just walk up to any
embassy gate and ask to speak to the Cultural Attache.

(And various CIA and DIA agents in various countries have their names
published in the opposition press, the same kinds of press that Germany and
other neo-fascist regimes are shutting down, a al Radikal and Integral and
whatnot.)
