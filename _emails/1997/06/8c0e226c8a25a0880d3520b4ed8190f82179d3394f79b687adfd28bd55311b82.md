We have to live with the fact that industry has a janus head.
On one hand - and here we should follow their example - they 
are reluctant to allow somebody else to keep their keys in trust.
On the other hand - in contradiction to the previous - they 
invest in development of key escrow systems including key 
management protocols which allow third parties having 
uncontrolled access to keys.
