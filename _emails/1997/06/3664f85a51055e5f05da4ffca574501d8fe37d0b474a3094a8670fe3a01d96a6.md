Do I have to spell out everything for you?  "Style of government" as in
governmental *DESIGN*, not the current situation.  I'm talking about the
layout of Congress, the Executive branch, the Supreme Court, etc.  I'm not
discussing who is in the Congress, the Executive branch, or the Supremem
Court at this point in time.

This whole discussion has been, from my point of view at least, mostly
theoretical in a discussion of possible ways to alter the government to
stay away from the situations that we are in now.

Buy you're own fucking clue.
