The use of any printing press in the ....

The use of speech in the ...

Per the 1st, 9th & 10th;

"The use of <blah> in the ...." is un-Constitutional.

Now, I can see committing a crime using some facility or special skill might
exacerbate the verdict, is that the intent? We could just do away with the
preamble and go with exacerbating the verdict if a special skill or facility
is required.

If nothing else it eliminates any pretense of spontinaity, in effect
pre-meditation or aggravation. From that perspective I don't see a
Constitutional issue except regarding the punishment phase.
