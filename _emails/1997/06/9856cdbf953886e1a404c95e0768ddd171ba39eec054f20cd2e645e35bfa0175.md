The obvious solution is to register all hands. Hands must be kept away from
children. To protect children, a hand shall not be transported to within 1000 
yards of any school, playground or daycare facility. All concealed carry
hands 
must be registered. Concealed carry is banned in all government facilities, 
especially US Post Offices, and all public buildings including, but not
limited 
to airports, bus stations, train depots and taxi stands.

Furthermore, there shall be a 15-day waiting period and a background check 
before the purchase of any legal hand can be completed. Anyone caught with an
unregistered hand shall have that hand immediately confiscated and be liable
to a fine and/or imprisonment. 

The ownership of fully-automatic hands, assault hands, ugly hands, or
cop-killer
gloves is expressly forbidden.
