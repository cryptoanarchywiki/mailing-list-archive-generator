I would have thought this was obvious, clearly not. Distributing any 
information is exercising ones right to free speech. Just because the 
speech happens to offend you does not make it wrong, I also find that 
often it is the most censorous that are the most repressed, I`m sure the 
poster probably has a collection of child pornography, or maybe just sits 
on the beach watching small boys?
