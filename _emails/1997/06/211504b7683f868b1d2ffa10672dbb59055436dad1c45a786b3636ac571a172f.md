Go there.  Learn about mail-filtering.  

Do a /Altavista|Hotbot|Yahoo|etc./ web search on "spam solutions."
Find one that suits your taste.

If you don't like it, fix it yourself.  Don't whine to the list about
receiving spam.  If you're on the net, you receive spam.  Some of us,
however, rarely have to see it.

If you want to discuss a crypto-relevant topic with implications for
the spam issue, search for and read up on "digital postage."

Do something to protect your own privacy before you run about
screeching about your "rights" to it.

Welcome to Cypherpunks.
