   Private dollars wanted for next Net
   By [34]Courtney Macavinta
   June 5, 1997, 3:20 p.m. PT
   
   SANTA CLARA, California--A White House official's call was dropped
   when he tried to patch into a high-tech industry powwow about the
   [35]Next Generation Internet (NGI) today--a timely demo of the
   network's need for a facelift.
   
   [36]NASA's Ames Research Center hosted the federal government's
   briefing today in hopes of roping in commercial technology partners to
   help build the Clinton Administration's three-year, $3 million NGI
   initiative.
   
   The NGI initiative aims to build a faster, smarter Internet, creating
   new applications and networking technologies to improve communication
   among the nation's academic and research centers. In some cases, NGI
   will route data at 1,000 times the speed of today's network, and will
   be able to store bandwidth for real-time data transmission.
   
   The audience laughed when the videoconferencing connection from
   Washington to the Techmart in Santa Clara crashed. But the White
   House's senior director of the National Economic Council, Thomas
   Kalil, spun the mishap into a plea for his cause.
   
   "This certainly shows why dependability and reliability need to be a
   priority for the Next Generation Internet," Kalil said when he finally
   got connected.
   
   Just as the private sector and universities assisted in creating
   ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet, Kalil and representatives from
   NASA and the [37]Energy Department want companies and the government
   to build the NGI as a team.
   
   Companies could benefit by receiving federal funds for research and
   development; they would be able to keep copyrights of their products
   in order to commercialize them, said Maylene Duenas of NASA Ames.
   
   In return the government will get input and expertise from industry
   without recreating existing private research or making the same
   mistakes. Federal agencies and research facilities also need NGI to
   shoot huge volumes of secure data across the country.
   
   "Past investments in this area have a high return on investment,"
   Kalil said. "We would like to see the United States maintain its
   position as a charter of innovation."
   
   California is already heading up a private/public Internet
   partnership.
   
   Dubbed the [38]Corporation for Network Education Initiatives in
   California (CENIC), the organization's goal is to oversee the
   development and operation of an improved data network between the
   state's university research centers.
   
   [39]Pacific Bell has already struck a deal to set aside some of its
   bandwidth for the project. "Private involvement is critical," Susan
   Astrada, executive director of CENIC said today. "There is no way the
   academic community could afford it."
   
   [40]Sun, [41]Cisco, [42]Silicon Graphics, [43]Novell, [44]Lucent
   Technologies, and [45]MCI have already endorsed NGI or plan to work on
   the project in various capacities.
   
   Although the general public won't be able use the infrastructure for
   five to ten years, the NGI initiative makes several promises that the
   White Hose says will trickle down to all Net surfers.
   
   For example, developers are working with the creators of [46]Internet
   2, a separate project funded by academia.
   
   More than 100 universities across the country are spearheading the
   project to develop new computer network applications to help improve
   their teaching and research facilities. The academic community will
   invest $50 million a year to connect the schools' students and faculty
   at speeds 100 times faster than the current network.
   
   Another component of NGI will connect just ten research facilities
   nationwide at speeds 1,000 times faster than the Internet.
   
   This means the Energy Department could send its reports of global
   climate changes over the NGI in 15 seconds. The data takes 15 minutes
   to send now, said Martha Krebs of the government agency.
   
   Not all are happy with Clinton's plan for the next Internet.
   Yesterday, senators from Alaska to Montana told the president's
   technical advisers that NGI was leaving out rural universities by
   turning only to well-known urban institutions for guidance.
