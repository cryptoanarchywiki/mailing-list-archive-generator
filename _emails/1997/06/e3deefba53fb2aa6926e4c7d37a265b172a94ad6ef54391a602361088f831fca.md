Ah, you have cleverly rewritten the standard definition:

The Definition of the Strength of a Firewall is how many
politicians one can put  in front of it for summary execution
before it crumbles.

McCain, Kerrey, Hollings, et. al. are guilty of treason and should be put
in front of that firewall forthwith.

(As a free citizen, I am free to say that any particular person has
committed crimes deserving of execution. Despite what pseudo-lawyers often
claim. I have never said I plan to kill McCain or Kerrey. An important
difference. But they will surely pay for their crimes. Congress and
Washington need a taste of their own vile medicine.)

Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
