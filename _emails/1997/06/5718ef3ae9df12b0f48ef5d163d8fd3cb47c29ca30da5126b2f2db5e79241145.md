The New York Times reports on page one the German
prosecution of a woman who linked her home page to 
Radikal. It reviews XS4ALL's role, describes Radikal
and its mirror sites and links to them all:

   http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/060697germany.html

It says that Kohl is determined to find a way to police the
Net in spite of technical work-a-rounds.

Recall a previous report that Kohl and other heads of state are 
to meet in Denver on June 20-22 to plan a global attack
on "cyber-terrorism," including the spread of encryption:
