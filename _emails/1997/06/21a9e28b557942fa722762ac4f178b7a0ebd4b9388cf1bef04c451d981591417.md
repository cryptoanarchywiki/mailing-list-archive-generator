        A huge number of passwords to pay-only porn sites are loose on
   the Net. Just surf newsgroups like alt.sex.passwords or do a simple
   search through a typical web engine and long lists of logins are easy
   to find.

There is an easy solution to this problem.  Just use one-time passwords.
Put it in a cookie.  Every time the customer accesses the service you give
him a new one.  He doesn't have to do anything.  If he gives his password
away it won't work for him any more.
