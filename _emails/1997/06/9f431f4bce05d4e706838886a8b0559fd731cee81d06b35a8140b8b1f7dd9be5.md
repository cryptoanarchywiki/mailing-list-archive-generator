You rang? (He said, feeling particularly ambitious on a rainy June afternoon)

You don't need an organization, a simple angry swarm of the right players
is just fine, preferrably large commercial ones.

You just need to tell them that S909 will kill the commercial internet, and
all the billions that have been invested in it.


The big stick to smack the hive with, the argument to present to those
people who have the most to lose, is the following, if I may quote myself
from several places this week :-):

I will deliver the above talk to anyone who pays my travel expenses and can
get butts in the seats to hear it. The "right" butts or no, you never know
who knows somebody else.

You buy, I fly. If anyone *else* wants to make the above presentation, and
save the air and hotel bill, feel free. Practically *anyone* on this list
knows how to more than adequately defend each of those propositions against
all comers, foreign and domestic. :-).


Now, then. When do we get started?

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
