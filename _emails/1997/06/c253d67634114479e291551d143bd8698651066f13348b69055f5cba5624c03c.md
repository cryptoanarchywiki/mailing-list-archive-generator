|         Counterpoint: Ban Flag Burning?
| 
|         It's baaaack.....! The House is set to vote June 12 on
| 	a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would
| 	ban flag desecration. Democratic Rep. William
| 	Lipinksi, a lead sponsor, says the flag is too
| 	important a symbol not to be protected, while ACLU
| 	executive director Ira Glasser warns against
| 	weakening the First Amendment.

	Would a Flag Burning Ammendment give the court clear guidance
that other offensive speech, not ammended against, is now more ok?
