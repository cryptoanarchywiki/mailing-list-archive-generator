Of course it would.  So would current bank/brokerage/business records. 
So would your personal records (if they were interesting) and money
(if there was enough of it).  Certainly keys in a government TTP would
be a easier target than some.  But (since we are here) Nazi Germany is
proof that there are plenty of other targets, perhaps not quite as
juicy, but just as viable.  And Nazi Germany is also proof that strong
crypto really doesn't do much good when the rubber hoses can be
deployed without hinderance.

In fact, your safety and wealth depends in large measure on the
protections provided by that government you scorn.  In any healthy
tyranny the jackboots would have been on your throat long ago,
regardless of your little arsenal, and your money would be purchasing 
toys for the rulers.

Perhaps.  It's a mere matter of degree, though -- the point is that 
the government already has power to compel reporting in many cases, 
and life goes on...

Well, good.  That's my view of it, also.

Like shooting fish in a barrel, really.  Anyway, you know that I don't
favor GAK, so where are you coming from?  All I have ever said is 
that there is strong corporate demand for enterprise level key 
recovery.

That's the rub.  You say "voluntary -- who cares", but fight tooth and
nail when customer demand forces companies like PGP and TIS to
implement some form of key recovery -- rather than face the facts, you
claim it's all government pressure and brainwashing, and advocate
employee sabotage of company products.  Well, there certainly is
government pressure, but there is *also* legitimate, informed, demand.

Certainly.

I rather doubt it, also.  However, escrow of communications keys is,
in my opinion, not only completely illegitimate, but idiotic from
a technical point of view.  So, I think this effort on the part of the
gov will fail.

Some might see this as ultimate fascism...in the long run, putting the
force monopoly purely under control of those with money.  In any 
case, speculation.

I generally don't read "Wired".  Geez -- I don't even have time to
read the "archives"...  :-)
