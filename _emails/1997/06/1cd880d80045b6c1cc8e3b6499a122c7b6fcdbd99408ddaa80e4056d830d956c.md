Straw man.  There is no evidence that such activities are being engaged
in, photographed, and uploaded to the Internet by the perpetrator. 

There is a huge difference between crimes being illegal, and crime scene
pictures being illegal in the possession of someone having no link
whatsoever to the original perpetrator. 

There is an even larger difference in scenes of very old non-crimes being
illegal in the possession of anyone whatsoever. 

All of these things get lumped under the general catch-all phrase "child
porn."

Take the officer's name and badge number.  He needs to be fired.
