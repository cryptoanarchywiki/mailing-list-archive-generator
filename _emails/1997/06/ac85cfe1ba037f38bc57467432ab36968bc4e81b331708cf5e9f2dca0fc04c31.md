  i just picked up greg bear's new SF novel _Slant_.  it's set in mid-
next-century.  i'm only twenty pages into it, so i can't honestly give
it a recommendation yet, but the following is from one of the "chapter
intro" quotes, and it has some cypherpunk-topical stuff in the author's
'techie gobbledygook' in the 2nd paragraph

  [note: possibly offensive ... but if you're on this list, why am i
   bothering to warn you?  :-) ]
