The recent post by John Young about the German woman charged with linking 
to Radikal caused me to investigate this issue.

You may have heard that Radikal had an article on sabotaging train
systems. The article simply stated that if you break open a certain type
of control box found next to train tracks and yank the circuit boards, the
trains will refuse to enter the given track segment. Hardly the worst of
possible sabotages and considerably less fatal than other methods discussed
on a mailing list near you. 

BTW, the woman has now been slapped with a new charge. Apparently it is 
illegal in Germany to publish criminal complaints. [Due to privacy 
regulations?]

Since the woman has the official paperwork detailing the charges against
her on her web site, she has now been charged *again* for violating the
prohibition against publishing the official court documents. 

Things are better in Europe? You must to be joking.
