If this report is true it's worth taking a look at IBM's policy paper
"The need for a global cryptographic policy framework" to 
understand why the key study report is such a threat to
Blue's global market strategy:

   http://www.ibm.com/security/html/pp_global.html

IBM's economic incentive to attack the report is substantial, not
least because it hopes to garner the lion's share of global GAK --
not that that's news.
