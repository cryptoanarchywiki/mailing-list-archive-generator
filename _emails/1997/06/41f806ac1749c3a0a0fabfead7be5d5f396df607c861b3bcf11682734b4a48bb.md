About 6 months ago, Shell introduced pre-paid cards in $25, 50 and 100
denominations which could be used to ~anonymously pay for gas at the pump.
Suddenly, Shell has withdrawn all but the nearly-pointless $25 cards.

Security problems?

Complaints from the Freehdom usurpers?

Inquiring minds want to know.
