Indeed, the same. The same as those righteous pastors 
who nudged us youngsters to sow oats across the Rio Grande
to protect the virtue of innocents who were delighted to sneak
away to join us and the mestizos in the dry creek bed just 
outside town.

The same as the generals and pols who now hector and
lecture us to deny their seignorial infidelities and cover-ups.

Heads of state, leaders of armies, defenders of law, hah!

Best show in years, watching these pigfesters finger each 
other while seen-it-all Virtue and Justice laugh and crook 
up the next quaverer ashaking.
