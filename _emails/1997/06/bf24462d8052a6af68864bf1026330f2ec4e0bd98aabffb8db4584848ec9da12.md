I always knew you had a bleeding-heard liberal inside, just struggling to

Yes, for some people, this is a police state. But the threat is not (just) 
the FBI/CIA/ATF/NSA; it's us. It's the people developing photos at the
supermarket who aren't comfortable with Hispanics and "ebonites" having
guns, and believe the police or TLAs should put a stop to it. Technical
capabilities don't oppress people; people do.
