Mr Donald asked people to produce victims of child porn production, 
and implied that unless such victims could be found, we should assume
that the whole business was consensual fun. I have provided him with
proof of such victims. (I'm curious to see how he'll respond).

That there was (and for all I know, continues to be) high level
collusion within the Belgium government to hush this up is a side 
issue.

While the perpetrators of these atrocities should be given life
without parole, I say that AP is not the answer. I object to the 
death penalty in all circumstances.
