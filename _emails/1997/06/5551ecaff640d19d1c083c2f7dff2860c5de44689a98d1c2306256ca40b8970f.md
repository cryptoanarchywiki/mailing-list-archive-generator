There is a cuple of mixxed messeges here and I'm going to try to sort them
out.

Do you mean scum bags as in crooks who steal my mail box I pay for without
my permittion to sell me stuff I don't whant?  Then under normal
property laws I should be able to gain reprehence.

Thouse who con naive peaple into giveing them money?

The best wepon against these is an informed and educated public.
Unfortunitly the fact that peaple still post MMF indercates the net-public
still has a sizable number of peaple with inpeard thort proccesses.

Or do you mean thouse who have diffrent sexulial natures to you?

I've met plenty of peaple like this, most of them I would consder postive
contracbutions to the world.

First question kids in general or your kids?

The best and often easyest to implerment is to use the internet with them.
Net(lock nanny ect) type softwere is of debaitable qulity, the main
question with it is "Do you trust a corpration to bring up your child."?

I for one wish I had a consitution that was worth taking an oath to.  But
I would honer it better by reading and understanding it reather then
admiring the cover.

To any complex problem there is always a simple odvice soultion, and that
soultion is wrong.

> Make it like liquor, guns, booze.

But infomation is totaly unlike liquor, guns and booze, for one thing it
moves faster, and for anthougher thing unlike liquor, guns and booze
infomation is a fundermental aspect of the cotinuence of our democries.

> Oops.. for some reason this is a violation of the 1st amendment to!

You seem shocked by this, why.  I can't see how any goverment effort to
control the free flow of information could be seen as anything other then
a violation of your first amdment.

>  Ok, my mistake, its my problem.

You are an adult in a libral democrosy,  you get rights and in exchange
you get problems.

The world is complex, there are no easy answers, there is no one
true way,  there might not even be a soultion to your problem.

That is the whole idear of this list as I understand it, to implerment the
best of the best soultions WRT crypto, priversy ect.  its a grass roots
aproch as good code has a far greater inpact on the net then anything
else.

Death of the internet film at 11?

Please excuse my spelling as I suffer from agraphia see the url in my header. 
Never trust a country with more peaple then sheep.  Buy easter bilbies.
Save the ABC Is $0.08 per day too much to pay?  ex-net.scum and prouud     
I'm sorry but I just don't consider 'because its yukky' a convinceing argument
