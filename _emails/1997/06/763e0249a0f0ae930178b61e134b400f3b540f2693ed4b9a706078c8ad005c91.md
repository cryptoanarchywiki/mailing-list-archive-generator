Possibly.  I have a life.  OTOH, I could lurk for years.

It was a pretty mild insult, relatively speaking, and not really 
aimed at the list in general.

Actually, I was thinking of a news report I read recently about the
nationwide drop in violent crime.  This trend is very widespread, and
is probably explained by the aging of the population -- statistically
it is true that most violent crime is perpetrated by young men in the
throes of a testosterone high.  Similarly, as the list membership
gets older and matures the interest in macho displays diminishes. 

Certainly on this list we see a clique with a strong adolescent macho
fascination with guns and violence, and certain of these individuals
exhibit other signs of stunted emotional growth.  Peter Pan and the
Lost Boys seemed an apt image for this group.

Of course.
