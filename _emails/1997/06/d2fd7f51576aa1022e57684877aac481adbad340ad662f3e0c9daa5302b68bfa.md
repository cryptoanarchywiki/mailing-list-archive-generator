Quit taking the drugs they are affecting your attention span.
You should also quit trying to divine persons motivation, you are terrible
at it.

Actualy I have already named two.

Actualy the Internet II documents that I have seen have specificaly
mentioned letting students at public schools use them as well as people
doing research both private and publicly funded. I understand that it should
start to take physical shape just after the turn of the century.

The High Speed Supercomputer network is also going to be available for use
within just a  couple years as well.

You have obviously missed the entire point, today is not the issue. It is
tomorrow that we should be looking at and the clear indications that Uncle
Sam puts out about funding/supporting future expansion. The federal
government can't afford to keep its fingers out of the pie.

Yes. Yes. First come first served. When the funds run out.

In your opinion, which so far has been nothing but inuendo, ad hominim
arguments, and pure opinion. How about some reasoning to go along with 
it?
