For the Record: Protecting Electronic Health Information 
by:   Committee on Maintaining Privacy and Security in Health Care
Applications of the National Information Infrastructure, National

ISBN 0-309-05697-7; 1997, 288 pages

"...This book makes practical detailed recommendations for technical and
organizational solutions and national-level initiatives. For the Record
describes two major types of privacy and security concerns that stem

technologies for user authentication, access control, and encryption;
obstacles and incentives in the adoption of new technologies; and
mechanisms for training, monitoring, and enforcement...."
