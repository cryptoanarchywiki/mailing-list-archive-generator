The answer to bad laws is not more laws.

There are two separate issues here and it is important to separate the
two:

1) Government mandated ID requirements for Airline Travel.

This is truly evil. It violates several protected rights under the
constitution and is just plain un-american. Who I am and where I go and
how I get there is non of their dam business.

2) Individual Airlines requiring ID as part of there security protocols.

This I have no problems with as it is there planes and they may adopt
whatever security policies they wish. If Delta wishes to require full body
cavity searches before boarding their planes more power to them. No one is
forcing you to fly with them.

There are many things that are forbiden for the Federal Governmnet to do
that are acceptable for individual companies. This is a good example of
just that.
