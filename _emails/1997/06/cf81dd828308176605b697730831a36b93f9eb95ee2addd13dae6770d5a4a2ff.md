But don't they still charge you a penny a minute?  That adds up fast, and
would probably cost you more than your $50 internet access fees.  Plus the
cost of ISDN service...  All told, you're looking at $150 or so per month.

When for $150 you can get a brand spanking new 56K modem, and pay $20-30 a
month.  Not as fast, but a much better price/performance ratio.
