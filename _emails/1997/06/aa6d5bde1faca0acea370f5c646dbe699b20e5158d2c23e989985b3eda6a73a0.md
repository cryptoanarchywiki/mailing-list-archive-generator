Hi Mark,

You really need to modify your mail-processing code as you are going to
see more and more of these. You should also start work on implementing the
PGP/MIME RFC as you will be seeing more of these messages.

Nothing personal but your code should not "break" on any data that is sent
to it. PGP 2.6.x doen't have a problem with these signatures it just
returns a error code and goes on it's way.
