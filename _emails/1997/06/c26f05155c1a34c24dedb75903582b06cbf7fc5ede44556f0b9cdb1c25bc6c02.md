This is a common and well researched technique, which, along with self 
flagellation, can be very effective for moral purification.

I didn`t know the US age of consent was 18? Is this federal or state 
decided? It is 16 in the UK, not that any level is reasonable.

Indeed, prison violence by other prisoners against convicted sex 
offenders (ie. 18 year olds who have sex with their 15 year old 
girlfriend or just happen to accidentally pick up a 15 year old 
at a club, both henious crimes obviously) is very common in the UK.

Yes, the very sight of a naked woman is enough to turn any 17 year old 
into a raving killer with no respect for human life, of course, the 
moment he turns 18 it is just socially looked down upon, but not 
criminal, this is obvious isn`t it? Shouldn`t there be a law!

Yes, libertarian thinking is very pervasive. I used to be a minarchist, 
since thinking about the use of cryptography to preserve stable anarchies 
I have gravitated more and more towards an anarchist point of view with 
just a totally minimal NON-LAWMAKING state, ie. just a properly regulated 
police force, jail system, and the other associated bits and pieces, 
commercial methods, although they would be nice to totally purify 
anarchist doctrine <-(for want of a better and less overloaded word), 
just do not seem to work for these services due to the necessity for 
impartiality, the market DOES NOT want impartial judicial systems...

It does not matter where you are located or who you associate with, or 
who you learn your life-view from, and how it develops. Proper 
logical libertarian thinking always leads to the same views, give or take 
the details.

I would recommend simply keeping all girls indoors in a cave until the 
age of 18, forcing them to wear a cast iron chastity belt, and arranged 
marriages.

Boys can safely be allowed to go out fucking who they like after they 
reach 16, and not a day before, but do not under any circumstances give 
them proper sex education so they do not get girls pregnant, they must 
face the consequences!
