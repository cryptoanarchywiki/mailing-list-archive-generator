That's what happens when you live in places settled by those "Scandahuvians." 
 They're real control freaks.  And they attract other control freaks.

As in what?  Since you can (and always should) refuse to answer cop's 
questions (beyond name, rank and serial number) they can ask all they want

Lying is considered obstruction of justice but silence isn't.
