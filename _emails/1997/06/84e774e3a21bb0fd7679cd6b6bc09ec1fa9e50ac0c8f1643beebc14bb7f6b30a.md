====================================================================

 Although I agree that the U.S flag should not be burned (and yes I am 
also a veteran having served 8 years in the U.S Armed Forces), I can see 
other floks points in allowing the flag to be burned. I will never 
support it, yet since I served to keep the ability to choose a freedom 
that we enjoy, I do not oppose that sentiment. As to the Aussie that 
asked what the "fuck" we Americans give about whether or not our flag is 
burnt obviously does not understand how deep the grain of patriotism 
runs in American blood. It is something anomolous to riding a Harley. If 
we have to explain it to you, you wouldn't understand. In my mind it 
shows how little value the Aussies (or at least this particular one) 
place on their solidarity as a nation and belief in their own country.  
I place a HIGH value on my country and countrymen. (women too :-) )  
That is why I get so upset when I see the degradation that is eating 
this country alive. All the values that made this country as powerful 
and great as it is are slowly being rotted away by some sort of 
malignant cancer that I can not fathom. I understand that The Cleavers 
are a concept that can never truly be lived up to, yet even if we came 
as close as Family Ties, I'd be happy! Some folks say that this is a 
symptom of too much freedom. I am inclined to agree to a certain extent, 
we Americans seem to have lost the ability to control ourselves and 
severely overindulge our whims sometimes. Yet, that is something that we 
have fought long and hard for, losing many a brother, father, sister, 
mother, uncle, aunt, and so on. Let me ask you this? Why are there so 
many individuals from other countries killing themselves to come live 
here, like the Cambodians, Vietnamese, Russians, and such? I'll tell you 
why. Because this country has potential, and strength. What strentgh? 
The strength of it's countrymen. The strength of ideals that are worth 
living and fighting for. Privacy is one of those ideals. That is why 
this channel exists! To unite us together, to try to stop the loss of 
one of the central themes to America. The ability to be private. To 
maintain a sense of individualism not found in many, many parts of the 
world. We stand together for the right to be human! For the right to be 
individuals, not clones! I for one, shall never be a clone. Neither 
government nor fellow human shall force me to bend my knee in deference, 
when that deference has not been earned. The government is trying to do 
that right now. That is why they are trying to take our privacy, if the 
know all that goes on, then control is easier. Whether through fear or 
through willingness, they do not care. They only want control. And we 
can not, should not, and many will not allow that to happen! I have seen 
what happens in countries where total control over their people has been 
achieved. The results are not pretty.  Listen, Look, Learn, Aussie! You 
just might understand!!
