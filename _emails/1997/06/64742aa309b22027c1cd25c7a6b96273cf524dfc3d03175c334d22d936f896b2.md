The CIA has published in the Federal Register today interim
rules and soliciting comments prior to adoption of final rules to
implement its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act, 
the Privacy Act, and Executive Order 12958 provisions relating 
to classification challenges by authorized holders, requests
for mandatory declassification review, and access by historical 
researchers.
