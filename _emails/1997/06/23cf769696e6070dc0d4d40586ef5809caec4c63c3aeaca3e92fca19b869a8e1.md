>From News of the Weird:

* The New York Times reported in December that Odell Sheppard,
a "middle-aged handyman," had just passed his ninth consecutive
year of incarceration in Cook County Jail in Chicago, even though
he has not been charged with a crime.  He was sent to jail for
failing to reveal the whereabouts of his daughter Deborah, who was
the subject of a child-custody dispute between Sheppard and
Deborah's mother, but Sheppard maintains he has no idea where
the girl is.
