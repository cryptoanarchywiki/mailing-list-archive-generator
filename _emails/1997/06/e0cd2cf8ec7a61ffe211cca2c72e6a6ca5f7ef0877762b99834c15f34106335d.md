Hey, hey, hey! None of us who have called it "war" have said it was "the
end of the war."

It's the firing shot in the "hot war," if it passes. The "cold war" has
been underway for more than 4 years.

The CDA was a warning shot, this is the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

They will be sent to meet the fate they have earned.
