I don't understand this.  Of all the alphabet soup privacy groups out
there, EPIC is the one I consider most pro-privacy and anonymity other
than the ACLU itself.  And EPIC knows the tech better, on the whole
(although the ACLU is quite clued-up too).  It is true that EPIC is not
absolutist on SAFE -- and I'm not quite sure that they are right to give
even the inch they gave to get a mile -- but they're awfully good.

Rotenburg should be a near-hero to most readers of this list.  Instead,
canabalism.   Weird.  Very weird.

That does it.  When I get back to the US, I'm sending EPIC a donation.
