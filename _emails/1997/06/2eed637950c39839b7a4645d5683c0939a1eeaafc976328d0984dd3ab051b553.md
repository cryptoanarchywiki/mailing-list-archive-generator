TO ALL PATRIOTS AND OTHER CONCERNED CITIZENS:

Here is an excellent book to read if you haven't read it already.  You can
acquire a copy thru Waldenbooks or Dalton Books or at your library (if they
carry it).  It is called A CALL FOR REVOLUTION---HOW WASHINGTON IS
STRANGLING AMERICA--AND HOW TO STOP IT by Martin L. Gross.  Below is a
brief synopsis of the book.

WE THE PEOPLE ARE ANGRY!
All across the nation, Americans are gasping for breath, waking up to find
the tentacles of Washington wrapped firmly around their necks--and
pocketbooks.  In his NEW YORK TIMES bestseller, THE GOVERNMENT RACKET:
WASHINGTON WASTE FROM A TO Z, Martin L. Gross exposed the wasteful
practices of Washington.  Now, in A CALL FOR REVOLUTION, Gross digs far
beneath that waste to uncover the startling but undeniable truth:  the core
of government is rotten.  WE'RE BEING STRANGLED BY:

*  TAX LAWS THAT DESTROY THE MIDDLE CLASS:  In 1950, a middle-class family
living in Long Island had a total tax burden of 12 percent of its income.
Today, that same family has a tax burden more than three times as much.

*  THE WELFARE PROGRAM, A NATIONAL DISGRACE:  The welfare system costs the
taxpayer more than $300 billion a year -- but if Uncle Sam wrote annual
checks for $14,700 to all 7.7 million poor families, if would cost only
$113 billion a year.

*  THE TWO PARTY DICTATORSHIP:  The Majority Leader (not elected by
voters!) has twenty-six PARTY workers on his staff -- all on the federal
payroll.  The total party tab in Congress is $20 million a year -- all paid
by taxpayers.

*  A POWER-MAD WASHINGTON:  Our cities and states are continually subjected
to unfunded mandates from the government.  Anchorage, Alaska, was forced to
pollute its waste water with fish guts, then treat the organic material in
order to comply with federal regulations.  Washington's rules will cost
that small city -- not Uncle Sam -- $428 million.

*  A BLOATED AND INDIFFERENT CONGRESS:  Congress operates at a price tag of
up to $2.8 billion a year, or some $5 million a member.  What does that get
us?  In 1991, the House passed a $151 billion highway bill -- at a cost of
$2,300 for each family of four -- without ever reading it.

Scathingly honest and crammed with investigative reporting, A CALL FOR
REVOLUTION takes us through the treacherous waters of government, offering
direct ways to correct the corruption, end the inefficiency, and tighten
the belt around the Beltway so that the federal government -- and democracy
- -- can truly be "for the people."

TAKE BACK YOUR GOVERNMENT!

Including the cold, hard facts about Vice President Al Gore's NATIONAL
PERFORMANCE REVIEW.

A CALL FOR REVOLUTION -- HOW WASHINGTON IS STRANGLING AMERICA -- AND HOW TO
STOP IT, by Martin L. Gross

QUOTE:  "This year will go down in history.  For the first time, a
civilized nation has full gun registration.  Our streets will be safer, our
police more efficient, and the world will follow our lead into the future!"
 -- ADOLPH HITLER, 1935

PLEASE NOTE:  Myself, a friend and his contacts at JPFO are currently
researching the above quote for authenticity.  Any leads on said quote will
be greatly appreciated.  Thanks....ASW
