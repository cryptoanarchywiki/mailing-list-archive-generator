Brrrrppppp. Thank you for playing. Your consolation prize is a big whoopie
cushion.

Alaska was not only bombed by a foreign country (ie Japan) but it was the
only continental US location to actualy be invaded. Do a search on Kiska and
Dutch Harbor on Yahoo....

Hawaii was also bombed and last time I checked it was part of the US, the
same goes for Wake Is., Midway Is., and Phillipines.
