NIST has published the 33 comments received on
the proposed Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
intended to replace DES. Several are quite extensive.

In addition to those exemplars we've seen here by 
Bill Stewart and Bruce Schneier, there are remarks by 
several crypto luminaries, such as Ron Rivest and 
Clifford Adams (author of CAST), by NSA, by Canada's 
CSE, and by Certicom, 3Com, TIS, MasterCard, the 
ANSI X9 Standards Committee, the ABA and so on.
