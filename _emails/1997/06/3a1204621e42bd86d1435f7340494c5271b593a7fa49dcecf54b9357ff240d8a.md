[The following post has zero crypto relevance.]

We all have heard much rhetoric concerning the Internet enabling the
creation of niche markets. Markets that wouldn't exist otherwise, since
potential sellers would not be able to reach a sufficient number of
potential buyers to make production of a good profitable.

But how many instances such newly created markets are you aware of? Well, I
discovered a rather sweet example.

You really like M&M's. You know: the round chocolate candy that melt in
your mouth, not in your hand. The only problem is, you don't like the
standard colors. You would much rather have all blue M&M's or, better yet,
a bag containing only teal and light pink. Since the market for teal or
light pink M&M's is marginal, the maker of M&M's does not include these
colors in the bags one can purchase at nearest corner store. What to do?

Voil√†, the Internet to the rescue. Mars, the worldwide candy powerhouse and
manufacturer of M&M's, decided to tap this newly possible business
opportunity by offering custom colored M&M's through their webpage at
http://www.m-ms.com/

A Shockwave applet allows you to combine your favorite colors and order the
candy mix of your choice. Finally, teal M&M's are yours to indulge.

Enjoy,
