So what you're saying is:

                             - Messages - 
           A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Server 1:  1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
Server 2:  0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
Server 3:  1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1


So server 1 sends back the xor of messages A,C,D,F...Z; server 2 sends
back the xor of B,C,E,F,G...etc.  The xor of all of that cancels out
everything except Message Q.  But as long as at least one of the servers
doesn't keep logs then nobody will know that except the person who
downloaded it. 

Clever.  It sure beats reply-blocks.  :)
