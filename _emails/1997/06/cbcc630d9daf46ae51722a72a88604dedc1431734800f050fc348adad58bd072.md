| Could I humbly request that people don't post the new (SHA?) PGP
| signatures to the list for the time being as it's a pain in the ass for
| those of us outside the US who don't yet have the ability to read them.
| PGP 2.6.x error handling doesn't know what to do with them and it breaks
| our mail-processing code.

	Better yet, could PGP release source code so those of us not
lucky enough to own a Mac, Windows, or other supported platform can
move ahead with porting?
