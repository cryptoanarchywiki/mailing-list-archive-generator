Thee BlueList is NOT harassment.  
It's NetWare Quality Assurance.

Check the headers on this, and you'll
see that they are somewhat misleading.

Maybe there's some Mail Transfer Agent
bugs that need fixing.  Or, could it be the
specifications of how this is supposed to
work?

In the future, look for similar tests
of HP SendMail, SGI/SVI, IBM OS/2, etc.
