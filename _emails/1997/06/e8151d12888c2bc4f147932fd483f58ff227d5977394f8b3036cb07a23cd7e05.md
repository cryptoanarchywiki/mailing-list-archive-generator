Dave suggests the key to Netscape's Andreesen's amazing trajectory 
from lab rat gizmoid to market leader, while others languish uncompensated,
at least just yet. 

It's Mark's changeable feature for peeking and tracking, approved by law for 
orderly commerce. "Bugs bounty" is the make light of it charade, while
"bug" is the venerable hardware name.

Find the first few, sure, that's for easy diversion, find those somewhat
deeper, those're for sweeping by the seasoned pros. Then there are those 
that are never found, the ones that always tell what's needed to know in 
national emergency but can never be revealed.

Perhaps any day now MS and NSCP will morph to push browser GAK, 
claiming that public privacy and secure commerce demand protection from 
cyber-terrorists. 

That's the theme, hey, hey, of the Denver meet of global leaders on 
June 20. Could it be that that's what the Silicon chiefs went to DC to plan 
last week while speechifying contrarily to CNN, C-SPAN and Declan.

Surely, though, bountifully trusty PGP is not party to this G-10 globalization 
of crippled crypto, or at least not its Chief Technology Officer, right?

BTW, Declan's spin on national affairs is starting to smell of pontification
to the
masses, classis sign of "if only you knew what I've been let in on."
Shimomuraism,
that, empty data.
