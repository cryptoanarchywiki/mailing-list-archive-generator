Well we're all aware of the 0xDEADBEEF attack, right?  (PGP keyids,
are the 8 hex digit number which PGP recognizes a key by.  The
0xDEADBEEF attack (so christened by Greg Rose one of the people who
independently rediscovered this attack) is where you generate a PGP
key which has the same key id as someone else's key.  This could
confuse a keyserver, or a user into using the wrong key.  This attack
is fairly easy to do, just choose p ending in 0xDEADBEEF (or whatever
the desired key id is), then start with q ending in 0x00000001, and
add some value larger than 0xFFFFFFFF at each iteration doing your
primality test, the p and q will then multiply to have the desired
least significant bits of n).  You may also have noticed that Gary
Howland has a keyid of 0xc001d00d ("cool dude", get it).

Anyway it seems that you can spoof the finger print also indirectly,
which is much less obvious, as the fingerprint is the MD5 hash of the
RSA modulus concatenated with the RSA public exponent.

This was described recently on coderpunks.  (I was forced to eat my
words on coderpunks after declaring this was impossible without an
exploitable flaw in MD5 or brute force of 2**128 bit search space,
when someone explained the concatenation weakness).  I'm not sure who
it was that discovered this attack, or which list/newsgroup this was
announced on, but this was the first I had seen it discussed.

The concatenation is the weakness, as if you have an RSA key of:

n = 0x1234567
e = 0x11

Then you can try n = 0x12345, and e = 0x6711.  So you try factoring
each n of this form, and if it has two factors p and q, then you can
construct a key with the same fingerprint, but with different key.
Anyone who bothers to would be able to factor 0x1234567 also, so it is
not secure, but if you can fool someone into using this key in place
of the real one, you can get their communications.  It will be much
easier to fool someone to use this key as the fingerprint is the same!

Here's an example...

Say we have a 1024 bit key, say e is small ( < 256).  That means
n || e is 129 bytes long.

The e value must be represented by a whole byte.  n can't be smaller
than 384 bits (or PGP will reject it as too small to hold the required
idea message key and padding), so that will give us 80 possible values
for e and n.  Lets use my 1024 bit key for an example.

n = 0x99d61071378ee2c0c8c9c4b7786b203dedf2d6e526f24f7e83f3e0f960fb66b9
      cb81c04e89d70689a4866f21ad1bb5ba6aee51469e5b59b121ba6f3f8d776b62
      7253ba5dc9fca8155a565b9893f695d83a0496eb977ee4659ee20e0f2eb49b25

e = 0x13

So we could try:

e = 0x6713
e = 0x4a6713
e = 0x6a4a6713
...
n = 0x99d61071378ee2c0c8c9c4b7786b203dedf2d6e526f24f7e83f3e0f960fb66b9
      cb81c04e89d70689a4866f21ad1bb5ba
      
e = 0x6aee51469e5b59b121ba6f3f8d776b627253ba5dc9fca8155a565b9893f695d8

      4ae94a5f45e42e3b29c8b89d556a4a6713

Here's the first candidate I found with only two factors starting from
the smallest n value (384 bit n) so that it would be quicker to
factorize (anything that took a long time to factor I moved on to next
value).

n = 0x99D61071378EE2C0C8C9C4B7786B203DEDF2D6E526F24F7E83F3E0F960FB66B9

I'm off to pack this up as a PGP key, to see if PGP likes it!

Well here's that key as a pgp key.  Under no circumstances use it to
encrypt a message you care about.  Here's the public key.

Here are the fingerprints of spoofed key as compared to real key.

Note the identical fingerprints!  (Awesome).

Key id of course is different.

Also note that you can't decrypt directly with PGP, as I suspected,
because the chinese remainder theorem used in decrypt to speed up the
works barfs on small p.  You can hack around that if you're bothered.
It might be possible to find a spoofed fingerprint key with large p
and q, so that this was not a problem.

Below this post is my real key.

This is a major security flaw, and I take my hat off to the guy who
discovered it.

As others noted (who were aware of this flaw) the solution is to
consider the keyid as part of the fingerprint.  That reduces by a
factor of 2^32 the likelihood of the attack succeeding.  I suspect
that rules out the attack working for most keys.  Also be suspicous of
odd sized keys.  Now if someones 2048 bit key has a 1024 bit spoof,
you're in trouble.  I'd be interested in estimates of the likelihood
of this being possible for a randomly selected key.

You could construct a key where the keyid matched, and the fingerprint
matched for two different keys, using a combination of dead beef
attack, and brute force to find a key with the keyid appearing two
places in the key, and then trying to factor the n value at that
point.  Shouldn't take long.

As far as PGP format goes, adding the length field into the digest
would go along way towards fixing it.  (Length fields for pgp big int
representation is big endian 16 bit word representing length of
following big int in bits).

There might still be a small chance of doing the fingerprint spoof
where the length fields both happened to be right.  As you require a
specific length field it would seem this attack would be 2^32 times
less likely to succeed.  This would make most keys safe.  I wonder if
there exists a key out there which would fall to this attack.

(btw for people playing with this stuff, a useful program is
pgpacket.pl by Mark Shoulsen, which displays pgp packets as hex
numbers, see ftp.ox.ac.uk/pgp somewhere under utils).
