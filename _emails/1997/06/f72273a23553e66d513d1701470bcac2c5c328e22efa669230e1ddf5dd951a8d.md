Bellgate or Bill Gates?
   by Declan McCypherpunk

  A wanna-be programmer in this small Canadian town stumbled upon an
undocumented feature in the Netscape browser which allows the user to
place a bet on the date of death of computer magnate Bill Gates.
  While early reports are sketchy, it appears that the scheme involves
Tom Weinstein, Ed McMahon and the cypherpunks remailer system.

  When approached by Kookie Roberts for comment, Tom Weinstein loudly
proclaimed, "I don't even know Jim Bell, honest."
  When Kookie Roberts asked Weinstein who the hell Jim Bell was, he
quickly muttered, "Never mind..."

  Ed McMahon would only say that on September 4th, some lucky winner
would be receiving an anonymous digicash transaction from him.
  When pressed for details about the date, McMahon's face flushed a
bright red and he quickly exited the scene, accompanied by men with
Italian names, and a former CIA PR representative explained that what
McMahon "meant to say" was "no comment."

  Unsubtatiated rumors also indicate that if the netscape.exe file is
printed out as a .gif file, that it pictures a layout of Microsoft
Corporate headquarters and the Gates estate.
  When asked for a response to the announcement of the new revelations
a Microsoft spokesperson cryptically replied, "Anyone who bet on Bill
Gates dying on September 4th ain't gonna win shit." When pressed as to
whether he personally used the Netscape browser, the MS spokesperson
only grinned and winked.
