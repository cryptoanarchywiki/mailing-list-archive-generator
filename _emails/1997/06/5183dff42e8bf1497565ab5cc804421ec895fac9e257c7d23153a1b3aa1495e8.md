  Hetting and Young both pass on a variety of highly informative and
exceedingly normal, reality-based material for the most part. Then,
out of the blue, they post Taoist-Kerouac, acid-flashback missives
which indicate that the Orphan Zombies roaming the computer Nether-
world have not yet managed to steal their souls.
  Since John and Bob's psyche-meanderings often seem to occur within
the same time-frame I have concluded that they both have the same
drug connection.

  So...did you bring enough for everybody?
