You ought to get off this list, then, because you'll surely find our
anarchist, anti-government, tax-evading ideas alien to you.

"Against the law" is not just a nicety of phrasing: it means someone who
"insults a symbol" goes to jail. Hardly consistent with a free society is
it?

As for Bush being a veteran and Clinton not being a veteran, what the hell
does this have to do with their political positions? Did you vote for
George McGovern in 1972 because he was a veteran (a bomber pilot, in fact)
while Richard Nixon was a guy who finagled his way out of joining the
military?

Jeeze, the bozos who wash up on our list. Where's Bell when we really need him?

Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
