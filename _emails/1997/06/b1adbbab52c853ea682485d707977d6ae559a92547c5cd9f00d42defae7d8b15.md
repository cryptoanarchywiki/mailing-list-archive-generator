I'm much more intersted in looking at the motives not of the minority who
voted for ProCODE II, but at who endorsed the final McCain-Kerrey bill and
reported it out of committee.

Keep in mind that civil liberties and business groups across the spectrum
are unanimous in condemning the McCain-Kerrey bill as evil. 

But which senators on the full Commerce Committee voted against it? Did
Ashcroft? Did Burns?
