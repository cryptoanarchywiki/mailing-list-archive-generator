Whew, talk about fixated. NOBODY is talking about stopping anything but you,
THAT would be unconstitutional. I am NOT saying that such a situation would
prevent you from reaching your destination (ie the store) but it would
require you to pass through the picket line (ie get a single page as your
first responce to your request) and be exposed however briefly to their
speech.

You are right, I WOULD  have a right to interfere with their reception which
is after all what I am talking about. I am in no way discussing slowing or
otherwise altering the request from the user, I am specificaly talking about
adding a single page to the servers output. Straw man.

Absolutely, and none of this has anything whatsoever to do with the issue at
hand. Another straw man. If you are using a publicly funded thoroughfare I
CAN consitutionaly FORCE you to see my message if YOU insist on going to
that particular store. It isn't the user who is being picketed, it is the
server. You as a user of the system have nothing to say about it, unless as
alluded by another cpunk you want to picket the picketers (which is
completely legal and happens quite often).
