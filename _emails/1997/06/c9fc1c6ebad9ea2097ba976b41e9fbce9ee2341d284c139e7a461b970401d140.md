Relevant section of AC2 is Table 7.1 (page 153)

The numbers referred to above are slightly out:

In 1995, $1M would give you a machine that would break 56-bit DES in 
an average of 3.5 hours

A $10M machine would break 56-bit DES in an average of 21 minutes

[Double the times for an exhaustive keysearch]
