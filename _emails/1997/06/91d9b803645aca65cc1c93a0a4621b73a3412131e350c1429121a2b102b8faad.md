Thanks, Adam, for sending this along.

As it turns out, I'm working on an article about encryption and privacy
that will appear in Time Magazine next month. Yesterday I photocopied a few
pages of Applied Crypto and printed out the (I believe) February 1996 paper
on recommended key lengths and passed them around the office. Your summary
is even more handy.
