STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION - Antigua & Barbuda
============================================================
Antigua and Barbuda - Consular Information Sheet
 June 9, 1997

Country Description:  Antigua and Barbuda is a developing island 
nation.  Tourism facilities are widely available.

Entry Requirements:  A valid passport or birth certificate and 
picture ID such as a drivers license are required of U.S. citizens 
entering Antigua and Barbuda.  A return ticket is sometimes 
requested.  Immigration officials are strict about getting exact 
information about where visitors are staying.  There is no fee for 
entering the country, but there is a $13.00 departure tax.  For 
further information on entry requirements, travelers can contact the 
Embassy of Antigua and Barbuda, 3216 New Mexico Avenue, N.W., 
Washington, D.C.  20016, telephone (202) 362-5122, or the Consulate 
of Antigua and Barbuda in Miami.

Medical Facilities:  Medical care is limited.  Doctors and 
hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services.  
U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside the U.S.  In some 
cases, supplemental medical insurance with specific overseas 
coverage, including provision for medical evacuation, has proven 
useful.  For additional health information, travelers may contact 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's international 
travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559, Internet:  http://www.cdc.gov/.

Crime Information:  Violent crimes and armed assaults have been 
perpetrated against tourists.  Petty street crime also occurs, and 
valuables left unattended on beaches are subject to theft.

The loss or theft of a U.S. passport overseas should be reported to 
the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  
Retaining a copy of the police report may facilitate return travel 
to the U.S.  A lost or stolen birth certificate and/or driver's 
license generally cannot be replaced outside the U.S.

U.S. citizens can refer to the Department of State's pamphlet "A 
Safe Trip Abroad," which provides useful information on guarding 
valuables and protecting personal security while traveling abroad.  
Both this pamphlet and "Tips for Travelers to the Caribbean" are 
available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government 
printing Office, Washington, D.C.  20402.

Drug Penalties:  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
country in which they are traveling.  Penalties for possession, use 
and trafficking in illegal drugs are strict, and convicted offenders 
can expect lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines.

Aviation Oversight:  As a result of an assessment conducted by the 
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in July 1996, the FAA has 
found the government of Antigua and Barbuda's civil aviation 
authority not to be in compliance with international aviation safety 
standards for oversight of Antigua and Barbuda's air carrier 
operations.  While consultations to correct the deficiencies are 
ongoing, Antigua and Barbuda's carriers are permitted to conduct 
limited operations to the U.S. subject to heightened FAA 
surveillance.  Based on the FAA's determination, the Department of 
Defense does not permit U.S. military personnel to use carriers from 
Antigua and Barbuda for official business except for flights 
originating from or terminating in the U.S., or in extenuating 
circumstances.  For further information, travelers may contact the 
Department of Transportation at 1-(800) 322-7873.

Traffic Safety/Road Conditions:  Driving in Antigua and Barbuda is 
on the left-hand side of the road, as in the United Kingdom.  Roads 
are narrow and in poor condition.  There is relatively little police 
enforcement of traffic regulations.  The condition of the roads and 
the speed at which many persons drive lead to serious traffic 
accidents.  More detailed information on roads and traffic safety 
can be obtained from the Antigua Tourist Board, tel. (268) 462-0480, 
or the Director General of Tourism, tel. (268) 462-1005.

Embassy Location/Registration:  U.S. citizens may register with the 
U.S. Consular Agent, Hospital Hill, English Harbour.  The mailing 
address is c/o U.S. Consular Agent, P.O. Box 664, St. John's, 
Antigua.  The telephone number is (268) 463-6531, Fax (268) 
460-1569, e-mail (no caps) ryderj@candw.ag.  The hours of operation 
are Monday-Friday, 9:00am-4:00pm. (Please call for appointment.)  
U.S. citizens may also contact the Consular Section of the U.S. 
Embassy in Bridgetown, Barbados, which is located in the American 
Life Insurance Company (ALICO) Building, Cheapside, tel. (246) 
431-0225, which has consular jurisdiction over Antigua and Barbuda.  
The hours of operation are Monday-Friday, 8:00am-4:00pm.

 No. 97-098

This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated March 15, 1996 
to include entry requirements information, the CDC Internet address, 
and a section on traffic safety/road conditions.
