TOKYO (June 6, 1997 11:43 a.m. EDT) - Japan, the United States and
European nations will hold an unprecedented ministerial
meeting next month to study ways to restrict obscenity on the Internet
and regulate electronic commerce, it was reported Friday.

The meeting in Bonn July 6-8 will focus on measures to crack down on
obscene and violent pictures on the Internet, Jiji Press
quoted informed sources as saying.

It will also discuss universal criteria for encoding information in
electronic commerce to protect private information, Jiji said.

Japan will be represented by the posts and telecommunications minister,
Hisao Horinouchi, the sources said.
