Oklahoma-am-Rhein: Police Seize Oscar Winner 
12:05 pm 

Oklahoma City police seized copies of
The Tin Drum, the 1979 Academy Award winner
for best foreign film, after a judge ruled the film
obscene under Oklahoma law. On Thursday,
police began removing the movie from video stores
and, using store records, tracking down those who
possessed rented copies. Oklahoma District
Judge Richard Freeman acted on a complaint by
Oklahomans for Children and Families, which was
upset by a scene in which a young boy has oral
sex with a teenage girl.
