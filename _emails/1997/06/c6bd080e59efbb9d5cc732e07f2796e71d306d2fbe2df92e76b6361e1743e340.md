Do you recall the old movie where a couple of mob guys killed a rival 
with a fish (shoved it down his throat and choked him on it)? I think I 
may, if I have some time in the next few days, put together a quick 
website telling people the best fish to use etc. and inciting them to use 
this as a method of assasinating MPs...
