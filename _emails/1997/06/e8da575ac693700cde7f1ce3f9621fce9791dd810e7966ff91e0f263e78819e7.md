Adam Back asked for info crypto export news for AU, IE and NZ,
which I echo. I recall that Peter Gutmann has a standing request 
for crypto export info from anywhere. We'd like to host any reports 
that come in.

For those who've not seen it, his report on his bizarre trials is at:

And a report on a weirdly similar UK experience by Mike Cobb is at:

   http://ukeep.htm

Documenting the various international experiences is a worthy
accompaniment to those of Bernstein, Karn and Junger, and about
the only way to expose global GAK at work. It seems to be 
spreading quietly, implemented case by case, wearing down 
isolated appliants with evasive procrastination, or promising a 
one-time approval, using the clock to threaten pending sales.
