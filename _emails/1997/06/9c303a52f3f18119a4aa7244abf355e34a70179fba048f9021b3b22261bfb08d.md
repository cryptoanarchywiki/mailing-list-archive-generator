If you have been denied a credit card OR you are paying more than 10%  APR on 
                   your credit card, you should take time to read this. 

              YOU COULD QUALIFY FOR A LOW INTEREST CREDIT CARD 
                    WITH NO ANNUAL FEES............AS LOW AS 4.9% APR 

Dear friend,

If you're currently using a high-interest MasterCard or Visa credit card, you could be 
paying an Annual Percentage Rate as much as 19.8%. By transferring the current 
balances from your high-interest rate MasterCard, Visa, Discover or Optima(sm) cards
 to your new low-rate credit card, you can begin saving money immediately. 
For example, *first year savings with a 5.9% APR credit card is : 
_____________________________________________                             
  					               
 If your average   And your current APR is....                       
   balance is....       15.9%             17.4%             19.8%  
                                                                                               
                             you save        you save         you save
