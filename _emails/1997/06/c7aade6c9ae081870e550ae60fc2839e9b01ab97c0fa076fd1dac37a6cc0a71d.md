Sure - it's their means of livelyhood :-)

Now, "fraud" suggests that the onus is on the gumbint to prove that the
claim is false.

However if I were to market "borshch" by mail order as a cure for cancer,
I'd be asked to "prove" in some ridiculous unscientific ways that it does
indeed cure cancer - spending $100M, which only the few large drug companies
can affort - suits them and the FDA just fine.

Troll: and how about them proposed restrictions on tobacco advertising...
