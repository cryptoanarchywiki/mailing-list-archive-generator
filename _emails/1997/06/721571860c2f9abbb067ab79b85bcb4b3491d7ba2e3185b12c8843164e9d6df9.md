This story was stale soon after it hit the "presses." The trial
is on hold as the government looks (in vain?) for expert
witnesses who support their position.

In unrelated news, Reuters is reporting that the head of
CompuServe's operations in Germany, the guy who is being sued in
Munich on kiddie porn charges, is leaving to start his own
company.
