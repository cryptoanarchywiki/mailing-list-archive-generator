  A while back I got a letter from the city asking me to pay a $30
"voluntary fine" for my dog running at large. I replied that I would
take care of the matter when I showed up for my "voluntary" execution.
  A few days ago, a man with a badge and a gun showed up on my doorstep
to explain that if I failed to pay the "voluntary" fine, that a summons
would be issued to require me to go to court and pay a fine.
  I can hardly wait for the city's "voluntary GAK" ordinance.

A. Volunteer
