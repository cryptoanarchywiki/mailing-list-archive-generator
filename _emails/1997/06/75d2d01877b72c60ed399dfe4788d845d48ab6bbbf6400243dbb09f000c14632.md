Though neither Alaska nor Hawaii were states at the time.  Oregon was 
actually hit twice.

June 21, 1942, Fort Stevens at the mouth of the Columbia in Oregon is fired 
upon by the deck gun of a Japanese submarine. The first continental costal 
battery to be attacked by a foreign enemy (not counting those Southerners) 
since the War of 1812.  The Japs fire 17 shells. No apparent damage.  Fort 
Stevens is unable to depress its guns sufficiently to hit the submarine.  A 
draw.

See http://www.ohwy.com/or/f/ftsteven.htm and
http://www.owt.com/phs/classrooms/peto/3forts/stevens.html

Oregon also suffered the U.S. Mainland's only domestic casualties due to 
enemy action when a teacher and members of her family on a hike in southern 
Oregon were killed by a Japanese balloon bomb.  (These bombs were attached to 

balloons released from Japanese submarines off the coast.)

That doesn't excuse Oreganos being commies, however.
