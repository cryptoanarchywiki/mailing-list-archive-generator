Cypherpunks is totally uncensored and there are no rules for posting, you 
won`t get flamed for posting off topic, unless you are censorous, for a 
good short idea of what cypherpunks is all about read Tims "a cypherpunk 
manifesto" or his cyphernomicon.

Raph Levine <sp? There are two, one levine and one levein and I always 
confuse the two) is the remailer god, check out his pages for some 
information.

For anonymous web browsing you need to either direct browsers to go 
through www.anonymizer.com or set up your own similar service.
Once again, Raph`s pages will get you off to a good start.
