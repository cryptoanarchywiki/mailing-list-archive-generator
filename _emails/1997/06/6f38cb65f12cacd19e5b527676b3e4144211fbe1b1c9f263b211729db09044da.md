Key escrow is where your keys are held by one or more trusted and 
supposedly independent third parties, on reciept of a court order they 
would release the keys.
Key recovery is more like the clipper scheme where there was a LEAF (law 
enforcement access field) which allowed the LEA to decrypt communications.

But in the end it all comes down to GAK (government access to keys), same 
shit, different name. Forgive me if this explanation is a little hazy, I 
have a mighty hangover (still only 12:15 sunday morning here).
