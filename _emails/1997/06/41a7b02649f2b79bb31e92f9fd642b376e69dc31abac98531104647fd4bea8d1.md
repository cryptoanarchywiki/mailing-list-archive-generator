I agree EPIC has been one of the better groups, but I personally feel 
none of them can ever do any good: They all sell out in the name of 
compromise.

Also, they seem to have people within them that simply do not understand 
what they are talking about, for example, Marc yesterday commented that 
he would support a law to ban private companies asking for SSNs for 
anything other than tax purposes, this is a clear misunderstanding of the 
nature of private companies and private property.
