Are you serious?  Or are you pulling our leg?

People write crap software.  Microsoft writes crap software.  If the
OS reboots or freezes every time a microsoft app dumps core on you, it
gets tedious.  If you are developing software you don't want a reboot
just 'cause you got a stray pointer.

Real multi-tasking is kind of nice too, like when the mouse cursor
still functions, and your system still runs while copying a file to a
floppy disk.  (The entire system freezes for the duration of the
operation with win3.1, and I think it is still noticeable in win95.
Linux where as you wouldn't know there was a floppy being copied if
you didn't glance down at the drive light.)
