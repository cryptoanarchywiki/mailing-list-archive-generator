Have you set up another userid on the key and resubmit it to the key
servers and avoid the confusion.

Most people out there only know you via your e-mail address.  How do they
know if "tcmay@netcom.com" is the same as "tcmay@got.net" and not
"mallet@nsa.gov"?  When looking for someone's key, most people look by
e-mail address.  (It is the only "unique" id other than key id or
fingerprint that people have to go on.)

What do you want keyservers to go on?  You have to have some way of
obtaing the keys for an individual.  It could be some other Tim May out
there.  (Name collision is pretty common, especially since everyone and
his extended family are getting on the net.)

Uh... Making the key reflect you address so people can find it...  Or as
was said in Dr. Strangelove "It is not a deterent if you keep it a
secret!".
