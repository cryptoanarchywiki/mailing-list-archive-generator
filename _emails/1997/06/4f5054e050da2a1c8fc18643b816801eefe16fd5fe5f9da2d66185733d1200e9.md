Well yes & no. :)

Yes they have the same free speech right as anyone else. Do they have the
right to force anyone to listen to their speech or force them to
distribute it no. They can put up there own web page and if yahoo choses
to they can provide links to it (thouhg yahoo is not required to do so).
Anyone intrested in listening to what they have to say is free to go to
their web site just as anyone is free to go to the abortion site and read
that info. The anti-abortion group should not be required to present the
views of their opposition and the same for the abortion group.

Well down here in Pensacola where we like to shoot abortion doctors I
beleive that there is a 50' seperation (other side of the street). I don't
know how the courts would rule but from past rulling against picketors
interfering with the customers of a business I would tend to dissagree. To
be honest I am not up on which way the wind is blowing in the courts on
this issue.

I do feel that the delay is unconstutional. It is where the fine line
between your and my 1st amendment rights cross. The size and amount of
delay is irrelevant from a constitutional standpoint (can't be a little
bit pregnet can't be a little bit unconstitional).

This is where are disagreement over the picket analogy rest. Inoreder for
the picket analogy to be extended to cyberspace it requires me to download
someone's elses speech before I can download the speech that I want to
hear. In metaspace there is a sidewalk for the picketers to stand and I
can pass them by without slowing down never hearing what they have to say.
Here localy I have them well trained, when they see my vette they know not
to block the driveway as I will not slow down for them (actually the sound
of the 427 is enought to get them moving off to the side).

Never questioned it. :)
