It used to be that mainstream motion pictures were territory
child porn hysterics didn't go near, for fear of losing high
profile cases and creating case law detrimental to their cause.

Yet, as the creeping definition of child porn has moved to
include fully clothed children, and any simulated depiction of
the sexuality of minors, it was inevitable that the child porn
hysterics would finally feel powerful enough turn their crusade
towards award winning motion pictures containing ideas that Bible
thumpers and their ilk would rather not have available to the
masses.

It is therefore no huge surprise that an Ohlahoma Judge has ruled
that the Oscar-winning film "Tin Drum" is obscene, and contains
scenes that constitute child pornography.  Police have seized
videos of the movie from libraries and video stores, and have
gone to the homes of people who rented the film to seize the
tapes.

The Oklahoma ACLU director has called the action "Gestapo-type
tactics" and vows to fight the ruling in court.

Should be Mapplethorpe all over again.
