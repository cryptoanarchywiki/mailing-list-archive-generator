You've completely missed my point.  This would be an on-going problem.
Congress can only function with some idea of compromise in it.  When
you're passing budgets, especially the kind of budgets we have right now,
they get big and complicated, I can't see that changing significantly,
even with a massive turnover of members.  But having no consistency in
Congress at all, even for some "good" reps would be horrible.
