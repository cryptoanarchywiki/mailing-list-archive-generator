Quite, I think we have seen recently that even if these organisations are 
not corrupt, and have the genuine interest of citizens in mind, they 
still end up "playing the game" with the system. It is inevitable for 
them to try to compromise, there can be no compromise.

As soon as fully anonymous digital cash systems are widely available and 
we have moved further along the road to creating censor-proof sites we 
will see the creation of the first AP bot, we all know the outcome.

This is another good point that often gets forgotten, strangely, most 
citizens don`t mind having a red hot poker stuck up their ass as long as 
it has "EFF red poker campaign" printed on the handle.
