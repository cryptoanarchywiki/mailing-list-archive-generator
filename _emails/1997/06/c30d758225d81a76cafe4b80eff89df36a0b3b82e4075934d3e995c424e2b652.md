So's SSE (subsidiary of Siemens-Nixdorf).  But that's mostly/all
defense stuff, so they're presumably in thick with the military
intelligence, and export permission would be a snip for them.

Ireland allows intangible export, no permission required, same as UK.
They do say they would like a list of customers after the fact, but
that's just would like, not you are required to give or else.
(Clearly it would be a bit difficult to list the customers off your
open access web page).

For tangible exports you need permission, much as in the UK.  I get
the impression that the `open for business' attitude (love that 10%
corporate tax break, is systemics getting this?) would mean you'd get
an easier time than in the UK.  They promise fast efficient turn
around on export applications.  (Unlike NZ MFAT, reread Peter
Gutmann's story of down under intrigue on http://jya.com/nsazeal.htm
amazing, nearly bankrupted the company!)

I think it's better than say UK.  But clearly not `no restrictions' at
least for tangible exports re above comments.

I don't know how this works out in practice, what they give tangible
export permission to, etc.
