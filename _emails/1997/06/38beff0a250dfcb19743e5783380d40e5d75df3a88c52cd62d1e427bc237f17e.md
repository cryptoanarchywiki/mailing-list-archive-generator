No more Wacos: What's wrong with federal law enforcement and how to fix it


WHY:	
On April 19, 1993, federal agents conducted a deadly raid on the Branch
Davidian compound 
at Waco, Texas. The Waco raid was the largest raid in the history of the
Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms; it was the largest federal armed entry ever of an
American home; and 
it resulted in the largest number of deaths of law enforcement officers in a
single operation as 
well as the largest number of civilian deaths in a law enforcement
operation. In No More Wacos,
Kopel and Blackman maintain that what happened at Waco was neither a
conspiracy nor a 
fluke. The Waco tragedy instead represents the worst-case scenario of
problems that still plague 
federal law enforcement, including lax procedures involving search warrant
applications and the
militarization of police tactics. The authors will discuss why such
tragedies occur-and how future 
Wacos can be prevented.
