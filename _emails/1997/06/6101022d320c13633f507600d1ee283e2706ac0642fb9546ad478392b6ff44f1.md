One thing that I haven't heard anybody mention yet is that if time is
important, you can break keys in an arbitrarily short period of time,
if there's a continuous sequence of transactions.  Assume it takes 35
hrs to crack a key (with 50% probability), This means that you have a
1.4% chance to crack it in one hour.  If you give up after an hour and
pick a new transaction to crack, you have a 50% chance of cracking at
least one transaction after 48 hours, and they will all have been
cracked in less than an hour.
