           Senate Votes to Block Bomb-Making Info
           by Rebecca Vesely

           12:09pm  20.Jun.97.PDT The Senate has voted 94-0 to tack onto a
           Defense Department spending bill an amendment that would
           prohibit the distribution of bomb-making instructions in the United
           States.

           Although the word "Internet" is not mentioned in the four-page
           amendment, the legislation would outlaw Web sites, newspapers,
           zines, and books that publish instructions on how to make a
           bomb - such as The Anarchist's Cookbook and The Terrorist
           Handbook. Violators would face fines and prison sentences of
           up to 20 years.

           Sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California), who has
           been trying to get the legislation on the books since 1995, the
           amendment passed Thursday is narrowly written to include only
           the distribution of material that has an "intent to harm."
