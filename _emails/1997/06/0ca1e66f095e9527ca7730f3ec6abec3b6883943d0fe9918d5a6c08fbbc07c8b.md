Ah yes.  Well I did read your post on coderpunks where you described
the results of asking Lenstra and looking for ideas for what to break
next, how hard 512 bits was etc.

So... 28,000 MIPs years you say... but that neglects memory.
Lenstra's conclusion was that even 512 bits couldn't be done, from
your post.  So by that measure it is harder (due to memory overhead)
than DES even though theoretically taking less MIPS with 64 mb
workstations.  Also he was unsure about the availability of a large
enough supercomputer to reduce the final matrix.

So any suggestetions of how to summarise the "hardness" of a problem
when it includes memory and cpu costs in as simple terms as possible.
(Bearing in mind the reader in most cases hasn't grasped the
difference between public key crypto and symmetric key, and is
comparing 1024 bit keys to 56 bit keys and probably thinks that it is
1024/56 times harder.)

I think I have his paper as a postscript file, will look.

But what do you think of the extrapolation to todays prices?  $100k?
(Ignoring consultancy fees).

Thanks for the criticisms, more please on readability and
understandability to neophytes!
