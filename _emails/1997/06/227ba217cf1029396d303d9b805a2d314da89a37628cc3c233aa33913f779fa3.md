  Voting is the new Catch-22/Damned if you do, damned if you don't,
etc, etc. It's time for a new non-candidate that is a cross between
Pat Paulsen ("If elected, I will not serve.") and Abby Hoffmean
("Steal This Book.").
  My inclination is for a candidate named "Fuck You!", but I'm sure
someone else can come up with a more creative candidate. 
(Q: "If elected, what will you do for me?" / A: "Fuck You!")

  Of course, in the real world even the use of the minimum force
necessary will probably result in damage to windows in buildings
adjoining the Congressional and Senate buildings.
