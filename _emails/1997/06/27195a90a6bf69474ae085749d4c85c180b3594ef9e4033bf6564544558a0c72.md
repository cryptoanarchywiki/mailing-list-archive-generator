<sigh> If you don't want your children to get blown up don't put them in
harms way. The government *KNEW* that this building was the target of
numerious groups. They especially knew that it was a major risk on that
day. They did nothing to warn the occupants of the building.

This is no different than palcing a daycare center in a munition factory
durring a time of war and then blaming the bomber pilots for blowing up
children.

The Judge of the McVeigh case said himself in his instructions to the jury
that there was no evidence that McVeigh knew of the day care center in the
building. McVeigh was going after the ATF agents in the building (all of
which were conviently gone at the time of the bombing).

A just where were your tears for the children that were burned alive by
the ATF in Waco or the children of Weaver guned down by sinpers at Ruby
Ridge? I guess it only ok to kill children if it's the Federal Government
doing it.
