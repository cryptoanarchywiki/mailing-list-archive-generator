That's one way of putting it ...  :)

Not to mention that the government hasn't owned any of the "backbone 
cables" for many years now. Maybe Jim's on a different 'net.  

I've seen some strange arguements on this list over the years, but this 
one definately ranks. I'm in favor of the right to freedom of speech, 
even for Jim, but he seems to want the right to *force* everyone to 
listen to him *before* being permitted to listen to anyone else.

Seems that Jim wants the *right* to make me listen, not the right to speak.
