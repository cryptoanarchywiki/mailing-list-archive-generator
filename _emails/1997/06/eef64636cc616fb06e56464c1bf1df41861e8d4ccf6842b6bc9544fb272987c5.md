Hi,

We had our business planning meeting tonite and the following was
dediced:

 *    CyberTects will be no more by the end of the week. In its place
      is a new Commercial Web Service firm called (tadah)..

      The Armadillo Group

      There will be specific instructions in a day or so about where to
      send your payments for outstanding service bills.

 *    Update of service fee's:

      Monthly webpage                                 $25.00

      Customer Server Hosting, monthly               $100.00

      SLIP/PPP, dial-in, monthly                      $20.00

      SLIP/PPP, dedicated, monthly, 1 IP             $100.00

      IP Sets, 10 IP's (initial 1 & 9 more), annual  $100.00
 
      Shell access, w/ other account only             $10.00

      Labor charges, hourly, rounded up               $80.00

      Sales Tax NOT included, 8.25% in Texas

 *    We will be focusing on a limited set of services:

      -  expansion of services provided outside the SOHO sector into
         the general business community.

      -  various flavors of dial-in and dedicated connectivity options
         including a move to ISDN availablity with the increase in our
         primary feed to the Internet.

      -  webpage hosting w/ in-house development as required by the
         customer.

      -  hosting of customers servers in-house providing a level of
         technical support previously available only to large
         firms.

 *    The current Real/Time ISDN contract expires at the end of September.
      At this point we plan to have either a T1 or ADSL in place with
      additional servers.

 *    It looks like the current plan is to NOT have onsite service,
      training, and other services available through CyberTects in the
      past propogate through this change over. There will be a clearer
      mailing later in the week better detailing exactly what will be
      available and what we will be dropping.

      Note: Even if the firm as a whole ceases to host mailing lists
            I will continue to host them using my own resources.

            I will continue to do some onsite service and such on my
            own.

 *    The future of the Elgin site expansion to fully mirror SSZ and
      provide 100% backup may not be implimented because of the drop
      of other services. I have not decided if this will be something
      that I take on personaly if it is dropped.


If you have any further questions or would like to express your views on
these changes, please don't send email to me. Instead send it to
'consulting@ssz.com' so that the whole group may discuss the issues.

Our goal as always is to provide you with professional service & support.


                                                  Jim Choate
                                                  The Armadillo Group
                                                  ravage@ssz.com
