Which is why I opposed a distributed crack ever since the crack was first
proposed. But once the crack got underway, the only thing to do was to
participate and hope it wouldn't take all that long. Stressing the
individual that found the key over the group effort was the best thing that
could be done in an already bad situation. Spin control is a fact of life.

Now on to breaking 56 bit RC5 (a waste of time, but until that's out of the
way there will be no sufficient support to break 64 bit RC5).

I am encouraging corporate sponsorships for breaking RC5-64. If we can get
$100,000 together (should be easy), people will find cycles you didn't even
know existed. :-)

  PGP encrypted mail preferred.
  DES is dead! Please join in breaking RC5-56.
