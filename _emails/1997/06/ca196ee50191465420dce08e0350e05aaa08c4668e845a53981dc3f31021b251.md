Hello all,

Well after joining this list a few days ago, i've decided to take the 
plunge and post something. I was looking for feedback on an idea for a 
site. I hope this dosen't violate any rules for posting and i appologise 
if it does. Please dont flame me for my ignorance if i've broken any 
unspecified rules for posting.

Anyway on to my idea. 

I'm a Christian (NO not some religious right looney from the states). My 
idea was to setup a site dedicated to secure and anonymous transmiion of 
data. The appilication being for Christian missionaries in dangerous 
countries, but also as a general purpose site for crypto and anoniminty. 
I was hoping to collect information on setting up anon remailers of 
various types and compiling links and articles for the site. Can anybody 
point me in the right direction ? 

Again i hope i haven't offended anyone or broken any posting rules to 
this forum.
