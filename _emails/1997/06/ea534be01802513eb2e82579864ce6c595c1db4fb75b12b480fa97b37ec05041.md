[Ray, a recent DC law school grad and anti-spam activist, is a good guy
but is IMHO sadly mistaken here. Thought this might be interesting.

As stated before, I have heard no convincing argument that it is in the 
consumers best interest to have an anonymous *vendor*. Sure it's vital 
that *consumers* be allowed to remain anonymous, but if you're selling a 
product or service, there's no legitimate reason why a business needs to 
remain anonymous given issues of warranties, product liability, sales 
taxes, etc.

And in the case above, since the remailer in question is simply acting as 
an agent for the business, there's no question of legitimate anonymity 
implicated. Indeed, perpetuating anonymity for the business often times 
facilitates activites that constitute a breach of contract and sometimes 
even fraud. The whole reason to use a pro-spam anon remailer is so that 
you can violate your ISP usage agreement without being traceable or 
accountable. And if you've entered into that contractual relationship 
with the ISP with the *intent* to breach that contract, it's fraud.

Anonymity for consumers, Yes!  Anonymity for vendors, NO!
