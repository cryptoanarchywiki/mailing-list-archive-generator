Only if the risk is immediate.

Then you've undoubtedly removed yourself from the gene pool ;-)

None that wouldn't adversely impact legitimate activities.

I don't have any problem with sales high-performance autos, or for that
matter possession of substances or machanisms as long as any citizen who
can demonstrate (anonymously) to a regulatory agency that they understand
the use of such items can keep them.

No, but I think those who suggest such restrictions should be forced to
personally fund such research.

Liberty never given its won or taken.

Self-control is too nebulous, for me I prefer responsibility.

Ideas are not protected speech, since they only exist in the mind, only
expressions are protected.  As I stated earlier, all expressions (however
objectionable they may be to some or many members of society) deserve
protection, unless they immediately threaten (or server to incite others to
threaten) the physical well being of specific individuals or groups.  Porn
and instructions for making conventional or weapons of mass distruction
should not be regulated.
