This is not a good idea for ATMs, I have said this many times before: 

At present unauthorised use of someones account involves stealing their 
ATM card and PIN, which is insured against if reported soon anyway. If 
biometric ID becomes commonplace theivery of this kind involves either:

1. Gouging out someones eyeball (would this actually work or would the 
damage done to the eye render it useless?)

Or, more likely:

2. Kidnapping the account holder and forcing them to ID themselves at 
gunpoint/knifepoint.


I would sure as hell rather have the inconvenience of going home and 
calling the CC company to report a stolen card, than be kidnapped and 
possible harmed for a few $.
