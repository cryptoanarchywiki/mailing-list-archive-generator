                The Digital Commerce Society of Boston

                              Presents

                             Win Treese
                          Open Market, Inc.

      "Security Standards, Policy, and Projects: A Personal View"



                        Tuesday, July 1, 1997
                              12 - 2 PM
                  The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
                    One Federal Street, Boston, MA
                   Price, Including Luncheon: $30.00


In this talk, Win will discuss three areas of recent work related
to security:

1. History, status, and future of the Transport Layer Security
    Working Group of the IETF. This working group has been
    moving SSL into an Internet Standard.
2. Experiences with gaining approval for exporting Internet
    commerce products with strong cryptography.
3. History, status, and future of the Secure Electronic Transactions
    protocol, from the point of view of a developer of Internet
    commerce products.

Win Treese is Director of Security at Open Market, which provides products
and services for Internet commerce. He has been with the company since it
began operation in 1994, working primarily on the security and payment
architecture across its product line. He also chairs the Transport Layer
Security Working Group of of the IETF. Prior to joining Open Market, he was
with the Cambridge Research Lab of Digital Equipment Corporation. He also
served as Chief Systems Engineer at MIT's Project Athena.


This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held on
Tuesday, July 1, 1997, from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of the
Harvard Club of Boston, on One Federal Street. The price for lunch is
$30.00. This price includes lunch, room rental, various A/V hardware, and
the speaker's lunch. ;-).  The Harvard Club *does* have dress code: jackets
and ties for men (and no sneakers or jeans), and "appropriate business
attire" (whatever that means), for women.  Fair warning: since we purchase
these luncheons in advance, we will be unable to refund the price of your
lunch if the Club finds you in violation of the dress code.

We will attempt to record this meeting and put it on the web in RealAudio
format at some future date

We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or, if we *really*
know you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by
Saturday, June 28, or you won't be on the list for lunch.  Checks
payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will have to be
sent back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The Harvard
Club of Boston", in the amount of $30.00.

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've
had to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for instance),
please let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something
out.

Upcoming speakers for DCSB are:

August    Duncan Frissell      MarketEarth
September Christof Paar        Elliptic Curve Cryptography
October   Peter Cassidy        Military Fiat and Digital Commerce
November  Carl Ellison         Identity and Certification for Electronic
                                Commerce

We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on
the first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a
presentation to the Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program
Commmittee, care of Robert Hettinga, <mailto: rah@shipwright.com> .
