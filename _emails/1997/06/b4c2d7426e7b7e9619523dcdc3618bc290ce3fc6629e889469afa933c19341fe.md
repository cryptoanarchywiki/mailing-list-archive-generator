	This and cameras disguised as Cable TV amplifiers are very
common means of diguising federal video surveillance gear.  Most
people don't know enough about what is on the wires and poles near
them to tell the difference, which is often subtle but obvious to
someone technically trained - things like pole pig transformers
that have no HV connection to the distribution wires...  or cable
line amplifiers not actually connected to a cable trunk line or
of a different type than the rest of the system.   Closer examination
will often disclose a little window with a lens behind it, which
of course is uncommon on regular pole pigs...

	Most of this gear transmits FM NTSC video signals in various
standard microwave bands (1.7 ghz 2.2 ghz 2.4, 5.3 ghz etc) used for much
federal bugging.   No attempt is usually made to scramble the 
signal, so if you have the right microwave receivers (some European
satellite receivers cover this band for example), you too can watch
some mafia don go into and out of his house....  TV stations have
occasionally  discovered these signals on their remote pickup
antennas for live newsfeeds from remote trucks - many of these operate
nearby in frequency from tall buildings or TV towers with huge line
of sight coverage and bored techs sometimes tune up and down the
band to see what they find ....

	I have actually seen one of the fake Cable TV amplifier
bugs for sale at the Dayton Ham flea market.  I didn't buy it,
but it was an interesting curio.
