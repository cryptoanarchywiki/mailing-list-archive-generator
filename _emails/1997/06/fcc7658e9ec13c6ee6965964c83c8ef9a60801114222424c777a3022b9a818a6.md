What is the problem from a non-parent (by choice) point of view?  
Simple: control your fucking kids!  That's the number one problem in 
the USofA today.  Parents let their fucking kids run wild.  Mom 
works, Dad works, Kids are free all day to cause trouble, and send 
spam.

Spam is free speech!
