Its more like poor innocent workers and kids who are just more 
victims of the insanity initiated by the Scott, Weaver and Waco 
murders.  Brought to you by the good government of holy statist
religion.

None of those criminals have been tried, much less convicted.

My favorite quote from the Scott murder (I believe it was from the
local prosecuting attorney).

"...well they just lost their moral compass"

And so did McVeigh.

Irrelevant.
 
> Tim McVeigh certainly acted for the right reasons.

He acted for reasons that had nothing to do with murdering innocents.
I guess this was his US Army training in the Gulf.  I think it was an 
act of cowardice.  If you have a grudge with some US officials and 
you think you will be the avenging angel it takes much more courage 
to attack them personally than to blow up a building.

But if we're talking relative evils then at least his motives were not
to plunder someone's land, to run live stormtrooper excercises
against a church or to collect a paycheck for assasinating a mother (baby 
in arms) from a safe distance.

The only thing I think he should have been convicted of is 
conspiracy.  The rest of the so-called evidence is pretty flimsy and
never actually locates him at the scene of the crime.  Of course
conspiracy in an act like that should probably get you life.

Hmmm.  Well just in case anyone has forgotten, McVeigh was ratted out
by the Michigan Militia when he went to one (1) of their meetings.  
This happened because he tried to sell them the idea of 
blowing up federal buildings.   The MM called the FBI, which admitted 
it.  I guess the Feds thought..."oh, just another wacko wanting to blow 
up federal buildings.  We'll get to him later.  Right now we have 
more important things to attend to - like covering up Waco."

Cool.  Lets set up an excellent strawman to knock down.  How come 
whenever HB (and other socialist/statists) talk about the opposite of 
statism they always talk about NAZI's.  (remember National 
>Socialist's<).  Oh, fascism is another favorite label.  Fascism is 
from the Latin "fascia" - - to bind together.  Politically fascism is 
the melding together of state and corporate interests until each
serve each other well.  Maybe we can identify fascism on the
American scene.  CNN lapdogs reporting Waco "news" directly from
the FBI's on-site mouthpiece.  Other big-time media keeping their
respectful 3 miles from the Davidians' religious community.  (not 
compound, not cult).  Whatever happened to the reporter in the field 
from the Vietnam war days?  What about AP filtering out the DEA siezure 
of a military cargo aircraft importing 1 ton of cocaine into Alameda 
naval airstation?  What about 60 minutes' analysis of the infrared 
footage where the ATF was mowing down citizens fleeing the Waco 
barbecue?  Their experts told them that murder was being committed.
Nothing on TV.

...that's fascism.

(sung to the tune of That's Entertainment)

See above.  The MM rejected him, but the FBI thought he was harmless.

End game.  McVeigh guilty of whatever.  They are probably right.  
What I'm more interested in is the nest of viper's behind the man.
Since we're invoking WWII Nazi history, can anyone say,
"burning of the Reichstaag"
