THAT, my friend, just ended ANY chance of coomunication between the two 
of us. When you start thinking you are better than someone else, you 
have stepped over the line.  BTW, the spelling for dood is D U D E! 
Learn to spell before you start thinking you're better than anyone else. 
Baby steps, baby steps! And as to the imperialist comment. Give it a 
rest, folks have been saying that for years. Ever heard of dancing to 
your OWN beat. Give the badwagon some room. Too many on it as it is now. 
And as for me getting a life. I have one. I live in America! :-)

===========================================================
Though referenced by it's government, a country is defined 
by it's people. For it is not it's government that makes a 
country, but it's people. The government is just a place to 
put the useless. :-)   God does have a sense of humor.... 
He forgave our sins, and gave us government for penance!
