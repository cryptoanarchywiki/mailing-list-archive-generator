Wavy Gravy has occasionally run a "Nobody For President" campaign.
"Who'd be the best President?"		"Nobody!"
"Who's going to balance the budget?"	"Nobody!"
"Who's going to fix the schools?"		"Nobody!"
"Who can you trust with the Bomb?"		"Nobody!"
"Which candidate cares about the poor?"	"Nobody!"

A few years back, the Libertarian Party was trying to get
on the ballot in Washington State by running a governor campaign.
They didn't make it, because they lost the protest votes to
a candidate who changed his name to "Absolutely Nobody".
Absolutely Nobody got about 7% of the vote.

(The unfortunate followup story later ran in the SF Chron 
under the title "Absolutely Nobody died today"; he was in
politics because he was an AIDS activist, and had the disease.)

During the '92 elections, I was considering getting 
Frank Zappa on the ballot in New Jersey.  He'd already dropped
out of the race due to his cancer, but it only takes 1000 signatures there,
which would have been an afternoon's work at Rutgers.
He's dead now, but he probably would enjoy running anyway :-)
