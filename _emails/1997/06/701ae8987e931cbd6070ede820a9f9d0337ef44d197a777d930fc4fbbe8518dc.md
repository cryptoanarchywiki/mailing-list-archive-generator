 I couldn't help but notice from the TV reports that Lisa Bonet
Ramsey was a pretty hot little number. Has Peter Jennings been 
arrested yet for his part in the national media helping to spread
child pornography? Kookie Roberts?
 What if I send the FBI a picture of myself pulling my pud while
watching young Lisa strutting her stuff on the ten o'clock news?
Will the newscasters be imprisoned for conspiracy in my thought
crime?

 Mother Nature was undoubtably a co-conspirator in your criminal
thoughts. If you had been charged you probably could have eased 
your sentence by ratting her out.
