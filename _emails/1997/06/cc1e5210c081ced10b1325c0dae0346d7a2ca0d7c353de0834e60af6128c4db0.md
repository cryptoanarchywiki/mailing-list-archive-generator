NEW ON THE NET.

Wouldn't you have liked to have been part of the first group to join Amway in the 60s, or purchased stock from a small company called Wal-Mart in the 70s, or invested in a small computer chip maker called Intel in the 80s.

Anybody that made the choices above are sitting pretty well at the moment
Here in the 90s, a new company was launched on the Internet, Sunday June 1st  This young company has positioned itself to be among the major players for years to come.

This is NOT a get rich quick scheme.
This is simply a new company, with fresh ideas.  A a new company that people
are going to hear a lot about.

Please put the words "MORE INFO" in the subject field.  You will be sent
complete info in seconds
