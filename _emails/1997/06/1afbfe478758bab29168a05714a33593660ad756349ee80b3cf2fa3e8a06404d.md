___________________________________________________________________________

               *** RALLY AGAINST INTERNET CENSORSHIP ***

     ** Supreme Court Decision on CDA Expected Wednesday or Thursday **


AMENDMENT I: "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble."


               *** RALLY AGAINST INTERNET CENSORSHIP ***

          ** South Park, San Francisco, California -- 1 PM **

___________________________________________________________________________

In February 1996, President Clinton made Internet censorship the law of the
land by signing the Communications Decency Act.  The CDA -- a blatant
affront to free speech -- has since become a symbol of the ignorance and
contempt the American political establishment reserves for Internet users
and their constitutional rights.

Now, more than one year later, the United States Supreme Court is poised to
decide the fate of free speech for the 21st century.

On Wednesday or Thursday of this week, the Supreme Court will issue a
decision in the landmark case of ACLU vs. Reno.

On the day the decision comes down, The Electronic Frontier Foundation,
Wired Ventures, and the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition invite you
to join us for a RALLY to show your support for free speech online.

PLEASE JOIN US to discuss the free speech implications of this ruling with
plaintiffs and organizers of the legal challenge.

___________________________________________________________________________

WHEN: On the day the Supreme Court issues its decision.

EITHER.... Wednesday June 25, 1997 *OR* Thursday June 26, 1997 at 1 PM

For up-to-the-minute information on the status of the decision, please
visit http://www.ciec.org

WHERE: South Park (between 2nd and 3rd, Bryant St. and Brannan St.) San
Francisco.

SPEAKERS (Tentative List):
Bruce Ennis, the lead attorney who argued this case before the Supremes
Mike Godwin, Electronic Freedom Foundation
Judith Krug, American Library Association
Sameer Parekh, C2Net
Todd Lappin - Wired Magazine

BRING: Attention-grabbing posters, signs, and banners that demonstrate
your committment to free speech and expression, and your feelings
about Congress.
