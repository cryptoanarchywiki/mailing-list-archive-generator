 JUST A RECAP OF HOW OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS
 
 The LAPD, The FBI, and the CIA are all trying to prove that they are 
 the best at apprehending criminals. The President decides to give them 
 a test.  He releases a rabbit into a forest and each of them has to 
  catch it.
 
 The CIA goes in. They place animal informants throughout the forest. 
 They question all plant and mineral witnesses. After three months of 
 extensive investigations they conclude that rabbits do not exist.
 
 The FBI goes in. After two weeks with no leads they burn the forest, 
 killing everything in it, including the rabbit, and make no apologies. 
 The rabbit had it coming.
 
 The LAPD goes in. They come out two hours later with a badly beaten 
 bear.  The bear is yelling: "Okay! Okay! I'm a rabbit! I'm a rabbit!
 
 Case closed.
