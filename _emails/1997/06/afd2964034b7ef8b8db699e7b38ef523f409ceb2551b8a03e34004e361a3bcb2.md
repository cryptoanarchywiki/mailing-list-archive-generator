     "If we don't believe in freedom of expression 
      for people we despise, we don't believe in 
      it at all." - Noam Chomsky

     "We are willing enough to praise freedom when she 
      is safely tucked away in the past and cannot be 
      a nuisance. In the present, amidst dangers whose 
      outcome we cannot foresee, we get nervous about 
      her, and admit censorship." - E. M. Forster

     "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend 
      to the death your right to say it." - Voltaire


The question that needs to be asked is, what does that flag represent that 
is being burned?  Does it represent the constitutional republic and respect 
for individual liberty that America was founded upon?  Or does it represent 
the socialist democracy and the arbitrary herd mentality view of "freedom" 
into which America has devolved?

If the latter, then pass me the gasoline and the matches.

An American
