Had you kept that 20 dollars in a high interest long term access account 
or invested it in stocks it may now have been worth enough to convice you 
to give him the said blow-job. ;-)....

Very well put, I often use a variant of this as a counter argument to the 
child protection censorship brigade. If parents bring up kids such that a 
picture of a cow being sucked off is going to turn them into a 
bestialist, or a picture of a dead guy is going to turn them into a hard 
as nails killing machine praying for death, the child is pretty fucked up 
in the first place.
