If you set up your mailbox to accept e-mail promiscuously from anyone,
then anything sent to it is "consentual".

The onus is on the recipient to filter out what they don't want (or to
"filter in" only what they want, which is how I think we'll end up). Such
filtering takes less time+effort than "repeated cease-and-desist notes".
