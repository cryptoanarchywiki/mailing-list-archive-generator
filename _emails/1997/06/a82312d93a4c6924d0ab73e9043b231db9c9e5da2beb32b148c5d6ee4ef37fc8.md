I am expecting Tim McVeigh to show up in a video game any day now.  Check
out some of the games at the local arcade.  See who the villians in the
"shoot-em-up" games are...  Used to be "drug dealers".  Now it is
"terrorists".  And you get to be the one to "blow the badguys away".  (In
my more paranoid moments I equate it to a plot to get people to side with
the government on the next televised shoot-the-bad-guys
spectacle/stand-off.)  In one, you get to go after them in a hellicopter!
(Painted black, no doubt...)

And you don't see any mothers protesting what this will do to their
kids...

Will the next video game target be evil cryptographers?
