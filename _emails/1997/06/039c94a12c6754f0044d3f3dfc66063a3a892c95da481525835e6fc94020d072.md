We're talking here about governments where unlicensed crypto is a crime.  Or 
other countries where anonymity is illegal.  Give me a break.

And EPIC (nee CPSR) and CD&T are run by Left pro-government types who like
big 
governments and high taxes.  So we're even.

So are they going to give up their street cameras, address registration (in 
Belgium, you can't get the gas service turned on in your flat if you haven't 
registered with the commune -- but you can get electricity), occupational 
licensure (of *all* occupations as in Germany), national ID cards, Financial 
Police (Italy), computer registration, piles of mandatory paperwork, etc.?

They could just repeal their privacy invading laws and regs.  No new 
technology needed.

And with modern technology, we turn right around and make decisions on the
rights of governments.

Then why do Europeans have *much* less privacy than Americans.  Tiny
example.  
In much of Europe, if mail coming to your flat is not addressed to the name
on 
the mailbox, it doesn't get delivered.  In the U.S., the P.O. still tends to 
deliver as addressed and let the occupants sort it out.  Somewhat looser.
