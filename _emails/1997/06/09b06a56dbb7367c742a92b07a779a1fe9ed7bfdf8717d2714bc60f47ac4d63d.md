And, of course, the penultimate solution to the *whole* problem is cash
payment for every video feed. :-).

In addition, if the government was out of the copyright/patent
monopoly-granting business (for some reason ;-)), you could even
re-distribute these things with recursive auctions. The person who has
posession of a whole MPEG file copy then has more incentive to just resell
his copy, again for cash, and probably for multiple times, than to give it
away and not get even some of his money back.
