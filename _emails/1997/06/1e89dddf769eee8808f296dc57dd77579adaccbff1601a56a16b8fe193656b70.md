And this is the third, and hopefully final for now, article forwarded from
that sublist discussion this morning. As before, the comments of the other
person are paraphrased.

My final comment. I am tempted to write up a long article analyzing how the
Cypherpunks list has changed over the past 5 years, and who has been on it
and off it. Maybe later.

Suffice it to say for now that many people have been on the list, and then
dropped off. For lots of reasons. And their reasons are not something I
feel I need to worry about. They'll do what they want to do. Some graduated
from school, some got crypto jobs, some decided they'd had enough, some
agreed with the basic views but were ready to move on, some despised our
basic outlook, some were told by their employers their subversive
activities were a career impediment, some disliked the yahoos and lunatics,
some wanted censorship and left when they didn't get it, some never
bothered to resubscribe after being dropped for one reason or another, and
so on.

Life goes on. I don't worry that we "lost" Peter Wayner, or that we "lost"
David Sternlight, and so on. Life goes on.
