Theoretically they will replace old currency with new currency if they can
recover 75% or some such high value of the surface area.  Carefully cut
out the serial numbers and burn only them, then turn the damaged bills
back in for replacement (or give them away for someone else to do - I
think it is another one of those felonies to intentionally deface
currency).

You could also derive a number from the absolute time and location of the
issuer with a GPS device.
