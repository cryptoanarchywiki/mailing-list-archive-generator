not to encourage any paranoia or conspiracy theory, but 
this is an interesting warning I saw on another mailing list that I thought
I'd pass on---

I am writing this to WARN THE PUBLIC of a very DIABOLICAL SCHEME that
is RIGHT NOW playing out in the market and ingeniously designed to separate 
GULLIBLE INVESTORS from their lawful returns. I cannot now reveal 
exactly the name of the company involved, but I will identify it by the 
initials "FRN". 

FRN directors are involved in a complex STOCK MANIPULATION SCHEME
in which they are selling additional shares of the company beyond
those in circulation, with only the hazy knowledge of the existing
stockholders. This is being done IN COLLUSION WITH GOVERNMENT
REGULATORS, who are receiving kickbacks from the operation! In other words, 
individual investors of FRN believe they own 1/n of the company, when in 
fact there are more shares in existence and they actually own far less than 
the fraction indicated on their certificates!

The additional shares are owned by directors of the company who
are secretly releasing the FRAUDULENT SHARES on the market with PRECISE 
TIMING, such that whenever the legitimate value of the company increases,
they release new shares for sale at the current share price. The
net effect is that market share prices creep up in value only marginally 
while the directors effectively INCREASE THEIR CONTROL of the corporation 
by STEALING FROM SMALLER SHAREHOLDERS. 

Some select shareholders are allowed to participate in the plan if they
increase the profitability of the company, but in their BLIND GREED have 
not done the math and do not realize that they are in effect LOSING MONEY 
even though numerically their supposed shares are compounding regularly! 
In effect the corporation is COUNTERFEITING ITS OWN SHARES under the full 
knowledge and supervision of the topmost echelons, and the general
ignorance of shareholders! This thievery is paid for courtesy of an 
ever-increasing percentage of the company's shareholders without
their awareness! 

In fact, because so many shareholders are participating, the whole
system can be thought of as a massive form of INVISIBLE SLAVERY! 
The energy of the shareholders that is successfully improving the
company is being siphoned off by their "masters", while the masters
insist that the company is not even breaking even!  Perhaps you may scoff, 
but remember, THE PERFECT SLAVE IS THE ONE WHO DOESN'T REALIZE HE'S A 
SLAVE, and an even better one RIDICULES THE POSSIBILITY. And--some 
slaves THINK THEY ARE MASTERS when in fact they are really SLAVES.
(Do you live in a "land of the free"? Are you sure?)

FRN has been operating since 1913 and has sucked in huge masses of
unsuspecting shareholders who do not realize that it is a massive pyramid
scheme that must eventually collapse! Initially the effects were negligible
but the disparities among shareholdings has been magnified exponentially
over the years.  Shareholders have not realized this EVIL TRICK 
because the company has been growing incredibly rapidly
with massive profits that are never reaped by the DESIGNATED
VICTIM SHAREHOLDERS but instead skimmed by the CONSPIRATOR'S ELITE.
A sophisticated and well-funded PR Office of the company has hypnotized
the shareholders into believing their shares are far more valuable than
they really are, even in spite of OBVIOUS SIGNS OF DEPRECIATION!

The grotesque nature of the beast is revealed in that eventually, 
with mathematical certainty, doing absolutely nothing, the SINGLE SHAREHOLDER 
who owned the greatest share at the beginning of this hoax will eventually 
OWN VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE COMPANY, with all other shareholders owning 
virtually nothing! ("The rich get richer and the poor get poorer"-- with
some of the poorer thinking they are getting richer!) But the system will 
collapse before then after enough shareholders FEEL THE SQUEEZE.

Unfortunately, it is likely the shareholders will only realize they have 
been CHEATED and get ANGRY once the whole snake oil enterprise
CRASHES! At that point, whoever will be left holding the bag will be 
mostly random!  But what about the masters?

Hopefully when the pyramid scheme FINALLY DOES CRASH, the shareholders
will have learned their lesson, and go after those truly responsible 
instead of fighting among themselves, or at the very minimum
STOP INVESTING IN PYRAMID SCHEMES! However, history has suggested 
that the current FRN owners have been using the same strategy in 
many prior shell games and escaped many previous company "bankruptcies" 
with their wealth unscathed, and are right now shrewdly planning their 
escape route by cashing out at precisely the right instant
in their LATEST AND MOST GREATEST SKULLDUGGERY EPISODE as well! 

>From what I have heard, the plan is to then use the proceeds 
to erect the next, EVEN MORE CONSTRICTING WEALTH EXTRACTION 
AND SLAVERY SYSTEM. They have been doing this LIKE CLOCKWORK 
on a schedule of about every 60-70 years, which seems
to be about the limit of the public's memory and the lifespan of
the system. In fact, it has been going on so long the masters
have convinced the population that it's a regular and
unavoidable phenomenon!

I don't know what will happen, but I am sending this warning to
YOU PERSONALLY to check to see if you own shares in FRN, and if
so, SELL THEM IMMEDIATELY and invest your hard-earned money into
some LEGITIMATE ALTERNATIVE that doesn't steal from you merely by
owning it. Also realize that TRADING FRN SHARES, while convenient, is
PLAYING INTO THE SCAM! Quite insidiously, far more people own and
trade shares in FRN than realize it due to indirect ownership!
The MASS DELUSION is everywhere!

Eventually the corruption in the government and greed in the population
will have to be cleaned up so that companies such as FRN can never
begin operating in the first place, and THE TEMPLE IS FOREVER RID OF 
THE MONEYCHANGERS. But your FIRST DEFENSE is your own intelligence. 
Remember, YOU CAN'T CHEAT AN HONEST PERSON!

Part of the moral is to KNOW WHERE ALL THE SHARES ARE and to MAKE SURE 
THEY ADD UP TO 1!  The TREACHEROUS HIGHWAY ROBBERS will invent elaborate,
complicated, INCOMPREHENSIBLE reasons why they don't, such as talking about
what paper the stock certificates are made out of, or how high government 
taxes are, or pointing at programs for share-trading among shareholders. But
remember, this is all SMOKE AND MIRRORS--a certificate that says 1/n is
a CONTRACT no matter what kind of paper it is printed on, the entire 
government recently became ANOTHER LOSING SHAREHOLDER, and the net result
of the share-trades NEVER ESCAPES THE SHARE PARASITES! 

Please don't attack the losing shareholders! If you have problems 
identifying the thieves, remember, THEY'RE THE ONES WHO AUTHORIZED
RELEASE OF THE FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATES in the first place, IN EXCESS OF 
FACE VALUE. And they'll likely be unscathed after the collapse, but keeping
an extremely low profile! (But don't blame the printers! And don't believe 
it if the "authorizers" pretend to be the "printers"!)
 
Take back your power and DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY, otherwise, you're just 
ANOTHER VICTIM FOR THE CON GAME! 


May God be with you--
