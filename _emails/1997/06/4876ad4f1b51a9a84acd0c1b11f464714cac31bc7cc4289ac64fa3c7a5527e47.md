  Someone needs to write an email filter that saves the headers from
the TruthMonger (et al) posts and deletes the message. (A similar case
could be made for mute Playboy centerfold candidates.)

X-Comments:  This email message is not from "Lee Harvey McVeigh': it was
X-Comments: sent by an anonymous asshole using a remailer.
X-Comments:  Send all complaints about abuse of this remailer to
X-Comments: the Oklahoma City Federal Building in a Ryder truck.
