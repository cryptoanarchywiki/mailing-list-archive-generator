They did what they did because they thought it was in their interests; 
otherwise they wouldn't have done it. We owe them nothing, and I am 
horrified to see this phrase. How much do you owe a parasite that tries 
to negotiate with other parasites to take slightly less of your blood 
than they originally expected?

Statements similar to yours have been made so many times, scolding
"extremists" for "not being realistic." I seem to remember something about
extremism in defense of liberty being no vice, and moderation no virtue.
Either way, if you compromise, you don't get what you want. That is
absolutely obvious. So why compromise?
