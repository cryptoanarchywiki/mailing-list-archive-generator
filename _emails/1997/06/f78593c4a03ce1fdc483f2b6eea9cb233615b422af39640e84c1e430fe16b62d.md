Hi all-

	Here is Andy Dustbin's replacement for the dustbin remailer, one
which was quite reliable during the time it was up. Add this one to your
lists. You can get the keys from the remailer.

	The good news is Andy intends to eatablish another nym remailer. We
need more of these.

	Fred

	Although in theory, there's no difference between 
	theory and practice, in practice, there is.

Dustbin is dead; long live Cracker! ("Cracker" means more than you think;
get out your dictionaries and look up the term as it applies to the SE US,
or specifically GA. ;)

Here is the vital data:

$remailer{"cracker"} = "<remailer@anon.efga.org> cpunk pgp hash latent cut
ek mix reord middle";

Cracker runs ghio-2 and Mixmaster 2.0.4b1. You may notice an extra key
stashed in here. It is for the forthcoming nymserver (which I am having a
nasty problem with PGPPATH, ARGH!). Don't use it yet; I hopefully will
make the announcement tommorrow.
