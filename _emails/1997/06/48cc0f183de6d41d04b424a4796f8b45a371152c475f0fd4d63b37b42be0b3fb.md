Strong crypto you must remember is only part of the solution. The reason 
for the lack of direct response from the Jews during the holocaust was 
the "legally elected" 3rd Reichs programme of disarming it`s citizens.

Strong crypto along with other communication technologies provide a 
strong and secure framework within which armed resistance can take place, 
these same technologies also allow for infowarfare type attacks on the 
infrastructure of whole countries or jurisdictions.

Well, tax money already does purchase toys for the rulers and the 
jackboots are moving towards our throats slowly so no-one notices. Safety 
and wealth derive from free market economies and rights to self-defence, 
not from a government.

For once we agree, CACK (corporate access to corporate keys) is a service 
that is in demand, and will be more in demand in future. I see no reason 
for this to involve any government or be a regulated market, a 
competitive corporate escrow market is the best way to go.
