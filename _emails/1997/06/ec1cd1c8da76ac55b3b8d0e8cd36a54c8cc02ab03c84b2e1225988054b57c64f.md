This week the award-winning Shift Control presents...

The Design Issue

David Carson, former surfing pro turned international advertising 
consultant, is one of the most influential and instantly recognisable 
graphic designers of his generation. Edo van Duyn talks to him in a 
Shift Control exclusive.

The Royal College of Art's Industrial Design Engineering course has 
over the years moulded some of Britain's greatest creative talents - 
including the inventor of the Dual Cyclone vacuum, James Dyson. Shift 
Control talks to some of this year's graduates to discover the gadgets 
and gizmos of tomorrow.

And Andrew Byrom presents a guide to contemporary typography - the 
ubiquitous, ephemeral and disposable art form that's defining design 
in the Nineties.

Also this week, Shift Control launches the Design Gallery - a brand 
new section featuring the some of the best examples of British art 
and design.

Plus: Shift Control announces the creation of the world's first bionic 
bee, and you have another chance to win Â£200 in our short story 
competition.

All this plus the usual selection of rants, reckoners, reviews and 
revelations, waiting for you NOW at www.shiftcontrol.com
