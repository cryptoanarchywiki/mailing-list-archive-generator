I wish you could be a little more specific.
Harrashing email and excessive cross-posting in violation of each UseNet 
group charter is not
censorship.
If someone sends a gay an email saying "I will kill you. Look out for the 
next gay pride parade" that's is legitimate ground for action.

What is wrong selling privacy for money?
Do you have any prof that Lance Cottrell would "bending over" his 
principles in favour of money.

What court document are you referring as evidence that Sameer Parekh is a 
pathological liar?
