No, I was merely speechless.

If you think that Singapore is a Libertarian paradise then
you are not a Libertarian. I don't doubt that Duncan is
capable of being an appologist for the Signapore regime
just as there were a lot of 'Communists' who used to fawn
over Stalin.

The fact is that Singapore taps every telephone call, monitors
every public place and performs traffic analysis to identify
dissident communities. The fear of being identified in such 
a community is a major means of suppressing dissent.

Duncan and Declan are merely indulging in a very popular
passtime of idealogues, fawning over benevolent dictatorships.
