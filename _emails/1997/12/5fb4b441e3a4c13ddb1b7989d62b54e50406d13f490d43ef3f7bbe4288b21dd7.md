Nonsense, and I'm surprised to hear this from you.
Treat them to the pleasures of the free market -
if you don't like them, start a Boycott M$ campaign,
and see if people stop buying their lousy software.
The direct democracy of the free market is far more 
appropriate than government here - it's $1/vote, 
and if enough people vote against M$ they'll get the hint, 
and it enough people vote _for_ M$, it's none of your business.

It _is_ funny to see the Feds hiring a big corporate lawyer
to run their case; I guess they don't think Federal Prosecutors
are good enough.  Surely if a low-level prosecutor can't hack it,
they should use their boss, and on up the hierarchical chain.
If Janet Reno can't do it either, they should replace her with
someone who can :-) 
				Thanks!
