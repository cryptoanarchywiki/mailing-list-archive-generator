It has not, until very recently, been common to use SSN or driver 
numbers in the UK as ID, I don`t know if they were or were not originally 
intended as ID in this country, I don`t think so, but was met with 
abusive argument and suspicion when I refused to give my SSN a few days 
ago as ID, look like the UK govt. is taking a leaf out of billy-bobs 
book, oh dear...
