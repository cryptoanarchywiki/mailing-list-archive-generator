An Act 

To amend the provisions of titles 17 and 18, United States Code, to provide
greater copyright protection by amending criminal copyright infringement
provisions, and for other purposes. 

     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

     This Act may be cited as the `No Electronic Theft (NET) Act'.

receipt, of anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted
works.'.

     (b) CRIMINAL OFFENSES- Section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code,

or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than
$1,000,

     shall be punished as provided under section 2319 of title 18, United

`if the offense consists of the reproduction or distribution,'; and

                    (ii) by striking `with a retail value of more than
$2,500' and inserting `which have a total retail value of more than
$2,500'; and

     estimated economic impact of the offense on that victim.

     `(2) Persons permitted to submit victim impact statements shall include--

          `(A) producers and sellers of legitimate works affected by
conduct involved in the offense;

          `(B) holders of intellectual property rights in such works; and

section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code, and sections 2319, 2319A,
and 2320 of title 18, United States Code) is sufficiently stringent to
deter such a crime and to adequately reflect the additional considerations
set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.

     (2) In implementing paragraph (1), the Sentencing Commission shall
ensure that the guidelines provide for consideration of the retail value
and quantity of the items with respect to which the crime against
