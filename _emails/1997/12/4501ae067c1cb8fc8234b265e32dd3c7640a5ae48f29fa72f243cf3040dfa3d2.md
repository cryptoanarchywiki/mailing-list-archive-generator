I was alluding to the licensing of ordinary photocopiers and fax machines
(and computers, 
and now internet connections) in statist nations, to prevent their "misuse".  
In the 50's, the government should have 
(from the control point of view) used the hysteria of the times to regulate
*domestic* use of reprogrammable computers.  

As far as justification, bring up the baddies and the sheep cower: the
communist dope smoking child
pornographers with ties to Libya.  What's a little liberty for security? :-<

The develoment of computers can be traced along numerous threads.  One
thread (from say the 40's to 50's)
traces the encouragement of the codebreaking, ballistics, h-bomb fluid
dynamics, and missile
control community.  

By the 50's the computer was done, and improvements were just making better
implementations.

It is admittedly oversimplifying to follow only one thread (e.g., only
mathematical or engineering development),
but in the early days (way before intel) computers were built for the uses
I describe.
