Military and police snipers the world over differ strongly with you...
Beside, it's the 93/G3 not the 91 (thought they do share a lot of commen base
pieces) that is the sniper rifle. I believe you will also find that the .308
is the base caliber for all versions. Your wording above would indicate the
91 was .308 while the 93 was a different caliber, this is incorrect. Visit
the H&K home page...

Really? Watch a few more of those silly police shows on at night. Pay
particular attention to the long-term hostage episodes. I generaly see the
break-in team carrying MP-5 or shortie M-16's. I have yet to see the backup
or sniper team using a bolt-action. Learning base tactics is about the only
thing these shows are good for.

I only use them for long-range shots and it does require the scope to see
the spot - the whole point really. The idea is the beam is of very low power
at this point and doesn't stand out quite as bad as up close (the glowing
red dot).

Bad news, the others guys IR/IIS will spot you in a heart-beat, never use a
laser at nite, it's like tracers - they work both ways. You want to stick
with a strictly 3rd generation passive IR/IIS.

Remember, we're counter-sniping at this point...
