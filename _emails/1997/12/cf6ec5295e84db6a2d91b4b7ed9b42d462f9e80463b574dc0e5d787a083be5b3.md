I can see the advertising campaign now: "Bank at Big Brother Bank, NA
- have your eyes ripped out!"

The device probably has trouble distinguishing between a mannikin with
some real eyes and a real person.  Conveniently for the robbers, the
victim will be unable to identify anybody later.

The plausibility of this threat model has a lot to do with whose eyes
we're talking about.  If they're your eyes, be my guest.  It's
probably safe. ;-)

This is just one of the many risks of deployment of these
technologies, but it's the one that makes even the most docile sheep
pay attention.

Consider the child implant issue.  "You have nothing to worry about
because your child's Protect-A-Life implant can only be removed with
surgery!"  The problem is, that's exactly how it will be removed.
