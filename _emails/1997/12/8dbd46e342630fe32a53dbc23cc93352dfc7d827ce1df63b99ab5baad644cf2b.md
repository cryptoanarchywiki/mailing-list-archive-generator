It's "information wants to be free". A subtle but profound distinction.

It's a real pitty Hayek never tried 'cooperation' instead of 'compromise'.

Oh, the short-short sightedness of ego and tryanny.

What is the line of reasoning that the *only* solution for society is to
stamp out individuality? Sounds more like wishful thinking from some
brain-dead drone with no imagination or respect for others.

Perhaps he should have stuck with economics and kept away from sociology.
