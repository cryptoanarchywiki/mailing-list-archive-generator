If memory serves me correctly then the above was written by the
John Gilmore cleverly disguised as TruthMonger who railed mightily
against the LEAs for claiming lack of resources and manpower for
battling the 4 Horsemen despite the fact that LEAs always seem to
have all the time and energy needed to attempt to imprison the
grandmothers of our great nation who dare to plug a stranger's
parking meter for him or her.
I am always amazed that the LEA pleas for increased funding are
generally based upon their own lack of effectiveness.
i.e. "We are so lame that even with the current mountain of money
and resources at our fingertips we cannot catch criminals who are
much smarter than us."
Perhaps the solution to crime is to fire the current LEAs and hire
the criminals to replace them.

Not that I am a troublemonger...
