>agreement to acquire privately-held Pretty Good Privacy, Inc. (PGP)."

Varous Questions, comments rants, etc.:

Does anyone know how this will affect PGP's:
security, commitment to no-GAK, Founder (P. Zimmerman), the continuation
of the PGP product line?

I heard that McAfee's PCCrypto product will still be sold by NETA as a
retail product, (are they considering 
incorperating the 2 together and just using PGP's team for R&D?)
