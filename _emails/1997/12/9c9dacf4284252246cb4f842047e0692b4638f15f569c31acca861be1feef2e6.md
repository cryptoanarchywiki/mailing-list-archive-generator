On 12/23/97 1:34 AM, Tim May (tcmay@got.net)  passed this wisdom:

>(The notion that the AR-15/M-16 "jams" is based on 35-year-old

 In addition to that they chrome plated the chambers which eliminate
99% of the actions where the extractor would rip off the tail end of
the casing. "obturation" (almost microscopic expansion of the brass in
the chamber at ignition) and the coarser finish of the unplated
chambers coupled up to give a high percentage of jams. When the jam
was tough enough that the tail of the cartridge got ripped off the
poor trooper was up shits creek since he couldn't use a cleaning rod
to remove the shell ... a lot of M16s got bent around trees because of
that! By Nov 68 when I got in country the 1st MarDiv had replaced most
of its M16s with the newer chromed chamber models. I don't know about
other services or outfits.

  I had maybe a half dozen occasions where I put four to six 20 round
mags (the Marines didn't start getting the 30 round mags til the Army
got all theirs - sigh!) through my weapon on full auto in rapid
succession and never had a jam.
