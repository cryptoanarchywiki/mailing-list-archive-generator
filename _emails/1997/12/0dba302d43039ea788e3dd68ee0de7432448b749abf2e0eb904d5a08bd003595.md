Actually, it's legal to possess bubonic plague bacteria, and anthrax as
well.  It's even possible to order anthrax from the same lab that supplied
Harris with the bubonic plague bacteria, and this is reportedly the same
lab that supplied Iraq with its anthrax.  According to Harris, all you
need to provide is a lab ID number, and in fact, this is what Harris was
prosecuted for -- illegal use of the ID number for the lab he worked at.
