The National Defense Panel is to release its study tomorrow,
"Defense of the Homeland," which recommends that Defense 
focus on domestic protection from weapons of mass destruction:

   http://jya.com/ndp-wmd.htm

In line with this, and Tim's NBC prognostications, the Department
of Health and Human Services Office of Emergency Prepareness
has a new Web site which describes its domestic counter terrorism 
program:

   http://www.oep_ndms.dhhs.gov/oep/terrorism/terrorism.html

These tidbits derive from the new list "Terrorism-L," which offers
terrifying scenarios for apocalypse by friend and foe and voodoo 
doll, and survivalist tips for first responders: "There's nothing we
could do."
