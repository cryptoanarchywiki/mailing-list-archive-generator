Joint Venture Associates has joined hands with one of the Nation's Largest
Credit Institution in an effort to issue 20 Million Unsecured Major Credit Cards.

We have tried to make the process of getting  your unsecured credit card
very simple and painless. You will not be asked to sign up with some network nor will you
be asked to pay a monthly fee for the credit card.

You are guaranteed a credit card even if you have bad credit, bankruptcy,
low income, charge offs, or short time at residency. 

The process is simple. Completely fill out the form below. You have two
options. You can mail or fax your request for your credit card. Include your processing
fee of $9.95 

(U S Dollars Only). 

You can fax a check or send cashiers check or money order. The address is
at the bottom of the processing form. By the way, your application fee is 100%
guaranteed. If you do not receive your credit card, your application fee will be refunded.

Here is what you can expect. All faxed processing forms with faxed checks
will be given immediate attention. When we receive your order form we will send you a
credit card application form to you the very next day that will require your signature.

We are currently receiving hundreds of applications per day. Act now and
you will  have  your credit card within 30 days.
