I got _two_ of the apparent "warnings," received by me before there was
even any public announcement of the Jim Bell raid. As Anonymous notes in
his message (snipped here), one of them was titled "Death to Tyrants!."

The headers show no signs of standard forgery, and point back to government
computers.

I took this as warning that Big Brother is planning more raids and is
trying to intimidate outspoken critics.

Some country we live in, eh? The Land of the Freeh.
