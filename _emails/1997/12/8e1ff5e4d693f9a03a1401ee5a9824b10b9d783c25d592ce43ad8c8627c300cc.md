It is most definitely an SSL 3 supported cipher but unless you have the
token or such,
then it is not going to be used for anything, and then only if you try to
connect 
to a Skipjack (ie. fortezza) site.  I doubt you have the code as it is
classified and available (at this time) only in hardware.  Don't sweat it,
it looks like it's just a hook or .....

What environment/flavor of stuff are you running?
I can help you with this if you want to contact me off the list.
