Very well. It's a fact that Dick Morris, Stephanopoulos and Gorelick
are your business feeds, Scaife, Gates and Dell are your sugardaddies 
and USG, SG, and CN have bought you for a Net chokehold 
campaign of global scare dupery, combined with deal for 
industry giants to ruin workaround pygmies.

Your pure-gold credential is all the folks who once trusted you 
to never, ever swap principle for piles of moola (and cut them out).

Now admit it, you're beating hire-me's and lie-for-me's off with 
a stick.

Listen, I've got a near-indicted who needs you.
