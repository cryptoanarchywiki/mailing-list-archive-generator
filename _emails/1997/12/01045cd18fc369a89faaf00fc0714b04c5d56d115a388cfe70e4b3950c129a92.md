It's perfectly legal and within all our rights to have our savings in an offshore trust!  You too can keep your assets  judgement-proof, accessible and completely anonymous by owning a trust in a foreign bank. It's how the rich have been procting their assets for all these years.

Got no money, you say? Here's a good opportunity. You can earn really well, and quickly, as a representative in this very interesting business. All earnings are deposited directly  into your trust. Doesn't get any better than that! Easy to learn reports & training course are available.

Now you can offer Information to friends about tax havens & trusts, assset protection, offshore business & banking, completely anonymous International credit cards, and lowest-rate prepaid national and International calling cards. 

Or - just own a trust... It's worth it. It makes you feel really good....Like your money is not just being wasted, or up for grabs by anyone with enough determination to take it away...
