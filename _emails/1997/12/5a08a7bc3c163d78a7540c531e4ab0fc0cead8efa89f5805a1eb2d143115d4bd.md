    well, let's call for cards on the table. I have Toto's
    Fantasy Island dream world all set to go. all it needs is
    this picture to substitute for the hardcore I found by
    trying Alta Vista's family search with 'fuckin porn'
    --everything nicely bound in scrapbook form, etc.

        http://www.primenet.com/~attila

    access toto's Fantasy Island "dream come true" via the
    yellow circle with 'toto' in the left sidebar next to
    another surprise with an automatic window and jump. touch
    old cigar face robber baron and you'll find some of my Gate$
    rants; other rants off the topbar.

    if nothing else, enjoy the feelthie pictures and wait for
    toto to answer the challenge so I can replace the pictures
    in the stock dream with the real thing.  the old goose is
    waiting to fly you out to the unctious pair.

    well, how about it, toto? --cough the pics up!
    we're all anxious to see your conquest.

    fight censorship, feelthie pictures and all.
