Even more basic questions:  Will NETA release source code?  Will they
continue to develop freeware versions of PGP?  What conections does NETA
have to S/MIME?  What happens to licensing of things like PGPsdk and the
freeware versions of PGP?  Will PGP be seen as a "dead-end" product by
potential new users.  What will happen to Open-PGP email encryption
standard?

This is not good.
