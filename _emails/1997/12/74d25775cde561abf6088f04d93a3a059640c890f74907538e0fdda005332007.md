I think so.  The key here is to have all the nym's mail sent from the same 
remailer, pasting in a From: [nym] header.  The remailer could verify the 
message by checking the digital signature on the message before remailing it 
to it's final recipient/s.  When the recipient sees that the Sender: was the 
nym's usual remailer, he is fairly certain that the message originated from 
the nymholder, but not as certain as when he verifies the digital signature 
himself.

Also, it would be nice if the nymholder could set the Reply-To: header,
thus allowing him to change his inbox "on the fly" (hotmail, a nymserver,
alt.anonymous.messages, etcetera).

Since anonymous remailing is now considered a free service in the minds of 
most of its users, charging for it does not make sense.  I'd be curious to 
know how much money has been collected by the ecash-accepting remailer that 
Ian Goldberg set up a couple months back.

[nym] remailer like I mentioned above may become lucrative if it generates 
enough repeat customers (i.e., persistent nyms).  So could charging a fee 
for each address put in the Bcc: header.
