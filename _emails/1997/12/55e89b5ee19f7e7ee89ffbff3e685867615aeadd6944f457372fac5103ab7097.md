    Article III
    
   
   
   
   
   Section 1. The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in
   one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may
   from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the
   supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good
   behaviour, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a
   compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance
   in office.
   
   
   
   Section 2. The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and
   equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United
   States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their
   authority;--to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers
   and consuls;--to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;--to
   controversies to which the United States shall be a party;--to
   controversies between two or more states;--between a state and
   citizens of another state;--between citizens of different
   states;--between citizens of the same state claiming lands under
   grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens
   thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.
   
   
   
   In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and
   consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court
   shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before
   mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both
   as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations
   as the Congress shall make.
   
   
   
   The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by
   jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes
   shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state,
   the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law
   have directed.
   
   
   
   Section 3. Treason against the United States, shall consist only in
   levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them
   aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the
   testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in
   open court.
   
   
   
   The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason,
   but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or
   forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.
