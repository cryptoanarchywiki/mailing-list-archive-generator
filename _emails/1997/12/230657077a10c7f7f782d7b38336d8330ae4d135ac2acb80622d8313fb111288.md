The Web continues its staggering growth.  According to the just published Netcraft Web server survey, http://www.netcraft.co.uk/Survey , the most popular servers increased in number from 1274396 in November to 1408805 in December (a compound annual rate of over 12%.)

Microsoft's Microsoft-IIS was the bigest gainer both in percentage (2.83) and numbers of sites (70838), while Apache continued to easily hold the high ground gaining only a somewhat smaller 60,000 new sites. The biggest losers were Netscape, slipping almost 3% in marketshare and NCSA.  C2's Apache server, while gaining a healthy 1500 new sites for the month (for an annualized rate of 18,000 unit sales), lost 0.1% in overall marketshare.
