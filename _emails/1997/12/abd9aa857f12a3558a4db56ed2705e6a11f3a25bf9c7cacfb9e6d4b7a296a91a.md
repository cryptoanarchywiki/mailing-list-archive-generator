Oh my, this appears to suggest "leftist" means "liberal," the
evil twin of evil libertarianism.

Some, one or two or least, leftists are far right of the hard right in
opposing big government, and even beyond that in opposing
big business (Time-Warner, say, or ACLU), and ever further 
oppositon to big ambitions for big heads prescribing nostrums for 
the nation and the world under universalizing creeds of liberty, 
freedom and, well you know how liberals and kissing cousin 
libertarians lip and gum.

Say, how do you distinguish between the two libers in matters
of wanting to tell the world what's good for it, wanting to run
it just so? Wasn't it the '60s radicals who pronounced pox
on feverish liberals and rabid libertarians for their righteous
complicity in gov, com, edu, etc., their common inability to
forgo wanting to run things from the top, to hang out with the
most influential, ahem, each other's dear friends, the "leaders"?

Fabulous Ralph Naders, all.
