I can warmly recommend Cyberpass.
Cyberpass does not censor political
speech. 
They provide anonymous accounts to a considerable low price. The
connection is telnet with a UNIX shell and SSH support. Cyberpass is a
division of Infonex InterNet Services. They have a policy "Go and get a court
order" which is very unusual. 
They already host  the OSTARA domain
www.ostara.org containing stupid nazi propaganda.
Others I could mention are
Concentric Network Corporation and Panix - Public Network Corporation and
Webcom.

http://www.cris.com http://www.concentric.net
http://www.webcom.com.
I am sure there are others who do not censor.
But these are those I trust most.
Most ISPs are more concerned about pornography than
hate speech.
