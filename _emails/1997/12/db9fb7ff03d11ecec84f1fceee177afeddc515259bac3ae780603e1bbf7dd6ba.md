I don't know about source code, but remember that the McAfee side of NA
has been letting people use their virus checker as freeware for years
for noncommercial use.

The more interesting problems are how fast will the PGP staff leave
after the merger, depending on what happens to their salaries, stock, etc.,
and how dead the Key Recovery Alliance support in NA is.
Rumors I've heard are that the staff will lose a lot of people,
but on the other hand the KRAP support is pretty dead.

				Thanks!
