You've got this all backwards.  The bearer certificates (paper money) issued by governments is an interest-free loan by those holding the paper to the issuer.

Most of this bad debt is from unwise or even illegal speculation.  I propose that it is much more common for those who deal in money from anonymous sources to look to placing that money into mainstream operating businesses and investments than as assests to back fraudulent loans, although this certainly does happen (perhaps some of the bad debt held by Japanese banks to alledged Yakusa might fall in this latter category.
