See the IRS spam at:

   http://jya.com/irs-spam.htm

And the 7 headers of 19 spams, titled "Death to Tyrants" and 
"Something of Interest" sent to various persons at:

   http://jya.com/irs-header.txt

I recall that Declan offered to ask IRS about the spam,
but do not recall if he was successful.
