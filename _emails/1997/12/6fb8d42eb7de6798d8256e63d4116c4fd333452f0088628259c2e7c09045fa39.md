An intriguing selection of NewSpeak being used here. The forcible ending
of another humans life is wrong (add in the standard caveats for
self-defence). When it is a planed event it is called Murder. No society
in the history of mankind has permitted unrestricted murder of fellow
members of society on such superficial excuses of inconvenience.

To call this murder "choice" just doesn't pass the straight face test. It
is on the same level as calling what the Germans did to the Jews "choice".

While such superficial labeling may make it easier for you and your wife
to sleep at night it has nothing to do with the issue at hand. This is
neither a religious issue nor a left-right issue any more than theft is.

Nothing inconsistent with being a Libertarian and anti Murder.
