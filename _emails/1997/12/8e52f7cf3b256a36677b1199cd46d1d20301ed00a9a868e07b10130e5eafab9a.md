He was also the main spokeman behind the "TWA800 Was Blown Up By Terrorists,
So Turn In All Your Civil Liberties" campaign.  Now that it's been
fairly conclusively demonstrated that it was a mechanical failure,

ID before letting him out the revolving door.

Feh.  Now he can look at your Visa cards.
