That's an interesting legal theory. I recall that when RSA (the republic
of south africa, not the company) mandated racial discrimination in workplace,
various US companies doing business there refused, and RSA didn't give them
any trouble (probably because they'd rather have them violate their laws than
leave altogether). Now, suppose a corporation incorporated someplace where
it's legal to refuse to hire coloreds opens an office in the US - is it not
subject to the same laws as the corporations from one of the 50 states
because it's so foreign??

Hmm! There are some pretty big partnerships. I used to be employed by GS
and by C&L, both of which are partnerships. Do you mean
they could discriminate against coloreds if they wanted to? I thought it
goes by the number of employees.
