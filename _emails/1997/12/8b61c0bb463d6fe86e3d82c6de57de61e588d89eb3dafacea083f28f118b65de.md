 It was the first cicilian marketed semi-auto in the country ... the 
right hand safety can be operated and usually is by the thumb of the 
right hand its a big flat lever with a good sized tab on it, just extend 
the right thumb and push down. The magazine was a non removeable clip 
that could only be loaded from the top, no stripper clips. The one 
drawback to the weapon was it was a top eject and the it was said that 
the ejecting shell distracted the eye of the shooter, personally I got 
used to that within the first 100 round I fired with it.

  agreed ... but .. my point is that racking the slide to chamber a round 
invlved bring the weapon to full cock, which, considering the abysmal 
track record of the the thumb safety removed the weapon from the only 
really safet state which was half-cock ... but that is maybe splitting 
hairs ...

Merry Christmas to you too ... we here in Vermont are having a *very* 
white Christmas already with more snow coming tonite and tomorrow ...
