	The reference goes back to old flint lock muzzle loaders.  You would
"lock" the firing mechanism in a safety position (kind of a half cocked
position), then load it through the muzzle (picture this and some old
cartoons about raming a ball on top of gun powder down the muzzle of a
riffle and the possiblities to picture why you would want this locked on
"safety"), then finish cocking the rifle to prepare it to fire.  This also
relates to the term "half cocked" since a rifle that was only half cocked
(in its locked position) was not ready to fire.  So going off "half cocked"
became a reference to going into something unprepared while "lock and load"
evolved into a reference to actively or vigorously preparing to engage in
something, be it a battle, an arguement, or what ever...
