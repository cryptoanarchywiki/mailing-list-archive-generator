Microsoft has now broken up the Service Packs into Bug Fix and Option Pack
(new feechures) packages.

However the catch is this: they require you to have Internet Exploiter
4.01 installed *BEFORE* you can install the Option Pack (whose features
have little to do with Internet Exploiter, though they are part of the
IIS web server.  For example RAIDUS Remote Access Authentication has
nothing to do with Exploiter.)

IMHO: This is a cheap shot at making their browser more "incorporated"
with the OS, that way they can get around the Justice Dept.  :(  Lame.
Another message claims VC++ requires IE as well -- can anyone confirm
this?

FYI, the final release of the NT 4.0 Option Pack has been posted, you
can get full details at;

http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/default.asp

For those that aren't already aware, Microsoft has split the old Service
Pack into two components. One is the Option Pack, which includes new
features and functionality, while the Service Pack will be kept to bug
fixes or patches only (or so they say, we still haven't seen what this
new SP will look like).

Amongst other things, this first release of NTOP includes;

IIS 4.0
Microsoft Transaction Server 2.0
Microsoft Message Queues 1.0
Microsoft Certificate Server 1.0
Internet Connection Services for Microsoft RAS (Radius)
Microsoft Site Server Express (Web Usage and Content analysis/reporting)
Internet Explorer 4.01

These components will now ship on a separate CD included with NT.

Its important to note that IE4.01 *must* be installed prior to
installing any of the NTOP components.

Cheers,
Russ

  And MSIE must be installed before installing Visual C++.. Soon we hav=
e it
that MSIE must be installed before TCP/IP is installed... and then befo=
re NT
in installed! Is there no limit to this??? Is there any way to prevent =
MS
from *FORCING* us to install MSIE - other than boycott all MS products
entirely (with NT5 it would seem that we have to boycott even the OS to=
 save
ourselves from MSIE)???
  Sorry the bitter tone - I just don't like programs that require me to
install yet another program which I don't want to install.
