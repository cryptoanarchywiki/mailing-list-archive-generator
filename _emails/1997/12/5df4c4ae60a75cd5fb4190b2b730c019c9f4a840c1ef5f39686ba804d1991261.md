- From the laws and Constitutions of the individule states.

Well you can only sue the state that has caused some form of direct damage
against you. If both Texas and Alaska are doing somthing Unconstitutional
but Texas is the only one who has directly caused damage then you should
only be able to sue Texas. Even if Alaska is doing the exact same thing
unless they have directly caused damage against you there is no basis to
included them as a party in your suit. There will be exceptions to this
and one may very well have to sue each state in it's own courts if you
have greviances with more than one State. I think that in the majority of
cases one will find that a greviance will be limited to a single state (I
think it would be very rare to find a case where all 50 states had
directly caused damage against an individule).

An example of this would be back in the 50's with the forced segregation
laws. If you were living in Georga and wished to bring suit against the
state for violating your rights you would be limited to only suing Georga
even though AL,FL,SC,NC,TX,AR, all had the same laws on the books. Now you
could travel to each of those states and then have greviances against each
one but each greviance would be independent of each other and require
seperate suits against them.
