    yes, which november? this nov is gone, but I am still waiting 
    patiently for my share. maybe next year.

    actually, I think I'll hide under the bed and hope the dogs
    cant find me. any man defending himself from under his bed 
    cant be guilty of murder, can he?

    he who dies with the most notches wins?
