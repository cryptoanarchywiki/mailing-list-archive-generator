	Now how could anyone disagree with that;-)

	The problem is: how does someone like my online correspondent from
Jakarta, a self-described innocent in cryptography, deal with his need to
purchase a commercial crypto product now.  I was suggesting helpful
guidelines for a guy with a decision to make, not an optimal solution for a
crypto-savvy buyer in a consumers' paradise.

	If he can get the odds in his favor as far as the basic security of
the products he is choosing among, what he (most managers) will look for is
ease of use, even transparency.

	Come the Revolution, we'll make them all show their stuff, publish
the source code, and dance in the streets.

	Then, of course, we'll have to force other guys to study it and
report to us.

	Once we develop some system of retribution for those who review in
ignorance or exhibit bias, I'm certain we'll have the problem licked.... ;-)
