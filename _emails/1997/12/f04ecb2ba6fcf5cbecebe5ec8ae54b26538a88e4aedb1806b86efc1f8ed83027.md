>Full Article:
>
>Overseas Invasion

>
>Like Coke, Nike, and the tobacco industry before it, Microsoft now has
>to
>hook new consumers abroad. But the company has discovered a way to bully
>foreign companies into buying Microsoft-and only Microsoft.
>
>In 1995 Antel, the national telephone company of Uruguay, was caught
>pirating $100,000 worth of unlicensed software programs from Microsoft,
>Novell, and Symantec. Antel was nabbed by the Business Software
>Alliance, a
>trade association that partly acts as a global bounty hunter for the
>software industry. The BSA's lawyers in Uruguay quickly filed suit.
>
>But instead of waiting for a ruling on the case, the BSA abruptly
>dropped
>the suit in the fall of 1997. The BSA receives funding from most of the
>top
>software companies but appears to be most heavily funded by Microsoft.
>And,
>according to Antel's information technology manager, Ricardo Tascenho,
>the
>company settled the matter by signing a "special agreement" with
>Microsoft
>to replace all of its software with Microsoft products.
>
>The BSA's lawyer in Uruguay, Eduardo DeFreitas, supports Tascenho's
>story:
>"Microsoft told me to stop working on the case because they would write
>an
>agreement with Antel." DeFreitas says Microsoft's Uruguay manager, Tomas
>Blatt, instructed him to drop the suit so that Microsoft could "work out
>a
>deal for the future." Blatt refused to answer questions about the
>settlement, claiming, "I don't have any information about the Antel
>caseÅ .
>You should call
>BSA in Uruguay-Eduardo DeFreitas."
>
>Antel's situation suggests that when  the BSA cracks down on piracy
>overseas, it's Bill Gates who turns out to be the pirate.
>Representatives
>from rival firms complain that Microsoft is abusing its power within the
>BSA to speed its global dominance.
>
>Microsoft denies that the BSA acts solely on its behalf. "I am not aware
>of
>any instance where that has happened," says Microsoft attorney Brad
>Smith.
>And the BSA dismisses the charges; spokeswoman Diane Smiroldo calls them
>"hard to believe." But officials at Novell and Lotus confirm that by
>January, both companies will have stopped actively participating in the
>BSA's programs in Asia and Latin America. Novell says these allegations
>played a part in its decision; Lotus refuses to comment. Such concerns
>are also among the reasons Netscape is reluctant to join the BSA, says
>Netscape attorney Peter Harter.
>
>The accusations aren't just limited to Uruguay:
>
>* Felipe Yungman, Novell's manager of security for Argentina, says he
>and
>another staffer at Novell discovered, while pursuing their own
>investigation for the company, that the BSA was setting up sweetheart
>deals
>for Microsoft. "Companies or government offices had to, as a condition
>[that the BSA] forgive them of piracy, replace Novell products with
>Microsoft products," he says.
>
>were bullied by Microsoft, saying that he is trying to convince them to
>come forward. "Most of the companies don't want to get involved," he
>explains. "They think they need Microsoft. You cannot oblige them to
>testify."
>
>Mario Tucci, Novell's country manager for Latin America, supports
>Yungman's allegations. "If you call BSA, you will reach Microsoft," he
>says. "They shield Microsoft's actions with the BSA name. It's bad for
>us
>and [for] the software industry."
>
>* In 1996, when the BSA sued the Australian shipping company Toll
>Holdings
>for piracy, BSA lawyer Charles Gonsalves, of the Sydney-based firm of
>Mallesons Stephen Jaques, oversaw the case.
>
>"I generally handle cases for both Microsoft and the BSA," Gonsalves
>told
>Mother Jones.
>
>But while the suit alleged that Toll illegally used copies of programs
>made
>by Lotus, Novell, Symantec, and Microsoft, Martin Dunne, Toll's chief
>information technology officer, says the company settled by paying fines
>to
>only Symantec and Microsoft. And, Dunne says, other than keeping
>Symantec's
>anti-virus software, the company has made a significant change: Toll
>only
>buys Microsoft now.
>
>According to a Novell official, Toll "offered to legalize on all
>Microsoft
>products if [the BSA] dropped the suit." Both the BSA and Toll deny any
>impropriety. While a written agreement between Toll and Gonsalves does
>exist, neither party would reveal the terms of the settlement. When
>Gonsalves was asked if Microsoft ever paid for his handling of BSA
>cases,
>he chuckled and said, "That's a confidential matter."
>
>* In Slovenia, where 96 percent of all software is pirated, the head of
>the
>BSA office, Aaron Marko, is also Microsoft's country manager. Marko says
>that because enforcement is difficult in the country's court system, he
>offers discounted Microsoft software to companies caught pirating by the
>BSA. Does Marko see this as a conflict of interest, since he also
>supposedly represents other software firms? "BSA is trying to find the
>pirate. Then it is a question of marketing and product awareness to see
>who
>will get the legal market share," he says. When asked which BSA members
>have local subsidiaries that do local marketing, Marko says only
>Microsoft
>and Oracle, which is not a direct Microsoft competitor.
>
>These allegations "raise questions as to whether the BSA serves the
>interest of its members or whether it serves its dominant member," says
>James Love, director of Ralph Nader's Consumer Project on Technology.
>And
>for the foreign companies, he says, "these seem to be stories of
>blackmail."
>
>The BSA employs a team of more than 100 lawyers and investigators to
>find
>cases of software piracy-a crime it says costs the industry $11 billion
>a
>year. The BSA says it catches "thousands of cases a year," many through
>its
>55 piracy hotlines, the most famous of which urges employees to "Nail
>Your
>Boss" by calling.
>
>While the BSA won't release its funding details, it does say that money
>comes from membership dues, which are based on each company's software
>revenues. This is one way in which Microsoft dominates the BSA:
>Microsoft's
>annual revenues, for example, are eight times that of Novell, its
>largest
>rival.
>
>In the future, Novell and Lotus say they will use their own in-house
>resources for anti-piracy efforts in Asia and Latin America.
>
>But other BSA members, while concerned about Microsoft's role in the
>organization, aren't quite willing to go their own way. Greg Wrenn,
>senior
>corporate counsel for Adobe, says his company has stayed with the BSA
>despite having had some uneasy experiences with Microsoft. For example,
>Wrenn says, the Microsoft attorneys who worked for the BSA refrained
>from
>going after big Microsoft clients caught pirating Adobe products-until
>Adobe prodded them.
>
>Wrenn says Adobe will stay in the BSA, pressuring the organization to
>play
>fair. But he acknowledges Microsoft's upper hand. "If an attorney does
>Microsoft work and BSA work and never hears from another company besides
>Microsoft, he's going to do the work for the guy who's in his office
>every
>week," Wrenn says.
