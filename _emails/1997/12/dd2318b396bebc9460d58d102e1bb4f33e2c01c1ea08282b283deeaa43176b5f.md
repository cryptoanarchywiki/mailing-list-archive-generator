     'Assassination Politics' 
     author gets 11 months

       TACOMA, Wash. - James Dalton Bell, the Vancouver man who wrote an
Internet essay entitled "Assassination Politics," was sentenced this
morning to 11 months in prison and two to three years of tightly supervised
probation.
       Bell's attorney objected to the probation conditions, which bar Bell
from possessing a firearm or chemicals or entering a federal office without
prior approval. He may not advocate violence or overthrow of the government.
       Bell, 39, has been in custody since May. In July, he pleaded guilty
to obstructing Internal Revenue Service agents and using false Social
Security numbers. Bell also admitted collecting the names and home
addresses of IRS employees; proposing the "Assassination Politics" idea
that targeted federal employees, and planting a stink bomb in the IRS's
Vancouver office in March.
