Hi.  I am appalled at the level of informed intelligence displayed on this

I would indeed like to know what you take on a regular basis to conclude 
the above.  Tapping phones?  Monitoring public places?  Analysing traffic?
Whichever parallel universe that you are dwelling in in definitely not one 
I would like to be in.  Your utterly misinformed and totally ludicrous 
statements above can only make me conclude that you are not serious in 
making it, except to respond to all the be-numbed responses by previous 
posters.

I am a Singaporean and have lived most of my life in Singapore.  I am no
lapdog of the government (thank you) nor do I agree with everything the 
government does.  If it is of any interest to you, you can go to my home 
page for information on dirt that I have posted about the SG govt.  You 
can also go to many other sites all over (both within Singapore and outside) 
that discuss a wide array of issues, (www.sintercom.org) for example.

I did come across some ill-informed post (not by Phillip though :-)) that 
said that there are national filters to Internet access here.  Well, indeed,
the top level ISPs here have choosen to use filtering proxy servers to filter 
out an alleged list of 100 porno sites (you can see that there is an on going 
URL hunt to discover these filtered sites on 
www.sintercom.org/hunt/rahunt.html.  You should also visit www.isoc.org.sg 
for additional discussion on this).  Having said all that, this filter list 
is 100% by-passable using sites such as www.anonymizer.com.  

Regards.
