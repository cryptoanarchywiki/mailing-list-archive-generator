Prostitution is legal in some jurisdictions (and will hopefully be legalized
in others), and is openly tolerated in most others.  My question is, does
Colin@ML feel that the prostitutes should be allowed to discriminate when
taking on clients?

Should a prostitute be allowed to refuse to serve black patrons?

Should she be allowed to refuse to serve bisexuals (who are more likely
to infect her with AIDS)?

Should she be allowed to discriminate against prospective clients who
smell bad?

"If you don't want to fuck everybody indiscriminately, don't become
a prostitute."

Sure he does.

Colin@ML reminds me in this respect of the attempt by Russian bolsheviks to
"nationalize" women after the 1917 revolution.
