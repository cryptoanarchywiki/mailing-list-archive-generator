>From Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience":

"Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just 
man is also a prison."

[...]

"If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of 
government, let it go, let it go: perchance it will wear smooth, -certainly 
the machine will wear out.  If the injustice has a spring, or a pulley, or a 
rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself, then perhaps you may consider 
whether the remedy will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a 
nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I 
say, break the law.  Let your life be a counter friction to stop the 
machine.  What I have to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend 
myself to the wrong which I condemn."
