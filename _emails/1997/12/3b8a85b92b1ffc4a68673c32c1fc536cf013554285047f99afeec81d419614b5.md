>>> an about face for the official policy at the NYTimes.
    prior to the decision, the NYT was acting almost like
    an apologist for M$; now they are placing the onus on
    M$: "It is in the public interest that Microsoft be
    required to show that its practices are not 
    anticompetitive."

    should make life interesting; now that M$' momentum
    has been nicked, everybody will join in the great
    Muslim tradition of stoning Bill Gate$ to death.

    Gate$ predicted a year or so ago that M$ would
    suffer a near-death experience --well, BadBillyG,
    is the handwriting on your wall?

        you can fool all the people some of the time,
        you can fool some of the people all the time,
        you can not fool all the people all the time.

            who said that?

NYTimes Editorial / editorial policy statement
Saying No to Microsoft

>>> NYTimes' policy change since the decision:

A preliminary injunction ...
...  is a smart step that preserves the competitive status
quo while the court reviews the antitrust suit brought by
the Justice Department in October.

The injunction is needed, Judge Jackson pointedly wrote,
because the probability that Microsoft will, through its
licensing practices, reinforce its operating system monopoly
and acquire yet another monopoly in the Internet browser
market "is simply too great to tolerate indefinitely until
the issue is finally resolved." ...

...Judge Jackson said Microsoft's idea of what is
"integrated" would appear to render the consent decree
provision meaningless.  If Internet Explorer can be turned
into a Windows component under the decree, so might other
Microsoft products like Word and Excel.

>>> the NYTimes real reversal of statement since the 
    decision:

...It is in the public interest that Microsoft be required
to show that its practices are not anticompetitive.
