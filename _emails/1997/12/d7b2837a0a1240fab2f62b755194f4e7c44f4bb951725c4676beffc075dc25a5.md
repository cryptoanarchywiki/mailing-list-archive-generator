This is part of why the First Amendment is being eroded constantly. It is
seen as a _political_ issue.

The role of the _county_ in hiring or not hiring Keen Umbehr is
problematic, but not because of prior restraint issues.

Were far, far, far fewer persons hired by the government, the issue would
be much simpler.

Suppose RealBig Corporation fired Umbehr for his views. Would a First
Amendment issue have arisen? Of course not. In a free society, RealBig is
free to hire whom it wishes, and to refuse to hire niggers, homos,
perverts, Jews, whatever. And to fire anyone who wrote opinions the
managers at RealBig disliked.

Mr. Umbehr may have had a cause of action based on his employment contract,
and the various rules which govern government employees, but it was hardly
a First Amendment case.

Except in the "liberal" sense, which is exactly why the First is being eroded.
