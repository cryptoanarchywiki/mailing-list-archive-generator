The reason why Declan felt compelled to "run away" from the unmoderated
cypherpunks list is obvious.  You may recall that some months ago
Declan publushed a very negative "expose" of myself in Netly news, and
in it he forged nunmerous quotes from me.  The words Declan attributed
to me in his "expose" were directly opposite of what I told him in my
phone interview and were intended to make me look like an idiot. I've
repeatedly called Declan a liar and a forger on this forum, the last
time just recently. Apparently Declan doesn't like being exposed as the
liar and a forger that he is. :-) He's rather hide out on a censored
forum, where he can suppress the opinions he doesn't like.  Tiny Tim is
happy to bend over and let Declan (or Sandy or any other self-appointed
censor) decide which of Timmy's rants are worth publishing.

You may recall that Declan has another censored mailing list, which he
ironicalled called "fight-censrship". That list is frequented by another
"journalist" whom Declan describes as his "friend" - the pathological
liar Charlie Platt, a psychipath who should be confined to an insane
asylum (and fired from his lab job at New School for his racist hate
speech).  Charlie Platt's been using the "fight-censorship" list to
publish lies about me, and Declan wouldn't let me reply in the same forum
that Platt's claims about me are lies.

I'm not the only victim of Declan's lies and forgeries. E.g., the Center for
Deomcracy in Technology (CDT) complained to Declan's employer, Time Warner,
about Declan's lies, forgeries, and misrepresentations of CDT's position.

Tiny Tim and Declan were long-time supporters of John Gilmore's censorship
of this list and of C2net's/Sandy Sandfart's "moderation experiment". If they
want to get the hell off of Cypherpunks yet another censored mailing list,
but only comment is "good riddance to bad writers".
