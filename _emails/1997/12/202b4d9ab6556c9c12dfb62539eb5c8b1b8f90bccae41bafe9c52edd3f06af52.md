I think the answer to your question is that most of us find the very idea
of filterware distasteful (let alone the generally poor quality of the
implementations.  However, that's much the same as I find american cars
distasteful.  If somebody else wants to blow their money on one of those
pieces of crap, by all means let them.  (I admit, they're slowly getting
better)  This leads us to poke fun at the current systems and argue against
people actually using them, much the same way a christian friend of mine
keeps trying to get me to accept jesus into my heart and love him so that I
won't go to hell.  On the other hand, we get really pissed off when
somebody tries to force us and our kids to use this crap.  It doesn't
matter if it is AOL or the FBI, outside coercion is outside coercion.
