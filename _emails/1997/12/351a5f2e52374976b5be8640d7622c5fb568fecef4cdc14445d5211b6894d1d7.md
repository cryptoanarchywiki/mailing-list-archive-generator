Umm, no, freedom doesn't work like that.  If you open a *private*
establishment, you have the right, according to the constitution, to deny
*anyone* the right to enter or eat in your restraunt.  However, if you
were banned from using the government postal service for being Jewish,
then yes, you are being oppressed.

Depends.  Does it affect your neighbors?  If so, then no.  If not, then
yes.

Tough shit.

If you don't like your job, no one's forcing you to stay.  Just leave it
and get another one.
