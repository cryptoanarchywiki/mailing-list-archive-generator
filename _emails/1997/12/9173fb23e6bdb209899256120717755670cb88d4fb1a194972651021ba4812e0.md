"Japan paid salaries to officials on loan to U.N."

.c Kyodo News Service    

TOKYO, Nov. 30 (Kyodo) - The Japanese government has paid salaries to
its officials on loan to the United Nations for the past 27 years in
violation of the U.N. Charter, a national daily reported Sunday. 

Officials from Japanese ministries and agencies on loan to the world
body receive salaries from the U.N. as well as salaries from the
Japanese government, the Mainichi Shimbun said in a report from Geneva. 

The government has paid billions of yen for more than 1,000 officials
from Japan's ministries and agencies after a law, stipulating government
officials dispatched to international institutions be paid 70 to 100% of
the salaries paid in Japan, took effect in 1971, the Mainichi said. 

The U.N. Charter and U.N. staff regulations ban receiving payment from
any government to maintain its independence. 

An official at the National Personnel Authority was quoted as saying
half the Japanese officials on U.N. assignments are paid 100 % of their
home salary amount. 

Tsukasa Kawada, director of the Foreign Ministry's U.N. Administration
Division, was quoted as telling the Mainichi the payments are aimed at
guaranteeing the status of officials on loan by continuing their pension
and insurance fees' benefit and are not rewards for their duties in the
U.N.
