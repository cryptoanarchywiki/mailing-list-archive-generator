Wit Capital has launched an exciting new service that will help you learn more about the public offerings on our web site.  For selected Wit Capital offerings, in connection with your review of the prospectus, you'll find "virtual roadshow" presentations available for viewing right on your PC.

A roadshow is the process by which underwriters acquaint investors with the products, people and finances of the company whose stock is to be publicly offered.  Traditionally, only institutional investors are invited to see these presentations, but now you can view them at the click of your mouse.

To view a virtual roadshow, go to the Look at New Issues section of our web site, find the prospectus that interests you and as part of your review of the prospectus, click the button marked View Roadshow.  You'll be asked to download a plug-in called RealPlayer 5.0, for which you'll see easy instructions.

We encourage you to read the complete prospectus for any Wit Capital offering.
