Danny, I may respond in more detail to your post shortly (I'm supposed to
be working on an article right now), but I wanted to ask you: 

Does CDT consider itself to be a "civil liberties" group?

If so, how do you reconcile that stance with CDT director Jerry Berman's
statements this week and elsewhere that we need to "balance free speech" 
and "balance civil liberties" with other concerns?

If so, how do you reconcile this with your anti-civil liberties
"compromises" on issues like wiretapping, the "harmful to minors" version
of the CDA you supported, and the "crypto in a crime" jail penalties you
continue to support?

CDT seems to take positions that are often much closer to business
lobbyists than civil liberties groups. Now, I don't mind business
lobbyists -- I'm friends with many of them and I talk with them every day
-- but I want to be clear on your position. 

-Declan
