I don't know what you are smoking but I said nothing of the sort. You
implied that the break with England was for the purposes of overturning
the entire legal system and that English Common Law has no significance on
the current American legal system. I challenged this as it flies in the
face of fact and reality showing your complete ignorance of law and legal
history.

Please, this is all irrelevant to the issue at hand. All legal systems
evolve, English Law of today is not word for word the same as it was 200
years ago this is not to say that it's foundations are not built upon it. 

>Do me a favor, please don't try to lick my hand.

You seem to have your anatomy wrong, if anything it would be my foot and
your ass sir.
