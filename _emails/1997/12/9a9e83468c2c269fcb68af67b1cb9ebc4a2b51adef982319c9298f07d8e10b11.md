Today's hearing in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals went very well.
The judges clearly understood the case -- both the picky legal
details, and how it fits into the general social issue of encryption
regulation.  While we can't predict their decision (or even when it
will come out), we are cautiously optimistic.

We'll put transcripts of the hearing up on the Web as soon as we get
them from the court reporter (in days or weeks).

You may want to examine some early press coverage of the hearing at:
