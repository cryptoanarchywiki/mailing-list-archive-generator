I heard an interview with Chris Ruddy (of Vincent Foster fame) on KSFO 560
AM in San Francisco.  In the interview, Chris disclosed that an Army
pathologist, LtCol Steve Cogswell, was one of the doctors who processed the
bodies from the plane crash which supposedly killed fromer Commerce
secretary Ron Brown.  LtCol Cogswell took an X-ray of Ron Brown's skull,
and found a circular hole .45 inches in diameter in the skull, as well as
some metal fragments inside the cranial cavity, consistent with a gunshot
wound.  The original X-rays were destroyed, and no autopsy was performed to
determine the cause of death; but a photographer took some pictures of the
x-rays while they were on display, and these pictures were NOT destroyed. 
LtCol Cogswell provided copies of the photos of the x-rays to Ruddy, and
they were printed in a newspaper out east somewhere (I missed a few minutes
of the interview).  Today, I heard that LtCol Cogswell has been placed
under a gag order and his his house was searched by MP's.  Something is
rotten in Denmark...
