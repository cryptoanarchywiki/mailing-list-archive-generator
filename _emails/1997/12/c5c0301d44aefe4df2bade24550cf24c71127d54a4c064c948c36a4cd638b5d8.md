The Netly News brings you a four-part exclusive report today on the first
library censorware lawsuit, filed this morning against a Virginia county
that installed X-Stop software. Also check out our upgraded Censorware
Search Engine to see if *you're* censored in Loudoun County -- we now
include databases from IGear and X-Stop.
