How do we know this? And why are they trying to patent a mathematical
algorithm? (The fact they can do it is irrelevent. Patenting a mathematical
algorithm, much like patenting something like XORing pixels on a screen, is
stupid.) And is the fact that they're trying to patent it supposed to make
us feel safer?

Cool. But since we have to disassemble the program to figure out how your
program really handles keys...how do we know this?

FUD and smokescreen. The fact that creating a password program allegidly
violates intellectual property and copyright laws in some country isn't
going to keep somebody from writing one.

I doubt it's much effort. For example it can take 3 weeks for a group of
programmers to write a copy protection algorithm for their new PC game and
about 8 hours for a cracker to break it.

Further, if they're patenting this algorithm it will be public.

FUD.

Well, then again, considering this is Windows which is probably the
worst attempt at an operating system this decade maybe it isn't.

Not an issue if the operating system and/or encryption program are/is properly
designed.

Finally something which might actually be valid.

Unless these people have released source this program should be avoided. The
algorithm is unknown, they aren't telling what it is or how it works, it
hasn't been submitted for review by cryptographers (at least this list hasn't 
heard about it), and they aren't releasing source so you can see what's going 
on. They're hyping security through obscurity as a valid security method,
while simultaneously applying for a patent on their security method and saying 
"Well, if it's cracked we'll just change to another algorithm whenever we
get around to releasing the next binary-only distribution. Hope nobody gets
your data in the meantime."

Further, it is designed for use on an operating system which is notorious
for insecurity, where everybody and everything is root (except under NT,
where you actually have to make some syscalls to get admin privlidges from
an unprivlidged account), where nobody releases source for anything, and
where there is no source available for the OS so you can modify it to fix
security holes or "features," much less add security enhancements of your own.

This entire thing reads like this: "We've developed our own proprietary
encryption method which nobody has ever heard of. We don't really know how
good it is, but you should believe us when we say it's really, really good.
In fact it's so good that we're patenting it just like RSA! Nobody will ever
be able to break it because our algorithm isn't in wide use and we aren't
releasing source! However if somebody actually does break it your data won't
be in the open for long because we'll use some other algorithm which is just
as good as the one we came up with originally and got a patent on. Hope you
didn't need security in that interim and we hope that when somebody breaks
this algorithm they'll tell us rather than taking advantage of all the (for
them) plaintext data laying around."
