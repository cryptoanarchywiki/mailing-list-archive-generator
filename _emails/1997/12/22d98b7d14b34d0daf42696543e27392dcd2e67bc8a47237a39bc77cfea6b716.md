I don't know whether I should feel blessed or cursed now....I spent several
hours today clearing the yard (covered in grass) of tree limbs that were
knocked down from the storm last week and in preperation for the storm to
come in to town tomorrow...still have to mow that green stuff since it's
getting a tad tall...maybe this weekend.

Personaly, I can't imagine why anyone would allow them to build a city
without parks and grass and trees and such. Hell, we have laws in Austin
that make such things mandatory...there is currently a big fight going on
about 'Triangle Park' here in Austin between leaving the 50+ acres at N.
Lamar, Guadalupe, & 45th alone or selling to make a movie theatre and
parking lot. Looks like the trees are gonna win this one...I know my dog
certainly likes romping in the mud puddles...(I live about 10 blocks away)

So big bucks don't always win and the city & state (the park is owned by
the state hospital and currently houses some sort of juvenile center in
one small corner) governments do sometimes listen to the people of a
neighborhood over commercial interests.

Money is not more important than trees sometimes & government sometimes
does listen...

Merry Christmas!
