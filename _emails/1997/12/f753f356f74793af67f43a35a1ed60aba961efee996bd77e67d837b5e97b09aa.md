    well, I would expect nothing less than "Fuck You"
    from Micro$lop --they consider themselves above the
    law. give Jackson credit for realizing the greater
    scope of the problem, and for appointing the special
    master.

    M$' attitude in and of itself is prima facie evidence
    of theit market intent --including tossing out the 
    option that OEMs will still be able to but the 
    _original_ version of W95 if they elect not to take IE4.

   damn white of them boys up there...


Analysis:  Redmond to Judge - [Expletive Deleted]
by Kaitlin Quistgaard and Dan Brekke

4:20pm 15.Dec.97.PST

It took two of Microsoft's biggest guns more than 60 minutes
to utter a reply to US District Court Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson that most of us sum up in two hard syllables.  The
second of which is "you."

For daring to draw a line last week and forbidding the
company to cross for the time being, Jackson was treated to
a marathon rebuke from Brad Chase, Microsoft's vice
president of Internet marketing, and William Neukom, senior
vice president for law and corporate affairs.  

...

Chase made it clear that neither Jackson nor anyone else
would keep Microsoft from readying its planned spring
release of Windows 98 - in which Internet Explorer 4.0 and
the Windows desktop are inextricably bound.

...

Neukom did mention one other alternative that actually
merits the name, and one that government the company finds
itself at war with might actually recognize as viable:
Manufacturers could, he said, install a Netscape browser on
their Windows/IE machines.

>>> what a fuckin' joke. proves their intent to be a 
monopoly and fuck the public interest --it's my way, or
no way!
