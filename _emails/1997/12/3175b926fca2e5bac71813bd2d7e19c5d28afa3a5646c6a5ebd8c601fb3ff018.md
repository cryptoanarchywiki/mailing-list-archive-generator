Uh, oh!  Head for the hills!  Our secret is out!  We have all of these
remailers and they only have ONE USER. <g>

Most control freaks like Gary Burnore and the rest of the DataBasix Gang are
hypocritical about privacy.  They want to invade that of others at will while
protecting their own.  Gary Burnore and Belinda Bryan <eridani@netcom.com>
were worried that their UNLISTED PHONE NUMBERS might be given out, but anyone
who dares criticize their actions with an "unlisted" e-mail address is an
"anon asshole".

OK, let's make Gary happy.  If he's so worried that my asshole is "anonymous", 
I guess I'd better give it a name -- "Burnore" sounds about right to me.  So
to all control freaks -- "stick it in your Burnore".

I'm still wondering what wondrous plans Gary and Belinda had for all
those e-mail addresses of the users of the Huge Cajones Remailer if Jeff
Burchell had turned them over to DataBasux as they had demanded.  (Not just the
senders but the RECIPIENTS as well!)  Fortunately, Jeff was smarter than your 
average Burnore and didn't keep such things around to tempt DataBasix, 
Scientology, etc., so we'll never find out.
