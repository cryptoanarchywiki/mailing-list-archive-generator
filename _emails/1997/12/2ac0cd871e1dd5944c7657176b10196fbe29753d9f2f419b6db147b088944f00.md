I believe this is exactly what Mr. Frissell had in mind.

Incidentally, I heard that last year there were a series of raids on
bookstores for "hate" literature.  One of the books seized was Art
Spiegelman's "Maus".  The justification was that it glorified
violence.  (Feel free to correct me if this is baseless rumor. ;-)

!!! It sounds as if in Germany one may not discuss even the most basic
political philosophy without violating the law.

I'm not sure what is meant by "calling for the abolition of human
rights".  What would be some examples of things somebody could say and
what would be the penalties?  (Presuming you are allowed to give
examples, that is.)

This is exactly correct.

Another good point.  Many in the U.S. have become so accustomed to
these speech restrictions that it seems normal.
