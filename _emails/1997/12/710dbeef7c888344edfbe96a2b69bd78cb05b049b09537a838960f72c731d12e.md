Jari,
  You should also make certain that you only help honest people who
will not become dishonest in the future.
  My suggestion. File all questions away for a period of forty years,
and then, if the person asking the question has proved honest for
that period of time, send them the answer.

  No need to thank me...I'm always willing to help.
