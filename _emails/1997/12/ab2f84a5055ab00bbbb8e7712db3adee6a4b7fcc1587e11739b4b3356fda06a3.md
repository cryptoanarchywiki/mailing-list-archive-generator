PLEASE TAKE 10 MINUTES!


CALL 1-800-678-2632.  

TELL BANK OF AMERICA TO GET GOVERNOR WILSON TO DO MORE TO PREVENT AIDS. Call Bank of America and tell them to urge Governor Wilson to declare a Medical State of
Emergency for AIDS in California.

WHY A STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR AIDS? Because AIDS is a health issue and should be in the hands of the Health Department. 

WHY Bank of America?  BofA spends half a million dollars a year lobbying. Bank Of America  makes large contributions to Governor Wilson. When Bank of America speaks Governor Wilson listens.  

WHY CALL? If you call 1-800-678-2632 and spend ten minutes on the phone,  it costs
BofA approximately $2.50. BofA is paying for the call. 

WHY A TEN MINUTE BOYCOTT? If 5 to 10 thousand people call a day and they each spend 10 minuteds on the the phone---- the phone bill for BofA will be enough to convince the bank to help, to do something decent for society.

WHAT TO SAY?  "Hi, my name is _____________, I am a consumer. I am very
concerned about the spread of the AIDS epidemic and the fact that Governor Wilson is
doing nothing about it. I know that Bank of America spends a lot of money to influence
representatives like Governor Wilson.  I want BofA to tell Governor Wilson to do more to
prevent AIDS. I want Bank Of America to do something decent for society." 

 (one call only please.)

PLEASE FORWARD THIS MESSAGE:  Forward this E-mail to ten friends and have them
e-mail ten friends...don't break the chain! 

Thank you,

Marc Keyser
President
AIDS Action League
