You've noticed that too, huh?  Gary Burnore's "big lie" technique depends
upon his claims being retold over and over, by himself and his associates
such as Belinda Bryan <eridani@ix.netcom.com>, WITHOUT SERIOUS ANALYSIS
like yours, in order to be believed.

Gary's continuous whining about "forgeries" is becoming pathetic.  In his
haste to falsely claim that something was "forged" he missed the fact that 
the claimed "forgery" was traceable back to HIS OWN SERVER.  He shot himself
in the foot trying to frame the remailers this time.  What would be the
point in trying to forge a Usenet post to make it look like it came from 
"mmdf@databasix.com", anyway?

Gary Burnore's forgery allegations against Mailmasher are similarly 
suspect.  First of all, before planning the attack, somebody apparently 
didn't do his homework, or he'd have realized that Mailmasher was a 
web-based 'nymserver, not a remailer.  Despite being challenged to do so, 
Gary has never been able to produce a single piece of documentation showing 
that Mailmasher ever had the ability to paste From: headers.  The "evidence" 
that was posted had truncated Path headers that stopped at the mail2news 
gateway and contained "X-No-Archive" headers, just as Gary's own posts do, 
presumably to explain why none of these posts is independently available 
from third-party archives for verification.  If the posts even existed in 
the first place, they are more likely to have been generated from a 
Netcruiser account, complete with headers designed to frame Mailmasher, 
than from Mailmasher itself.
