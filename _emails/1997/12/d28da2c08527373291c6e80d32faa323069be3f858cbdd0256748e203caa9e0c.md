The Javascript page at infohiway has posted a javascript implementation of 
simple encryption for the web.

http://www.infohiway.com/javascript/indexf.htm

This would be interesting if it had a real crypto algorithm in it like 
IDEA.


===from their page===
Welcome to the ISNâ€° Web Developer's Cut-N-Paste JavaScript,
Perl and Plug-ins Toolbox!

http://www.infohiway.com/javascript

Featuring more than 189 FREE JavaScripts you can simply paste
into your HTML! Plus we have some Cut-N-Paste Perl and CSS
scattered around the site, too!


Cut-N-Paste JavaScript Home / Encryption Scheme

 This little script is really easy to use. Just paste in your message and
you get back your encrypted message... relatively quickly. So long as the 
recipient has the same JavaScript app as you do, decryption will work.

 The sample on this page is of a 4-Bit encryption open architecture scheme 
using only JavaScript. Although designed primarily for encryption of shorty 
emails, the same notion could be used to protect confidential dealer price 
lists, etc. on your public pages.

 Encryption is not just a matter of "jumbling letters". Any amateur 
cryptographer has a whole lot more tricks than that up his sleeve.

 First, our little sample programs permit you to use a key letter, a key 
word or a key phrase of your own devising. What length? You decide. Since 
the length is unknown, we've created a first problem for anyone attempting 
to decrypt it.

 Secondly, they are ultimately recursive. Meaning that you can recursively 
encrypt encrypted materials as many times as you wish. Only you and the 
recipient know how many times. Another problem for the "great decryptor".

 Finally, you can really be sneaky about the key phrases you use. For 
example, you might agree that the key phrase will be the seventh line on 
page 13 of Catcher in the Rye. (Seventh month, thirteenth day) Or you might 
grab the 13th line on a page at a specific URL for this month. Or the lead 
headline from the ABC News Home Page for today.

 If you download this little script to your hard drive, even if the boss 
finds it, it does him/her absolutely no good whatsoever in decrypting your 
email, because the key phrases are absolutely necessary to the decryption 
of encrypted messages.
