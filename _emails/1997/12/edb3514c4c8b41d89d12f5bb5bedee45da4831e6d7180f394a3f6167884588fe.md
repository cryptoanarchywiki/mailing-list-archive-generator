> Congressional Pensions Can Be Hefty
> 
>    By ANICK JESDANUN
>    Associated Press Writer
>    
>    WASHINGTON (AP) A healthy pension plan that members of Congress
>    created for themselves will let some retiring lawmakers collect
>    roughly $100,000 a year for life.
>    
>    Although most members are enrolled in the same retirement plans as
>    other federal employees, lawmakers accrue benefits at a faster rate.
>    Plus, congressional pensions are adjusted each year for inflation,
>    setting them apart from most retirement plans in the private sector.
>    
>    "It's one of the most outrageous perks congressmen have," said David
>    Keating, vice president for National Taxpayers Union, a conservative
>    group that advocates less government spending.
>    
>    According to the taxpayers' group, which calculated congressional
>    pension estimates for retiring lawmakers at the request of The
>    Associated Press, some lawmakers will be going home with pensions of
>    about five times the national average.
