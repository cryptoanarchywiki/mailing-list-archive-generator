This reason has zero credibility. If you want to add
something to the public record, then use your real name,

Why do you think the Nym list was formed? So they
wouldn't have to put up with anonymous traffic, 
that's why. A new one-of-a-kind web site has been

sheeple who are TIME- and LIFE-approved for partaking
in public discourse:
