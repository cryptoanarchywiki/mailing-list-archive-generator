Should be relatively trivial to break the encryption, since it can't be
over 40-bit (or 56-bit if the company joined the kiss-ass alliance).
Probably just as easy or easier to disassemble the software or do some
creative tweaking of Windows DLLs to intercept data.  Custom hardware is
probably out due to cost and distribution problems, and even with it, it's
still possible to intercept data between the hardware and the software, or
the software and the OS.
