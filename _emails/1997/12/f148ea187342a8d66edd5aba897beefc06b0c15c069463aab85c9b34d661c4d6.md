I previously posted an announcement concerning a meeting of the State
Department's Advisory Committeee on Private International Law on the
digital signatures.  There have been two changes.

First, the location has changed.  It will now be held at the Department of
commerce, Conference Room 5855 beginning at 9:30 on Monday, December 15
(until 4:40pm).

Second, it will be a *one* day only meeting.

If you are planning to attend, please notify Rosie Gonzales at the State
Department: (202) 776-8420; fax 202-776-8482; email at pildb@his.com.  Or,
call Brian Hengesbaugh at the Department of Commerce: 202-482-4620, fax
202-482-4076.  In order to register for the meeting, they will need your
name and government agency identification (if any), or affiliation and
address, as well as phone, fax, and email address if available.

Entry to the Commerce Department should be through the main entrance on
14th Street between Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues.

Hotel Accommodations:  There are two hotels that have agreed to offer, on a
space-available basis, rooms at the government rate ($108/single;
128/double).  However, you must advise the hotel when making arrangements
that you are a State Department invitee and that the government rate should
be applied.  They, in turn, will contact the L/PIL to verify
(authenticate?) that you are on the list of attendees, so please make sure
that you have followed the procedures in the previous paragraph.

The two hotels are the Windham Bristol Hotel at 2430 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
(walking distance to State and two blocks from Foggy Bottom metro)
[202-955-6400; fax 202-955-5765] and the State Plaza Hotel at 2117 E Street
NW (across from the State Department) [phone 202-861-8200; fax 202-659-8601].


Hope to see many of you there.
