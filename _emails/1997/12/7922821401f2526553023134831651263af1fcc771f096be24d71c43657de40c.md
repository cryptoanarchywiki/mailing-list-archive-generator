Yep, I'll be there, at least briefly. The DoJ-MSFT hearing is at 1:30 down
near the Mall so I can't stay for the entire thing. A shame; Cato has good
lunches.

Almost every mainstream news article and regulatory report repeats the littany that Money Laundering, that is the movement of money to disguise it origin (even if there are no predicate offenses) must remain illegal because it damages or is a threat to the world banking and financial system (not just the tax take of governments), but I have yet to see any explanation of how and why.  Anyone care to comment?
