    What's the use of encrypting your files if they remain unencrypted,
lying around on your hard drive, reported as "deleted" space, ready for
anyone to steal? And why bother to encrypt your sensitive documents if your
word processor leaves scraps of these documents floating around your hard
drive? Security in the Windows environment seems to be a futile effort.
    Kremlin 2.0 offers an easy-to-use solution to the problem of Windows
data leakage. When you log off your computer, Kremlin can clear your
computer's memory (both the RAM and the swapfile), wipe the unused portions
of your hard drives (where temporary word processing files most often lurk),
and erase all records of your Windows access (such as the most recent
documents accessed, your Internet history, etc). And to securely delete a
file or folder, just drag it to the Kremlin Secure Recycle Bin.
    Of course, the encryption in Kremlin is also first rate. You can encrypt
a file with one of six algorithms (including IDEA, Blowfish, and RC4), just
by right-clicking and choosing "Encrypt". And Kremlin can automatically
encrypt your sensitive documents when you log off and decrypt them when you
log back on, preventing unwanted access to your files.
    Kremlin has been peer reviewed by the best in the business: Chris Hall,
from Counterpane Systems (Bruce Schneier's company), and Alexander Pukall
have both examined the Kremlin source code.
    Kremlin is fast, easy-to-use, and secure; it's the right choice to
protect your data.
