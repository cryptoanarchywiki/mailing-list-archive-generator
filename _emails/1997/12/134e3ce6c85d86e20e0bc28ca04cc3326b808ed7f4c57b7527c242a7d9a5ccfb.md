The NYT reports today on the MS-DoJ case and notes that
Microsoft has opposed the administration on several
issues -- one being encryption -- which have captured the
attention of publicity-seeking legislators as well.

Another NYT report is on Microsoft's past neglect of major
lobbying of the government and bigtime contribution to PACs, 
in contrast to other industrial giants, and that MS it is fast coming 
around on both counts now, with big bucks being poured into 
DC coffers of PR firms. (Could this beneficence be the incentive
of $ieger and $habbar?)

The report notes that Microsoft is for the first time beginning to
consider that it cannot continue to grow without coming to
terms with the USG, the lesson all the giants have learned so
well and are happy to see Bill Gates cut down to fit the mold.

Now, was it not the case that not too long ago Microsoft was
allegedly funding the strong crypto bills? And is a plea bargain
in the works for MS sentence of worldwide GAK in Explorer?
