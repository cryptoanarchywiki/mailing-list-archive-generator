Well here it is, as it's pretty short:

Sounds like good news to me.

: Network Associates Withdraws from Key Recovery Alliance
: 
: Network Associates made the decision today to withdraw from the Key
: Recovery Alliance. The decision to withdraw has been made based on the
: acquisition of Pretty Good Privacy, Inc. (PGP), announced on December
: 1.
: 
: Network Associates' decision to buy PGP was based on a commitment to
: PGP's product line and the deployment of strong cryptography.
: 
: NAI believes that although the Key Recovery Alliance is not in itself
: a political organization, membership in it has unintended political
: consequences that outweigh any technical benefits we may receive.
