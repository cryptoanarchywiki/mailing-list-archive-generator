Body Parts May Become a Way To Identify ATM Customers

By GORDON FAIRCLOUGH 
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Thomas J. Drury walks up to the automated-teller machine in his suburban
office and swipes his bank card. Instead of punching in a secret code,

on ATMs around the world. It is being tested by NCR Corp. and Citicorp,
among others.
