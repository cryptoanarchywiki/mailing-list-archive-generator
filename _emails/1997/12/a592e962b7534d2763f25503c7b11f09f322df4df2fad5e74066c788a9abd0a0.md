I suggest we schedule another one for New Year's Day. New Year's Eve is when
everybody parties and gets drunk. 

Also, is there any way to IRC anonymously? The situation is complicated by
the fact that IRC, like any real-time communications system, requires
real-time stream connections which are traceable back to their sources.
CROWDS isn't advanced enough or designed to hide arbitrary TCP/IP traffic,
though it could have been.
