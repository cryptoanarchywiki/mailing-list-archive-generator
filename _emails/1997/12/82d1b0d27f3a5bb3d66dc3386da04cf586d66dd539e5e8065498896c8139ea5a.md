 I can't agree that the HK 91 (the .308 version) is a popular sniper
weapon. Very few are in use in the U.S. (Heckler and Koch does have the
PSG-1, but at $10K it's too steep for U.S. departments).

For sniper work, a bolt-action is by far the most popular piece. The
Remington PSS (Police Sniper Special, as I recall) is common. (I almost got
this model, but like the Varmint Synthetic--Stainless Fluted (VS-SF) a bit
more.)

Check out Plaster's "The Ultimate Sniper" for more on current sniper
weapons, current as of 1994-5.

I'm also skeptical about lasers, for daylight use. The three lasers I have
owned have been good for indoor use, but visibility outdoors during the day
is very poor.

(IR lasers with IR night vision gear is another matter, but also another
price matter, too.)

Speaking of the MP-5, I had the civilian model, the SP-89, for a few years.
This had a laser on it. Fun to shoot, but the 9mm rounds are too wimpy for
my taste. (Considering the targets I'm preparing to defend myself against
are wearing body armor.)

I sold the SP-89 for $2400, well over twice what I paid for it. BTW,
getting a functioning, legal MP-5 will cost more like $5K. Hardly worth it.
