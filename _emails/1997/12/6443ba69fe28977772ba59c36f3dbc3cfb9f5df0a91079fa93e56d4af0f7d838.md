I can think of a couple of ways this could be implemented.  You could either
allow the user to select an e-mail address to use, then do an nslookup to 
verify that the domain does not exist, or else choose a domain that's actually 
nothing but a bit bucket.  The cleanest implementation might be to create a 
"bitbucket.efga.org", alias all incoming mail (except for perhaps "postmaster") 
to /dev/null, then assign  non-replyable 'nyms off of that.  That would 
eliminate the need for managing reply blocks and confirmation cookies.

This is much more preferable to these people you see who post with a From:
address of "nobody@nowhere.com", probably not realizing that nowhere.com is
actually a real domain.

But implementing such a server is still a lot more work than simply allowing
From: headers to be pasted and allowing source blocking for anyone who is
worried about being the victim of abuse of such a scheme.
