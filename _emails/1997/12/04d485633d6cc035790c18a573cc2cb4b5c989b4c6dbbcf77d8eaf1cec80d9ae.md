Right mounted safety? Sounds like a lefties gun. Safeties are usualy thumb
tripped which means they are on the left. The idea is you can safety the
weapon without taking your finger from the trigger. That could explain the
loading problem, guns built for lefties typicaly have all kinds of weird
handling issues. It sounds to me like a real nightmare to load and use in
the bush since you have to take your hand off the gun in order to get the
safety off while you load another round while cycling the bolt through its
action - eliminates snap shots that's for shure. Do you know if it is a
lefty build? If so then it clearly isn't a military grade weapon since they
are ubiquitously designed for right handed firers (at least until the last
20 yrs. or so).

Once the clip is in place, top feed since you said "push down", does the
safety prevent the cycling of ammo through the breech? Does it use a
stripper clip or a carrier? You don't happen to know the type of action?

Is this a military grade weapon or sport?

Interesting since the 1911 I use doesn't exhibit this ... I don't
have a problem loading it irrespecitive of the safety. If the safety is on
the hammer is blocked from the bottem by a lever. You can put ammo in it,
cock it via the slide, etc. Just can't pull the trigger. Will have to look
more into this...

Thanks for the info.

Merry Christmas!
