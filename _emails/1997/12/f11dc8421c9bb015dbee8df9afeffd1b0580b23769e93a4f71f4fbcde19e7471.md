Seems like a crypto module for Linux would be a good start, if there's not
one already. As part of Linux, the source would stay public domain, so you
could trust it. It also seems security built into the OS would be the
hardest to circumvent. And finally, since Linux is free, there's no
obstacle besides convenience for people on other platforms to acquire it
(and it runs on several types of hardware). Thus, the crypto module could
also help Linux, which is also good for keeping people in control of their
computers. I'm getting to where I don't trust any program I can't see the
source code of.
