As wonderful as eye scanning technology may sound, it promises to offer
very weak identification and only be reliable in the short run.  This is
based on the premise that a reproduction of an eye will work as well.  Just
as a reproduction of a driver's license seems to work for check forgery.

PINs offer security based on the fact that they are a secret.  Not a shared
secret.  For comparison, take a look at the authentication procedure of the
SSA and Wells Fargo bank.  Over the internet, both want 

  Social Security Number
  Date of Birth
  Mother's Maiden Name

Imagine a bank machine requesting the same info as the only prerequisite
for dispensing cash!  This info might have been a method of secure
authentication about the time I was born, but today, such info is almost
common knowledge.  This no longer is a secret, too many people have the
info.  Widespread use of eye scanners will provide the same results.  As
databases are built, and sold, the raw info becomes available and automated
tellers become excellent targets for fake authentications.  If you get it
wrong, you just walk away.

Eye scans may help aid authentication, but they should not take the place
of PINs.
