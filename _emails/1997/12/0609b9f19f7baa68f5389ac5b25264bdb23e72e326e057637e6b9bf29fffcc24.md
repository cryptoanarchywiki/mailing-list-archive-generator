The driver's license cops won't issue a license without a SSN. The bank
won't do business without someone with an SSN. Even my gun range wants my
SSN.

But I have a new SSN to give them:    539-60-5125

Of course, don't try this at home. SSN fraud may land you in prison for a
year, while murderers get seven months in prison. And while double
murderers have to sell their houses in Brentwood.

Only in Amerika, where the lunatics run the asylum.
