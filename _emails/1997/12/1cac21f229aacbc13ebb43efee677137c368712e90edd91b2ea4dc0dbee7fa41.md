And if someone makes what you consider an annoying telephone call from a
public telephone, should the phone company remove the telephone?  Sure, they
may be able to trace the telephone used, but not who used it.

Just as the anonymous person is paying for his own access to the internet.
The anonymous caller to your telephone is not paying your monthly telephone 
bill, though, so he's not "paying all costs for the call".  So the two 
situations are fairly analogous -- both the sender and the receiver of the
message pay a portion of the costs.

If the person is foolish enough to stay on the line long enough to be caught,
that is.  I really doubt that most localities have a police force with enough
time on their hands to go chasing after a person who annoys you with a 
phone call, though.  Anything "sufficiently organized" to accomplish what
you're suggesting would be indistinguishable from a police state.  While it
might annoy you if someone were to call you at 2 AM from a pay phone, yell
"You're an asshole", and hang up, how much money, time, and effort do you 
really expect the police to spend trying to find the culprit?

As a practical matter, they'd probably suggest that you change your phone
number or put a device on your telephone where callers you wished to talk to
at 2 AM were required to enter in a code you'd given them before your phone
would ring.

In the case of an anonymous e-mail, the "post office" is the remailer site.
Like a snail mail letter, you don't know what path the sender travelled to
get to the post office, though.

> You'd be amazed
> how often people who send "anonymous" letter bombs get caught.

Yes, for both the e-mail and snail mail variety.  It's much easier to send
an e-mail bomb from a throwaway ISP account than from a remailer, anyway.
Most remailers have fairly small size restrictions, for one thing, and if you
start sending too many individual e-mails through a remailer, the software
WILL take note of that fact and flag that fact for the operator.

In many ways, sending a "mail bomb" "anonymously" is an oxymoron.  The whole
point to avoiding being traced is to make your message virtually 
indistinguishable from the rest of the anonymous messages until it reaches
its destination.  Sending a huge message or a huge number of smaller messages
sticks out like a sort thumb and calls attention to the sender.  The last
thing the perpetrator of such a scheme would want to do is go through
automated software, such as a remailer uses, that looks for and flags
unusual behavious like that.  It would actually me much safer to use a
throwaway e-mail account, acquired under a phony name, to accomplish that.

Then you already have that.  If you don't want calls from a certain caller,
you can arrange to have them blocked.  If you don't want "anonymous" calls,
you can have incoming calls without caller ID information blocked, just as
you can request that the remailers not send you any anonymous e-mail.

(None of this really has anything to do with anonymous PUBLIC posts.)

"Presumed innocent until proven guilty" is still in force here.  I might well
say that I can see no purpose for owning a printing press other than to print
"subversive" material, yet I still retain that right here in the USA until
you can prove that I've used it for illegal purposes.  If you can prove that,
then you can get a court injunction against me.  But you can't take away that
right based on what you think I *MIGHT* do.

Of course, sometimes "breaking laws" IS the reason for anonymity.  If the
government were to outlaw the dissemination of certain politically incorrect
ideas, then the only way to safely do so might be anonymously.

If you feel that strongly about anonymous e-mail, then simply ask the
remailer operators to have your address blocked from receiving any.  Your
(potential) problem is then solved.

I'm sure they are, but the extra costs of positively IDing users would have
to be paid somehow.

Of course they can.  Ultimately, each person is responsible for maintaining
his own privacy.  There's always a risk.  Those who anonymously (and illegally)
used fax machines to send uncensored news out of China during the Tianamen
Square uprising were obviously taking such a risk.  Does it bother you that
the technology did not exist to identify and prosecute those who did so?

Perhaps, but there are more suitable remedies for that than banning anonymous
e-mail.

No, but that's a different scenario than the telephone company requiring a
form of positive identification before using a pay phone.  You aren't
assuming that these "repeated offenses" involving pay phones all were made
using the SAME TELEPHONE each time, are you?  Not all harrassing callers
would be that stupid, although some might be.

In the case of anonymous e-mail, you can trace it back to the remailer 
utilized just like you can trace a phone call back to the telephone used.  
But what does thay buy you?  You still don't know WHO made the call or sent 
the e-mail.  Actually in the case of anonymous e-mail you have one additional
safeguard.  You can ask to be blocked from receiving anonymous e-mail.  Try
telling the telephone company that you want to be blocked from receiving
calls from any pay phone!

That's really unnecessary.  There's not really much you can do via e-mail
that's both illegal and anonymous, when you think about it.  I could
kidnap a relative of yours, and use anonymous e-mail to make ransom demands,
but I'd still have to give you a means of getting the money to me.  THAT is
where I'd be traceable.  The same goes for sending you a fraudulent offer.
I can't make any money off of you unless you give you a method for paying
me.

And if something is merely annoying, then prevention makes more sense than 
building in the ability to hunt down the sender.

Like anonymous e-mail itself, any surefire means of identifying the sender of
a message is also prone to abuse.  That's why the "Big Brother Inside"
concept is a cure that's worse than the disease.
