So your premise is that the changes that were implimented at the time of the
Constitution were all the changes that the founding fathers had in mind? You
hold that while it is clear that the founding fathers recognized that the
quantity of change required was such that they would not be able to
impliment it realisticaly since nobody would accept that range of change at
one time? You further hold that the Constitution is not a document that holds
an ideal of freedom for us which will require generations of striving? You
seriously expect to get up one morning and find that no new laws will be
needed and that we have solved all the issues respecting human interaction?
You further hold that with 200+ years of English jurisprudence behind us we
have actualy attained that nirvana?

In short, you would have us take it all - the good and the bad - and ignore
our right to pick and choose what works for us?

If we accept your view, blacks would still be slaves and women would still
not be able to vote, and men couldn't vote unless they were landed.

Do me a favor, please don't try to lick my hand.
