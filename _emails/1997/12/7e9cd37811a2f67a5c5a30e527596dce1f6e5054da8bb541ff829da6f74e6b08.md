Okay, I'll avoid that since I have never read a scrap of
corporational law.

Just out fo curiosity -- if I were to take my taxes out like I
were operating a business out of my house without declaring I am
as such, and then not take the "excess" tax money back as a return,
would the Fed have any grounds for suit of fraud, since I had paid
all the taxes of a business properly?

What I'm wondering is if the fraud charge would be because I haden't
paid the proper taxes or not.

I haven't seen or read the book.  However, it would seem to me that
equal opertunity and equal outcome aren't one and the same.  While
you are making it possible for folks who wouldn't normally hit the
middle income road to do so, you are then also restraining the
brighter bulbs from taking off like NASA rockets (and the analogy is
correct, since being a genius doesn't guarantee success).
