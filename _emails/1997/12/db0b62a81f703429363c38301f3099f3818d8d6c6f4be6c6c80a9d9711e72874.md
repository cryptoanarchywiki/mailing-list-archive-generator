  Considering the butt-fucking that Seiger has helped CDT give those
they purport to be 'saving' from the goobermint, I imagine that he
will be welcomed with open arms by politicians in need of a thick
layer of bullshit to cover the even worse stink arising from their
true identity.

  Many of those who bent over to read the CDT missives felt the "impact"
of Seiger on their civil liberties. "Asset" is an obvious typo, adding
two unneeded letters to the description of Seiger's contribution to
the CDT.

  No doubt enough of their 'old' audience are getting wise to them,
so they have to find new rubes to pitch their Democracy Aluminum 
Siding to.
  A pox on them and every other DC slimeball using the cover of fighting
for freedom and democracy to feather their own beds at the expense of
those who trust them not to sell out the citizens a compromise at a
time.
