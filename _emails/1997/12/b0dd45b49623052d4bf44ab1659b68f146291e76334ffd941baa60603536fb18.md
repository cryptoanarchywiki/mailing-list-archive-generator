If I was wrong, nobody ever corrected me despite my
posting the complaint repeatedly to comp.org.cauce.

Look up the original posts at DejaNews:

#   I think you are missing the point.  I replied to the original message.
#   That's how the strange moderation policy thread got started.  The fact
#   that a thread was started proves that I went through the cookie
#   exchange properly.  The problem is that that e-mail address seems to
#   have been subsequently banned with no apparent expanation.  Or, there
#   is some technical problem.
#
#   It's definitely the case that mix@anon.lcs.mit.edu bounces a copy of
#   non mixmaster messages back to the sender in case the sender didn't
#   know it was a remailer and wants to resend the article somewhere else.
#   However, that doesn't mean I can't spool such messages in a mailbox
#   and read them if this is required by the moderation policy.
#
#   I just want to know exactly what the policy is and what I need to do
#   to post from the address mix@anon.lcs.mit.edu.

They never answered. Not him, not me.

Speaking of problems: it's definite: the great attempt to
censor the Internet has begun in England.

Mainly Usenet is under attack: pics of mere nudity are being
deleted without any legal process whatsoever.

See my posts in comp.org.eff.talk ...

I've put two pics of nekked kids up at www.panix.com/~guy
as part of the "discussion".

They (Demon, UUNET, ...) are deleting both pics and
apparently text files too, and reporting them to the
police.

The Thought Police are here.
