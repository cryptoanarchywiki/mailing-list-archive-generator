Officials Detail Separatist Role in New York City Tax Scheme

...

To illustrate, Chip Berlet, a senior analyst for Political Research Associates in Somerville, Mass., cited the Web page of Hakim H.Y. Bey, who investigators say appears to be a philosophical leader of the Moorish Nation operating in the Bronx, and who is someone they want to question in connection with the tax-fraud scheme.

Bey's Web site includes links to an abundance of sites -- from the home page for Mother Jones magazine, for example, to the sites of several fringe groups, including the Militia of Montana, a white separatist group, and James Daugherty, a white Michigan man who proclaims, "The Overt and Covert Organs of the Vatican and British Empires are Locked in Mortal Combat for Control of the World."

"You have separatists and conspiracists both looking at the United States government as the fount of all evil," Berlet said. "It's in the interests of both to bring down the government, so they have a working coalition."

The Bey Web site offers informational packets on Moorish studies and videotapes of lectures but makes no mention of tax kits.

Efforts to reach Bey at what is believed to be his last known address in the Bronx and through the Internet were unsuccessful.
