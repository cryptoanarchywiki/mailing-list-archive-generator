That's absolutely correct.  That disclaimer should be implicit with
EVERY post.  Attaching it to anonymous posts, while technically
correct, gives the false implication that posts without such
disclaimers should be presumed to be genuine.  That's a dangerous
assumption.

Anyone who wants to post an article with a phony From: address can
do it far easier with a throwaway ISP account and news posting
software that can be configured with an arbitrary From: address
than going to the trouble of doing it through a remailer.

Could it be that the enemies of privacy and freedom, if they can't
ban anonymous posting altogether (at least not right now), would
like to make sure that anonymous posts are stigmatized with the
cyber equivalent of a yellow star?  If some control freaks are to be
believed, the only people who post anonymously are either "abusers",
"cowards", or otherwise have sinister motives for not promiscuously
broadcasting their names and addresses worldwide with every post.

My theory is that what really galls them is that the precursor to
the U.S. Constitution which guarantees freedom of speech (including
anonymous speech) was the ANONYMOUSLY PUBLISHED "Federalist Papers",
and they want to make sure it doesn't happen again. <g>

Don't give the Usenet control freaks any ideas!  <g>
