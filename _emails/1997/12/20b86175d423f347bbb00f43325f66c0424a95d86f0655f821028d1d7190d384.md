My guess is it has brought in very little money.  There is really no
reason to use it.  It seems to be the same as the jam remailer which
is free.  I had hoped to use it as an exit remailer, but even that is
a loss as it apparently uses cracker (?) for that purpose.

What we did learn is that it isn't that hard to set up a remailer to
accept ecash.  I doubt we've learned much about the market potential.

The recent reports of the anonymizer pulling in $180,000 annually are
worth thinking about.

This is a good idea.  Ecash accepting remailers should offer perks
which are not generally available, or just offer a faster more
reliable service to paying customers.  For example, free messages are
delayed 90 minutes while paid messages are sent immediately, modulo
some details like mixing.
