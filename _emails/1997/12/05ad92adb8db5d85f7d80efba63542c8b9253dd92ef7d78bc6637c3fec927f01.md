I refuse to hire Colin@ML because I during the technical interview I asked him
the same questions I ask all other candidates, and he demonstrated his utter
ignorance and stupidity. Hence I discriminate against the clueless.

I refuse to hire Colin@ML because his skin lacks the appropriate pigmentation
(I presume: I know first-hand that very few blacks work for ML), and the
gubmint mandated that I set aside most of my contracts for folks with the
appropriate skin color. Am I discriminating against Colin@ML?
