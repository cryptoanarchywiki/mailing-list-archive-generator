I'm not sure how you're involved in this scenario, nor what your source of
information is.  I was quoting from a public post by Jeff Burchell, the operator 
of the remailer in question, and he specifically stated that the so-called "spam 
baits" began AFTER Gary Burnore had demanded that Jeff turn over his remailer 
logs to DataBasix, and BEFORE Belinda Bryan sent him the letter claiming to be 
with DataBasix' "legal department" and formalizing that demand.

Read it for yourself:

-> I still don't know what the hell is going on with DataBasix, Wells Fargo
-> and Gary Burnore, but I suspect that someone used huge.cajones to say
-> something extremely unflattering about Burnore (from what I can tell,
-> he had it coming).  Burnore then decided that he would make things
-> difficult for me.  First, he wanted the user who had posted something 
-> "inflammatory" about him revealed.  When I told him that I couldn't
-> do that, he carried on about mail logs and identifying the host that
-> a message came from (the usual).  I didn't explain to him that my
-> machine keeps logs, but not anything involving a *@cajones.com
-> address.  He then requested the logs, which I denied (and told him 
-> to get his lawyer to send a request...)

Here comes the key part:
  
-> Between the time he first contacted me, and the time I received the 
-> letter from Belinda Bryan, is when the baiting of databasix addresses
-> began (slowly, with just a few posts).

It appears that his account differs from yours.
