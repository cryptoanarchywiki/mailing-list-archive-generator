And the difference between `selecting' which books to acquire for 
the library and `selecting' which web pages to receive is what?
Those pages `not selected' by the Internet filter are not `reduced'
any more than the `not selected' books.  There is no consistent
application of principle in your arguments.

Then rub a couple of neurons together and see if you can generate
a spark.  If the government isn't in the business of either `selecting'
books or internet pages, then there is no `selecting' to be done in 
either case and therefore nothing to be solved.
