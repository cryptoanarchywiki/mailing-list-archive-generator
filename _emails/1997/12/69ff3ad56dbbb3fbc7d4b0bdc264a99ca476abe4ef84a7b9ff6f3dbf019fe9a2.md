As an added bonus at this time of release, and to ensure an enjoyable 
listening experience, we can now offer you, for a limited time, the 
Roland Virtual Sound Canvas Music Pack (VSC-550W). This is Roland's

    * DoReMiX unique music creation software 
all on one CD-ROM.

The Roland Virtual Sound Canvas Music Pack sells regularly for $57.  
Add Crescendo PLUS for Netscape and Internet Explorer, and the 
entire package is worth almost $100. 

By special arrangement with Edirol Corporation (distributors of the
Roland Sound Canvas in North America), when you purchase the Crescendo
Plus Roland Edition today, you will receive all the above software 
listed for a special value price of only $65 (including Shipping & 
Handling!)  Note: This offer is only available to addresses
