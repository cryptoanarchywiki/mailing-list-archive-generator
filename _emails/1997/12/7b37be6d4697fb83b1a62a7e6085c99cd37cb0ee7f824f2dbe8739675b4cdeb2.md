I've seen a couple and there are *lots* of references to the various manuals
(and I think every wanna be professional soldier in the last 500 years has
written one at some point) in the various readings I do studying tactical
combat techniques but that doesn't make me an expert by any stretch
of the imagination. The very fact that there are so many and so many were
never accepted (quality?) means even they are by no means a final reference.
I would like to know if there were exceptions or even who wrote the first
manual with 'lock and load'...

Yuck, I had a house fire going on 3 years ago now. Every time I smell a
bar-b-q pit I remember it...;(

I've seen that sort of behaviour as well. I've tried to demonstrate the pipe
model and truth be told, it works only about 9 out of 10 times. Black powder
just ain't that unstable.

Agreed...
