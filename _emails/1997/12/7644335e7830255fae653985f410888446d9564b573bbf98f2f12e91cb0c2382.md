This seems to me to be a step backward. Indecent at least has an implicit
relationship with sex while harmful to minors does not. Does the bill make
some notice that it applies only to sex and sex related issues or can this
be applied to any subject matter that would be harmful to minors? This
could impact all sorts information such as bomb info, ways to make booze, 
drug related sites, etc.
