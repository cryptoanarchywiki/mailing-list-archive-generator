I've seen brief mention of this before, but have never seen 
any details on the list. Aside from Jim Choate questioning
my arithmetic or attention span, would anyone be kind enough
to provide pointers to information about incidents of c-p
list members having received unsolicited email from .gov?

Declan, did you catch a whiff of this when it happened? I 
would think everyone's alarm bells would have gone off and 
people would have been intensely interested in the messages 
themselves, particularly the headers.
