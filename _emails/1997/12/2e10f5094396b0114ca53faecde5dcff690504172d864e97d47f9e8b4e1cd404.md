And that in turns reminds me of microsoft giving away a free web browser...
Here's why: in 19th century NYC there very many excellent private libraries
where one could pay a monthly fee and either read inside or borrow books.
Then the gubmint (the state, the city, doesn't matter) created "free" public
libraries (i.e., paid for by the taxpayers, most of whom probably don't give
a flying fuck about libraries), and drove almost all private for-pay libaries
out of business.

Perhaps the state shouldn't be in the business of providing library services
to begin with; then there will be no 1st amendment issue, and if you don't
like the censorware used by a private library, why, use another private
library, or start your own.

(Nor would there be an issue with private libraries refusing service to
readers who smell bad.)
