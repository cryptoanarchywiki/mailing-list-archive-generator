     December 13, 1997
     Bank of America, Kroger, Mr. Payroll Agree
     To Test Automated Check Cashing

     Consumers and Retailers Benefit From Facial Biometric Technology

     <Picture>


     (Fort Worth, Texas) - Fort Worth-based Mr. Payroll Corporation , a
     wholly owned subsidiary of Cash America International (NYSE:PWN),
     along with Bank of America and The Kroger Company announced today they
     have entered into an agreement to test the Mr. Payroll automated
     check-cashing machine. The machines will be installed on December 16
     in three Dallas area Kroger locations.

     Mr. Payroll, the world's first self-service check-cashing and
     automated teller machine, uses facial biometrics (the same technology
     now used to authenticate identity in the Pentagon) to identify users.
     This technology allows people with and without a bank account or photo
     identification to cash their payroll, government or personal check.

     "We're excited to have Bank of America and Kroger join us in providing
     consumers with 24-hour access to check-cashing services. This is a
     milestone for Mr. Payroll," said Mr. Payroll President Mike Stinson.

     "We're looking forward to testing this new check cashing technology in
     these Kroger locations," said Bank of America Vice President David
     McCary. "Providing financial services at popular retail locations
     enhances convenience for consumers."

     According to Manager, Store Services and Technology Jim Gehling,
     Kroger expects automated check cashing provided by Mr. Payroll to set
     a new standard in customer service in select stores. "To help
     introduce our shoppers to the machine, we're going to offer free check
     cashing through January 31, 1998," Gehling said.

     Consumers can look for the new machines in Texas at the Kroger stores
     located at 536 Centennial in Richardson, 235 E. FM 1382 in Cedar Hill,
     and 4142 Cedar Springs in Dallas.

     Mr. Payroll, which guarantees 100 percent of every check, has
     successfully cashed more than 25,000 checks since June 1997, when the
     first machine was installed at a convenience store in Fort Worth,
     Texas. To date, Mr. Payroll machines are operating in 18 convenience
     store locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada,
     Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas.

     Bank of America Texas is a subsidiary of BankAmerica Corporation
     (NYSE:BAC), which has nearly 2,000 branches in 11 states. At September
     30, 1197, BankAmerica had assets of $258 billion and deposits of $171
     billion.
