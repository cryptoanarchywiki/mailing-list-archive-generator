Good one, Bob.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Online pornographers should be required to use
encryption, said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, (R, Va.) Tuesday at the Internet
Online Summit: Focus on Children conference held here.
 
"That would certainly keep it away from children," said Goodlatte.
"I'm not advocating encryption to let pornography flourish."
 
Goodlatte, a champion of loosening encryption legislation, has
sponsored legislation to allow the export of encryption products and
another bill in the intellectual property arena, as well as another
bill increasing liability for those found guilty of running Internet
gambling operations.
 
Goodlatte was the afternoon speaker in place of Newt Gingrich, speaker
of the House, who couldn't attend.
 
In addition, Attorney General Janet Reno postponed her appearance
until Wednesday morning at 10:30.
 
Goodlatte took the opportunity to speak of the Clinton adminstration's
policy on encryption. "The Clinton administration's current encryption
policies are a severe hinderance on the development of the full
potential of the Internet," he said.
 
He also said the House Judiciary Committee will begin a review of the
Clinton administration's enforcement of laws on obscenity.
