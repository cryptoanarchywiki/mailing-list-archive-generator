  Yes, but Freeh is now positioning himself to be best pals with the
incoming Republican President.
  Would _you_ vote for a politician whom the FBI Director has implied
is part of a criminal tag-team that deserves investigation by a
special prosecutor? A politician whose previous running mate was
embroiled in WhiteWATER and FosterGATE at a time when hard evidence
that a former president was GUILTY in WATER-GATE is coming to the
fore?

"Vote for the manipulated public image of your choice, but vote."

  Our 'democracy' is run by Information Management Engineers. 

Or so I would have you believe...
