The Bureau 42 Remailer (remailer@bureau42.ml.org) is proud to announce
"Cycling for Freedom." Basically, this is a chance to help crack RC5/64 and
support the remailer system, and all the good it stands for.

Get the RC5/64 client from www.distributed.net, and follow the easy
instructions to configure it for your favorite computer.

Crack a few blocks, send 'em back to the server so that your personal address
shows up in the stats. On the stats page, you can ask the rc5 server to send
you a password that will allow you to join a team. Get that, and then ask to
join the team "rc5@bureau42.ml.org" (it's listed as team number 1626).

In the event this team finds the winning key, the money will be used for
upgrades and maintenance on the computer housing the bureau42 remailer.
(Specifically, a faster processor would be nice. After that, the rest of the
money will be put away and used to buy/maintain a dedicated connection for
that computer.) 

Thanks in advance for helping to support the remailer, and (more importantly)
helping crack RC5/64.

dave (bureau42 remailer administrator)
