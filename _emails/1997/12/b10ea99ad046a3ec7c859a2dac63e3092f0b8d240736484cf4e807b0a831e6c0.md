Note that if the library in question were not arm of the State,
noone would have any First Amendment claim.

This is reminiscent of TM's recent (controversial) analysis of the fired
county trashworker/author,
and suggests a clearer example of the confusion caused by State as Employer:

It is considered legal and moral for a *private employer* can use
censorware to restrict their LAN's access.
But if the employer is the State, and does this, the First might be dragged
in -confusing the issue,
since the government acting as State is constrained (by the constitution)
differently from the government
acting as Employer (constrained by employment law).

Perhaps some critical of Tim's analysis think that when government is
employer it can't censor its LAN?  Can't remove games from government owned
PCs?  

When the government removes games, pictures, etc. from its PCs it is acting
as a responsible efficient employer.
When the government attempts to remove games, pictures, etc. from stores it
is acting criminally.
