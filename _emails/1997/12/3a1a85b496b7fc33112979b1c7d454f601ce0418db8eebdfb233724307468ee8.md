G'day Jonathan,

	Could you please identify this "bank card company" by name, card,
nation, etc. ?

	Without some explicit cite of a commercial entity -- or a reference
to some "strip-'em-naked-with-electrons" Police R&D group like the guys at
Rome AFB -- this report sounds like another of those ID-Implant fantasies
circulated by the guys who are bolting steel plate to their screen doors
and programming their backyard AA to auto-target (a) Black Helicopters (b)
which are on low-level rapid approach (c) full Oriental, Arab, and Hispanic
troopers (c) wearing Blue Helmets.

	Got a single verifiable fact you could share?

	Or, with further checking, could you confirm that is this just
another spicy rumor crafted to keep the boyos in the hills rubbing garlic
into their hollow-points with proper militia enthusiasm?  (Not that I don't
enjoy a good tale to wake up sleepy Computer Science undergrads, mind
you...)

	Up the Revolution,

		              _Vin
