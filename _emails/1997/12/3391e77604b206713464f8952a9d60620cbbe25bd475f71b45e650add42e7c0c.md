The Anonymizer does in fact only provide restricted access by http and NO 
IRC.
For instance, the Anonymizer blocks Dejanews, Hotmail and mailto.cgi forms.
I could understand that they block sites that explicitly request to be 
blocked to prevent abuse.
But what if I want to make a mailto.cgi or IRC script available by http.
Should people be disallowed from accessing this through The Anonymizer 
even if I do not request it?
It should at least be possible to allow access to such scripts for The 
paid accounts.
If they keep logs in case of a U. S. law violation, I see no problem of 
liability arosing from such access.
They have also restricted their shell access for which you pay US $ 7 per 
moth to IRC.
Does that sound more reasonable than blocking the nntp port?
Does anyone know other ISPs who provide privacy and do not block 
abitrarily without _prior request_ from the site in question?
A private interest can do anything, but anyway.
