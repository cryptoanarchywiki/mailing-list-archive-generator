That would be a "hate crime". According to a message in the cypherpunks
mailing list (which I unfortunately deleted, with references to more
details on some websites), there was a conference on "hate crimes"
recently. There, they discussed "profiles" and signs of "hate crimes",
and among signs there were discussions of the constitution and founding
fathers.

If someone has any more information on that, please let us know.
