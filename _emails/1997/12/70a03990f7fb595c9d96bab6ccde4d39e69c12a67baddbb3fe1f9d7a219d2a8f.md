Pasting those in isn't controversial, and is generally supported;
you could be using Subject: pasting today with most remailers,
using the ## syntax.

>(I would like to see Cc: and Bcc: being allowed to be pasted in also).
At minimum, addresses in Cc: and Bcc: need to be checked against
blocking lists, and it's probably worth checking the number of
names in the list against some threshold - especialy Bcc:s,
which tend to be popularly used by spamware.

Too easy to be abused by forgers, as are Reply-To: and Sender:.

MSMail and other closed systems are generally quite arrogant
about only showing you the mail headers they "know" you want to see,
and discarding the rest, whether that's what you want or not.
Lots of mail clients only show you one From:, either discarding 
others or making them available in a "Show all headers" mode.

Which is a bit annoying, by the way, for cypherpunks who don't
want to read your mail :-)  On the other hand, alt.anonymous.messages
is a fine place for people to send replies, and you can do things like
	alt.anonymous.messages@mail2news.some-relay-server.com
At one time, there was a message-pool service on the extropia remailer
which forwarded anything retrieved to all its subscribers;
if the list is small it's not much protection, but it's one way
to obscure mail sent to middleman remailers.

There are other remailer-like systems that provide mailboxes
for anonymous retrieval; I think Jenaer does something like that.
And then of course there are hotmail and juno :-)
