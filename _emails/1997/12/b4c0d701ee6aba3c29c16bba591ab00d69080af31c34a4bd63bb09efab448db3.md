Hi,

   I'm Lori. My girlfriends and I have created this way cool site.
We would love you to check it out.

Love,                                                                              
    Lori


P.S.  Being new to this, we were told that if you NEVER want to hear from us
again, reply with the subject "Remove" and you won't.  That would make us
really sad though.
