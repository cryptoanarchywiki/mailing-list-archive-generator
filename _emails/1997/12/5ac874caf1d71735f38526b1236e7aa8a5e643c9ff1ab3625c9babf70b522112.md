Old press release from McAfee boasting Key Recovery Alliance
membership:

    MCAFEE JOINS KEY RECOVERY ALLIANCE; MULTI-VENDOR GROUP TO
    CREATE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR RECOVERY OF ENCRYPTION
                                     KEYS

    Key Recovery Alliance to Develop Solutions Which Balance
    the Needs of End- Users, Employers, and International
    Governments

    SANTA CLARA, CALIF. (December 12, 1996) -- McAfee (Nasdaq:
    MCAF), a leading vendor of network security and management
    software, today announced that it has joined the Key
    Recovery Alliance, a coalition of encryption software
    vendors who have joined together to promote international
    specifications for encrypted information. "As a member of
    the Alliance, McAfee will work to create an internationally
    recognized and widely available standard for trusted key
    recovery," said Dan Freedman, vice president of security
    products at McAfee. "Trusted key recovery enables the
    responsible deployment of encryption technologies
    worldwide, while addressing the valid interests and
    security requirements of end-users, employers, and
    government."

    McAfee recently extended its family of network security
    products with the introduction of three new encryption
    solutions. These solutions include PCCrypto for encryption
    of desktop computer files and electronic mail; WebCrypto
    for the encryption of Internet email; and NetCrypto for
    transparent encryption of all communications over TCP/IP
    networks such as corporate intranets and the Internet.

    The Key Recovery Alliance was formed in October, and is
    composed of approximately 40 different network security
    vendors who have joined to cooperate on the development and
    promotion of internationally-accepted standards for
    encryption key recovery. Encryption keys are the codes that
    unlock encrypted information. Encryption key recovery
    refers to the necessary ability to recover lost or damaged
    encryption keys. Common situations in which encryption key
    recovery would be needed include when the death or
    departure of an employee who maintained mission-critical
    encrypted information causes the encryption key to be lost;
    when an encryption key becomes damaged due to a hard disk
    crash; or when a court order warrants the decryption of
    computer-based evidence.

    Company Background
