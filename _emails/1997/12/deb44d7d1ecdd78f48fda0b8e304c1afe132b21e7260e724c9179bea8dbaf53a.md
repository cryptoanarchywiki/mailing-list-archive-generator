Introduction to Metaphysics and Sein und Zeit do concern the relationship
between what is real (what exists) and subjective, perceptual reality,
but Heidegger makes clear that although what we know is only perception,
perception is not the essent of what is real and exists. Actions must 
rely on perception of reality, but he lends not absolute validity to the
perceptions.

Heidegger was on the right track, though quantum and cosmological physics
and cognitive sciences reach beyond his philosophical circles of contra-
diction and paradox inside a flawed and entirely limited language into an
expanding and increasingly accurate scientific and mathematical system of
discourse. His basic mistake was to admit that verbal and written language
contains contradictions and then to draw what he supposed were valid
conclusions -- from false premesis and a false universe of discourse.

Yup.
