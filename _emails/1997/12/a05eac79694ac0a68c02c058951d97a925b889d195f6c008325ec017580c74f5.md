There's an important distinction between a requirement that you identify
yourself accurately, and a requirement that you carry a particular form of
identification. It is constitutional for the police to ask you what your
name is, under certain circumstances - and you can face criminal charges if
you lie. It is not, however, constitutional to require that you keep or
carry identity cards or documents. (Modulo, of course, participation in
activities like carrying a concealed weapon or driving. There are some
people who believe that carrying special credentials should not be required
when undertaking those activities, but very few or none of those people sit
as judges, so their beliefs are comforting or pleasing but also
insufficient to prevent conviction.)
