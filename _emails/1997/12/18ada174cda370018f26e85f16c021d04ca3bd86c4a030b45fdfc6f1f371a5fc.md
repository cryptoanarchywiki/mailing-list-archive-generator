Damn tooting, Jim, my babe is sweetest licking and being his
love slave is a pleasure. And for it, I eagerly forego morality,
ethics, empathy, justice and liberty along with constitutional and
biblical protection. Babe's my blackhearted PO, with two years 
to release.

Damn, Jim, have you never lost it all where every which 
way was up?

If not, then you don't know shit about Jim's situation, or mine,
sweetheart, and whose balls you'll lick to get back to zero, not even 
hoping you'll get back to where you were before insane vanity took 
you and those who trusted you over the edge to irreversible loss 
and despair.

Sorry to say that "Constitutional protections" might do that to you,
Jim, for they are sometimes finger-licking nose-candy, bad shit 
that's pushed by a nasty gang of predators as morality, ethics, 
empathy, justice and liberty along with biblical protection. They, 
and other holy writs, have got a lot of innocents wasted for addictive 
righteousness of hustlers who use perfect grammar to hide evil.

Just kidding, son, you're okay, don't EMR me. Zap my literary 
inchoate.
