I'm kind-of skeptical of the big advantages of this.  I mean, if you
were convinced
someone with a DES-cracking engine was listening in on an encrypted
channel, 
and you really wanted to make sure they wouldn't manage to get any
plaintext, would
you rather alter your system to use some weird and not-too-well
analyzed chaining
mode, or alter your system to use DESX or Blowfish or something else
with a 
key length too big to be vulnerable to such keysearch machines? 
There clearly *are*
ways to get more than 56 bits of security out of DES.  However,
they're not generally
obvious, and even very bright cryptographers have shot themselves in
the foot trying
to design them.  (Remember 3DES with internal CBC-mode chaining,
Ladder DES, and
DES-Tran-DES-Tran-DES?)
