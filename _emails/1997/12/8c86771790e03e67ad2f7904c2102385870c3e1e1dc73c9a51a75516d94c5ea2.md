   It may indeed serve that purpose, but the patch does serve as a
sealant and when set up with the right lubricant it cleans the bore on
the way out. This gave birth to the expression "one shot clean" - done
right the bore is more or less always dirty from the last shot only as
that shot cleaned the residue of the prior shot out by it lubricated
patch. Civil war era muskets and later used a Minie ball, which was no
ball at all but a tapered projectile which had no patching at all,
just 5-700 grains (for a 58 cal musket, lighter for .45 and .50) of
pure soft lead with a dab of lubricant in the hollowed base.

 Quite right, but there's one more caveat you forgot here, Jim, when
using the rod to tamp the ball down, its done with one hand with the
rod held between two fingers. You sort of 'throw' the rod down onto
the bullet, actually letting go, never holding the rod firmly and
*never* putting your hand on top of the rod to push it down. (I saw
one guy get a rod from a 58 cal three band Enfield shot through his
hand at a musket shoot once and more than a few rods shot through
rooves or into roof timbers in the shooting sheds or several hundred
feet through the air on open ranges)

Friction isn't the only source of stray ignition, powder embers from a
prior shot when doing rapid fire shooting has been a common culprit.
We had one musket shoot on a god awful hot sunny summer day and by the
sixth and seventh rapid fire shots in the midday shooting the muskets
were hot enough to cook off powder when combined with a little bit too
forceful tamping, we had to curtail shooting til later in the day.

All in all, the guys who had to use muzzle-loading weapons in war,
personal defense, and hunting had to have been an adventuresome lot,
todays weapons are boring in comparison.
