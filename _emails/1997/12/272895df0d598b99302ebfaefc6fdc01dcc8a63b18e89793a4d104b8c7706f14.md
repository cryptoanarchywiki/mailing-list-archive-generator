	Now that I've posted that operating a mail2news gateway is a
minimal effort, the m2n at jpunix.com has been under a steady spam attack
for the past 72 hours. I fought it all day yesterday and came in this
morning to find that the spammer had just moved to a different ISP and
started spamming again. I have no choice but to shut down the m2n for now
in order to stop the spam. If anyone is interested the body of the spam
looks like this:

Subject: Publicity agents are fun!

Hoping you'll have a superly-NICE
nite, a FUN day tomorrow, and the
most excellent TIMES forever more.

	Of course everyone on USEnet is blaming jpunix.com for the SPAM
but I knew that would happen when I first started the m2n. Anyway here's
hoping that the spammer will get tired and move on and then I'll be able
to start it back up.
