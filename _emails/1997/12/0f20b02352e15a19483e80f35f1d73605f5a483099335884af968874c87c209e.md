Really? Where is that in the Constitution? I can't sue a state or the
federal government on an issue of process or procedure unless I *personaly*
have been effected? Malarky. The simple fact that I am a citizen that
*could* be effected is sufficient grounds to file. Especialy considering the
detailing of authority in the 10th.

If this were so I would not be able to file against a law regulating, for
example, a religion unless I happen to be a participant of that religion.
This is clearly not constitutional since any law threating a single
religion by extension can and does threaten all religious freedom in the
country.

Why? If both states are participating in an illegal action - such as
complying with unconstitutional federal regulations - then even a single
state in which I *don't* reside nor have *ever* been in is a clear threat to
my constitutional rights.  Remember the feds are *required* to guarantee a
constitutional government in *all* states and that all priviliges and
immunitites be recognized by those states - irrespective of my current
geographic location. Now if we accept the argument that the 14th extends my
federal rights to the states then the wrongful action and its application is
even more clearly relevant. However, the 14th is not necessary for this to
be the case.

(thankfuly, since one of my claims is that rights are not equivalent to
priviliges or immunities)

It is the precedence and not the personal application that is
unconstitutional.

- Illegal taxation and the compliance of the states in turning over money
  illegaly

- regulation and prohibition of firearms and the states complicancy
  in breaking the 2nd.

- the provisioning and support of military operations relating to the
  Army and Air Force (which is unconstitutional unless part of the Army
  or Navy) for more than 2 year terms.

- the failure of the US govt. to train and arm the militia in the several
  states

- the various federal regulations limiting consensual crimes contrary
  to the letter and spirit of the 9th and 10th.

- the abrogation of the states duties as equals to the federal govt.
  and their duties as a part of the checks and balances of the
  Constitution.

And as a matter of course most other issues resting on Constitutional
jurisdiction involving the willing compliance of state government.

Nobody that I can find has *ever* even tried to do this so how can it be
undoable? It's a pity there wasn't some young turk back then to give it a
shot - course there doesn't seem to be any young turks now willing to do it
either...;(

Now, if I can figure a way around the Supreme Courts 3 year requirement...
