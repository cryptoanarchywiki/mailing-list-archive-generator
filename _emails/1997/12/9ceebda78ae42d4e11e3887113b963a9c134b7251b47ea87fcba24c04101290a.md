>From a news.com feature:	
	
        Sometimes, Daufenbach notes, a freshly arrested child
	pornographer facing a long sentence will agree to
	let his email account "hum" (continue running), with
	Customs picking up the traffic. A year ago,
	Daufenbach assumed the identity behind one such
	account. A molester and child pornographer
	(Daufenbach declined to reveal the person's name)
	began emailing Daufenbach's undercover account and
	then switched to real-time online chat, one of the
	biggest challenges for any cyberinvestigator. "A lot
	of people don't like doing it," says the Customs
	agent. "You have to think on your feet."

        Molesters often talk graphically about the children
	they abuse--and expect the same from their
	confidants. "If you get nervous and flustered,"
	notes Daufenbach, "you'll blow it."
