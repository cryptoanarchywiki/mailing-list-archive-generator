The general pressure to treat pay phones as things to be regulated away, to
be forcefully shut down (as in Chicago, if I recall correctly), and to be
treated as a Tool of the Devil has to do with the War on Some Drugs, of
course.

Because dealers use pay phones, they must be bad.

In a free society, companies would be free to offer various kinds of
blocking services. I surmise, though, that the pager companies are under
pressure from their friends in government to block pay phones more so than
they normally would.

(Even the _ability_ to block a pay phone, qua pay phone, must imply that
pay phones send out some kind of signal announcing themselves as pay
phones, which I had not heard of before. I assumed a pay phone was Just
Another Phone Number.)


The Feds have shown their hand: they want a ban on domestic cryptography
