Check the archives.  There was plenty of discussion when it happened.

I'm convinced they used names pulled out of Bell's computer, not a
cypherpunks subscriber list as they sent my copy of the SPAM to an
email address that had long been retired at the time of the mailing,
but had been used to exchange email with Jim.  Far more active list
members than I didn't get a copy.

They did, and we were.  Here's a copy of one message I saved:

If those headers are forged, it is an expert forgery.

The MX hosts for the net.insp.irs.gov domain are fun:
net.insp.irs.gov        preference = 10, mail exchanger = tcs-gateway2.treas.gov
net.insp.irs.gov        preference = 20, mail exchanger = tcs-gateway1.treas.gov
net.insp.irs.gov        preference = 30, mail exchanger = gotcha.treas.gov
irs.gov nameserver = gotcha.treas.gov
irs.gov nameserver = nis.ans.net
irs.gov nameserver = ns.ans.net
tcs-gateway2.treas.gov  internet address = 204.151.246.2
tcs-gateway1.treas.gov  internet address = 204.151.245.2
gotcha.treas.gov        internet address = 204.151.246.80

`gotcha.treas.gov'?  It's a real host connected through ans.net ...

Except for hop 16, this is the same traceroute as to
tcs-gateway2.treas.gov.  For what it's worth, the traceroute to
tcs-gateway1 is slightly different:
