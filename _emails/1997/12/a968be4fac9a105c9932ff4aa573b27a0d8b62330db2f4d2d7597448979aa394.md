I've said all of this before myself, and still people want it. So there
will be two safeguards which should prevent the aforementioned problems:

1) The From: address on USENET posts will be mangled a la mail2news_nospam
to prevent spam baiting. Most of the posts I see with pasted From: lines
(from replay, in alt.privacy.anon-server) use a fake address and aren't
trying to impersonate anyone. 

2) Whenever a From: line is pasted, a disclaimer will be inserted at the
top of the body, stating that the original sender has set the From: line,
and that the identification cannot be verified. The fact that it is up at
the top of the body should mean people should actually see it before
reacting.

3) As someone else has suggested, it does indeed insert a Sender: header
with the remailer's address.

Two basic points also about "forgeries". First, you can forge headers
pretty easily without any programs other than telnet. Second, if this
actually does become misused frequently, all I need to do is delete one
character from one file (a # in headers.del) and it will be disabled. I
consider this an experimental feature, and if it doesn't work out, I'll
just turn it back off.
