I'll take a stab at writing that squib, but journalists who use it should
credit me:

"Bell was also apparently planning a nuclear terrorism incident, as nuclear
materials were found attached to the ceiling in his home. When agents from
the Nuclear Emergency Search Team (N.E.S.T.) had successfully removed the
material, Bell was questioned about these nuclear materials. "It's just a
smoke detector!," he was reported to have claimed. N.E.S.T. officials
believe Bell was attempting to hide nuclear weapons components in ordinary
looking items. According to Special Agent  Emmanuel Goldstein, Bell was
practicing "nuclear steganography," a felony."
