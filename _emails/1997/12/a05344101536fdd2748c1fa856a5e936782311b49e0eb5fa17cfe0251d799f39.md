I keep seeing periodic announcements for crypto-related gatherings in various
metro-areas in other parts of the country.  I haven't noticed any from Phoenix
(nor the rest of Arizona) so, I thought I'd take it apon myself to take a CFIL.
If (say) 10 people respond, I'll begin organizing a periodic get-together, along
the lines of what some other localities have already done.

Note to other organizers: I'd appreciate helpful hints on how to make things 
work.  I'm more of a techie than a socialite, and don't understand all of the 
niceties of getting people together, finding cheap laces to meat, and finding
people willing to get up in front of a crowd and talk, much less getting people
that don't know each other to talk to each other.

Prospective participants: Please respond with at least general coordinates for
your preferred meeting place, and your preferred days/dates/times for meeting.

I'd _really_ like to see this get off of the ground.  I _know_ that Phoenix/AZ
has enough high-tech/security-interested people to get things going.  I'll be 
really dissapointed in my home-state if I can't get at least 10 responses.

P.S. If there is strong objection to the distribution list that I am currently
using, I apologize.  The initial announcement was meant to reach as many people
interested in cryptography located in PHX/AZ as possible.  Future announcements
will probably be sent to a new majordomo list and other selected lists, as 
appropriate.  (List managers: If you don't appreciate my efforts, please let me
know.)

P.P.S.  If your MUA doesn't honor Reply-to: headers, please CC: 
sgibbo@amex-trs.com for a prompt response.
