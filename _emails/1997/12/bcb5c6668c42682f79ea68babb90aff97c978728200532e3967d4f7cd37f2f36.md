Sure, anyone can generate a PGP key.  It's almost as easy as generating a
throwaway e-mail address.  And what does posting from a certain e-mail address
or signing one's post with a certain PGP key prove?  It proves that the poster
KNEW a certain piece of INFORMATION, either an account password or a PGP
secret key.  It's usually inferred that the person who possesses that
information is the person who generated it.  Of the two, guessing a PGP
secret key is orders of magnitude harder than guessing someone's password,
logging on, and impersonating them.

In addition, PGP signing is "portable".  No matter where I post from, if I
sign my post with the same key, you can assume it's me who posted it.  It's 
more difficult to do that with an e-mail address.  Let's say that you have a
common name like "John Smith" and you post as jsmith@someisp.com.  Are you
saying that's your "identity"?  What if Someisp, Inc. suddenly files for
bankruptcy and shuts down without warning?  Did you lose your identity?

You could open a new account as "jsmith" somewhere else and claim you are
the same person who previously posted as jsmith@someisp.com, but so could
anyone else who desired to impersonate you.  If you were signing your posts
with a PGP key, then all you'd have to do is make a post from your new ISP,
sign it with the same key, and your "identity" is "transferred".
