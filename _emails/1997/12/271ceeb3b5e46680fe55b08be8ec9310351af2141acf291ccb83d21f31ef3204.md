Am I the only one to notice that traffic has dropped from about 100 
messages/day to only a few?  Does anyone know what is broken?
Does anyone care?  Is the whole c-p list a giant MITM being run 
against a very few of us who are the only human participants?

Oh dear!  I just realized that c-p _could_ be subject to an interesting 
MITM attack:  By subtlely modifiying the text of c-p messages arriving 
at certain key recipients, the bad guys could then correlate the quoted 
text in resulting anonymous replies to the list with individuals, and
could probably also shave a layer or two off the remailer chains 
through which those messages were sent.  The determination of 
individual's usage patterns of remailers would also benefit from this, 
and the info would go into a growing database which could then be used 
at some point down the road to nail key people and remove them as 
irritants and agitators.

Isn't it odd that many key contributors to the list coincidentally 
live near nondescript neighborhood houses that bristle with
antennae and are regularly visited by black helicopters and large 
unmarked vans?  No, I didn't think so either.  That's probably an 
unrelated operation.
