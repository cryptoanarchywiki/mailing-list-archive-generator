Everyone should keep in mind that John McAfee very well knows on which side
of his bread it is buttered--  McAfee has made his fortune on the
site-licenses for government use of his anti-virus product.  U.S. Customs
alone liceneses 17,000+ copies.  Is anyone kidding themselves about which
side of GAK and Key Escrow McAfee will come down on?  I have never bought
into any of the conspiranauts BS about PGP backdoors as long as PZ was
involved with it but I will certainly assume it is to be a "given" with PGP
in the hands of McAfee.
