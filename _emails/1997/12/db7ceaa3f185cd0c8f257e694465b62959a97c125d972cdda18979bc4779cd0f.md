PR Newswire, December 17, 1997:

Los Angeles -- IBM telephoned Meganet Corporation ten days ago 
after reviewing the Virtual Matrix Encryption (VME) algorithm and 
highly recommended the VME technology to be the national 
standard for data encryption, reported Meganet. The IBM
spokesperson from the Security Technology Division requested 
immediate submission of VME to the National Institute of Standards 
& Technology and the Institute of Electrical & Electronic Engineers to 
facilitate the standardization. Obviously, Meganet's claim that their 
VME technology is completely impenetrable has garnered much 
support.
