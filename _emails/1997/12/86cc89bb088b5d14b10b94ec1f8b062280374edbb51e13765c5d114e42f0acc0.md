Or both of them, actually (NJ...)

On a previous (shorter) stay in the US, I didn't have a SSN. Yet I got a
DL (with my passport) (this was Missouri). And after a few long
discussions on the phone on why I didn't have a SSN, I gave up the
explanations and started giving my french SSN (after all, it was a valid
answer to the question "what is your social security number"), actually
a substring. Interestly enough, SSNs in France are not supposed to be
used for identification or taxes purposes, just for medical purposes
IIRC. A recent project by the government to link medical databases and
tax database opened a controversial discussion...
