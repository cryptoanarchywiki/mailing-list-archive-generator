I thought it was time someone totally unbiased commented
on this OS war thing!

We buy computers ordered with blank disks in preference.  In fact this
one came with DOS and I wiped it on day 1.

Red Hat's Applixware has had good reviews.  Besides I'm happy to return
unreadable messages asking for a different format.  If the other guy
refuses try him with DVI or something.   It's different if you're being
paid to use Windoze. I'll admit it - I did some Lose95 work today: what
was it ?  Trying to get a modem link to stay up.  I've done more creative
things, but not usually under Windoze.

Quote her the exec format error you got.  Ha ha ha.

But you should soon find out from other people.

GUI interfaces are only easy for the few things they present
you with, after which they are imnpossible.  Unless you can
connect your "find" and "sed" icons in a pipeline ...
In fact I rarely even start X unless it's for the xboard chess game.

speaking of which ...
   Is Unix dying--or even dead?

    From Edupage, 18 December 1997:
    <---------->
    TACTICAL SHIFT BY WORKSTATION COMPANIES
    Silicon Graphics Inc.'s plan to allow SGI graphics software to run on
    Microsoft's Windows NT operating system provides new evidence that a
    growing number of companies are giving up on Unix and instead
    standardizing on Windows NT.  SGI hopes to be able to use its
    experience in developing high-end graphics software without having to
    spend a great deal of time building the underlying technology
    represented by an operating system. (Washington Post  17 Dec 97)
    <---------->

But SGI never did put any effort into it, which was why their network
programs were built on 'rcp' and needed fixing if you (horrors) set a password.

I can think of someone possibly suitable for this last bit.
(R. what do you think ?)

Try these people.  I'm not sure about laptops.
