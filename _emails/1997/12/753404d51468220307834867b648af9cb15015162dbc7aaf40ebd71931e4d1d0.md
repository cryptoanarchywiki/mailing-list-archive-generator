PGP signing a post is a lot like the new anti-counterfeiting measures in US
currency, only a lot more effective.  But if some bozo decides to start printing
up three dollar bills with a portrait of Mickey Mouse, and others are
foolish enough to accept them, what are you going to do?  It's hard to protect
people from their own stupidity.  I'd contend that a $3 bill isn't even a
counterfeit or forgery, since there is not genuine equivalent which it seeks to
fraudulently duplicate.

Maybe it's time that the brain-dead software that mindlessly harvests e-mail
addresses from the net was shut down.  That sounds like the real problem.

I'm not sure what comment you intended to make about that paragraph, since it
appears that you inadvertantly pasted in your comment from the last paragraph
again.  The text you're supposedly commenting on nowhere mentions PGP.

Since you've already found a solution to the problem that works, there seems
to be no need to do anything more drastic to solve it.

For one thing, to identify posts as originating from one's pseudonym, which 
*MIGHT* be a "real" e-mail address.  Most times I've seen it used, though, it has 
been used to place identifying information in the From: field which many newsreaders 
use to identify posts so that they are recognizeable by the reader.

The key word there is "caught", and then you'd have to convince Netcom to actually
do something about it.  It is my understanding that spammers routinely utilize
Netcom's OPEN SMTP SERVERS to send out their spam, using whatever From: field they
wish, and Netcom doesn't seem to care.  Anyone using those same servers to send mail 
to a mail2news gateway could forge someone's name and e-mail address to a Usenet post, 
couldn't they?

Also, even if a complaint to Netcom got an individual account shut down, that wouldn't
stop some other Netcom user from doing the same thing, nor would it stop the first
Netcom user from opening another account under a phony name and repeating the
process, or even doing it from a non-Netcom account.  So if my e-mail address were
being forged via Netcom, would they be able to source-block it as the remailers
currently can do?  If not, doesn't your own ISP have a bigger abuse potential than the
remailer net?
 
> AGAIN  IT'S NOT FORGERY  THAT'S A PROBLEM. IT'S UCE BAITING. 
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There's no need to shout.  Perhaps you've forgotten two earlier posts you made to
this NG in the past couple of weeks in which you said:

-> Subject: Re: Controlling the From: line in PIdaho
-> 
-> Hopefully replay has corrected this as others have suggested so that the above
-> CAN'T be done.  It's a simple way to forge someone else's name.  Early last
                                        ^^^^^
-> year comes to mind.
->
-> [...]
->      
-> Posting anonymously is a valid thing to do, posting with someone else's name
-> in the From line is simply forgery.   Try sending your message from a hotmail
                              ^^^^^^^
-> address or other site where you can just make up a name if you want this sort
-> of thing.

And in another post:

-> Subject: Re: 'from' other than anonymous
-> 
-> [...]
-> 
-> Again, a forged from line (Forged as in someone's _REAL_ email address shows
            ^^^^^^            ^^^^^^
-> up) is a BAD THING.

You claimed to be concerned about FORGERY back then, now you're saying "IT'S NOT 
FORGERY THAT'S A PROBLEM".  Which is the case?
 
> AGAIN. Please specify how PGP signing a post will stop UCE Baiting based soley
> on the from line.

But you were given two solutions, so if one of them works, then you don't need the
other one.
