At the same time Janet Reno makes these proposals, the
U.S. government, and this administration particularly, has done
everything in its power to undermine the development and deployment of
security enhancing technologies.

Not only has the use of cryptography been greatly hampered, but
TEMPEST equipment and knowledge is controlled, and there have even
been proposals to control secure operating systems.

Reno's statements and the administration's policies blatantly
contradict each other.  The very technologies which would solve the
problem Reno raises are being discouraged at every opportunity by the
administration she represents.

My question is directed at Declan because he is handy, but any other
reporters are invited to contribute.  Why is this not reported
accurately?  Do you plan to write a story which explains to the
American people how the administration is not telling the truth?  If
not, why not?  Surely it is important for the American people to
understand what their leaders say and do.
