>      CHINO, California (CNN) -- An Internet business group and the
>      world's biggest Internet service provider, America Online, were
>      poised Wednesday for a legal showdown in a dispute over pitching
>      products and services to AOL users via e-mail.
>      
>      If AOL doesn't back down from its opposition to the National
>      Organization of Internet Commerce (NOIC), the California-based group
>      threatens to put the e-mail addresses of millions of AOL users on
>      its Web site, making them available for downloading by any business,
>      group or individual seeking to make mass electronic mailing
>      
>      NOIC, a non-profit trade organization representing small businesses
>      and bulk-mailers, originally set Thursday as the day it would reveal
>      the e-mail addresses of 1 million of AOL's 10 million customers.
>      
>      On Wednesday, however, NOIC escalated the threat, announcing it
>      would release 5 million AOL e-mail addresses on January 8.
>      
>      AOL vowed to fight NOIC in court, if necessary, and said it hoped
>      the group would reconsider.
