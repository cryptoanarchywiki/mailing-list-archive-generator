You're far too kind, Adam.

This fool who sometimes posts as Toto, sometimes as TruthMonger, sometimes
as Human Gus-Peter, sometimes as Admiral Bubba Something, and so on, is
simply set on disrupting the list.

I long ago started deleting his stuff unread, or as soon as I saw it was
from "Colonel Parker" or "A Player to be Named Later," or whatever. The
guy, whomever he is, probably has some real writing skills, but they've
been lost in what I have to presume is a bourbon fog.

His stuff took me far too long to download this morning at 2:30 a.m., and
then more of this shit this morning. All to just have it all deleted.

Please, Toto or Whomever, knock it off.
