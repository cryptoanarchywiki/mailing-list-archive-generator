Dear Mogul...

Why buy tickets to THE LIFE?, Cy Coleman's 
brilliantly evocative new musical?

BECAUSE:

1. THE LIFE won a truck-load of BEST MUSICAL awards.

2  The women in the cast are universally regarded as
the most dazzling and talented on Broadway.

3.  There's Friendship, Love, Betrayal, Heartache, Greed, 
and Sacrifice... And that's only in the first 20 minutes.

4.  Vincent Canby (New York Times) said the show was
"the best musical of the season."
(And he knows what he's talking about.)

5.  Newsweek Magazine said the musical 
was a "masterpiece."
(And they know what they're talking about.)

6.  Joey McKneely's choreography smolders
in its own sensuality.

7.  Lillias White blows the roof off the theatre
TWICE in Act I.
(That's why they gave her the Tony Award.)

8.  In-Theatre Magazine says that "Chuck Cooper is
so intimidating as the pimp, Memphis, that even tough
guys in the audience have been known to recoil in fear."
(And that's why they gave him the Tony Award.)

9.  At the end... the audience stands up, goes nuts,
and generally carries on like it's never seen a musical.
(One guy stood on his chair one night and tried to
recreate the choreography.)

10.  There are DISCOUNT TICKETS January 5th
through February 12th.

ORDER BY PHONE:  Call TELE-CHARGE at
(212) 947-8844 (8 AM - Midnight) or
outside Metro New York call (800) 432-7250.
MENTION THE CODE: "TLDM".



THE LIFE.
At the Barrymore Theatre.
The best show on Broadway.

Bye.

All Seats: $50 (Orch. and Front Mezz.)
All Seats: $40 (Rear Mezz.)
Offer good for Monday through Thursday shows at 8 PM,
January 5th through February 12th, 1998.
Tickets must be ordered by January 11th, 1998.
