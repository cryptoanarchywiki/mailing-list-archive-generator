Myer's code and cipher disk (with illustration) are briefly described
in Fred Wrixon's "Codes and Ciphers" along with an entry on
Civil War crypto with a photo of a Confederate cipher disk.

We've put the entries and illustrations at:

   http://jya.com/cydisk.htm

The book is:

   "Codes and Ciphers: An A to Z of Covert Communication, 
   from the Clay Tablet to the Microdot,"
   Fred B. Wrixon, Prentice Hall, 1992, paper. $18.00 
   ISBN 0-13-277047-4
