 Hot enough to burn exposed skin, but not enough for problems. I think
had I gotten up to seven or eight magazines one after another there
may have been danger of cooking off rounds or even barrel warp. I saw
a an M-2 50 on a Chinook get a barrel warp after 1000 straight rounds
... first the barrel was glowing cherry red in broad daylight then as
it cooled it warped enough that the gunner took it out of action ...
fortunately by that time we had gotten off the ground and were well
airborne on our way back to Danang (hmmmmmm, makes me think, nuthin
good ever did happen out near Thuong Duc and Charlie Ridge!)
