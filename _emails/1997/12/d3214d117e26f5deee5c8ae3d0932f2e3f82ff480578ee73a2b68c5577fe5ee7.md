This is why I started using Windows 3.0 along with the MKS Toolkit Shell
back when.  Sometimes a CLI interface is the right tool -- sometimes a
GUI is the right tool.  It especially seems the case that graphical
activities (like word processing (vs. text editing)) gain much from a
GUI interface.  I also have several CLI utilities for manipulating GUI
objects (believe it or not, you can't tell Exchange Mail Client to use
'>' (or any other) as the reply character).

Nowadays, I run NT 4.0 with an MKS Toolkit Korn Shell loaded at startup
as one of my apps.  (Microsoft missed a chance when they didn't license
MKS Toolkit for NT 4.0 and Windows 95.)

The "ctrl-alt-meta-cokebottle" syndrome was a major pain, one I was glad
to separate myself from.

Probably why I like styles in Word so much...

Although Windows NT 4.0 is around the quality of Unix circa 1981 or so,
that still makes it much superior to any other Microsoft OS.  With the
MKS Toolkit implementation of the Korn Shell + other Unix utilities, and
a recent version of Perl (5.004 or later), I don't feel like I'm
underpowered on NT 4.0 relative to when I work on a Sun under Solaris
2.5.

How true.  Although the quality of Windows NT 4.0 is not up to what I
get under Solaris or HP-UX, I can use my machine as a light-duty
production server as well as a workstation.  It is good enough for me to
be able to concentrate on the hard work of creating quality prose and
programs.
