I think Peter's point was that most of the Germans who are calling for
the abolition of the hate laws _are_ the hate groups, rather than
civil liberties groups.  Sure, there are a few Germans who think that
free speech and assembly should mean free speech and assembly,
and aren't part of hate groups, but the government isn't out persecuting them
so they've got less incentive to make noise about it.
Also, the folks with pure motives are arguing a pure issue,
while the hatemongers get to combine their calls for the abolition of
hate laws with calls for the expulsion of non-Aryans, use it for recruiting,
and use it as a defense of their position.

Certainly had a lot to do with kids becoming lefties in the 60s.
