I see the list as a place to discuss ideas rather than as a propaganda
vehicle or a political party.

Next you'll be telling us we should not obediently follow his every
command!  Whose side are you on?

You might be happier if you did not associate with a group of weak and
childish individuals.

I have no doubt that Tim May contradicts himself from time to time.
And, when he changes his mind he does not announce it to the list and
carefully credit each person who influenced his views.  Sometimes he
is insensitive or even rude ("chop chop").  I've never seen him
apologize, either.  Probably he doesn't have the circuits to do it.

But, so what?  He's still the most interesting contributor to the
list.  I can well understand why you don't put him in your killfile.

Perhaps instead of name calling, you should actually address a point
or two and discuss it.  If you think McVeigh did the wrong thing, it
would be interesting to hear why.  And it would interesting to hear
why you believe that a McVeigh killing innocents is wrong, but a
U.S. Air Force doing the same thing is right.
