It seems to me that the purpose of a remailer is to strip the headers,
including the FROM header, not to put in fake headers.  Until someone can
explain it to me, I'd consider the idea of adding a FROM header to
anonymous mail to be asinine.

Best I can tell, the only reasonable good purpose for this is to create a
persistent nym identity without a reply to capability.  Well, remailer
software cannot support everything I suppose. (Even if Cracker may
apparently support this)

I would think the best way to put in a persistent nym capability would be
to database the PGP key id's along with the persistent identity.  Then the
remailer could produce lines like

	From: "Monty Cantsin" <anon@anon.efga.org>

Persistent identities would be created by sending a signed PGP message that
includes both the PGP public key and the persistent identity.  Since the
identity server would not database email addresses, only PGP key id's, and
only work for signed messages, there should be no problem with people
worrying about the remailer being compromised.  This also keeps someone
from stealing another's reputation capital.
