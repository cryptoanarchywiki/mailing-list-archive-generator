This article touches on several Cypherpunks themes and technologies,
including: use of anonymous remailers, mandatory Web content filters, bans
on encryption, and bomb-making instructions.

True, the persons being affected here are prisoners and parolees, and
prisoners obviously are lacking certain civil liberties. Parollees, too.
(Whether those convicted of felonies or even lesser crimes should be
denied civil liberties after their sentence has been completed is a
troubling issue I won't get into right now.)

But as more and more things are declared criminal, and as selective
prosecution is becoming the norm, these increasing restrictions may affect
a larger fraction of the population.

And, I think, the attitude here toward paroled convicts gives us some
hints about the application of the Four Horsemen arguments in general.
