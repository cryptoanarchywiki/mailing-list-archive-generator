House Rep. Arrested on Morals Charge

Rep. Bob Goodlatte was arrested today for selling PGP at a local
schoolyard.  "Since there has been so much scrutiny on election
contributions, we have to get cash however we can." Rep. Goodlatte said.
It is not known how much money was raised by Rep. Goodlatte in this
fashion.  An unknown accomplice known only as "Truthmonger" is sought by
the Justice Department in regards to this incident.

In other news, Rep. Goodlatte faces a trademark suit from the Starbucks
corporation over his name.  "Goodlatte is associated solely with our
company.  Therefore the use of that name violates our intellectual property
rights.", said a Starbucks Spokesperson.
