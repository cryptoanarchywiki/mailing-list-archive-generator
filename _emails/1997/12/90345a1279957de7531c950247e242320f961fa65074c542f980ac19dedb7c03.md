The axe of censorship strikes again, this time against a gay-positive
teen site.  Moral alarmists screeched that depictions of kids
embracing each other and kissing were "sexually suggestive."
 
Can't have that, can we?
 
The Seattle Times crows over the site's disappearance and praises
efforts to prevent sex education from crossing over into "sex
promotion."
 
Woo Hoo!
 
 
   Alternative Kids
 
   Welcome to the Alternative Kids Web Page! This page is
   filled with links and information for kids who are
   searching out their sexual orientation. Do you feel
   that you might be bisexual, gay, or lesbian? This is
   the place for you.

Sounds like a mirroring opportunity. :)
