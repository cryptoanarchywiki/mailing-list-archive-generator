On Sun, 14 Dec 1997 at 11:29:25 -0600 (CST) Jim Choate once again 
showed his clueless side (yes, he does have another side) wrote:

It's a real pity Choate never tried reading before spewing.
It would appear poor Jim doesn't have a clear idea of
Hayek, and has difficulty distinguishing between any of the
several voices used, and in filling in thin context. This
is another case like Jim's confusion over which "Gates" Tim
was referring to in a recent post.

Well, ego anyway.

Sounds like you should do some reading before you mouth off.

Perhaps you should have stuck with programming and kept away
from political commentary. Scratch that -- programming
requires a high degree of ability to deal with reality as
it is, not as one mistakenly sees it.

Your assignment is to read The Road to Serfdom and submit a
5,000 word essay to the c-p list on the subject of Hayek,
the brain-dead drone. Following that you will be allowed to
submit a 20,000 word essay on Jim Choate, the often-clueless
and illiterate half-wit motor mouth.
