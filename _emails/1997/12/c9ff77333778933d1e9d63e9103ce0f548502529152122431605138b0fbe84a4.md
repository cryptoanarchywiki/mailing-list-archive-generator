Hashcash in this context suffers from the 'fax effect' - the
catch 22 of "We won't install what isn't widely used".

I have not (yet) persuaded demon to allow user-defined procmail rules
on the ISP end of the phone lines.  Anybody know an ISP who does this ?
I'll be with them in days if they match the other services I want.
I can't imagine ISPs installing something at all exotic if they refuse
to use procmail.

No loss.

The above paragraph looks like a strange (and IMHO wrong) way to
mix firewall technologies.  If you are passing mail through a proxy
you won't want to either IP masq or lookup DNS records internally.

This means a huge database of who has replied to whom.  Must the
reply have headers indicating In-Reply-To a recognisable message ?
