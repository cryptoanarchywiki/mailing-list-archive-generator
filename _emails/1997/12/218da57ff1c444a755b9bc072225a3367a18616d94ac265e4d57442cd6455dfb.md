[CANADIAN NUTLY NEWS-Bienfait, Saskatchewan]CINDY COHN, LEAD COUNSEL
for the Bernstein free-speech encryption case, and part-time barmaid
at the Coaldust Saloon, denied that her successful efforts to have 
Court TV release only footage that shows her "good side" conflicts
with her client's interests.
Swatting at the drunken hand of Louis Freeh as he made repeated attempts
to grab her ass, hollering, "THIS is your GOOD SIDE, baby!", Cohn noted
that the government was making claims that the solution to the DOD's
admission of having made the physical and financial security of the 
nation and its citizens vulnerable to teenage hackers is to suppress 
the rights of the citizens to engage in free-speech.
"If the government can engage in this type of deliberate masking of 
reality, then I should be able to hide my mole...dimple...", Cohn
corrected herself.

Scott McIntosh, appellate counsel for the Justice Department, who was
drunkenly groping Freeh's ass while his attention was diverted, was
trying to explain to local reportwhores that the basis of the U.S.
government's case was not "prior restraint," but was, rather, "a 
preventative 'First Strike' against the danger of free speech in the 
hands of an unmonitored public."
Louis Freeh, once again missing Cohn's tail end, but catching the tail
end of McIntosh's statement, slapped him upside his head and screamed,
"You're not supposed to tell them that, you fucking moron!"

"John Gilmore, facing heated questions regarding his alleged anonymous
death threat against the Ninth District Court judges, told reportwhores,
"I'm not TruthMonger! I'm...Dimitri Vulis...yeah...and I'm dating
Morgan Fairchild."
