What has this to do with a couple of rednecks stopping an alleged criminal
out of the goodness of their hearts? Further, what exactly are you talking
about in reference to Gates? Yes, he is rich but what specificaly are you
referning to in regards to his mentality and lynch-mob democracies?

All government or social systems resort to lynch-mod mentatility without
some sort of bill of rights or other explicit restrainer on the system. Even
free-market-crypto-anarchy will devolve to this. Why do supports of
free-market-crypto-anarchy ignore issues regarding excesses of their beloved
systems and what kinds of checks-and-balances need to be implimented to
resolve those issues? Are you really going to claim that under
free-market-crypto-anarchy we have finaly found angels in the forms of men?
Is your claim that had there been a free-market-cryto-anarchy these people
would not have committed the crime in the first place and hence the police
and the rednecks could have stayed home? Is free-market-crypto-anarchy the
final solution in human conflict resolution?

This is a tenet of democracy as well. However, am I to interpret your
statement to mean that no, these rednecks were out of line? If so, my
question still stands. With no centralized authority of any sort and by
extension no centralized police force whose job is it to stop criminals?
Under a free-market-crypto-anarchy exactly how does the peace-keeping
process work?

If there were no police force I am sure Gates with all his money would be
on the top of a lot of hit lists - just too juicy a target to pass up. The
police we have now are deputized citizens. *That* happens to be one of the
safety checks.

What is your point?
