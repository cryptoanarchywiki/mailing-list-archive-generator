Actualy that was so far out in left field that I didn't make the connection.

Really couldn't care less about Friedman and his WWII views of the Civil
War, not relevant to what I am doing. And further, if Friedman is claiming
that this code wheel wasn't invented by the telegraphers, for the
telegraphers then perhaps he isn't as historicaly accurate as some claim of
him. It is clear that Myer invented the code wheel, per his and McClellans
own documents, expressely for telegraphy as a direct results of the success
of Myers new flag signaling system previous to the Peninsula campaign.

Perhaps there is some confusion over exactly *which part* of the Union Army
was using what. McClellan was using Myer and his techno-marvels at the
tactical level and this had no relation to the strategic communications -
the big boys might very well have been using some fancy transposition
cipher.

After Antietam McClellan told Myer:

"When I start from this camp, I want to break loose from the regular
telegraph lines and depend upon those under my command."

The 'regular telegraph' was Military Telegraph which was the strategic
minded folks. That McClellan had no stomach for them is clear.
