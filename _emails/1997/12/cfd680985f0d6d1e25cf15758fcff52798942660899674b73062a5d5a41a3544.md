Jim,

I suggest you get your facts straight.

LOC is for the Congress. Have you tried getting in and doing your own private
research? It's not piece of cake.

Every state has a public library NOW, just like every state has a welfare
office.  However I have plenty of evidence that libraries in New York were
much better when there were many private ones who charged patrons for use
- which was the case about 100 years ago.
