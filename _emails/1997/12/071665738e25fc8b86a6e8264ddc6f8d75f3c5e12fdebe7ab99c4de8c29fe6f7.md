Recently The Jewish Defense League succeded in shutting the domain ABBC.COM
hosting a database of publicly available information of Jews who endorse 
censorship.
The ISP CLEVER.NET forced Ahmed Ramito take off the list without any 
justifiable reason such as invasion of privacy.
Under U. S. law public figures must demonstrate actual malice to recover 
damages
for invasion of privacy and for defamation.
But the information is publicly available and not covered by privacy laws 
in the United States.
If you want to review what the extremist Jewish organization JDL doesn't want
you to know go to http://www.dejanews.com
Use the following search profile:
  ~a nobody@replay.com & Ahmed Rami 
Download it now and distribute it widely.
Remember to download all the article segments!
Be aware that The Jewish Defense League was founded by terrorist Meir 
Kahane whose Kach Movement
was labeled a terrorist organization by the U. S. State Department.
