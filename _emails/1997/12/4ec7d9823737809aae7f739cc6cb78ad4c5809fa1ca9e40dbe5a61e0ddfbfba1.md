If some victim of forged hatemail to Usenet requests that your remailer 
block all email containing her name and address, is that legitimate?  
Or if somebody's forging death threats with her name at the bottom?
I think yes, assuming the forgee is not a sufficiently public figure like 
Hillary Clinton or Janet Reno that would lead to obvious disbelief.

(If Gary Burnore makes the same request, you've got a tradeoff between doing
the safe thing, and blocking, or doing what he deserves and also reposting
copies run through some jive filter. :-)

I agree that blocking postings based on content that isn't specifically
targeting someone who's requested in advance is probably not a good idea.
				Thanks!
