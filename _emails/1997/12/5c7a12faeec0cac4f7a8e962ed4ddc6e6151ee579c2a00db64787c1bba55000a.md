Well, the documents that the original poster requested -- survival, MOUT
(military ops on urbanized terrain), and much more -- are not restricted.
Some make great reading and are, to my big surprise, very well written.

The manual that I recommend to cypherpunks is FM 21-20, Physical
Fitness.

According to my spot check, most of the restricted manuals are not
actually of interest to most readers. They probably want to keep the
Russian spies out of knowing some gory technical details. The stuff
that is more exciting, like FM 5-250, Explosives and Demolitions, can
be found elsewhere.

They may be sold on CD-ROMs. Look at misc.survivalism for more details,
they sell them for $24 but I am not sure what's on them.
