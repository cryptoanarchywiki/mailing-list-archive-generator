	<sigh> My apologies to Jonathan, the boyos in the Hills, and those
watching for the Choppers.  I wrote:

nation, |>etc. ?

	The vendor, Sensar, Inc. <http://www.sensar.com> is planning to
unveil the system at the Banking Administration Institute's conference in
New Orleans the day after tomorrow.   The company's version of the product
and its expected use is a little less conspiratorial than Jonathan's post
to C'punks -- but it more than suffices to force me to eat crow for my
scepticism and unwarranted sarcasm.

	Jonathan Wienke <JonWienk@ix.netcom.com> warned us all:

>I just heard that a bank card company has just released a program for using
>photos of the iris in people's eyes as a biometric ID to replace people's
>PIN codes for ATM / credit cards.  What I found really interesting is how
>they plan to implement it.  As people use the ATM, they are photographed.
>(Every ATM has a security camera.)  Over time, as people use the ATM, the
>security camera images are composited to produce a high-quality image of
>their irises, which is coded and placed in their account information.  Once
>this is accomplished, when a card is inserted into the ATM and the security
>camera gets an iris image that matches the account sufficiently closely,
>the user can conduct transactions without entering the PIN code.  People

>circumstances, entering the PIN is no longer necessary, but this is not a
>security problem.
>
>This scenario may not be a security problem, but it certainly poses a

>
>Of course, there are a few ways to beat this, such as mirror sunglasses,
>(which would only be useful while alternative credentials to eyeprint ID
