Recently a pirate radio was charged by the FCC for operating without a
license. The judge in the case heard the arguments and said their was merit
in the question of constitutionality of the FCC regulations. The radio was
allowed to stay on the air while both sides prepared their cases. Apparently
the judge said something about this being the first time such constitutional
questions had been raised.

There is also at least one piece of cpunks traffic in this about 2 weeks
old when the judge made the ruling.

I believe there might be something at one of the ARRL sites.
