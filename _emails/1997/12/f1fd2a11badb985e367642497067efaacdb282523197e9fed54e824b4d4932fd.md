I used to require that people reply to a confirmation message before I
would block them, but it was really too much effort. I check the headers,
and as long as it looks like the request came from them, I block them and
send them a message that they are blocked, so at least if it's a spoofed
request, they will know they have been spoofed.

I do exactly that, or require a request from the internic-listed contact.

Agreed, and I think I've worked out a reasonable compromise, because even
if you do try to forge somebody, it should scream, "Hey, you should be
suspicious about where this really came from."
