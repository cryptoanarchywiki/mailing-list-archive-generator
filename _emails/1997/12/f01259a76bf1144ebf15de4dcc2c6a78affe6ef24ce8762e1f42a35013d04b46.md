 ... hmmmm ... for my .02 ... isn't the entrie arguemnt rather
academic/ Thje simple matter is regradless of whose  name it is in,
its tied to a physical location where sooner or later you can be
apprehended/discovered. 

 A more reasonable question might be has anyone secured cellular
service without some serious credit/identity queries? If one can work
out he details of getting payment to them (they seem to care little
about what goes on so long as they are paid!) that preserves
anonymity, as well as keeping on the move to defy the cell trackers
then maybe there is some anonymity to be achieved.
