Your suggestions were very helpful.  Thank you for making them!

I'm calling the latest version "Cantsin Protocol No.2" and its
identifying number is "25BA1A9F5B9010DD8C752EDE887E9AF3".

It is similar to Cantsin Protocol No. 1, but the bug with the hash of
the public key is fixed.  Instead of concatenating the values p, g,
and y, you concatenate "p:<p> g:<g> y:<y>" and compute the hash.  p,
g, and y should be represented as ASCII hexadecimal digits without
leading 0s.

The hashes should now be correct SHA1 hashes.

My thinking on this is that passes are cheap these days.  I want the
signature to be unobtrusive which probably can't be done if only one
pass is required.

Incidentally, a nice feature of these signatures is that they can be
moved around in the file just by changing the offset.  You don't need
to control the secret key to do it.

The signature checker should ignore bad or incomplete signatures.  I
would consider this to be a bug in the software and not a bug in the
protocol.  A bad signature simply lacks meaning and an error message
need not be reported.

That might seem a little callous, but actually it's how we should
regard signatures.  The current model seems to be "computer, check the
signature on this file and tell me if it's good", whereas the correct
(in my view) model is, "computer, extract all of the material from
this file which is properly signed and throw out the rest."

(Of course, you could imagine a smart editor which highlighted the
areas of a document which were signed by various parties.  It seems a
little early to implement this.)

If it's not authenticated, you shouldn't even look at it.  I've taken
to putting the To: and Subject: header lines at the bottom of my
messages for this purpose.  There's really no need to keep any of the
header fields.

The header fields can be put at the end just as unambiguously as at
the beginning, but at the end they can be signed.

Strictly speaking it's there to save space.  If we put the public key
components in every signature it wouldn't be much harder for the key
management software to compute a hash on them somehow.  This does not
have to be standardized.

ACK!  I knew about this problem, but I couldn't remember exactly how
it worked.  So I said, "Monty, let's not be dumb like those PGP guys.
Let's concatenate the keys together and compute the hash.  Nobody will
ever..."

Thank you very much for pointing this out.

People who want this feature should type something like "BEGIN CANTSIN
PROTOCOL NO. 2" and "END CANTSIN PROTOCOL NO. 2" into the text at the
right points.

My feeling on this is that this is outside the scope of a signature
protocol.  The protocol should not make any assumptions about what is
being signed nor should it modify what is being signed.

I use LF to terminate lines and would recommend this to others, but it
is not part of the Cantsin Protocol No. 2 specification.

In any event, if we must put in patches to handle the poor fidelity of
electronic mail, the patches should go in afterwards.  When a
signature checking program finds ">From" it should replace it with
"From" and see if it can get the right checksum.  Likewise, it should
try the various line endings until it gets a match.  There can't be
more than about 12 variants, so this shouldn't create an onerous
burden on the machine.  (And, I suppose, it would be possible to add a
field after the length or after the hash which made a suggestion about
the line ending.)

Another great suggestion.  The hashes should be correct now.

Incidentally, in another thread I've been talking about partial
signatures.  The code above is an example of where this would be
useful.  In some countries we are not allowed to express ourselves
freely without persecution.  If I wanted to provably quote somebody
who included forbidden ideas in their message, it wouldn't be possible
without partial signatures.

This might be a good thing to add to a later Cantsin Protocol.

Schneier doesn't mention this, although presumably this information
will show up in one of his references.  Do you know offhand of a
published source which covers this?

This is just intuition, isn't it?  Since we really don't know how hard
it is to factor it seems hard to claim we know the ratio of difficulty
between breaking SHA1 and El Gamal.  Factoring could be broken before
SHA1.

Not that any great science was applied to the choice of a 2048 bit
prime, it just seemed like a good size.  ;-)

Also, I think it is a mistake for people to communicate the strength
of a system by choosing various key lengths based on general popular
views.  It's probably better to say "I estimate this system requires
at least 2^x operations to break."

We've seen this with people choosing short keys so nobody will get the
idea that it is secure.  This just seems all wrong to me.  The key
length is only one way in which a key could be insecure.  Monty
Cantsin's authentication key, for example, is not kept very securely.
But, the way to communicate that is to say "this key is not kept all
that securely."

However, in Cantsin Protocol No. 2 the size of the prime chosen is
completely unspecified.  There doesn't seem to be a reason to restrict
the choice other people will make regarding the length of the prime.

I could imagine choosing a short key for control over a
semi-persistent identity.  The advantage is that you can claim
somebody else brute forced the key for statements you wish to
repudiate.  Similarly, I could imagine choosing an obnoxiously long
key to make it hard for people who don't have super fast machines to
associate with you.
