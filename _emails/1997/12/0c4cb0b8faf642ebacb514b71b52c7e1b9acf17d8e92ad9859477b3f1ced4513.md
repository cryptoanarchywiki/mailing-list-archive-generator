Dear Applicant,

This letter tells you HOW YOU CAN GET AN INTEREST FREE CASH GRANT.
Take a few minutes to read it. You'll be suprised  to see how easy it can be to get a grant.  From time to time, everyone needs to borrow.  The problem is that for most people, getting a loan is a big hassle. Going to banks or finance companies in person takes a lot of time.  In most cases, there is endless paperwork.  And Unfortunately, in many cases all that you end up with is a rejection notice.


ABSOLUTELY NO HASSLES
________________________

Getting a Grant is probably a lot easier than you think.  In your area, 
there are usually only a small number of places that will provide you with the money, that you need.  On the other hand, there are literally thousands of grant providers who donate money to people who have genuine reasons for needing the money. 

Chances are that most banks in your area have very stringent loan
requirements.  Unlike Banks, most Grant Providers  are more lenient; 
in a sense that  persons who have poor credit, no credit, or even those who have gone through bankruptcy  are able to get the money
that they need - sent to them by a check payable to them. 
This is because foundations are NOT interested in CREDIT RATINGS.

We are not associated with any of the foundations in our program,
therefore all money will go directly to you, payable to you.  
As a Financial Finder & Matching Service, we know where the money is and which Grant Providers may be most likely to approve your grant. Our state-of-the-art search engines enables us to select multiple criteria from our database and create within minutes a list of grant providers that match your area of interest. There are thousands of grant providers with money to donate.  It is our job to put you in touch with them.

PLEASE REMEMBER: CASH-GRANTS are FREE of any interest, 
& they DO NOT NEED TO BE PAID BACK!
________________________________________________

Grant Providers give out money for a wide variety of needs as long as it is something LEGAL and within the Grant Providers' field of interest. This means that you obtain the money to cover bills, meet emergency needs, or to buy anything that you might need, as long as the Grant Provider agrees to it.


YOU DECIDE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU WANT TO OBTAIN.  
________________________________________________

The amount can be as little as $100.00, and up to $1,000,000.00 is
possible.  And remember, there is NO CREDIT CHECK.

As a Financial Finder & Matching Service, we'll review your service
application form and determine which foundations may be most likely to provide you with the money that you need.  Keep in mind that we have only reputable Grant Providers in our program.  You are protected by the fact that these foundations are regulated by the laws of the United States.

No matter how much you need to obtain, no matter what you need to use the money for; we feel confident that we can assist you to get it with the service we are offering. We will ONLY process order which we feel are within the parameters provided by the Grant Providers. 

All that you will have to do is complete the service application form below, and mail it with payment as indicated on the form.  We will process your service application within 10 days. We will match your FINANCIAL NEEDS & REQUIREMENTS with the most suitable Grant Providers in our program.
