Beta 2 is now out.

Please uninstall your old copy, using "Add/Remove programs" in the
control panel, before installing the new copy, as overinstall does not
work.

(If you forgetfully overinstall, a warning comes up, but most people
cheerfully disregard the warning)

SHA:  I failed to document that, will add it to the documentation.

Multiple recipient form works, but the user interface to use it does 
not yet exist which makes it kind of useless.  Coming soon.

Yes:  However the name is only hashed in a cryptographically weak
manner, so a third party could change the name in a cleartext message.
However if the message is cleartext there is nothing to stop him from
copying the body and giving it any signature he pleases, so this does
not actually gain the attacker anything.  After all, that is what
cleartext is.

If he changes the name it looks to the user and Kong like a new and
different signature.

Yes:  For example this message contains a nested message.

Not worried about, which is probably a seriously bad idea.  Will fix
in a later release.  In a later release I will canonicalise carriage
returns to Microsoft conventions, but not whitespace.  As this is
alas, a Borg only product, and will remain so for some time, such
canonicalisation will not break existing signed documents.

Signing binary files is not yet supported, and will not be for some
time.

Yes

Yes

If Kong says a signature is good, and the public key agrees with a
business card then the guy who wrote the business card is claiming to
be the author of the message.  Actually you do not have to check all
43 characters.  It is sufficient to check the first ten characters, or
any ten characters.

If two keys have the same passphrase, but a different secret file,
then they will be two completely different keys.

However, the same passphrase, and the same file, means the same key. 
The secret file is merely concatenated with the secret file

Minor flexibility.  You can add or remove leading blanks, and use
either lf or cr or both.  It is not totally rigid, but it is pretty
rigid.
