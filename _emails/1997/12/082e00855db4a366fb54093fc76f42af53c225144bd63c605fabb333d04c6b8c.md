You are not being coerced into anything.  If you don't want to serve
food to Blacks, don't open a restaurant.  It's your choice.

By the way, you are also not allowed to dump toxic waste in your own
backyard.  Are you being oppressed?

In a fantasy world, it is mutually consensual.  It the real world, it is 
seldom mutual.

Nope.  Of course, this has nothing to do with anything.
