You're right. My number was high. On actual count, heavy days 
ran to 40-70 while light days varied all over the lower 
landscape. Pardon me all to hell for being EIGHTEEN BILLION 
ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE OFF, putz. Is 70 "anything like 100?" Or 
is it that _you_ have been missing the majority of list 
traffic and think c-p is a low-volume list, hmmm? Wouldn't 
that be choice?

I suppose the other mail in my twice-daily 50-or-so 
message downloads _could_ have been the replies from 
heads of state and other annoyance mail I get. With 
so many filters for spam and high list noise it's 
difficult to keep track, but I'm accustomed to seeing 
more than 10 messages a day from this list. Seeing the 
c-p traffic drop to 10-15 messages per day for a few 
days caused me to suspect something might have been 
wrong.

Nothing ever goes wrong, though, does it? Silly me!

You're _so_ helpful! Courteous, too! I'll bet you have a 
lot of really good, close friends -- you know, the kind 
who wouldn't tell you if your hair is on fire.

Yeah, yeah. Your punishment in the afterlife will be to discover
that this whole universe was really just a simulation to provide 
window dressing around the amusing Jim Choate personality module 
and to endure an eternity of junior high school students playing 
your own most embarrassing moments back into your trapped 
consciousness and watching the Squirm-o-Meter peg. Those private
bathroom moments will no doubt win a lot of laughs. _I_ can be
nasty when it's called for, but you're just plain ol' bitter.

Yours have apparently accomplished a chemical humorectomy. 
That whooshing sound you hear is the humor flying like a 
U-2 over your head. Twisted humor, to be sure, but humor.
In any case the house rule doesn't benefit you. Your severe 
swings preclude further ad hoc medication.

Get a grip! I'll bet you thought MIB was a pseudo documentary
produced by the UFO crowd, huh?

Go back to your machines. They're humorless, too, except when
one lets the blue smoke leak out just to piss you off. You
know about the blue smoke, don't you? It's the essential 
ingredient that they seal into all electronic gadgets at 
the factory. If it ever leaks out, the gadget stops working.
