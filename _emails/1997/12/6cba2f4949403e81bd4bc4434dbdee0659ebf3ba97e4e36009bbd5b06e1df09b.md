I would like to point out that much of the so called "hate" speech
should in fact be labeled "hated" speech. Let's take an example:
consider a history work thet denies holocaust of Jews in WWII.

Many of such manuscripts are rather dry and historical, and certainly
do not advocate killing anybody, and do not advocate any kind of "hate"
(although their authors probably do hate Jews on a personal level).
So why are they called "hate" speech? 

Because a lot of readers hate this kind of speech. Thus, it should
be renamed into "hated" speech.
