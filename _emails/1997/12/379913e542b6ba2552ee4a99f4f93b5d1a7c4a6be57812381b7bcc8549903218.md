Since the introduction of PGP in 1991 there have been changes in the way
people use computers.  Instead of typing clumsy command lines like "pgp
-s -a -e -t -f" to perform operations, computer users today use a "mouse",
a small device about the size of a pack of cards which is connected to
the computer by a long "tail" (hence the name).

By moving the mouse they are able to move an indicator on the screen
called a "cursor".  They point the cursor at "icons", small pictures
which represent the operations they want to perform.  Clicking buttons
on the mouse allows them to manipulate data in a much more intuitive way.

Old command line programs were accessible only to a small fraction of
potential computer users.  The new mouse based graphical computers open
the world of computing to a much wider base of users.  PGP plugins
allows mail to be encrypted or decrypted with a single click of a mouse
button.  This is a far cry from the clumsy command lines of the past.

Tune in next week to find out how your trusty floppy disks may soon be
replaced by Compact Disk Read Only Memory devices.
