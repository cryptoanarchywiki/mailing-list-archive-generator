Well, no. As the person who apparently triggered this latest round of
SAFE-cracking, I'll comment on why I focussed on CDT:

* it was CDT who was issuing most of the alerts, the letters, and the
cheerleadings. (If EFF had any such messages, I didn't see them, nor did I
see such alerts from the other organizations you mentioned as being
supporters of SAFE.)

* the CDT press release was a convenient message to respond to.

* the CDT Web site is where I've been finding the text of these bills
(thanks, of course, and I mean that).

I don't worry about nonense about whether CDT pulls the strings, though in
one of my later messages I _did_ say I think CDT will carry the baggage of
SAFE the way EFF carried the baggage of Digital Telephony. People don't
forget who's out in front.
