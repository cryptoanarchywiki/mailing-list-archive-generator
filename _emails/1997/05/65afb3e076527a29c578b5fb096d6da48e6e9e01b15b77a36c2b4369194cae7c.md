  And, in spite of this, you're going to suggest more of the

  A lot of people give away their televisions to burglars, and their
wallets to armed robbers.
  The person with the largest weapon has the most authority.

  So you're about to suggest following Tim McVeigh's example, only
at the White House, instead, right?

  Right. It began life at the point of a gun, and that's the way it
should end when the monster begans feeding on those who created it.

  Sounds like a good, old-fashioned cypherpunks pissing contest
to me. Better lay in extra beer.

  This is wonderful! At last the cypherpunks have a leader who can 
speak for all of us.
  When does the New List Moderation begin? I'm going to have to lay
in a whole shitload of beer for this round.
