  Crock of shit, Ross.
  It costs me money to download unwanted spam. What's this "free"
bullshit?

  And if a woman wears short skirts, what kind of open invitation
is that? Are banks who advertise that they handle money announcing
an open invitation to the greedy?

  Spammers neither know nor care if they are causing harm to the
finances or mental well-being of others.
  If a spammer declares their right to cause me financial loss and
denial of service for the time it takes me to rid myself of their
unwanted intrusion then they can have no expectation that I, in 
turn, will not declare what level of financial loss and denial of
service I will cause them.

  So spammers have no right to lash out at my sending them a
gigabyte of email regarding the evils of spamming.

  Ross has failed to explain just how the Constitution promotes the
spammer's right to intrude upon the spammer's life and cause them
financial loss while denying that right to the spammee.
  Ross' personal feelings seem to be important enough to him to cast
slurs on those who disagree with his black-and-white opinions regarding
his right to spam others without them having a corresponding right
to reply in kind.
