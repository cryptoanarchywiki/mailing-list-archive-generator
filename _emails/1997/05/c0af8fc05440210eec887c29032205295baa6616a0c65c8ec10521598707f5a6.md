Does this agreement have a GAK clause???

Even if it does not, with the new structure of PGP they are not going to 
be releasing source code for future products so it is likely they are 
hoping the average paeon who won`t reverse engineer the executable won`t 
realise they have zeroed 72 bits of the key <g>, or are using a reduced 
round variant of some strong cipher, to give the impression of strength.
