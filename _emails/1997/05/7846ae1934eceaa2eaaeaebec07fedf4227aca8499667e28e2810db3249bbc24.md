INTERNET CAUCUS FIELD HEARING @ LIBRARY OF CONGRESS: TUE MAY 13,
    3-5PM EASTERN

One of the most crucial benefits of the Internet is it's ability to
allow government agencies to publish information to the public at a
very low cost.  Numerous examples of how the Internet has
revolutionized access to the democratic process and government exist
today, including:

* The Library of Congress' THOMAS service (http://thomas.loc.gov/) which
  makes available bills and speeches from the Congressional Record,

* The Federal Communications Commission's Daily Digest and Website  
  (http://www.fcc.gov/) which allows citizens to track every issue
  moving through the agency's processes, and

* The National Aeronautics and Space Association's Website (http://www.nasa.gov)
  which has made available photos and other astronomical images available to the
  very taxpayers that funded them.

These projects and others like them have fundamentally changed the way
Americans today keep tabs on their government.  But there's still a
long way to go, and this Internet Caucus field hearing will examine
nine examples of how the Internet is being utilized to make the
government more accessible to Americans.

You can attend this event live by listening to the live audio feed,
submit questions to the Senators and Representatives from the Internet
Caucus for the witnesses who will be there, view live photos from the
hearing room, and discuss the issue with Internet users and
Congressional staffers in interactive chat.
