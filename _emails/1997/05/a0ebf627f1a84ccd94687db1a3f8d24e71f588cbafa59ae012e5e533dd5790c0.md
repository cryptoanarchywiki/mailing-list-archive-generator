..........................................................................


The first sentence implies that Nurilogical proposes that government should
be held accountable by its citizens, including himself ("*when* will we").

On the other hand, he obviously believes in the authority of the US
government, as he has always supported it in arguments on the list,
especially in counter arguments against TCM.

So, it appears that VZN is not *ready* to hold the government accountable,
preferring not to protest when his own money is withheld for him, but
hypocritically wondering when everyone will make this will happen.

However, he's correct:   similar to the argument I made about there being
no difference between those who kill the good along with the bad & the ugly
(that's from the title of a Clint Eastwood movie, for those who aren't
familiar with that line),  all those who argue for morality and libertarian
ideals, but still "give in" when it comes to tax time, are all losers. <g>    

But this shameless capitulation is intellectualized away with the
explanation that everyone is outnumbered by the men holding the legalized
guns, who are in turn supported by all those true believers in The American
Socialist Way of Life;  that way being: the reception of benefits without
any need to be consciously aware of, to identify, their actual source or
the actual method of their obtainment.
