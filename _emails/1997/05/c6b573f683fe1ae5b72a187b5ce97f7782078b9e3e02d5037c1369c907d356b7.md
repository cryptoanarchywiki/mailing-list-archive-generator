The SysAdmin for the domain has installed AccessWatch for maintaining an 
HTML version of hit statistics for the server. This application is doing 
what you mention above. There is no nefarious purpose in trying to get 
you to my page. Check out: http://www.dis.org/access to see what all the 
cookies being sent are being used for.
