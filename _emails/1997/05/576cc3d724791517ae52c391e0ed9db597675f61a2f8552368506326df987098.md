There's a place near Palm Springs, California where palm trees sway, 
sparkling hot mineral pools dance in the sunlight and your worries melt
away with the special touch of our world class staff. Spacious rooms, 
soothing massages, facials, and body therapies await you. 

We have two mineral water wells that continuously pump hot water into
8 pools, (one is Olympic size).

To immediately receive a discount and get a FREE cool T-shirt mailed 
to you, call the Desert Hot Springs Spa Hotel at 1-800-808-7727 and
