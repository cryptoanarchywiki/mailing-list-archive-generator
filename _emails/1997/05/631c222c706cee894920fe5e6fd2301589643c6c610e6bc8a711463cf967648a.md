Subject: Remailers for Dummies?

I'm interested in setting up a remailer (I already have, to a small
degree), but I'm looking for a remailers-howto, something that
covers the issues beyond `mere' compiling. Things like, getting
a Mixmaster and a Type1 remailer to cooperate nicely; how to
minimize complaints and legal hassles. If there's a remailer-
operators list, I'd love to know about that too.

Please address replies to dave@columnist.com - as much as anything,
I'm sending this message through my proto-remailer (based on the
freedom code) to make sure it works :)
