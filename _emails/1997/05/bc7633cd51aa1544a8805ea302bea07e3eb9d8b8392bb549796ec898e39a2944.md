The article on Bell was printed in this morning's Oregonian.

Hoo Boy!

They are accusing him of all sorts of nasty shit!

"Planning to poison the Bull Run watershed with Botulism."

"Planning to use a carbon thread attack on the 911 system."

And more.

If John Young has not printed the article by the time I get home from
work, I will type the whole thing in.

They are REALLY playing rough this time!
