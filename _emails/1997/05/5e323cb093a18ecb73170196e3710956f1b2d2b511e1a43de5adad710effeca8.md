I seem to recall a proposal from the late 19th century suggesting that
the Patent Office be closed because there was nothing left to invent.
In a similar, but more serious vein, I think Congress should be shut
down, because there are no new laws that we need.

Excepting, of course, my earlier anonymous suggestion that children be
kept from "soft targets".

I'm not a TruthMonger, but I play one on T.V.
