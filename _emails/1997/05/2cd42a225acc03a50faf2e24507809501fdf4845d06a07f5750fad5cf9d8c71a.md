ROTFL! To quote the infamous snow:
"Pot. Kettle. Black."

A better question would be: How many people did you and your bots and 
your cohorts spam in this century alone?  [Including Moslems, and Jews]
And how many flame wars have you ignited?  

(And I promise that I won't tell anyone that you ate ham and cheese
sandwitches with your white bread on passover unless I do so in public.) 
:)

Now that I think about it... I suppose since Earthweb sells Java, and java
contains caffeine (virtual mind you) and caffeine is addictive, you could say
Earthweb is a virtual "drug" dealer, but corrupt and criminal?  Ha!  

Oh, before I forget, remind me to send you a pack of Oren's Earthweb Blend
coffee (which we give out at trade shows) one of these days.  The first pack
is free, once you're addicted... errrr... if you like it you can order 
more from Oren's Daily Roast.  <evil grin>
