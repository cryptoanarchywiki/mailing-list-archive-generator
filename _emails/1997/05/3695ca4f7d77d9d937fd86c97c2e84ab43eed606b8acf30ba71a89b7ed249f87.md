Ladies and Gentlemen,

As the time goes on and I see what is happening inside and outside our
list, I am getting increasingly concerned about the small number of hosts
in the cypherpunks network.

Practically, most of the people use only two nodes, Kent's and mine, and
thanks to Jim, we have three operating ones. I do not believe that it is
good enough.

If anyone has any creative idea of how to get a couple more reliable
nodes, please share it.

igor
