  Yet another dweeb who considers the list not to be worthwhile,
but who wants to tell everyone else what to read and what not to
read, nonetheless.
  Is there going to be another round of missives about how the list's
ASCII art is the Big Enemy of cypherpunks everywhere? I'm have much
more concern about a small pimple I just found on my butt. Perhaps
I should start a thread to discuss the implications of this for
privacy and freedom worldwide.
