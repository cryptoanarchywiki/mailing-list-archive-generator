As I recall, 3des ( DESk1 -> DESk2^-1 -> DESk3 ) has an effective
keylength of 112 bits.  Less than IDEA.  Schneier discusses this.

I dislike this line of argument for several reasons.  It reduces security
to the lowest common denominator.  Because, the argument goes, few people 
will use more than a 21 character passphrase, then we need not design
anything with more security.

In reality, I think that the percentage of people who use more than an 8
character passphrase, especially outside these circles, is small.
Following your logic, our high end of security should be about 48 bits.

Again, you have taken an important concept, total security, and reversed
it.  Instead of aiming to make each link as strong as possible, you have
aimed to design around the weakest link.

This is a serious mistake in my view.

It costs little today to develop a cipher with larger keyspace.  (DES with
independent subkeys already exists and has a basic keyspace of 768 bits.
A meet in the middle attack reduces keyspace to 2^384.  Schneier discusses
the cipher briefly).  If users are willing to deal with large keys (I
certainly am) then software designers are restraining a more secure
implementation.

I think most will agree that anything over 150 bits makes brute force
a losing effort.  Unfortunately it has to be deployed first.
