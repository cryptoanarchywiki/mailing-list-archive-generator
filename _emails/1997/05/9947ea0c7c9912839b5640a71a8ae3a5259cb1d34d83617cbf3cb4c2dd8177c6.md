I have seen only 3 or 4 posts from the cypherpunks list in the last 24 
hours now, I have unsub-scr-ibed from algebra.com (which did not repond to 
a ping at around 11am GMT today) and re-sub-scr-ibed to cyberpass.net, but 
have still only seen another one post (raphs remailer ping post). 
Has anyone else experienced problems, inside the UK or outside? 

All of the post that have come through have been sent initially to 
toad.com, my guess would be that nearly everyone, regardless of where 
they are sub-scr-ibed, is sending posts to algebra.com, which appears to be 
down, therefore cyberpass and ssz, even though they are up, have not got 
many messages to send on, does anyone know where toad.com is forwarding 
posts to?

I wonder if this outage might have anything to do with Igor moving the 
list to another machine, as I seem to remember he said he was, although 
if I recall correctly he did not think this would cause a problem. As I 
said, cyberpass is definitely up and has responded to my majordomo request.
