As part of its electronic services, the ISN has newly
established the following directories:

1) An electronic CONFERENCE AGENDA in the field of
international relations, regional security, as well as
peace and conflict studies (including both physical
and virtual conferences). Conference announcements are
accepted independently from having an own home page.

2) a special DIRECTORY OF ELECTRONIC DISCUSSION LISTS
in the same fields.

The aim of the two new services is to facilitate information
exchange about international academic events and to promote
the use of electronic means for interactive dialogue within
the security community. Both directories are accessible from
the ISN home page.

Members of the community are called upon announcing their
forthcoming activities through this new public directories.

Thank you for your cooperation.

The ISN team

*********************************************************
The ISN is maintained by the Center for Security Studies
and Conflict Research at ETH Zurich, in conjunction with
the Euro-Atlantic Foundation, Brussels, and EINIRAS.
ISN is supported by the Swiss Government.
