Hey, I _didn't_ do it. Honest. No fooling. I was more than 30 miles away
when that blast went off, and you can't place me in OKC anytime that
morning.

And my closest contacts with the Elohim City patriots were on a mailing
list Waco whiste-blower Linda Thompson was involved with.

(It's true that I gave some patriots some tips on encrypting, but that's
not a crime. And mostly I just gave them pointers to sites. Ditto for some
enemies of the Zionist Entity, but that's another story.)

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
