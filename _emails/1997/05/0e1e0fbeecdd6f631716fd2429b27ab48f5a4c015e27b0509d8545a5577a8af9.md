Actually, you must be confusing me with someone else -- I can't, to 
my recollection, remember ever having said anything about this 
before.  (Of course, you could always go back in the archives and check.) 
I was just responding to the idea mention by someone else (except 
I think they worded it "ciphers are cool" or something like that).

With a memory like mine (and yours too, apparently) reading the 
archives would do no good -- I can't remember a thousandth of all the 
stuff I read, anyway.
