First off, Roger, you need to find better _quoting_ software for your
replies, or explicity add "begin quote" and "end quote" markers, as some
folks are forced to do. And/or set your word wrap to a standard 70-78
columns. I found it hard to tell my own comments from your added comments,
and this only because I was able to recognize my own words! No doubt others
simply gave up and pressed the "D" key on your reply.

I suggest that just because you chose to characterize the sources as
"clueless Washington think tank authors" does not (as they say in Star Trek
- The Next Generation) "make it so".  The "allegation" that foreign
governments actively participate in actions to violate personal privacy
("borrowing" laptops from traveling businesspeople, taping phones, etc.)
are all documented in various places.  Of course, they could all the result
of a single psyop with excellent results.  But I doubt it.

You may surmise what you choose.  In fact, that is the essence of free
discourse.  Of course, knowing is far better than surmising.  If you care
to suggest a reading list please feel free to mail it to me direct.  And
yes, I am new to this most charming and entertaining list.  Thank you for
the welcome


(end of the quotes from Roger)

Your first point, using some kind of Star Trek lingo, is beyond comment. I
provided a lot more context than your original point provided, and yet you
seem to want even more documentation. Go back and read the archives for a
discussion of this paper (hint: search on "remailers" ANDed with "SAIC."
Pay particular attention to the critique of this paper by such folks as
Raph Levien, and others.

As for sending a reading list to you "direct," first send me a check for
$125.00 and I'll start working on it for you.
