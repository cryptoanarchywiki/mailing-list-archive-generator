  Nor does citing a litany of 'Libertarian Approved Sources of
Good and Righteousness" reduce the size of the stick getting
shoved up one's butthole, or the right and responsibility of
those who oppose this action to speak up.
  These fine, upstanding organizations that Shabbir speaks of
have all become a part of the system. They have learned to
play along with the compromise game, just like would-be
terrorists who give up their hostages one-by-one to the
'negotiators'.
  The secret of hostage negotiation is to convince your opponent
that you are his 'friend' and to convince him/her to be 'reasonable'.
(Read "compromise.")

  I recently had a lawyer who suggested that I take the 'deal'
that the prosecution was offering me, because it was a 'good
one', even though I was innocent.
  Fuck him. I acted on my own behalf and tore the prosecutor a
new asshole in court.
  The irony is that my lawyer, in the words of the judge, herself,
was "one of the better lawyers" in the community.

  Fuck the "CDT, the ACLU, EPIC, VTW, EFF, Eagle Forum, Americans 
for Tax Reform, and PGP Inc."
  And fuck Mother Teresa if she wants me to support the SAFE bill.
I don't care how many children she's saved, it has nothing to do
with my decision to fight against bad legislation.
