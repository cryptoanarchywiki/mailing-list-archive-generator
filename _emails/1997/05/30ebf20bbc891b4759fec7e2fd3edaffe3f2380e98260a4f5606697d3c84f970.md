  Neither can I. Although some on the list claim I live in an ivory
tower while they live in the real world I haven't seen these cowards
coming forward to engage in any meaningful protest of the railroading
of Jim Bell.

  While I can't speak for the effectiveness of this approach, I
would venture that any action of this sort would have a greater
chance of success with the cooperation of a government employee
such as myself who has access to the computers in the target
area. (We are not all government shills.)

  I will do likewise. I am forced to slant my regular posts to the
list to agree with government policy but unlike my detractors I
at least have the courage to take a stance against my employer's
unjust actions and challenge them to prove their case if they
wish to retaliate against me for exercising my right to free speech.
