I will shortly be releasing my new book, "The ASCII Code" which
outlines the predictions made based on decrypting the hidden
messages in the ASCII artwork sent to the cypherpunks list.

Since none of the predictions have proven accurate, my book
speculates that perhaps Tim May isn't a cocksucker, after all.

All proceeds from the book will be converted to eca$h and used
to wager on the predicted date of death for Graham-John Bullers
