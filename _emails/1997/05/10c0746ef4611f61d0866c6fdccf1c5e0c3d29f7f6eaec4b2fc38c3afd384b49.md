_2600 Magazine_ had an article about this a few years back, called "Gulf War
Printer Virus," I believe. I think in that version of the story, it wasn't a
narrow band xmitter but a virus that affected a computer connected to the
printer's parallel port, infecting itself via the sole pin ("out of paper" i
think it said) on the port that xmitted from printer to computer rather than
the normal other way around. As to whether or not this virus was of the
computer or media variety, however, remains to be seen.
