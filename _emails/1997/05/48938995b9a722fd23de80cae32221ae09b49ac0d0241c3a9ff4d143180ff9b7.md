I conceed this general point, but in context it does not stand up.
Specifically we were referring to the trade off between cipher keylength
and password size.

It was proposed that because people were unlikely to deal with passwords
large enough to fill the key with e.g., 128 bits of entropy, that it was
worthless to bother with 128 bit symetric ciphers.  I find this a hard
position to support.

Ok, where are the 256+ bit blowfish implementations?
