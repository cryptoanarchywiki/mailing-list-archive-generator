Timothy must be drunk; I can't believe he said this.   Because he wouldn't
spend so much time writing sensible things of Truth & Light, if he thought
the better thing to do for achieving libertarian values was to kill so
indiscriminately with a bomb.    After all, he subscribes to utmost
discrimination.   So I think right now he's less in the engagement of
Reason and more under the influence of maybe some Bud Light.
