Tired of Task Switching?
 
If you are tired of switching from WebSeeker to your web browser and
back, then your day of deliverance has arrived.  WebSeeker 3.x detects
whether you have Microsoft Internet Explorer installed and embeds
Internet Explorer within WebSeeker if you do.  To activate this
embedded browser, click View/Abstract.  Check out this screen shot!

If you have an earlier version of WebSeeker then upgrade now!

Netscape Users - You can use Netscape as your default browser
and still take advantage of this feature with IE.

Also new in 3.2: Highlight words in any application, hit the
FindNow! icon in your tray and WebSeeker will start your search.
