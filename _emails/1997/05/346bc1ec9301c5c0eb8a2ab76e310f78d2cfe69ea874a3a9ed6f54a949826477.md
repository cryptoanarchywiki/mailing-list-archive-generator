Hi,

I am in the process of expanding my business. While this will not effect the
stability of the Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer, in fact we hope to make it
more stable, it will mean some additional resources being available in the
near future. I unfortunately can't say more on this now.

However, I can say that 'CyberTects' will most likely cease to exist in a
matter of days. It will be subsumed in the creation of a newer and larger
business entity (we are currently fighting over the name). This new entity
will be taking on the SSZ network & its user base. I will still be directly
responsible for the operation and customer satisfaction of SSZ users.

There will be more announcements in the near future. However, if you have
specific questions (no answer promised) please feel free to send them to me.
