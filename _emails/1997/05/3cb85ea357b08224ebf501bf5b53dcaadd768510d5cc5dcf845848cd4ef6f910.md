I assume you will pass this information on.  Please don't associate my name
with it.

I have heard that Apple has a working implementation of Elliptic Curve
Cryptography.  Because of the export regulations they don't want to include
it in their products.  If anyone wants to try to change their minds, now
would be a good time.
