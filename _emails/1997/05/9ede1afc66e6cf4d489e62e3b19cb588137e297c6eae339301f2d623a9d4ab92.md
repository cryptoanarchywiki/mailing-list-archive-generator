I found it quite troubling the number of legal activities that were cited
in the complaint as if they were illegal.

- -- Possesion of "assault weapons"
- -- Possession of documents on explosives
- -- Possession of documents on poisons
- -- Possession of documents on biological agents
- -- Possession of documents regarding the adverse affects of carbon fibers
on electrical equipment.

All of the above "crimes" I am guilty of as:

Thanks to the 2nd amendment it is still legal in this country to own a
gun. If I recall right when "assault weapon" became a popular Washington
buzz word it referred to any semi-automatic weapon.

Documentation on explosives, poisons, and biological agents can be found
in numerous text books & articles on chemistry, engineering, biology, and
medical sciences. Due to my schooling and work in both the engineering &
medical fields I have an entire wall of my office covered with such books
and articles.

I don't posess any documents on carbon fibers but I would think that it is
obvious to anyone with an IQ greater than their shoe size (or that of an
IRS agent) that electronic equipment introduced to copper coated fibers
are not long for this world. :)
