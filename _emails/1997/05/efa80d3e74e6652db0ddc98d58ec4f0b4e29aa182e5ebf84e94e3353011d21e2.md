This was taken from the Alameda County District Attorney's Office
publication "The Point of View":

In a murder trial, the defense attorney was cross examining a pathologist.
Here's what happened:

ATTORNEY:  Before you signed the death certificate, had you taken the pulse?
CORONER:   No.
ATTORNEY:  Did you listen to the heart?
CORONER:   No.
ATTORNEY:  Did you check for breathing?
CORONER:   No.
ATTORNEY:  So, when you signed the death certificate, you weren't sure the
           man was dead, were you?
CORONER:   Well, let me put it this way.  The man's brain was sitting in a
           jar on my desk.  But I guess it's possible he could be out there
           practicing law somewhere.
