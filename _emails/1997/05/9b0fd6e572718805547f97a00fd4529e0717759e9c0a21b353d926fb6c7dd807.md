Not to mention the fact that this bitch will grab any email addresses
(including your own) that pass through those accounts and use them for his
own spamming purposes.  Don't do it, it's not worth it, not just for the
money going to a shit eating weasel, but for the principle of the thing -
you'd cause the spamming of everyone using it or communicating with it. 

If you get a web site with them, they'd grab all the email addresses from
the surfers' browsers.  Hell, you might as well get an account on
nsa.gov while you're at it.
