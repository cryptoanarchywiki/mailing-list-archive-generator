In reading the complaint Jim was using a copper coated carbon fiber mesh
that was then to be processed (probably cut up and ground) into a fine
pouder so it could be delivered airborn. I think that the critical
ingrediant was the copper coating and not the carbon itself though it
should have an additive affect for the reasons mentioned above.
