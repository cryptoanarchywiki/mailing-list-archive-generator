..Mailing-list spammers..

    Email spam is the favorite gripe of most Netizens, excepting the
    spammers. Congress is considering legislation [25] to limit the
    practice of sending unwanted commercial email in bulk. Not everyone
    thinks this is a good idea. See [26] for a thread from an ongoing
    debate on Declan McCullagh's fight-censorship mailing list. George
    Matyjewicz <mosaic1@ix.netcom.com> did a modest experiment on a
    week's worth of his email -- he is on 56 mailing lists and gets
    around 200 messages a day -- to gauge how widespread the problem
    actually is. Matyjewicz posted these results:

                        week     avg/day

      Total messages    1,354    193.4
      Spam messages        10      1.4     < 1 %
      Spam complaints     189     27.0      14 %

    Mailing-list owners share information on the addresses from which
    commercial spam messages originate. Recently Alexander Verbraeck
    <A.Verbraeck@duticai.twi.tudelft.nl> posted a particularly compre-
    hensive list of purported spammers. I have taken the liberty of
    preserving a snapshot on the TBTF archive [27], sorted both by email
    address and by "virulence" -- the total number of messages sent by
    each spammer over a given time period to two of Verbraeck's lists.
    Thanks to Tom Parmenter <tompar@world.std.com> for the tip.
