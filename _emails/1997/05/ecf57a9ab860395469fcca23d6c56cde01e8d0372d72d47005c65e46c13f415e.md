  The story so far:
  Mr. Nobody sends a message to the cypherpunks list via an
anonymous remailer suggesting that someone ought to fuck with
Cyberpromo. Cyberpromo gets fucked with shortly thereafter.
  Mr. Nobody sends a message to the cypherpunks list suggesting
that it's time for something unfortunate to happen to those
leading the push for new crypto limits.

  Perhaps someone should start a betting pool to guess whether
the spooks are taking aim at the remailers or if they are setting
up a particular cypherpunk, instead.
  We could start a betting pool to guess who will shortly have
something "unfortunate" happen to them, but that might get the
winner in a lot of trouble.
