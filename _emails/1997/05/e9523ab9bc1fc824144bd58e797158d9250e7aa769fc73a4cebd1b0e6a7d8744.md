Suppose you wanted a commercial ISP to run a Winsock middleman remailer on.
An ISP that was tolerant of the kinds of abuse and SPAM that remailers 
occasionally suffer from.  An ISP who'd take your money and leave you alone. 
An ISP who wouldn't drop your account because of bad publicity. 
An ISP that could be a stable anchor for a remailer system,
and maybe even for web-page remailers.

Well, such an ISP exists, but there's a catch.  It's Cyberpromo.com --
An ISP whose reputation capital was already so LOW that another 
gigabyte of flames to the postmaster wouldn't really be noticed.  
The good news is that service is pretty cheap - $50/2yrs POP+autoresponder,
or $39 one-time for a mail forwarder.  Don't know if he takes anonymous 
accounts, but probably does, since money orders are more reliable than most 
of his customers :-)  Also don't know how he'd respond to subpoenas and 
warrants (probably quickly?) or wiretap requests (he's not a telco), 
or how long before he'll be assassinated or banned or IDPd.

The bad news, of course, is that Spamford's negative reputation rubs off
on the whole remailer system, and you risk a lot more spamming and
anti-spammer attacks on your remailer (hence more administration work),
and you risk raising Spamford's public image, and it does involve
giving money to Spamford, which could be viewed as rewarding bad behaviour.
You'd probably want to limit the remailer to one email destination per 
message to cut down on spamming.
