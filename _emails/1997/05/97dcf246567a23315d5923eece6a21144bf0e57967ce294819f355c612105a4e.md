Also no surprise here in California, where gambling is a crime--unless the
State of California runs the gambling operation. E.g., the Lottery system.

(Actually, there are a few exceptions to this state monopoly on gambling.
Indian reservations have the right, though this right is being challenged
up and down the state, to run certain types of casinos. And "card clubs"
are permitted, under certain conditions.)

To paraphrase a line from my .sig, there's something wrong when the State
outlaws some behavior or practice but then sets itself up as the monopoly
supplier.

What's next? California Houses of Sexual Relief? ("Our schools win too!")

I've found that even nonlibertarians are chagrinned by this display of
governmental greed. If something is a crime, it's a crime. I don't think
gambling is a crime, but the State has decreed that is. Hard to believe
they bust casual gamblers who bet on bowling games (a recent case) while
running their own lottery.

(And the lotteries have incredibly bad payoff odds...something like 30-40%,
if I remember correctly. A slot machine with these odds would be shut down
instantaneously as being a theft device! The state lotteries are often
called "taxes on stupidity," and none of the well-off folks I know ever
play this sucker's game. So, I should be rejoicing that Ma and Pa Kettle
are squandering their paychecks on State-run gambling...but the principle
is the thing I object to.)

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
