The probability of innocent people getting in trouble with
this scheme is very high.

For example, a stray cat, a child, a curious bird or even a rat could
open the box and spread the infection.

If you do not do this stuff well enough, in a while the packaging
will break and leak. 

The most likely person to suffer will be you, anyway. I could not care
less about you, but these diseases are contagious.
