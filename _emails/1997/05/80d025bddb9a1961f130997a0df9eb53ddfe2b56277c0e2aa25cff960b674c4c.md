		WORKSHOP ON INFORMATION HIDING

		      15 - 17 April 1998

		       Portland, Oregon


Many researchers are interested in hiding information or in stopping other
people doing this. Current research themes include copyright marking of 
igital objects, covert channels in computer systems, subliminal channels 
in cryptographic protocols, low-probability-of-intercept communications,
broadcast encryption schemes, and various kinds of anonymity services 
ranging from steganography through location security to digital elections.

These closely linked areas of study were brought together in 1996 by a
workshop on information hiding held at the Isaac Newton Institute in
Cambridge. This was felt to be very worthwhile by the research community, 
and it was decided to hold a second workshop in 1998.

This second international workshop on information hiding will be held in 
Portland, Oregon from the 15th to the 17th April 1998. 


Instructions for authors:

Interested parties are invited to submit papers on research and practice
which are related to these areas of interest. Submissions can be made
