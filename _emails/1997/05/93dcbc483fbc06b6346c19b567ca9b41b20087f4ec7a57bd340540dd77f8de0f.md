Does anyone know how many people are using Jim's cypherpunks@ssz.com?
If you send `who cypherpunks' to it you get back an empty mail.  But
he has stated that he does this on purpose to protect the privacy of
his subscribers...  It would still be nice to know how _many_ are on
ssz.com as opposed to _who_ is on ssz.com, just to know approx. the
architecture of the lists for such purposes.

Also I might point out that the afforded privacy is mostly illusionary
because any TLA who cared could observe the mail fanning out from
ssz.com with Sender: cypherpunks-owner@ssz.com and reconstruct the
list in short order.
