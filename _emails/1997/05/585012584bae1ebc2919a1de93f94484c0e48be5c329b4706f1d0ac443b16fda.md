Indeed, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is very much in line with what I see
all around me (and with Nietzsche's "will to power," of course).

The fact that I have spent many hours a day for almost 5 years on this and
related mailing lists, for which I've received not a dime of financial
benefit, ought to make clear that some things are more important than
making more money.
