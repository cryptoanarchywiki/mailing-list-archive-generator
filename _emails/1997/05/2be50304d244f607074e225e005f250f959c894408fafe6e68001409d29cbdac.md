What the ultimate result here should be we all demand our legislators pass
a law prohibiting the establishment of daycare centers, schools, hospitals
or nursing homes within 1000 ft of government centers, army bases, or any
federal offices.

They could call it the "No Human Shielding law."

What legislator would dare complain that the federal government not use
his or her constituents children to shield ATF, FBI or other TLA agents?

Hey, it's "For the children", right?
