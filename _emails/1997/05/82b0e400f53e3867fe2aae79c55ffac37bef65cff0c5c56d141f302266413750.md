This is from the Oregonian May 16th, 1997 page B3 under the Vancouver
section.

2nd home raided in probe of anti-government activities

A team of federal agents, led by IRS internal security personnel, raided a
home at 711 W. 20th St. Thursday morning.

The raid apperently is a continuation of an investigation into the
activities of James D. Bell, whose McLaughlin Heights home at 7214
Corregidor Road was raided April 1st.

The 20th Street home is occupied by Robert W. West, who was not home when
the raid occured.

A federal agent who answered his phone during the search refused to say
what the agents were seeking.

The search warrent application and affidavit is under seal by a federal
court in Tacoma.

In the affidavit for the search warrent for Bell's home, IRS Special
Investigator Jeff Gordon alledged that Bell was "directly solicting others
to set up a system to murder government officials."

Bell is the author of a 10-part essay called "Assassination Politics,"
which has been widely circulated on the Internet, particularly in
anti-government forums.

After the raid, agents made no other public statements.
