There will be a "War on Porn" on the internet that will mirror the
"War on Drugs" currently taking place. 
All that the government wants is their piece of the action. Like
drugs, the porn will always be available, but the price will 
fluctuate according to the level of government control and/or
illegality.
The "War on Porn" will turn into another essential national industry
which will become part of the GNP.

The "winners" in this war will be the journalists who have covered
the "War on Drugs" as they will merely have to dust off old stories
and substitute "Porn" for "Drugs" wherever it occurs.
The "loser" will be the Hoover Vacume Cleaner Company, whose development
of Virtual Cathouse technology will fall victim to new legislation.
