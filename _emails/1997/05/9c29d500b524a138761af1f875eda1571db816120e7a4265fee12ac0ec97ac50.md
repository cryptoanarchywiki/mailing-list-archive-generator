News report today:

   Reinsch told reporters that strategy will be to follow advice
   he has been given and not to circulate Administration draft
   bill. Issue is so polarized, he said, that that bill would be
   dismissed quickly, and some of its content that lawmakers
   might want to adopt also would be rejected because it came
   from Administration. Reinsch said it's close call, and
   Administration is reevaluating its tactics constantly. 

This seems to coordinate with Kerrey's initiative to lump
all crypto bills into one "acceptable to the leadership
and the White House."

BTW, another report claims that proposed new regs will allow 
banks the special privilege of strong crypto if they come up 
with an acceptable KMI within two years.

This seems to be what Kerrey means when he says NSA's
Crowell is working with industry to develop an acceptable
KMI along the lines of what government is preparing for
its own use.

All interests to be subservient to the Number One interest?
