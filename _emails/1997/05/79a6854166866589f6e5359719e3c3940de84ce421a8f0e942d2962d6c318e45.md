Care to tell us how this tracing is done without cooperation of the remailers?

Perhaps you don't understand how remailers work, how many messages they
accumulate to provide the mixing entropy, and how long they typically delay
messages. (Latency, or the delay, is not the central issue...mixing entropy
is. But, in practice, latency is associated with this.)

I agree. But we can't help you, as you seem to be unknowledgeable about the
basic nature of digital mixes. If you won't take the time to figure out the
basics of how they work, how can we keep writing articles trying to correct
your misapprehensions?
