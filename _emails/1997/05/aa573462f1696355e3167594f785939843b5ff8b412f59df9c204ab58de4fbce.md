No helpful suggestion here but I wanted to point out that in both instances 
after I installed PGPMail 4.5 in January and PGP for Personal Privacy 5.0
last 
week, I found that the cute little radio buttons had been automagically 
installed in my copy of Eudora Pro 3.0 (they also work with the freeware Lite 
version of 3.0).  They do not appear on the frames of the general program 
"window" because encryption/decryption cannot be used there but if you open a 
message window to create a message or to read a message, there the little 
buttons are.  I am using WIN95 of course.

If the Mac is not as user friendly, I think that's too bad.  Look on the 
message window frames.  Maybe the buttons are there.

I've been frantically signing and encrypting ever since January.  I want PGP 
Inc. to release PGP Disk for WIN95 (it's out for the MAC).  I need a disk 
encryptor that can work with WIN32.

I have even been able to browbeat friends and family into installing the new 
PGP versions.  There's a lot to be said for on-click encryption (or no click 
in the case of 5.0 since you can set signing or encryption or both to be the 
default condition for Eudora.  Hit <Queue> of <Send> and PGP pops up and does 
its thing.
