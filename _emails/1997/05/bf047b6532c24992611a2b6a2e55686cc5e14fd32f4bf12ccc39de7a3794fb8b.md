Actually we are well passed that point. Jim Bell's arrest and pending 
prosecution amounts to thought crime. Its not "possible they commited 
a crime" now its possible that they "may" commit a crime.

 At Waco, dozens of innocents were killed, burned alive on national 
television in their home and church from an unwarranted, excessive 
use of force in order to serve a search warrant on David Koresh for 
what they "may" have been doing.  No one was under indictment, under 
arrest or accused of an actual crime, yet through media manipulation 
that branded koresh and his followers Kooks, the nation watched 
another act of Statist-TV-Terrorism. The message through the 
medium this time?,   "We don't need no stinking charges."

Mandatory sentencing (a legislative and executive end run that usurps 
judiaciary power by eliminating judicial discretion)

 Terroristic Speech (a euphemism for 'thought 
crime' in many cases) are two examples of end runs around citizens 
contitutionaly protected rights that are being used daily to commit 
violent attacks on individual citizens civil rights.
