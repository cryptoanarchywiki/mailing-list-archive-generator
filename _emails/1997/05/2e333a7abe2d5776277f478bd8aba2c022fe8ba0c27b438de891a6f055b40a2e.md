The May 10 Economist has a special survey of
global electronic commerce.

It's a timely piece of battlespace intelligence for Tim's 
"war underway."

It pinpoints financial soft target CyberPromos receiving 
favorable crypto treatment by the world's governments
to manage the Net.

Eric Hughes is featured in its analysis of the birth 
or death struggle of digital cash -- the key battle,
if you will, of breaking the global banks and ranks 
of centralized information.

A battle underway in the US by the TLAs, the Key 
Recovery Alliance and the ABAs of the banks and the 
lawyers aiming for supremacy -- domestic and global --
by managing ever-thinning wallets.
