ABOUT PRIVACY INTERNATIONAL

Privacy International was formed in 1990 as a watchdog on
surveillance by governments and corporations. With members in
more than 40 countries, it has created an international
movement that has helped to counter abuses of privacy by way
of information technology. Privacy International has conducted
campaigns in Europe, Asia and North America to raise awareness
about the dangers of ID card systems, military surveillance,
data matching, police information systems, and credit
reporting. It is based in London, UK, and is administered by
the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) in
Washington, D.C. Privacy International publishes a quarterly
newsletter (the International Privacy Bulletin) and organizes
conferences each year on privacy and technology. More information
is available at http://www.privacy.org/


ABOUT THE GLOBAL INTERNET LIBERTY CAMPAIGN

The Global Internet Liberty Campaign is an international
coalition of 28 human rights, free speech, cyber-liberties and
privacy groups that has come together to promote free speech
and privacy on the Internet. More information is available
