1. What spamming?  All this was hypothetical.

2. What I do from my accounts is my business and not Earthweb's.

3. The only criminal character that has spammed here is you - see all the 
"Timmy May" messages, the "news" messages of 100K+, all the spambots 
you've writen and posted here, and your flame wars.

If anyone doubts this, they need to do a net search on the word "Vulis" 
to see your lovely work.   Crawl back under your rock, you're boring us.

If you can't come up with anything entertaining like you used to, don't 
bother.  You're repeating yourself like the broken KGB mouthpiece that 
you are.  To quote Monty Python "I fart in your general direction.  Your 
mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries."

Now, either shut up, or do something worthy of your KOTM label.  Yeah, 
and that is a challenge - incase you're too stupid to figure it out.
