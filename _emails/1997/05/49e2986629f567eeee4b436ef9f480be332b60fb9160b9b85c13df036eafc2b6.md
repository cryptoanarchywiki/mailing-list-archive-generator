The main thing that puzzled me about that episode was that
everybody made such a big deal over it.  
I mean, didn't _everybody_ remember that Ollie North's Contra buddies 
were smuggling coke and occasionally getting caught at it?  
   The whole Yankee-Panamanian War was largely caused by my 
   liberal friends with their "Bush and Noriega in '88" bumper stickers 
   that George "I am not a wimp!" Bush had to distance himself from :-)  	
		"Bush and Noriega - A _Crack_ Team!"

And then there's "The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia",
for a more scholarly and thorough treatment; I think the followon book
was just named "The Politics of Heroin".
