That's only the best case (for the cryptanalyst).  Breaking 3DES with
only 2^112 encryptions requires 2^56 plaintext-ciphertext pairs.
Schneier says this is about 10^17 bytes.

Very true.  I was not arguing that security should be reduces to the
lowest common denominator but that using excessively long key sizes does
little good.  Anything over 256 bits is, IMHO, overkill and 160 bits is
enough to make brute-force attacks infeasible.

I'm very suspicious of any cipher with independant subkeys.  Apparently,
this makes chosen-key attacks *very* easy.  Chosen-key attacks aren't
very practical, but it doesn't give me a good feeling about the relative
security of the cipher.  Some combination, like triple-DES using variable
S-boxes would probably be a little more secure.
