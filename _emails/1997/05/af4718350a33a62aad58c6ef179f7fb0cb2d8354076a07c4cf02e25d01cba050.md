I think the members of the privacy coalition suffer from the EFF syndrome.
The same syndrome that got us Digital Telephony, because the EFF got
suckered into believing that it "was the best deal we could get". Yeah,
right. The government managed to sucker the EFF then. Now, they are
suckering the members of the "privacy" coalition into supporting a law that
will gain us *nothing* we don't already have while potentially putting
citizens away for five years for the most minor offenses.

SAFE must be either completely rewritten (unlikely) or defeated.
