I'm not sure why this is of much interest to our list...ARPA/DARPA being
old news and all.

DARPA did not "intiate project ARPA" (??). Rather, the names have just
changed a couple of times. ARPA was changed to DARPA in 1969-70, in
accordance with the Mansfield Amendment's dictate that research be more
militarily directed.

A few years ago the name DARPA was changed back to ARPA. (But, last I heard
it was back to being DARPA again.)

There's an entertaining new book, "Where Wizards Stay Up Late," by Katie
Hafner, which describes some of the history of the ARPANet. (My university
was one of the first four nodes, so I had a primitive ARPANet account in
1973.)
