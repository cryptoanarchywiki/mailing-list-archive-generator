My version of Eudora, and, I think, the freeware version also, has a little
check box in the "Checking Mail" settings dialog which lets you leave
messages over a certain size on the server, where you can delete them
without having to download them. Since I'm on about 100 mail lists at last
count, including, of course, the SET-dev list, where such godawful
cluelessness (including, BTW, the use of multimegabyte .pdf, Microsoft Word
<including macro viruses, of course>, and ASN1 files :-)) is commonplace, I
have found this little checkbox a godsend.

I have mine set at 100k. It works for me.

Of course, Tim doesn't get to read this message, or any other, for that
matter, to do him any good this time around...

If we lived here, we'd be home now. Self reference is a dish best tasted
cold, I suppose.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
