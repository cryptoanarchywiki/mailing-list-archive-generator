Lucky's right on Bell's undue incarceration. 

There's more to the story than tax avoidance. Declan 
perhaps should look beyond the government's citations of 
law to examine the other allegations of intent to harm 
federal officials which did not receive substantiating cites.

The affidavit which prompted Jim's arrest was a potpourri of 
disingenuous spleen and bile and unintentional humor.

This appears to be another instance of the USG patchworking 
public menace and phlegm (the Kallstrom syndrome) when it's 
in its self-preservative and -promotional interest to do so. 

As Tim and cie often note, the syndrome's fountainhead is DC 
and world centers of ambitious regulators, enforcers and
promoters for "public security." Which is fast replacing 
national security, via dual-use sleight of hand, as a career 
trajectory.

Counterterrorism is the fastest growing governmental subculture 
at the moment, and no longer aimed overseas. Secret laws,
courts and committees are burgeoning, anticipating that the
public cannot be trusted to protect itself against the enemy
within, ahem, the Beltway.
