Indeed. All reasons to withdraw support for the Bill and to actively seek
to undermine and sabotage it, as I hope many of us do.

Further, it is quite clear that the Bill will *not* allow strong crypto (by
"strong" I mean "arbitrarily strong," the only kind most of us support!) to
be exported freely. Even for "financial cryptography," as clearly any
strong crypto system can--and wiil--be used eventually by some group the
Administration deems to be "international terrorists."

(I would classify the U.S. government as a supporter of international
terrorism, for many reasons. The mining of the harbors in a country with a
relatively freely elected government, for example. The support of Kurdish
terrorists. The funding and equippers of sappers in Serbia. And so on. Oh,
and does the use of PGP by Burmese rebels/freedom fighters/terrorists, so
often cited by Phil Zimmermann as a postive example, count as use by
terrorists? You get the picture. One man's terrorist is another man's
freedom fighter. I support, for example, the use of strong cryptography to
undermine the Zionist entity which preys upon the life of the people
(TM)...does this make me a supporter of terrorists or of freedom fighters?
And why do George Bush and Bill Clinton get to decide?)

Yoo're not "running the show," nor am I, or we, but you can withdraw
support and actively oppose a bad bill.

"Use a cipher, go to prison" will hardly engender more public support for
cryptography.

More importantly, what the hell does the SAFE bill have to do with
Americans using crypto? Crypto is completely unrestricted, at least by law,
anywhere in the U.S. for use by American citizens and (most) others. If
Americans aren't using crypto, it's for other reasons.

"Use a cipher, go to prison" will not help in this process.

Sorry, Johah, but these are just platitudes from a press release.

More detailed analysis is called for, not just mouthings about Congress
standing up to the Administration, etc.

For example, answer this question: Will "unbreakable" (*) cryptography,
using full-strength RSA and drop-in 3DES, IDEA, Blowfish, AES, etc., be
allowed for unrestricted export?

If "yes," then this is indeed a good deal. But the weasel words in nearly
every section clearly say it is not.

If "no," then crypto is still crippled for export...the details just vary
(or maybe they don't, actually, as nothing is spelled out).


(* "Unbreakable" is a dangerous term. By "unbreakable" I mean here an
algorithm and key distribution mechanism (or no KD, as in PK systems) which
surpasses any known breaking attempts by some comfortable margin. Cf. the
study by the noted cryptographers, and use keylengths like 128 bits of work
factor...that ought to be "unbreakable" by the standards of the next few
centuries!)

Importantly, the putative goals of the SAFE Bill could be much more simply
handled this way:


"SAFE -- Security and Freedom Through Encryption: Computer software shall
be treated as any other form of speech is. Software shall not be subject to
restrictions on dissemination, export, or possession."


--Tim May, still a felon, and still using encryption to further
prosecutable offenses. Fuck Congress.

[This Bible excerpt awaiting review under the U.S. Communications Decency
Act of 1996]
And then Lot said, "I have some mighty fine young virgin daughters. Why
don't you boys just come on in and fuck them right here in my house - I'll
just watch!"....Later, up in the mountains, the younger daughter said:
"Dad's getting old. I say we should fuck him before he's too old to fuck."
So the two daughters got him drunk and screwed him all that night. Sure
enough, Dad got them pregnant, and had an incestuous bastard son....Onan
really hated the idea of doing his brother's wife and getting her pregnant
while his brother got all the credit, so he pulled out before he
came....Remember, it's not a good idea to have sex with your sister, your
brother, your parents, your pet dog, or the farm animals, unless of course
God tells you to. [excerpts from the Old Testament, Modern Vernacular
Translation, TCM, 1996]
