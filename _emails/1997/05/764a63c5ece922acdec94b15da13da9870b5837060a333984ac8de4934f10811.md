Good point.

I happen to think that using the master key to decrypt documents is better
practice than using the master key to obtain copies of other keys, but I
can see both sides of this argument.

You are repeating your fallacy of assuming that the key safe (KS) case has
one policy for all users and the multiple recipients (MR) case has
different policies for different users.  The truth is that the two issues
(which model to use, and how many different policies to make visible to
the users' software) are orthogonal.  You can have KS with a different key
safe for each user, and you can have MR with the same extra recipients for
each user.

Sigh.  The same fallacy again.

In the KS case, the software must know which key safe to use and how to
secure and authenticate access to the key safe.

In the MR case, the software must know which extra recipients to add, and
the corresponding public keys.

In both cases, the software is affected to some minimum extent.  In both
cases, you can choose to make the software more complex by adding more
policy knowledge.  In neither case are you forced to add more than the
minimum amount of policy information to the software.

What I meant was, you can make n-of-m hardware stuff for both cases.
Surely you don't disagree with that?

Finding out which key to encrypt to in the MR case is analagous to finding
out which key safe to talk to in the KS case.  Securing and authenticating
the channel to the key safe in the KS case is an extra issue that does not
have a counterpart in the MR case.
