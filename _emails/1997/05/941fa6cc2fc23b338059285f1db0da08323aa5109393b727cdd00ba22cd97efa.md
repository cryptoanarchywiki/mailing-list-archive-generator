[btw what do people think of the practice of putting To: cypherpunks,
and Bcc: coderpunks@toad, cryptography@c2 as I have done here?  I do
this for stuff when I'm interested in comments of people who are on
cryptography but not cypherpunks, similarly for coderpunks to avoid
the non-crossposting issue with coderpunks, and avoid extra moderation
work for Perry with cryptography.  I know you get multiple copies if
you're on all lists, how else does one reach you all?  Myself I have a
procmail recipie which junks multiple copies, like:

:0 Wh: msgid.lock
| formail -D 128000 msgid.cache

]

My announce was rather hurried, and someone suggested to me the use of
a proxy as an architecture for interfacing to the eternity service
rather than the cgi based system I have.

The person who suggested this to me also described some work on a
"universal proxy framework" which is designed to enable things like
"cookie-cutting, onion routing etc."  Also it was suggested this is a
cheaper way to implement a proxy.

Here are some comments on possible architectures for an eternity
service.

There are a number of places where one might put a eternity server:

  - cgi script on your ISP for yourself and others to use

  - cgi script and local web server on your dial up linux box

  - standalone eternity proxy running on an ISP

  - local proxy

  - proxy framework module (local or remote? does it support both)

  - apache module "eternity proxy module"

  - browser plugin (if this has the power to do it)

My ideal interface would have been a web proxy, as this allows the
user to transparently integrate this into their browser.  You may be
able to set your browser to use the proxy to handle *.eternity, and
have the rest go direct, but I'm not so sure on this point.
Regardless, the proxy can forward requests as cacheing proxies do for
documents not in *.eternity.

My first consideration was to get a proof of concept going as quickly
as possible.  What you are looking at is a weekend hack + 3 days
debugging and cleaning up.

Proxies have higher user requirements to set up, you need root, or at
least ability to leave processes running indefinately, and some
mechanism to restart them on reboot (or do it manually).

My cgi-bin implementation allows you to run with cgi access, and cron,
or at a pinch to do without cron even.

Local proxies have higher development costs, in that it involves
windows code to be of use for the majority of users, which has much
higher development cost.  The universal proxy framework (which I am
not familiar with) would allow a local proxy to be implemented more
easily if I understand correctly.

Local handling of at least the last layer of decryption would help
from a security point of view.  Or the local proxy could be a full
eternity server for your own use.

The ones I've made possible with my cgi based implementation are the
first two, I chose them over proxies simply because they are the
easiest to implement first.

Basically what I have implemented is a poor mans remote proxy or (with
a local webserver) a poor unix person's local proxy.  You give it URLs
of the form:

  http://www.foo.com/cgi-bin/eternity?url=http://blah.eternity/blah/

The cgi script modifies on the fly URLs in documents (if they are type
text/html) and involve *.eternity to have prefix:

  cgi-bin/eternity?url=

Well actually it copes with local, and site relative urls also (where
site is the eternity virtual site).  Normal URLs are left as is.

Proxy is the more elegant way to do it as you don't have to re-write
urls on the fly.

There are advantages to running the server (proxy or otherwise) on an
ISP rather than locally:

- if you're using the cgi solution and an SSL web server you get SSL
  encryption on the link.  This way people don't get to see your
  requests, if they are handled locally by your ISP from it's news
  spool.

- it has lower bandwidth requirements which may be an advantage, as
  you don't have to down load all the eternity documents, only the ones
  you want to read as you browse them

- if the eternity server is running on your ISP and the ISP has a
  local newspool people outside the ISP can not see your requests go
  to the NNTP server to see which articles you are reading.

There are some advantages to local proxies:

- you don't rely on the ISP or the eternity service operator not to
  log exdirectory URLs, and not to log your accesses.  (However note
  that your ISP can observe your use of the NNTP server, unless you
  protect against this by saving all eternity web pages locally, so
  that you never have to do a NNTP lookup per article).

- if you are accessing URLs which are private (encrypted with a
  password inside the final layer) you don't need to give this
  password to the server to get it to decrypt for you.  (You don't
  need to with the remote proxy, but you get back a PGP message which
  you then have to manually decrypt, unless you can figure out a
  browser plugin to automatically decrypt PGP documents on the fly as
  they are read).

A local proxy used in combination with remote proxy or cgi-proxy would
allow another architecture.  Your local proxy obtains it's article
hash -> message-id/newsgroup/article-number database from a real
remote eternity proxy which is watching news as it comes in.

Then it can fetch the articles itself with lower overhead.

Another architecture (moving more towards Anderson's meaning of an
eternity service) is the idea of forwarding requests between eternity
servers.  In this way the eternity servers would be "remailing" your
requests.  If your entry point into the eternity service network was
via an SSL protected link, and the links between the eternity servers
were encrypted, the eternity servers as a whole would disguise who was
accessing what.  You could allow proxying of normal web pages too, and
create a distributed version of anonymizer.com as a side effect.
