I once unintentionally forgot to delete the "cryptography@c2.net" cc: on a
reply I made to what (I assumed) was a Cypherpunks message, and received a
Perrygram stating that my message was off-topic and was not welcome on his
list.

Clearly Perry has the right to run _his_ list any way he wishes to, just as
Declan has the right to run _his_ list any way he wishes to, just as Bob
Hettinga has the right to run _his_ list (or lists) as he wishes, and just
as Lewis McCarthy has the right to the run _his_ "Coderpunks" list as he
wishes, and so on.

However, I think these "personal" lists are not to my taste, I don't want
Perry or Declan or Bob or Lewis deciding whether my articles match their
interests at the time I submit an article.

I routinely delete all of the cc:s to other lists, figuring if people want
to read my stuff they can damn well subscribe to the Real Thing, the
Cypherpunks list. No censorship (modulo the John and Sandy Show in
Jan-Feb), and no control freaks trying to limit discussion to the things
that happen to interest them that week.
