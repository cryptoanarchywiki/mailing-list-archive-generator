+Remember: if you comment on the fact that one can't examine this
+product's source code for security holes, you'll get threatening
+letters from C2Net's lawyers: Helena Kobrin, Cantor, & Siegel.

    attila sez:

    well, as far as I am concerned, bully for Sameer's lawyers. anyone 
    who does not provide source code for an [in]security product, 
    particularly one based on an open source product HAS SOMETHING TO 
    HIDE.

    anyone who refuses to show his code not only has something to hide,
    but has probably SOLD OUT to our invasive creeping slime 
    non-representative government.  

    Bill Clinton had the audacity to say at UConn something to the 
    effect:  "...censorship [loss of freedoms] is the first step on the 
    road to tyranny...."  $%&* HYPOCRITE!

    lawyers are lawyers, they make great emergency rations, and they
    taste like chicken, really.

          I had to kill because they were in the way.
