Matt Blaze posted the following to cryptography/coderpunks.
Looks like potentially cool stuff. I had to use 
ftp://research.att.com/dist/mab/proxy.ps
as a URL, but that may just have been Netcom DNS weirdnesses.

>Abstract:
>
>This paper introduces {\em proxy cryptography,} in which a {\em
>proxy function,} in conjunction with a public {\em proxy key,}
>converts ciphertext (messages in a public key encryption scheme or
>signatures in a digital signature scheme) for one key ($k_1$) into
>ciphertext for another ($k_2$).  Proxy keys, once generated, may
>be made public and proxy functions applied in untrusted environments.
>Various kinds of proxy functions might exist; {\em symmetric} proxy
>functions assume that the holder of $k_2$ unconditionally trusts
>the holder of $k_1$, while {\em asymmetric} proxy functions do not.
>It is not clear whether proxy functions exist for any previous
>public-key cryptosystems.  Several new public-key cryptosystems
>with symmetric proxy functions are described: an encryption scheme,
>which is at least as secure as Diffie-Hellman, an identification
>scheme, which is at least as secure as the discrete log, and a
>signature scheme derived from the identification scheme via a hash
>function.
