John Painter, the Oregonian reporter of Jim Bell's
arrest, said this evening that he's got another
story coming out tomorrow that will reveal more
of the situation, and that he'll fax a copy (which 
I'll post unless Alan does).

Mr. Painter says:

Jim's still in the Tacoma, WA, federal jail. There was
a prelim today and a hearing is due Friday.

The feds are keeping the case documents sealed.

Speculates that someone may be squealing on Jim 
in a deal.

Jim cannot receive calls but can call out collect.

A U.S. Federal Defender has been assigned to 
represent Jim: Peter Avenia, tel: 253-593-6710. 
Mr. Avenia did not return a call.

The U.S. District Court Judge is J. Kelly Arnold. 
Court Clerk is Kelly Miller, tel: 253-593-6313.

The Oregonian's telephone: 1-800-452-1420.

A man at Jim's home politely said he did not 
want to talk about it. Tel: 360-696-3911.
