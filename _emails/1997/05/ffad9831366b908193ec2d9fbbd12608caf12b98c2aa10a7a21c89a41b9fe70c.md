Demento Vulis 's reheated, refurbished, and regurgitated auto-spam is
completely inappropriate for the mailing lists into which it is auto-spammed
by his inbred evil spam-bots.  Demento couldn't write a single lick of
cryptographic code if his NSA masters and his KGB brothers paid him for
it. But truth be known, he sells his spamming software to Cyberpromo
and their ilk, and gets paid in anal sex performed on him by large testicled
bulls - often without applying vaseline in his cavernous anus.

He has killed many bulls in this manner.
