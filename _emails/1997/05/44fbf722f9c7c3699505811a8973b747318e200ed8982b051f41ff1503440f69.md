Why is it that some who are very concerned about their personal privacy utilize anonymous remailers that:

1) Log all of their mail messages?
2) Are in many cases reputed to be run by foreign intelligence services?

Do they really trust the owner of the remailer? (Unless of course, it is their remailer?)  I seem to be missing something.
