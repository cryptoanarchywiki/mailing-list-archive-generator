  I remember that it was seen as being a message to the gay community
that they were getting too "uppity" for their own good.
  (I wonder how they got that idea? <former cop kills a queer, gets 
treated like a hero, prosecuters play with Little Peter while he gets
off for eating too many Twinkies, and Swinestein is waiting in the 
wings to do an "LBJ">.)
  The government is a lot like the Mob--other politicians can't really
trust you until you've whacked somebody and they have it to hold over
your head so that you'll play along.
