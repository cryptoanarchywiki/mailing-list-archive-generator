The difference in all these cases (save mine) is that the people you listed 
would have been persecuted, if not prosecuted, for their actions.  Now 
people are hiding out of fear and paranoia of something that in most cases 
doesn't exist.  The people you mentioned never had to deal with this level 
of abuse, either.

In my case, it's simply the name i've old my email package to append to my 
messages.  Anyone who really wants to can look me up at any time.
