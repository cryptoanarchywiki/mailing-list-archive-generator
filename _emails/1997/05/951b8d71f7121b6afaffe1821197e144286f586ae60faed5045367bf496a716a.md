           Worcester Polytechnic Institute
                 5-Day Short Course

        APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY

          Seminar Leader: Dr. Christof Paar


Many of today's information technology applications have data security
as a central system requirement. Applications such as wireless computer
networks, electronic commerce, and many www applications rely heavily
on a high degree of system security.

This five-day course will provide you with an in-depth introduction to
the field of applied cryptography. Virtually all important aspects of
public-key and private-key algorithms as well as protocols will be
introduced. The course keeps the theoretical background and technical
applications well-balanced. You will leave the course with a solid,
broad knowledge of state-of-the-arts cryptography. You will have skills
to carefully choose and design a security scheme for a given
application.

Background Note: The seminar is based on a highly successful course
which has been taught to more than 150 professionals in industry and
graduate students on campus.



                  COURSE OUTLINE

Day 1, AM - Introduction

Principles of cryptography. Classical algorithms. Attacks on
cryptographic systems.

Day 1, PM - Private-key algorithms

Day 2, AM - Private-key algorithms

Data Encryption Standard (DES): Function, performance, implementation,
security. Overview on other modern block ciphers. Key length and
long-term security.

Day 2, PM - Usage of private key-algorithms

Operation modes of block ciphers. Multiple encryption. Key whitening.

Day 3, AM - Public-key cryptography

Introduction. One-way functions. Some number theory.

Day 3, PM - Public-key algorithms

RSA: Function, performance, implementation, security. Recent attacks.

Day 4, AM - Public-key algorithms

The generalized discrete logarithm problem. Diffie-Hellman key
exchange. ElGamal encryption. Elliptic curve cryptosystems.

Day 4, PM - Protocol building blocks

Digital Signatures. Hash Functions. Security Services: Privacy,
authentication, integrity, identification, non-repudiation.

Day 5, AM - Key distribution

protocols. Course summary.


                  WHO SHOULD ATTEND

Engineers and other technical professional who develop, implement, or
assess information security applications in software or hardware.
Technical managers who need a solid understanding of data security
issues will also greatly benefit from the course.


                 ABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR

Dr. Christof Paar leads the Cryptography and Data Security group at WPI's
ECE Department. His research interests include security issues in wireless
