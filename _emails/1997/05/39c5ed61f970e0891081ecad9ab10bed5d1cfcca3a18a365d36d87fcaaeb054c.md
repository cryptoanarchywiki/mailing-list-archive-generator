You quoted my post, and I have usually been one to take the extra time to
change "cypherpunks@toad.com" to either "cypherpunks@algebra.com" or
"cypherpunks@cyberpass.net". Sorry that I did not in this particular case.

All three addresses will work, though it is unknown how long the toad.com
version will continue to work...I assume we'll get some warning if John
decides to stop sending the messages on.

There is also an "ssz.net" address that may also work, which Jim Choate
uses (and runs).
