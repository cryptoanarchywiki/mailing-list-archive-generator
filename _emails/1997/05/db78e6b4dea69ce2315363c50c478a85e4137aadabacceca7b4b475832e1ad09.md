The current troubles for Jim Bell, and the representation in
government affidavits that casual speculation with friends over
infrastructure vulnerabilities constituted some sort of
conspiracy to do harm, should make all Cypherpunks nervous.

Indeed, such discussions about vulnerabilities and risks have
been a central theme of this mailing list over the years.  I hope
I don't wake up tomorrow morning to headlines in the Seattle
Times reading "Atomic Force Microscope Central in Duvos Smartcard
Plot" or some equally silly thing, based on an out-of-context
grep of the Web archives.

It is unfortunate that in a country which advertises itself as
some sort of bastion of free speech, one must constantly guard
ones speech to make sure that it contains no snippets suitable
for an inflammatory sound byte on the evening news.

Just another of the many manifestations of "The Policeman
Inside."
