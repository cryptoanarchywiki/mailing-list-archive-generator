Actually, that's not true.  Check out the Rogaway/Kilian paper.

It says that, if you've got 2^p known plaintexts, DESX has an effective
keylength of at least 118-p bits.  So, for instance, if you've got 2^32
known plaintexts, DESX only has an effective keylength of 86 bits.

In short, 3DES is (roughly speaking) stronger than DESX.
