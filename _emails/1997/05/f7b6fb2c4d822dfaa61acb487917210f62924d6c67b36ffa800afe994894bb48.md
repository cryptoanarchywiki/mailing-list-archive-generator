I agree fully. I know of at least one other indipendant node that will be
coming up in the near future. I am also in the process of putting in a
satellite location to my current site about 30 miles east of Austin to
better serve that part of the community. That site is intended among other
things to host backup servers for the various services of CyberTects. Among
these will be a server to run the various mailing lists in case of a primary
site incident. It will currently be connected via modem but a switch to ISDN
or ADSL is in the works. We also hope to kick the primary SSZ site up from
ISDN to ADSL in the near future as well. I can't at this time provide even
tentative go-live dates, but I will be digging a power trench there this
afternoon if it quits raining, then we have to install the phones and air
conditioner.

Things are improving but only slowly.
