With the congress so woefully uninformed that they confuse password 
protection with cryptography and naive enough to believe that 1.9E6 
possibilities represents a serious roadblock to entry, it looks like we have 
a major education effort to perform.

It is interesting that there were no examples in this summary of crypto used 
for communications -- but that's completely consistent with what we've been 
hearing all along.
