I have recieved only 2 messages from cyberpass today while I have received
27 from algebra no stats for toad as I am not subscribed to that list.

I am just finishing up my script to collect, log, & merge the two lists. I
hope to add in the news groups also to produce a daily cypherpunks digest.

I should have somthing up and running after I meet a production deadline
this weekend.

I could add some list analysis to my code producing a weekly and/or daily
report on the status of the various lists.

Let me know what kind of info you would like to see in the report and I
will see what I can come up with.

Also what would be a good size to split the daily digest at if it gets too
big?

Thanks,
