When:    Tuesday June 3, 1997 7PM
Where:   Nashua, NH Public Library, 2 Court St, Nashua, NH.
Topic:   Technology and social consequences of digital commerce and
         financial cryptography.
Speaker: Robert Hettinga, founding moderator of the
         Digital Commerce Society of Boston.

The NH INTERNET SIG (Special Interest Group) welcomes you to its
monthly meeting, the first Tuesday of every month.
The next meeting
is on June 3rd and will focus on the technology and social
consequences of digital commerce and financial cryptography.
Mr. Hettinga is also general chair of Financial
Cryptography 1997, the world's first conference on Financial
Cryptography. However, financial cryptography, the technology which
underlies digital commerce in its most secure form, will have much
more profound implications than merely the simplification of sales and
distribution. It permits us to make anonymous *cash* transactions for
everything from a billion-dollar foriegn exchange trade to, probably,
the switching of internet packets themselves.  If this promise is
kept, it could change the fundamentals of our entire society.

Please check out Mr. Hettinga's web site:http://www.vmeng.com/rah/

This meeting promises to be fun and informative for both the technical
and non-technical computer users.
