I'm curious about the "such psychological experiments are banned today"
assertiokn.

Are you saying that if I were to announce such an exeriments at the next
physical Cypherpunks meeting and ask for volunteers that I would be
breaking some law?

Or are you saying instead that most university researchers are now unable
to get grant money from the NSF and CIA to do such experiments?

Or that any professor who publishes on such things may face disciplinary
action from his university?

Big differences.

Insofar as I understand the law, so long as extreme physical torture is
avoided, no laws cover such experiments. (Many religions are in fact
organized along these lines, a la the Moonies, the Krishnas, etc.)

(And extreme physical torture may also be legal, a la S & M and consenting
sex practices, depending on one's jurisdiction. In San Francisco, even the
mayor attends S & M parties.)

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
