I have checked the cypherpunks archive following my comment that I was 
not getting much mail from the list (only 8 to 10 posts per day) over the 
last 2 or 3 days, and the archive confirms this. Igor and Jim have 
confirmed that algebra and ssz are up, and cyberpass is reponding to 
majordomo requests...

I`m just sending this to check that this really is not a list problem, as 
of course 10 posts a day is an uncommonly low traffic level for the list.

Unless of course the black clad ninja`s have come round on 4am nomex 
hooded raids, and you are all in the ministry of love being questioned 
over allegations of thoughtcrime, which would explain the lack of posts 
;-)......
