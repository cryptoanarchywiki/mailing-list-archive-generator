Exactly, pity that isn't what you stated in the first place.

Sorta defeats the whole concept of 'inter-linked lists' doesn't it? The
point was to make it easy for ANYONE who wanted to participate. If you
exclude parties because they won't do it 'your' way what is the difference?
Nada, null, nill, zero, nothing.

I can see it now; "oh, if you want to be a member you have to run this
set of scripts that automaticaly subscribes you to the other lists and you
can expect repeated querries of your subscription database. Oh, by the way
you are also agreeing to have other lists subscribe and unsubscribe their
user lists to your site at their operators whim. Oh yeah, and if they get
really clever they can have you shipping subscription lists of your
membership all over the place as well."

Sounds so much like the FBI going to the library for loan records and
denial of service attack it isn't even funny.
