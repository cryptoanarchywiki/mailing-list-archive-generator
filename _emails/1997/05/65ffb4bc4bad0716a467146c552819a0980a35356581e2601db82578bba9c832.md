This story is from the Oregonian May 22, 1997 Page D3:

Arrest solves mystery of law office stink bomb

A federal investigation that led to the arrest of James Dalton Bell 
of Vancouver appears to have solved a longtime mystery regarding a 
stink bomb attack in a downtown Portland law office.

In late April 1984, someone broke into law offices at 1123 S. W. 
Yamhill St. and poured a liquid on a hallway run that was so 
odorous it made at least one of the lawyers who smelled it vomit 
twice.

At the time, Nick Albrecht, who still practices law there, said the
skunklike scent, called mercaptan, was so overpowering that he had 
to go home because he could not stop gagging.

The target of the stink bomb attack was lawyer C. Douglas Oliver, 
who now lives in Southern California and won't discuss the incident.

Bell was arrested Friday on a federal complaint charging him with 
obstructing and impeding the Internal Revenue Service and the use 
of false Social Security numbers.  The complaint said that documents 
found on Bell's computer boasted of the mercaptan attack on the office
of a Portland lawyer who had sued him.

The lawyer was Oliver. Albrecht said Oliver had suspected that Bell
might have been behind the mercaptan attack, but could never prove it.

The federal complaint also charged Bell with the March 16 mercaptan 
attack on the IRS offices in the federal office building in Vancouver.
On the following day, when employees returned to work after the 
weekend, several of them had to be placed on leave because the smell 
was so powerful, the complaint said.
