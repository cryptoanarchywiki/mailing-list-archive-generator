Folks,

The DES key search is making serious progress. The leading contender 
seems to be DESCHALL http://www.frii.com/~rcv/deschall.htm

They are currently searching >3.5 billion keys per second. Estimated time 
to completion is 14 weeks.

It is no longer a question if the key will be found. We now need to make
sure that it is found as quickly as possible. 

Please download and run the software.

Thanks,
