As you say, Cyberpass clearly states that they are strict about not
allowing illegal activities.  They also state that they keep logs of
incoming telnet host information and will turn it over if an account is
used for anything illegal. 

I am not sure what kind of applet scheme you have in mind.

It seems to me that anonymous remailers and anonymous telnet services are
very similar.  The major difference is that latency (natural and
otherwise) can be used in remailers in order to help foil traffic
analysis, but would render an anonymous telnet service useless. 

With sufficient bandwidth an anonymous telnet service could chop up
packets and send them through other services in order to further obscure
the matter.  Something like what Mix does?

Has this been discussed on the list before, and if so, is anyone working
on something like this?

Perhaps the best that could be done at this point would be more along the
lines of obscurity than of anonymity.
