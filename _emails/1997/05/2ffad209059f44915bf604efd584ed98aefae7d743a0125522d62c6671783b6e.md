A couple of news reports on the Key Recovery
critique by Blaze et al from NYT and C|Net:

   http://jya.com/krnews.htm

Both cite Reinsch of BXA's counter-critique.

And another report on Sybase getting BXA
approval for export of 56-bit crypto without
key recovery. However, it's only for data storage
not communication. The story also reports that
Sybase will be allowed to export 128-bit
crypto with a key recovery plan.

And, baiting another barb, Senator Kerrey has 
entered the outline of his crypto bill in the 
Congressional Record, along with a statement on 
natsec and commerce and privacy need:

   http://jya.com/kerrey3.txt

So the Administration seems to be tickling the market, 
sending up balloons, wet fingering the air, pulling head 
out, and so forth, to see who might be induced to
succumb to the strategem of bait-and-bribe, trot-line 
eager minnows of ga-ga commerce in the national
interest, ahem, like those survivalist national labs,
Bell Labs, Lincoln Labs, Mitres, SAICs, and, their
patrons at National Security councils, departments of 
commerce, defense, state, energy, justice, et al.

Tim and Blanc are right, it's no holds barred Dual-Use
Civil-National Security War for the nation's goodies, 
no matter what fur's feigned to outfox the hounds and 
poachers and encroachers.

It would be swell if the NLs truly competed with industry,
but not likely with all those federal advisory groups
eyeing and spying and lying each other.
