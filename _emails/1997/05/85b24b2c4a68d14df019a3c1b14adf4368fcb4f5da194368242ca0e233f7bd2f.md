On Tim's war underway:

It is not McVeigh's type of ANFO-munitions that threaten
the legal-financial-governmental interests but the uncontrolled
munitions available to wage war on public policy, commerce, 
legislation, funding, regulation, intelligence, surveillance 
and law enforcement.

There has been an astonishing range of such munitions 
discussed on cypherpunks in the three years I've been around, 
and there's much more in the archives (handily collated in Tim's 
Cyphernomicon).

Crypto is central, to be sure, but hardly the only munition, as
many often remind.

Indeed, it is noteworthy how many of the broad range of these
potentially destructive munitions are not regulated by the EAR
and other regimes.

As with chemicals, explosives, bio-organisms, mathematics, physics,
it takes highly skilled people to advise the regulators on what
needs control and when, and not just the finished weapon, but its
components and sub-components. (As an example, see ATF's latest 
list of explosives: http://jya.com/atf050497.txt )

The war underway is often waged at secret councils of scientific
information and intelligence used by all government and
military agencies (meetings are listed in the Federal Register,
regularly reported on jya.com).

So it is not the known terrorist-munitions that are worrisome; it's
the ones not yet publicized but known to scientists, warfighters and
keepers of secrets who keep their fingers crossed and plan for
the worst -- say, the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure
Protection (http://www.pccip.gov/ ).

It would be instructive to post here uncontrolled munitions 
available for the war underway, with comments on how to elude 
control of the burgeoning domestic and global regimes.

I'd like to host a running Uncontrolled Munitions List (UML) on jya.com.

To be sure, some of that information might be submitted by remailer
or prudently encrypted. Use my public key if no other suits:
