It has been said that the greatest lesson learned from the vietnam 
war by the military industrial complex, was the need for effective 
disinformation and its role in dividing groups that would otherwise 
hang together against a common enemy.

Applied to the home front this translated into "identity" politics. 
To break up the antiwar and youth movements of the 60s, everyone 
was defined as a minority with their own agenda and lexicon. 
Feminists, Vanishing White male,  Black Power advocates, 
Gays/Lesbians,  christian peaceniks, hispanic farm workers, etc each 
was pitted against the other by underscoring their departure points 
in a machevelian plan to divide and conquer those that had united 
against the war and the MIC.

For the most part this has been extremely 
successful and any meaningful dialogue on a national scale has long 
been next to impossible because of it.

List members should be the first to rise above the base tactics of 
the enemy. We need to develop a language of inclusion that unites all 
of these seemingly disparate peoples against the common enemy.
