this deals with a sci newsgroup being moderated, which
is an exception to the "unmoderated" rule.

Given the subject, the attempt to limit the content is
going to be tough.  What do you do with the religious zealots
which say "God does not like frozen people" ?

You had better specifically define what a "personal attack" is.

You may never limit my ability to call you a "motherfucker" in any forum,
and if you call that a "personal attack" then you have a censorship
problem.

And what about crossposting?  Does the charter put any limit on that?
Any limitations on that are Unconstitutional.

Exactly, and anonymity is a constitutional right.
