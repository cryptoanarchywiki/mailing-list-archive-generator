Betreff: 	RE: Good book on stegano?

Hi everybody, hi Deepa,

1) Maybe the tutorial/review is being written in some university or company, 
e.g. for the planed 2nd Int. Workshop on Information Hiding or other 
publications or internally. Who knows?

Because there have been several seperate publications and first compilations 
in various media in '96 and I haven't yet found any technical paper about 
steganography published in 1997. Has anybody?

My feeling is everybody is reviewing right now!

2) Actually there are already at least 2 BOOKS dedicated to steganography:

 - "Disappearing cryptography" by Peter Wayner (pcw@access.digex.net),
the review of which can be found in the CIPHER newsletter #19 (or was it 
18?) & #20.

[How to get first contact with Cipher, "Newsletter of the IEEE Computer 
Society's TC on Security and Privacy" :
BACK ISSUES:
 There is an archive that includes each copy distributed so far, in ascii,
 in files you can download at URL
 http://www.itd.nrl.navy.mil/ITD/5540/ieee/cipher/cipher-archive.html
 There is also an anonymous FTP server that contains the same files.
 To access the archive via anonymous FTP:
 1. ftp www.itd.nrl.navy.mil
 2. At prompt for ID, enter "anonymous"
 3. At prompt for password, enter your actual, full e-mail address
 4. Once you are logged in, change to the Cipher Directory:
    cd pub/cipher
 5. Now you can request any of the files containing Cipher issues in ascii.
    Issues are named in the form: EI#N.9612  where N is the number of the
    issue desired and 9612 captures the year and month it appeared.

3) To answer your question anyway, I would advise you to take a look at this 
nice page I've discovered recently (NEW: it's 1 month old!) :

http://www-nt.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de/~hartung/watermarkinglinks.html
Thanks to Frank Hartung by the way.

Here you will find easily several links to past BIBLIOGRAPHIES for past 
years,
and also have on overview of what's the hell is happening !!!

Good readings,
Sylvain
