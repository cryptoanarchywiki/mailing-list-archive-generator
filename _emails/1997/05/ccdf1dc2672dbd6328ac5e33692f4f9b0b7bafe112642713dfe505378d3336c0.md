This week we've taken one of the net's most respected magazines - and 
curried it. That's right, we proudly invite you to feast on the Curried 
Issue of Shift Control, a veritable korma-copia of spicy treats. Our 
menu includes every curried delicacy ever invented - plus one or two 
that Shift Control's own masters of masala have cooked up themselves...

The starter: Poppadum will eat itself (a poppadum taste-a-thon).

The main dish: A tour through the three levels of curry house, from the
corner kormarama to the true viceroys of vindaloo.

The side dishes:
Curried thumbs - a tasteful selection of microwavable curries.
Curried songs - from 'Korma Chameleon' to 'Vindaloo Sunset'.
Curried Spice Girls - if the Girls were curries, what kinds would they be? 
Curried films - featuring 'Last Mango in Paris' and other screen platters.

Also on the menu this week...

The best curry of the millennium and a quiz to test how wild you are about 
curry - all with a rich and fragrant smothering of instant granulated Chip 
Shop Curry Sauce. Mmmm.

We also cater for those who prefer British fare with a fine selection of 
fiction, including your chance to win Â£200 - a lot of curries - by entering 
our short story competition.

So give yourself a tasty treat and partake in our sumptuous offerings, all
of which are hot, steaming and awaiting your delectation  at

Shift Control is produced by the Guardian's New Media Lab with help from 
Boddingtons and Stella Artois Dry
