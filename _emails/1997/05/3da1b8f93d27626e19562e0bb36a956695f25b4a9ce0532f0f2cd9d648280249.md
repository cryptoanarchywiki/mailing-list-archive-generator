Yes.  And probably a lot less design and programming than the key-safe
mechanism.  (For example, PGP already has an "encrypt-to-self" option
that makes it add the user's own key as an additional crypto recipient
of all messages; changing that to the more general "encrypt to this list
of extra keys" should be quite easy.  But designing and building a key
safe sounds like a lot of work to me.)

Of coure, you trust the users not to use versions of PGP that do not
make the corporate key a recipient of all communications, right?  If
not, then you also don't trust them not to use keys that have not been
sent to the key safe in the CAK model.

In the key-safe model, you have the problem o distributing information
about a change in location (network address) of the key safe, or a
change in the keys used to authenticate access to the key safe --
similar complexity in both models.

You can use special hardware to generate the key pair and to store the
private key -- again, similar issues and similar solutions in both
models.

In either model, you can have the users' software do the same thing
every time (talk to teh same key safe, or encrypt to the same additional
key every time); and in either model you can have the users' software
do different things depending on policies (talk to different key safes,
encrypt to different additional recipients).

It's unfair to say "but I choose to do the same thing every time, and
you choose to do different things every time, therefore my model is
simpler than yours".  In fact, both models are almost equally capable of
being used in either the simple way or teh complex way.

Again, the same scenario plays equally well in the
extra-crypto-recipient model.

I don't see how.
