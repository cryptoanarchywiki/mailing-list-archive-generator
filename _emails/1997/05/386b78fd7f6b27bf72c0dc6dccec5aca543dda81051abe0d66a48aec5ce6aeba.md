-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I'm very happy with the PGP 5.0 beta after less than an hour of testing.

The new PGP 5.0 seems to work well.  I'm finding a few bugs, and I had a 
configuration problem or two.  But this is much better than using the DOS 
version from Windows.  And much nicer than using Private Idaho.

For crypto to have widespread acceptance, crypto must work seamlessly on 
common platforms such as Windows.  While any Linux administrator can use PGP 
without much problem, the average Windows based knowledge worker has had 
problems with this.  PGP seamlessly integrates with Eudora and provides 
features required for electronic commerce.

I have used the keyserver lookup feature (from PGPkeys) and found it worked 
well.  PGP options have been added both to the Eudora menu and the toolbar.  
While I was not able to download PGP on Friday or Monday (day), customer 
support worked with me, and the technical people installed server updates to 
the US verification process on Friday and Monday afternoon, allowing me to 
finally download the 5MB file tonight.

PGP 5.0 takes advantage of the 32-bit APIs and uses the Win95 interface.  My 
existing 2.6 keyring was imported with no problem, and I have been able to use 
PGP 2.6 to verify signatures created with 5.0.  Best I can tell, the new 
product is backwards compatible with older versions.  I've also gotten email 
from a PGP person who has assured that source code will be available later.

The new product, when combined with Eudora seamlessly integrates

 * Email
 * Spell checking
 * Digital Signatures
 * Certification Authority (CA)
 * Web of trust
 * Encryption
 * Availability from a commercial source

This seamless integration is what is required to allow for successful 
implementation of Digital Signature initiatives most states have passed or are 
considering.

Overall, I'm happy.  I'd recommend that people obtain the beta and test it 
out.  I don't know what it will be selling for, but I'm sure it will be worth 
the price.
