The problem is that capital gains can be used to pay people money
and avoid income taxation.

Example: suppose that I hire you to design my website. Instead of
paying you $10,000, I sell you a security for $1,000 and repurchase it
from you next year for $12,000. As a result, you would not have to pay
the feds anything if there was no capital gains tax.

There are many ways in which this can be done by individuals and
companies alike.

I would rather use sales tax and repeal both capital gains tax and
income tax, than get rid of capital gains tax but not of the income tax.
