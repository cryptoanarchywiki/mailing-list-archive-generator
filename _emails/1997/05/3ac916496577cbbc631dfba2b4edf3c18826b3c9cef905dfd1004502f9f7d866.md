IANAL, but in this case it looks like the IRS was involved from the 
beginning.

And to establish motive.

Is it perhaps possible that, since the charge includes the idea of
"interfering" with the IRS, that there was an element of
"intimidation", and so on, that there may be specific clauses in the
statute cited that may have bearing?

It also seems to me that the IRS has a potentially strong case.  Given
that, what would be Bell's likely sentence, and how much could he
reduce it with a plea bargain? It certainly seems like the
weapons/AP/poison_gas/sabatoge stuff makes it *much* harder for him to
plea bargain (which may be why it is there).
