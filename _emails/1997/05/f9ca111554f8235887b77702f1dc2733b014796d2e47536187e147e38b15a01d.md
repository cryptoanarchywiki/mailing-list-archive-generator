I'm not so sure that this is realistic.  I have heard that earlier
fingerprint reading cards were very sensitive to size distortion --
that is, if you swung your arm in a circle to increase the blood
pressure in your hand, they would give a false reading, because of the
swelling in the fingers would be sufficient to throw off the
recognition software -- a smart card isn't *that* smart.  A problem 
of false negatives.

If you cut off a finger the blood pressure will go to zero, and the 
dimensions will change quite a bit, relatively speaking.

You don't have to kill or maim some to induce cooperation, and
biometric devices can be designed to pretty much require that the
subject be living.  Extortion or seduction are both quite viable, and 
work with any security system.  Biometrics don't really add 
anything.

Your point is just as meaningful for cryptography.  All strong crypto 
does is move the weak spot around.

Incidentally, I have heard (from a probably reliable source) that the
best biometric is a retina scan -- very reliable, hard to spoof,
*very* few false negatives.  [False positives are real bad for any
security system, of course.  False negatives are why you want back up
modes of access.]
