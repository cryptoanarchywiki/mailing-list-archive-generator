Just in case someone hasn't heard about this yet, we support a stealth
preference in 4.0 to turn of referer headers.  If you wish to disable
referer, you can place the following line in your prefs.js file:

pref("network.sendRefererHeader", false);

There is no UI checkbox for this preference because it was added after
we froze the UI.
