Depends on who is trying the case.  Judging where the article in the paper
was 
at, and the lack of other media coverage, I expect them to make a quiet 
example of him.  (i.e. punish him in a way that the people interested in the 
case feel threatened but does not give the rest of the sheep any ideas.)

I don't think so.  I am amazed they have not mentioned the guns that were 
seized.  I am willing to be this is the first salvo in a very quiet and very 
dirty little war.

Maybe we should start an anonymous betting pool as to which one of us will be 
the next to be arrested.

Where is Declan when you need him? :>

>(Wouldn't a better use of AP be to target AP, so to speak?)

I was very tempted to set up a demo AP server just to see what kind of
targets 
people would select.  (I do not believe that most people would select 
government employees.)  The slogan "Who do you want to kill today" has such a 
nice ring to it...  In order for such a system (or anarchy in general) to 
work, the general public has to be more aware of the type of state they live 
in.  With all of the "Bread and Circuses" that people are being subjected to, 
little wonder they are going along with the show.  (There are also a number
of 
psychological studies that show that people will do all sorts of horrific 
things to their fellow man when someone in authority tells them to.  If they 
are led to believe that they are "bad" in some way, many will enjoy it.)
