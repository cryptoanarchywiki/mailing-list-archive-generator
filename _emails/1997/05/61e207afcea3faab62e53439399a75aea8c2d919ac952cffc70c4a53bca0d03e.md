Hey, doofus, the article was 840 words long, 40 words longer than the length
recommended by the newspaper.  It ALSO avoids any mention of cryptography,
or digital cash, both of which would have not only just confused the average
newspaper reader, but  would have ballooned the article far past the length
that the newspaper could reasonably consider publishing.

Repeat same point above about length and detail.

They certainly had access to it.  The guy I talked to at the newspaper
claimed he had read it.
