Well, I think it's been some months since we last talked about the ethics
of having the Ruby Ridge shooter, <CENSORED>, marked for killing by
rightist bounty hunters. (I hear he's changed his name, and may even be in
the Witness Security program, according to a little birdie down at the
range.)

We talk about the things Paine, Franklin, Madison, Jefferson, and other
Founders would probably have talked about were they writing today. (I'm not
comparing our discourse to theirs, in quality or quantity, for lots of
reasons. But certainly some of the more fiery speeches of Mr. "Give me
liberty or give me death!" would surely raise the same flags that our
(theoretical) discussions of initiating infowar against Congress raise.)

Also, my tag line, "Death to tyrants!" is straight out of the Founders' mouths.

(Sadly, we now have several hundred thousand tyrants, mostly in Washington
and state capitals, who have richly earned this fate...something the
Founders would be screaming for action about.)

I've since found a dozen or so of these clips. Circumstances have motivated
me to look through some of my packed boxes.

Indeed. Lock and load.

We talk about the topics of interest to us. If the media characterizes us
as "crazies" or "militia members," or as "terrorists," this is just par for
the course. If, however, police departments and intelligence agencies mark
us for harassment, arrest, prosecution, forfeiture of assets, etc., then
this is what guns are for.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
