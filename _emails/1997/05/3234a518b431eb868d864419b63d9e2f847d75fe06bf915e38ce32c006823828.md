We now live in an age where, in between the slumber of the soap operas 
and the bewitchment of 'prime time,' we are fed our opinions and 
world-views in catch-phrases and ten second sound-bytes. 

At the same time, Gomez sees to it that there is enough trouble and 
turmoil in the world that the World Leaders, even in democracies,
can chip away at human and individual rights under the guise of dealing 
with various 'threats' that they, themselves, have concocted as a means
of retaining power over the masses. 

Even as the governments of the world strive to bring everyone and 
everything, however minute, under tight control and regulation, Gomez 
and the Dark Allies are behind the scenes, helping to guide the 
development of a technology that will, along with television, be 
the ultimate weapon in their struggle for the domination of all 
mankind---the Computer.

The rich and powerful have managed to lull us to sleep with the 
hypnotizing power of television---stealing our thoughts and our 
reasoning processes in our slumber, feeding us our reality via the 
airwaves...according to the 'official' party line. 

The government and the media have placed us on neat little shelves 
where we are numbered and labeled according to their own wants and 
needs. We are allowed the illusion of freedom of thought, and 
individual choice, as long as we have our 'Freedom of Thought Permit
1136.51.709' and don't stray too far from the permitted paths. 

In the great battles of the past the Dark Forces have always been 
beaten by the individuals scattered in the secret places, living 
unnoticed in obscurity. Living quietly and unobtrusively, forgotten 
about in the madness storming the land, they have kept alive the 
spark of Thought and Reason. They were able to go quietly about 
their work, making contact with the individuals who were ready to 
escape the madness and work towards restoring Sanity in the land.

This time there will be no escape. Every man, woman and child on the 
face of the earth will have a dossier documenting their life from the
time of their arrival on the face of the planet.
Information gleaned from the Department of Motor Vehicles, their Social
Security Number, banks, credit cards, magazine subscriptions, 
charitable and political contributions. 

When Gomez removes the masks of his human allies, revealing them as 
dark agents who have been rewarded with wealth and power for doing 
the bidding of the Evil One, the names of the misfits and 
wrong-thinkers will be spit out of the computers at the speed of 
light---to be rounded up and disposed of in the opening salvo of 
the new Holocaust. 

   Excerpt from "The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre" (1989)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I first read the above work in 1990 when it was considered by some to
be Orwellian in scope and by others to be paranoid babbling. Since then
I have watched the underlying theme of the work come to fruitation
slowly but inexorably.
Since my first reading of it I began taking steps to secure my files
and communications and in the process I discovered cryptography. In
1990 that made me a paranoid oddball to be viewed with skepticism.
Now there is a name for my disease: Cypherpunk Syndrome.
