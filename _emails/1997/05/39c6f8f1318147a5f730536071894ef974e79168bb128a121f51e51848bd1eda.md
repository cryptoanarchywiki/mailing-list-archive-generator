Hmmm... I'm hearing a lot of "you have a right so long as it doesn't 
interfere with me" kind of talk here... if the gentleman has a right to 
spam, then this person as the same right to spam him back.. I personally 
detest getting crap like the guy sent in my mailbox.. filtering doesn't 
stop it from wasting bandwidth.
