I looked over the log details the you provided and this is rather odd.


I am currently working on some logging features for my next release of
E-Secure. The purpose of this is to aid the user with keyring management. I
plan on keeping the log files encrypted and having this a user selectable
option (the user can turn logging off if he wishes). The contents of the
PGPWS_32.LOG seems to go beyond what would be need for this purpose though.

I'll have to boot into NT (yech) and take a look at what it is doing.
