Well that is another issues that I had not addressed in my post: The
Userping of powers relegated to the Legislative Branch by the Excutive
Branch via Executive Order.

If Congress was intrested in doing the "right thing" then law they should
be passing should be quite small stating that the Executive Order is
Unconstitutional and by an Act of Congress is Repealed.

This is not what they are doing. What they are saying with SAFE is that you
have no Constitutional Rights on this issue but because we are nice guys we
are going to pass a law making it legal, oh by the way we are going to tack
a few riders on here for our own purposes.

The whole approach to this issue is wrong. There is *no* valid law
restricting the export of crypto. Any attempts to enforce such an invald
law should be delt with in the courts. I find that it sets a scary
presedent that I *need* congress permission before I can exercise my
Constutionally Protected Rights.
