[This post cc cypherpunks@algebra.com & cypherpunks@cyberpass.net to
aid propogation which seems to be struggling.]

In trying to figure out which lists were working, I noticed that there
are now many more people on coderpunks and cryptography than there are
on cypherpunks... take a look at these figures:

  713 cryptography@c2.net
  713 coderpunks@toad.com
  245 cypherpunks@algebra.com + cypherpunks@cyberpass.net - duplicates

Seems to me many of the `cypherpunks' have become `careerpunks' and
are now more interested in trading crypto tips, trade gossip, than in
cypherpunks projects.

They went through the phase of buying kewl domain names (take a look
down the subscriber lists), tinkering with remailers, and have now
graduated to making money from crypto consulting, and lost interest in
the issues where they don't add to the bottom line.

Oh yeah, I know you might argue that selling crypto is a good thing,
and it is, but the two are not completely focused in the same
direction: corporate, or consulting interests want to sell crypto, to
export crypto, cypherpunks want tools to increase the power of the
individual.

An example of this different focus is perhaps the SAFE bill.  Lots of
corporates seem keen on SAFE, because it increases their market place.
Individuals right to use crypto in the US can go to hell.

Before anyone leaps down my throat, the above is a gross
generalisation, and is intended as food for thought only.  I know
plenty of you who are involved in the crypto business and who haven't
lost your ideals, and think SAFE is a bad deal, etc.

However, I think the trend exists.
