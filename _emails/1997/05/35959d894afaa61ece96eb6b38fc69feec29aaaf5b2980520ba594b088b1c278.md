Jim, I made a two line off-the-cuff generalization about a case that 
*could* be argued -- a tiny, infinitesimal mote in my world view.  So 
don't go overboard with the hyperbole, OK?

Remember that since my world view includes numbers, Godel's theorem
requires that it is incomplete or inconsistent, as is yours. 
Regardless of how our world views may change, they will continue to
include numbers, and so will remain inconsistent or incomplete.  And
incompleteness and inconsistency are global properties of a system...

It simply doesn't matter.  The important point is that governments
*are* much larger in much larger countries.  We are speaking in gross,
general terms here -- we haven't controlled for type of government,
whether the military is included -- a whole host of factors are left
as free variables, and yes, even modulo those variables, there is lots
of scatter.  But in 1800 there were about 5 million people in the US. 
Now there are close to 300 million. 

The basic point, really, is that organizational complexity grows 
with the size of the organization, at a greater than linear rate.  
This is because organizational complexity is a function of 
interactions between members of the organization, which is at least 
n-squared.  (However, when you consider that alliances form and can 
interact, the true complexity grows at a much faster rate.) 

(Another confounding factor is growth in complexity of technology and 
human knowledge.)

Jim, have you considered the interaction between religious beliefs and
AP? You apparently don't have direct knowledge of this, but after a
certain level of economic security has been reached economics becomes
a much less important as a motivator [Maslow].
