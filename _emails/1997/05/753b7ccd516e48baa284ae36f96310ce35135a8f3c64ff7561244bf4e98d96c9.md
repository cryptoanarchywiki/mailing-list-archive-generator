I made a comment to the person next to me, yeah, it's Ms. Denning.  Kahn 
replied "No not really"  Interesting that he'd know...

More interesting was "So, that's all key escrow will do? Let us catch

Yeah, that did suck.  'was cool that he was sitting right next to me.  
For a while it gave me major spookies that Ms Denning was "eyeing me"

And of course Mr. FBI Scott (What's the last name) said it was total 
bull. :)  How would he know if the NSA was doing it and he was working 
for the FBI?

sides of this before, nothing new here..."
