Well that sure got buried by the "Truth Above All Else (tm)" press. Not
surprising however.

We have so many laws in this country, doesn't one of them prevent
"discrimination" based on dollar value of corporation? ;)

How about extortion... "You must be a large company paying buttloads in
taxes and making sizeable contributions to the administration to receive
license to use PGP overseas..."

Can't we use this against them and force the license to be extended to
everyone?
