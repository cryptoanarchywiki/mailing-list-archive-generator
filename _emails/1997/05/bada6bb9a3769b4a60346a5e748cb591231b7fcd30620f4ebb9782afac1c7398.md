Dave Emery has pointed to an article, "The E-Bomb - 
a Weapon of Electrical Mass Destruction," which
describes the work being done on EMP weapons.

The piece is at Infowar.com, but we've borrowed
a copy to put at:

   http://jya.com/ebomb.htm  (93K + excellent diagrams)

It may help explain that unearthly blast in the Aussie
Outback discussed here a few weeks ago. Someone 
suggested HAARP as an explanation, and another hinted 
at other godawful research being done that similar to what 
the genius Tesla was doing early in the century to 
shatter the planet and fry the sky, and now, it seems, 
coming true.
