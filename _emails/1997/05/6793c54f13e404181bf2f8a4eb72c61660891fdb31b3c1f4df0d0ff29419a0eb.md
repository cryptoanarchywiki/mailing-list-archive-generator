I was watching the national news broadcast a picture of the key to
the Ryder truck that was purportedly found near where McVeigh's car
was allegedly parked.
  I thought it would be an interesting project for someone with the
proper technological tools to take the picture and add a graphic of
the "bloody glove" beside it.
