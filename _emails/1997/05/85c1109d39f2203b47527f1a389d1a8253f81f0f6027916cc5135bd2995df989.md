Has any progress been made in cryptanalysing the algorithms used in the 
european Videocrypt and Videocrypt2 standards used to encrypt satellite 
broadcasts?

Particularly, is there any information I can obtain about the protocols, 
the data communicated between the decoder and card, and the algorithm itself.

I am looking at the possibility of a new version of the "season" card 
simulator software created some time ago, which is now obselete, which 
used to be used against videocrypt broadcasts...
