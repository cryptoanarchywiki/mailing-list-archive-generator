algebra never responds to pings.

The reason why your article did not go through is because majordomo
thought that your article was an un-sus-cri-be request.

I am very annoyed at the extremely unintelligent behavior of majordomo:
instead of bouncing messages to cypherpunks-owner it should bounce them
back to posters. It should also do a better job at identifying admin
requests.

cyberpass is also subscribed to toad.
