Well the whole thing is just more smoke and mirrors.

The bomb used in Oklahoma required the knowledge of CHEM 101. I have
several Eng. Books that go into great detail on making Nitrogen/Deasel
bombs as they are routinely used in Mining operations. They are safe to
store as a convenient binary explosive, easy to store, and easy to prepare
as needed "on site" not to mention they are relativly cheap to use. :)

I would imagine that you will have to pass a FBI/CIA/NSA security clearance
before you can enroll in collage in the near future. :(
