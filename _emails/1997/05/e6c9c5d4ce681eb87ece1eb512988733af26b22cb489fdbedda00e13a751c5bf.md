There is a need in the Internet community for an unencumbered 
encryption algorithm with a range of key sizes that can provide 
security for a variety of cryptographic applications and protocols.  
This document describes an existing algorithm that can be used to 
satisfy this requirement.

This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
this memo is unlimited.
