Thank you VERY MUCH for releasing the source code. This shows that you are
serious about your program and truly appreciate how important is the process
of review as far as your credibility is concerned.

I have downloaded your code and looked at it. Looks rather interesting
(especially the part below). What I did not understand, however, is
what is SetVal and how it works. Also, I was not clear how you set
variables AE1, AE2, ..., AE10 and so on.

As far as I understand, you use these variables to select the particular 
encryption method. Do you normally select only one method on some random 
basis or you use several passes?

Also, some may be interested to look at this particular encryption
method (I added some indentation and comments for readability). I believe
that it is not particularly strong.

for B1 := 0 to 255 do

for B1 := 0 to 255 do
begin
  1000:
  B2 := Random(256);
  if Used[B2] then goto 1000;
  EncTable[B1] := B2;
  DecTable[B2] := B1;
  Used[B2] := True;
end;

    FileRead(AccFile, Block, Copied);
    for I1 := 1 to Copied do
    begin
      Block[I1] := Block[I1] xor Random(256);
      Block[I1] := EncTable[Block[I1]];
    end;

    FileWrite(AccFile, Block, Copied);
