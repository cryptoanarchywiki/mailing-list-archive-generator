     Ammonium nitrate could be made by a terrorist, or it could be stolen from a construction site, since it is usually used in blasting, because it is very stable and insensitive to shock and heat.  A terrorist could also buy several Instant Cold-Paks from a drug store or medical supply store.  The major disadvantage with ammonium nitrate, from a terrorist's point of view, would be detonating it.  A rather powerful priming charge must be used, and usually with a booster charge.  The diagram below will explain.

     The primer explodes, detonating the T.N.T., which detonates, sending a tremendous shockwave through the ammonium nitrate, detonating it.
