SIT IN ON LIVE FCC UNIVERSAL SERVICE HEARING: WEDNESDAY MAY 7, 9:30AM ET

The future of Universal Service in the nation's telecommunications network
is one of the key elements of our nation's communications infrastructure.
At issue - how to ensure that citizens who live in rural and inner city
areas have access to advanced telecommunications services, and how to pay
for it.

The 1996 Telecommunications Reform Act directed the FCC to answer these
questions.  After nearly a year of investigation, hearings, and public
comment, the FCC will announce its rules on Wednesday May 7th.

You can join the proceeding live.

Be present, ask questions, and get answers from FCC staff after the
hearing. (FCC staff are not allowed to comment on a matter before the
Commission before the commissioners have made their ruling.)

Best of all, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt will join democracy.net on Tuesday May
13 for an online town hall meeting.  Hundt will discuss the Universal
Service proceeding and respond to questions from Internet users.
