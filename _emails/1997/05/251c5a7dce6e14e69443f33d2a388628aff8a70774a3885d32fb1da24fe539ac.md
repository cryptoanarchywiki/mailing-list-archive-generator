I suppose I am developing a reputation amongst the Inside the Beltway Cyber
Rights Groups (tm) as a pain in the ass, but nearly everytime I see one of
their chief spokeswonks giving a policy statement I realize they are "not
on my side."

The latest quote is from Marc Rotenberg, on a CNN piece on spam and
anti-spam legislation, saying that what the legislators in Congress really
need to look into is how the spammers develop their data bases.....

Incredible. Does he propose investigations of private data gathering?
Perhaps search warrants served on those who take public postings and
construct data bases?

Look, I'm annoyed by getting 5-10 "unwanted" spam messages a day. But I
realize the "spammers" are merely  taking publicly available (= legally
available, as 99.99% of all such information is) information and using
legal channels to contact me. I may not "like" it, but their behavior is as
legal as someone calling me on the phone.

(And ny nearly any measure of hassle factor, dashing to get to the phone
only to find it's a salesman selling something I don't want is worse than
any 20 unwanted e-mail messages.)

So, Marc Rotenberg wants Congress to "look into" (= interfere with)
compilation and use of public information.

These people are NOT our allies.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
