ANFO is an acronym for Ammonium Nitrate - Fuel Oil Solution.  An ANFO
solves the only other major problem with ammonium nitrate: its tendency
to pick up water vapor from the air.  This results in the explosive
failing to detonate when such an attempt is made.  This is rectified by
mixing 94% (by weight) ammonium nitrate with 6% fuel oil, or kerosene.
The kerosene keeps the ammonium nitrate from absorbing moisture from the
air.  An ANFO also requires a large shockwave to set it off.
