I think that the Government is trying to make an example of Mr. Bell.  I
think 
that much of the charges reported in the news are flase.

Here is why...

1) They claim that Jim was actively trying to disrupt 911 service and poison 
the Bull Run water supply.  These are non-political targets.  Jim only thinks 
in political targets.  (I remember trying to get him to come to grips with
the 
idea that such a system as AP would not be used just for government types.  
That is would be used against anyone who had enemies.  Could not even make a 
dent...)

2) The warrent is sealed, yet the media is reporting all sorts of things
about 
the case.  Where is the information coming from?  Sounds like planted 
information to keep people from complaining too much when they send him up
the 
river for a few years...  (Whether he survives long in custody is another 
story.  I would be willing to bet that if he does not "cooperate" that he
will 
have some sort of "accident" while in government hands.)

3) The suspected crimes list keeps changing.  How many times has the 
"official" story changed?  Each time it gets more and more lurid.  (And many 
of the crimes are ones that get used against damn near every case the 
government tries against someone who threatens the security of the state.  
Belief starts to wear a bit thin after a while...)

Of course, i do not expect anything like the truth from standing in the way
of 
a conviction...

"Paranoia strikes deep...
  Into your soul it will creep...
   It starts when you're always afraid...
    Step out of line, the man come, and take you away..."
