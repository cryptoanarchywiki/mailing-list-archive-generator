This is really a double tax since if you own assets, you've already paid
taxes on those said assets in the form of income tax.  If it's an
inheritance, that too was taxed, so what the fuck?  What's the
justification behind this other than exit rape?

I suppose one way is to take loads of trips and loads of AmEx traveler's
checks, then gamble on things with 50% chance of winning, take the
winnings and dump'em in accounts outside.  Repeat until nothing's left,
then exit with very little.

So let's sue the system.  Might fail, but maybe we can get it the fuck out
of our income taxes.  One less tax to bother with.  Since it no longer
does what it is supposed to, might as well get rid of it.  One way is to
calculate how much you've put in it, and what is expected you'll receive
on retirement.  Compare the two, then sue the bastards.   (I donno what
I've been smoking, but I should get more of it, that's for sure. heheheh)

Not worth wasting the disinfectant IMHO.  I'd say take the money, purchase
the favors of AIDS infect whores and throw congress and the senate a
really big party. :)  Oh, and make sure the condoms have holes.
