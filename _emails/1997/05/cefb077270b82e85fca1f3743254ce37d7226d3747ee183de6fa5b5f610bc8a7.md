This is nothing new. They did this to the Military Payroll back in the mid
1980's. Most if not all civilian Fed workers are already receiving DD
payments.

Their has been a long time desire by the Feds to move us to a cashless
society. No checks, No cash, no coins all electronic transfers. This is
just one more step in that direction.

While from an economic standpoint there are many reason to do this as it is
much cheaper to move bits than to move pieces of wood pulp. From a
security/privacy standpoint there are just as many reasons *not* to do
this. Smart Cards, Debit Cards, Credit Cards, ... et al. will not support
anonymous transactions. The current power brokers will not give up control
of the money regardless of what form it takes.
