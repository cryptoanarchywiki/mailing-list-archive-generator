News from the Beirut of the West:

The FBI, in cooperation with the Portland police and the TV show "Cops" is ending a six month survelence project of downtown Portland.  Tonight, armed with large books containing pictures of suspects, they have congregated in the center of town arresting all of those caught in their video web.  Over the last 6-8 hours they have been arresting hundreds of suspects in the downtown area.

The arrests are a "show of force" in the downtown area.  The police used to watch over the people.  Now they are watching the people.

Expect to see similar activity in the town where you live.

"Be seeing you!"
