Eudora does have a "Only download messages less than ___K" option
that can reduce this problem; I don't know if there's also
a way to delete the message from Eudora without downloading it.
Netscape Mail has similar options.

The old Netcom Netcruiser mail client software let you download
just the headers and then pick what messages to read ; I don't know
if the new NetComplete stuff does that or not.  Netcruiser was ugly
and somewhat broken, but occasionally did useful things.
