some of the best hacks that I heard was to install a trojan
instead of, say, cat, that would randomly change one byte in 
a randomly chosen file.

this is hard to notice, and when you do notice that, all the backups are
useless.

basically, install lots of backdoors and then play with their minds.

some ppl would steal CC# of their customers and publish them, but I would
not do it.
