	The place we really want the redundancy is in the alphabet
used, not in the data.  Most OCR systems have clever algorithims to
figure out that that blob after a 'q' is really a 'u'.

	To take advantage of this, you could encode everything in
RFC1751(?, S/Key style) word lists.  The expansion factor is extreme,
so use gzip --best.

	Alternately, you could turn off context sensitivity on your
scanner, and use an alphabet of abcdfgijknopqrstuvxyz (depending on
your font--in lucida these are all pretty dissimilar, using a
hueristic of 'more than one led bar' different.)

	With some experimentation, you might be able to expand that a
bit with punctuation and numbers.
