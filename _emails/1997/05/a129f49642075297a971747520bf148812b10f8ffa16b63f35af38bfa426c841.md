Reminds me of an old astronomy club trick.

Take any reasonble aperture telescope. Use a reasonable magnification for
the target such that target window fills the field of view. Place a
standard electronic flash where the eye normally is. (Increased efficiency
is gotten by arranging for as much of the output to go into the eyepieces
as possible...this can be done with an "integrating sphere," e.g., an
aluminum foil sphere with a single exit at the eyepiece.)

After dark, aim the telescope in the window of your victim. Best results
are gotten if they have the lights off, e.g., while they're watching
television.

Trigger the flash.

The startled reactions as their room fills with a flash of light are
interesting. Some of them may even think they're under nuclear attack.

This of course works best from afar. Apartment buildings with views of
other apartment buildings, for example. Don't this from the bushes, or even
from across a street.
