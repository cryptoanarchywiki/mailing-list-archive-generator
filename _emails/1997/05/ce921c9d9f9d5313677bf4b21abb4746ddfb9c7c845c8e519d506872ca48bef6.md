	Yes they do. There is a growing international crypto
development industry. The export controls have hampered access to the
products they need, but it has not eliminated said access.
	SAFE is one step closer towards making *import* of
cryptography illegal. It's a good thing Anguilla looks like a
relatively reasonable place to live, with people like you "on our
side".
