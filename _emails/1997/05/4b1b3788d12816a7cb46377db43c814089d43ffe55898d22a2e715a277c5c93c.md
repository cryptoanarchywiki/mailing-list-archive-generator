Coins are removed from the cash db when they are paid out. They are then
stored in the payments db along with the payment headers, etc. The blinding
factors are not stored once the coins have been paid. Regardless, removing
the payments db will not cause any ill effect (that I have noticed, except for
the obvious loss of payment records), so you can do that anyway if you like.

(Note, this is based on a hex dump of the payments db, so it's possible I'm 
wrong. Anyone from Digicash who knows otherwise, please correct me.)

Jeremey.
