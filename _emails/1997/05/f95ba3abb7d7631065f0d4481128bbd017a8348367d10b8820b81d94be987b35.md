Agreed.  As we all know, tax evasion charges have been used by the IRS when
the FBI has felt that it is unable to prove other charges.  Its use against
organized crime is a prime example.

While I do not practice in Fed'l courts, in state courts the specific statute
that a defendant is accused of violating must be cited.  Hence, since I am
not familiar with federal complaints, I did note with curiousity that Bell's
complaint specifically cites statutes that Bell allegedly violated regarding
the SS number charges and the failure to file income tax returns.  Perhaps,
the other acts, wherein no specific statutes are alleged to have been
violated, are mentioned as a means to make a showing that Bell is a danger to
the community and, therefore, a factor for asking the magistrate to set no
bail.

I would be, however, very surprised if it was *not* "scattered amongst the
various documents on his computer."

>We'll see what comes up during the trial.

If there is one.  As you stated above and IMHO based upon what I have read,
the IRS has a strong case regarding the SS numbers/tax evasion charges.  This
matter may very well be resolved via a plea bargain.
