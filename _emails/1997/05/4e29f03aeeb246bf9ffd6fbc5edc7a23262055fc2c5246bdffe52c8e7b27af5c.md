Exactly. I thought it was a mildly interesting idea, but much less
practical than using untraceable digital cash directly to hire hits. (And I
don't expect to be raided for this observation, by the way. Such
observations are obvious to anyone who looks at untraceable digital cash,
especially when ancillary services, like untraceable third party escrow
services ("You slay, we pay") are just as possible.)

Indeed, if he is tried his ideas will be spread far and wide...and some may
even think "Hey, let's try it, except let's target it toward collecting
money by our Irish friends for killing of British politicians and royals."
(As with Phill Hallam-Baker, this is how I think it will turn out. Ordinary
Americans are too sheep-like to donate money to have Janet Reno, for
example, killed. We don't get fired up in large enough numbers. Except I'll
bet (no pun intended) that a lot of whites would contribute to see certain
blacks killed, and vice versa.)

Now that Bell has been arrested, if he is _not_ tried, his fame is still
assured.

Probably covering their asses. Once his home was raided, and the case
publicized in the leading papers (apparently tipped off by the cops), kind
of hard for them to just back down and say "Oh well."

Some DA probably figures he or she can make a political name by prosecuting
the first case of "Internet terrorism."

Fucking fascists make Bell sound less crazy.

Lock and load.
