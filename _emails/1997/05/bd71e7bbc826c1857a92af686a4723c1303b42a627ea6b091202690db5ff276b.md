Regrettably, this depiction of the fall of the Roman Empire is incorrect.

During the last period of the Roman empire in the west, the empire was
both very weak, and extraordinarily brutal to its subjects, torturing
to death huge numbers of people on a scale no seen again until the
twentieth century.

Despite this they never encountered any resistance from their terrorized
subjects.

Only free people , and people who recently were comparatively
free, rebel.

A world government would not fall until it had tortured to death
such a large proportion of the population that there was enough
wilderness to protect runaways, or until its technological level
fell so low that its communications stopped working.
