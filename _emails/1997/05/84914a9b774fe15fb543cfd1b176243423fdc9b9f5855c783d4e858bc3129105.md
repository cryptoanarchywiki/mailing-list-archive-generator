Calling any democratic polotician, especially in the UK, sane, is a big 
mistake. However, if we may rephrase and ask if he is any less deranged 
we can safely answer "no".

I heard a wonderful comment on the cryptography@c2 list earlier that Jack 
Straw (the new Labour home secretary, who is in charge of law and order) 
may be defined as the only person for whom anal sex with michael howard 
(his predecessor) counts as masturbation. They both even look deranged 
(Michael Howard looked rather like a serial killer and jack straw looks 
like a church reject). I don`t know about crypto policy, Labour are 
supposed to be opposed to mandatory GAK but this is of course a small 
issue when put in perspective. The new labour administration are a group 
of anti-drugs, anti-"crime" misfits who I hope go the same way as the 
previous leader of the labour party, John Smith, who died of a heart attack.

Just to give you some overview of the fuck ups we now have governing the 
UK I present a list of proposals Tony Blair and his motley crew have made in 
the last year:

Mandatory minimum sentencing for repeat offenders regardless of the 
opinion of the judge.

State set curfews for all children under 16 regardless of their parents 
wishes.

Parents to be held responsible for the crimes of their children if the 
children repeat offend.

Several vague allusions towards internet censorship schemes or mandatory 
web page rating using PICS.

Minimum wage for full time employees, regardless of the empolyees skills 
or the wishes of the employer.

Further action to prevent "bias" and "discrimination" in the workplace, 
eg. "Employ this unskilled bone idle coon and we`ll lower your 
corporation tax 2%"

Further plans for yet more CCTV cameras in public places.

Mandatory ID cards for citizens (This one sounds like a joke, believe me 
it is not).

A ban on all handguns even when registered (currently all pistols above 
.22 are banned and all guns have to be registered in a process whereby if 
the applicant for a certificate has any history of political dissention 
or crime (eg. Smoking a joint, the ultimate sin against society) the 
certificate will be refused.

Yet more spending on welfare to support the pieces of shit in the gutter 
I pass every day.

I think this is an excellent idea, I`ll call or mail them in a few days 
to find out their pricing structure.

Absolutely, besides which, even though I believe in the right of people 
to be as bigotted and statist as they see fit, there are only so many 
causes we can support and coming in on the side of XS4ALL knowing their 
record seems ill advised to me. If they truly deserved our support they 
would retain the pages whether they were legal or not.

I actually went to the page once, nearly brought some bud but as I recall 
they didn`t have an SSL link so I chose not to transmit my CCN.

I don`t have a copy, but if XS4ALL have any balls at all they will send 
us a copy. I`ll get onto them about this later.

No, it isn`t really but was, for all intents and purposes, the best we 
had. I haven`t yet seen the eternal server idea but I`ll trawl the 
archives for it.
