Student faces felony for hacking grades

>From NewsTalk 750 WSB

A 15-year-old Florida High School student faces felony charges for
allegedly hacking his way into the school computer to change "F's" into
"A's." Jason Westerman claims it was only a joke, but he faces felony
charges for offenses against intellectual property and computer users. He's
been suspended for ten days. Westwood high school administrators want to
expel him.
