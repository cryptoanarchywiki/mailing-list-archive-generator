One issue with the system is that censors will issue cancel messages
for the articles.  Not too much which can be done about this.  Some
trends tend to help this problem:

Cancel message abuse by people running cancel bots reflecting their
censorous views have resulted in some sites ignoring cancel messages.
PGPmoose provides a better method of allowing only the author to
cancel.  Or NoCEM provides a ratings system framework, which is
superior to using cancels.

Another aspect of the system is that it relies on news archival
services such as dejanews and altavista; these presumably don't listen
to cancel messages for already archived data (? guessing here).  The
archive maintainers presumably don't want to get involved in disputes
over which old articles should be purged from their archive anyway.
