Please consider writing your corporacongressmyn and explaining to them
briefly, yet <politely> your concern about packet sniffers.  Hotmail's
market is exploding and they just might need a way to distinguish
themselves from their competitor American Express (usa.net=netaddress.com)
during the next year, even while they continue living on the edge with
weak push/advertising revenue.  Send no money, but these people deserve
our support:

 comments@hotmail.com       "New features you would like to see or
                            general comments about Hotmail."

Or,

 support@hotmail.com        "Assistance with using Hotmail's features or
                            technical difficulties with your account."

Remember, it just takes A MINUTE to...

 "contact Hotmail by phone: 408.222.7000 -- 10:00 am to 6:00 pm Pacific Time"
