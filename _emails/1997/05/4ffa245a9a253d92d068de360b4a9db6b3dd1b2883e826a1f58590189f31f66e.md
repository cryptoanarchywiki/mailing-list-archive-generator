I'm always amazed at the large number of people who don't know that you don't 
have to talk to the cops.  It's not just the 5th Amendment BTW.  You don't 
have to talk to them because you don't have to talk to anybody.  

Cops can give you orders to do certain things when you're out in public
(stop, 
turn left, etc.).  They can't order you to do things outside the limited
scope 
of vehicle and crowd management.  They can't order you to give them $20 and 
they can't order you to talk to them.  They can arrest you with probable
cause 
and detain you briefly for purposes of investigation.  They can ask you for 
your name and you may have to supply it, but that's about it.  If you're 
operating a motor vehicle, they can ask you for ID.  Not too much else.

Since cops are not judges, they can't order you to do things outside of the 
above.  You may be compelled to testify in court or at other sorts of 
hearings, but you *never* have to talk to cops.  And you never should unless 
you're asking them for help of some kind.
