I don't know about "dozens", but one convicted murderer named Richard
Snell had plotted to bomb the building about 13 years ago.  He was
executed on the night of April 19, 1995, the same day as the OKC
bombing.  There's in article in the February 24, 1997 issue of _Time_
(the one with the golden swastika on the cover) on page 28.  This
article contains similar information to an article at
http://www.aci.net/kalliste/okccol.htm and discusses, among other things,
possible knowledge of the bombing in advance by the ATF and evidence
that Tim McVeigh was associated with the Aryan Republican Army and Elohim
City.  There are a few other articles also at
http://www.aci.net/kalliste/ .
