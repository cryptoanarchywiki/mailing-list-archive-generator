hmmmm.. Go figure out how many years of your life you'll waste doing that 
once you calculate how many of these messages arrive each hour, let alone 
each day.  I, personally, have been on this mailing list for a while now, 
and have never seen *any* worthwhile posts from either of those remailers, 
or any other for that matter.  If you've got something to say, say it.  
Anything less is cowardice, in one form or another.

Or, if you like, I'll remove my spam filter and you can come hit my delete 
key for me...
