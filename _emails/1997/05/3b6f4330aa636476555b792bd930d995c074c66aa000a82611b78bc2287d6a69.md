Jim Bell has an editorial (with his picture) in the Oregonian. (Morning
edition, May 6th, 1997 page B-9.)  It takes up about a quarter of the
page.

It is an interesting read.  It does not address the problems with AP, but
it does deal with the raid and other issues involved.

Jim might consider posting a copy of the original article here.  Given the
Oregano's love of cut-and-paste journalism, it would be interesting how
the original and print versions differ.
