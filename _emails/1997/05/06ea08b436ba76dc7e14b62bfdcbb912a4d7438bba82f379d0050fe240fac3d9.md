We could find no listing of E-mail intercepts in the
tables, so it's not clear what the summary was
referring to beyond stating that "electronic mail"
was included under "electronic intercepts" along
with digital display pagers, voice pagers, and
cellular phones.

The tables list intercept information under two categories:
Type and Place.

Type:

1. Phone Wire
2. Micro-Eavesdrop
3. Electronic
4. Not Reported

Place:

1. Single-Family Dwelling
2. Apartment
3. Multiple Dwelling
4. Business
5. Roving
6. Other

"Other" is further listed as:

Automobile/Van
Briefcase
Cellular/Mobile Phone
Cemetary
Closed Circuit TV
Container
Digital Display Pager
Facsimile
Garage/Parking Lot
Hospital
Hotel Room/Motel Room
Jail
Mobile Home/Trailer
Package/Cargo
Pay Phone
Pen Register
Prison
Social Club
Storage
Telefax
Courthouse
Street
Computer

We found only a single instance where the "place" was
a computer.

BTW, the 193-page printed report is available free from
the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. 

Telephone: 202-273-2156.

Web site: http://www.uscourts.gov/

Folks there were quite helpful, so it's possible that you
might get E-mail intercept details from them by
requesting it. If you do, let us know, quick!
