I see.

Any chance you could fix the forwards up so they look like normal
posts?  Maybe stuff them into a file which procmail picks up without
doing the spam check?

I'm not sure why someone would want to do a Bcc
cypherpunks@algebra.com and Cc coderpunks@toad.com because (if I have
this right) it'll be cypherpunks which sees the Cc coderpunks, and
people on cypherpunks will auto-repy to coderpunks, which is the
opposite of what people on coderpunks want.  What people should do is
Bcc coderpunks (or cryptography) for this purpose.
