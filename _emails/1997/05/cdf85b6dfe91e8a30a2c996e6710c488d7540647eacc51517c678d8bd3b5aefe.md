Thanks Marc, for the efforts at clearing things.  The CDT letter was sent
to the subcommittee, for reasons we've all already talked about (that these
issues are better handled at the full committee).

The Internet Privacy Coalition letter, which we all signed, was sent to
Goodlatte and contains the following quote:

   For the reasons set forth below, we recommend that this provision be
   reconsidered when the COMMITTEE considers the bill. [emphasis added]

Note, that Committee means full Committee, not subcommittee.

-S
