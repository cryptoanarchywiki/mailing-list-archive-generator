I addressed many of your issues in another post, so I will be 
relatively brief...

True.

Not true.  The activities are quite different in detail.  In the 
multiple recipients (MR) case the coalition keymeisters get together to 
decrypt a single document; in the key safe (KS) case the keymeisters get 
together to decrypt a key, which can then be used to decrypt many 
documents.   In the multiple recipient case, therefore, the master 
key is potentially used quite frequently, and hence much more 
exposed.  There are many other differences: I won't try to go into 
detail here.

The frequent use of the master key is a major problem, because in the 
MR case, when a master key is compromised every document in the 
company is exposed; whereas in the KS case, given appropriate 
security around the keysafe, it is not anywhere as much of a problem.

Not if the encryption client encrypts to different company recipients
depending on a policy (which one might want if one tries to limit the 
compromised master key problem described above.)  Then the policy, 
contrary to what you state below, must be reflected in the client.

Sigh.  The situations are really quite different.  In the KS
case the policy never impacts the software; in the MR case I don't 
think you can avoid it.

Not at all.  The corporate master key is used to decrypt documents in the 
MR case; in the KS case the master key is used to get to the key 
database.  Two totally different functions, two totally different 
security paradigms.  The old saw -- you can either hide your eggs all 
over the case, and hope not too many of them get found, or you can 
put them all in one basket and guard the basket.

But a relatively straightforward storage problem, really.

Not so.  You have to exactly the same issue -- how does the user find 
out the master key to encrypt to?

Arguable.  Guv won't say "everybody has encrypt every file to the
government key".  Instead they will insist that the corporate master
key be escrowed.  Any master key is an easy target.  And they will
have very good excuses for it -- corporations are public entities, tax
records, etc, so I don't think the public will get worked up about 
it.  Corporations won't, either.

Note that the keysafe model doesn't really need a master key -- it 
will work with just good physical security.  In that case the Gov 
would just issue a subpoena, I guess.
