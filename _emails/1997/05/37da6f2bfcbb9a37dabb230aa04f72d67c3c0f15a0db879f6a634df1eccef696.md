Not "best".  "Easiest".  Look at it this way, Adam -- if it was easy 
to implement Carl's model, it would already have happened, given the 
dislike of key-escrow in the cryptographic community.  But, when 
examined in detail, in light of real requirements from organizations, 
it is not easy at all.

I'm not "scrambling", Adam.  If there is anything you need to
understand here, it is that I am *not* in favor of GAK.  Chisel that
in stone and think about it a bit -- your misunderstanding of my
motives causes you to gloss over my arguments and not think about
them.  I am sympathetic to your concerns, and I am trying to explain
something I truly think people are missing.  Think of me as 
intelligent, Adam, and I will do the same for you.

You completely missed the point of the above paragraph -- all those
questions apply to the "encrypt to policy-specified local recipients"
model, and *don't* apply to the key-safe model.  The key-safe model 
has no significant policy issues that need to be embedded in 
software -- the only policy is "when data encryption keys are 
generated a copy is sent to the key-safe (using an encrypted channel, 
of course)."

It follows, therefore, that if the master key is compromised in both
systems, all data is compromised.  From that perspective, the systems
are equally secure. 

> You fix the second crypto-recipient in the MUA if you wish to.

This is precisely the point I was alluding to in the policy discussion
above.  In an organizational content, *of course* you will put all the
complexity in the MUA.  The question is, how do you change the 
"master key" indicator that is in each MUA?  Suppose that the 
organization wants different keys for different departments -- how do 
you keep track of which master key goes where?  How do all those 
MUA's get their key policy module updated?

How does the key policy module in the firewall get updated?

???
With the key-safe model the firewall never enters into the picture.

No, I wouldn't argue that -- I know perfectly well that that neither 
model does any good at all against a determined, competent insider.

Two things:  First, any crypto system that doesn't deal with 
protection/recovery/secure-use of private keys is incomplete.

Second, keep in mind that we are talking about encryption for an
*organization's* purposes.  The whole meaning of "private" is altered
in that context.

You say "tumato"...

At that level of generality both these systems are identical, and 
equally easy to explain.  It's when you get down to the details that 
things become more interesting.
