Some of his statements could have been taken as advocating the killing of 
federal employees of various sorts.  The question is whether he actually
tried 
to arrange it in real life.  (Which I doubt.)

I found that part quite interesting.  I remember Jim going off about this 
(without refering to any specific method) at the first Portland Cypherpunk 
meeting.  He got pretty pissed when I mentioned it on the list.  (As well as 
my post that I thought he was a loon.)  Interesting to see that there is an 
actual method mentioned.  (And that his friend also thought it was kind of 
nutty...)

Neither can I.  Maybe it was supposed to short out the electronics.  Imagine 
what that would do to your lungs!  Youch!

It is interesting that they have kept the warrent sealed.  This, more than 
anything makes me question the legitamacy of the whole affair.  Sounds like 
the IRS is planning a preemptive strike on the Common Law Courts and the 
people behind them.

That is not explained.  I think it was an excuse to arrest him without having 
to reveal the real reasons.  Be interesting to see what they accuse him of 
later...

The IRS seems to have overstepped a little in this case...  The sealed 
warrents are an attempt to keep it from being examined in more detail.
