Your response is most interesting!  It almost implies you can't publish
for(i=0;i < filesize(B); i++) C[i] = A[i] ^ file_contents[i];

I wonder why the difficulty in simply (I thought of actually going ahead 
and doing this):

Take a posting (B.) to cpunks by Tim May.  THese get disseminated quite
widely and he's well-known; his thoughts and style should make deniability
of the message difficult.

Calculate C = B ^ A such that A = kiddie porn of your choice.

Post the UUENCODE of C. to cypherpunks, send the binary to Tim, etc.

Call your favorite Agency to investigate.

Your variant in which the file B. is known, as in KRNL386.EXE is also viable,
if not more so!

Is posting a TRANSFORM such as a 'OTP' that converts copyrighted material A
into copyrighted material B a violation of anything, I wonder...  You could
convert everybody's Internet Explorer into a ZIP file containing a setup
and executable for Netscape 3.0!!
