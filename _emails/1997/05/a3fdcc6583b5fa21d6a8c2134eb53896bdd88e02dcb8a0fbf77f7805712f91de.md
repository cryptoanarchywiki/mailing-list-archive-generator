Duncan,
  You have to keep in mind that these deaths were all necessary 
in order to curtail drug dealing and pornography. (Although it
gave rise to a sharp increase in necrophilia.)

  I read a passage of a book long ago in which a historian recounted
a number of different fallen dictators known for bloody purges who
reminesced that if they had controlled their moments of "softness"
(translate~~killed more of the right people) that they would still
be in power.
  I wonder if Hitler's final words were, "Well, they won't have
Adolf Hitler to kick around, anymore."
