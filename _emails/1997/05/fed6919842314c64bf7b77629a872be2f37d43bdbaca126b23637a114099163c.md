I wasn't advocating either:

a) any "forcing" of anything

b) any compliance with scripts, cooperation, etc.

Instead, imagine this "service":

- a distribution point (= list) which subscribes to all of the various
lists (cyberpass, algebra, ssz, etc.)

- it sends out to subscribers the first instance of any message it receives

- duplicates (see discussion below) would not be sent

- it would, ideally, be on a robust machine

The "duplicates" issue has been discussed by others. Even if message IDs
are not enough to find duplicates--someone reported that the same message
from algebra and cyberpass have different IDs--I would think that using the
sender, message title, and date of origin ought to be more than enough to
spot duplicates.

Thus, the message "Re: The Interlinked Cypherpunks Lists? (fwd), 4:34 PM
-0800 5/13/97, Jim Choate" should be unique.

No, this is just another filtering service, one designed to collect
messages from as many inputs as possible and send them out, without
duplicates.

No one has ever said you, or SSZ, or anyone, has to participate.

"Get a life." What an original insult.

Reminds me why you usually reside in my filter file, Jim. Back in it you go.
