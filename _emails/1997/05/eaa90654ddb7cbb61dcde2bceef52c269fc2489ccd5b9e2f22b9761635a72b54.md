I checked the www.pgp.com site and saw no evidence of source code.

Anyway, I decided to go ahead an take a look at PGP 5.0, the Macintosh
version (someone said it was only for Windows/NT, but this appears not to
be so...perhaps by "only" the person meant "no DOS version"?)

Alas, the lookup is too dumb:

"Please accept our apology for any inconvenience, but at this time we
cannot permit a real-time download of the
       product you have requested. The specific problem encountered is:

              InterNIC does not know who `tcmay.got.net' is.

              Sorry. "

I'll have to get it off the Iraqi or Syrian sites.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
