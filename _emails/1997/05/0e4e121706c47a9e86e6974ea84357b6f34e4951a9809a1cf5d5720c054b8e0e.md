Blair has learned his Clinton lessons well.  When I see the evolution
of so-called multi-party systems where all candidates will fuck with
your rights equally well, it makes me wax fondly back to the old Soviet
Union.  Although there was only one party, the citizens were at least
able to vote "None of the Above."

I wonder how many seats would be filled in our government if the last
step in the electoral process was a ratification of a single candidate
by the voters.
