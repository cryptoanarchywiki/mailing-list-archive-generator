Hi There,

I have come up with a way to reduce latency and improve reliability of
cypherpunks@algebra.com node, by way of tinkering with DNS and mail
aliases at a friendly site.

I plan to implement the new scheme and then seamlessly transfer 
cypherpunks@algebra.com to a better connected host. This transition is
supposed to change NOTHING in the way cypherpunks@algebra.com looks
to its users, subscribers, and peers. It is also supposed to be painless
to the subscribers. Operation of cyperpunks@algebra.com will NOT be 
interrupted at ANY time.

However, whenever computers are involved, there are things that can go
wrong. You will also receive some number of test messages. I hope that
you will understand that and I will take all steps to prevent any 
inconveniences.

Thank you

igor
