This is all away from the main point, I have a large dislike of arguments 
which rest entirely on practical grounds, anarchic societies may be more 
violent, this does not offer any reason why they should not be the 
correct type of societies from an idealogical and moral point of view.

This argument does have certain substance but it does have flaws:

Firstly, all religion which has caused conflict in the past has been one 
which wielded power in a governmental fashion. I`m no historian, but I 
cannot recall one incident where a religion which had no executive power 
caused violence against other groups of people for religious, or indeed 
any other reason.
For example, the catholic church in the middle ages had a massive amount 
of power and used it to eliminate elements of society which threatened 
it`s position, it acted effectively as a government, which is, after all, 
merely a set of people who adhere to a rough set of beliefs and commonly 
held principals, the root of government is in religion, they are two 
sides of the same coin.

Racial and tribal hatred is a more convincing argument but is still 
rooted in religion, a lot of the violent overthrowings of governments 
around the world have resulted from that government taking a racist 
position, most anti-government protests and indeed even riots in the 
western world are caused by racism or opposition to it.

Class conflicts can be similarly dismissed as another facet of 
government, where the government favours one group of citizens over 
another in terms of the way in which it governs the anger of the 
repressed or badly treated group of people is often directed towards 
those in a better position than them rather than at the government which 
caused their position to become as bad as it did. This is merely the 
jealous nature of humans overcoming their logical side.

Beyond all of this, the argument isn`t really very interesting, I`m not 
interested whether the government murders and kills or not, any 
infringement of the rights of citizens is sufficient in my mind to make 
them criminal, and necessitate their removal from power, murder is merely 
an extreme form of this.

I saw nothing in the comment that suggested Jim believed he would bring 
about minarchist government, minarchism is a definite possibility within 
our current society, because it is based on the concept of democracy 
which is accepted by most participants in society and furthermore it has 
been proven to work in the past, the initial stages of the US government 
when the government adhered to the principles of the constitution could 
be called minarchist, you might say that the fact that the government has 
now increased in size and power suggests minarchism did not work, I would 
argue this was merely the fact that the governments power has, until 
recently, been increasing slowly, people take little notice of small 
infringements of their rights, the government know they can safely upset 
a few thousand people at a time without problems, then go on to offend 
the next few thousand once things have cooled down somewhat, at each 
stage of course the objection is small enough to be insignificant, the 
end result is the government can increase its power virtually without bounds.

Now most of the peons accept the "need" for larger and more powerful 
government the pace of change has accelerated, the government has begun 
to use force more and more often to crush opposition to its actions.
The terror state is on its way.

I would say part of each, they knew however that their position as 
government thugs protected them to a certain extent from retribution, 
has they been living in a minarchist society where their actions would 
have been punished harshly they may not have acted as they did.

This is not really an over simplification given my argument above, 
I believe most groupings in society can be reduced to some form of 
government or another, whether it is of your accepted narrow definition 
of government or in a wider sense.

Not a dream, a past reality, and indeed, in certain regions where 
government intervention is more extreme than it is in the USA or UK a 
present reality. The only reason for war is government, this is simple to 
see if one defines government as I have above. I do not believe this to 
be an overgeneralisation, merely a statement of fact, government is any 
form of custom or structure which forces certain courses of action on 
people. Of course there are exceptions, such as the NAP, which is a form 
of government under my analagy, which I do not believe could concievably 
be called an initiation of force because of its very limited scope.
