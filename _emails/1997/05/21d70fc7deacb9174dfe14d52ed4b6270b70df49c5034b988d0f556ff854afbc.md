No.  I personally have not.  People I know have, though -- the survey 
was completed about -- um -- a year and a half ago, I guess.  So it 
is somewhat out of date.

This is one reason I'm not so sure -- PGP Inc is not a defense contractor.

If you believe all your employees will correctly use the proper PGP
incantation each and every time, even when they are tired and haven't
had coffee for 4 hours, and their kid is sick, and their wife is mad
about something, then yes, it is simple.  But of course, that is not
realistic.  Employees are forgetful, the organizations goals are not
their goals, and the PGP UI is -- well, I find it a little awkward, 
at times.

So PGP's multiple recipient feature is a fundamental building block, 
but you need something more in a crypto-client to be sure that 
company policy is followed.  It's that "somthing more" that is the 
hard part.

And lest we get into the macho programmer argument -- of course it's 
just a mere matter of design and programming.

The company that bought the crypto software for the protection of 
company secrets.  I think I said "who *in* Acme Corp", though, as a 
prelude to the following points, because with the multiple recipient 
model there is a policy decision as to which key in Acme is the 
master.

Yes.  To make use of this flexibility you now need a piece of software
that allows you to produce policy decisions, sign them, and make them
visible to all the crypto clients.  Another mere matter of design and
programming.  And this bit of sortware needs to operate securely -- 
you can't just any joe blow subverting it.

You are right -- there is the degenerate case where the master key is
fixed.  However, I would contend that is *very* bad crypto design.  So
thus you have the problem of distributing information about a revoked
master key.  (Your solution, below, was that you have a signed policy
statement.  If you have a security breach, and are revoking a master
key, how do you know what signature to trust?)

Furthermore, by encrypting every document to the same master key you
have actually vastly increased your exposure -- a key-safe can have a
lot of special-purpose physical and cryptographic security, but the
master key in the multiple recipient model is almost certainly treated
the same as all other keys.  For example, in the key-safe model I can
just hand someone the master key on a floppy, and it doesn't do them
any good, because they can't get to the key-safe -- it is physically
secure.  Next I walk into the physically secure facility (I, as keeper
of the keys, have legitimate access), and change the master key.  No
security problem, no documents have been compromised, regardless of
their physical location or access.  With the multiple recipient model
if I hand out the master key, every visible encrypted document is
immediately and irrevocably compromised.  So the key-safe model 
allows you a far greater security for your data than the multiple 
recipient model.

Completely different environment, of course -- I saw some traffic 
where they admitted that probably without too much effort 
the policy could be subverted.  But I don't deny that it would be 
possible to build a policy distribution scheme -- but it is a 
non-trivial problem.

Nope.  Not at all.  The policy for multiple recipients needs to be
interpreted by the crypto clients.  But in the key-safe model policy
is almost entirely in human hands.  It doesn't even have to be written
down.  

Modestly secure example: The keysafe runs on a single workstation,
hardened similar to a firewall.  The only network connections are to a
single port, which does the cryptographically secure key storing
protocol.  When a key needs to be recovered, three trusted employees
troop into the room (three passwords are required, these passwords are
essentially the master key), and retrieve the needed key on a floppy. 
Other than the authentication protocol, there is *no* policy embedded
in the key-safe, which is to say, *any* policy the company wants to
use is ok.  It may take the personal presence of the company
president, it may take a signed statement from operations staff,
whatever.  No policy is embedded in software, and no software to
support software needs to be written.

Not so, as I hopefully explained above, the key-safe can have enhance 
security, so that the danger of a compromise is lessened.

I spoke too soon here.  The key-safe model is intrinsically more 
secure.

You may not be able to trust the signature.

Oh -- I'm sorry.  I didn't think through what you were saying.  You
were attempting to guard against an insider threat.  A waste of time,
probably.  He could frisbee a floppy out the window to his honey in
the red sports car.

How does the firewall know what is encrypted?  Just a bunch of gifs 
of the family?  Just the first 5000 lines of "Paradise Lost", slightly 
altered? 

Anyway, if the employee uses the "approved" MUA, and it isn't 
compromised, then it can store a copy of all outgoing mail, encrypted 
with the employee's key.  If he doesn't use the approved MUA, or the 
MUA is compromised, then of course the firewall protections are 
useless.  So, in the keysafe model, the firewall never enters the 
picture -- it is all handled in the MUA, anyway.

I agree with all this.  Only storage keys need to be in the keysafe.
