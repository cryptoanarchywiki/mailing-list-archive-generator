  Gee, and when Tim May said he was a felon, then I thought maybe
he was murdering children, or something.
  Actually, maybe Tim *is* murdering children, but the authorities
are leaving him alone because the numbers on his mailbox (written
in the blood of children) are 2" high, leading them to believe
that he is a model citizen.

  If Orwell had put a reference to a law such as this, with severe
penalities for illegal-sized mailbox numbers in his work, "1984",
he would have been laughed at as an unrealistic lunatic.
  (Not that he wasn't, anyway.)

  Around the world, conspiracy theorists and psycho-thriller
writers are starving to death because they can't compete with
reality and the nightly news.
  Me? I used to be an activist, now I'm just another guy/gal
taking violin lessons from Nero. (We meet Tuesdays at Motel 6.
Come on by, we'll leave a light-bulb joke on for you.)
