Dave,
  Around 20 years ago, I found out that the RCMP, during the course
of their evening shifts, regularly cruised motel parking lots, taking
down all of the license numbers and running checks on them.
  I found this out from first-hand experience, waiting to be booked
for the crime of having a name vaguely similar to someone they were
looking for.

  I have no doubt that many law enforcement agencies, including the
RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police for you non-frostbacks), have
made this kind of prying more efficient by enlisting the aide of
the motel management in their quest to follow every movement of
everyone, everywhere, at all times (except during donut-breaks).
