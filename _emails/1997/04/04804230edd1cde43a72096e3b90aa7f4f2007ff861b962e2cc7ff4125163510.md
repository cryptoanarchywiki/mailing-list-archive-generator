U.S.A. - "Silent" FinCEN Uses a Bullhorn.  After we published
several articles concerning the Department of the Treasury's
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in 1994, there
was talk of FinCEN "clamming up", in 1995 following the
appointment of Stanley E. Morris as the new director who
"doesn't talk in public".  Those rumors were poorly informed,
as Morris himself proved, in March 1996, with the publication
of his article, "From FinCEN's Director" which opened the first
issue of "FinCEN Advisory".  Seven issues of the "Advisory"
have now been published and cover questions such as the
Seychelles, fund-transfer record keeping, money laundering
typologies developed with the OECD/G-7 Financial Action Task
Force (FATF), the "Safe Harbor" provision, Mexico and other
questions.
