        Sorry.  Check out the cases that Soldier of Fortune magazine lost
for failing to check its classified ads.  The cases involved "gun for hire"
classifieds, someone got shot, and the estate was permitted to sue the
magazine.

        The tort analysis used a Hand test, in which the cost of screening
the classified (on its face an invitation to commit a deadly crime) was
found to be less than the cost to society of allowing the magazine to run
such ads.

        The facts of SOF are very special, but they show at least one
scenario where courts have found liability for running a classified ad.

        Regards,

        Peter
