www.myemail.net is a commercial remailer service;
you can get an account for $5/month for some services,
and use their web form free to send email and post news.
Some parts of it are still under construction.

Email has a nice attention-getting footer that gets put on each message
to indicate that it's anonymous mail (so if you want to chain
through other remailers, you'll need cutmarks), which says there's
no sender identity logging.  On the other hand, there's an interesting
pixel in the web form that you use to send the email:
	<img src="/stats/makelog.cgi" height=1 width=1>

Blocking is available both for email addresses and newsgroups.
For email, just fill in your address in a form; it's not verified
(my attempted mail to testme@bogus.com was rejected).
The blocking works immediately, and since you submit email via a 
web form, reject messages get presented directly rather than
being emailed to the bit bucket at some remailer.
For news, the policy is that newsgroups will be blocked if there are
requests from 12 different people (as distinguished somehow from
12 different requests by the same person forging headers.)

Encryption: If you connect to https://www.myemail.net/, the button
for anonymous email will fetch the form using https: ; if not, then not.
So you'll have to remember to use it correctly.  It's 128-bit RC4,
which may affect some non-US users who haven't gotten SafePassage yet.

It's a good start.
