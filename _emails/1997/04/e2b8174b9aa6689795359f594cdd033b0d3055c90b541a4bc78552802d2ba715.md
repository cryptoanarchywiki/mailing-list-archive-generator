I don't think power is the problem -- you could always include a 
small rechargable battery in the device, which would be plenty to fry 
an IC, given suitable support circuitry.  The real problem is the 
logic of the tamper detector itself.  How does it "detect 
tampering"?  You would want it to detect mechanical tampering, of 
course, but that's a non-trivial engineering proble.
