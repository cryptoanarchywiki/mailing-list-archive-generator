Well these are some of the straw-men that get pulled out whenever the
Government wishes to clamp down on the rights & freedoms of it's citizens.
Whenever you here the buzz-phrases: "save the children" this means "take
away more of your rights" & "terrorist" means "anyone opposed to the
policies of the current administration". -- Translations form the "George
Orwell NewSpeak Dictionary published 1984."

The overwhelming cases of child abuse including pediophilia are not done by
strangers but by members of the childs family or those close to the family;
freinds, daycare workers, neighbors, cleargy, ...ect. Those with close
contact to the child on a regular basis. Any regulation on the Internet
would do nothing to prevent this. It would be just as easy to lure a child
by using the Postal system but you don't see anyone demanding that all
letters be written on postcards to they can be read.

I can see no way of regulating such information. The basic information
required to make all kinds of nasty bombs & chemicals are taught in High
School chemistry classes. I guess we could ban all science and go back to
living in caves but that doen't see very practical now does it?
