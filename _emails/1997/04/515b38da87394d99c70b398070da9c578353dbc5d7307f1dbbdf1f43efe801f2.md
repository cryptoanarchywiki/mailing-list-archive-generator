  The disparity between various informational 'releases' of 
information surrounding the Wassenaar Agreement points to the
real intentions of those involved, which is to regulate the
availability to strong crypto not so much through legislation,
as through uncertainty surrounding legal issues which can result
in severe penalties to those who might chance to cross ill-defined
legal lines.
  In a previous post, I mentioned a law enforcement official who
responded to my question about one of the finer points of the law
with the reply, "I'm not paid to 'know' the law, I'm paid to
'enforce' it."
  i.e. No matter what action you perform, the interpretation that
the government uses to fuck you in the ass will take an opposite
position on the matter.

  I have seen back-to-back cases in the same courtroom, with the
same judge, where government prosecutors argued diametrically
opposed positions in order to convict the accused.
  The result? Two convictions.
