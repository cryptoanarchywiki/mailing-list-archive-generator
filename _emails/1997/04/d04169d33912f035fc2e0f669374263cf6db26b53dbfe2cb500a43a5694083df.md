Not my best prose, for sure.  But it is a reflection of sentiments I 
have seen expressed by people in business.

I'm not working from a cheat sheet.  No one is telling me what to say. 
Just like you, I am too totally inconsequential to make it worth
anyone's time to try to make me say anything. 

I am not in favor of GAK, either.  When I talk about companies wanting
key escrow I am speaking from observation, not ideology.  It's sad
that a mailing list that purports to be a bastion of free thought
harbors so many closed minds -- people who don't have the faintest
idea about my beliefs fall all over themselves jumping to conclusions,
apparently because they have become so conditioned to certain
buzzphrases that they no longer think.
