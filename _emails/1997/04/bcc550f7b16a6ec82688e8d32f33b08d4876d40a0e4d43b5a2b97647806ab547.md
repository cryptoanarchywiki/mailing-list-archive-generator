A very good reason to post anonymously, agreed.  There is a cost with
anonymity: people take you less seriously, none of your reputation is
on the line.  Anonmous persistent personas might be better as they
allow reputation to be tracked.  However persistent personas open
themselves to writing style analysis attacks.

I'm not sure this follows.

If a corporate can use it's wealth to influence other groups, for
example by assasinating key employees of opposition company, it may
well get richer as a result.  People do things for their own benefit,
and to the extent that their predictions are accurate, those who
participate will fare better than those who do not (modulo the chance
of reprisals, if it is apparent who is doing the attacking, and if the
attacked organisation survives to retaliate).

Yeah, but if the premises required for AP to exist at all are true
(government-proof anonymous payment system), and if it doesn't turn
out to be much fun, you'll have a job getting out of it.
