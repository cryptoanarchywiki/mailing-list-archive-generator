Now, how do we get all of these people to use PGP for their e-mail?

(Also interesting to note is the fact, that they'll use 128 bit
crypto, regardless of what the US gov thinks about it...:))

 In> Sweden Gets Wired With Netscape (04/03/97; 8:30 p.m. EST) By
 In> Douglas Hayward , TechWire

 In> STOCKHOLM -- Netscape is negotiating an innovative deal with
 In> the Swedish national postal service aimed at creating a
 In> national intranet covering the whole of Sweden.

 In> Sweden Post plans to use Netscape's Communicator browser and
 In> SuiteSpot server software to offer Swedish households and
 In> small businesses intranet and Internet access services,
 In> according to observers familiar with the proposed deal, which
 In> is worth more than $10 million.

 In> The postal service would use the Netscape Directory Services
 In> product to create a single "white pages" facility covering all
 In> Swedish households wishing to join the scheme, which would
 In> potentially create a national intranet, observers said.

 In> All households joining the network would be given by Sweden
 In> Post electronic mailboxes and a copy of Netscape's
 In> Communicator browser software. The postal service would manage
 In> households' electronic mail services in a manner similar to
 In> the way it manages paper-based mail services. Sweden's total
 In> population is about 8.8 million people.

 In> The email addresses issued by Sweden Post would mimick the
 In> real-life address of each participating household. The goal is
 In> to issue more than 1 million email addresses by this summer,
 In> said Sweden Post spokesman Jan Andersson.

 In> "As far as I know, this is the first time a PTT has offered
 In> this kind of service," Andersson said.

 In> For households without networked PCs, Sweden Post would
 In> translate the incoming email and send it as separate faxes or
 In> print out the messages and send them through the paper-based
 In> mail system, he said.

 In> In addition to email, services offered to users will include
 In> electronic shopping, Web access, Web publishing facilities,
 In> and the ability to set up secure electronic trading outlets.
 In> The service will use 128-bit encryption software and digital
 In> certificates to ensure security.

 In> The idea that each assigned email address would be similar to
 In> the recipient's street address is troubling, said Ian Walden,
 In> a specialist in IT law for the London-based law firm of Tarlo
 In> Lyons. The plan may even violate the European data protection
 In> directive, a 1995 law that is in effect in all 15 nations in
 In> the European Union, he said.

 In> "Is it necessary to make a direct link in the email address to
 In> the physical location? I think it's dangerous," Walden said,
 In> "and I would warn Sweden Post to reconsider such an approach."

 In> Netscape will supply Sweden Post with browser and server
 In> software for an initial fee of roughly $10 million under the
 In> proposed deal, which was agreed in principle early March but
 In> has yet to be finalized. Sweden Post already uses Netscape's
 In> electronic publishing and merchant software in its Web-based
 In> electronic shopping mall -- known as Torget -- under a deal
 In> signed last year.

 In> Sweden Post, which recently lost its monopoly of mail delivery
 In> services in parts of Sweden, wants to become a major player in
 In> the Internet services market in order to compensate for any
 In> decline in its traditional business as a result of the growth
 In> of electronic communications.

 In> "Sweden Post realizes that either it gets into the electronic
 In> services market in a big way, or it loses a lot of business to
 In> Internet service providers. And for Netscape, deals like this
 In> with utilities are a perfect way to overcome Microsoft's
 In> greater marketing power among ISPs," said the observer.
 In> "Netscape believes that if it can to sign up the utilities, it
 In> won't have to worry too much about the ISPs in Europe."

 In> The initial licensing fee would not include the cost of future
 In> software upgrades nor the cost of royalty fees for copies of
 In> browser software distributed to households by Sweden Post.
 In> Lennart Gren, Netscape's director for the Nordic region
 In> including Sweden, declined to confirm that the deal had been
 In> agreed.

 In> Netscape has been targeting utilities and telcos in Europe for
 In> some time. In February, the German national telco, Deutsche
 In> Telekom, said it would promote Communicator as its browser of
 In> choice. The telco added that it would use Netscape's intranet
 In> suite as its product of choice when building intranets for
 In> corporate customers.
