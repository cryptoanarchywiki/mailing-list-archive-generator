Excerpt from Vancouver Sun:

> <snip>
>  If Ottawa goes ahead with the proposal, Newfoundland would no longer
> have their own special time zone, which is 30 minutes ahead of the
> standard Atlantic Time Zone used by their neighbors to the West.
>
>  Newfoundlanders, however, are expected to raise a great outcry over
> loss of their historical half-hour time zone, regardless of Ottawa's
> concerns over what they consider excessive cost for the benefits
> gained by Newfoundland's citizens.
