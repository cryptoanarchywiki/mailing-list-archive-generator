_Corporations_ have to.  Unlike individuals or partnership businesses,
a corporation is a legal fiction chartered by the government,
and has to do what Big Daddy says or it'll be informed that
it no longer exists.  (The lawyers can point out that it's
obviously more complicated than that, but that's the basic idea.)
If they don't like it, they don't have to be a corporation.

Doesn't work that way.  Unless you can make a very strong case that
they're singling out _you_ because you're black/female/Republican/Jewish,
it's extremely difficult to say "you can't prosecute me because you
didn't prosecute _him_ first" - otherwise there'd be no way to 
prosecute the first person.

If you're not just trolling (:-), here's one piece of advice -
please don't go in with a case that's too weak, whether
it's because you're underfunded, have other problems affecting
the overall case results, don't realize how much abuse you'll be taking,
or look too much like a Waco for the average mundane jury,
because every case the Good Guys lose sets bad precedents.
