  i.e. - The War on Drugs was declared by a traitorous criminal
who was guilty of far greater crimes than inhaling the smoke of
a plant put on earth by God, for use by mankind.
  Nixon's position of power shielded him from being punished for
his crimes against the nation, unlike happy hippies who serve 
hard jail time for their 'sins'.

  Perhaps Jim Bell's 'War on Thugs' via AP is only a furtherance
of the "Assassination of Political Careers" instituted by Deep
Throat and the Washington Post.
