Toto hints at some issues here that I've been wondering about for a while 
now.  What are some effective strategies for securely introducing 
"newbies" to the world of cryptography and anon remailers?  I'm 
currently attending college, which means that my peers all use email very 
regularly -- a ripe environment for use of cryptography in email, I should 
think.  However, nearly everyone's email accounts are on a central Unix 
machine, which brings up many issues about the (lack of) security of 
private keys on multiuser machines.

My question is this -- is it better for the crypto community in the long 
run to have more people using encryption, but perhaps insecurely, or 
to have fewer users whose communications are more cryptographically secure?

Thus the time may have come to abandon the cool, measured language of
technical reports -- all that talk of "perturbations" and "surprises" and
"unanticipated events" -- and simply blurt out: "Holy shit!  Ten thousand
years!  That's incredible!"
