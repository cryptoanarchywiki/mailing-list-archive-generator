Screwy as the New Israel idea may seem, it's been
around a while.

There was talk of such a plan in the early 90s to settle 
Russian Jews in the US Southwest, using decommissioned 
military bases as new Ellis Islands, kibbutzim, trailer 
trashheaps. As was eventually done in the Israel (our 
firm surveyed housing sites for the latter and learned of
the alternative US plan then).

We were told that the promise of Amer-Indian casino gambling 
made southwest real estate too attractive to devalue with
refugee camps, so the idea was deferred it until the gambling
gold rush eased, or a Mid-East conflagration kicked in an
emergency relocation plan devised by DoD (no surprise 
there, DoD contingency-plans the globe).
