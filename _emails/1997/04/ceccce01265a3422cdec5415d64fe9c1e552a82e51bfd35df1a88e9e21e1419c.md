Are the people at C2Net really this clueless, or is this a joke?

Let me see if I follow the C2Net shill's logic:

USPS generates my public/private pair of keys.
USPS doesn't list the private keys as the data USPS plans to retain
Therefore I can assume that they won't retain it.

I guess this fits with everything else C2Net's been doing and saying.
