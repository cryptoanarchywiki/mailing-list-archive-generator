Well, not to pick nits, but it was the peace maker, and it's name is
appropriate. AFAIK, the Peace Maker was intended primarily for LEAs.
You go into a warlike situation, then shoot people until there's
peace. No logical holes there. However, the premise that a large nuke
will keep some 3rd world dictator from lobbing some Exocets at your
ships is, well, provably false.

What, me on topic? never!
