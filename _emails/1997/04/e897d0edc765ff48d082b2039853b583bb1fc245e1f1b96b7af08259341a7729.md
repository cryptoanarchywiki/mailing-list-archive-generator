  Bill seems to be one of the few people to realize that tips and
tricks for experienced programmers does nothing at all for the
common user, who has no way of discerning which of the programs
and sites that they access are indeed compensating for a system
which contains a plethora of basic faults.

  When facing a firing squad, there is little comfort in knowing
that only one or two of the rifles contain real bullets.
  Pardon me for suggesting that the average user will realize that
he need not volunteer to face the firing squad if he doesn't want
to. The 10,000 people who enter their credit card number at a
web page prompt won't be on the nightly news. The guy or gal whose
life was ruined when they did so, will be.
  Does anyone care to estimate what percentage of the 10,000 who
didn't get totally screwed will think twice before using their
credit card on the web again?
