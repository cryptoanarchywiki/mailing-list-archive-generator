Sure DC is a swamp and NYC is a cesspool, but it's their lakes 
of shit that keep hungry dogs from the outback coming to feed. 
To hack politics, spin lies, hawk IPOs and Wall Steal from 
W&O. Both burgs draw never ending packs to plot the peddling 
of useless news and armaments and laws and fortune cookies --
all the SOS for which most countries need only one capital hole but 
for which America needs two to handle demand.

In that vein, I bet Declan learns to love Manhattan via Time's 
irresistable harem and ungents. All journalists, especially those 
doing duty in DC and CA, aspire to the cessmost of presspools.

So, Time-speaking a Declan, I nym drop that Cylink's board dined 
this evening at the Harvard Club to admire Dr. Leo Guthart hiccuping
the joys of bedding and gorging Sodom's delights -- the cost to be 
written off thanks to DC/NY/CA/AR mutual scratch-fleas legally
sanctioned worldwide: the need and deed of two-back gov and biz.
