I spoke with Jim Bell last night at his home in Vancouver, WA,
and he confirmed the story.

He has not been arrested but his equipment has been
confiscated. No e-mail possible until he gets access to
other machinery.

He says he's surprised that it has taken so long for Sam
to respond.

He can be reached at 1-360-696-3911

Now this assumes that the person I spoke to is Jim Bell
and not the USG in AP clothing, and that the entire AP 
gambit is not a sting.
