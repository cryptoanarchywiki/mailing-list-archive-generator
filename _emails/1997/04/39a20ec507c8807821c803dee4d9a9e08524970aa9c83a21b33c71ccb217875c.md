Just so you know, Toto, .gov informs me it doesn't want there to be
the slightest possibility of anyone thinking I am speaking for it.  

And the part about Jim Bell being an NSA shill? I am not volunteering
to testify to anything, but your are the *second* person to say
something about it, so it *must* be true.  And the part about the 
statist agenda?  That must be true too, since you quoted it.
