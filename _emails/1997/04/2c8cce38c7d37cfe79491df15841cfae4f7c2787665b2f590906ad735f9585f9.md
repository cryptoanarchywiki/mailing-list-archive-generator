                  Now, here are the results from last week's question
                  which asked....

                  Should there be one international group that
                  governs and controls web content?

                  85% said no...

                  while 15% said yes.

Interesting that the "sheeple factor" was as high as 15%.  (Or was it 
higher? Did 20 cypherpunks submit "no" 100 times each?)

This poll was accurate within 100%, 19 times out of 20 ;-) , but it
will still serve as fodder for someone's News Breaking Story.  At
the very least they could have implemented a "have-you-voted-yet"
cookie to weed out the technologically impaired who might want to
vote twice.
