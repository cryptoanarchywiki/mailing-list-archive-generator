A group of the Texan forces just invaded the home of one of their
neighbors, taking the couple there as "Prisoners of War".
The man was injured by glass, and has been treated.
They apparently haven't gotten along for quite a while,
and a number of the neighbors were starting to get
worried about the Republicans.  The house they attacked is
a heavy-duty adobe home.  The radio said the Republicans have
been communicating with the outside world, and that the normal
practice in this case was to cut the phone wires; didn't say if
the Republicans had the sense to bring a cell-phone or CB with them
when they attacked, but you'd hope an Internet-savvy group would :-)

To add some Cypherpunks content, this is one application for which
the pre-paid phone-card cellphones are a big win; if you've got
an account-based system, it's much easier for the Government to
ask the phone company what the suspects' phone number is
and order them to shut it down.  But card-systems would have to be 
traced from phone calls (very hard) or picked up with scanners.

Some other parts of the Republic have denounced this action.  
Invading a government building would have been one thing, 
but attacking civilian non-combatants is distinctly against 
the rules of "civilized" warfare...
