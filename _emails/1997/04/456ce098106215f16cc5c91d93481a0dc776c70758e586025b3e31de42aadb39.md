>From MediaFilter:
In October 1992, two months after the Weaver surrender, Pete Peters, a 
Christian Identity minister in Colorado, called a meeting of some 175 
radical right leaders. Among those in attendance were Aryan Nations 
ambassador Louis Beam and his lawyer, Kirk Lyons of North Carolina.
   
Also in attendance was former Virginia legislator and Gun Owners of 
America leader Larry Pratt, who advocated "armed militia units" like
those 
in Central America. Beam presented a paper to the meeting called
"Leaderless
Resistance", which called for small autonomous cells united by ideology
but acting independently.

This became the model for the Militia movement_and perhaps for Timothy 
McVeigh and his co_conspirators.

  Perhaps the great outcrys of "Timothy who?" that came from many
parts of the militia were similar to the similar cries of "Jim who?"
after Jim Bell's troubles.

TruthWho?
