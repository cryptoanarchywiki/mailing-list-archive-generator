Right, but this is where a tool comes in that lets you post a
seemingly "on topic" post to hundreds of newsgroups with the "Drink
Kaka Kola, Elect John, etc." in the sig file.  This also makes it
harder for an article to be canceled, I imagine.  Or you can do it by 
hand.  I am sure that in a 40 hour week I could post seemingly 
"On-Topic" to many newsgroups.  Hell, I'm doing this on a minor scale 
right now.

Bob just needs to be *really* smart.  And if he has a good 
relaitionship with his small, local ISP, then he can proceed as 
normal.  Hell, I never get complaints anymore.

Yet, every time I post I advertise my company.

Boy, I would be pissed off if I was Bob.  This is definitely the scary 
end of the internet.  Most people will never even know about this rash of 
first amendment violations, that you are calling "forged cancels" and 
"plug pulling".

I am so glad I fell into these groups when I joined the net just 
about 20 months ago.  Funny thing is, it's right where I belong.  
I always speak my mind and have been known as a trouble maker in the 
workplace.

Well, it seems to me that this is where this conversation is leading. 
The technology you are talking about here, without talking about it,
is quite exciting to me.  I'll be reading.

Still looking for HP Vectra RS input,
