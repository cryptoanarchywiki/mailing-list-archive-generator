This seems misguided IMHO. The current trend is towards 64 bit
processors and the inefficiency of using only half of a 64 bit
processor
seems to me to be somewhat more serious than the hassle of having
to kludge up 64 bit operations on a 32 bit processor. The most likely 
platforms are 64 bit and 8 bit (embedded systems such as cellular).

Thats also a somewhat limited approach. The x86 familly is getting
long
in the tooth. Intel themselves have it scheduled for replacement in
1999.
The architecture is very much compromised by backwards compatibility 
with the CISC instruction set. A mixed bag of AXP, Pentium PRO and
commodity embedded processors popular in VLSI cell form such as 
Z-80, 6502 and 680x would be more reasonable.

Like design a new cypher in 6 months?

Hardware is likely to cover a wide range of uses. The number of gates
for
DES in an ultra fast, `unwound' implementation is many more than a
n
iterator using the same gates for each round.

Surely this just menas that the tweakers get credit?

I suspect the assumption made is that the time table will slip. My
concern is 
however that the starting gate closes too soon. 6 months is too little
time
to start something entirely new. But I would not be suprised if there
was
an extension. But unless people know in advance there will be one it 
means that they find out in six months time that they have six months
to sumbit and algorithm.

I've seen this type of delay a lot in the IETF standards arena. The
working
group starts by assuming it has too little time to do something new
then
spends far longer plugging up holes in a broken plan.
