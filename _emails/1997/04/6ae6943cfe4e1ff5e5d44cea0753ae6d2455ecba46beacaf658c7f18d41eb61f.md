On the date above TruthMonger (#7) stumbled about missed the point:

[SNIP THIS TRIPE]


>>>>
The stench in Cuba was so bad under the U.S. backed Batista regime
that Guerva and Castro were a breath of fresh air for the majority of 
Cuban people.
Despite years of harassment, invasion, and economic attack on Cuba
by the shameless 'free' countries <yuk,yuk> of the world, Castro is 
still a better option for the Cuban people than other options.

<<<<

Moreover, young #7, those older than you recall the _joy_
with which Castro, et al, were greeted by much of the US media
and a large segment of the seemingly informed public.
Only, I say only, when it became common knowledge that Castro
was backed by the commies did he become the villain.

Better the people suffer under bu$ine$$-supported Batista than
be ruled by a Red!

Believe it; I was there, whippersnapper!
