Hitler can serve as an excellent example of the outcomes
of the steps you advocate.

What banal nonsense is this?
"Awareness of reality is the first requirement 
for sanity."

The awareness of the Gulag, the Deathcamps,
Japanese internment, Joe McCarthy? 

These things are real! Not part of the
political science theory-jargon you spew!

These realities _happened_ and were all justified
by their particular sponsors.

Let's try this theory:

"Extremism in the defense of Liberty is no vice. And...
moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."
