the privacy of information gathered about consumers by telephone companies.
The recommendations cover Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI).
CPNI is the information that is gathered by phone companies in the process
of delivering services, such as numbers called, length of calls, and times
calls were made.  The FCC is currently conducting a rulemaking on CPNI
under the Telecommunications Act of 1996.

The law limits the use and disclosure of CPNI information:

    a telecommunications carrier that receives or obtains
    customer proprietary network information by virtue of its
    provision of a telecommunications service shall only use,
    disclose, or permit access to individually identifiable
    customer proprietary network information in its provision of
    (A) the telecommunications service from which such
    information is derived, or (B) services necessary to, or used
    in, the provision of such telecommunications service,
    including the publishing of directories.

NTIA recommended that phone companies provide a list of uses for the
information and provide consumers with an opportunity to opt-out of those
disclosures.  However, this appears to contradict the text of Section 702
of the Act, which requires that phone companies obtain prior written
consent before they can share the information and use the information for
marketing purposes.  Telephone companies have been pressing the FCC to
relax that requirement and to require customers to contact them before the
telcos stop selling the information.  Public interest groups such as
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility and NetAction are arguing
for more consumer protection.
