Folks participating in this event may want to ask Rep. White why he
supports the "harmful to minors" Net-censorship standard. (How can I tell
if material on my web page is "harmful" to some Bible Belt fundies? How
can I block kids from viewing my site? Same problems we have with the CDA
1.0.)

If he gives satisfactory answers, then -- and only then -- will he be a
"leader on Internet policy issues." After all, the best Internet policy is
to just leave it alone.
