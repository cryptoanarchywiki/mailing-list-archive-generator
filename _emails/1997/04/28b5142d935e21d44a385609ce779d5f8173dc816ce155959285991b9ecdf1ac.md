             have been inadvertantly(?) mutilated after the fact.

  Likewise, we wouldn't want your ramblings to go unchallenged, as you
might be presented as a representative of Cypherpunk/pro-crypto views.

  Maybe they deserved them.  Making politics more risky may have the
benificial effect of thinning out the ranks of politicians to truely
dedicated ones, instead of the fat parasitic beurocrats we have now.

  Given certain political views contrary to your own, the government
not only incites but commits murder daily, on a much greater scale.
Is it so wrong try to put an end to this by a little strategic
assassination?

  You're completely off the mark.  Have you read his essay at -
http://www.prairienet.org/bureau42/public/apfull.txt

  He cited government officials involved in Waco, Ruby Ridge, and the IRS
as examples.  But, he clearly stated that:
    
 "It would be impossible, for example, to set up some sort of
  "Assassination Politics Dictator," who decides who will live and who will
  die, because competition in the system will always rise to supply every
  demand, albeit at possibly a very high price.  And if you believe the maxim
  that "absolute power corrupts absolutely," you wouldn't want to accept any
  form of centralized control (even, perhaps, that of your own!), because any
  such control would eventually be corrupted.  Most rational people recognize
  this, and I do too.  I would not have invented a system where "Jim
  Bell" gets to make "all the decisions."  Quite the contrary, the system I've
  described absolutely prevents such centralization.  That, quite frankly, is
  the novelty and dare I say it, the beauty of this idea.  I believe that it
  simply cannot be hijacked by centralized political control.

  As I pointed out in the essay, if _I_ were running one of the organizations
  accepting those donations and offering those prizes, I would selectively
  list only those targets who I am genuinely satisfied are guilty of the
  violation of the "non-agression principle."  But as a practical matter,
  there is no way that I could stop a DIFFERENT organization from being set up
  and operating under DIFFERENT moral and ethical principles, especially if it operated
  anonymously, as I antipate the "Assassination Politics"-type  systems will
  be.   Thus, I'm forced to accept the reality that I can't dictate a
  "strongly limited" system that would "guarantee" no "unjustified" deaths:  I
  can merely control my little piece of the earth and not assist in the abuse
  of others."

  If this is so impossible, then why do you later claim that:
"I have plenty to worry about, Bells plan would lead to murder of
innocent people."?

  You do have a point, though.  The actual payment would be hard to
enforce.  This is just a technical difficulty that can be overcome with
dedicated effort.  The idea is sound in all other ways.

  Ever heard of "virtual corporations"?  They may exist without heed
to national borders.  The technical means also exist for complete
anonymity on the internet, so that even the location of servers
may be concealed (via. Onion Routers, and their ilk).  Besides,
all interaction with the corporation could be conducted through
email, for which a rather high degree of anonymity exists already.

  This is debatable, as much as you fasion yourself the arbiter of
what is possible.

  Assassination transactions against anyone can be carried out
anonymously right as we speak.  There are absolutely no safeguards 
against that.  However, AP is different.

  AP calls for a large pool of money donated in generally small ammounts 
by large numbers of individuals.  The incentive for killing officials 
who garner retribution from whole populations would be much greater 
than that of some random individual.

  H.L.Machen perceptively noted, "It is a common fallacy of our time 
that a moron run through a university and decorated with a PHD will 
thereby cease to be a moron."  So save your credentials for
the tabloids.

  Ah, I see that you are in agreement with some of the framers of our
great constitution in rejecting Direct Democracy, in favor of
one or another flavor of elitism (Representative Democracy, lets say).
Not that it's necessarily so bad, mind you, but at least you're showing
your true colors.

  The state has no rights.  It is not a living individual.  Only humans,
and arguably animals, have rights.

  You're right.  It is not the American Way of justice.  However,
that way is not itself above suspicion.  The reliability of witnesses
is suspect, even when they are sincere in trying to recall events.
The judges are not above corruption, especially as they are in positions
of power and power corrupts.  Finally, the jury is not without its
biases, even when its not also paid off, as can be seen from the
controversial results of well publicised cases involving Rodney King
and O.J.Simpson.

>Therefore an instigator is not acting upon actual
>infringement of rights, merely suspected infringment.

  This may or may not be true.  Some donations to AP organisations may
have no basis in fact whatsoever.  The public is verry malleable, I'll
grant you.  However, others, such as large scale repression, will
have very real basis in fact.  Imagine the will of the Black people
being harnessed through AP organizations during American Slavery.

>The state employees suspect Bell plots infringement of his rights. 
>Therefore under Bell's own theory they have the right to respond by 
>infringing his rights, without trial.

  Of course.  However, the state employees are few.  The subjects,
or "beneficiaries" of the state are many.

>AP does not contain a coherent normative ethical theory.

  Of course it does, I don't think you've read closely enough.  Perhaps
you should stick to Nuclear Physics and Electrical Engineering.
Scientists are notorious for not "getting" ethics, or completely
ignoring them in wanting to stick to "pure" science.

  Obviously, Paul is speaking of crime from Jim Bell's "ethical theory"
perspective.  Phil discounts the existence of that perspective, and 
answers from a "real world" perspective, completely missing Paul's point.

>You may not consider him ethically to be guitly of something wrong.

  The state is self-perpetuating.  Threats to the well being of members
of it are taken seriously, that's no surprise.  It would be surprising
for the subjects of this state to wake up and pre-emtively protect
themselves from the state.

  Ah, sanity.  The Crusades seemed sane to the Christians.
The Holocaust to the Nazis.  Communism to the Russians.  And now,
a police state to the Americans.

You're such a good patriot.

  More elitism!  Well, we're all lucky we have you, the agents at Waco and
Ruby Ridge, and the IRS to protect us.  Perhaps you'll do us all a favor
and judge yourself superfluous and even harmful to "the people's cause"
and put a contract on yourselves in an AP organization, when they come
to be.  I thought not.  All we'll see are attempts are self perpetuation.

  Again, what do you have to worry about if, as you say, "Bell's scheme 
is entirely preposterous"?
