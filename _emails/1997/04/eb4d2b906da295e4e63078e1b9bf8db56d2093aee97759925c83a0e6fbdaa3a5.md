Ah, but the likelihood is now greater that even more restrictive ratings
and censorship will be imposed. After all, when have you known statists to
back off simply because a policy doesn't work as promised?

I know I sound like a broken record, but these "attachments" are getting
out of hand. I periodically look at my attachments folder and find several
dozen or more various attached files...GIFs I'll never look at, Postscript
versions of postings to the list, binaries of programs for platforms I
can't possibly use, and even .WAV sound files. Arrgghhh!

(This GIF I opened...it appears to be a beer bottle with a star hanging
around the neck. Self-ratings of beer?)
