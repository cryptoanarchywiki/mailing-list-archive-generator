We still have North Korea, and even better, Myanmar where net access is
illegal.

What is highly amusing is the mounting evidence that alcoholic beverages in
moderation are good for your health.  Of course, if you are one of the

use alcoholic beverages.  But many people have bad reactions to various
foods.  That's no reason to forbid them or their advertising.
