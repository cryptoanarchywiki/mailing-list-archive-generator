	Well, Considering that A-10's can fly comfortably in "ground clutter",
or "trees" as civilians call them, it isn't suprising to me that they 
couldn't track the fucker, and it is my firm belief that if the pilot 
had wanted to dump his paylod over denver, coffin makers would be on overtime
right now.
