I can comment, and I am not a lawyer -- I in fact know of one such 
case, where one large organization signed a MoU with another one that 
agreed that PGP signatures would be valid authorization for work 
orders and selected other transactions.  This can be useful where the 
organizations in question have a long term relationship, and they are 
willing to go to the expense of drafting such a contract.

Suppose I offer to sell you my car for $1000.  We are not going to 
manually sign a contract to accept our pgp keys on a contract to sell 
the car, we will just do the total deal with manual signatures.  Title 
will be transferred at the Department of Motor Vehicles with manual 
signatures.  Smog certificates will be signed with manual signatures.
It isn't worth the time and trouble to set up any kind of a special 
arrangement for digital signature for one time or sporadic, low 
volume transactions.  Not until there is a legal infrastructure in 
place will we be able to do that.

Not a chance.

We're not talking about standards for a company, we are talking about 
standards between companies, and government agencies.

All kinds of reasons.  A Title Insurance company isn't going to be 
able to use digital signatures on Deeds of Trust without court 
approval, to just pick an example out of the air.

So what's the problem?  Your answer is the problem:  "You hire 
people...You have IS staff...You can automate etc"

This costs *money*.  There is no reason to use digital signature
unless it saves you *money*.  A business isn't going to invest in DS
infrastructure, especially of the scale you describe, just
because they think it's fun.

This is a terribly simplistic view of things.  Businesses also
make good use of the level playing field that is provided by laws.
