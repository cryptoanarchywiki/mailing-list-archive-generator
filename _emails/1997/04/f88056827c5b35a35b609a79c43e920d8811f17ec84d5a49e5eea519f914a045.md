Ron Rivest has just added a new paper on Micropayments to his Web site:

Electronic Lottery Tickets as Micropayments (rump session talk given at the
Financial Cryptography '97 conference)
http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/publications.html

Its in Postscript, perhaps when the HTML Math proposal finally appears...
(Three years and counting so far).
