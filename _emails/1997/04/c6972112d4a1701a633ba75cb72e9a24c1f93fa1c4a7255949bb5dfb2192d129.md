According to an article in the Swedish newspaper, Svenska Dagbladet
<http://www.svd.se/svd/ettan/ettan_97-04-11/narkotikapolisen.html>,
the Stockholm narcotics police has asked the national police and
State Prosecutor to require that purchasers of a new telephone
card used for mobile telephones be registered, and that the police
have access to the purchaser database. "Since the card is purchased
anonymously, the owner cannot be determined, which makes wiretapping
impossible." The new card is pre-paid with 250 or 550 kroner (very
roughly $32 or $70) air time and a telephone number, but does not
require any other subscription. The card can be used on an ordinary
GSM mobile telephone "which can be borrowed or stolen" and can be
re-loaded when the air time runs out.

A similar card is in use in France. However, the French security
service made the government force the telephone company to require
that purchasers show an id card when tbey purchase the card.
