Let them send pictures and warez. A remailer operator shoudn't care. :-)

Well... Let me quote the complaint that Jim Ray (himself a one-time
remailer operator) sent to postmaster@dm.com because he didn't like
the anonymous messages that he thought might be coming from me:

If the maintenance of destination blocking/unblocking is divorced from
the remailer operators, then the whistleblower might be able to find
out whether the recipient accepts anon e-mail. Under the scheme I sort
of proposed, if I wanted to e-mail X, I might look up via the key servers
whether X accepts anon e-mail. If he doesn't, I ping him, knowing that
my ping will be discarded and instead he'll get a form letter telling
him how to enable receipt. I can check (say) the key servers a few days
later and see if he's ready to recieve anon e-mail; then I send the
real message.

Another advantage: there's no need to put the remailer's real address
in the form line.  Right now most operators say something like
"e-mail foo@bar and/or remailer-operators to be dest-blocked".
Under the scheme I'm not quite proposing yet, you can put any
junk in the from: (it's irrelevant!) and put the instructions
for dest-blocking via a 3rd party in a comment header.
