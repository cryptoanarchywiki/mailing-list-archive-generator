  And Declan's articles genuinely interest 'me'.
  Having done a variety of 'reports' ranging from business reports to
press reports, I recognize that they have to be written so as to be
readable to those with no deep-rooted background in the events or
issues being reported.
  While those who faithfully follow the CypherPunks list and the
issued discussed here may find his reports somewhat shallow, I try
to read them from the perspective of those who have an interest in
the issues but only limited knowledge concerning them. From this
perspective, Declan's reports do a good deal to enlighten the masses
in regard to whatever issue he addresses.
