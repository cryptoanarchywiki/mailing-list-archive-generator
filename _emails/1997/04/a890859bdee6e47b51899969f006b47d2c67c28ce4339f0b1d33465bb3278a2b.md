   Key escrow amounts to both and more. In escrowing your keys, you are
doing so to the FBI, the CIA, the Department of Agriculture, Social
Services, the janitor at the Key Escrow holding facility, etc.

   Should we put our faith in the 'good intentions' claimed by those
promoting key escrow?
   Talk to the grandmothers whose cars were confiscated because their
dear grandson left a roach in the ashtray, under authority of the laws
that were supposed to thwart drug kingpins. 
   Key escrow is needed so that grandmothers of the future, plugging
the parking meters of strangers with eCa$h, cannot escape prosecution
by using encryption.

   In lean econonomical times, employees tend to get whatever they are
given...end of story.
   If the employees are to get something other than Big Brother type
of control over their work-lives, then it is up to those such as the
CypherPunks and others who value privacy to promote viable options
for corporations to choose from in the security area.

   If the only security options that a corporate manager has is no
control or total control, then there will be those who will be forced
by circumstances to opt for the latter, regardless of whether they
find it personally distasteful.
   Indeed, members of the Tim C. May Corporate Sabatoge Revolutionary
Committee may well find that they can sabatoge the government's evil
intentions without harming their employer's position, merely by
making an effort to ensure that their company's product gives the
undercover Human Rights agents that have infiltrated corporate
management an option to choose a product that they can customize
with a view toward maintaining both company security and employee
privacy.

  Let's face it, the government will roll over anyone who is unarmed,
and have Kent issue a press release suggesting that the citizens were
crying out for tank-tread marks on their backs.
  The solution is to provide as many workable products/solutions as
possible for those who feel a need for encryption, so that they may
customize their use of it according to their own inclinations and
level of conscience.
  The government always seems to have extra munitions on hand to
give to would-be dictators, it is up to disorganizations such as
the CypherPunks to make certain that the citizens have the 
opportunity to arm themselves, as well.
