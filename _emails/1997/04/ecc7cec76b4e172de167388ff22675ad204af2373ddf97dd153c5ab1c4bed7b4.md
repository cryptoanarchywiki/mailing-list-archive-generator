Another point, that most PGP-"uninitiated" (challenged? :)) people
fail to realize is the non-individual-based approach to e-mail
snooping. Commonly people think, that first they have to be
specifically targeted by a "bad guy".
But in the times of Echelon and generic key-word-based filtering of
_all_ e-mails, that go through certain points (Satellite-Links
etc.), nobody has to be specifically targeted anymore, because
_everybody's_ e-mail is potentially read.
All other things you mentioned are of course valid too besides that.
