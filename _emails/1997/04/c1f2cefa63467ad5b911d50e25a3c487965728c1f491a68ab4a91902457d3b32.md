Indeed. Let's try to get a copy of the draft mentioned in the affidavit:
" 20. Also included with the letter to Professor Fushimi was a draft
document written by plaintiff Payne entitled a "Public Key Encryption Is
Easily Broken." No member of Dr. Payne's management was advised of his plan
to release this document and Sandia had no opportunity to inform NSA of his
plans. "
