Wavefronts are a possibility. The disadvantage of any capacitor based
system is that capacitors discharge over time. If the system gets
disconnected from the power supply, before long the device has to be
activated or lose its effectiveness. "Use it or lose it".

This may not be ideal for the particular application.
