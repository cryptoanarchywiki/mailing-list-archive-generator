If people want to see the effect of an AP society have a look at Cuba.
Under the Batista regime $50 was sufficient to have someone killed.
There was anarchy, the police were corrupt, the mafia ran most of the
few parts of the country that worked - even they found the lack of order
a problem.

The result was Fidel Castro. The Batista regime could neither reform nor
survive. Any society that was threatened by AP would likewise collapse.

It is important to distinguish liberty and libertines. The libertine
recognises no check on individual rights, even when they affect the
rights of others. The inevitable result of libertinage is
authoritarianism.
