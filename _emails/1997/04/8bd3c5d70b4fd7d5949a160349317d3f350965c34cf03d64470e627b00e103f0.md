FRAUD AND THE NET

A Deloitte & Touche report commissioned by the European Union
says that cross-border fraud involving Internet abuse, banking
and investment frauds, and smuggling is costing society
$77 billion a year.  The report suggests that perhaps the
largest single threat comes from fraud through the Internet,
because encryption technology remains vulnerable to
sophisticated computer vandals.

Anyone have a pointer to the full report or a more detailed
abstract?
