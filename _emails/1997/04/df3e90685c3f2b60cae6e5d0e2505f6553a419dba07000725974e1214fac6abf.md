The TV show "Computer Chronicles" Saturday featured
various comm security products, one of which used a fax 
encoding system with unusual capabilities to transmit color
images, condensed text (say, a 30-page doc encoded
on a single fax page) or any other digital data as visual
clutter.

The hard copy is scanned at the receiving end and the 
program decodes and decompresses to the original format.

A demonstation showed that the clutter-code has error-correction 
robust enough to overcome any physical damage or defect in 
the transmittal or output.

We missed the name of the product and would appreciate
hearing from anyone who did, or who knows of the product.
