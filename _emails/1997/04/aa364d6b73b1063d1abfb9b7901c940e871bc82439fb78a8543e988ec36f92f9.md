I forwarded Mr. May's post to a buddy of mine, Ronald Carrier, who is 
getting his Piled Higher and Deeper in Continental Philosophy. I asked 
for comments, and recieved permission to forward his comments to the 
list. Here it is:

> (1) Nietzsche as "anti-systematic" thinker: this is something that is

> Nietzsche thinks that thinking was an activity that is ultimately in the

> develop a certain way of living.  Indeed, he regards systems primarily as 
> _symptoms_ of various ways of living.
> 
> What he dislikes about systems is that they are perspectives that are, so 
> to speak, monopolistic--they are ways of thinking (and, in the end, ways 
> of living) to which everyone must submit themselves and which deny that 
> there are other ways of thinking and living that may be better suited for 
> someone.  Nietzsche is anti-system in that he thinks that life is best 
> served if one is able to develop in oneself the capacity for multiple 
> perspectives, multiple ways of thinking and living.  Nietzsche himself 
> attempts to do this in his own writing--hence the aphoristic style of 
> which he was fond.  (This is not to say that Nietzsche was not capable of 
> developing a sustained argument--_On_the_Genealogy_of_Morals_ does

> 
> For Nietzsche, thinking best serves life and is symptomatic of life at 
> its best (i.e. a life that is active and deals creatively with the 
> circumstances that chance throws up for it, rather than one that is 
> reactive and tries to minimize the role of chance and change in living) 
> if it is the interplay of as many different perspectives as one can handle.
> 
> (2) Nietzsche and evolution: I think it's good that the author pointed 
> out the connections that can be made between Nietzsche and contemporary 
> evolutionary biology.  Nietzsche did not think much of Darwin, but this 
> is not so much because he disagreed with what Darwin wrote (I'm not sure 
> whether he had read Darwin himself or not) as because he disagreed with 
> what others tended to make of what Darwin wrote (or what they supposed he 
> wrote).  Nietzsche disagrees, not with Darwin's notion of natural 
> selection, but with the popular notion of evolution (a notion which 
> Darwin did not himself employ in his works).
> 
> "Evolution" presupposes that what organisms there are and what they are 
> like is something that is predetermined and that inexorably unfolds 
> across time.  Natural selection, even in Darwin, is incompatible with 
> evolution in this sense because natural selection posits chance and

> of being human that the "evolutionary" thinker thinks is best.  This is 
> for Nietzsche a reactive way of thinking.

> But while Nietzsche's way of thinking is compatible with contemporary

> life is more than just a matter of biology.  (Nietzsche was suspicious of 
> science because he thought that it too aspired to be a system in the 
> sense of a monopolistic perspective.  In other words, he disliked scientism.)
> 
> (3) Authoritarian v. libertarian: The author claims that these are 
> contradictory positions in Nietzsche.  I don't think they are.  They 
> would be contradictory if Nietzsche held that everybody was equally 
> capable of attaining to life at its best.  Nietzsche is _very_ clear in

> to live as well as they do precisely because a confinement to one 
> perspective suits them--expose them to the possibility that their
