>I am happy to belatedly announce the release of AEgis Shell 3.0 for PGP. The
>release version has actually been posted for the last several days but the
>order processing pieces have finally been put in place.
>
>You can get the shell from http://www.aegisrc.com/Products/Shell
>
>If you plan to order the shell on the commercial shareware license you AEgis
>POC for sales is Michelle Bass.
>
>I also want you to know that tech support will be a little slow for the next
>few weeks. I am moving to a new job in Redmond, WA and AEgis will no longer
>be my primary employer, my main paycheck will come from someone else. I will,
>however, continue to work for AEgis on the shell and will continue to support
>it as will others. Until my equipment catches up to me, it will be impossible
>for me to track down new glitches. I will be able to answer question about
>the standard problems users have.
>
>I'd like to remind you that there is a shell-users mailing list available
>where users can support each other. This may be your fastest support channel
>for the next week. You can join this list by sending a message to
>shell-users-request@aegisrc.com with the word subscribe in the body of the
>message. To send a message to the list, send it to shell-users@aegisrc.com.
>
>I will continue to monitor the shell-support@aegisrc.com address. You can
>reach me directly at my alumni organization address of mlyman@west-point.org.
>My mlyman@aegisrc.com address will be forwarded to that address for a few
>months.
