Wow, a perfect straight line.  I couldn't ask for better.

Actually, I posted to sci.crypt.research a while ago about how to adapt
Rivest and Shamir's PayWord scheme to do anonymous micropayments; see
	http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/my-posts/anon-micropayments

In short, instead of asking the bank for a hash stick and a signature on
the top of the stick, you get a blind signature on a top of a stick you've
generated yourself.  Then you patch up some issues (like double-spending)
that the anonymity raises.

Sadly, it's got a problem that'd probably be a killer for practical
deployment -- it's got the same patent problems that ecash has.  Sigh.
