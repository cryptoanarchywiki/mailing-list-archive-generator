CTP is an acronym for Composite Theoretical Performance, 
a definition of computer capability used in the Export 
Administration Regulations. See EAR Section 740.7 
Computers (CTP) at:

   http://jya.com/740.htm

The US Department of Defense, Office of the Under Secretary 
of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, is the author of 
the Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL). See 
attribution at:

   http://jya.com/mctl08.htm

This should not be contrued to mean that I'm not also ignorant
of what I quote and quack about weird lists of holy-shit technology.
