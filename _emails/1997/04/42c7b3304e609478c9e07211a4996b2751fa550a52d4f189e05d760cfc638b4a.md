Last Page: Flying cow sinks japanese fishing boat

Wladiwostok. A cow fell out of an airplane before the siberian coast
and smashed onto japanese fishing boat, causing it to sink. That
reported the German Embassy in Moscow in an internal note to the
[german] State Department.

Appearantly a russian military plane was flying over the Ochotskian
sea with stolen cows on board; the cows started panicking and made
the airplane instable in it's flight - they weren't tied to the
walls. Therefore the pilots used the last possibility: they opened
the back door and moved the cows out of the machine. One of the cows
hit a japanese fishing boat and turned it over. The crew could save
themselves to the coast, where they were arrested by russian guards,
who wouldn't believe the cow story - until an investigation proved
it valid.

A russian official responsible for traffic is supposed to have
mentioned this case to the German Embassy as a strange example for
the terrible condition of russian flight safety. The State
Department would neither confirm nor deny the incident.
