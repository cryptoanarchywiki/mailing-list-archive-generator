You should definitely get a newer version of Windows (or Linux) and a
newer version of Netscape, together with a few clues.

Do a 'view source' in your ancient netscape, and you'll probably see that
the submit button lives in a form whose action="http://xxx.bbb.com/some.cgi".

Is it "his" form? On a big site, the domain contact is likely to have no
clue about _all_ the web pages on their site.
