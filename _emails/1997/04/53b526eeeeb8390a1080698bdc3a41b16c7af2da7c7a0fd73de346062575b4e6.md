A few years ago, I maintained a low-traffic mailing list in
which the users could be anonymous to each other - I was the
only person who knew the recipient list. I used perl scripts to
manage it, and manually edited messages which requested 
anonymity (it was a digest-style list). A perl script
individually mailed copies to about 600 recipients.

It worked, but was not scalable to higher traffic volumes.
