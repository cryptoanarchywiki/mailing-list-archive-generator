If Mr. Jack-Boots And Friends are standing behind you, it's too late
anyways.  You certainly won't have time to dig out the thermite /
magnesium, place it on the appropriate chip, and ignite it.  If you're
going to the trouble of rigging up an emergency destructo-circuit, you
might as well make sure you have something that fries the chip / PCMCIA
card completely.
