  Hallam-Baker is apparently incapable of understanding his own
trail of logic.
  He tells us that freedom of speech is not the issue, and then
proceeds to tell us that Jim Bell was dealt with differently than
others for exercising his freedom of speech.
 
  Now perhaps he can explain to us how race issues are not involved
when cops beat the living crap out of niggers when arresting them
for traffic violations.
  ("Until the nigger in intensive care 'gets charged with something'
I don't see that race is an issue.")
