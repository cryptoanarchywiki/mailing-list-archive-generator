  A Web page named "InterNet Free Terra" can be accessed at the URL:
http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/carljohn/

  It has been set up in order to provide URL pointers to Mirrors of
Web sites which have been subjected to censorship by governmental
authorities.

  Its first category is "InterNet Free Europe" and the first entry
is a list of Mirror sites for the Radikal Web site.

  Anyone who wishes to have Mirror site pointers added for other 
government censored Web sites may send mailto:carljohn@sk.sympatico.ca 

  Those submitting Mirror site pointers may want to include 
pointers to information and/or press releases regarding the
date and details of the censorship action, as there are plans
to include access to these details, as well as to the pointers
themselves.
