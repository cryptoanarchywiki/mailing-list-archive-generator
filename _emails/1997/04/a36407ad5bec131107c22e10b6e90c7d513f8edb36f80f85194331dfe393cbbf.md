Declan, would you please post this to fight-censorship with an invitation to
repost freely.

Cato and Brookings have a really interesting conference lined up for April
17/18 in DC.  I'm particularly looking forward to seeing Bob Corn-Revere
debating former Judge Bork on content controls.  We've decided to waive the
registration fee for students, professors, teachers, policymakers, and those
in the public interest community.  Feel free to join us--email Julie to rsvp
at jbriggs@cato.org or call (202) 789-5296.

REGISTRATION FEE HAS BEEN WAIVED FOR NONPROFITS, EDUCATORS, STUDENTS, AND
POLICYMAKERS!!!
