Right - if you're following up in a newsgroup, you can just re-use
the subject. You can also use the "From:" and other headers from
one of the regular posters.

If you're following up, then rather than being random, you can tailor
you response based on the message you're following up on - kind of
like Eliza or better. :-)

I don't think it's possible.
