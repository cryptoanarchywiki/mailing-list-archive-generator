Mr. WinSock Remailer shot holes in Tim May's highly 
questionable claim--
 "I support anonymous remailers for various purposes, but debate
is rarely enhanced in such cases."
--by producing an insightful post which actually quotes 
Jim Bell's own words, instead of blathering on endlessly
about his or her own skewed interpretation of Bell's AP
system, by writing:

  So, please, let the potheads on the list (the silent majority) 
refrain from dismissing Bell's ideas due to his alleged use of 
the 'wrong' illegal drug.
  And let the drunkards (Toto) and former drunkards (you know who
you are) refrain from embarrasing themselves by supporting every 
lunatic who has also destroyed the better part of their brain
cells.
  I, on the other hand, am a licensed physician, and my use of
narcotics is for legal medicinal purposes only.
