Sorry.  It's Edgar Peters, "Chaos and Order in the Capital Markets", 
John Wiley, 1991.  I'm sure you will rush out and buy a copy :-)

Clearly, you don't know what you are talking about.  Strictly 
speaking, chaotic behavior (as mathematically defined in chaos theory) is 
completely *deterministic*, not random.  The conundrum is that 
chaotic behavior *looks* random, and indeed, it can be very hard to tell 
if a set of data is generated by a determinstic chaotic procedure or a 
stochastic procedure.

Pretty pictures of Mandelbrot and Julia sets are generated by selecting 
points *determinstically*, iterating through a *determinsitic* algorithm, 
and looking at the result.  It's the mathematics that creates the 
complexity, not randomness.

(To be fair, of course, I must also state that some fractals are 
generated by starting with random numbers and running them through 
some algorithm.)

No, you described it just above when you said "just because a random 
variable is predictable within certain parameters".  So, for example, 
I know that if a head is worth $1 and a tail is worth -$1, my net 
worth won't jump by $100 on a single toss.

I don't know whether you are expressing your flatulent ignorance of
chaos theory, or whether you are referring to the term "trading
strategy".  I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume the
latter, and agree that the term "trading strategy" is at least 
suspicious.

A lot of those, for sure.  But Mandelbrot did some of his first work
on chaos studying cotton prices with Hendrik Houthakker, a Harvard
economist.  But how about Edward Lorenz (of the "Lorenz attractor")
studying weather, studies of turbulence, Feigenbaum & Co at Los
Alamos, the Dynamical Systems Group at Santa Cruz, etc etc.  The 
pretty pictures are pretty, but even I can do those.

Sure, that too.

I wasn't referring to simulating markets; I was referring to studying 
real markets.

No, just a joke.  Boy, I must really have hit a nerve.  Sensitive big 
ego, perhaps?

That's ok.  I just attribute it to a fragile ego, anyway.

It's understandable that you might make this mistake, given your 
misunderstanding of dynamic systems.

That nerve must really be throbbing.  Sorry.

You don't like my example, but agree to my point.  I like that.  So 
now we both agree that "there are actual exceptions to the efficient 
market hypothesis"  (your words).

You, unfortunately, misunderstand your own example.  It actually is a 
paradox.

Plenty of hot air around, as you speak.

No, I wouldn't bet that.  Even a lame theory a looks good against a
braindead strawman.

Actually the most entertaining thing is watching blowhards at work. 
And one thing for sure, Bob -- for all your failings, you *do* know how
to blow.
