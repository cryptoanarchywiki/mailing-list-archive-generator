|   	 ATLANTA, April 9 (Reuter) - The new security protocol for

|   	 Steve Mott, senior vice president of electronic commerce
|   and new ventures for MasterCard International, said it could
|   take hackers as little as a year to break the industry's
|   standard encryption code, which is supposed to render

	The security problem with SET is not its crypto, but its
complexity, which makes it impossible to determine if the thing is
secure or not.  Its also a nightmare to implement, and was supposed to
be ready six months ago.
