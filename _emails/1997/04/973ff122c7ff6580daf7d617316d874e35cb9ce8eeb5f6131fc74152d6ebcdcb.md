  Or it could be that those who are setting up AP systems
are not leaving themselves open to attack.

  Maybe that is because it doesn't address issues that the
government feel are enough of a threat to suppress.

  Perhaps if you weren't so liberal in your use of killfiles,
then you wouldn't be so out of touch with what cypherpunks
list members discuss on the list.

  Tim, lacking the ability to read, asks about those who
"advocate" AP.
  Adam is quite correct in his perception of cypherpunks
pussyfooting around their true views on AP since the
government attack on Jim Bell's views.
  Of course, Tim May attacks those who choose to remain
anonymous via the cypherpunks remailers.
  Tim and the IRS make quite a tag-team in denigrating
those who would speak freely about AP.

>(Actually, I recall very few supporters of AP, even before the list

  Since you shitcan the posts of a variety of list
subscribers, your recollections don't count for very
much, do they?

>I like a lot of your stuff, Adam, but on this one I think you're 175

  Perhaps Adam's view of reality encompasses a broader
range of posts to the list than Tim's does.
  Perhaps those who put all cypherpunks in their killfiles
could claim that the cypherpunks don't really exist.
