Why does Ray Arachelian wear jeans with cuffs?

To catch the falling dandruff.


Did you hear that after Earthweb, LLP, sacked Ray Arachelian for
spamming the 'net, he got another job at a ski resort?

His only duty is to walk along the ski trails and shed dandruff.



The 10 greatest inventions attributed to Armenians:

The solar-powered flashlight.

The pencil with erasers on both ends.

The vodka bottle with a magnifying bottom for watching television.

The parachute that opens on impact.

The artificial dandruff for wig wearers.

The waterproof tea bag.

The reusable non-stick toilet paper.

Traffic light with a candle inside.

The padlock key escrow.

Wheelchair with pedals.
