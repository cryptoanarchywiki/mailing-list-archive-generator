A Moot-Court dry run of the upcoming CDT hearing by the Supremes was held
Thursday in San Francisco and carried today by C-SPAN2.  

None other than our own M. J. Froomkin was one of the mock berobed ones.
His vigorous pro-CDT probing of the ACLU anti-CDT guys was probably good
practice for them, but he sure gave me the impression he really believed
what he was saying.

... Who has resolved to hold his nose and renew his ACLU membership.
