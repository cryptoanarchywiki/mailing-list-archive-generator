I would guess that this means that Netscape and Explorer send the complete
URL of the page that linked to another site in the "HTTP-REFERER" header in
the clear when SSL is used.  The only temporary solution is to use a local web
proxy that removes this header, or, as the article suggests, manually type in
an URL that is linked from a page using SSL.  I can't think of too many
situations where one might follow a link to another site immediately after
sending sensitive information, but the contents of the "HTTP-REFERER" header
are often logged, and the log is often world-readable...
