There does appear to be a coordinated global action to issue 
policies on TTP, GAK and the like at this time. OECD is due to 
shortly release its crypto policy, as is the USG according to BXA.
The FBI issued its wiretap payment plan yesterday. Herson
publically admitted the EU-FBI wiretap pact.

All are apparently guided by The Wassenaar Arrangement amongst
two dozen or so countries to act in concert, and to go public with
dual-use controls in unison.

So, Clint Brooks' comment at CFP about a new policy coming out
for stronger crypto is a surely a harbinger of global GAK, in the
guise of TTP or Key Recovery, as was speculated here, and as
Rensch's statement to the House yesterday affirms.

It's a policy sure to appeal to nationalists and chauvinists: strong 
protection for a nation's interest and commerce with GAK; without
it no protection from predatory (rogue) nations (and criminals). 

But, as the Crypto AG engineer asked, "Who will protect us from NSA?"
And its predatory clients and contractors, the Germans and French and
others are asking, now that they are suffering the unilateral spying
of their highest tech "friends."
