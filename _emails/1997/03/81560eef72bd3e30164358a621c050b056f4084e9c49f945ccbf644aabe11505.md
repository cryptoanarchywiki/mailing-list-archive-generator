While it is true that MITI has halted all exports of crypto products since
late September, citing their obligations under the Wassenaar "arrangement",
numerous high level meetings conducted by Japanese industry heavyweights
with MITI produced neither a copy of the arrangement nor any written MITI
guidelines. MITI reserves the right to decided on a case by case basis. So
far, every single export application has been denied.
