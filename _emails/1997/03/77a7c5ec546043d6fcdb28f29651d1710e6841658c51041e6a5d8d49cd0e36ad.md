  I wouldn't be so certain about that. Give the CypherPunks history of
treating PGP as a Holy Icon, I think a good case could be made for 
building a religion around key signatures.

  Apparently, however, not all CypherPunks can be considered 'True
Believers'. I, among others, checked out the information in the 
anonymous post which indicated press reports of the RSA algorithm
being broken.
  I suppose that now I will be denied the opportunity to partake of the
PGP Sacrament at the next CypherMass.
