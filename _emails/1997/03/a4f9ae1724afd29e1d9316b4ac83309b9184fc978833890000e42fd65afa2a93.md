Dunno about Akransas (that's where Uark.edu is, ain't it). Your
state is the home state of the muerderer Bill KKKlinton. You should
commit suicide at once.

But in the more civilized states, like New York or California, if
you have an accident and your (good) car is totalled, then one of
these three things will happen:

* The other driver, who's at fault, has fled. You sue your own insurance
company.

* The other driver has minimal insurance and no assets. You sue your
own insurance company (and the other guy).

* You don't carry the appropriate insurance with your own insurance
company and have no chance to recover much.

Things would be much easier for everyone, including the drivers and
the insueres, if the mandatory liability insurance was abolished
and evryone delt with their own insurer - who would then try to
recover damages from the other party if they had assets. The only
people who benefits from the existing system are state bureaucrats.
