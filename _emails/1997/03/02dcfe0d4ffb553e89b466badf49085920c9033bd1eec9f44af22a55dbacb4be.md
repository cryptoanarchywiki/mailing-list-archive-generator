Wouldn't just using an anonymous remailer work better? Encrypting a message
to your public key and then mailing it will not preserve sender anonymity.

Doing both would maybe be better, but for casual journalistic
whistleblowing, the remailers are more important than encrypting to the
recipient (unless Declan fears interception at _his_ site).

(P.S. Does this mean the San Diego Cypherpunks meetings will be more
lightly attended?)


Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
