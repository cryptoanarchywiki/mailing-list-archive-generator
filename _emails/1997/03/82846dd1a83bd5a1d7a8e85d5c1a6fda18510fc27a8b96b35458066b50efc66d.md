SecureFile is not using the Win 95 password for encrypting the files.
Win 95 or Win NT never hands over the password to any application.

CAPI 2.0 is so nicely integrated with the OS that unless you have logged
in you wont get access to you keys. Now SecureFile is CAPI 2.0 based
application, so to use SecureFile you have to log in. Once this is done
the crypto operations (encryption/signing) etc are performed using your
keys.

The advantage you gain is that, a separate SecureFile logon is not
required and nobody but you will be able to access your keys as they are
protected by the OS.

The SecureFile setup ensures that on Win 95 you have actually logged in
and that you are working in the "Multiple Profiles" mode.

Thank you for your interest in SecureFile. Please feel free to ask any
questions you may have.
