  That sounds much better than "Let's sit on our asses and see if the
for-pay remailers fare, _if_ they ever appear, while the attacks 
continue knock off more remailers."

was because of those who actively made plans for its continuance,
instead of sitting on their asses.
  Are you and Greg working as a team, here?
