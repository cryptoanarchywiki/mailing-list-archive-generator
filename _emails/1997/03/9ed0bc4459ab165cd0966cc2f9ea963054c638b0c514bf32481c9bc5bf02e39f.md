the responses i've gotten have been all too theoretical and, i believe, too
hypothetical and removed for most people. when asked if they value their
privacy, the public overwhelmingly agrees. when asked what their privacy
means to them, i don't think they have a solid answer. i get the sense that
most people don't see the hazards of corporations analyzing their buying
patterns, voter registration records and medical records. i don't think it
has come home to most people. 

i don't disagree with the people on the list. i am just having a hard time
translating it to the public in concrete terms.
