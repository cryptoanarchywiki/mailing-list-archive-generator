The "Report of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing
Government Secrecy," boosted in the NY Times today is 
available in PDF format at:

It criticizes government's unwarranted use of secrecy as a means of control.

The main report is 155 pages long with appendices of 120 pages, including
a history of the abuse of secrecy in the NatSec era. It also has a section on 
"Information Insecurity" which addresses impending moves by the gov to
deal with threats to the Racketeer-Influenced "if you knew what we 
know" Criminal Org.
