Subject: [NTSEC] CIFS Authentication Protocol Errata

Sharp eyed reviewers have already caught the following errors in
CIFS-Auth (CIFS Authentication Protocol), draft 3.
A new version will be forthcoming shortly.

In paragraph 2 of section 1.1, it should say:
The response is computed by DES encrypting a challenge (a nonce)
selected by the server with three keys derived from the user's password.

In section 1.2,
	[s]<n:m>	be the "n" bytes of s starting at byte "m".
should be clarified to be:
	[s]<n:m>	be the "n" bytes of s starting at byte "m" (the
first byte is numbered 0).

In step 1 of section 1.4,
was:
	Kb = [Ks]<7:8>
	Kc = [Ks]<15:2>, Z(5)
should be:
	Kb = [Ks]<7:7>
	Kc = [Ks]<14:2>, Z(5)

In step 4 of section 1.4
was:
	Kb' = [Ks']<7:8>
	Kc' = [Ks']<14:2>, Z(5)
should be:
	Kb' = [Ks']<7:7>
	Kc' = [Ks']<14:2>, Z(5)
and
	Km' = Ks, R
should be
	Km' = Ks', R

In step 6 of section 1.4,
C:	MS' = [MD5(Km, SN, Msessr, CC, CS)]<8>
should be
C:	MS' = [MD5(Km, SN, Msessr,)]<8>

In step 2 of section 1.5, there is a missing right bracket:
	S->C:	Mrsp, [MD5(Km', SN', Mrsp)<8>
should be:
	S->C:	Mrsp, [MD5(Km', SN', Mrsp)]<8>
