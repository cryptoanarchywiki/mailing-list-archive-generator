I once, as a prank, sent mail to cypherpunks-outgoing-ksiuw@toad.com.
Since cypherpunks-outgoing-ksiuw is a simple sendmail alias, all bounces
went directly to me as my name was listed in the "From " field.

I got about a hundred or so bounces, some of which were results of
intermittent problems like full mailboxes, etc. (the actual number could
be 90% likely between 50 and 150 as I was not really counting).
