Personally I believe, that the fundamental problem with remailers
is, that there are simply too few of them. If there were a few
hundred or even thousand around the world, it would be much harder
to crack down on the R-network and the individuals, who run the
remailers.

In need is a remailer program, that even not so technical people
could easily run from their common Windoze machine. Jgrasty's
winsock remailer is a good step in the right direction (although it
didn't work for me personally).
