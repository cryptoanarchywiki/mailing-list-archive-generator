]Cypherpunks is currently an unmoderated distributed list. You can send the
]command 'subscribe cypherpunks' to one of several sites:
] majordomo@algebra.com
] majordomo@ssz.com
] majordomo@cyberpass.com
]
]You can send submissions to cypherpunks@ any of these sites.
]
]If someone (Dale?) has saved the output from several 'who's over the last
]few months, it might be a good idea to e-mail them once and to tell them
]this. Apparently the new subscription instructions never made it to those
]who remained only on the moderated list.
