Something different.  There are several products that are designed to
improve the strength of the encryption securing the connection between
the browser and server.  Here are a couple of URLs with more info:

    http://www.c2.net/products/spwp/
    http://www.medcom.se/ssr/

I believe there are a couple of other competitors as well, but don't 
know the URLs.
