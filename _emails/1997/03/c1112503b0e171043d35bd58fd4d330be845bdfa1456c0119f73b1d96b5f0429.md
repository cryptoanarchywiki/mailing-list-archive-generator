Indeed, in most cultures beating the shit out of one's children 9and women)
every day is the norm.  "Spare the rod, spoil the child." Western Civ is a
rare exception.

Indeed, in most cultures until recently most people were never taught to read
unless they intended to become priests.

5) castrating one's male children if they show any propensity to sing -
in hopes that they'll become one of the few famous and successful male

What market force or natural selection discourages "abuse"?
