Note that remailer users should admit the possibility of a government
agent being among remailer operators. I have very high regards to John
Perry personally, but believe me, it does not a lot of effort to 
subvert a more regular person. It is generally easy to find some
"crime" that normally would not be prosecuted and and then bullied
into submission.

A reasonably risk-averse remailer users should accept that probability 
and never assume that one or two remailers in a chain is enough for
anything serious. As well, I strongly object to remailer operators
openly discussing who sent what to whom (as it recently happened).

If a remailer operator discovers that a certain user is spamming his
service, he could publish a hash (not cryptographically strong) of the
offender's email address and not teh address itself.
