DNS maps can easily be forged.  Key servers run on machines with questionable 
physical and operating system security.  Finally, key server ops themselves
can mess with keys.

This is why people who use keys off of keyservers are encouraged to verify
the key via it's key fingerprint, or at via the web of trust.

However, this can not be done via automation on a large scale for the purpose
of address blocking, unless via a certification authority.

The bottom line is that keyservers can not be trusted, despite any primitive
security measures they supposedly have in place.
