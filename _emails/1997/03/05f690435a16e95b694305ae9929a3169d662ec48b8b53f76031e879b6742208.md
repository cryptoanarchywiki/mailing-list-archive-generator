Which is somewhat illogical, because if we assume that things are legal 
until made illegal, and there is no illegal cryptosystem, that means that no 
bill can "make the use of any cryptosystem legal."

(I understand, of course, that you may simply be saying that the bill 
pretends to do it...)


>Prohibits the implementation of mandatory key escrow

Again, somewhat of a non-issue, wouldn't you say?  What with the 1st 
amendment, the government would have an enormous uphill battle to make key 
escrow mandatory anyway.

Key escrow agents (to the extent they currently exist and will exist in the 
future) are presumably entitled to contract with their customers whatever 
conditions and terms their customers desire.  If that DOESN'T include 
sharing the key with the government, as far as I know that's entirely 
legitimate.  ("impairment of contracts.") Also, I see no reason to believe 
that those agents will necessarily have copies of the keys in unencrypted 
form, useable by the government.  


>Criminalizes the willful use of encryption to obstruct justice

Which, as Tim May points out, could imply practically any useage of crypto 
with the "appropriate" misinterpretation on the part of government, 
particularly encrypted remailers.  Just what the Leahy bill last year 
appeared to be intended to do.


>Confirms that it is legal to sell any cryptosystem within the US 

Again, that's unnecessary and redundant.

What we should be particularly suspicious of is any differnces between last 
year's bill and this year's.  Somehow I doubt we'll see any desireable 
change; all the changes will be bad.
