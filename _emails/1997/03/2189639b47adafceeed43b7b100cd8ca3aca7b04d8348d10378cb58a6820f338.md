Well, I suppose it's possible that he didn't know about the politics of 
the university till he actually got there ... but highly unlikely, 
because it is quite notorious. And he did stay there.

Asphalt for roads, as I recall.

before sending it to the magazine.

emphasized it more than his competition.

I do tend to be a little bit suspicious of any state-owned broadcasting 
system (including PBS).

But this is way off topic for cypherpunks. Maybe we should continue in 
email if we need to continue.

I do appreciate your perspective.
