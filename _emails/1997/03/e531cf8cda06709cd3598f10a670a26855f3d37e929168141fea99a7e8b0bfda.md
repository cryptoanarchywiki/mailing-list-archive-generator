I heard a story one time.  It evolved around a college student in
France doing some cyptography work in school,  working nights 
as a backup operator at some large computer center.  He didn't need
a cray.   A little knowledge and some creative programming,  and 
a center full of computers (problably around the size of a Sparc 10).
The story ended explaning how one of the encryption schemes that 
would tale a Cray week to break,  was broken in one night,  by a 
bunch of computers running backups.

It might be hard to find a cray,  but I know a guy,  he works 
at this place where they got them 15 pentium pros.  The average
network server has another server for some other task on the
same wire.
