Out of curiosity, do you know how the keys are protected by windoze
itself?
I have the CAPI cd but have had all of 5 minutes to look at it.  I would 
presume they're hashing your password into a key and then encrypting
with 
it, or encrypting another key with it. Any idea?

What is somewhat bothersome (and this would go for anything using CAPI
in the way your product does) is the reliance upon the windoze password.
If that were compromised, it seems all other CAPI integrated keys would
also be compromised. Let's hope they choose good passwords, and know not
to re-use the same one on the net somewhere. :-)
(BTW, does windoze allow arbitrary length passwords or phrases, or does
it
have a short limit?)

Jeremey.
