I think that the paper implies in several places that TTPs, if they
offer a CA service for public encryption keys, will also be required
to hold the private keys, and to hand the private keys over to the
government on demand.

This Q&A is not contradictory with this interpretation.

When they say that the TTP will not be able to decrypt the message,
what they mean is that it would be able to decrypt the message if the
message were given to it, but that that's not the way the GAK
architecture works.

What happens is they first obtain a authorisation for a wire tap, then
obtain copies of your email.  Then they go to the central access point
and ask for your private key.  Then *they* decrypt your email.  `The
TTP will not be able to access an encrypted message' in the sense that
they won't give it the message to decrypt.

This is bypassing the intent of the key-escrow/GAK functionality of a
TTP.  There is a section which discusses this, and makes it a design
criteria that users not be able to by pass the GAK function, whilst
making use of the signature certification function.  Personally, I'm
not sure that this is possible, as there a whole host of ways around
it.  (Use the signature key in the way you suggest, superencrypt,
subliminal channels, stego, etc).

This is the point which I think should be pushed: the only commercial
need for CKE (_commerical_ key escrow) is for _stored_ data.  Do you
see any corporations crying out to open their communications for
industrial espionage by DISSI, NSA, GCHQ, etc.?

I think there are several sections which imply that the TTP must keep
private encryption keys for any public encryption keys it holds (and
that it must allow government access to them).  There are many places
where the presumption is made that the TTP has the key to release to
government.
