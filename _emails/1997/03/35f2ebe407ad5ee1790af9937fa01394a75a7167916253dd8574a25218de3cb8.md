I liked "linux, a shareware program that is the operating system of choice
for hackers" and the "wide availability of tools for .. 'fingering'".

This reminded me how a couple of years ago I had a long phone conversation
with a journalist from the Washington Post who was convinced (by a certain
idiot from Usenet) that I'm running a hacker BBS. He kept asking me why its
not possible to finger anyone @dm.com. I explained that we're behind a dial-up
uucp connection, not tcp/ip - it was like talking to a wall. "Why are you
hiding behind this, ahem, ucp? What have you got to hide?" I pointed out that
one can't finger anyone @twp.com either - he didn't believe me and promised to
check. :-)
