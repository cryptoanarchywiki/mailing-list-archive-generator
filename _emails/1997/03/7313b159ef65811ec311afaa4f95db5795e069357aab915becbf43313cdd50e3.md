Dear Disney.com Guest:

Disney.com is about to improve its Guest Registration 
system.  Unfortunately, your personalized Disney.com 
Registration name is currently set to expire during the 
upgrade process.

You may prevent this from happening. If you wish to keep 
your current Disney.com Registration name and Password, all 
you need to do is update them by March 24.  Once you do, 
you'll remain eligible to enter all our contests and 
sweepstakes and continue receiving e-mail updates on what's 
new from Disney.

It's easy to update your Registration info!  Simply cut and 
paste (or copy) the following URL into your browser's 
"Address" or "Go To:" window:

  http://www.disney.com/Survey/ddc_registration/update.html

At the top of the Registration page, please type your 
Registration name and Password in the appropriate spaces. 
Then click the "Update my Registration" button and your 
information will be updated automatically.


Of course, if you don't update your Registration now, 
you'll still be able to enter contests at Disney.com any 
time after March 24 -- you simply won't be guaranteed your 
original Registration name and Password and you may have to 
register again.

We apologize for the inconvenience, and we thank you for 
visiting Disney.com!

Your friends at Disney.com
