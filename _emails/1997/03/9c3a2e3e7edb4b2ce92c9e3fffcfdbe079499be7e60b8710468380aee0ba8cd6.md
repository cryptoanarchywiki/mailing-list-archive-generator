A Moot-Court dry run of the upcoming CD_A_ hearing by the Supremes was
held Thursday in San Francisco and carried today by C-SPAN2.  

None other than our own M. J. Froomkin was one of the mock berobed ones.
His vigorous pro-CD_A_ probing of the ACLU anti-CD_A_ guys was probably
good practice for them, but he sure gave me the impression he really
believed what he was saying.

... Who has resolved to hold his nose and renew his ACLU membership.
