IMHO the remailer network needs to be extended so as to place the
risk on (too) many shoulders, thereby reducing it considerably.
The winsock remailer has an "shared" option included, meaning every
regular e-mail account could serve as a remailer (or at least as
middleman). If such an option could be included in e-mail programs,
the danger of remailers "dropping like flies left and right" would
cease.
The accounts could be published on a web page together with the
instructions a la Raph's remailer list and the country, where they
are located in. Therefore they could even serve as exit point, for
the laws of the receiver don't apply there. The only problem I see
with shared accounts though is a flood attack, rendering it unusable
for the account holder. So probably middleman or PGP-encrypted-only
are the most reasonable options.
Why not extending the source of Private Idaho to include remailer
capabilities, for example?
