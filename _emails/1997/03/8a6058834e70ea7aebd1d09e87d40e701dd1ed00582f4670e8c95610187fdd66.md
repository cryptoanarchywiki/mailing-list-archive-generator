TWP writes Page Oner on the FBI's computer upgrade
snafu for NCIC and national fingerprint info on demand, 
with multi-millions in overruns and mismanagement. 
It says that as a result Congress has refused initial $100m 
for digital wiretap and will not release funds until the feebies 
show technological and managerial competence.

Freeh and Gorelick claim they were misled on costs of the
upgrades by underlings. However, a feebie says that the 
budgets were deliberately under-priced to get approval, and
that everyone knew more would be needed. 

The implication is that $500 million is too low for DTA, but
that Congress thinks its way too high for bumblers.
