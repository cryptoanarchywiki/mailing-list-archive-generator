Ming-Ching Tiew <mctiew@csi.po.my> posted the following article to
sci.crypt.  Aside from its content being interesting, it poses
an interesting set of problems for ITAR proponents (:-) -
he's Malaysian, working from Malaysia, but his web page is on a 
US-located free-web-page server.  Some of the code on it is
marked US-only; other code is world-readable and on a machine in Germany.

Here at which you look for my Win32 File Encryptor
which uses "Cryptlib" :-

  http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/8298

The program is provided in source and binary. Non-US 
people should follow the re-direct and get it from 
the non-US site.

Some of the highlites ( all crypto-features derived from 
Cryptlib, credit to Peter Gutmann ),

(1) You don't use PGP for encryption and decryption.
    PGP is only used for Key Management.

(2) This is not a shell.

(3) Configure encryption options thru' GUI and
    save to registry. For example, if you don't 
    like IDEA, use something else, like Blowfish.

Find out for yourself "Cryptlib", the most comprehensive 
and yet freely available crypto library.

Ming-Ching
