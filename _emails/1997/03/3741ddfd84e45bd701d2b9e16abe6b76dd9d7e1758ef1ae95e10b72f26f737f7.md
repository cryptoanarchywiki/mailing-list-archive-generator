  If we can abort a fetus who is afflicted with a plethora of genetic
deformities,
in order to spare them a short life of wretched pain, then I think a
good case 
could be made that nuking new-borns in D.C. is a humanitarian gesture.
  Perhaps if our legislators passed a Bill requiring coathangers to be
provided
along with the free condoms handed out in D.C., (just in case)...
