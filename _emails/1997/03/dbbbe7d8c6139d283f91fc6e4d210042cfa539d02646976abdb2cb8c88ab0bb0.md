Hmm, could a NYM account maybe serve as entry and exit point for a
remailer? That would

- - have the advantage, that the remailer, the domain and the
operator aren't even known ("Anonymity for anonymous remailers" -
my former proposal of usage of "shared account" remailers becomes
an actual possibility here) and therefore shut-downs are unlikely.
With the exception of the NYM-account, which is trivial to replace.

- - make traffic analysis even harder, for alone by the reply block
chain an incoming and outgoing message would "disappear" in other
traffic, not to mention, that the NYM account remailer (and the
attached reply block chain) could be only one adress in an even
longer chain of remailers.

- - encrypt even plain-text messages at least on their way through the
reply block chain conventionally, thereby adding to resistance to
traffic analysis.

- - even out the message load of the available remailers by using
preferrably the remailers with only little traffic for the reply
block chain, yet again helping against traffic analysis of the
general remailer network.

Ciao
