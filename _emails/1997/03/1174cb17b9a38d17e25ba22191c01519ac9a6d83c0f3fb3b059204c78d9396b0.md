The following provision also causes me some doubts about
exactly what will be allowed for export:

(B) Exception.--The Secretary shall prohibit the
        export or reexport of particular
        software and computer hardware described in
        this subsection to an identified individual or
	organization in a specific foreign country if the
	Secretary determines that there is substantial
	evidence that such software and computer
	hardware will be--

(iv) intentionally used to evade
	enforcement of United States law or
	taxation by the United States or by
	any State or local government.

which could be construed to cover anonymous remailers,
fully anonymous digital cash, anything set up to verify
gambling fairness, and various other things of interest
to Cypherpunks (including the use of PGP by, say, a drug
"kingpin"). Admittedly, the "identified individual
or organization in a specific foreign country" will
help in limiting this application.
	-Allen
