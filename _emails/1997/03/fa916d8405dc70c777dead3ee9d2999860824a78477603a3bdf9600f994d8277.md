	I see it at a security meeting each month.  Its a good summary
of the last month's advisories, but if you're on bugtraq & BOS, it
won't add new data.

	If you've unsubscribed due to time, its probably worth the
money.

| Bob, just a quick question, have you heard/seen anything on this:
| 
| |            The SANS Network Security Digest                   |
| |                 Contributing Editors:                         |
| |    Michele Crabb, Matt Bishop, Steve Bellovin, Rob Kolstad    |
| |   Gene Spaford, Marcus Ranum, Gene Schultz, Dorothy Denning   |
| ----A Resource for Computer and Network Security Professionals---
| 
| It's an $80/yr e-mail newsletter; there are a lot of recognizable names
| there, but the thing isn't digitally signed.  Also, isn't it "Spafford"?
| Anyway, anything you know would be appreciated, and if you don't know
| anything, could you ask around (e.g., some of the likelier mailing lists
| which I no longer subscribe to.)
