Counterexample: 200, or even 2000, years ago, it was trivially easy for
someone in a village to essentially kill the entire village by doing any
one of several things. For example, one could open the dam gates at night,
thus leaving the village with no water for crops or drinking. Or one could
open the pens holding the village's sheep and goats, thus casusing many of
them to be irretrievably lost. Or, most obviously, one could play the
Trojan Horse role and let the enemy into the village at night. (Examples of
all of these actions may be found in the usual places.)

And 200 years ago it was of course quite possible for a "traitor" to signal
the enemy, let the enemy in, etc. This happened in our own Revolutionary
War, and probably has happened in all wars.

What are these "great freedoms of the past"? Look to history.
