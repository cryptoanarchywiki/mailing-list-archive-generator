>What market force or natural selection discourages "abuse"?

Well before the STATIST took over there was an unwritten Parent/Child
contract. The parrent would raise and care for their children and in old
age the parents would be taken care of by their children.

This "contract" or "bond" has been distroyed by a multi-pronged attack by
the STATE.

- -- The STATE has usurped the power of the parents to raise their chlidren.
- -- The STATE has taken the responsibility of the children to care for their
parents in old age. -- The STATE has actively distroyed the two parent
household with Welfair programs & making it "politicaly incorrect" for a
woman to be a housewife not to mention thier EEO policies.

It should be intresting to note that no one ever mentions the economic
affect of doubling the number of workers compeeting for the same jobs by
having women entering the workforce. Basic economics show that this drives
down the rate of pay of all workers (suply & demand) making it quite hard
for a man to support his family with 1 job enabling his wife to stay at
home and raise their children. So even where you still have a two parent
household the STATE winds up rasing the children because both parents are
required to work just to survive.
