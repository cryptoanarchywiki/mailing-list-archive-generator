  The same is true today. Both government and industry operate on the
principle that control over money/employment is the ring which they can
place through the noses of the populace in order to lead them into any
type of freedom-delimiting pen they wish.
  If you want your children to eat, then you had best be prepared to
piss into a jar when told to do so.
  The government and business are able to foist innumerable atrocities
on the populace just by virtue of screwing them around in so many ways
that they can only focus their energy in overcoming a few of them.
  A woman who has to spend five years fighting for the right not to be
passed over for promotion for having ovaries is not likely to have a lot
of energy left over for fighting against having to piss in a jar, as
well.

  Big Brother and Big Business chip away at a thousand 'petty' freedoms
and act like they are being noble and gracious when they return a few
to the citizens after long, hard battles against doing so.
