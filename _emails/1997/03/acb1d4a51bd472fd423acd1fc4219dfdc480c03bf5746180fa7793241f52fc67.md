John - do Cypherpunks like to play superhero and help people who are being
hacked? A woman called who says someone had rboken into her system
reprogrammed certain controls causing her to be instantly trackable
whenever she logged in, no matter what account she used, no matter
from where, etc.

She says it happens *every* time.

Law enforcement is baffled and has no advice (surprise, surprise).

She said the FBI even recommended she hire a hacker to play along with the
culprit and see if they couldn't catch him that way.

So, if you or anyone you know is interested in a weekend sporting
event, you can reach Debra Wellman at the home of her mother 510 855 9744

I spoke with her on the phone. She is not crazy, just frustrated.

	Dennis
