Wei Dai!  Long time no read!  I hope to see more articles from
you.

I've suggested it several times.  I'm curious who else has 
proposed it.


<snip on game model of problem>


Nice!  I look forward to part 2.  (And part 3, where you go 
ahead and account for the cost of signing up for digital 
payment systems and the cost of managing each 
deposit/payment...)



I think the major problems with the proposal are first making 
digital payment systems ubiquitous and second making the
"unsolicited mail good faith deposit" idea ubiquitous.



Hm.  If we could somehow make the _idea_ gain.. er.. 
"currency" then the problem of spammers would cause more 
people to adopt digital payment systems.  _That_ would be
making a blessing from a curse!
