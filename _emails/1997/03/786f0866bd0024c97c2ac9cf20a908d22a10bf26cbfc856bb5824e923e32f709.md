Well the best way to aviod all this is to "Home School". In the end they
will get a much better education and they woun't turn out to be lock-step
robots for the STATE.

This requires a two parent home though (politically incorrect these days)
and a wife with a few brain cells. :)

The next best thing is a private school but even they are being corrupted
by all this touchy feely crap. Still better than sending them to the
STATE'S reeducation centers.
