  I emailed the majordomo and it sent back a message saying, "I am not
a Bot."
It also added that from now on, it prefers to be addressed as 
'Major Domo', with proper respect for its rank.

  The situation is worse than I thought. Not only are the humans on the
list being replaced by Bots, but the Bots seem to be evolving and/or
mutating to emulate human characteristics.
  Also, I recently received a reply from a Bot that had an English 
accent and said it was having a "Baaaad day". I could smell wet wool,
too. I would suggest keeping an eye out for headers that contain the
words "Sender: toad.clone".
