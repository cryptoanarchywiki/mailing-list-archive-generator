1. Full 128-bit encryption world wide

VeriSure is a Java-based applet that is automatically loaded when
your customers need to access a secure site with 128 bits encryption.

Browsers exported from the USA are crippled by 40 bit
encryption because USA export regulations prevent export of 128 bit
encryption. 40 bit encryption is easily broken with enough time
and computing power.

VeriSure extends those browsers to 128 bits to provide
highly secure encryption (currently unbreakable), regardless of
whether they are in the USA.

This means you can offer your customers secure online transaction
facilities such as banking, investment and other financial services.

PowerWeb which is a high performance full 128-bit secure server
*********************************************************************
CompuSource also offers PowerWeb which is a full 128-bit secure server
with unlimited RSA encryption using industry standard SSL 3.0 (and 2.0),
providing HTTP, FTP, SMTP and POP3 services, with many extensions
for rapid database application development and dynamic page content.
__________________________________________________________________

2. Proven SSL 3.0 technology

VeriSure uses proven SSL 3.0 technology which provides
authentication of servers and implements encrypted message digests
on every packet to ensure data integrity against tampering,
as well as 128 bit encryption for privacy and unlimited bits RSA
encryption for authentication.

VeriSure does not use SSL 2.0 which has several well known
flaws, especially regarding message digests.

The message digest authenticates the message against tampering
or forgery which is especially important for financial transactions.
Let's say a third party intercepts a message across the network and
decrypts it. The value to that third party is limited to the
content of the information of that single message, because that
third party cannot create new messages for two reasons:
the encryption key changes with every message and every message
is authenticated with a message digest which cannot be reverse
computed.
__________________________________________________________________

3. Protection against Java viruses

Each VeriSure is protected by only allowing connections to specified
sites. This protection is built into VeriSure by way of public key
cryptography which means that other malicious applets or viruses
cannot manipulate this information.

VeriSure also performs SSL 3.0 authentication of the remote server upon
every connection, thereby assuring customers of the true identity
of the server they are connecting to.
__________________________________________________________________

4. Features

VeriSure is built upon industry standards which means that you don't
need custom server solutions. Being built upon standard Java 1.02 or later,
it runs on any customer machine that has a web browser that supports
Java, regardless of operating system.
128 bit Browser and Server Solution

The VeriSure classes are available for licensing for third party
application development.
__________________________________________________________________

5. Hardware and Software Requirements

VeriSure is available for any platform that supports Java and has
a Java-enabled web browser, including: AIX, Solaris,
Windows NT, Windows 95, OS/2, MVS, OS/400.
__________________________________________________________________

6. Support

CompuSource provides support to licensees of VeriSure, who in turn
must support their customers.
