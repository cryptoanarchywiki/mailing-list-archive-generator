Tim:

Last Thursday night I got word of Perry's shut down from the PGP Users List;
I had
not seen it posted during the day so I forwarded it to the cypherpunks list.

It showed up at my location 5 minutes ago.

I have the consolation of knowing mine was not the only one delayed.

I seem to have noticed messages being repeated this afternoon.
