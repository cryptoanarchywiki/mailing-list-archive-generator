[................]These
technologists, who planned to release their findings in a news
release on Thursday, argue that the best way to insure that
the strongest security codes are developed is to conduct the
work in a public forum. And so they are sharply critical of
the current industry standard setting process which has made
a trade secret of the underlying mathematical formulas used to
create the security codes.
......................................


It becomes apparent that some people have the ideas of "private" and
"public" backwards - they do in secret what should be done openly while
supporting the license to access what should be private matters.
