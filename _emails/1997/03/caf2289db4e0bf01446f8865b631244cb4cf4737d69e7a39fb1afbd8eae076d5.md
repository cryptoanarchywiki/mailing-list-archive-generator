I've been reading a thread in the Usenet newsgroups alt.cypherpunks and
comp.org.eff.talk. EFF, you may recall, is Cocksucker John Gilmore's setup,
and a pair of Gilmore/EFF's stooges - llurch@quixote.stanford.edu (Rich
Graves <rcgraves@disposable.com>) and sethf@athena.mit.edu (Seth
Finkelstein) - have been posting lies in an effort to rewrite the recent
events which have totally destroyed Cocksucker's reputation on the net.

This is a lie. I haven't mailbombed cypherpunks. The list moved from
toad.com to multiple sites because the readers no longer trusted Gilmore to
host the list. In article <5gkfag$36o@quixote.stanford.edu> he also wrote:

Rich is lying...

>Vulis also posted megabytes of Serdar Argic screeds, just to be annoying,

More lies. I haven't posted megabytes of Serdar Argic materials, and I have
repeatedly stated that it is NOT my intention to disrupt the mailing list.

Is that why John Gilmore is sending his minions to post lies and to
confuse the readers about what was happening?

In response, sethf@athena.mit.edu (Seth Finkelstein) further wrote
in article <5gmnuj$1ha@senator-bedfellow.MIT.EDU>:

>>>In any case, I personally would not ever absolutely reject posts

Again, this is not true. I disagree with many of the things Declan says, but
I'm not smearing him and not slinging mud at him. I'm also not aware of
having being banned from any forum Declan moderates, whatever that is.

Seth further has the audacity to praise John Gilmore for showing the
"patience of a saint":

>	It wasn't up to Vulis level, absolutely. But I think taking
>the junk from Vulis showed the patience of a saint.

This is actually very funny.
