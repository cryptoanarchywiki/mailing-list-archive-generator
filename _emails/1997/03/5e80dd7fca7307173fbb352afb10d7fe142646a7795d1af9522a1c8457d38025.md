Unfortunately, New York City is the home to several people who in a
more restrictive society would have been committed - Case Iverson,
Ray Arachelian, the lying crackpot Charles Platt from alt.torture...

Neither Gilmore nor Sandfart have cocks long enough to reach from
California... But Iverson may be sucking Arachelian's cock.

With difficulty. A program's output would likely sound more intelligent.

Yes, but it's a very low bandwidth channel capable of transmitting
single digits only.

A very good point, Paul.

You may have noticed that Cocksucker John Gilmore spreads lies and
disinformation, he makes up hard numbers which can be proven to be false -
but it would require an effort that could be used more productively e.g. on
setting up more remailers. Consider several of Cocksucker John Gilmore's
recent claims made through his subservient mouthpiece Rich Graves. In
article <5gl63i$4eu@quixote.stanford.edu> Cocksucker John Gilmore wrote:

This is a lie. I haven't mailbombed cypherpunks. There were several mail
loops during the list's existance on toad.com, none of which were caused by
me. The list moved because of Gilmore's censorship, which Graves forgets to
mention at all. list. In article <5gkfag$36o@quixote.stanford.edu>

The cypherpunks mailing list is archived at several sites. As I pointed out,
it's possible to search the archives and to verify that in the several years
that I've been on this list, there was not a single day when I posted 50
articles; not a single day when I posted even 15 articles; and probably less
than 10 days when I posted more than 5 articles. Cocksucker John Gilmore
is lying again. In the same article Gilmore/Graves wrote:

>Vulis also posted megabytes of Serdar Argic screeds, just to be annoying,
>and with the stated intention of disrupting the list. That's called a
>denial of service attack.

More lies. I have repeatedly stated that it is NOT my intention to disrupt
the mailing list. The total size of the Serdar Argic material is under 200K.
I'd be surprised if the total size of my contributions to cypherpunks over
the years adds up to more than a couple of megabytes.

But of course we know that Cocksucker John Gilmore is a pathological liar,
so we can do something more useful than digging through the archives.
