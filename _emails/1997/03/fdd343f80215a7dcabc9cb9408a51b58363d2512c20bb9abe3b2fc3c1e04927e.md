The Navy backs that disinfo-scumbag Chomsky as well.  But, the Navy
isn't number one - they took the pres' over to Walter Reed first to
remove the brain and bullets before shipping the corpse back to
Bethesda for the "autopsy".  Hence the reference in the official FBI
report to "surgery in the head area" when the body was removed from
the cheap shipping coffin in the body bag.
