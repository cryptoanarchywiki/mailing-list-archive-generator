There are two separate documents here which people are getting confused.  The
first is the text of the Wassenaar arrangement, which is quite short and (as
described by one person who's seen it) "consists of a lot of weasel words".
The second is the one which sets down what is controlled.  This is rather
lengthy, around 100 pages.  The EAR changes which were made in the US contains
some of the text of this document, which predates Wassenaar and is just the
older COCOM text under a new title.  The COCOM text originates from the US, 
and some of the countries still have versions with US spellings even though 
the countries use proper :-) Englishm which indicates its origins.
