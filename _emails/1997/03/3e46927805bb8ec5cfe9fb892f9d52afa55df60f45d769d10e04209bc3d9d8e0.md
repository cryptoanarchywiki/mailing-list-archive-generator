I think you don't need to keep Bob .. just lookup K with L.  Less
email addresses is a good thing.

The counter argument I suppose is that the Feds, or anyone else who
reads Bobs email can then ask for the key.  But if they can read his
email, they can already read it once he requests the key.  It would
allow an eavesdropper to do a DoS attack against Bob, request all his
emails before he can.

Why is this a problem?  You have accept lists for remailers between
themselves.  A private remailer (one not advertising itself on these
lists) just mimics Alice in retreiving the email ... waits a while
then requests the key.

You can provide a web interface to do it for him.

Or, you can offer the option that if he includes the encrypted message
in his request you will decrypt it for him, by return of email.

Don't keep the addresses as above -- treat the nonce L as the
identitiy.

Random pool like PGP, it's one way and the pool has more bits than the
key material the Feds have anyway.  /dev/urandom is nice.

Yes.  A good solution also.  Perhaps we can write a nice remailer
which has a web forms interface for configuration, lots of radio
buttons etc to allow the proud new remailer in a box owner to
configure his remailer, and pretty stats graphs.

[o] discard / keep
if keep how long for [...]

etc.

Then let the remailer operator play with settings and see which works
out best for him.

I think you're arguing for your discard all policy :-)

btw if you're interested to fix the keyserver so that it requires an
ack to a ping with a nonce, someone at MIT has a fast PGP key database
/ web key server which isn't using PGPs linear lookup.  You can find a
link to it from Brian LaMachia's keyserver page.

Another snazzy thing to do to the keyserver would be to have it obtain
a timestamp signature on your key (from a third party time stamping
service, of which there are several) and include that too.
