I saw a Usenet article that some Cypherpunks might like:

"Seaford Int." <seaford@napri.sk> writes:

> BE AFRAID OF NEW RUSSIAN ECONOMY BANDITS!!!

> VOTE, NO MORE ENTRY FOR RUSSIANS TO CIVILIZATED COUNTRIES.

And now for something crypto-relevant:

I want to set up an easy-to-use, not necessarily very secure, anon server
at dm.com. Can someone please send me some source code (or pointer thereto).
(I mean, a system similar to what Julf used to have on anon.penet.fi, not
mixmaster, etc - I know where these are.)
