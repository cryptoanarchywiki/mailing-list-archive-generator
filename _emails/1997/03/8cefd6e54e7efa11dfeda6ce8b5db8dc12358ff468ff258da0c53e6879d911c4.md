When: Tuesday April 1, 1997 7PM
Where: Nashua, NH Public Library, 2 Court St, Nashua, NH.
Topic: Robert Hettinga, founding moderator of the Digital Commerce Society of
Boston.

The NH INTERNET SIG (Special Interest Group) welcomes you to its monthly
meeting, the first Tuesday of every month.
The next meeting will be on April 1st and will focus on the technology and
social consequences of digital commerce and financial
cryptography. Mr. Hettinga is also general chair of Financial Cryptography
1997, the world's first conference on Financial Cryptography.

However, financial cryptography, the technology which
underlies digital commerce in its most secure form, will have much more
profound implications than merely the simplification of sales and
distribution. It permits us to make anonymous *cash* transactions for
everything from a billion-dollar foriegn exchange trade to, probably, the
switching of internet packets themselves.
If this promise is kept, it could change the fundamentals of our entire
society.

Please check out Mr. Hettinga's web site:http://www.vmeng.com/rah/

This meeting promises to be fun and informative for both the technical and
non-technical computer users.
