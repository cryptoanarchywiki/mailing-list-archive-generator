I don't dispute this.  If a "crime" is defined as whatever the 
politicos/bureaucrats/hoodlums say it is, then a "crime" is certainly 
being committed.  (Of course there is another definition of crime.)

"If voting could change anything, it would have been outlawed long ago."  
Not strictly true.  But if I vote or don't vote...well it's just about 
the same difference as whether I buy a lottery ticket or not.

Don't vote - it only ENCOURAGES them!

Citizenship, Schmitizenship.  Granted I don't want to renounce my 
citizenship - at least not at the moment.  But the whole game of riling 
up people's emotions about "citizenship" and "patriotism" is just a bread 
and circuses ruse to keep us focused on something other than what the 
professional control freaks are doing to us.

The people who made handgun ownership a felony should be sent down a dark 
alley without any means of self-defense.  Perhaps they would gain a small 
glimmer of understanding of the real issues - unless they already 
understand that they are the hoodlums around the corner in the dark 
alley.  In that case....

Lawmakers can hardly be held responsible for tying their own shoes!  I 
suspect you had your satire mode on full when you wrote this.
