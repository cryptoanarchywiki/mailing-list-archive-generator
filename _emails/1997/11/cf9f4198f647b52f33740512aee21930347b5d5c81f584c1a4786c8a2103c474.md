Just FYI, "Monty Cantsin" is not a real person.  According the the Neoism
web site (See "Monty's" posts for URL), "Everybody can BE Monty Cantsin,
but nobody IS Monty Cantsin." Same goes for Smile Magazine.  Neoism
encourages its adherents to start their own Smile Magazine.  Go figure...

We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that

that ye were our countrymen."
