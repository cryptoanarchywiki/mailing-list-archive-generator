See? Even other countries are agreeing that crypto is munitions.
  i.e. - They all want to sell versions of their 'old stuff' to people
in other countries, so that Big Violent People can continue to profit
off of, support and encourage Little Violent People.

Anybody know any Drug Barons or International Terrorists (TM) who 
can't get themselves and their lackeys all of the firepower they 
require to 'take care of business'?
Anyone think crypto-munitions will not follow the same pattern of
being taken out of the hands of hands of the 'potential drug baron
and international terroist' average citizens, and reserved for
those who have self-actualized their dreams and actually _become_
drug barons and international terrorists?

Government oppressed free-enterprise at it's finest...
