No, this judge is guilty of false imprisonment, if I kidnapped you and 
falsely imprisoned you for 3 years in a 6x9 cell where you would live 
with another inmate, and prison officers who may turn a blind eye when 
you were raped by the other prisoners, I should be expecting to die for 
my crimes.

No, I support flogging of graffiti vandals (killing for repeat 
offenders), and assasinations as a means of removing government 
criminals, nuking is too indiscriminate.
