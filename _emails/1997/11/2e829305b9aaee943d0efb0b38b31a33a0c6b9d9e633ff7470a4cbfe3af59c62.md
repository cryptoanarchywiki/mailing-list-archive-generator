* While her colleagues were debating, in July, whether the New
Life Massage Parlor was a front for prostitution, Oak Grove, Ky.,
City Councilwoman Patty Belew, 26, said she already had enough
information to decide.  She said she knows for sure that the
massage parlor paid bribes to some police officers to ignore
prostitution because she used to work there.
