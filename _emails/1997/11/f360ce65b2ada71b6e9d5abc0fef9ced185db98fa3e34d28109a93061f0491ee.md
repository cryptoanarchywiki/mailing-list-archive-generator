-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This is to announce version 0.1 of pgp5-pine, a set of shell (sh) scripts
for integrating pgp 5.x for unix into the pine mail reader. The scripts
operate via pine's facility for filters, both incoming and outgoing.

You can encrypt, decrypt, sign, and verify messages with some ease. The
send filter will automagically retrieve keys from a keyserver if told
to do so, and leans toward paranoia when it cannot encrypt a message.

This is the first released version, there is always the possibility
of bugs and/or behaviors you don't agree with. Note that these scripts 
do _not_ handle PGP/MIME, as pine does not pass the MIME structure of 
messages to filters.

Disclaimer: I am not responsible for the choice of colors on the 
            cypherpunks.to web site, or any damage to anything yours
            from using this code.

Please direct all bug reports, requests, or other inquiries to
