In general, you can't.  Many interesting problems are NP,
so you can quickly tell from the output whether it matches the input,
but many more interesting problems are not, especially in crypto.
Often there's a special form that lets you detect
false positives, but for false negatives you're usually out of luck.
And for complex calculations other than searches, 
such as numerical stuff, you usually lose too.

The common solution, which also covers "this machine started looking
but stopped and didn't tell me", is to assign problem space
to multiple users (and hope they don't collude :-).
Random search is surprisingly effective, and has the
advantage that it doesn't require coordination.
It's sometimes helpful to structure the searches a bit
so you can easily compare results from multiple players.
