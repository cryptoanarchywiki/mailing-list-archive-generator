No, the original context was my statement that I had been robbed three
times at gunpoint, and that having a gun wouldn't have made any
difference at the time.  Ben wasn't there and doesn't have a clue
about the circumstances (of course), but felt free to comment (in
essence) that I must be stupid to let someone get the drop on me.

That's macho bullshit.  There is no perfect defense, and my example 
was to demonstrate that simple fact.

Please note that I didn't say that guns were *always* worthless.  So
Ben's example of ratting on someone and then packing heat to scare off
people who might retaliate is the real red herring.  It also obviously
demonstrates a certain amount of basic, dealing-with-life kind of
cluelessness on his part, for other reasons I won't go into.
