I shook down their entire web site and could find no indication that
these fuckers even existed before Oct. 30/97. (Shortly before their
announcement of the supposed million dollar encryption challenge
that expired in May/97, which no cryptographer I know has ever 
seemed to have heard of.)
It is also interesting that there seems to be no actual mention of
real, live people connected to their corporation, whom one can
contact. (Although there is contact information for their press
agents.)

Meganet is either one of the best Bad-Encryption spoofs to the list,
to date, or one of the best Bad-Encryption scams going.
Maybe Maganet was formed by the press agent that DataETRetch fired.
That would explain why they only seemed to have offered their
challenge to corporations with no cypherpunks in them.

I will shortly be announcing my Million Dollar Encryption Challenge
which, unfortunately, expired on Jan 1, 1754.
(However, if you check the Document Source on the files at my web
site, they will confirm that the HTML document announcing the
challenge was created in 1753.)
