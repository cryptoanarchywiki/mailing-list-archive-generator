SUMMARY: Britain is thinking of moving to a government/corporate
 merger system of secret intelligence agencies, but without making
 it an 'open secret' as is done in the US.

Bickford revealed that, in 1995, the intelligence agencies had secretly 
suggested to the Major government that they develop links to large 
companies in order to provide them with "protective business 
intelligence".

The main threat to Britain now was "serious economic crime" and 
"super-terrorism", involving the use of weapons of mass destruction, he 
said. 

Not only were "operational officers with long experience in 
intelligence" being lost to the private sector, others were lost because 
they had to take up management posts instead of carrying on in
intelligence. Tax payers were having to pay for this "waste of
experience", Bickford claimed. 

A new "national intelligence agency" should be formed, he added, in 
order to provide protective business intelligence. It could even charge 
for its services. It was "long overdue" for the Parliamentary 
Intelligence Oversight Committee to instigate the process of 
amalgamating the three agencies. 

Bickford's call for more intelligence and security expertise for 
business was backed by Sir Peter Imbert, former Commissioner of the 
Metropolitan Police, and other senior ex-police officers.

POST-SUMMARY: Truth in Fascism will allow for greater efficiency in
  sending citizens and troops overseas to die for Texaco and Pepsico,
  since there will no longer be a need to waste time and resources
  on promoting some bullshit 'freedom and democracy' claptrap to
  justify the murder of foreigners who fuck with corporate cash
  flow.
