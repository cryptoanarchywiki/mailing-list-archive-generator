Or tell them to fuck off.

I was stopped by the storm troopers on the Stanford University campus for
this reason--"you fit the profile"--and asked to let them inspect my
briefcase and jacket pockets. I stood my ground and said "No."

Of course, Stanford being private property, they escorted me off the campus.

(However, it was Stanford Sheriffs, representing the (alleged) city of
Stanford, CA, who did the stop-and-escort-off routine, so one wonders about
the lines being blurred between private and governmental functions.)

As computers proliferate, "fitting the profile" is becoming the de facto
way to stop any suspicious persons, or others they want to harass.
