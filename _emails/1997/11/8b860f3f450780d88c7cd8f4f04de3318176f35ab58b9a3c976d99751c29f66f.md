Apparently shaking a baby to death is a lesser crime than opposing
government fascism and having a continuing interest in chemistry.

And people wonder why the militia movement is gaining strength every day.

The au pair Louise Woodward will serve less time in jail than Jim Bell
will. While Bell languishes in a Washington state jail, awaiting (for
almost 7 months!!) his sentence, the convicted babykiller is now free.

I guess having a couple of fake SS tattoos, er, "numbers," and possibly
opening a vial of mercaptin where some people would smell it, is a more
serious crime than shaking a baby to death.

Only in Amerika.

Lock and load.
