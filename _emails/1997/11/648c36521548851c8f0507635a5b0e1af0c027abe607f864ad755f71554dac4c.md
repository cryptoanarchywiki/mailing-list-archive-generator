*** U.S. cyberterrorism report hit on encryption stance

The U.S. commission on critical infrastructure was criticized
Wednesday for endorsing the Clinton administration's policy requiring
government access to all private computer data. Sen. Patrick Leahy
said key questions had been raised about costs and feasibility of
so-called key recovery systems. "Until those significant questions
are ... answered, we should be cautious in adopting grand key
recovery encryption schemes that may exacerbate system
vulnerabilities," Leahy said. The commission's report warned key
telephone, power, water and financial systems were increasingly
vulnerable to computer attack. For story
