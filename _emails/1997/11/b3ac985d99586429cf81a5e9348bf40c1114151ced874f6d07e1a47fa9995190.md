I have mentioned this a few times before, but apparently some are not
aware. People who want to attend the Essential Information Conference on
Microsoft, and who do not have funding for the conference fee, can
easily receive a scholarship by sending a note to Donna Colvin, who can
be reached at dcolvin@essential.org (fax 202.234.5176).  This is
available to anyone, including people who work in industry or
government.

Conference info is on the web at http://www.appraising-microsoft.org
