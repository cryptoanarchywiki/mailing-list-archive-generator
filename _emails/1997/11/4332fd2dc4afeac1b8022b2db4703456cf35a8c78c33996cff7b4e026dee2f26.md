You moron, the Americans who died while fighting in Korea, Vietnam,
Panama, Grenada (did any Americans die there?), Haiti, Iraq, etc were
fighting for an evil cause. It's a pity they died, but I've been rooting
for VC. Going back a few years, I have no sympathy for the Americans
who died fighting for the North in the Civil war, or fighting Spain
over the Philippines, or fighting the Philippine freedom fighters,
or exterminating the Indians.  There's no glory in the military.
Clinton is doing a Good Thing by whoring off the plots.

By the way, have the names of the Clinton supporters who bought
the plots been published?  I wonder if that Chinese guy was among them.

How much are the plots anyway?
