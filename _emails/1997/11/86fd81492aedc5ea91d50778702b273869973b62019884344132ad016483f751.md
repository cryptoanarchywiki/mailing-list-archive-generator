Learn how to take advantage of the potential effects of El Nino on the agricultural commodities markets!!

El Nino is a weather system forecasted by the National Weather Service to cause weather changes that could affect global agricultural production over the next 9 to 10 months.  El Nino is associated with droughts in the Western Pacific and irregular temperatures and rainfall across North America, South America, Central America and Africa. 

Some weather experts say the 1997/1998 El Nino could be the worst one in 150 years.  The 1982-1983 El Nino was the strongest of the century, spreading drought, floods, and extreme weather conditions across vast stretches of the globe.  Total combined losses to property and agriculture from related weather catastrophes are estimated to have exceeded $10 billion.

If the 1997/1998 El Nino comes close to the effects of the 1982/1983 El Nino there could be many opportunities in the futures and options market.

The price moves of agricultural commodities for the 1982 / 1983 growing season were as follows:

Soybeans  10/82- $5.18/bushel  to  9/83- $9.60/bushel     +85.32%	$22,100 gain per contract
