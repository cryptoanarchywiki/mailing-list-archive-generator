Until recently it was legal for U.S. folks to invest at they saw fit,
modulo that they could not invest in Cuba, Yemen, N. Korea, Eastasia,
Oceania, and other such Enemies of the People.

And a U.S. company could not export expertise to a foreign site to avoid
the export laws (ITARS, now EARs). Thus, RSA could not send Rivest and
others to Estonia to develop s/w to bypass U.S. export laws. (In a sense,
Rivest is non-exportable.)

All this may be changing, for the worse.

The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1995 made _financial_ support of some list of
organizations illegal. This list was finally published, and includes a few
dozen "terrorist" organizations.

This has been interpreted by many to mean that charitable donations to one
of the listed groups, the Irish Republican Army, for example, could be a
crime.

Will some of these offshore crypto and software companies be placed on this
list? Will this make investment in these companies a crime under the
Anti-Terrorism Act?

I believe this will happen. Maybe not next year, but within five years.
