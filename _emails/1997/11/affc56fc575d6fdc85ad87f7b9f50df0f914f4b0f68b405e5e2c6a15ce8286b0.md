Unable to comply, for obvious reasons.

If an address points back to a real address, then it's not *ANONYMOUS*, 
though.

Anon.penet.fi was *NOT* an anonymous remailer, though.  It was a "pseudonym
server".  The fact that it maintained a database by which posts could be
"traced back to a real address" is the main reason why it's no longer in
operation.  Maintaining that sort of information is an open invitation for
abuse by censorious elements, such as the "Church" of $cientology.

The chilling effect of knowing that identifying information is available for
abusive individuals and organizations to demand amounts to a form of
censorship through intimidation.

Ultimately, IMO, you harm the anti-UCE cause when you bundle it with an
anti-privacy agenda which requires broadcasting one's identity as the price
of free expression.

This message, for example, uses neither method to attain anonymity, yet it
would be banned from comp.org.cauce.
