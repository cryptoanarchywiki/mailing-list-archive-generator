>    The Great Awakening (Second Turning, 1727-1746) began as a spiritual
>    revival in the Connecticut Valley and reached an hysterical peak in
>    the northern colonies (in 1741) with the preachings of George
>    Whitefield and the tracts of Jonathan Edwards.  The enthusiasm split
>    towns and colonial assemblies, shattered the "old light"
>    establishment, and pitted young believers in "faith" against elder
>    defenders of "works."  After bursting polite conventions and lingering
>    Old World social barriers, the enthusiasm receded during King George's
>    War.
