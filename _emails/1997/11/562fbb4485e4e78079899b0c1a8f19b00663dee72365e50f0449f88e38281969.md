I made similar comments unrelated to Stephen's case in my "Basis of FCC jurisdiction" rant posted to Cypherpunks and Telecom Regulation lists in September of '96.

"I've been wondering lately about the jurisdictional limits of the FCC
vis-a-vis the Article(s) of the Constitution from which they derive their
authority.  My understanding is that the FCC is empowered under the Fed's
interstate commerce clauses.  If so, how valid is their jurisdiction over
low power and/or millimeter wave transmissions.  It seems a case can be
made that such transmissions represent little or no possibility of
interstate transmission."
