I have so many issues with this, I don't even know where to start.

ftp://ftp.loc.gov/pub/thomas/c105/s1482.is.txt writes:

What is the World Wide Web?  The Bill doesn't even attempt to define
it.  Is Usenet a part of it?  Are FTP sites a part of it?

If I have a link to a "bad" site, am I bad?  How about if I have a
forwarding link?

Anyway, AltaVista is certainly part of the WWW.  It is in the business
of the commercial distribution of material.  It does Usenet queries,
some of which are certainly harmful to minors (according to Coats).

They go down.

Note that "article" and "writing" are included.

Is Coats saying that his definition of "harmful to minors" is too vague?
Why can't he define it correctly in the Bill itself?

By the way, my signature contains an ascii art rendition of an adult
about to have sex with a child.  I believe that (i) it appeals to a
prurient interest in sex; (ii) it depicts, in a patently offensive way,
a simulated sexual act; and (iii) lacks any value whatsoever.

Now all I need to do is put it up on a web page on a for-profit company.
