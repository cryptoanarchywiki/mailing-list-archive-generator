Actually, even when their knee-jerk security measures are relaxed it isn't publicized, probably for concern it might encourage would be mules and terrorists to take advantage of 'relaxed' security measures.  Case in point profiling and John Gilmore's run-in with airport security last year.  As I recall, John purchased his ticket with cash within 24-hour of departure and had only carry-on items.  He was subjected to what he felt were requests for an unnecessary search of his carry-on and person.  

At the beginning of November and unannounced to the public, and seemingly unknown to most airline employees, such searches are now unnecessary under FAA regulation (don't have the particular citing).  Although notice of this change should have been posted in most airline employee break areas, few if any airlines offer regular rule update training to their ground personnel.  As a result many airline service agents continue the practice since its better to be safe... If a passenger objects and asks for a supervisor and assuming the sup is up to date on the regulations, they should not now be required to undergo this ordeal.
