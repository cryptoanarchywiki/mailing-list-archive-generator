BTW, I was farting around and discovered that I could change the
password on a revoked secret key. This means that someone can crack
the password on your revoked secret key if they have access to it.
This would make your new key vulnerable if you used the same password.

I suppose this qualifies as PGP trivia, but if it saves the life of
just one fascist dicator...
