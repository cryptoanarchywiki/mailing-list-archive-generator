When I read this a quote from Independance Day came to mind. The aliens just
blew up New York and a cable exec is sitting in his car. As the firestorm
comes towards him and he's facing both immiment death by being crushed by
cars displaced by the explosion and becoming a Whopper(tm) from the
firestorm he looks out and says simply:

"Ohhhhhhhh craaaaaaap."
