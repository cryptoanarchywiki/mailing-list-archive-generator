About 15 years ago I was trying to break the code in some software
distributed by some Canadian folks... (It was cheap to buy, and
I was doing it for fun.) Basically, every customer's executables
were almost completely different because they were encrypted with
a totally different key and decrypted at runtime.  The trick was to
disassemble the decryption code and to compare the decryption
results from two copies to see where the customer name was embedded.
