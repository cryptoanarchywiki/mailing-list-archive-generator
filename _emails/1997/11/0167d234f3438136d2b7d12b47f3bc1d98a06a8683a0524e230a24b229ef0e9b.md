I am simply delighted to see that there is a cypherpunk/ferret connection.
They are charming animals; you simply have not lived until you have had one
deploy its highly evolved predatory instincts to pull the insoles out of all
your shoes and hide them under the bed, along with all the attachments from
the vacuum cleaner.

Feel free to post this, if you like.
