That makes about as much sense as holding a rally to protest auto theft and
requiring that each attendee leave his car UNLOCKED in the parking lot while
attending.  In this case, the price of admission to this "anti-UCE party" is
to contribute one's e-mail address to the UCErs' mailing lists!

And what, exactly, is the point of requiring "belligerant spammers and 
trolls" to post with a valid e-mail address?  Unless they're planning to
spam or mailbomb each other, they are the ones who have the least to fear
from publicly broadcasting their e-mail addresses on a worldwide NG for the
address harvesters to collect and exploit.
