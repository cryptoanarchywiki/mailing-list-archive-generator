My first knowledge of Chobetsu came from noted intelligence expert Jeffery
Richelson's book on intelligence agencies. Also, as I noted some months
back, various Web sources cite it. As to the spelling, I'm using
Richelson's. He cites Chobetsu's role in various NSA-like activities.

(And I recall Seymour Hersh, in "Shootdown," describing some of the SIGINT
and COMINT functions of this and other agencies.)

My strong suspicion is that Japanese journalists and source are NOT the
best place to learn about Japanese SIGINT and COMINT capabilities. Not hard
to see some reasons for this.

Aside from these issues of whether they're as organized as you think I
think they are, all that matters is how quickly they yanked the RSA chip
after Bidzos held it up before Congress.

Oh, OK. I'll "engage" and not just write Japan off.

Please notify me, and us, of the forums where these engagements are
occurring. For starters, how about some e-mail addresses of cabinet
ministers and other officials.

This discussion is hardly going down in flames. You're apparently too
sensitive to engage in robust debate.

Frankly, I've seen no mentions in the American press, let alone the
Japanese press, about how Japan caved in to U.S. pressures. (There may have
been some minor mentions in the U.S. press, but they had little impact.)

So, Joichi, why don't you stir the shit on this one? And I don't mean with
"constructive engagement." That's a synonym for inaction.

Point out to your Japanese readers the nefarious role the NSA is playing,
the role of the U.S. spy facilities in Misakawa Air Force Base, where the
NSA and its military liason offices, intercept the communications of
Toshiba, Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, and so on and feed them, selectively, to
U.S. COMINT consumers. (Why Japan and Germany allow U.S. SIGINT facilities
in their own territory is a mystery to me...must be some nice payoffs to
senior officials.)

Declare war on the NSA. You've several times trumpetted the Japanese
Constitution as supporting basic rights even more than the Amerikan
Constitution does, so this is your chance to say "Fuck the National
Security State."

Get the RSA chip released widely and quickly. The drug trade in Asia could
use it right now.

(No, this is not a joke. I favor full availability of any and all drugs to
anyone who wants them. This makes the Triads and Yakuza allies in defeating
the New World Order. The ComSec 3DES phones are a step in defeating the
DEA, Interpol, and other police state agencies, but the RSA chip would make
a lot of such things much more interesting.)
