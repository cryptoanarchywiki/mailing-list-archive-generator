I recall reading "The book of lists" by Wallechinski/Wallace (sorry, I
threw it out and no longer have the exact reference).  One of the categories
was "10 biggest U.S. media deceptions".  Wallace claimed that the Hearst
organization manufactured the news of the artificial famine in the 1930s
and used the pictures from the tzarist era famines.
