It has just about all the earmarks of snakeoil.
It's got:
"breakthrough"
all sorts of nifty acronyms

you of course can't get the source code
it's going to "revolutionize" cryptography... 
.... yawn ....
Remember Elementrix?

"In fact, Bill Gates and several of his competitors have been personally
challenged to validate or discredit these claims. "

I'll go one better than that! "Bill - you and your buddies all give me
$1,000,000"
I think I'll cut a press release right now ...
