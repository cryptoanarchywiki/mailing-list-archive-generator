The 26 November Guardian reports on the bungled case
of the UK hacker who allegedly threatened US national
security by hacking the Rome AFB system (and scaring the
bejesus out of the North Koreans to boot) while searching
for Area 51 info on aliens. 

The case was thrown out by the court as way overblown
and unproveable, though the USG got a lot of mileage from
it for "terrorist threats."

It hoots at the USAF's crack cyber-security team in San 
Antonio who over-mobilized to trace the terrifying teenager
by most sophisticated means, not knowing that the kid had 
already been nabbed by Scotland Yard thanks to a 
traditional-means informant.

Now the officer who led the AF hunt is working the cyber-scare
circuit peddling the top gun technology -- top secret of course,
can't even be revealed by court order.
