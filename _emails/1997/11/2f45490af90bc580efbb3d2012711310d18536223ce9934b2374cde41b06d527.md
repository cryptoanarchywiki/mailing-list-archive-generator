The statement from Colorado Senator Charles Duke on the "10th Amendment
Sovereignty Resolution" was the first I'd heard of it, so I wasn't aware
that it was limited to a vision of smaller States over Larger States.   I,
too, would prefer a showdown for a recognition of  Individual Sovereignty,
distant as such a thing may seem in possibility.   Only science fiction
authors and readers seem to be able to identify individuality out of a mass
of "social factors".
