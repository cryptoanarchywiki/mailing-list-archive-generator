But the basis of using the Navajo code talkers was classic "security
through obscurity." The U.S. was expecting, quite reasonably, that the
Japanese side would not have any Navajo speakers available (nor that they
Japanese would even figure out _what_ the language was).

The jig is up on using Navajo code talkers, so this particular role is now
history.

And modern crypto doesn't need this kind of code talking.

Finally, there are a couple of Navajo lexicons and dictionaries now
available, so the government has obviously not classified Navajo
scholarship...nor could it.
