Should anyone attend the BXA meeting in DC referenced below, 
we'd be grateful for a report, handouts and minutes, especially 
on encryption regulation and implementation of the Wassenaar 
Arrangement -- whose issuance is now overdue.

A "Wassenaar Plenary" is scheduled for sometime in December 
as well, with a "Wassenaar list review" in May 1998, according 
to minutes of the October 21 meeting of the Information Systems 
Technical Advisory Committee:

12958, dealing with the U.S. export control program and strategic 
criteria related thereto.

    The General Session of the meeting will be open to the public and a 
limited number of seats will be available. To the extent that time 
permits, members of the public may present oral statements to the 
Committee. Written statements may be submitted at any time before or

presentation materials to the Committee members, the Committee suggests 
that presenters forward the public presentation materials two weeks 
prior to the meeting date to the following address: Ms. Lee Ann 
Carpenter, OAS/EA/BXA MS: 3886C, 14th & Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., 
U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230.

    The Assistant Secretary for Administration, with the concurrence of 
the delegate of the General Counsel, formally determined on December
