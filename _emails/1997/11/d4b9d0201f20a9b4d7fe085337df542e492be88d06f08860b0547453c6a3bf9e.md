 Just so.

Hettinga seems to think I am criminally liable in case some terrorist
decides to spend $10 million or so (the going rate, I hear) to buy a nuke
so that he can make me happy in my, Hettinga claims, "will no one rid me of
this city of pesitlence and vermin" entreaties.

"As if." (to quote the GenXers)

While I believe the odds are increasing that a nuclear or biological weapon
will be used against the centers of oppression--Washington, New York, Tel
Aviv, etc.--I certainly can't imagine any self-respecting member of Abu
Nidal's team, for example, spending this kind of bread just to make Tim May
happy.

But people like Hettinga and Crispin believe in guilt by viewpoint, and in
keeping quiet so as not to make the authorities mad.

Me, my actions have been to move away from "soft targets." Even in a major
nukewar with the Evil Empire, I'm 30 miles _south_ of the major targets in
Silicon Valley, like the Satellite Operations Center at Onizuka/Moffet in
Sunnyvale and Mountain View. (The famed "Blue Cube.") The Blue Cube is now
mirrored at Falcon AFB in Colorado, and may by now even be the main site
for satellite tracking.

Hint: Given the prevailing winds and jet stream in this part of the world,
and given the mountain range between my location and Silicon Valley, I'm
almost certainly completely safe. Except from the aftereffects of a
nukewar, namely, human vermin spreading out through the mountain passes
trying to steal what they can. Hence my "other measures."

A bio weapon is more troublesome, where I am, but I doubt any CBW agent
could have toxicity to cover even those of us in fairly isolated ocean
valleys.

I expect one day to hear that some major world capital has been nuked or
devastated with botulinin toxin. I doubt I'll be crying.

(Hettinga plans to call the cops because of this comment.)
