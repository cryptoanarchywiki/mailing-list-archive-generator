What do you want proven? That the second ammendment is absolute? Even if 
one does not believe that (I personally do from a simple libertarian 
point of view rather than that of a constitutionalist) then surely the 
level of infringement of 2nd ammendment rights currently seen must 
indicate to you a validity of the statement "Congress either doesn`t 
understand or ignores the constitution".

We really don`t need a "law count", more new laws are passed than old 
ones are repealed or fall into disuse. Therefore there is an increasing 
law count, of course a lot of laws have counter-laws that contradict them 
but this does not reduce the law count, infact it effectively increases 
it by making there a larger number of things for which one can be 
convicted of breaking the law.
