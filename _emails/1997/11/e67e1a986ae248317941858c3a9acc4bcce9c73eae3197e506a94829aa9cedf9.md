Paul Pomes was complaining about Jeff Burchell's huge cajones remailer to Jeff
Burchell's upstream and employers about the same time the rest of the Databasix
gang was doing it.  Paul Pomes appears to be a part of the Databasix gang.

Gary Burnore had a mongo page at http://www.netscum.net/burnorg0.html.
So did Paul Pomes, Belinda Bryan, and the rest of the Databasix gang.
Too bad it's down for now, but it'll be back.
