I agree.  This has always been my reaction to the infowar
folks--anyone who understands how to attack a system can
look around and find hundreds of fairly easy targets.  Some
of these targets just *can't* be protected in a
cost-effective way.  (Note the way the IRA and various
Palestinian terrorists still manage to find soft targets,
despite the fact that their intended victims have spent
years and millions of dollars hardening the obvious soft
points.)

Of course.  Any moron with a hammer can ruin a car engine;
it takes a skilled mechanic to fix one.  The same applies
almost everywhere--destroying something takes a fraction of
the skill of building or maintaining it.
