Someone sent this to me privately. I don't know why he didn't cc: the list.
But I'll respect his apparent wishes and excise any clues as to who he is.

Yes! This was it! This was what I saw. Some crazy "Einstein Male PenPals"
stuff.

I have no idea why I couldn't find it again...must've used a slightly
different search engine, with a slightly different set of reachable nodes.

Here's the entry for "Nobuki Nakatuji":

My hobbies are playing guitar and listening music.
Nobuki Nakatuji <nn1332@galaxynet.or.jp>

Is this the same Nobuki Nakatuji asking for money  for descriptions of
crypto programs? ("What am Misty?"..."You send money, I send description")
