kiwi is NOT refusing connections.  It is just not there.  There's 
a difference.

The host:

	http://kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu/

does not respond to connection requests to port 80, nor 8080, nor 8001.

Ping yields "Host lookup failed - Non-authoritative host not found."

The browser indicates it is trying to contact, which can mean anything
up to and including that it is awaiting a cascading name lookup, but 
has not yet opened a TCP connection to the target. I'm guessing kiwi 
is Raph's computer in Computer Science and that maybe it is hosed. 
Maybe Raph has been hosed... 

    "(WHAP!) Tell us the name of your leader! (WHAP!) Talk! (WHAP!)" 

Maybe Raph will turn up one of these days writing plaintive 
notes of contrition. Maybe... oh, never mind.

Oddly, while Raph has a home page at www.cs.berkeley.edu and 
at atropos.c2.net/, all the critical roads seem to lead to kiwi, 
including the mixmaster list. Search engines show precious few references to critical remailer files except in the links that 
point to the dead host. Is it really this easy to make the whole
remailer network go stale -- like cutting off jet fighter spare 
parts to suddenly unfriendly nation-states?

Wouldn't it be prudent to mirror the remailer lists, keys and 
stats at a few dozen places scattered around the world? Would
it take more than a few percent of the effort and time that have
recently been pissed down a hole writing and reading the flames
that have consumed the list of late? Hmmmm?
