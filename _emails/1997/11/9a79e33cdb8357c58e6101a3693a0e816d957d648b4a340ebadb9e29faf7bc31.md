News report Nov 7, 97:

AT&T, Hewlett Packard, Intel Corporation, Dell Computers, and 
many other leading computer corporations have been added to the 
challenge list by Meganet Corporation. The challenge started 
last week with Bill Gates, now some of his peers have an opportunity 
to validate or discredit the bold claim that Meganet's VME 
(Virtual Matrix Encryption) is totally unbreakable. 

Unbreakable encryption is the only answer to security 
in our electronic world. This is graphically illustrated 
by the recent report from the National Security Agency
reporting the open market availability of a $10 chip that 
can test up to 200 million keys per second. The 56-bit key, 
government and banking standard, can be compromised in 
twelve (12) seconds with brute force using ASIC
(Application-specific Integrated Circuits) chips. 

Meganet has the answer with its new VME (Virtual Matrix 
Encryption). The impenetrable VME also has extreme speed, 
much faster than any existing program available today. 

Major computer companies are already starting discussions 
to acquire the rights to market this incredible new data 
encryption system. More information about this
exciting new technology can be found at: www.meganet.com

----------

Hmm, wonder if it has impenetrable GAK and CAK options.
