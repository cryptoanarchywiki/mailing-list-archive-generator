"Microsoft and Netscape insist that the W3C does produce truly open
standards, and that it's the only way to make sure the Web doesn't
dissolve into chaos."

  The W3C is also producing a "single point of failure" so that 
hackers will be able to concentrate their energies on gaining access
to *everything*.

Chaos==Anarchy==Freedom
