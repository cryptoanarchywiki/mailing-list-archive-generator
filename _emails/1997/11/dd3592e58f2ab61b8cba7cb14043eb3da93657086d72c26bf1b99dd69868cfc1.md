They are they same if we ignore the fact that there is 50+ years between
the 1st (1700-1750) and the 2nd (1800-1850).

Then you should go back and read them some more. In fact, if you still have
the originals they include in the header the URL where I got the data from.
Take the 10 minutes and go over and take a look at them. All three were
related to religous revivalism in one form or another. The 1st (which
itself some consider to be the second occurance of a previous movement
as indicated in the title) did not occur in the 1800's which was the
original precis that somebody threw out

I did some looking around as well and other then Norton, yourself, and
whoever it was that made the original claim all references I can find to
the Great Awakening refer to the 1700-1750 event(s) as the first one to
occur in the America's. If I can find my Norton Anthology I'll take a
look at it, though it is 15+ years old.
