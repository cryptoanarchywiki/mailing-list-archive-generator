In the case where:
1) Your entropy source is as good as you think it is
2) Your opponent knows nothing about the data from your entropy source
and
3) Your entropy mixes the way you expect it to.

this is indeed the case.

If you're not completely sure about the above, using a cryptographic
hash requires your hypothetical opponent to be able to reverse the hash
to exploit what they know, rather than simpler computations.

Since it seems that paranoia pays off in the design of cryptographic
software, I'd recommend always using a strong hash.
