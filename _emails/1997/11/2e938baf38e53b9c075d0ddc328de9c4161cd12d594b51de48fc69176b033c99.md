Members of abused minority groups should be pretty much in sync with a
lot of concerns held by cypherpunks.  When we talk about police
brutality and concentration camps, most of us, as well as our friends
and relatives, have little direct experience.  This is not true of
many members of minority groups.

Sounds like a nice project.  Good luck!

If we do our job properly, the cypherpunk public image won't
matter. ;-)

White males are a minority group.  Also, I believe you are
overestimating the effects of racism when it comes to hiring talented
technical professionals.  If not, there is a tremondous arbitrage
opportunity out there.
