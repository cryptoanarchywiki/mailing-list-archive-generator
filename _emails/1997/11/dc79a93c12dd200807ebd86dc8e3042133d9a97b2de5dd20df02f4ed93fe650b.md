    yeah, well, my old lady just told me that (having been born in
    in the same small town as John Brown) John Brown's younger sister
    was my great-great-great-grandmother...

    I guess that gives me the right to express the thought that 
    anybody pushed far enough into the corner will behave like
    any other cornered animal --and some of us will just react
    a little sooner... and a great deal nastier.

    I never picked a fight, but I have more than finished a few.

    remember:  revenge is best served up cold.

        attila out...
