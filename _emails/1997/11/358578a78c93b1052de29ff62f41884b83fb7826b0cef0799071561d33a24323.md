This illustrates what a liability the poster has become to the cypherpunks.
The group is becoming just another militia front, identified with racism
and white supremacy, applauding violent murder of government agents,
one step from applauding the Oklahoma killings.  Its original purpose
all but forgotten, the list has died, poisoned by the hatred flowing from
its leader.
