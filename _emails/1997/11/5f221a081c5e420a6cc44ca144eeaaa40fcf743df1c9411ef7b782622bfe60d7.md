No, it only proves Monty doesn't believe what he says.

To hell with gassing them, the issue is the bar-b-que that occurred after.

Something like 18 children were murdered and the US government and the
then Texas (bitch) govenor Ann Richards were complicent in the nefarious
deed. Someday she and every agent that participated will stand before a jury,
unfortunately the odds are it will be the jury of history and not their
peers.

Why were those kids deprived of the modern conveniences? Clearly the answer
"David and his followers wouldn't surrender" doesn't hold water. Those kids
deserve NO punishment for actions others *may* have committed, they were a
victim - whether of David or the actions of the gov. reps. is irrellevant.

Those people were given a public trust, they not only abused it but failed
miserably in its resolution. They must pay the price. Saying "I was
following orders" has no place in a democratic society anywhere; the
individual MUST be held accountable for their actions and they should not be
able to shirk that responsibility nor pass it off to some 3rd party.
Further, irrispective of their job or position in society or the government
the responsibilities AND rights of the individual must not be infringed AND
must take predidence over all other duties or responsibilties.
