Hotel Accommodations:  There are two hotels that have agreed to offer, on a
space-available basis, rooms at the government rate ($108/single;
128/double).  However, you must advise the hotel when making arrangements
that you are a State Department invitee and that the government rate should
be applied.  They, in turn, will contact the L/PIL to verify
