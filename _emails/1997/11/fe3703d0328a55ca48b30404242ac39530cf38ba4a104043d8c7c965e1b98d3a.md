* The University of Minnesota was seeking more "specialists" to
work on its three-year, $390,000 program to set an "odor emissions
rating system" for regulating the state's 35,000 animal feedlots,
according to an August Minneapolis Star Tribune story.  Having
judges, or government officials, go sniff the feedlot apparently
would give insufficient due process of law; rather, a panel of
sniffers will develop objective standards on the types of odors and
their strength.  Already 35 people are employed and have begun
sniffing the nearly-200 chemical components of cow and pig
manure in order to categorize them for the formal state stench test.
