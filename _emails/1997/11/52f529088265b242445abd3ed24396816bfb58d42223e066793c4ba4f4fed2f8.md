 No that was not the point made, in fact the show made a strong point in 
favor of the first amendment. They went after the shock-jock because he 
specifically incited a specific individiual with words which we he knew 
would have an immediate cause and effect result in getting this guy to go 
out and kill someone. There is a difference, and I personally thought 
they made the point well .... now the accused did try to hide behind the 
first amendment but that was not what the first amendment is all about.

  You have to pick yopur mountains to die on in those arenas and the 
shock-jocks cause would not have been one I would have touched were I a 
Constitutional lawyer.
