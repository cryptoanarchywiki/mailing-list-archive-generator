So, just as a question, what COULD the FBI do,
if it saw a real possibility for organized crime
to get out of control if they no longer could do
wiretaps?  I have a friend in berlin who says
the Russian Mob is moving in there.  Scary.

What should the FBI say?  Is there even a 
Constitutional option?
