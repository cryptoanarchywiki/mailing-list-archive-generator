>From News of the CypherPunks:

* In March, a 36-year-old man choked to death on a 6-inch tropical
fish he had popped into his mouth while showing off for friends in
Bayou Vista, La.  And in April, a 12-year-old boy was electrocuted
in East Palo Alto, Calif., after he climbed a high-voltage
transmission tower in the rain, dared his three companions to join
him, and then accidentally touched a wire.  And in July, a 22-year-
old man, described by his grandmother as "smart in school," died in
a bungee-cord accident on a railroad trestle in Fairfax County, Va. 
(Said a police spokesman:  "The length of the cord that he had
assembled was greater than the distance between the trestle and the
ground.")
