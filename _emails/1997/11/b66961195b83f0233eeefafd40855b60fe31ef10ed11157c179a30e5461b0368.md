Absolutely not. It crashed mine and is a major bug. It doesn't seem to
affect the PPro, though, and not the P2 due to its relation to the PPro. It
might be fixed in later Pentiums, which begs the question of why Intel
didn't issue a recall back then. Supposidly they were informed about it
months ago.

Read comp.sys.intel.
