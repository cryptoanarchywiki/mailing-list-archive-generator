Uk News:

Judge David Selwood today sentenced 3 writers for the magazine "Green 
Anarchist" to 3 years imprisonment each for their articles in the 
magazine which he concluded incited others to break the law.
The magazine contained diaries for the previous months animal rights 
activism events and contained articles generally favourable to the cause 
of animal liberation.

Another judge who has richly earned the death penalty.
