Silence doesn't necessarily denote agreement, especially from someone (for
example, me :) who avoids political posts altogether... 

============================================================================

That stylometry thing (figuring out who wrote a message from its content) 
seems to be a big problem for people using remailers. Initially, I thought you
could avoid it by using some software to tinker with your words. Although that
can confuse some attacks, there are still author-dependent things you can't
hide so easily. For example, someone with a sufficiently big sample of your
writing (i.e., all a nym's public traffic) could measure, say, the number words
per sentence, or how likely you are to use certain punctuation/function words,
and use that to match it to something you wrote under your own name. And the
measurement part isn't rocket science, either -- I slapped together a simple
stylometer from basic UNIX tools (sed, sort, uniq, grep) and a calculator, and
it appears to actually _work_.

(In addition to being able to say two messages are by the same person, it looks
like you can also tell a little bit about the author, but as for how much and
what...?)
