The SFPD _was_ arresting several hundred people that night
and impounding their bicycles for what might normally have been
traffic tickets, though many of the arrests were for "failure to disperse" --
Mayor Willie Brown had been taking enough PR heat for the Critical Mass
bicycle rides, and decided he had to "do something".
All but a few of the arrestees were out in a few hours,
with at most traffic tickets, and got their bikes back the next day
(the city DA had to keep reminding Da Mayor that he couldn't legally
just confiscate them.)

I wasn't on the same block as Burnore, so I don't know if he was being
personally obnoxious when he got busted, or was one of the many
who were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
(Not that Critical Mass isn't somewhat confrontational :-)
				Thanks!
