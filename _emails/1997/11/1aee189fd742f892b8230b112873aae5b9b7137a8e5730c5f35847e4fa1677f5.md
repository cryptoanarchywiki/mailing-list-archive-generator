>Dear Colleagues,
>
>Electronic Commerce is a rapidly growing area with global economic
>implications.  I'm excited to be able to say that we're putting
>together the Third USENIX Workshop on Electronic Commerce, and I
>invite your participation.  This vital inter-disciplinary field
>thrives from a cross pollenation of ideas and techniques from many
>areas, and this workshop will be a great opportunity for you to
>present your findings as well as learn about other latest results.
>
>So, mark your calendars!  The workshop will take place from August 31
>to September 3, 1998, and paper submissions are due by March 6, 1998.
>I hope to see you in Boston!

>OVERVIEW
>
>The Third Workshop on Electronic Commerce will provide a major
>opportunity for researchers, experimenters, and practitioners in
>this rapidly self-defining field to exchange ideas and present the
>results of their work. It will set the technical agenda for work in
>electronic commerce by enabling workers to examine urgent
>questions, share their insights and discover connections with other
>work that might otherwise go unnoticed. To facilitate this, the
>conference will not be limited to technical problems and solutions,
>but will also consider their context: the economic and regulatory
>forces that influence the engineering choices we make, and the
>social and economic impact of network based trading systems.
>
>
>TUTORIALS PROPOSALS WELCOME
>
>One day of tutorials will precede the Workshop on August 31.
>USENIX's well-respected tutorials are intensive and provide
>immediately-useful information delivered by skilled instructors who
>are hands-on experts in their topic areas. Topics for the
>Electronic Commerce Workshop will include, but are not limited to,
>security and cryptography. If you are interested in presenting a
>tutorial, please contact:

>
>
>WHAT TO SUBMIT
>
>Technical paper submissions and proposals for panels must be
>received by March 6, 1998. We welcome submissions of the following
>type:
>
>1. Refereed Papers - Full papers or extended abstracts should be five
>   to 20 pages, not counting references and figures.
>
>2. Panel proposals - Proposals should be three to seven pages,
>   together with a list of names of potential panelists. If
>   accepted, the proposer must secure the participation of
>   panelists, and prepare a three to seven page summary of panel
>   issues for inclusion in the Proceedings. This summary can
>   include position statements by panel participants.
>
>3. Work-In-Progress Reports - Short, pithy, and fun, WIP reports
>   introduce interesting new or ongoing work and should be 1 to 3
>   pages in length. If you have work you would like to share or a
>   cool idea that is not quite ready to publish, a WIP is for you!
>   We are particularly interested in presenting student work.
>
>Each submission must include a cover letter stating the paper title
>and authors, along with the name of the person who will act as the
>contact to the program committee. Please include a surface mail
>address, daytime and evening phone number, email and fax numbers
>and, if available, a URL for each author. If all of the authors are
>students, please indicate that in the cover letter for award
>consideration (see "Awards" below).
>
>USENIX workshops, like most conferences and journals, require that
>papers not be submitted simultaneously to more than one conference
>or publication and that submitted papers not be previously or
>subsequently published elsewhere. Submissions accompanied by
>non-disclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be
>returned to the author(s) unread. All submissions are held in the
>highest confidentiality prior to publication in the Proceedings,
>both as a matter of policy and in accord with the U.S. Copyright
>Act of 1976.
>
>
>WHERE TO SUBMIT PROPOSALS
>
>Please send submissions to the program committee via one of the
>following methods. All submissions will be acknowledged.
>
>Preferred Method: email (Postscript or PDF formats only) to:
>ec98papers@usenix.org.
>
>Files should be encoded for transport with uuencode or MIME base64
>encoding.  Authors should ensure that the PostScript is generic and
>portable so that their papers will print on a broad range of
>postscript printers, and should submit in sufficient time to allow
>us to contact the author about alternative delivery mechanisms in
>the event of network or other failure. If you send PostScript,
>remember the following:
>
>1) Use only the most basic fonts (TimesRoman, Helvetica, Courier).
>   Other fonts are not available with every printer or previewer.
>
>2) PostScript that requires some special prolog to be loaded into
>   the printer won't work for us. Please don't send it.
>
>3) If you use a PC- or Macintosh-based word processor to generate
>   your PostScript, print it on a generic PostScript printer before
>   sending it, to make absolutely sure that the PostScript is
>   portable.
>
>4) If you are generating the PostScript from a program running
>   under Windows, make sure that you establish the "portable"
>   setting, not the "speed" setting for PostScript generation.
>
>A good heuristic is to make sure that recent versions of Ghostview
>(e.g. Ghostview 1.5 using Ghostscript 3.33) can display your
>paper.
>
>Alternate Method: 10 copies, via postal delivery to:
>
>EC'98 Submissions
>USENIX Association
>2560 Ninth Street, Suite 215
>Berkeley, CA 94710
>
>For detailed submission guidelines, send email to ec98authors@usenix.org,
>refer to the conference Web page at
>www.usenix.org/events/ec98/guidelines.html,
>or send email to the program chair at ec98chair@usenix.org.  An
>electronic version of this Call for Papers is available at:
>www.usenix.org/events/ec98/.
>
>
>BIRDS-OF-A-FEATHER SESSIONS (BoFs)
>
>Do you have a topic that you'd like to discuss with others? Our
>Birds-of-a-Feather Sessions may be perfect for you. BoFs are very
>interactive and informal gatherings for attendees interested in a
>particular topic. Schedule your BoF in advance by telephoning the
>USENIX Conference Office at 714.588.8649 or sending email to:
>conference@usenix.org.
>
>

>and the best student paper.
>
>

>
>Materials containing all details of the technical and tutorial
>programs, registration fees and forms and hotel information will be
>available in June, 1998. If you wish to receive the registration
>materials, please contact USENIX at:
