Napolean never took Moscow, he was stopped - just like Hitler - at the
gates. The closest either French or German forces got was to look at the
spires of the Kremlin. Beyond that similarity there are a wide range of
differences between the situation. The fact remains that had Stalin *not*
been able to withdraw troops from the Chinese border he would not have been
able to keep Stalingrad or Moscow. Further, the *only* reason that Stalin
could afford to do that was because Sorge indicated that the Japanese were
interested in other goals at the time. Oh, regarding Napolean, the reason
that he couldn't take Moscow was because troops, called Cossacks, were moved
from the east to the west.

Hitler may have been a lot of things, stupid was not one of them.

Such as? The situation in China at the time was that a variety of warlords
were spending more time fighting each other than the Japanese. China at that
time was not a cohesive entity. The reason that Japan lost WWII was that at
no point did they have strategic supplies of oil for longer than 5-9 months
*and* the US waged unrestricted submarine warfare in the Pacific destroying
what merchant marine the Japanese had so they could not take advantage of
the oil refineries in such nifty places as Palembang, Sumatra (whose taking
in Feb. 1942 was the first use of Japanese paratroops, all 700 were wiped
out). It was not because they didn't have the men.

In 1934 Mussolini invaded Abyssinia all on his own, Hitler took the
opportunity to march into the Rhineland while the rest of the world stood
aghast at the use of modern weapons against stone-age tribesmen. The next
thing Mussolini did was send troops to help Franco, troops which fought
right along side Germans troops. On Nov. 30, 1938 Ciano made a comment in
the Fascist Chamber about 'natural aspiration' and the members stood yelling
"Corsica, Tunis, Nice!". The talk of taking Nice obviously did nothing to 
settle the French's worries. In July, 1938 5 billion lire was asigned to
modernize the Italian forces. The Abyssinian campaign cost 13 billion lire
and tied up 300,000 Italian troops. The help in Spain cost hardware and
involved another 50,000 troops who were still there. When the Spanish Civil
War ended in 1939 he invaded Albania, which was an Italian protectorate. By
this time Italy as allied strongly to Germany in the minds of just about
everyone. Around 12 August, 1939 after Ciano discovered the intended invasion
of Poland and passed this to Mussolini did there become a measure of doubt in
Mussolini's mind that perhaps he had picked the wrong allies.

If the US had waited until Hitler began dropping bombs on New York and
firing V2's from submarines 20 miles off the coast while at the same time
Japan was doing the same sorts of things, with a nice base at Pearl Harbor,
*and* you claim the US could have stood the test then I can only say you
are confused at best.
