This is the first story in a very funny little book called _Politically Correct
Bedtime Stories: Modern Tales for Our Life & Times_ by james Finn Garner,
Macmillann, ISBN 0-02-542730-X, *** (C) 1994 by James Finn Garner ***.

I also have his _Once Upon a More Enlightened Time: More Politically Correct
Bedtime Stories_, Macmillan, ISBN 0-02-860419-9.  Both highly recommended.
