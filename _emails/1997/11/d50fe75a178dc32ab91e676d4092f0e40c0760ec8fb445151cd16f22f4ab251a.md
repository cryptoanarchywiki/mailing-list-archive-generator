  Yeah...you got a problem with that?

  And if I _don't_?
 
>   2. have you placed your pgp5.x key on the public keyservers?

  Yeah. They sent it back and told me to fuck off.

>   3. Were you using an earlier version of pgp before getting pgp5.x

  6.0. I'm from the future.

  Hey, pal. Quit ordering me around!
 
> 4. Is your pgp2.x (or 4.x) key on a public key server

  Yes,  but it's under _your_ name.

  I put it on using their root account. They need better security

> 6. How many people do you communicate with using PGP?

  None, really. I usually just babble incoherently.

> 7. Of those how many are using pgp2.x (or pgp4.x)

  None. Do you think that is maybe why no one ever replies?

> 8. and how many are using pgp5.x

  How the fuck would I know if they never write (Adam) back?

  Like, I'm _sleeping_ with everyone I write to? How long till I
get to the 'smart' questions?

> 10. How many of the people who use pgp2.x (answer to 7) are

  Only the guy in the next cell.

  Only the ones promoting it in anonymous posts to the list.

  That's more apprecitation than the Warden ever expressed.
