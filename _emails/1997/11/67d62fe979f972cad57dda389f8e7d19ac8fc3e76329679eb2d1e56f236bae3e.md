  Did anyone check out the Heaven's Gate group's computer work? I doubt
that many of their customers would not welcome a chance to have them
back on board. I've worked in plenty of environments where people had
vastly different religious, social, racial and political beliefs, and
most people don't (and shouldn't) give a rat's ass as long as they
pull their weight.
  Of course, if enough people complain and picket, or whatever, then
a 'cult' or a 'racist' or a 'sexist' can become a business liability,
not due to the quality of their work, or their unfitness for the job,
but because of the hateful intolerance of those with the 'right'
beliefs.

  Want to experience hateful intolerance? Read your Bible and believe
that it states the races should remain separate. You will soon be
pointed out as a person who 'hates niggers' and burns crosses on
their lawn, etc, etc, ad infinitum.
  Why? Because those being hatefully intolerant have the 'right'
beliefs as to what the Bible says. 
(Am I a racist if I don't also include an example from the Koran?)

  The fact that different nations, races and idealists are busy 
slaughtering one another during various wars never seems to interfere
with the balance sheets of the movers and shakers in the financial
world. Many of our Presidents since World War II were elected as
a result of the proceeds of their family or friends' ill-gotten
war gains from supporting the war machines that their own children
were fighting against.

  Little BillyG isn't going to go hungry tonight just because he's
snake-bit, onery and mean.
