Do you have any idea which ISPs may be doing that?  What's their rationale?
This is the first I'd heard of such a practice.  Are they blocking all
posts from all mail2news gateways or just yours?  To all NGs, or just to 
alt.test?

Also, there seems to be one censorious nutcase out there who seems to think
he's on a mission from God to "despam" alt.test!  I don't know who the heck
thinks a *TEST* NG needs his brand of "ethnic" cleansing, but just look at
all the cancel messages in the "control" NG for posts to alt.test.
