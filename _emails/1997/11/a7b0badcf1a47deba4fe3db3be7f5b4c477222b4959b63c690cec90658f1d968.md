on or about 971111:1833, in <1.5.4.32.19971111233358.00a03ac8@pop.pipeline.com>, 
    John Young <jya@pipeline.com> was purported to have 
    expostulated to perpetuate an opinion:

    the beast, John, remember the beast...

    yes, Bob, go to end, before I inflame you even more.
    that goes for the candy-ass left-wing Hallam-Baker, too.

    known fact, wipe 'em out one by one, including their pets.

    govt. instigation, to validate their need for more 
    suppressive laws on speech and firearms.

      "And the Clinton administration launched an attack
        on people in Texas because those people were
        religious nuts with guns.
       Hell, this country was founded by religious nuts 
        with guns." 
            --P.J.  O'Rourke.

    Ditto, Oklahoma City. classic case of burying the evidence, 
    literally.

>True, firebombing works, as does mass weaponing --nukes,

    the zealot does not care. there has never been mercy in
    war, but only the losers stood for "war crimes" --until
    Lt. Calley.

    real easy for the candystripers to send troops they've
    never seen to their deaths --they're just numbers and 
    statistics. the 30 day wonder boy 2nd lieutenant has a
    better than 50% chance of dying with a bullet in his
    back.

    then they send the more blatant and visible ones to
    spec-ops where we can all get down to some serious killing.

    look the killer in the eye --tap him upside the head to
    see if the light is still on, and you can read the writing
    on the back wall of the cranium. reality check.

    I'll take 500 more of those over 50,000 Marines, thank you.

>fucking terrifying to do yourself directly.

    patience, John, patience... let them give the fucking orders,
    then just go and do the job right.  

    dont worry, the strutting bastards will claim the credit for
    your kill anyway.

    yup, wait until he moves into position, thinking he has his
    way, then put that boot on his gonads all the way to his 
    throat.  patience, patience, kill.

        then toss your calling card on the scene.

>Go home, get a beer, stare the tube, sharpen your tool. Or as
>maddog Tim sez, lock and load.

    I doubt Tim has his tools visible --just handy.

>But look, I'm with Bob, too, my tool's philosophy gone berzerk,

    sure hate to be that maddog neighbor if he rubbed on you, 
    John.  who you kidding?

>Sure glad my war's long over, happily getting dimmer, easier to forget the
>godawful. Hey, it's veteran's day, anybody want to croak and limp  to glories
>past?

    remember 1964.

    my uncle was 40 when he reupped Marines NCO for WWII; he was
    50 when he tried to reup Marines for Korea--they wouldn't
    let him go Marines, but he did go to Inchon as a Navy 
    Seabee...

    in 1950, and even at the beginning of the 60s we thought we
    were doing our duty for God and for country --wrong.
    
    no, and I aint goin' to shut up with those bastards from
    Washington disgracing themselves and pissing away our 
    heritage in the New World Order bullshit --it's them same
    old stories of rape, pillage, and burn by the privileged 
    class --redistribution of wealth, disenfranchise the
    rest of us...  

    nothing new in history; read Catulus or Marcellus from 2,000 
    years ago.

    to the victor goes the spoils? not necessarily.

        to the victor goes the right to [re]write history.

    which is why crypto freedom is our freedom.
