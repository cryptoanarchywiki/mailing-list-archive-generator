Yep, except I plan to be at home, in my compound, with a several-month
supply of food. (I'm on a well, and I have a generator, so a loss of the
grid in the ensuing chaos would not devastate me. Plus, central California
has a pretty mild climate...)

The dumbest thing to do is to pay big bucks, as many are, to be in some
exotic location to celebrate the rollover of the digits (if not the
century, as we all know). Imagine being stranded in Cairo or Machu Piccu
during this meltdown.

The consensus in the survivalist community is that the Y2K problem will
devastate the IRS system, exactly as Jim describes here (and as we
discussed on the list a couple of months ago, mid-September, under the
thread title, "Preparing the Remnant for the far side of the crisis"). Too
many interdependencies, too much old code, not enough time or money to make
the changes, and probably not even enough knowledge about how to go about
it.

All it will take are a few systems failing. Checks arriving late, systems
crashing, a slowdown in an already slow system. (And of course the common
workarounds, such as keeping the computer clock set at 1998 or 1999, will
not work, as many benefits and IRS programs have dependencies on the clock
year, on the ages of taxpayers, on previous year's payments, and on and on.)

The loss of confidence in a highly-automated--but nevertheless
creaky--system will be glorious to watch.

You need to see the _bright side_ of the problem! By undermining the
system,  the changes that are needed will come sooner.

And I think the theory that tax protestors have been sabotaging the system
for decades is probably on target. Obfuscating the code, destroying source
code, inserting logic bombs.

Just remember three words:

Lock and load.
