wow, I have been thinking that netscape/microsoft would put
something like this in their browser and that this would
kickstart the microcurrency market. however, it sounds like
someone has preempted them for the moment and
built a plugin. this is an extremely significant development
imho. I don't know how credible they are (the notice was
spam) but it's a step in the right direction, and the
creation of a whole new market I predict.

I-vendor is offering a freeware version of a software plug-in that
allows
anyone to sell digital files such as photos, programs, text based
information etc. from any web site. You don't have to be a company, you
don't have to have credit card facilities, you don't have to do anything
fancy with your web site - just convert your files, put them on your
site and wait for the monthly checks. The software works with Window 3.x
& 95 and current versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer - full
instructions for use are provided.
