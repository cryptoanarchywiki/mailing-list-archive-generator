* Maria DiGiulio and Mohamed Sead became the latest criminal
suspects not to beat around the bush when arrested.  When
DiGiulio was booked in July for robbing the Everett (Mass.) Co-op
Bank, she answered police Lt. Robert Bontempo forthrightly. 
"Occupation?" he asked.  "Bank robber," she said.  Sead, 47, was
booked for fraud last October in Toronto, Ontario (and convicted
this year).  Occupation?  "Con artist," he said. (Sead's scheme was
to deceive girlfriends that he was the now-deceased Dodi Fayed.)
