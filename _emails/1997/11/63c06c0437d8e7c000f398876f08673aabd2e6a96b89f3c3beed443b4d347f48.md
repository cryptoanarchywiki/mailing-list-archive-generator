Good work, Wayne. The New World Order spooks on the CypherPunks
mailing list are proud of you for cutting down on their work load.
Thanks for the help!

  Happy that the program gives you an opportunity to use a dead,
molested child to promote your business, Amy. Also glad that you
don't just sell cars to people who have the money to buy them.

  Good for you, Mark. That's 800 more potential customers you
can track once they reach driving age.
  A little tip for you: if you put some blood-stains on the seats
of the cars you sell during this period, you can increase your
sales 50% just through subliminal erotic excitation of your
customers.

  Met some nice young girls too, didn't you, Mark?

  Judy had the good sense to have her dealership's company logo
added to the autopsy pictures she made available to the press.
  Way to go, Judy!

  The CypherPunks Auto Dealers and Child Pornographers of America
