Yep, I get people asking me to "prove" that the "Tim May" who uses the
got.net ISP is the same "Tim May" as "tcmay@netcom.com," which got
associated with my original 1992 key generation.

I try to tell them, "I'm that same entity, whoever that is, if I can sign
messages with that key."

They somehow think the tcmay@netcom.com vs. tcmay@got.net dichotomy is
what's really important. I then ignore them.
