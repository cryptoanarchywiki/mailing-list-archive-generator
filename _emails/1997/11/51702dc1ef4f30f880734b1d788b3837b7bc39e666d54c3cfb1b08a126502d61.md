This was bizarre - what did you do to create the key and the ASCII version?
I imported the key into my PGP 5.0, and saw the double-key icon,
which says I have the private key as well as the public key,
and sure enough, it was willing to let me change the passphrase
(which was previously not set.)  

I'm not sure how comfortable I am signing a key which has the
private keys made public - so I signed it, and revoked it,
and you're welcome to the signed revocation certificate :-)

The keyserver says it accepted the certificate, but doesn't
find it when I query it for the key, but then it did that to me
earlier today, so I'm not sure if it's there or not.
(It's the server at http://www.pgp.com/keyserver/pks-lookup.cgi .)

The KeyID was 0x61C747B1 - 512-bit RSA

But hey, since I've got this bogus key around, might as well sign
something with it :-)
