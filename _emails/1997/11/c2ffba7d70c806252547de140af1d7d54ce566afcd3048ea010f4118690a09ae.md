Clearly not.  Let me rephrase what I said since it appears it was not as 
obvious as I had thought.

Those who wage war (the politicians/"kings") are rarely the slaves.  Those 
who die (the soldiers/citizens) usually are.

The soldiers and citizens are the pawns and other chessmen on the chessboard 
who are sacrificed to protect the king of their color while attempting to 
checkmate the king of the other color.  All chessmen are expendable, except 
the two kings.  When one of the kings is checkmated, the game is over.

Note: the king can be checkmated without the loss of a single chessman, 
though it is rare.  However, the possibility exists.  Think about it.
