Absolutly, I can't beleive that Mikhael is *that* clueless.

I had posted awhile back when these HTTP proxies first appeared about some
inherent security risks with using them.

The biggest problem with any proxy agent is one of trust. When one looks
at what a proxy agent does one can see the scary potentials for abuse.
Lets take the example of the Evil Proxy agent at www.nsa.gov.

Case #1

- -- User connects to Evil Proxy sending a request for it to retreive a web
page. -- Evil Proxy Logs who is connecting, time, and what web pages they
are requesting. -- Evil then retrieves the web pages and transmits them to
the user. -- Evil Proxy processes log data periodically to check for
either Bad User or Bad Web Page usage and flags such activity for the
Lea's.

Case #2

- -- User connects to Evil Proxy sending a request for it to retreive a web
page. -- Evil Proxy Logs who is connecting, time, and what web pages they
are requesting. -- Evil Proxy finds that web page in Bad Web Page list.
- -- Evil Proxy returns a forged web page to the user rather than the page
that the user requested. (imagine such a proxy being set-up to flag any
pgp.zip file requests and returning pgp_nsa_spoof.zip instead.) -- Evil
Proxy processes log data periodically to check for either Bad User or Bad
Web Page usage and flags such activity for the Lea's.

Case #3 (This is theoretical as I am not sure it is possessable with
current browsers)

- -- User connects to Evil Proxy sending a request for it to retreive a web
page. -- Evil Proxy Logs who is connecting, time, and what web pages they
are requesting. -- Evil Proxy finds that User in Bad User list.
- -- Evil Proxy returns the requested web page but also returns an extra
file which is saved to the Users HD without his knowledge (imagine storing
some kiddie porn gif's on a political opponents computer). -- Evil Proxy
processes log data periodically to check for either Bad User or Bad Web
Page usage and flags such activity for the Lea's.

A less damming case but still troublesome would be where Evil Proxy was
being run by commercial interest rather than governmental:

Case #4 (Not much different than Case #1)

- -- User connects to Evil Proxy sending a request for it to retreive a web
page. -- Evil Proxy Logs who is connecting, time, and what web pages they
are requesting. -- Evil then retrieves the web pages and transmits them to
the user. -- Evil Proxy processes log data periodically and sells it to
whomever want's it (Lea's, Spamford, GM, Microsoft, ... ect).

I think that you can see that the security of HTTP Proxies is the same for
a single E-Mail remailer. The natural evolution for these proxies is to
use chaining and encryption in the same way e-mail is processed through
remailers.

- -- Chaining of Proxies
- -- Multiple Layers of Encryption with the inner most layer being
end-to-end encryption.

HTTP proxies are good but still have a long way to go.
