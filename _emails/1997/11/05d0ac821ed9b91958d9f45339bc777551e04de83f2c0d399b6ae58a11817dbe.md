Of course, I want to make it perfectly clear that I am referring 
only to doing so as a member of a freedom-fighting organization
whose aims are fully supported by any government who might want
to prosecute me for asking a hypothetical question of this 
nature.
And, naturally, I would only be interested in those methods of
killing that would result in the deaths of only those who are
the evil enemies of any government who might want to prosecute
me for asking a hypothetical question of this nature.
