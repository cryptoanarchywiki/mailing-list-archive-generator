The University of Wisconsin Army Mathematics Research Center
bombing in 1970 also used a van full of ANFO, and devastated the building.
The bombers didn't know that there was a worker in the building
the night they blew it up, and hadn't planned to kill anybody,
unlike the daytime bombing of the OKCity building.

And he would have also hijacked the van instead of using
one traceable to him (or stolen it, if he had the skill.)
Not much brighter than the World Trade Center bombers
trying to get their deposit back.  The Wisconsin Rads
had the sense to steal the van they used.
(On the other hand, somebody saw them tearing out of town
in their getaway car at 4am.)
