*** TV station sets cybersex sting

With cyperporn and cybersex ranking as sensational news items on
local TV stations, Fox's Los Angeles outlet has taken the trend a
step further by ensnaring adult sexual predators. KTTV's Fox 11 News
at 10 worked with a 21-year-old woman posing as a 14-year-old to
conduct cybersting operations that led to the arrests of five men.
KTTV used the unnamed woman as bait, having her enter online chat
rooms where she was immediately targeted. The station filmed the
online seductions as well as the arrests of the men, who included an
attorney, a doctor, a retired Army officer and an investigator for
the Dept. of Labor. See story at
