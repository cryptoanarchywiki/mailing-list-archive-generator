Well, you got the edge on me there; I got my first when I was 12, but
my dad let me shoot his .357 Magnum when I was 7.

I recall a period of time when some punks were following me around
because I had ratted on one of their friends. I got tired of it, got a
B-27 silhouette target, and shot out the X-ring with my Para-Ordnance
P10.45. I nailed the used target to my front door, and started wearing
a fanny pack, and it was amazing how the punk sightings diminished
dramatically. I never even had to draw my gun--all I had to do was
convince them I carried one and was willing to use it effectively if
necessary. Of course, if you would rather be shot than live with the
consequences of shooting someone that is your choice. But saying that
having a gun wouldn't make a difference is pretty ignorant--it can
make a HUGE difference IF you are willing to use it--and pay attention
to your surroundings such that you have the gun in hand before you are
in the middle of a circle of assholes with drawn weapons.
