Why not set up a website where minority websurfers could go to read about 
privacy issues and how pseudonymity is to their (and everyone's) benefit.  
After all, how can another person discriminate against you when that person 
knows practically nothing about you (e.g., name, age, race, religion, 
geographic location, etc)?  This would be an excellent way to expand 
cypherpunk technologies, don't you think?
