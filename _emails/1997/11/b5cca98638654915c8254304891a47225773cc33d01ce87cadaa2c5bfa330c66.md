Well at one time there was a demand for cheap labor by US industry that
supported the infux of immagrents. In modern times their is no such demand
( if there were we have plenty of bums on welfare that can fill this need)
but there is a demand for cheap votes. The current Statest have been
watching their power base erroding over the years as more and more
Americans refuse to beleive thier socialist lies. The only way that they
can continue in power is to import new voters who are easier to hoodwink
and cheaper to buy. Confermation of this policy can be seen in the
behavior of the INS durring the last election cycle where large numbers of
immigrants were naturalized before the elections.
