Many insurance companies with Mutual in their name (Liberty Mutual is
large in the Northeastern US) get that from being founded as mutual
insurance companies, where you pay to be part of the mutual insurance
group, and when you get sick, injured, etc, the group pays money
towords your treatment.  I think it broke down with increases in
mobility.  They were implicitly based on reputation capital, and were
not highly fraud resistant.

Adam's suggestion of a charity which only pays for the treatment of
those who donate thus recreates an old system.
