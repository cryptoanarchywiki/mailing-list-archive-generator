>WHEN:    Monday, November 17th, 1997. 
>                No-host dinner: 5:30 - 6:30 p.m.
>                Social hour: 6:00 - 7:00 p.m.
>                Training: 7:00 - 8:30 p.m.
>     
>WHERE:	The College Club, 5th Avenue & Madison Street, 
>		in Seattle.  (Directions later in this notice.)
>
>TOPIC:		Data Mining and KDD: An Introductory Overview
>
>SPEAKER:  	Usama M. Fayyad, Ph.D., Microsoft Research
>
>COST:   	Public $10, NaiF members free. Complimentary parking
>              	until 9 p.m. for all attendees in the College Club garage. 
>
>ABSTRACT
>
>Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and Data Mining are concerned with
>the extraction of high-level information (knowledge) from low-level data
>(usually stored in large databases).  Dr. Fayyad will give an overview of
>this rapidly growing area, define the goals, present motivation, and give a
>high-level definition of the KDD Process and how it relates to Data Mining.
>He will then focus on data mining methods.  These methods have their origins
>in statistics, pattern recognition, learning, visualization, databases, and
>parallel computing.  Basic coverage of a sampling of methods will be
>provided to give a feel for what the methods are about and how they are
>used.  
>
>He will outline the research challenges and opportunities posed by the
>problem of extracting models from massive data sets (i.e., much larger than
>main memory). Operating under such scalability constraints poses interesting
>problems for how models can be built and what methods are practical.  He
>will use an application in astronomy, done at JPL/Caltech, to motivate the
>need for dealing with large databases, to illustrate problems of
>classification and clustering with verylarge data sets, and to illustrate
>how these techniques can offer powerful novel solutions to significant
>problems.
>
>BIOGRAPHY
>
>Usama Fayyad is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research
>(http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/dtg/fayyad)
><http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/dtg/fayyad)> .  After receiving
>the Ph.D. degree in 1991, he joined the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),
>California Institute of Technology, until 1996.  At JPL, he headed the
>Machine Learning Systems Group where he developed data mining systems for
>automated science data analysis.  He remains affiliated with JPL as a
>Distinguished Visiting Scientist.  Dr. Fayyad received the 1993 JPL Lew
>Allen Award for Excellence in Research, and the 1994 NASA Exceptional
>Achievement Medal.   
>He was program co-chair of KDD-94 and KDD-95 (the First International
>Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining).  He was general chair of
>KDD-96, is editor-in-chief of the journal "Data Mining and Knowledge
>Discovery," and co-editor of the new MIT Press book (1996) "Advances in
>Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining."  His research interests include
>knowledge discovery in large databases, data mining, machine learning,
>statistical pattern recognition, and clustering.  
>
>DINNER & AI
>
>NaiF members and non-members are invited to come early and order your own
>dinner from the College Club's delicious and economical menu.  The College
>Club offers free beer and some soft drink selections to Club members and
>their guests (that includes all NaiF program participants) during their
>happy hour" from 5 to 7 p.m.  Why not come directly from work (please arrive
>by 5:30 p.m.) and join the NaiF Board, NaiF members and friends in a great
>dinner before the evening program?  To aid in their planning, the College
>Club requires a count of the NaiF dinner participants.
>R.S.V.P. for the dinner only to Dave Ault (DAAult@Brigadoon.com
><mailto:DAAult@Brigadoon.com> , or 206-783-2917) by Noon on Wednesday,
>November 12th, 1997.
>
>SOCIAL HOUR
>
>Come early (or join us after dinner) and network with other AI professionals
>and enthusiasts during our social hour from 6:00 to 7:00 p.m.  NaiF provides
>complimentary coffee and sodas during the social hour and program
>presentation.
