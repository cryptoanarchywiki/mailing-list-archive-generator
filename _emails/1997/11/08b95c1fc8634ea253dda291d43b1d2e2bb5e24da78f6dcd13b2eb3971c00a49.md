Actually, the cry of "Infowar!" itself could be used as a disruptive
technique.  It undermines dialogue.  It breeds suspicion and paranoia.
It encourages people to think of those who disagree with them as The
Enemy.  It can be used by a mole for cover.

Gee, come to think of it, isn't Lucky the one who keeps trying to
demoralize everyone by saying that Big Brother is inevitable?

And, who was it that was waving around firearms at a Cypherpunks
meeting?  Isn't that a classic provocateur technique?  (See the Earth
First experience, for example.)

Now, I think it's unlikely that Lucky is a mole.  I'm just trying to
show that once you start witch hunting, it turns out that the supply
of witches tends to be highly responsive to demand.

The Back Technique of fighting Infowar seems to be effective.  Treat
the claims of the suspected Infowarrior as if they are credible and
carefully explain why there is an inaccuracy.
