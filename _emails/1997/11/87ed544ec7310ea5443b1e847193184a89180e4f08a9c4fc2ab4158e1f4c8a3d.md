I have a friend from Santa Fe who did some work with Omega and her
opinion was that their purpose in crypto OS development was aimed
toward using it as leverage for being bribed into compromising or
abandoning it in return for government/spook business.

Apparently, there are consultants in some of the former Eastern Bloc
countries who specialize in negotiations between corporations and
shadow agencies in order to find out the highest price they can
sell out or capitulate for without making it worth the spooks time
and effort to sabotage their project or whack them out. It seems
that it can be quite profitable if you don't waste money foolishly
on hiring programmers, engineers, etc.

I have to go now and work on my "Lounge Suit Larry Nukes DC While
Stripping Barbie Naked" program. It uses BAD IDEA encryption.
