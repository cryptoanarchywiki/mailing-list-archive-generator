Oh dear! If interstate commerce is indeed the constitutional 
excuse, er, basis for the FCC (and I don't know that it is),
then current doctrine would probably recognize the following
as providing FCC jurisdiction over micropower stations:

  *  Transmitter/components acquired in Interstate Commerce

  *  Electricity used was generated in part in another state

  *  Station owner deemed to have moved interstate to set up

  *  Air breathed by staff moved across state lines

  *  "Ether" inseparably integral with ether of other states

Once they assert that stuff, bashing a fellow radio station
employee with a burned-out klystron will be a federal crime.

Come to think of it, this might be a good time for anyone in
danger of being in a bar fight to make sure they are wearing
clothes manufactured entirely in the same state and to drink
only locally produced adult beverages.

The way things have been going the entire law enforcment and
criminal justice system could be co-opted by the feds, making
local police just deputized body-collectors for the federal
meat grinder.  Freeh's wet dream, I suppose.
