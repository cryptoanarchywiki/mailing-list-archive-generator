Yep. Kiwi is dead. Most everything that was on kiwi has moved to publius.net.

They are. You can get different perspectives on remailer stats by fingering:

rlist@anon.efga.org
mlist@anon.efga.org (Mixmaster stats)
rlist@anon.lcs.mit.edu
mlist@anon.lcs.mit.edu (guess what)

Or rlist@publius.net; I don't recall what the syntax for the Mixmaster list
is over there (and no, it's not mlist@publius).
