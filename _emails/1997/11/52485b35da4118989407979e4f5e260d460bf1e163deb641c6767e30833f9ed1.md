Indeed, I'm saying I plan to defend myself should a Donald Scott-type
predawn raid occur. (The FBI fax about gun stockpilers, the Northwest
connection, the Jim Bell sentencing at about the same time, and other
indicators tell me that the upcoming months could be crucial.)

Yep, "there's a storm coming." A great line from a great movie.

Those "increasing numbers of laws I'm a felon under" are how the government
threatens those who speak out, those who exercise constitutional rights.
Civil forfeiture, RICO, and selective prosecution are becoming major tools
to suppress dissident actions.

Just so.

Frankly, I have a lot more interest these days in practicing down at the
gun range than I do in trying to "do crypto" by, for example, wading
through the SET specs.

(I heard some talks on SET at last year's Hackers Conference, and it was
mind-numbingly boring stuff. Several pounds of bureaucratic bullshit. And
nothing to do with Cypherpunks goals, either. Just a credit card company
spec, about as Cypherpunkish as exploring printer driver protocols.)

For those forced by their employers to work on SET, may you pray at the
Temple of SET, San Francisco Zodiac Chapter. I'll be somewhere else.
