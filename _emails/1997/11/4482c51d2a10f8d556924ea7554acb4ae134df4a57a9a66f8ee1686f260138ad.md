Mike:

Another little quip for today - pretty sick sense of humor - I got a 
chuckle or two!

To the tune of "Thank God I'm A Country Boy"

  Oh God I'm An Ocean Buoy
   -not by John Denver

   Took a flight from the farm
   and I never came back
   Built a plane from a kit
   But I didn't have the knack
   Jumped in the cockpit
   and downed a six-pack
   And now I'm an ocean buoy

   Well, I grabbed the controls
   And I started to fiddle
   Got flames coming up
   On my face like a griddle
   Air flight ain't nothing
   But a funny, funny riddle
   So now I'm an ocean buoy.

   Well, my head's chopped in pieces
   And my body's full of dents
   They'll identify me
   By my guitar's fingerprints
   I tried to "dry out"
   But instead got a rinse
   And now I'm an ocean buoy

   Well, it's really farrr out
   When you're down 'neath the water
   I just ain't been right
   Since I started on the bottle
   I reach for Jim Beam
   But instead grab the throttle
   And now I'm an ocean buoy

   Well, I grabbed the controls
   And I started to fiddle
   Got flames coming up
   On my face like a griddle
   George Burns appeared beside me
   And we prayed just a little
   Oh God!  I'm an ocean buoy!

   The day's just about over
   And I'm sinking kinda low
   In the undersea world
   of Jacques Cousteau
   Calypso can you find me
   By the bubbles that I blow
   'Cause now I'm an ocean buoy.
