Probably because Heidegger *was* a Nazi, who pranced around in full drag 
Nazi uniform and sent certain of his colleagues to the concentration camps.

To very crudely oversimplify the relationship between Heideggers 
philosophy and Nazism, it goes like this.

No objective, only the intersubjective, therefore the community
defines reality, therefore truth is merely relative to the community.

Yeah, I know it is more complex than that, but it still boils down
to debates being resolved by hanging people from the ceiling with 
piano wire rather than by appeal to the external world.
