No, I mean a real mole.  The kind that gets people killed or
imprisoned.

Actually, the nature of this particular group imposes some twists on
Find The Mole.  If this were some church group, and we tapped the
phone of a suspected mole, and all we could get is 3DES encrypted
speech, we could be pretty sure we found one.  But that doesn't work
around here.  Anytime you see somebody doing something unusual, it is
just as likely to mean it's Just Another Cypherpunk Who Is Up To
Something.

Likewise, operators of a mole will have a terrible time determining
mole loyalty.  A problem with informants is that they sometimes
discover the target group is made up of pretty reasonable people and
go native.  And since using remailers is part of the cover...

Moles can burrow in two directions.
