A few more comments on World War II.

Had World War II been prevented, along with deaths of 50 million or so
people, we would also have been spared (in the United States) income
tax withholding.  Previously the only people paying income tax were
fairly wealthy and there was no withholding.

I doubt very much that income tax withholding would have been accepted
if the War were not used to justify it.  ("You don't want to pay
taxes?  What are you, a traitor?")

Without income tax withholding, it would have been hard to get to the
point where we are now.  The U.S. Federal government consumes about
40% of the GDP.  When the resources aren't wasted outright, they are
used to perpetrate evil in the world.

To put this in perspective, multiply your income by 1.4.  For example,
if your income is $50,000, that would be another $20,000 you would
have every single year.  Where could you spend that money?

If you simply saved it at 3% a year, in 30 years you would have about
$950,000.  That's all for doing exactly what you do now.  Who needs
national health insurance?
