This sounds interesting!  This is what I had in mind, in that other thread
about "What Will Revolution Look Like"

However, this is unfortunate.   Trinkets like these may bring in useful and
needed funds, but they take away from the seriousness of the effort, from
the respect the cause deserves.  They make the wearers look like weenies
playing a child's game, rather than serious individuals in their rights
minds with the concentration and commitment to do important work for the
purpose at hand.

(In a silly mood, I could see a gathering of such supporters in a large,
crowded courtroom, all wearing T-shirts saying, "It's *ShowTime* !!!" )
