In a world where government agencies using fear of the 'enemy' and
bragging about their 'dirty tricks' to gain increasing funding, I 
am surprised that few seem to realize that many of the 'bugs' are 
actually 'features,' and that when one finds a true, non-designed bug 
in major hardware or software, there are certain government agencies
which may pay handsomely for the information, depending on the potential
and obscurity of the bug.
In a world where the value of 'tracking chips' and 'kill switches' on
personal automobiles is recognized, does anyone truly believe that
government agencies with billions of dollars worth of funding have
not recognized and instituted this technology surrupticiously in the
same areas where they brag about introducing 'faulty parts' into
weapons systems?

The government is desperate to maintain their electronic snooping and
warfare abilities as Year2000 approaches.
Hardware & Software == Intel & MicroSoft == VX-Chip & GAK/GMR

The government is using Anti-Trust actions to muscle both computer
giants.
A million dollar a day assault on MicroSoft, and release of compromising
'bug' information to put the squeeze on Intel.
