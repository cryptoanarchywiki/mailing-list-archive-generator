I would like to air the following lectures on the
Mbone, through videotaping and rebroadcast.  Our
AV Dept. will charge $50 for a basic videotaping.
Would anyone like to donate $50 to UMBC
to make this happen?  (Please make out check
to "UMBC".)  Thanks.

   The UMBC Security Technology Research Group presents

	     Two Views on Encryption Policy:

I.  Wisdom and Constitutionality in US Cryptography Policy
 John Gilmore, Co-Founder, Electronic Frontier Foundation

  II. A Law-Enforcement Perspective on Encryption Policy
       Barry Smith, Supervisory Special Agent, FBI

Two divergent views on the topic of encryption policy by
freedom activist John Gilmore and FBI spokesperson Barry
Smith.  Journalist Peter Wayner will moderate the event,
which is free and open to the public.

  8-10:30 pm
  Tuesday, December 16, 1997
  Lecture Hall III 
  University of Maryland Baltimore County
  http://www.cs.umbc.edu/events/fall97/crypto.shtml

The fifth employee of Sun Microsystems and a strong believer
in the U.S. Constitution, John Gilmore is currently involved
in litigation against several government agencies over
matters of freedom of information, freedom of expression,
and encryption policies.  He will discuss the
constitutionality of controlling encryption. Barry Smith
will articulate the needs of law enforcement to conduct
lawful wiretaps; he will advocate the use of key-recovery
techniques to achieve this end as a way that provides
adequate privacy to law-abiding citizens.

Directions: Take Exit #47B off interstate I-95 and follow
signs to UMBC.  LH III is on the ground floor of the (tall)
administration building, adjacent the visitor's parking
lot, near the I-95 entrance to UMBC.
