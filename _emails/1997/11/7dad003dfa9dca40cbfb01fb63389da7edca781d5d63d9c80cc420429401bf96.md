I have come to believe that "assassination politics" is a political 
Rorschach (ink-blot) test: What you think of it is strongly related 
to your political philosophy.
~ Jim Bell, "Assassination Politics"

  It's a shame that Bell wasn't prosecuted and judged by people with
a clearer conscience and more a more democratic political philosophy.

  Why are people invariably under the impression that it is someone
other than themself that is putting them on The List (TM)?
