Yes, I understand this.  Nobody with a grain of sense

An insurance broker and a bookie are in the same business.
A bookie takes a bet from me, at 1000 to 1 odds, for some
unlikely to occur event--which he thinks has a probability
of less than 1/1000.  An insurance broker does the same
thing.  The only important difference is my purpose in
placing the bet.  When I take out medical insurance, I am
placing a bet that I will get sick enough to spend more than
my deductable on doctors.  The insurance broker estimates
(based on whatever information is available) the probability
that this will happen, and makes me a bet at odds that are
in his favor, if his estimate is true.  If I get sick, I get
some money (or my doctors do).  If I stay well, I lose the
bet.  This is just paying someone to take some risk off my
hands.

Right.  I don't think I expressed my point too clearly,
because you seem to have responded to something different
than what I was saying.  Suppose there is some genetic
disease that kills its victims on their 31st birthday,
unless they get a $1,000,000 treatment first.  Before I have
taken the test for this disease, I have to accept a certain
risk--if I find out I have the disease, I have to raise a
million dollars in the next few months.  After I have taken
the test and gotten back the results, there's no more risk
involved (assuming the test is perfect)--I either have the
disease or I don't.  After the test, insurance isn't useful
(unless I defraud my insurer).  Before the test, though,
insurance might be useful--I could essentially place a bet
with someone that I had the disease--I pay $1, and get a
million dollars back if my test comes back positive--just
enough to pay for my treatment.

I know.  Let me make it clear that I am not at all
interested in banning private testing, coercing insurance
companies or anyone else into agreements they don't want to
make, etc.  I am saying it would be nice if I could buy
insurance against the results of the tests before I took
them.  The problem is, I can't see a really workable way to
do this, because there's no way to keep people from taking
the test beforehand.
