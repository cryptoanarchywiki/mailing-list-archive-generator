You might get some entropy from it -- but you won't get my PRNG state!
An attacker is welcome to the entropy, but may find it cheaper to
generate his own entropy than to copy some of mine.

There are certain attacks which become possible when an attacker can
snarf a copy of your randseed.bin, eg. the attacker can predict
session keys if he can guess your plaintext, and you are using an
environment which does not allow pgp2.x to sample your keystrokes (eg
integrated mail scripts).

randseed.bin is more sensitive than people treat it.  pgp2.x encrypts
private keys because people could use them to decrypt traffic, but it
does not encrypt the randseed.bin which could in some circumstances
also allow traffic to be decrypted.

An ergonomic disadvantage of encrypting randseed.bin is that you would
need to enter the passphrase to decrypt it before being able to
encrypt messages.  (You could make that optional -- and just use it in
encrypted form when you couldn't be bothered entropy shows through :-)

Encrypted public and private key rings is a separate good, and this
because it obscures who you are talking to and what your nyms are.
premail does this for you.
