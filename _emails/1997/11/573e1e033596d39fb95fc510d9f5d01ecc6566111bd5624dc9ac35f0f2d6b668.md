Don't you just love the smell of ozone in the morning?

:-). What? Me? Reputation? I *thought* I had one around here somewhere...


Anyway, I'm not so sure about your above assertion. We can quibble about
*which* great awakening it was I thought was the first one, of course, but
you yourself posted the facts which bore out what I was saying to my own
satisfaction, and, I'd bet way past what most anyone else around here who
cares about the discussion, would say, as well.

Close only counts in horseshoes, hand grenades and cypherpunk rants?

Yup. You're obvious evidence of that. Congratulations on all of your
accomplishments. Enjoy your smug self-satisfaction. Clearly you must have
earned it...

:-).


Cheers,
