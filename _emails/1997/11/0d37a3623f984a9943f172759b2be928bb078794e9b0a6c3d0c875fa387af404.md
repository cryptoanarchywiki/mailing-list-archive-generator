In late September, I attended a meeting of the BXA's Regulations &
Procedures Technical Advisory Committee in Portland (OR), where there was
some discussion of crypto export control regulations, plans for changes to
those regs, etc. There will be another meeting of that group on 12/9/97 at
9 AM in the (Herbert C., not J. Edgar) Hoover Building, Room 3884, between
Pennsylvania & Constitution Avenues, NW, in Washington DC. The agenda is:

1.	Opening remarks by the Chairperson.
2.	Presentation of papers or comments by the public.
3.	Update on the encryption regulation.
4.	Update on the Wassenaar Arrangement implementation regulation.
5.	Discussion on the "deemed export" issue.
6.	Discussion on the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative and the
continued publication of Entities of Concern.
7.	Update on the Automated Export System.
8.	Discussion on efforts to conform the Foreign Trade Statistics
Regulations and the Export Administration Regulations on export clearance
requirements.

[Closed session]
9.	Discussion of matters properly classified under Executive Order 19958,
dealing with U.S. export control program and strategic criteria related
thereto.
