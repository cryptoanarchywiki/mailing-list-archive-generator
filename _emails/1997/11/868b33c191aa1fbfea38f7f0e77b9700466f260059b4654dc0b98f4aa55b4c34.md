Dimitri,

Thanks for reposting Kent's slur of toads.

Where to begin defense of toadism? Why not with Toad,
(see from above) the mother of toads, the nodehome of thousands 
of Toadies, year after year, even now for few, until ... well, no 
need for that again.

How about the newly built To, the safehome of www.cpunks.

Toto? Maybe a stretch.

Request-Remailing-To:? Now, that's close family.

Come on, Kent, why deny the fundamental purpose of the Net:

Send to:
Spoof to:
Lie to:
Obnox to:
Joke to:

Friendly crowds of to-addicts.
