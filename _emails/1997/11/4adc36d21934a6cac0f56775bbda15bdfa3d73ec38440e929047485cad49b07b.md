The Microsoft spoofers, who work for Palladium Interactive
software, didn't let the feel-good fest rain on their parade. They
said their tiny Larkspur, Calif. company drew lots of interest in
their parody of Microsoft's upcoming Windows 98 operating
program, which goes by a name that can't be mentioned here
because of its sexual connotations. 

The program includes games such as Billagotchi, an on-screen
"cyber pet" that people need to feed money and tend to his needs
or else he throws a tantrum. 

For example, the parody includes an icon for "MS Exploiter" that
links to a Palladium Web site. And in a skit based on Star Trek,
cartoon characters from the Star Ship Explorer blow up the SS
Netscape. 

"The party line is if you don't have a booth, you can't hand out
literature," said Rebecca Murphy, director of product marketing
for the firm.
                     
"We're just trying to have some fun."
