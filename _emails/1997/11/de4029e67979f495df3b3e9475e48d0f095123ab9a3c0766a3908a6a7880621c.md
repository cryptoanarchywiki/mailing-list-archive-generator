Freeware and shareware often share the same distribution channel.  It kind
of puts a crimp in distribution if you cannot upload to any archive that
might wind up on a cd-rom.  (Furthermore, uploads to those archives are not
always under the control of the author.)

Hopefully they will go back and update the freeware license agreement as well.
