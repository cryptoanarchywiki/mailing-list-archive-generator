I wrote about this report a year ago, and took a critical look at it:

   http://cgi.pathfinder.com/netly/editorial/0,1012,31,00.html

            The sound bite would have made George Bush proud: "No New
   Internet Taxes."
        At least that's how articles in c|netand the New York Times
   described the recommendations of a Treasury Department report released
   last Thursday. The Times quoted Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
   Summers as saying, "The key message of the report is, no Internet
   taxes." Indeed, the 46-page draft sketches out the Clinton
   administration's tax policy for the Internet and says that no
   additional taxes should be imposed on the Net.
       But, dear reader, you have to read the fine print. Which I did.
   That's where one finds the very clear suggestion that existing tax
   laws must be extended to encompass the Internet -- in the kind of
   clumsy and misinformed way that has typified federal forays into
   legislating online behavior. The theme of the report is clear: Since
   taxation is largely based on physical presence, the nature of the Net
   represents a threat to the taxman. Not surprisingly, the IRS could
   well return the favor by increasing its role in cyberspace.
