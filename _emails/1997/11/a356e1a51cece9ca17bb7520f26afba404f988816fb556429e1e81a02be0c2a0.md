[Long discussion about crypto-anarchy vs. democracy removed]

I suggest reframing the argument.  Right now, the discussion seems to
be: "If we were Gods, how would we institute a just political system
on these people."  Unfortunately, only a few Gods are reading the
cypherpunks list and they refuse to do our bidding.

The real question is: what should we do?

Our (oversimplified) choices:

1. Democracy: Participate in the political process by joining various
   organizations, lobbying, begging for money, voting, etc. etc.

2. Crypto-Anarchy: Write code, buy guns, make money, make more money,
   etc. etc.

The second choice is clearly better in terms of protecting your own
hide.

What if we want to protect the hides of other people?  I believe
choice 2 is still the better one.  In any event, this is the more
interesting discussion.

The problem with choice 1 is that even if you can convince yourself
that a group of people and an institution are sound and reliable
today, you do not know what it will be doing later on.  Choice 2, on
the other hand, is a low risk investment and brings you into contact
with a better group of people.
