	Does that mean you expect others to say anti-semitic stuff or claim that
you are being anti-semitic.  I would go with the latter.  Are you orthodox?
 If not, what right do you have to bash conservative or reform jews?  If
you are, please tell your friends in Israel that those of us with families
who survived the death camps do not look kindly on their reinvention of
fascism.  It is all well and good to love the group you come from, but
especially if you are jewish, pay attention to history.  Have we not been
persecuted throughout history, how dare we, now that we have some measure
of power, go on to persecue others?  Think before you write please.
	On your other point, christians routinely break the _important_
commandments.  (the first two)  Go to any church and you will see no end to
the idols they set up to their various saints, gods, etc.  And they pray to
whatever saint they want, or mary, or jesus (a mere messenger, even if the
son of god, he ain't god) or whoever they feel like.  Whatever happenned to
'Thou shalt have no gods before me!'
