Java isn't so bad.  Just in time compilers are being shipped with some
browsers (netscape on some platforms).  Sun now has native bigint
library (good for you know what, and exportable because they haven't
included the few lines required to implement public key encryption
with it).

Modula-3 is also fairly clean... garbage collection, bounds checked
arrays, etc.  A `safe' language.  There is indeed a m3 -> c
translator.  I think GNU were working on a m3 module for their
retargetable gcc compiler suite (to go with ada, C, fortran, pascal).
I did hear talk of a java gcc front end also.

I think there would be advantages to always tunneling the encrypted
messages inside PGP, that way no snoops know you're using it, until
it's too late.

That's a reasonable idea if you're going to use things like IDEA( k1,
3DES( k2, data ) ).

Forward secrecy is what you want for GAK resistance -- can't get much
more GAK hostile than burning your keys seconds after message receipt.

What's wrong with the randseed.bin and the public and private key
rings is that they should all be encrypted with a key derived from
your passphrase.

Linux's /dev/random might not be bad.  There is some real entropy in
key strokes and mouse movements, and they are quite conservative about
entropy estimation.  You can easily make it more conservative -- XOR
together a load of it to derive a smaller key.

That'd be fine.  Personally not being a hardware type, I am suspicious
of hardware RNGs.. I can't tell when they are going wrong.. failure
modes can be dangerous (whoops lead fell of geiger tube), etc.
Software and computers are easier to understand.  Provided you XOR the
lot together you should be fine though.

One thing that is sorely needed in my opinion is a simple way to
integrate with existing mailers.  Ie to have some code which acts as
an interface between various extensible email based functions
(remailers, signatures, DC nets, keyservers) and MUAs.  Then someone
gets to fight with the plugin API once, and after that we can
automatically add features which work with lots of MUAs.

The future is in extensibility.  Java is pretty good for this.
