Jonah,

Contrary to what you claim, I'm not "trying to accomplish" anything except
report the facts. (Somehow you don't seem to like them very much.) You'll
remember that when I wrote about the Coats CDA II bill, I included one
paragraph about the history of "harmful to minors" legislation:

>Coats' brainchild is strikingly similar to (and in fact not
>as broad as) an ill-fated version of the first CDA that
>Rep. Rick White (R-Wash.) and the Center for Democracy and
>Technology embraced as a "compromise" in December 1995.
>Like Coats' bill, the White-CDT measure restricted material
>that was "harmful to minors."

Then CDT responded to my article publicly, incorrectly claiming that CDT
did not embrace the harmful to minors "compromise." My post was to correct
those inaccuracies and clear the air -- and, you'll remember I concluded by
saying I hoped we could move forward to discussing Coats. You seem unable
-- or unwilling -- to do that.

So, if you insist, we'll revisit your "harmful to minors" compromise.
You're now denying that CDT's Jerry Berman stood up with Rick White and
Bruce "CDA" Taylor in a House hearing room to announce the "compromise?"
You're arguing that the three press reports I forwarded about CDT
supporting the "compromise" are inaccurate?
