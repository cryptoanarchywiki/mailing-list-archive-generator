Declan, anyone, is this flood of statements due to an 
industry campaign, or one by Majortiy Leader Lott, 
or Speaker Gingrich, or a combination, or what?

What's your insider intel, Declan, will these initiatives continue
into the next session or are they just cheap dues paying 
for the moment, while getting ready to sellout when the 
rain of if-you-knew-what-we've-been-briefed shit showers 
down next year?

What's Kerrey, McCain, Solomon counter-campaigning 
with the TLAs?
