It's what I've been saying here! The ban is coming.

Translation: We passed some laws, importers found ways to fully comply with
the laws (at their expense). But now we're going to ignore the law, and
ignore their compliance, and take steps to force these importers out of
business.

Amerika is no longer a nation of laws. Even the draconian laws are ignored
for political grandstanding.

I quit the NRA a few years ago, feeling it was too wimpy and namby pamby
about basic rights.

They tried to bargain with the Administration, they tried to reach a
"compromise." This is what it got them.

There are obvious lessons for the crypto industry here. And for the efforts
by CDT, EPIC, and others to negotiate with politicians.
