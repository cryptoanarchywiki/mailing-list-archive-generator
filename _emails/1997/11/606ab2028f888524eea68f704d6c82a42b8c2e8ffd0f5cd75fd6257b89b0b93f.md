I assume it was deliberate - it goes out of its way to say that you
can't use it to generate revenues, directly or indirectly,
and even including it on a disk of freeware that you sell
would appear to count, as would providing the free widget for
free download on a web page with commercial advertising banners.

It's far more restrictive than the previous PGP policies,
and not being able to use it in my office building is even more
annoying than not being able to use it to encrypt work email.

I'm not bothered by the freeware permissions not applying to shareware;
it would be nice if they negotiate a low enough price for shareware
authors to use, but if you're going to make money off their code,
I don't mind if PGP wants their cut.  
				Thanks!
