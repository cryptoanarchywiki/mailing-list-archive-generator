Out of curiosity, what protection is there for PGP 5.x users submitting keys
to the keyservers? Would it not be trivial for somebody to see what dialup
SLIP link a key is coming from and tie that key to the person submitting it?

That isn't a problem for personal keys, but it is a big problem for
psuedonyms. Is there some kind of mechanism in place for submitting such
keys via anonymous remailers? 

This might already have been covered by other Cypherpunks or the PGP folks.
