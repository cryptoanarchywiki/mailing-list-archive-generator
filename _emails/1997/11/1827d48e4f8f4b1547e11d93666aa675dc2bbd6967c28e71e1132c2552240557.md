	Its the overuse of the generic.  Cryptolib and Cryptlib are
different.  Quick, who wrote which?  I can't keep it straight.  (I
have web pages for that. :)  I can distinguish out BSAFE and SSLeay.

	Crowding is only a small problem.  If the names were better,
it would not be an issue.  The ordering on the page is the order I
created them, and it will not be changed due to the inordinate effort
required to change an HTML table.
