Here in Australia the media has been giving this trial regular coverage
with the spin "Innocent English Person Wrongly Found Guilty by US Jury".
The coverage led me to believe that despite scientific evidence to  the
contrary the jury found Woodward guilty.  One other point from the
coverage was that Woodward represented herself for at least some part of
the trial, did Jim Bell do this too?

Obviously Tim you have been exposed to very different media coverage.
