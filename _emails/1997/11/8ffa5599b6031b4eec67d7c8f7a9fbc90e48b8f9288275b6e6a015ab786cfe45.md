'mere ferrets'? You obviously don't know much about the predatory nature of
the mustella clan (ferrets, weasels, badgers, etc.). From a predator
stand-point they are excellent hunters, routinely killing prey *three* times
their body weight by themselves. By no means is that routine of predators of
any ilk other than felines (statisticaly hitting 70% kill rates on average,
dogs do good if they hit 40% in packs). You should do a little research into
mustella negripe, the American Black-footed Ferret (distantly related to the
European Ferret at best).

No, being a ferret is *not* an insult but rather a compliment. Pound for
pound if you got to pick a fight don't pick one with felines or mustellids
they *will* kick your weasy little butt.

And yes, I am a cat & ferret lover.
