Isn't it amazing how they can "predict" thing like that?

Maybe you ought to give (or sell cheaply) your fellow "databasix goon" Gary
Burnore the clue that if he's going to call an alleged "spammer" on the phone 
at 2 AM and ream him about a Usenet post, that he shouldn't brag about it 
publicly.

And yet he did exactly that.  Would it be any wonder if people were to
start suspecting that he might have done the same thing again?

Now go subpoena those phone records.  You might want to concentrate on calls
made from the Raleigh-Durham, NC area.  If you're alluding to the fact that 
Ron Guilmette may have been responsible, since the disinformation team at
DataBasix has accused him practically everything else, you have about as
much chance of proving that as O.J. Simpson does of "finding the real 
killers".

One could conceivably substitute "DataBasix" for "NANAE" in that flame.
