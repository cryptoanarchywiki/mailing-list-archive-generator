Ding! You rang? Welcome to Random Acts of Kindness, Inc. Our motto: "You never
know when we're going to make your day!"...

Ryan, if you get airfare to Anguilla somehow, we'll find a way to put you
up and feed you. And comp you your conference badge, of course. *But*, you may
have to work (some) for it...

Thank you for playing "Be Careful What You Wish For"... :-).


By the way, the FC98 organizing committee has decided, it appears, that we
can't fight mother nature, much less celestial mechanics, and we're probably
(it might mess up a lot of people's schedules, which is why we say "probably"
right now) just going to skip conference sessions on Thursday so people can go
park a boat (bring lots of dramamine, the waves start in Africa) off
Montserrat(!) or wherever, to see the total eclipse. We're probably also going
to mount an organized (such as it is) official FC98-sanctioned expedition
to do it.


Now, exactly *how* far can a pyroclastic flow go out to sea?...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
