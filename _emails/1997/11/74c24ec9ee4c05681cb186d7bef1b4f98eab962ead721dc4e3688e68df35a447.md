You should have done your research better.

This report by the Cato Institute based on a report by the Urban Institute
is based on *Legal* Immigrants.

>Studies that report a decline in immigrant income and education levels
>often referred to as immigrant "quality" fail to take into account the

In after reviewing the some of the documents at the Urban Institute web
site http://www.urban.org I would hardly call them a libertarian
orginization.
