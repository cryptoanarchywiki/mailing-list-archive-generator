Cypango Ventures Ltd. ( http://www.mxtro.com/cypango  ) is poised to
join the ranks of Canada's leading diamond producers.  It is anticipated 
that Canada will produce 25 % of the world's diamonds by the end
of 1998.  Cypango has acquired controlling interest in over 3.5 million
acres which surround the soon to be producing BHP/DiaMet 
properties in Canada's Northwest Territories.

BHP/DiaMet is expected to be in production next year, and Cypango 
Ventures, Ltd. has already located five "Kimberlite pipes", the prehistoric 
geological formations that give birth to the world's most
coveted diamonds.

Cypango Ventures, Ltd trades on the Vancouver Stock Exchange under the
symbol "CAV".
