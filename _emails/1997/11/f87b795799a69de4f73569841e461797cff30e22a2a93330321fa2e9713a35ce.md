It's not tough - you can get implants for your cat or dog for ~$25.
They're installed by a vet, but it's a simple subcutaneous injection,
so all they need to do is disinfect the site, pinch some skin,
and inject it carefully, (and try to keep from getting bitten.)
No different for injecting in into a human, except the government 
wants you to have their permission to practice medicine,
and you may not need to worry about getting bitten.
