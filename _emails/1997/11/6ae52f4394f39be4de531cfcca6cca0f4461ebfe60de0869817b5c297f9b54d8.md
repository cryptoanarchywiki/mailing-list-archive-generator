And then asked:

: 
: Is it legal to export '37'?
: How about '148'?
: '276'?
: '3,289,534'?
: '6.33458'?

Perhaps I was not clear enough.  The U.S. government's classifications
that I wrote about had to do with one-time pad programs, not the pads
themselves.  

I know of nothing official that says that the pads themselves are
exportable, but there is nothing in the regulations that suggests they
are not.  Random number and encrypted messages are not regulated by
the U.S. export regulations; only ``encryption software'' is
regulated.  So far as I know the government has never claimed that
one-time pads are, or are not, subject to the export regulations.

If anyone knows of a governmental classification relating to the
export status of one-time pads themselves, I would be very grateful
for a reference.

Thanks,
Peter
