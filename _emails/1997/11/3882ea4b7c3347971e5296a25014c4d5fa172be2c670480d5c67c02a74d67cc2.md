This, unfortunately, is a non-issue.  I just reread the license agreement
and noticed the following:

Non-Commercial Distribution License.

 Subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, PGP hereby
grants to you or your organization a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable
license (a) to incorporate [... stuff deleted ...] 
and (b) to reproduce and distribute the Bundled Freeware Application to end
users solely by electronic means (for example, posting on networks or
Internet sites for others to download), 

So, the only way to really (legally) distribute this would be on your own
web site, or a web site that will never be picked up on a cdrom
distribution.

The as of yet unreleased shareware licensing agreements will probably cover
cdrom distribution.
