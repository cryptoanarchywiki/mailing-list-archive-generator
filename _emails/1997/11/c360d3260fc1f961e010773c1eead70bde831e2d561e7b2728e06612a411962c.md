Not to mention GATT and the WTO.  I don't think the US can unilaterally 
mandate a particular electronic commerce scheme and force it on electronic 
merchants in Mongolia (the freest trading country on earth these days).  

That's why when Pat said GATT would destroy U.S. soveriegnty, I said "I sure 
hope so."

Though most hotels actually want credit cards and believe that credit cards 
are a form of ID even though they most certainly are not.

I was asked for a picture ID before being shown an apartment.  Real Estate 
agent concern about crime directed at them?

"I'm Canadian.  I don't have an SS#."  Works for everything that can be 
purchased or joined by Canadians in the US.

Very true.

The Finanzia Guardia (pardon my Italian spelling) (Financial Police) in Italy 
enforce the Italian requirement for receipts by fining customers who can't 
produce them.  Designed to back up VAT collection.  I noticed that most 
receipts there were generated by PCs under control of shopkeepers.  Good 
opportunities for keeping double books.  I wonder if Italy mandates POS and 
accounting software?

Though the New Jersey Gestapo *have* been attending computer, collector, etc. 
shows and demanding resale certificates, estimating revenue based on 
displayed stock, and seizing stock if not paid.  (Not recommended at gun 
shows -- which have been driven out of NJ in any case).  Hard work for the 
revenooers, though.

Uttering checks is from the dawn of commercial paper under common law.  I'm 
sure Eric read it in one of the banking books he likes to read.

No kidding.
