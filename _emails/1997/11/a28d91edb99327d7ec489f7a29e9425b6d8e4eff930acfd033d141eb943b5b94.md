          (TAMPA) -- Federal marshals and local deputies have shut down
          three Tampa area ``pirate'' radio stations, silencing unlicensed
          sources of rock music and far-right ideology. Authorities carted
          off broadcast and studio equipment from all three stations and
          dismantled a rooftop antenna that stood over one broadcaster's
          home. One of the stations was operated by 53-year-old Arthur
          Kobres, who is named in a 14- count indictment alleging
          violations of national broadcasting laws.  Authorities say
          Kobres used his equipment to broadcast anti-government messages.

          Also silenced was ``Tampa's Party Pirate,'' a 100-watt F-M
          station run by Doug Brewer. A third operator who was shut
          down... 22-year-old Kelly Benjamin... was also arrested for
          possession of marijuana.
