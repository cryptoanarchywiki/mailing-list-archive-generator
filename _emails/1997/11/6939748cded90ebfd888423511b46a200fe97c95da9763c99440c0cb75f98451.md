I generally agree, except that if you're trying to determine in a big hurry if
a potential contractor is worth hiring, and you become aware that s/he exhibits
a trait that you believe is corelated with being a mentally retarded sociopath
(e.g., is a Klintonista or (a guy) wears a pair of earrings to an interview),
then you should proceed to the next candidate.

But then some of the other folks working there will likely start looking for
other jobs... and it's damn hard to find good people, be it in NYC or in the
Silicon Valley - harder than to find a job. :-)

Ever since Sun Micro fired Philip Stromer for posting "homophobic" jokes to
Usenet, I've done what I could to hurt their sales. I estimate the value of
sales where Sun boxes were considered, I asked that no Suns be bought, and
other boxes (HPs etc) were purchased, to be about $60MM. (Of course, my inputs
were almost never pivotal, but I made my opinion known.) I also boycott
their software.

It's a pity Whit Diffie works for a company that fires people for posting
"homophobic" jokes to Usenet.
