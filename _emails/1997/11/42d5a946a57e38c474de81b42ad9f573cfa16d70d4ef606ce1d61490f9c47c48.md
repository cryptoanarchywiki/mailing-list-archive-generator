A reminder that the consitutional issues of "Hit Man" and similar cases 
are reviewed in the Department of Justice's April 1997 report to Congress, 

   "The Availability of Bombmaking Information, and the Extent to Which 
   Its Dissemination May Be Subject to Regulation Consistent with the 
   First Amendment to the United States Consitution":
