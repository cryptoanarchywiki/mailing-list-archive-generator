Flight 800, actually.....
KAL007 was the Korean plane shot down by Russians.

Is that multi-million-dollar explosive-sniffers,
or have they developed dollar-sniffers to support the War On Cash :-)

One of the parts that's irked me most about this (as distinct from
outrage at the loss of civil liberties) is that the thugs won't even
come out and say "The Government Requires You To Have Papers To Travel",
since they can't do that, at least without PR problems.
Instead they bully the airlines into requiring more obedience to 
avoid arbitrary $10,000 FUD penalties than a direct law could require.
And the airline employees keep telling me "it's always been this way"
a couple of weeks after each change of the rules.

				Thanks!
