You are doing something slightly different from people who respond to
a point with "Heideggar?  That Nazi!"

The people who do this are short circuiting the discussion instead of
showing how the point made is in error.  In a sense, they are not
discussing an idea, but the group affiliations of each speaker.

I find that the ideas are more interesting.

(Although, if one were interested in Heideggar, his biography would
probably be interesting, too.)
