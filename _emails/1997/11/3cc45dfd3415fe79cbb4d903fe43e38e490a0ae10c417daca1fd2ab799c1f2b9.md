Oops! President's fax line made public

WASHINGTON (November 20, 1997 5:06 p.m. EST) -- The House 
committee investigating campaign fund raising briefly posted
President Clinton's personal fax number on the Internet this 
week, despite a request that it keep the number private.

White House press secretary Mike McCurry called the incident 
"a procedural lapse" on the part of the House Government 
Reform and Oversight Committee chaired by Rep. Dan Burton, 
R-Ind.

A committee spokesman said the public posting of the number 
of the president's fax machine was a quickly corrected and 
"inadvertent" mistake with no malicious intent.

McCurry said the White House is concerned because the fax 
machine, located just outside the Oval Office, serves as 
the president's sounding board, a personal link to hundreds 
of friends and acquaintances around the country.

"It would be a source of concern to the White House because 
that's a very valuable way in which the president maintains 
contact with an incredibly diverse group of Americans," 
McCurry said.

"It's not the first time that they've had some procedural 
lapses," McCurry said of the Burton committee.

The incident was reported Thursday by Roll Call, a newspaper 
that covers Congress.

The committee obtained the fax number when it was mentioned 
by former Clinton political consultant Dick Morris during 
a deposition last August.

The committee failed to black it out when it posted the 
Morris deposition on the Internet Tuesday.

Will Dwyer, a spokesman for the committee said the number 
was available to the public for no more than an hour.

He contended committee lawyers had never definitively 
promised Morris to keep it private although Morris did 
ask that it and his private phone numbers not be disclosed. 
"I don't think we have breached any agreement," Dwyer said.

Dwyer took issue with McCurry's assertion that the incident 
was one of a series of lapses on the committee's part. "He's 
making a mountain out of a molehill," he said. "As soon as 
we discovered it we corrected it. There was no intent for 
anything malicious to occur here."
