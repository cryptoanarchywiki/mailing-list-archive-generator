I got spammed by someone selling Cryptx, a DES-based encryption program.
I'm assuming they know they're spamming; at least the person who
sent the email did, though perhaps the vendor doesn't understand it.
In addition to selling crypto, their web page says they also sell an
"Automates the process of submitting your URL's to over 370 sites!"
which is at least on the borderline tacky side.

Their web page doesn't look like snake oil, though they _really_ 
need to emphasize the importance of good keys 
(they talk about DES having been cracked once by the distributed 
internet crack, and neglect to mention that DES with easy-to-guess 
keys has been cracked regularly for years.  
So not only do the Bad Guys abuse the level of effort of the crack, 
but so do well-meaning but clueless people.) 
I'd guess they don't do anything like generating a random high-entropy 
session key and encrypting it with a passphrase.
Also, they promise an "Update to 448-Bit encryption", which says
that even if there's no snake oil now, there may be soon.
Upgrade so you can email your encrypted files right through Cryptx. You
will never have to worry about sending uncompromised email again.

All of the domain names in the SPAM are from directsend.com

Their web page also says they have offices in Portland and Toronto,
