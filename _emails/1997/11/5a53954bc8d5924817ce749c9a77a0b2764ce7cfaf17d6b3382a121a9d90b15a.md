There are still three more amicus briefs filed with the court, which
are not yet on the Web.

The Government's reply is due on November 20; we'll provide page images
shortly thereafter.

The appeal hearing is on December 8 at 9AM at the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals, 95 Seventh Street, San Francisco.
