Perhaps Ralph could help the anonymous remailer 'cause' by providing
remailer operators with a list of the 'bad' people who should not
be allowed to use remailers to promote their 'wrong' views.
Maybe Mr. Hotmail could also provide a list of 'bad' words and
'bad' subjects that should be blocked, as well.

I suggest blocking Ralphie 'Kiss Your Remailer Goodbye' Hotmail.
Of course, I'm a Nazi fuck...
