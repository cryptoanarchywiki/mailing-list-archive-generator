Eugene Kashpureff, known for his redirect of the NSI web page, was 
apprehended this morning in Toronto by undercover RCMP detectives.

Pending a deportation hearing, he will be returned to New York to face 
Felony Wire Fraud charges that were sworn out against him after he had 
settled out of court with NSI in regard to their civil suit.

Early in the week Eugene relinquished control of the Alternic to an adhoc 
industry group.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is alledged there are 40,000 individual charges being laid agains Euegene.

It is strongly expected ISP's and DNS operators world wide will provide
support to Eugene through RSC organisation to ensure his safe return.
