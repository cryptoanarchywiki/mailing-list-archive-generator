  Not that they are preparing to take fascist control of all 
electronic funds in preparation for the coming Financial Holocaust.
  Has anyone that you can't look *anywhere* in the government
regulatory scheme without seeing signs of preparation for 
*seizing* control of information, finances and communications?

  I remember going into a black bar in a very bad neighborhood
in Seattle and being befriended by the nicest black man in the
whole world. After sharing intimate buddy-buddy details of his
life with me he suggested that if I gave him my wallet to hold
then I wouldn't have to worry about some of the "bad" black
people in the establishment robbing me.
  I didn't give him my wallet, but I _did_ vote for him. {;>)
