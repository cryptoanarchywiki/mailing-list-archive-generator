And what would be wrong with this?

If they're not citizens, and not on a valid visa, they have no legal right
to be in the U.S.

(At a more abstract level, I support the idea of completely open borders,
provided we end all forcible contributions to welfare, medical care,
schools, job quotas, etc. But so long as taxpayers are paying 60% of
everything earned, as I am, to support others, the rules about entry to the
U.S. must be enforced.)

Ironically, the authorities are refusing to enforce the immigration laws.
This is why the militias here in California have been forced to deal with
illegal immigrants in the only way left to them. (There's a hunt in
Imperial Valley this coming Saturday.)
