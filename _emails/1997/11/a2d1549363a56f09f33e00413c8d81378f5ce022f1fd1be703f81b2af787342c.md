               The Digital Commerce Society of Boston

                            Presents

                        Dr. James O'Toole
                        Open Market, Inc.

              Digital Coupons and Distributed Commerce

                      Tuesday, December 2, 1997
                             12 - 2 PM
                 The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
                   One Federal Street, Boston, MA


Jim says,

"Open Market's Transact commerce system version 3.0 introduces
new Digital Coupon capabilities that enable merchants to create
price promotion and special discount offers for their customers.
Digital Coupons provide a secure way for an online merchant to
easily implement repricing rules that a Transact-based distributed
commerce system uses to adjust prices at the point of sale.
This talk will include a brief overview of Open Market's commerce
product suite and their architecture.  I will explain how Digital
Coupons work, provide concrete details of how Transact 3.0
processes coupons and their impact on APIs, screens, and smart
statements.  I will also discuss the implications of digital coupons
and similar artifacts on the design of distributed commerce solutions
that rely on trusted intermediaries."

Dr. O'Toole is a senior member of the research and advanced development
staff of Open Market.  His current focus is on technology development and
software product architecture.  In 1997, Jim was responsible for the
conception of Open Market's Digital Coupon products.  Prior to joining Open
Market in 1996, Jim completed his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.


This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held on
Tuesday, November 4, 1997, from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of the
Harvard Club of Boston, on One Federal Street. The price for lunch is
$32.50. This price includes lunch, room rental, various A/V hardware, and
the speaker's lunch. ;-).  The Harvard Club *does* have dress code: jackets
and ties for men (and no sneakers or jeans), and "appropriate business
attire" (whatever that means), for women.  Fair warning: since we purchase
these luncheons in advance, we will be unable to refund the price of your
lunch if the Club finds you in violation of the dress code.

We will attempt to record this meeting and put it on the web in RealAudio
format at some future date

We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or, if we *really*
know you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by
Saturday, November 29, or you won't be on the list for lunch.  Checks
payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will have to be
sent back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The Harvard
Club of Boston", in the amount of $32.50. Please include your e-mail
address, so that we can send you a confirmation

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've
had to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for instance),
please let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something
out.

Upcoming speakers for DCSB are:

January   Joseph Reagle        "Social Protocols": Meta-data
                                 and Negotiation in Digital Commerce
February  Donald Eastlake      SET


We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on
the first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a
presentation to the Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program
Commmittee, care of Robert Hettinga, <mailto: rah@shipwright.com> .
