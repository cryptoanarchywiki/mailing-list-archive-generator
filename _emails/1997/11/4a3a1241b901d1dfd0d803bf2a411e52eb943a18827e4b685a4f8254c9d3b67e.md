 Do other list readers agree? How many people would this kill?

It is this kind of support for depraved violence which has poisoned
discourse on this mailing list

This list reeks of death and violence.  Apparently there is no problem
which can't be solved by killing.  Kill the innocents of D.C.  Kill the
children in the day care center in Oklahoma City.  Drop more bombs on
Japan.  Cheer the cold-blooded murder of a government agent.  Kill the
children who scrawl graffiti on your mailbox.

Nothing more than a forged spoof by TruthMangler.

You have no right to set yourself apart from them.  You are as ruthless
and violent as the worst of them.

Now maybe everyone will see what I mean when I say that those on this
list now only stand for guns, violence, threats of terrorism and murder,
racism, homophobia.
