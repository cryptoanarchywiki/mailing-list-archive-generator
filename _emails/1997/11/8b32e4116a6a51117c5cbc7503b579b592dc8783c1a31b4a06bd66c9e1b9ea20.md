Nah - private speech isn't something the President has authority over.
(I'm assuming you mean that kind of executive order, as opposed to
"the folks who run my ISP cut off port 25 by fiat and can cut off crypto
too".)
Besides, about all the PGP SMTP enforcer does is look for
	-----BEGIN PGP ENCRYPTED STUFF-----
or the equivalent binary formats, which is easy for anybody to write a
filter for,
but very tough to scale the average sendmail daemon to look for,
and it's easy enough to steganize your way around (Jon Callas recommends 
using -----BEGIN ZZZ ENCRYPTED STUFF----- to avoid the PGP SMTP filters :-)




				Thanks!
