An almost complete summary of my stance.

But Bill left out the third leg of my tripod, that I expect to wake up some
morning and learn that some major city, perhaps Washington, D.C. has been
nuked or bugged.

And, as I am fond of saying, I doubt I'll shed any tears.

(Which got first twisted into "Tim wants to see D.C. nuked) (possibly
true), and then further mutated into "Tim is involved in a conspiracy to
help terrorists destroy major cities" (possibly true)).

Fortunately for me, none of these legs of the tripod are (yet) illegal,
though I gather from what I saw of several of Hettinga's recent foamings
that he thinks they should be.
