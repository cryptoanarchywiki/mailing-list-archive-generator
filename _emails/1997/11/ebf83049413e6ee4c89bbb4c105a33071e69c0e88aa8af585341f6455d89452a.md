I am pleased to announce that I have added IBM, Gateway 2000, Netscape
Communications, and CISCO to my challenge list.  I started this challenge
last week with Andy Grove.  Now some of Andy's friends also have a chance
to break "CordianPlex", the secure One Time Pad based on the random
arrangement of droppings in my cat's litter box. 
 
None of these companies have ever heard of me, or my insignificant
product, but I think I will put their names in my press release to make me
sound more important to people who haven't a clue.

Name three.
