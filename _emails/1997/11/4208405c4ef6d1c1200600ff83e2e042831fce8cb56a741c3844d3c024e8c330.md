True.  I think the majority of the Hollywood community is on our side
in this one.  Folks likes Clint Eastwood have made a sincere effort to
expose the BATFucks for the thugs they are.  Some of you may recall
that Clint has become a vocal critic of the seige at Waco and spoken
out against it on several occasions.

Yes, imagine having to be related to such a creep.

Though not a panacea, remailers do create some interesting possibilities
for the freedom of expression.
