We in the U.S. are approximately where Germany was in the mid-1930's.  The
Holocaust did not start with anti-Semitic genocide; it started with
abortion.  After abortion became popular, infanticide, euthanasia and
assisted suicide were introduced.  (This is where the U.S. is at; witness
Jack Kevorkian and partial-birth infanticide.)  Once these became popular,
they began to become mandatory for individuals that were or were likely to
become a burden to the state.  After that, expanding the focus to include
Jews, Communists, Gypsies, and other groups on Hitler's shit list was a
trivial exercise.  I believe that the same process that happened in Germany
is at work in the U.S.; it is just progressing at a slower rate.

If there is another civil war in the U.S., I believe that the U.N. will
become involved.  I have been hearing stories of Russian soldiers escorting
trespassers out of the U.N. biosphere zones of various national parks for
several years now.  American soldiers may have pangs of conscience when
ordered to fire on fellow Americans, but Russian or Chinese soldiers most
likely wouldn't.  Perhaps acquiring East Bloc weapons isn't such a bad idea
after all if you can steal compatible equipment from the enemy...
