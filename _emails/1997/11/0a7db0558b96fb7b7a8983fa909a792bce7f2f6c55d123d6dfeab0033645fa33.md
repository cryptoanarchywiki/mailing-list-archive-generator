All of the non-exportable ones sound like specialized cryptographic devices,
which are of course evil threats to Yankee National Security,
so of course they're not exportable.  On the other hand, if they weren't
crypto-specific, but just did modexps or other bignum stuff,
as long as they weren't faster than a PentiumII-400, 
and didn't use the C-word in the product literature, they'd be exportable.
