I played around with Hotmail recently, and I didn't pick up any new cookies 
in my cookies file.  The only distinguishing information that Hotmail seems 
to collect (aside from the demographic info you feed them when you open an 
account) is the IP address you log in from.  A public proxy is sufficient to 
shield your IP address.  I created the account from one IP address and sent 
the email during a separate session from another IP address.  The 
X-Originating-IP header showed only the second address.  I don't know if 
Hotmail keeps track of all IP addresses that access each account.

Question: can anyone suggest some information/studies regarding the security 
of public proxies?

Thanks.
