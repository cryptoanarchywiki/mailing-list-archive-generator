Tomorrow's Bay Area Cypherpunks meeting will be held at the offices of
C2Net Software in Oakland.

Agenda:
o Andrea Liles will present some cool new ideas about virtual CA's.

o Lucky Green will demonstrate the Dumb Mouse, a universal chipcard
reader, and associated analysis/manipulation software. If you are at all
interested in smartcards, especially smartcards for crypto and
authentication purposes, you don't want to miss this one. If there aren't
too many attendees, we will host a workshop. Attendees are encouraged to
bring any smartcards in their possession and discover what is /really/
happening on the card. The Cypherpunks Smartcard Developers Association
will accept smartcard donations after the workshop.

o Cypherpunks Tonga will announce the release of BSAFEeay, a BSAFE 3.0 API
compatible crypto library based on SSLeay.

o Cypherpunks Tonga will then combine BSAFEeay with the freeware SETref
(which requires BSAFE for the underlying crypto) and demonstrate the first
ever globally available *freeware* SET solution.
