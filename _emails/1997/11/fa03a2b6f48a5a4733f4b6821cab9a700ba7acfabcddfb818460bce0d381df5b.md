One benefit of making your living through a wire is that your end of
the wire can be anywhere you like.  So, if you want to be surrounded
exclusively by members of Group X, you are free to go live in some
commune populated exclusively with the members of that group and still
make a living.

To the extent that racism is caused by ignorance, the Net will tend to
reduce it.  But, is this claim really correct or is it simply a slur
against racists?  (The implication being that all U.S. racists live in
the South and that Southerners aren't that smart.)

I believe that many people are racists because they like to be that
way and that more knowledge about other racial groups isn't going to
change that.  Knowledge about someone is not synonymous with liking
them or forming a relationship with them.

The people who are working themselves up into a panic regarding "hate
speech" would appear to agree with me on this point.  What they fear
is that certain ideas will "spread".  That is, as certain people are
exposed to ideas and knowledge they did not have before, they will
become racist or more racist than they already are.  In other words,
there are groups of people who cannot be trusted to think for
themselves.

Oh, you mean the majority group?  The majority group will always
protect its own privileges.  Look how many men are in jail when
compared to women.  Clearly men are an oppressed group. ;-)

Seriously, people like to spend at least some of their time with
people who are a lot like themselves.  This is true of just about
every person on the planet.  A common theme in the United States at
this time is that it is wrong for white males to behave this way, but
it is not wrong for anybody else to behave this way.
