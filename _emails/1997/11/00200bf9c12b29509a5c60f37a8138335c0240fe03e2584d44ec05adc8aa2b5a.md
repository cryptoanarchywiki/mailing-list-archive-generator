        Is there any suggestion as to the first meaning to define
"objectionable"? 

        Of course not. That would limit the number of expense paid trips
around the country definitions the organization paying the bills does not
agree with. 

        "Objectionable" means anyone can write off a pseudo-vacation. And
you do not eveb have to show up for the sessions and interupt the
sightseeing tour.

The 2nd guarantees all the rest.
