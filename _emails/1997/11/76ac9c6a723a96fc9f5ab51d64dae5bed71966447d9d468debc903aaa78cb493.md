Ralph was just on CBS "Up-To-The-Minute", bashing MS....
I think it is running every hour, so you might still be able
to get it on the West Coast.

I wonder though, if all this "Bill-Bashing" is somehow
causing problems in the financial markets. Yet "Bill-Bashing"
in the political sense doesn't seem  to have done that.
hmmmm...

http://uttm.com/drive/  is their site, and there is a RealAudio clip
available for the day owls.....
