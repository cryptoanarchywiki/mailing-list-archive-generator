Please give us some references to your abusive and highly infalmmatory
allegations that the Gov't has followed a pattern of transgression on
the rights of any judaeo-christian-god-fearing-tax-paying-40bit-key-using-honest-law-abiding-citizen.(TM)

Proof Please.  Or at least a more concrete reference to these nebulous
