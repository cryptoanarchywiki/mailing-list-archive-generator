  Anyone that's ever looked at a voting ballot can tell you he
speaks the truth about the forces of organized destruction being
with us forever.

  I've always said that Freedom of Movement was one of the main
reasons for the rapid decline of society. It's all that moving
around that people do between their work desks and their beds
at home that is the problem. Increased use of prison labor has
certainly proven that a War on Movement is a viable option.

  If we allow people to move their money around wherever they
want, as if it is really theirs, then the next thing you know,
they might start doing the things they want with the money
they earn, instead of what they are required to do with it.
  If we allow people to access computers, the organized forces
of destruction will use them to get an education, earn a living,
entertain themselves, and conspire to move around.

  "We" being the elite "across national borders" and "across
national lines"--the elite of the WORLD.
  "Organize ourselves" meaning: creating a NEW ORDER of organized
authority, laws and government.

  I *knew* he was going to mention children a couple more times
after the scare tactics. Am I goddamn *psychic*, or what?

  Translation~~"Only" those who "do the right things" are going to
find the NEW WORLD ORDER future "prosperous" and "interesting."

	BILLION DOLLAR CHALLENGE!!!
  If any of you can read this speech by El Presidante and think of
those who spoke out against the National Socialists, the brownshirts,
the Nazis--at the same time--and not get a shiver down your spine...
  I will give you a check for $1,000,000,000 (postdated Jan 1, 2000).
