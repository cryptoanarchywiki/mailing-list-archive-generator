Switzerland jumps to mind for points 1-3: stable politically, good
economy, and first class medical.  There is a job market, but they're
very restrictive about letting people in, particularly if you might want
a job that a Swiss would do.  It helps if you're rich.

That every reservist has a machine gun at home is well known, but I
don't know what restrictions would be placed on an immigrant.  One of
the safest places I've been, though.

"[American] Bill of Rights" type freedoms may not be as enshrined as in
the US, but on the other hand they often take a more pragmatic aproach
to issues (like drugs).

The taxes are high, as is the cost of living.  There are strong social
programs just about everywhere.  It's landlocked.  Consumerism isn't as
developed there, which translates to poor service and bad selections.

Not perfect, but nice.  I'd feel a lot happier raising kids there than
here in the US.
