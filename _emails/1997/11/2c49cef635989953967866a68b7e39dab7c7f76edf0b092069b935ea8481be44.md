Several people have commented about Bob Hettinga's verbosity,
Thompsonesque writing style, and apparent limitless supply of bubbly
energy.

Sometime ago during a discussion of ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder)
Bob told his story on the list.  He explained that he had had ADD, but
was now on amphetamines to counteract this, and was feeling much
better.  It was quite brave of him to discuss this openly.

I suspect what we are seeing is that the amphetamines are more than
counteracting his putative ADD problems, to the extent that he has
more energy than normal to write long winded Thompsonesque rants, the
content of which could be more clearly expressed in a treatise 1/10th
the size.

Impatience is a useful trait, because it causes one to reconsider the
efficiency of approaches.  Most of us simply don't have the patience
to even read the voluminous posts of Bob's to locate the actual
content amidst the colorful metaphors (rocket launchers, snot covered
gun barrels, etc).

No offense to Bob, but I think his effectiveness would improve if he
let off the amphetamines a touch.
