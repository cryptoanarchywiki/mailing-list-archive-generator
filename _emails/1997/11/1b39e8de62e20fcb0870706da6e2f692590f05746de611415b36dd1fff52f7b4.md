Cute, Gary.  Hide the evidence, then challenge people later on to produce it.

You're so sure that just because you hide all your posts behind that 
"X-No-Archive" header and had DejaNews remove all of your old posts from their 
archives that no one can hold you accountable for the numerous false charges
you've made in the past?  Maybe you can find a job cataloging video tapes of
campaigning fund-raising events for the White House.  Your selective memory
might be put to good use, there.  <g>

Perhaps you've conveniently forgotten about this accusation you posted:

In fact, just to really smear Ron, you posted the article twice.  The
second copy was identified as follows:

> Message-ID:   <gburnoreE5rxJ6.FFt@netcom.com>

This allegation was based on a supposed anonymous message to an anonymous
"victim" at DataBasix, and people are supposed to believe that Ron Guilmette
was responsible for it despite that you've posted, to borrow your own words,
"not a shred of evidence".
