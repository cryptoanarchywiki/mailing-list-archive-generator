There were only a few obscure points.  Most of it can be determined from
hex dumps of the files produced.  I had public key management before I saw
the source code.  Since I have a version that does not use any PGP source,
but PGP 5.x interoperates fully, I think I can tell precisely what it is
doing.

There is that section for CAK in a future expansion note in Vol. 1 of the
source.  There is probably a note in the CP archives I posted eons ago,
long before the 5.5 controversy spawned all the traffic about CAK.  It was
near the new passphrase hash which was one thing I could not figure out
without the source.

C is not part of the problem, people who aren't good at abstraction are.
It would look even more horrid in modula-2(3?).  If you have something go
through three layers instead of one, it will be more complicated, for
instance I did something more like:

*hashstart[]() = {md5start,sha1start,ripemd160start};

instead of the layering.
