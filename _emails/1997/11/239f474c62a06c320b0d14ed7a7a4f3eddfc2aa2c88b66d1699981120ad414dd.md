Dave,
  You must be a boonie-dweller, like myself. I live in an area where,
if I lose my account, I have no options. It amazes me that I have been
able, thus far, to send thinly veiled death threats to world leaders
and The Richest Man in the US (TM) without being 'killed or caught.'

  For all of the 'dire predictions' that we hear about terrorists, etc.,
I find it amazing that systems such as those you mention are not
disabled
at will by these alleged 'enemies of mankind', despite their obvious
vulnerability. Could it possibly be that The Enemy (TM) is dancing with
our Protectors (TM) in a reality-spoof that consists of
behind-the-scenes
Puppeteers pulling our strings?

  The (successful) attempts of grey-shrouded background entities to
launch attacks on Tim May, the CypehrPunks list, etc., have given many
of those I communicate with privately cause to believe that it may be
time for The Movement (TM) to move underground, once again.
  What is interesting is that, for all of my paranoid, conspiratorial
rantings, I am only a fool making light parody of the true dark forces
which are operating in the background of our reality. Anyone who thinks
I jest about this might want to get a second opinion from Jim Bell...

  After cleaning up my Sympatico web site, I will send you the
information you need to access it. Feel free to use it as a temporary
solution to your space constraints, but keep in mind that it may well
be yanked at any moment.
  Perhaps someone with a direct InterNet connection will be able to
provide you with the needed cyberspace.
  To me, *you* are one of the "Heroes of the Revolution," as are all
of the remailer operators, Eternity Server developers, and slant-eyed
schills such as Joichi Ito, who are trying to make the best of a bad
situation (TM) in an attempt to move toward a goal which is very
likely improbable, impossible, or just plain inexplicable.

As the 'Youth in Asia Society' says: "Kill The President!"
