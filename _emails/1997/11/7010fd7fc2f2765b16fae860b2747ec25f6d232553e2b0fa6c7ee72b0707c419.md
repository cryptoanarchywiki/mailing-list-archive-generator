Exactly. You have not posted the source code to your allegedly secure crypto
algorithm, so every serious cryptographer will laugh at you.  Without
independent verification, and lots of it, the only people who will consider
your product are lobotomized IT departments.  We've never heard of you
before; we don't even know who your developers are, so we can only assume
they haven't "done their homework."

In essence: you have now been branded as complete morons. The only way to
avoid having to leave the country is to make the complete source for your
crypto available on your website in the next   24 hours.  Noncompliance will
lead to your mysterious reciept of a suitcase, followed shortly by the
mysterious disappearance of a large portion of your city.
