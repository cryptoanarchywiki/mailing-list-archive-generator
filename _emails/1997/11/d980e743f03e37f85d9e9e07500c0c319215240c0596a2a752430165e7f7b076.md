On a somewhat related issue Eduardo Kac from the Chicago Art Institute
last week sucessfully implanted a microchip under his skin.  This is
much more of a "dumb" chip as it simply can report back an ID number
when queried and doesn't really have any sensing or processing.
However, it is notable because it was done by a non-medical individual
on his own accord and at least shows that implants are becoming a more
accessable to the common person.  Now only what to do about that
heatsink...  More info here:
