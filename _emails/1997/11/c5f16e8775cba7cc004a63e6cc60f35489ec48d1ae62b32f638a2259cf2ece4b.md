o There is typically an exemption in license agreements for distribution of
software that charges nominal media costs. If PGP overlooked this, it can
be added trivially. No need to get excited about it.

o The current license agreement for the PGPsdk is for use freeware only.
The license agreement for shareware has not yet been made public (=been
written).
