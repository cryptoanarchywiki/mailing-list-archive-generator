Woops.  Saw this one last night. This one's actually written after "Common
Sense". It's from "On the Present(or American?) Crisis" or something, which
was actually written in camp, just before Washington crossed the Deleware
and started his first counteroffensive. See? The People's Television
Network's good for something. Clocks right twice a day, and all that...
