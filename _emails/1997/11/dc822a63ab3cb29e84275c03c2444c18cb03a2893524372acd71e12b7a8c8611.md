First of all, you're the first person I've seen with a Niue address -
congratulations!  (South Pacific Island suburb of Lompoc :-)

The legal status of crypto-equipment-without-the-crypto-plugin is
fuzzier under the current regime than the previous one, but it was
basically illegal to export components of a cryptosystem.

You answered that correctly later:

So don't export that crypto-cellphone - export a phone with
voice amplifier software implemented as a plugin, 
or a digital background noise reducer,
or programmable muzak-on-hold replacement, or
or even enhanced authentication protocols.
They're not crypto devices, they're perfectly normal commercial products,
and you're shocked, _shocked_ at the free scratchy-white-noise background
music plugin that somebody with entirely no musical taste is shipping,
or that some Bulgarian hackers are abusing your phone to provide service
to Colombian narcoterroristas in blatant violation of their warranty.
				Thanks!
