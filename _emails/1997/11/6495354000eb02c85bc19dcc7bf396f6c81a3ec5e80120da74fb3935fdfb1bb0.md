You admit here that you've said you hope to see D.C. nuked.

Do you really hope that D.C. gets nuked?  Do other list readers agree?
How many people would this kill?  Over half a million live in the city
proper, with millions more in the surrounding areas.  You have now said
that you would hope to see many of these millions of people killed.

It is this kind of support for depraved violence which has poisoned
discourse on this mailing list.  It is unconscionable to support such
an act of cold-blooded terrorism.

You're not even the worst.  Other posters have supported this kind of
sickening violence even more openly.  No one complains.  Apparently
everyone with an ounce of moral sense has left the list long ago.

You seem to think that the only problem with Waco is that the wrong
innocents were killed.  You have no problem taking out innocents
in Washington D.C. if it lets you get at your enemies.  You are no
different from the agents who killed the men, women and children in Waco.
You have no right to set yourself apart from them.  You are as ruthless
and violent as the worst of them.

This list reeks of death and violence.  Apparently there is no problem
which can't be solved by killing.  Kill the innocents of D.C.  Kill the
children in the day care center in Oklahoma City.  Drop more bombs on
Japan.  Cheer the cold-blooded murder of a government agent.  Kill the
children who scrawl graffiti on your mailbox.

Of course you have the right to post what you like.  But when you spew
garbage, I have the right to say it stinks.  It seems that other posters
have lost their sense of smell.  They say that's what happens when you
spend your time wallowing in sewage.
