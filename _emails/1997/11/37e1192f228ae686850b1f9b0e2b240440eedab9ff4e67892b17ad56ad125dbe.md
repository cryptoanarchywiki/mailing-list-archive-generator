There is an old saying in the Security Field: "Poor Security is worse than
no security at all".

I doubt that you would find few if any that would agree with you that it
is a good thing having the masses using weak crypto. At least the US
members of the Open-PGP group are willing to sacrifice overseas sales in
the effort to provide STRONG crypto to EVERYONE. It is the right thing to
do. I am sorry to see that you do not uderstand this. 

If you choose to dance with the Devil to line your pockets that is your
choice but don't expect me to recomend that anyone join in with you.
