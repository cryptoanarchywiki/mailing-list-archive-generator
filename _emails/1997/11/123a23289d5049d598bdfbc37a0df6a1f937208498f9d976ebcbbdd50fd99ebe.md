If the CMOS chip is socketed (as opposed to soldered in), remove it, wrap
it in aluminum foil, and let it sit for about an hour.  This will clear all
CMOS data including the password, hard drive parameters, date/time, and
other settings maintained there.  If removing the chip is impractical,
unplug the power supply from the motherboard, and remove the battery that
powers the chip.  (Even if it is soldered in, desoldering a 2-pin device is
orders of magnitude easier than desoldering a 40-60 pin DIP)  Once you have
done this, wait for an hour.  When time is up, put everything the way it
was, start the machine, enter the setup program (F1/F10/DEL) and redo all
the settings.  Hopefully, you have them archived with Norton Utilities or
something similar sou you needn't try to remember if you had enabled the
BIOS shadowing at 0xC8000 and other such trivia.
