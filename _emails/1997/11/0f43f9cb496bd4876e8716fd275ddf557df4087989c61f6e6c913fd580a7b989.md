Let's say you are James Joyce and you are writing "Ulysses" on your
nice little Linux machine.  Because you fear persecution, you use
encrypted virtual disks.

Because you are clever, you have ten such disks.  One contains your
drafts of "Ulysses", four contain harmless information, and five
contain noise.

The jack booted thugs kick down your door and drag you to jail.  The
Judge orders you to produce the pass phrases of all the disks or be
penalized for contempt of court.

Now, you are in an interesting situation.  You can't give the
passwords for half of the disks, but you are unable to prove this.
This means you have nothing to gain by giving the pass phrase to the
"Ulysses" disk - you will always be seen as holding out.  Even if you
convince the Judge that some of the disks are noise, you have no
reason not to include the "Ulysses" disk in this set.
