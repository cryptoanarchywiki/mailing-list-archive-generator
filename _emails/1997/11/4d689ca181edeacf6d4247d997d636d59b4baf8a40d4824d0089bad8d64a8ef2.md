1. IMO, robust debate is the source of new ideas.  New and worthwhile
ideas are often shocking.  For example, the music by Bach, Beethoven,
the Beatles, and even the Sex Pistols were all shocking in their time.

2. Attacks on your posts only lower your reputation if the attacks
have substance.  Tim May has been attacked more than anybody else on
the list for years.  His reputation capital is doing just fine.

3. Use of remailers simplifies True Name reputation management.
