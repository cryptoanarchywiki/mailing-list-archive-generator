The purpose is to create a persistent nym.  The signature, and public key
ensures that you know that this message is from the same person as you were
attempting to nit pick :-]

True.  So it's only as good as the keys you might fetch from a keyserver
that you have no connection to in the web of trust.

You aren't supposed to link it to my True Name.

All that can be done is to get a signature from a timestamp server, and a
signature from Bill Stewart's nym key signing service.

I don't think there are any timestamp servers which provide key signatures.

Anyone want to start one?

This is important because it prevents someone else from generating more
keys with the same userID, such as happened with Tim May's blacknet key.
The only protection I have against that is the public record of my key
being posted to cypherpunks.  The http://infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks/
archive helps as a public record of first publishing of a key with this
userID.

A timestamp service signature on my key would be a better solution.
