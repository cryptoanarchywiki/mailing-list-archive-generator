	There would have been something else to cause them sorrow and 
dejection. 
	Then think of the thinks that we aquired during WW1. Weren't 
sulfates invented during that war? Also advances in Metallurgy and 
avaition.

	Communism was already around. IIRC Mr. Marx wrote his manifesto
during the 1800's.

	And sparing us from further development in the areas of Aviation,
and medicine as well as radio & cryptography. Weather predection &etc.

	Doubtful. If those millions had survived, and reproduced, then 
there would me more people to share somewhat limited resources. Also,
WWII gave us the GI Bill, which allowed many people who otherwise wouldn't
have had the funds or time to persue college educations. It also was a 
major factor in the womens liberation movement. 

> Here I am afraid we disagree.  The world has too many damned leaders!

	Nope. Not enough. Not until everyone is there own leader will
we have enough leaders.
