The IFEA press conference at 12:30 pm Monday will be carried by CSPAN for
you outside-the-Bway-folks. One or two libertarian thinktanks may make
available some material critical of the push towards mandatory voluntary
ratings. The IFEA folks will also, I'm told, have someone at the Censorware
Summit hotel itself, on Tuesday, in Meeting Room #6 on the lower level.
