* In March in Huntsville, Tenn., the wife of state Rep. Les
Winningham was indicted for assault.  During the election campaign
in November 1996, according to police, the Winninghams pulled
over in their van to confront a woman who was wearing a shirt that
indicated support for Winningham's opponent.  After a heated
argument, according to the victim, Mr. Winningham instructed his
wife to rough her up, whereupon Mrs. Winningham punched her
three times and kicked her.
