My main point in my post was about the "clampdown on civil liberties" after
the dual "terrorist incidents" of Flight 800 and Richard Jewell, and how
those liberties are not being given back to us now that the crash of Flight
800 has been ruled a non-terrorist attack.

Analysis of the missile theory was not my main thrust.

There's always a chance it _was_ a missile, or a bomb, or somesuch. I don't
see compelling evidence. The CIA reconstruction looked quite complete and
plausible to me.

We can argue for the next 30 years about the vapor trail from the grassy
knoll, but it seems like a wild goose chase to me.

And there are much more substantiated cases of malfeasance. If 1% of the
media attention given to Flight 900 had been given to
Inslaw/Cabazon/Systematics and the Octopus/Casolaro/Contras mess, much more
useful things would be learned. Learned by the American public, that is.

For starters, folks ought to do a Web search on J. Orlin Grabbe, who was on
the Cypherpunks list a couple of years ago. Lots of interesting stuff, and
his articles are getter wider distribution now.
