>From News of the Weird:

* The February Scientific American reported on how conservation
biologist Joel Berger (University of Nevada at Reno) field-studies
moose, which are notoriously unfriendly to humans.  Berger needed
to be able to hurl fresh bear and wolf dung accurately enough to
assure that a moose immediately smelled it, to see if it made the
moose fearful or aggressive.  To be able to get that close to a
moose, he engaged a designer who worked on the movie "Star
Wars" to make a moose suit, which worked so well that Berger said
he spent much of his time in the suit worrying about being
mounted.
