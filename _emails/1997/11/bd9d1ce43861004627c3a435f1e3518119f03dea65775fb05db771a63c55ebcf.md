For Heaven's sake, guys, there were _two_ religious revivals by the name of
the 'Great Awakening'. One in England, early 18thC., most prominent
product: John Wesley & Methodism. The other in this country, at its height
in the 1840's,  with the Church of the Later Day saints as _its_ most
prominent product.
