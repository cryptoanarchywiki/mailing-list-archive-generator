Thanks, I'll check them out as I am unaware of their position.

Actualy, his research is one of the reasons that I am so interested in an
actual lawsuit.

What if somebody were to go for several years with no contact at all with
the IRS, and no intention of making contact. Then when approached that
person makes enough noise to guarantee that they will be going to court.
What would it then take to bush-whack the beggars? What is the absolute last
point that your defence must be revealed prior to your presenting your case
to the jury? The reason I use the first person is because to me it seems
critical that no lawyer is actualy used in the defence. As I understand it,
and I ain't no lawyer, there are some actions that a defendent may do if
representing themselves that lawyers are prohibited from doing. Among them
is stating the obvious fact, if the jurors don't believe the law is just
they may refuse to find for that reason. If the Constitution and the actual
record of votes in concert with the general feeling of excess regarding this
matter doesn't prove the case, what will?
