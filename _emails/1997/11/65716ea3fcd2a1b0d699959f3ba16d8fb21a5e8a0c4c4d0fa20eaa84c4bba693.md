The hardware crypto used by banking networks is universally
underperforming and overpriced. As the leading vendor is losing market
share due to the fact that customers are starting to wonder why they are
paying $5-10k for a device that is outperformed by a Pentium 90, some
enterprising vendor of such devices has aparently convinced the Fed to
help him elimiate  competition by means of regulations. Your basic
government contract con job.
