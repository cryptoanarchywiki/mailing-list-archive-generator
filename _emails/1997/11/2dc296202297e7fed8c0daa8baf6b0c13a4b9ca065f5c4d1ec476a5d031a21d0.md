I did a little web-search (still being at work and deprived of my library)
but what I can find clearly indicates the 'Great Awakening' was fininished
by the mid to late 1750's. Most of the sources that I found from Alta Vista
give the beginning of the Great Awakening as the late 1600's to early
1700's.

While I clearly put the beginning of the movement too early (I always get
this confused with the beacon on the hill jive) all the evidence that I
can gather shows that it did *not* extend into any part of the 1800's.
As I understood the movement it didn't survive the American War of
Indipendance.

I used Alta Vista and search terms of 'great' & 'awakening'.
