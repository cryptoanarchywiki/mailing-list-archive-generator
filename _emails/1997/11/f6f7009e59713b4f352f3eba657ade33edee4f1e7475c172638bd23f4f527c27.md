This doesn't surprise me at all Attila.They don't teach the constitution in
High School anymore. That accounts for the lower ranks. The NCOM's answers
are to be expected, They STRESS Posse Commitais<sp?> and the constitution
for ALL noncom's. It's part of the testing for promotion to E-5 and up.
Most of the noncom's have been in long enough to be thorouly  disillusioned
by the military in general. The only thing keeping a lot of them in is
enertia...
