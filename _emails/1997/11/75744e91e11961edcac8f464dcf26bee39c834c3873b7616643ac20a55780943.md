It used to be, that people are "felons under an increasing number
of laws". Now we've congressed to an "increasing number of felons
regardless of what they do" (their "crime" is being from "other
side" of the pencil-lines, that the statists have drawn on their
papers).

Even the "freedom-loving", no-boundaries etc. Cypherpunks fall over
those imaginery "border-lines", without having it ever dawn on
them, that *everything* done now to "illegal immigrants" will one
day soon be extended to the government-issued passport/digital
VeriSign-Tax-ID bearing "Americans" as well.
(Please refer to the "War on Drugs" for proof of patterns.)

In fact, it's being done already. The systems developed to "track
down illegal aliens" can track ANYBODY for that matter.
