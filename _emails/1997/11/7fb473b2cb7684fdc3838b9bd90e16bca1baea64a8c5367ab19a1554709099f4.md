ROTFL!

I look up all of the URLs in the InfoWar Chronicles sent
to the list and I was mystified as to why the one you
just mentioned (http://cuy.net/~einstein/local/malebook.html)
was linked to when I clicked on the word _extortion_.
Now it makes sense. Kinda. Maybe.

If you click on the highlighted text _terrorists steeped in 
extremism and political hatred_ it sends you to whithouse.gov.
When I get one of those chapters when I am too fucked up to
read I just read the highlighted text and see where it goes
and its usually pretty weird.
I wonder if Nobuki charges his _pen pals_ the same price as
he charges cypherpunks. ;P ($50 to have him _play Misty_
for us). ;P
