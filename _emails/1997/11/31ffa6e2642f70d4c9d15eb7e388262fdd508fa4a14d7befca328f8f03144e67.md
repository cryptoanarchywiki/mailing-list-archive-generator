I think it is really cool that a private company can actually negotiate 
somewhat as an equal with a government.  One implication of this is that 
Microsoft is becoming a more powerful corporation - which is not 
necessarily a good thing.

But the other thing it might imply is that the power of government is 
slipping - which is definitely a good thing.
