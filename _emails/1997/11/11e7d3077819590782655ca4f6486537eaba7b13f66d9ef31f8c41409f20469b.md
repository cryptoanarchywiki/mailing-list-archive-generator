That's quite interesting.  Spam is arriving with forged headers that
attempt to implicate "cajones.com".

That domain has quite a colorful history.  According to InterNIC records,
it's operated by Jeff Burchell, who is also the former operator of the
defunct Huge Cajones Remailer which he operated as part of that domain.

Along came Gary Burnore <gburnore@netcom.com>, CEO of DataBasix, who
claimed that Jeff's remailer at cajones.com was being used to "forge"
his e-mail address to Usenet articles.  His only evidence was a few 
messages which happened to have a "cajones.com" message id in the 
headers, and they weren't even very convincing forgery attempts at that. 

Gary Burnore, Belinda Bryan <eridani@ix.netcom.com>, and William J. 
McClatchie (aka "Wotan") <wmcclatc@primenet.com> managed to harass Jeff 
sufficiently that he shut the remailer down.  At the time, Burnore
refused to concede the possibility that any "forgeries" of articles in 
his name might also have forged headers designed to implicate 
"cajones.com" as well.  Rather he relied on the fact that Jeff kept no
logs which could prove the innocence of himself and his remailer.

Now the "cajones.com" domain is dead, and yet it's still showing up in
forged headers!  It looks like another of Gary Burnore's "shoot first
and ask questions later" accusations has been cast into doubt.
Unfortunately, it's probably too late to undo the disinformation
campaign that he waged against Jeff Burchell and other remailer
operators.
