As some of you may know, I have been working on a skunk works project to
further knowledge about smartcards and add smartcard support to crypto
applications. 

While the latter isn't nearly ready for release, the former has resulted
in a number of tools some on this list should find useful. Namely, we have
a truly universal smartcard reader and software. Unlike the proprietary
protocol garbage the smartcard vendors will sell you for lots of cash
together with their overpriced toolkits, our reader uses only ISO
standards and can handle *any* smartcard. 

In addition, we developed drivers and fully-automated scanning 
software for UNIX and Win32. If you don't get results just by
typing "scan", then whatever you inserted isn't a smartcard.  :-) 

At this time, we need sample smartcards and documentation. Anonymous
donations of both is encouraged. For more information, please see

All questions/offers should be directed to scard-admin@cypherpunks.to
