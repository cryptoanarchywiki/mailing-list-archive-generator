        If he is charging $60, I will do it for them for $50. For $40 I
will sell detailed instructions. For $30 I well tell them about attrib /h. 

        For free it tell how not to be individually tracked. I do not think
my prices are out of line. 

        If people are worried about more than individual tracking, they are
doing things that they should not be doing with a browser in the first place.

The 2nd guarantees all the rest.
