This is nothing but selfserving bullshit in a vain effort to justify YOUR
sellout for a paycheck.


Your product will use WEAK RC2/40 DOMESTICALLY as long as it is
communicating with someone useing these weak keys. How does your program
warn the user that the crypto being used is unacceptable?? Does it warn
them at all?? Does it refuse to use the WEAK crypto?? I know I get no
warning from NS if weak keys are being used, just the happy key to tell me
everything is ok. Do you see this as a GoodThing(TM)?? WEAK crypto is WEAK
crypto and should not be tolerated in any way shape or form. 

Having a minimum baseline of weak crypto is not a GoodThing(TM) it is a
BadThing(TM). If the people at Entrust can't figure that out then I have
serious question as to the security and quality of your product regardless
of the algorthims being used!!

PS: Please learn how to set up your mailer so that it quotes properly.
<sigh> one would think that someone in this business could grasp such
basic concepts.
