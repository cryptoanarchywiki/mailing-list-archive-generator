* John E. Herndon, at his May sentencing (he got 20 years) in Little
Rock, Ark., for using two teenage girls in pornographic photos
after giving them alcoholic beverages:  "They were my muffins and
my flowers," he told the judge.  "They were earth angels.  I renew
my promises to the girls as a born-again Christian that I will always
love them and protect them."
