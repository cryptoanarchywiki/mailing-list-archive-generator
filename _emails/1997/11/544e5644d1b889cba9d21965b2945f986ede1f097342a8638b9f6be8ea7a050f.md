Yep. Or, as Bob likes to say:

"Well, spank me dry. I do feel like I've got a "kick me" sign on my back or
something.... Ding! You rang? Welcome to Random Acts of Kindness, Inc....I
do think my own powers of hucksterism are improving, though.... I just blew
Diet Coke out of my nose again."

Yes. Bob claims to be an "ex-liberal," but he shows himself to be just
another bleeding heart, there-ought-to-be-a-law, simp wimp.

And, hackneyed though this may sound, I didn't even _start_ this thing! In
fact, the last few major "Bob vs. Tim" wars have been triggered solely by
Bob. He got overexercised that I didn't care to give a "keynote" at his Mac
Crypto cheerleading party, and wrote a vicious, over the top, rant that
even Lucky Green reacted to by saying "Get back on your Ritalin!"

This rant, called "Watching the MacRubble Bounce" (or somesuch) viciously
attacked me. And also one of his business associates, a thinly veiled
longtime Cypherpunk.

I mostly skip Hettinga's "e$-rants," as they are long on "creative writing"
chops, or so he thinks, and short on substance.

Yep, again. Ugly things are in the wind. Hettinga can rant about his
"geodesic economies," but the clampdowns are continuing. Too many to list
here.

I am still hopeful, longterm, but we may have to go through some dark,
ugly, periods of war. And in this war, we know who the enemy is.
