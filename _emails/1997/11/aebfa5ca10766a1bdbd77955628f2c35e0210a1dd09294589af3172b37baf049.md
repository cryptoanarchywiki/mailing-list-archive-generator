I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe. 
He's not dead, he's electroencephalographically challenged.

misquoted, then used against you.
I wonder how much deeper would the ocean be without sponges.
Despite the cost of living, have you noticed how it remains so popular? 
Nothing is foolproof to a sufficiently talented fool.
Atheism is a non-prophet organization. 
He who laughs last, thinks slowest.
