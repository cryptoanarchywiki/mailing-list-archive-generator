* Life Imitates TV: (1) A Bangkok hotel worker was convicted in
July of stealing from guests' safe-deposit boxes by rubbing his nose
oil onto the buttons so he could check later to see which buttons
had been pushed by the guest to open the safe.  He said he learned
the trick from watching the TV show "MacGyver."
