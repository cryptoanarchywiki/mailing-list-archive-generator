This arrangement has analogs in the real world.  When a doctor sells
his practice, the patients are all notified.  But, I think there are
some True Name issues.  The doctor tends to assure the patients that
he has carefully selected the new doctor.  People know the doctor and
as a consequence tend to believe him.

This isn't really true of an anonymous persistent identity.  Let's say
it was doing a significant amount of business.  If you knew that its
ownership had changed, you might hesitate before doing a deal which
had a lot of fraud exposure.

On the other hand, the purchaser of the identity has an investment
which he may not want to endanger.  If the identity cost $1 million
and the outstanding deals only amounted to $100,000, fraud would be a
bad deal for the owner.

One reason why trading anonymous identities is a good idea is that it
baffles pursuit.  Every time you use one, information is revealed.
Even if you are doing things like transmitting 100K to the remailers
every hour, from time to time your net connection will go down, or
whatever, and increase the odds that The Enemy will have a more
accurate picture of your True Name.  (This works best if the
transaction is handled privately.)

But, if the persistent identity starts operating from someplace else,
it makes those attacks quite a bit more difficult, especially if there
is no public announcement regarding the change of ownership.

The transaction makes sense even if two identities of equal value are
traded.

After using one persistent identity for awhile, you become emotionally
attached to it!)
