Ad hominem becomes you, Bob.

A variation of the old "get a life" put down of anyone whose opinions one
disagrees with.

So we're back to the old "if we won't restrain our opinions, Reno and Freeh
will have to."

I say what I think. Not all of it publically.

Recently I was using my ComSec 3DES phone to talk privately (with one of
those rare persons, according to Bob, that I talk to outside of the Net)
with someone. He sent me later saying, "Nice talking to you this evening
(afternoon, for you) and nice to be able to speak freely. What used to be
taken for granted is now a
luxury. <sigh>"

Truer words were never spoken. Wiretaps, anti-terrorism task forces,
political prisoners in Washington state, Roby Rudge, Ruby Ridge, Waco, bans
on discussion of chemicals and bombs, and on and on.

More over the top nonsense from Bob. I've done nothing that will "force a
showdown." Precisely what crimes, Bob, have I committed? Cite a charge.
Even a single one.

More typical Bob Hettinga insult arguments. You ought to form a club with
Kent Crispin, Detweiler, and Vulis.

You want to document a case where I've shoved a Mac-10 up anyone's nose,
let alone a tree hugger?

Or is talking now the same as shoving a gun in someone's nose? (You'd be
surprised how many liberals think this is so, even some judges who just
ruled against Evil Assault Literature.)

I don't form or express my opinions to have you like me more than these
fiction characters you're obsessed with.

Get a life, Bob.
