* On August 7, police in Delaware, Ohio, and Thibodaux, La.,
reported that alleged child molesters had received private justice. 
According to police in Ohio, the wife and mother-in-law of
Rodney Hosler, 27, kidnapped him shortly after he was released
from prison on child-molesting charges, tied him up, shaved his
body, applied hot ointment to his genitals, inserted a cucumber
into his body, scribbled "I am a child molester" on him, and
dumped him naked in front of a pizza parlor in his home town,
70 miles away.
