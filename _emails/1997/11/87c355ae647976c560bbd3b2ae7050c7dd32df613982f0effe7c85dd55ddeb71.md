It has been my experience that it is more fun to operate a persistent
identity than to post unsigned and unverifiable messages.

Providing the key is at least a convenience for people who don't have
it already - it saved me a trip to the key server.

What would be really nice is if the mailing list machines time stamped
messages.

There was a discussion a little while ago suggesting that toad.com had
been compromised by people who were sowing dissension by partially
distributing certain messages.  Had toad signed all of its messages,
it would be possible to obtain evidence supporting this hypothesis
without relying entirely on the word of people we may not know.

Had somebody compromised toad, they would still have to correctly sign
messages.  Later it would have been possible to prove this had
occurred by comparing messages and signatures.

This would also prevent an attack where somebody forges mail from a
cypherpunks list machine to flush out identities.  If the attacker
sends a unique message to every person, he or she will be able to
break an identity if the message is replied to on the list.

I'm not sure a timestamp matters that much for "authenticating" your
key.  After all, you don't own "Amad3us", you own key 0x4D162BBE1.

If another "Amad3us" shows up, what matters if their string of posts
are worth reading, not whether they borrowed your handle.

It would cause confusion, but since the cypherpunks are so good at
slinging bits, we should be able to handle this.  It might even have
an advantage: reporters and secret police types will have a harder
time dealing with the cypherpunks without adopting some of our
technology and ideas and sharing them with others.
