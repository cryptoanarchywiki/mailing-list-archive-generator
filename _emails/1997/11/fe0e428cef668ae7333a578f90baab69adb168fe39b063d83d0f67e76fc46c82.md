>      
>      GENEVA (AP) -- Concerned at the growing use of the Internet for
>      racist propaganda, international experts are debating how -- and
>      whether -- to combat the spread of computerized hate messages.
>      
>      Binding global controls on the Internet are unlikely, officials said
>      Tuesday, since the technology is changing faster than rules can be
>      made, and because of free speech protection in the United States.
>      
>      The United Nations is sponsoring a week-long meeting of human rights
>      activists, government officials and Internet service providers as
>      part of efforts to ensure compliance with an international treaty
>      banning racial discrimination. It ends Friday with a list of
>      recommendations.
>      
>      "There are 148 countries who have accepted this convention and they
>      are under obligation to enact measures to implement it," said Agha
>      Shahi of Pakistan, a member of the U.N. Committee on the Elimination
>      of Racial Discrimination.
>      
>      "Are we going to say the Internet should be exempt from any kind of
>      compliance with the rules of international behavior?" he asked.
>      
>      It is widely agreed that the Internet offers an open platform for
>      racists and white supremacists, although nothing has proved this
>      leads to a related rise in racist incidents.
>      
>      Much of the problem stems from the United States, where groups such
>      as the Ku Klux Klan, the Aryan Nations and skinheads base their Web
>      sites.
>      
>      Under the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees free speech, these
>      groups are permitted to post their views on the Internet, which can
>      be accessed by people in other countries.
>      
>      Although European countries like Sweden have moved toward making
>      Internet service providers responsible for the content they supply,
>      such restrictions are unlikely in the United States, and hence,
>      internationally.
>      
>      "In our tradition, it is only through the clash of views in vigorous
>      debate, and not through government censorship, that equality is well
>      served," Philip Reitinger of the U.S. Department of Justice said at
>      the U.N. meeting. "That principle -- one which accords freedom of
>      expression the highest respect -- applies with equal force to the
>      Internet."
>      
>      While the U.S. computer industry is voluntarily working on ways to
>      ensure that computer smut isn't accessible to minors, Eric Lee, of
>      the Internet service provider Commercial Internet eXchange, said it
>      was "not feasible and not desirable" for Internet providers to act
>      as censors.
>      
>      "It's difficult if not impossible to suppress content on the Web
>      because there are so many ways to evade controls," Lee said. "Which
>      does not mean that one should not take steps to limit behavior, but
>      coming up with foolproof controls is virtually impossible."
