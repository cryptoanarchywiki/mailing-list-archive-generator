As computer programs for analyzing and generating natural language improve,
there's a lot that can be automated, though stylometry does give away which
rewriters you commonly use, the way typewriter differences used to generate clues.
There are crude examples today, like Jive and Valspeak,
and you probably wouldn't want to use a Zippyfier on your ecommerce

	I'm eating 33 bushels of soybean futures! Yow!
Also, I'm sure there will be freelance writing coaches out there on the net,
who make a business of editing, and who'll be happy to take your
grody Valley-Accent writing and help you write proper formal business jargon,
and if you're giving them the already robo-rewritten text, that's pretty secure.

Also, formal grammars, such as EDI, often constrain the expressiveness of 
commercial communications, reducing the need for obfuscation.
