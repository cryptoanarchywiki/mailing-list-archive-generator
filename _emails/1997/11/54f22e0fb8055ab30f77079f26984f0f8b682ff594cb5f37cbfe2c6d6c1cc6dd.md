                     FRANKLIN, Tennessee (AP) --
                     Three books by photographers
                     Jock Sturges and David Hamilton
                     have received some critical praise,
                     but a Tennessee county grand jury
                     claims they may violate state
                     obscenity laws. 

                     "The Age of Innocence" by
                     Hamilton and "The Last Day of Summer" and "Radiant
Identities"
                     by Sturges were cited in the indictment against
Barnes & Noble's
                     Brentwood store. 

                     The obscenity charges focus on photographs of nude
children in
                     the books. 

I certainly hope that the prosecutor, judge and jury didn't look
at those pictures. Probably turn them all into pedophiles, eh?

                     Barnes & Noble was served with a summons to appear
in
                     Williamson County Criminal Court on December 1.
Jerome
                     Melson, an attorney for the Tennessee Press
Association, said
                     interpretations of what is obscene vary widely and
he believes the
                     grand jury is not looking to put anyone in jail. 

                     "They're probably just looking for a fine... to get
the bookstore to
                     change its manner," he said. "In other words,
change your shelves."

Oh! Voluntary/Mandatory under threat of imprisonment...

Is it time for some new NewSpeak?
   Volundated -- Voluntary/Mandated
   Volundatory -- Voluntary/Mandatory
   Volutelse -- Voluntary/Or else!
