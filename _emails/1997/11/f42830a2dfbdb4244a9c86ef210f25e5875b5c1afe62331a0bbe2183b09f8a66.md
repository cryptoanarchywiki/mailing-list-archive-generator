Its hard to tell.  However PGP has a number of advangers over S/MIME,
it is better supported by cilents, PGP signtures are smaller then S/MIME
sigs.  In addtion S/MIME sigs normaly have encoded in them a lot of
infomation about the user makeing it very difficalt to use via an anon
remailer.

Please excuse my spelling as I suffer from agraphia see the url in my header. 
Never trust a country with more peaple then sheep. 
Save the ABC Is $0.08 per day too much to pay?   ex-net.scum and proud
