Vinnie M. sent me a note also saying this. I guess the Eastern European
stuff is available--for now.

Some in the gun community are vilifying Olyarms for introducing this OA-93
"assault pistol" (the name often applied to politically incorrect pistols
like this). As if Olyarms should have been cowed into not introducing a
product out of fear that Clinton would abuse his authority to ban Chinese
ammo.

I've never owned anything in 7.62x39. I hear the SKS rifles are pretty good
for $150, or whatever, and a lot of people have bought them. To me they
look a little crude. And since I can afford things out of the AR-15 line....

(Debate rages in rec.guns and elsewhere about the relative merits of the
cartridges. I certainly see more variants of the AR-15 here in America,
more use by tactical and law enforcement teams, and more accessories. But
maybe I'm not looking in the right places.)

One of the more interesting images I ever saw was a photo in one of the gun
mags of a friendly meeting in the U.S. between Eugene Stoner, principal
designer of the AR-15 (the M-16 in its military version) and Mikhail
Kalashnikov, whose name needs no further explanation.

I suppose tree-hugging peaceniks would be aghast at a meeting between these
two merchants of death. I, being an antigovernment type, was nevertheless
impressed.
