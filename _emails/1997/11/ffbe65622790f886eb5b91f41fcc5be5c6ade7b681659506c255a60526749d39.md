It's true, Officer Law, Jim and me did associate, here, and still at it, here, 
with our freely assembled, disputatious co-conspirators and moles.

My photo's with Jim's, officer, because he in a jam and isolated, and he's 
being flaunted by the news story to boost the campaign to intimidate and 
isolate all us. Bet you think that's great fun, officer.

So I confess, officer, that I'm an associate of Jim Bell whether I want to be 
or not. Confirmed by an IRS letter saying so, sent four times. 

Your news story, officer, aims to frighten us to hunker in an isolation of fear 
that it could be any of us being mugged by officers of law, awaiting penalty, 
indefinitely. To warn us to cooperate, behave, pay tithe, recant, beg for 
mercy.

That shit sucks, officer, made me want to join Jim's lineup, nightmare your
babies with my guilty puss.
