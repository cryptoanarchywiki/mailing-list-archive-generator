TruthMonger Terrestrial Translation:
The FTC, fearing loss of its dictatorial powers over the information
that citizens are allowed and not allowed to access, wants the citizens
to do its legwork for them so that they can step forward to 'save' us
all from people who use herbs instead of nuclear radiation to maintain
their health.

You remember the FTC, don't you? They are those wonderfolks who gave
us the 'mainstream media' that used the citizen's airwaves to read
us the spoon-fed government propaganda during the Gulf War.

In other news: That pesky Sadaam Hussein is acting up again, as he
always
does during US elections. Funny how the Democrats always come out of
wars with Sadaam looking bad, and CIA-backed Republicans always come
out looking good.

Note to Clinton: You're a Democrat. If you try to show-off in the Gulf,
  all of your helicopters are going to crash.
