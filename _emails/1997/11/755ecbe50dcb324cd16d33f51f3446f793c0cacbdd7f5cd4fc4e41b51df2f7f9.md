Thank someones god/shaman/whatever that we don't live in a tribal
society.  The whole reason money was invented was so that we could
"buy" the services we needed.  The invention of the firearm was so
that anyone could protect the campsite.

Whenever tribes go beyond a few hundred/thousand members barter
becomes hopelessly inefficient and pretty shells/rocks/silver/gold
becomes the next best thing.  This becomes a civilization.  Hopefully
its a limited constitutional representative democracy.  Thats democracy
in the old sense of republic, not in the new sense which is newspeak for
"socialism".

Unfortunately the essense of money is not a subject that is taught
in grade schools, high schools or university economics courses for
that matter.  Prices are information that indicate demand/supply
and money is the packetized communication medium of free association.
Anyone know of any monetary theories based on communication theory?

Does income-side taxation then constitute a limitation on free
association?  Does it limit the people who you could cooperate
with to build a car?  Negotiate a deal?  Rent a hall so that you could
discuss politics?

Isnt that a breech of the 1st amendment?  Freedom of assembly?

Is income taxation an a-priori limitation on free speech and association?

Wow.  I've got to either lay off the caffiene or (tm) that theory.

Disclaimer:

All of the above discussion has been strictly theoretical.  Any
imputed relation to Jim Burnes' theories and ideas are strictly
coincidental.

Even if this were really coming from Jim Burnes, I'm sure he would
not want to be the Chief Taxation Spokesman^h^h^hperson.
