Let me set some facts straight. The idea in the paragraph above from 
Jodi Hoffman is quite contrary to the ideas held by Scientologists. 
The idea in the paragraph above has to do with the ideas held by the 
secular humanists and their attempts to explain human behaviour as 
having nothing to do with a will, but as just chemical reactions. 
Make sure you know exactly what ideas are held by a particular group 
before you attempt to denounce them. As Mark Twain once said, "First 
get your facts straight; then you can distort them."

--Dylan

FWIW, I heartily agree that Jodi probably "despises porn so much she's 
seeing red", which she has every right to do. However! She's quoting 
studies that are crocks, so her entire agrument is fallacious, as 
TruthMonger so eloquently pointed out. :)
