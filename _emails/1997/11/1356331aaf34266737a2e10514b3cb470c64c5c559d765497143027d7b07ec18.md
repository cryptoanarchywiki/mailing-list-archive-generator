It was still Russia. The claims of incompetence and internal unrest apply to
both regimes. Is there some point you wish to review regarding this point?

Actualy, the Russians never beat the Japanese prior to Khalkal Gol.

This was the battle of Chankufeng Hill (1938). My sources indicate the
casualties were approx. 10,000 on each side.

But(!), the relevant point of this conflict is one simple point. The
Russians didn't re-inforce *or* launch their counter-attack until *after*
Sorge had assured the Russians that the Japanese would *not* re-inforce
themselves (which they didn't). Further, it is important to note that Zhukov
employed a massively superior force, including weapons, the likes of which
had never been employeed by the Russians before. In addition, Zhukov is
notable not for his strategic sense but his tenacity, he didn't care about
casualties and did not withdraw once forces were committed. Even though it
was clear that the Japanese would have withdrawn because of lack of
reinforcements. It was a show battle from the military perspective.

Only after he was shure that the Japanese wouldn't contest it.

> Technically speaking, Moscow did fall. :-)

Militarily speaking Moscow didn't fall. :-) There was no battle. The course
taken by the Tzars in dealing with Moscow was a political move that would
actualy provide them with more return than an actual battle. Remember,
Moscow was the fort (ala Kremli), the capital was St. Petersburg. This
strategy was discussed and discarded by Stalin as being politicaly
unworkable.

Actualy they did walk in. Napolean spent six weeks at the Kremli before
realizing the folly of his misunderstanding. He was waiting on the Tzarist
forces fro St. Petersburg. By that time 3/4 of Moscow had been burned to the
ground.

The Cossacks didn't arrive until shortly *after* the French began moving
their van out of Moscow.

But it's irrelevant to this discussion.

Irrelevant to this discussion as well.
