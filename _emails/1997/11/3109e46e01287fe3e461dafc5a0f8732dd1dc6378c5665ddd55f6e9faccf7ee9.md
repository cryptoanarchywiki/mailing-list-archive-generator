* Several news organizations reported in March and April on
Japanese men's increasing sexual fascination with high school and
junior-high school girls.  One expert interviewed by the New
York Times, Hiroyuki Fukuda, 30, editor of a magazine whose
title can be translated Anatomical Illustrations of Junior High
School Girls, said, "The age at which the girls seem interesting is
clearly dropping.  But it's only the maniacs who go for girls
below the third grade."
