    the assholes missed the point...

>U.S.  government takes hard line on Mitnick.  
>US Hacker Pleads for Help
>
>A US 'hacker'- Kevin David Mitnick - has issued a plea

>
>USA.  Through Randolph, Mitnick is claiming that the

>In one of the most amazing claims, Mitnick claims to

    anybody who thinks that does not happen in Federal
    prisons has their eyes closed.  the only light is
    through the observation port, and a 4 in. hole in
    the floor is provided for defecation, etc. the one
    hour per day is for exercise and the every other 
    day shower. cell space requirement: 49 sq. ft.

    the feds will not permit the states this torture,
    but that does not stop the BOP...

>Perhaps the most puzzling aspect to the whole case is
>the fact that while the US government has never sought
>to prove that Mitnick profited from his 'hacking'
>activities - although he could certainly have done so
>by 'selling' stolen airtime to third parties.  Instead
>they claim he caused losses in excess of $80 million.
>
    easier to charge losses for what he used and/or
    blocked

>Kevin certainly appears to be paying the price for his
>nefarious deeds having already spent nearly two years
>in custody during which time he has been prohibited
>from any access to wireless communications equipment,
>computer hardware or computer software.
>
    well, what do you expect? something of value?

>It's difficult to know exactly which side is the more

    must be a cypherpunk candidate; we know they're
    trying to take over.

    sure...
