Nothing can stop them completely from starting up your machine.  The best
thing you can do is to use a bios password, but that won't hold up if
somebody cracks open the machine.

If somebody can get physical control of your computer, they can start it
up.  However, that doesn't mean that they can run anything important.
Encrypt your files and install everything on one of the secure filesystems
floating around ( like SFS from
http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/sfs.html ).

Also check out the following site for a description of a secure notebook
machine:
