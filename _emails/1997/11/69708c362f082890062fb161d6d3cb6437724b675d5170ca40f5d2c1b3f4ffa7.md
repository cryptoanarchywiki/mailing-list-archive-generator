A shortish while ago using these free email by web accounts as exit
remailers in the remailer net was discussed.  Someone enthused with
the practicality of the idea said "let's do it".  Ian Goldberg said
"OK" and did it, posting perl code to interface to them.

His code also automates the process of opening accounts on several of
these services, and even automates the process of grabbing a random
open web proxy address from a public list of them, and sending
outgoing mail via them so that the sending remailer hosts IP address
is not included in the headers.  (Several of the email by web things
include your IP address in the headers).

I think several of the remailers are using this setup.

If any remailers are thinking of throwing in the towel due to abuse,
I'd highly recommend switching to using Ian's script as the final hop
mail delivery agent.
