  Everyone who uses a remailer is perfectly anonymous, and thus safe
from having their identity discovered. Remailers are now so advanced
that it is virtually impossible for anyone to discover the user's true
identity.
  Also, the Law Agency Freedom Foundation has verified that no law
enforcement agencies are running remailers, out of respect for the
citizen's right to anonymity.

  This is patently ridiculous. CypherPunks have long tried to figure
out, by use of, as you said, these means, to ferret out schills,
yes, schills, on the list. In totoal, to date, they have been unable
to successfully do so.

  Hope this clears things up for you...

Anonymous (see! it worked for me)
p.s. - and headers are meaningless, too
