I've been writing a gigantic e$ rant, :-), which I haven't done in a while,
and so I've left things to pile up in my POP account until I was done. I'm
done, and I'm still bashing the (blatant :-)) silliness out of it, and will
send it here soon.

In the meantime, I wanted to find a quick and dirty list of informal
logical fallacies, and, while I was at it, I bumped into Mission:Critical,
which is fairly comprenensive website on logic an critical thinking.
Evidently you can earn college credit on it, for those of you who need
college credit. :-). Here it is.

http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/itl/

Also, I've found a reasonable list of informal fallacies, from
<http://ddi.digital.net/~setzerl/LOGIC.htm>, (which see for applicable
attributions) which I've appended here. That way, you can all keep score at
home. Expect me to use a bunch, whether I want to or not... :-). Notice
that argumentum ad hominem is when you discount someone's opinion because
of who they are or what they do. Vuperative insults, it seems, are another
thing altogether.  :-).


It's a shame that Tim seems to have killfiled me at this point. Usually, I
like it, because then I can post stuff here without him tearing me a new
asshole very time.  This time, since I'm doing the tearing, maybe he's just
hiding. Which is fine, because he can run, but he can't hide on this crap
anymore...

More in a bit, when I get e$pam all caught up.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga

  conclusion with a bid for respect  founder of our nation, warned us
  for traditions.                    against taking such a course of
                                     action."

  The Bandwagon Fallacy: Appeals to
  an interest in following the       "You ought to buy a small European
  crowd and doing as they do rather  sports car as all members of the smart

                   Slick Maneuver Identification Table #3

                Fallacies of Involved or Complex Assumptions

              SLICK MANEUVER                           EXAMPLE

  Begging the Question (Petitio
  Principii): Assumes what needs to be    "All the events in nature are
  proven and offers this assumption as    determined. Human events are
  evidence for a conclusion that only     part of the events in nature.
  particularizes the assumption or that   Therefore, human events are
  restates an equivalent form of the      determined."
  original assumption.

  Arguing in a Circle: Uses a premise as  "Democracy is desirable because
  evidence to establish a conclusion,     it promotes freedom of inquiry.
  and this conclusion is used as          But why is freedom of inquiry
  evidence to establish the original      desirable? Because it promotes
  premise.                                democracy."

  Name-Tagging: Assumes the attachment
  of labels to persons or things          "This application is easy to
  constitute evidence for conclusions     use. Look at its label, 'Easy
  about the objects to which the labels   Applicator.'"
  are applied.

                                          "Anything that you say would be

                                          distorted and unreliable."

  Complex Question: Assumes or
  presupposes a certain state of
  affairs, so that any answer involves    "Have you stopped telling lies?"
  the granting of the assumption.

  Leading Question: "Plants" a proposed   "You do believe that longer
  answer to a question by the manner in   vacations are desirable, do you
  which the question is asked.            not?"

  Contradictory Assumptions: Attempts to
  make two or more contradictory          "What would happen if an
  assumptions, thus violating the         irresistible force met an
  Aristotelian rule of "either-or."       immovable object?"

                   Slick Maneuver Identification Table #4

               Fallacies of Imprecision in the Use of Language

          SLICK MANEUVER                           EXAMPLE

  The Misuse of Vague             "You claim that you believe in free
  Expressions: Occurs if a        enterprise, yet you accept socialistic
  conclusion not justified by     practices of government like the War on
  evidence is attributable to     Poverty and Medicare. The American way
  the misinterpretation of a      of life has never endorsed a policy of
  vague expression.               providing something for nothing."

  The Fallacy of Simple
  Ambiguity: Results from an
  effort to establish a           "We cannot expect John to come since he
  conclusion by interpreting a    said, 'Nothing will deter me from
  statement in a manner not       coming.'"
  justified by the context.

  The Fallacy of Equivocation:    "Everything subject to law is subject to
  Changes or shifts the meaning   a lawgiver. The natural order is subject
  of a key expression in the      to a law. Therefore, the natural order
  middle of an argument.          is subject to a lawgiver."

  The Fallacy of Amphibole:
  Occurs if a conclusion not      "No cat has nine tails. Any cat has one
  justified by evidence is based  more tail than no cat. Therefore, any
  upon ambiguity attributed to    cat has ten tails."
  the syntax of a sentence.

  The Fallacy of Ambiguity of
  Significance: Occurs in the     "A period of higher unemployment is
  drawing of an improper          developing, since there was a one

  when improper emphasis is       are good and other parts interesting.
  placed upon a word, phrase, or  The interesting parts are inaccurate and
  a sentence and on this basis a  the good parts were copied." The student
  conclusion is inferred.         wrote his parents, "The grader wrote
                                  that my theme was 'good' and
                                  'interesting.'"

  Infers that the property of an  perfecting appendectomies, Dr. James
  organized whole also            Doe, the new surgeon in our town, has
  characterizes the parts of the  spent many years in perfecting his
  whole.                          technique in performing appendectomies."

  The Fallacy of Composition:     "Since the members of this team are the
  Infers that the qualities or    best players of their respective
  characteristics of parts of a   positions in the conference, a team
  whole must also characterize    composed of these players would be the
  the whole itself.               best team in the conference."

                          Fallacies of Irrelevance

           SLICK MANEUVER                           EXAMPLE

  Fallacies Misusing Appeals to
  Authoritative Sources: Support a
  conclusion by appeals to           "Man must be immortal because this

  beliefs, or the opinions of        such widely differing societies in
  well-known persons that are not    highly divergent circumstances over
  particularly germane or qualified  such a long span of history."

  rational evidence in the support   might find that your machinery has

                                     troubles increase."

  The Appeal to the Man (Argumentum
  Ad Hominem): Seeks to prove a      "The statement of this witness cannot
  conclusion false by attacking the  be accepted as reliable, since he
  character, reputation,             participated in a protest
  associations, or social            demonstration against the United
  situations of the person           States' foreign policy when he was a
  proposing it.                      student in college."

  The Argument from Intimidation:
  Asserts arbitrarily that a
  person's idea is false and then
  uses the assertion as proof of     "John asserts that no man is his
  that person's immorality. This     brother's keeper. This is a false
  fallacy was identified by Ayn      idea. Therefore, John is immoral."
  Rand in The Virtue of
  Selfishness.

  The Appeal to Ignorance
  (Argumentum Ad Ignorantium):
  Advances the position that if one  "Since you cannot disprove that there
  conclusion in an argument cannot   are flying saucers, you should accept

                                     a graduate of a university."

  The Argumentative Leap (Non
  Sequitur): Jumps to a conclusion   "The electoral college is subject to
  with no immediate basis for        extreme criticism. Therefore,
  drawing the proposed conclusion    presidential candidates should be
  provided internally within the     nominated by popular votes rather
  argument.                          than by political conventions."

  Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc (After
  This, Therefore Because of This):
  Suggests that because one event    "John had a cold. John took large
