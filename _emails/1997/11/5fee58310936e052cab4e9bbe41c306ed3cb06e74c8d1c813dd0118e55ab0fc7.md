Good god, Jonathan, you trying to get the JY-box TWA 800ed on 
CIA-TV Barney? Send fee for using TM nym.

Spoofing persistent identities, writing style, secret thoughts and hidden
agendas are adult-nut-rated kid's stuff here, the weirdo pitches the 
easiest of all, especially the puretext missionary position in white socks 
style of blackhearts which ever vaunts itself best See Jane Read Spot.

Who do you think "John Young" is if not a machinic composite 
of all previous, current and conceivable and abortable of cpunks, and 
pseudo-cpunks, extra bile-sauced with apish objective journalism 
gone stale, foul, rancid and roadkill tastier, by all the crazed truly 
knowns and unknowns passing through claoked in incredibly ordinary, 
goofily Anglicized, hide-shame names of the world's English-imitating 
kill-native cultures. 

To wit: "John Young," no other vapid pseudonym have ever been so 
often used to hide god's evilist holies.

Except the other subscribers.
