Uh, Hello?  Your post entitled "1st Great Awakening" describes the exact
same thing that I called simply, "The Great Awakening."  It was not, as you
say above, the 2nd one.

I did read the various posts you sent.  I don't know who chose the names for
the 2nd and 3rd "Great Awakenings", but they don't seem to have much to do
with religious revivalism like your "1st Great Awakening" and what I (and
the definitive Norton Anthology) refer to as simply "The Great Awakening."
