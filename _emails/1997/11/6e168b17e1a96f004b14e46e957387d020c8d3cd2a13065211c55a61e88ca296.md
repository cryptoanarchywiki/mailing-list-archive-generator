  Are you preparing this testimony for the trial, or for the press?
I'd be more than happy to kick in some leftover plutonium for you to
plant in Tim's home, if you plan on setting him up after I've finished
my...uuhhh...home project.

  Most of the "poison" seems to be coming from Tim's detractors, chief
of whom is yourself, at present. Why don't you try limiting yourself
to 10,000 words of ranting and finger-pointing for every "Nuke DC"
statment Tim makes?

  Please give the rest of us credit for being self-willed individuals
who are perfectly capable of promoting our own brand of sickening
violence, rather than just going along with the suggestions that
Tim makes in our late-night secret meetings where we discuss the
our plans for the overthrow of anarchy in the world.

  As Robert Hettinga stated in a previous post, I think that your
constant rants about innocent childen betray some kind of sick 
fixation on them. Please try to keep your hands away from your
private body parts when thinking about them. That might help.

  Boy, now I'm having problems keeping my hands away from _my_ private
parts. Back in a minute...

...

  You seem to be the one both pumping most of the sewage and doing
most of the wallowing in it. Of course, you're just groping around
in it looking for 'bad' people, aren't you? It's not like you get
cheap, vicarious thrills dwelling on these kinds of topics.
  When you testify in court, or give your interviews to the press,
remember to keep your hands tucked in your armpits. Folding them
together on your lap might prove to be too much of a temptation.

  BTW, thanks for those pictures of Princess Di's death scene that
you sent me. Great closeups!
