* San Francisco "conceptual artist" Guy Overfelt, 29, was
prominently, if not favorably, reviewed for two recent projects:  For
a show at the Refusalon gallery in San Francisco, he called 2,000
toll-free numbers to request that information be sent to the gallery. 
(That's it.)  For a show at New York City's White Columns Gallery
in the winter, he exhibited two 1,000-name mailing lists of art
collectors, one for the East Coast and one for the West Coast. 
(Overfelt offered for sale a "signed" edition of the mailing lists, on
PC and Mac diskettes, for $20 each.)
