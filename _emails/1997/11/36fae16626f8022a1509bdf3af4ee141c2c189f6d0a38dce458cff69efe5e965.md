Bob Hettinga said it was in the 1800's.  You said you thought it started in 
the 1500's, going no later than the early 1700's.  Bob retorted that he 
thought you were confusing the Renaissance with the Great Awakening.  I
chimed in by quoting Norton's Anthology which stated that the period was
in the early 18th century.  Take 10 minutes to "check the archives."

If you look back at my post, you will see that this is what I (and Norton) 
were claiming.  The early eighteenth century = the early 1700's!  Read my
first post which included the quote from Norton's Anthology.

In other words, we both agree that the Great Awakening ended by the middle
of the eighteenth century (a.k.a., 1700's), not the middle of the nineteenth
century (a.k.a., 1800's) as Bob was claiming.

"Second Turning" has to due with the cyclical theory that the authors of the 
web page you cited have written about.  The fact is that they refer to that 
time period (early 1700's/18th c.) as the Great Awakening, not the Second 
Great Awakening.  If you read the other pages at the site *more carefully* 
you will see that they were stuffing the Great Awakening into their theory 
under the category named the Second Turning (out of four, thus the site's 
name: fourthturning.com).

Notice your Subject: line says 1st Great Awakening, but that you're using the
parenthetically referenced Second Turning as a justification to contradict
what I (and you) have been saying all along.  What's going on here?

How can we have any meaningful discussion on this list when we don't pay any
attention to what we are writing or what others wrote?
