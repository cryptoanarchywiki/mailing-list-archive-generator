Seems to me that people imitate the accents of others all the time. I just
saw Eddie Griffin on HBO, "Voodoo Child," doing some dead-on imitations of
honkeys, Brits, and other blacks. So?

Their likely clients don't given one whit what comments they may have made
on mailing lists. Hell, their clients don't even care if they're
card-carrying members of the KKK.

Utter nonsense. Business clients don't care. Nor do the Japs care, as they
have made vastly more racist remarks every day of every year for the past
half century or more.

Sensitive flowers such as yourself need to move out of places like
Amsterdam and get with the program.
