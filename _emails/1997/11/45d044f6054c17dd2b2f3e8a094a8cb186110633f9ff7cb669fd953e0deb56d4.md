Paul Pomes is one of the least intelligent members of the Databasix gang.
He's been harrassing Jeff B.'s upstreams and employers with false complaints
at the same time Gary Burnore, Belinda Bryant, and the rest of the Databasix
gang did, eventually killing the huge cajones remailer. Now they're after
on bureau42. For some reason Pomes slipped and cc'd me one his false complaints
(even though he was ordered not to send me any more e-mail). I ask everyone to
 a) complain about Paul Pomes to Qualcomm, his employer
 b) discuss what we can do to protect bureau42 from Databasix harrassment
