        Actually there are the courts who write their own law by intuition
protected by life tenure.

        There has been a suggestion to outlaw political parties. Once
outlawed solicitations and organizations could be criminalized. 

        More practically, the ultimate objective if to find a way to
prohibit politicians from being involved in any that can yield a profit.
Force they to stick to the "thou shalt nots." Never let them get into areas
where compliance with the law can yield a profit. "For only from profits
can come campaign contributions."

        But certainly any professed citizen acting in a manner other than
the pure self interest of the US be sent elsewhere. 

        Or as RAH suggested, voting should not be matter of age and
breathing only.

        Anyone involved in the illegal drug business and in his right mind
does everything he can to assure that his drugs remain illegal. That
includes encouraging every manner of condemnation of drugs even if only
inviting the simpletons to give their anti-drug speech for a hefty
honorarium.

        I have often suspected this is the alternate reality created by a
satirist. Nothing can really be as absurd of this.
