All perfectly legal, and probably would have been fun, had I the disposable
income or time (both of which seem to be mutual exclusive, in my life :-))
to do it...

Especially when the judge hasn't, and especially after making vieled
intimations about Dark Times To Come, the War Being Almost Upon Us, "Lock
and Load", and all that other cruft.

BTW, I have found that most people who go around saying "Lock and Load" all
the time are posers who've never actually had to in anger, or, if they
have, they're too old to remember how, anyway... :-/.

"Semper Fi", on the other hand... :-)

Nope. This Little Bunny Rabbit has teeth. Grrrrrr... :-).

Nope. CryptoAnarchy Rulez, d00d... Doesn't mean I'm going to go bang the
gorilla cage at the local precinct to go make it happen by, um,
Thanksgiving.

I seem to have answered this previously. Twice, now.

Now, *that*'s an Ad Hominem. *Congratulations*, Tim. (Did you read my list
of informal fallacies? I found one, you know. I even posted it to the list,
somewhere. Check the archives...)

Yup, it seems you'd rather do it in the comfort of your own home...

You keep throwing these low slow ones, Tim, I'll keep "blasting" them.

Maybe you should have your arm looked at. Is it bursitis? *How* would you
get *that*? ...oop... Never mind...

Cheers,
Bob
