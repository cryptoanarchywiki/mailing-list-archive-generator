        It would appear to me that an illegal in the country is as much in
the act of committing a crime as a burglar is while in a place other than
his own.

        The politicians are responding to voters. The voters who are
pressuring them are siding with foreign nationals against the interests of
the United States which is presumed to be their new country of loyalty.
That siding should be sufficient justification remove citizenship and
return them to the land of dysentary and mui Ninos.

        The people who made handgun ownership a felony gave them that right. 

        Lawmakers are resonsible for all foreseeable consequences not just
the intended consequences.
