Have you heard of a Mac compatible OS called "COS" from Omega in East Germany? 
I just found an article about it in Japanese Mac mag and that says Omega
announced the OS 11/13 at German MacWorldExpo. 

And actually "COS" stands for " Crypt OS", their blurb on the website says:  

              Are you looking for full Mac OS 8 compatibility that
              includes all of its features, but that also has the added
              advantage of genuine B2-Security plus an integrated
              PGP-compatible Mail Client? 

              Do you want to be able to finally work really fast and to use
              preemptive multi-tasking? 

etc....

There's an interview with Omega's president in the article saying the OS
runs on 030, 040 & PowerPC without MacROM inside. So bunch of Mac clones
and CHRP mother boards from Taiwan etc may find a way....
