Yes. To do it using standard proggies, hash each of your paragraphs and put the
results in a PGP-signed message. Quoter provides signature and signed hashes. 
Reader hashes your quoted paragraph and checks the signed message to see if it
was one of the original paragraphs. So simple I can do it. :) 

[Disclaimer: I think.]

A more cool-sounding solution would be to concatenate those hashes and sign
them (not a hash of them) as one packet. Since RSA sigs are secret-key
decryptions (right?), the reader can re-encrypt it and check any individual
hash. Not more secure, though, and it takes a lot of processor time.

No idea how to do it with bit-level granularity.

Mental poker? Easy.

Allows you a tad too much freedom with their quotes, too...
