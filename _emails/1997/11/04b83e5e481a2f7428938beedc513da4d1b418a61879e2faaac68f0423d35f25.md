Well, PGP has come to it's senses and is allowing non-commercial developers
to use the sdk for free.  I didn't notice anything too ominous in the
license agreement, and they promise a new licensing/prices for shareware
and small commercial developers.

Perhaps nobody is buying the sdk at it's current highly inflated licensing
price.
