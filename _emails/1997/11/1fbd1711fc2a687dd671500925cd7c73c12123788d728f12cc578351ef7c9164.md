Which Eudora version are you using?
Eudora Light (and Pro, of course) have always let you see the headers,
if you'll work your way through the Tools->Options menus.
Under 3.x, the message reading window has a "Blah Blah Blah"
button to let you turn display of headers on and off easily.
I've configured my filters so that mail with obvious Toto headers in it
gets the Subject: line flagged so I notice it faster.
				Thanks!
