I found the part about aids more obscene.  Most new cases are among
promiscuous heterosexuals.  Of course if you are truly abstinent or
monogamous you don't have to worry, as all blood (in the US at least) is
now heavily tested and has been ever since HIV was found.  Looks like Mrs.
Hoffman should take a sex ed class so that she will be able to tell her
children the truth instead of made up fantasies.  Unreasonable fear is very
harmful to anyone's mental health, especially children.
