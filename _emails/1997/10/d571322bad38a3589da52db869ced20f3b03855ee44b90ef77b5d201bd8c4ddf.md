I understand this rationale.  But that doesn't explain what's 
happening to the missing messages.  Is there a flaw in the 
distributor/reflector duplicate-filtering algorithms?  Or is this
a problem of certain messages being introduced into a node whose
product does not get propagated to all subscribers of all the other
nodes?  Or are you saying that if ssz (say) goes down for a few
minutes it forgets about any mail it has queued up for its
counterparts at cyberpass and algebra (et al.)?
