There was a good op-ed in the WSJ on Monday. The Politics of Envy,
basically. Why everyone in Silicon Valley hates Microsoft...

But some of the complaints about Microsoft come down to personal taste. The
masses offend refined sensibilities when they buy Windows 95 in droves.
Rein them in! Stop them from buying what they want! Don't let them get free
copies of Internet Explorer.

I share Lizard's distaste for Microsoft products. My Unix workstation at
home has not one MSFT application on it. I have only Microsoft Word on my
Duo at work, and I could get by with WordPerfect. But our dislike for their
products doesn't mean that we are morally justified in restricting what the
company can do.
