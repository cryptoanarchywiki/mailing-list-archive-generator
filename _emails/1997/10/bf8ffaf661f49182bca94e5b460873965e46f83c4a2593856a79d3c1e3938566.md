Eh, no. The conclusion would be that gun control or no gun control
does not affect the amount of war in the world at all.

True, but imho this will only result in more people getting killed.
Any invader would not beat about the bush in the US, they'll make very
clear that they'll have nothing to do with citicens defending their
own homes. They'll just blow up the home from a distance.

Bullshit. People in the US rarely use their weapons against oppressive
governments or political turbulence. Most guns that are used against
another person there are used to commit crime or to defend against
those armed criminals.

Excuse me? Have you ever even been in Europe? In the last 50 years I
mean? You are so full of shit here, it's incredible. I hereby invite
you to come over, and stay a while. I have a comfy couch.

Anyone in Europe can go anywhere else, and be treated reasonably to
very well. We in Europe have put the crap of WWII behind us a long
time ago. Something that you haven't managed to do apparently.

The Dutch are absolutely not 'nursing a grudge'. Come and visit.
You'll see.

You have a nerve. You, coming from a country where people are still
regularly killed in the name of racism, tell me this?!

We absolutely not pretending that this can never be expressed. In
fact, it's being expressed every day. We have our neo-nazi political
parties too. It's just that we here have learned our lesson, and very
few people actually listen to them.

Sure you would. It just would be that more bloody. The fact that
someone is armed has never stopped anyone from attacking. You just
make sure that your shot is the first and hits.

They are just more likely to become dead.

- From over here it appears that the majority of Americans doesn't
really give a shit. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Yes, things are a bit of a shambles at the other side of the pond.
Maybe for you it's a good thing to be armed to the teeth. For us over
here, arming the population would only serve to fill the morgues.
