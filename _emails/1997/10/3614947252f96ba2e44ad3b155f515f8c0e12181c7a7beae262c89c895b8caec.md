Dear MicroServe Subscriber,

The MIS accounting department is in the process of upgrading it's 
software.  Unfortunately, they found some information missing from your
account.  So, we're going to need your help.

Please go to the following URL (web address) with your WWW browser
(Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc) and follow the online instructions.
You should not have to anything except click CONTINUE once you arrive at
the page.

PLEASE NOTE: This must be done from YOUR ppp (dial-up) account.  The
system will not work if you try to do this from a friend's (or any
other) dial-up account.

UNIX Shell customers should call (717)821-5964 extension 3 to speak with
a technical support representative.

Any account which still has info missing as of November 1, 1997 will be
suspended (and will be deleted on November 8, 1997), as we will have to 
assume that the email box belongs to no one.

If you have any questions, please email helpdesk@microserve.net.

Thank You,
MicroServe Engineering Department
