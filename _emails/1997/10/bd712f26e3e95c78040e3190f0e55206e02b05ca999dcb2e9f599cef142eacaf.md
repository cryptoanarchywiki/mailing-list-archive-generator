It's also the longest sentence they can give with no possibility for
parole.  You neglected to mention that, and I think it's highly relevent. 
I'm not familiar with the particular case you describe, but I used to know
a man who ended up going to jail for two years less a day for raping his
daughter, and in the decision, the judge said he really wanted to give him
a much longer sentence, but considered it more important to be certain
he'd be kept away from the family as long as possible.
