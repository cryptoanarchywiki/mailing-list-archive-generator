The TruthMailer service at dev.null has become very unpopular. So
unpopular, in fact, that we are now approaching limitations in what 
our abuse department can handle. The great outrage this weekend and
subsequent delays in spamming various mailing lists are the result 
of this. For our immediate needs, we could sure use some more DRUGS,
ALCOHOL, and BROADS.
If a million people could donate $1,000 apiece, this would be great.
If one million people donate $100,000 apiece, we can buy Micro$oft. 
Anonymous snail mail with anonymous cash (US dollars or money order)
would be appreciated. If you want to be acknowledged as a donor on
our arrest sheets, we can do that too. The address to send to is: 

Electronic Forgery Foundation
Box 281,
Bienfait, Saskatchewan
      CANADA  S0C 0M0

A thousand bucks or whatever you can afford. We'll take drug, alcohol
and loose women donations, too.
Contact Louis J. Freeh <toto@sk.sympatico.ca> if you have something
to donate. It might be a sting operation, but I'm not sure; Louis
will know.

PCP DustMan / Home Drug Lab for Molecular Structure and Design
For an anti-reality drug recipe, send me mail with subject "Hi(gh)".
Append "+realitysucks" to my abusername to ensure entrapment.
Decryption is too important to leave to the recipient--Louis J. Freeh
