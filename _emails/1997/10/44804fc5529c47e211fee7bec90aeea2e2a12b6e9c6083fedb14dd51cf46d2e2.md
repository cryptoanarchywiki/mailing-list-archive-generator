How Fast Is your System?

Project RC5 is an attempt to beat the RSA Secret-Key Challenge by
using desktop computers to plug away at possible solutions in their
spare processor time. One nifty side effect of all these boxes
attempting the same process is an accurate comparison of true
processor speeds. The compiled statistics show clearly what is often
overlooked: not all megahertzes are created equal. A 180-MHz Pentium
Pro ranges from 413 kk/s (thousand keys per second) running Windows 95
to 461 kk/s under Linux. In comparison, 180-MHz Macs range from 434
kk/s (a Motorola machine with a 603e chip running MacOS 7.6.1) to 530
kk/s (a Motorola 604e with MacOS 8). That's a significant difference.
The fastest single-processor computer is a Power Mac 9600/350, with a
350-Mhz PowerPC 604e chip, that slices through 1012 kk/s. Check these
stats out and compare not only platforms, but operating systems, too.
