If you're going to respond to Tim's post, you should copy him or
cypherpunks... I've attached your whole message below...

I will respond to one point, though:

>The free market approach won't keep medical records private.

We haven't tried that approach yet, at least in the late 20th century. The
wealth of federal regulation and involvement in health care is
breathtaking. Ever since after WWII when for tax reasons businesses began
bundling insurance and the rise of medicare/medicaid, well, the "free
market" in healthcare has become much less robust. (Fortunately Clinton's
socialistic health care plan was derailed.)

In other words, the reason a "free market" approach may not work right now
is because the market isn't free.
