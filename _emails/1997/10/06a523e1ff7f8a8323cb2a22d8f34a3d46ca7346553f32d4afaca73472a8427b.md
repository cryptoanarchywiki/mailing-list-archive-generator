I try to avoid "me too" posts, but I agree 100% with this. Somehow we have
to convince a bunch of legislators that technological solutions are
superior or legal ones in protecting info-privacy. Perhaps an analogy with
welfare might help (at least with conservative members): access to crypto
vs. laws protecting privacy is like private job creation vs. welfare. Do we
want to live in a state where we are mandated to rely on the government for
privacy (even if we could trust the government)?

Thanks also for the concrete example of how pedophiles could make use of a
parent's lack of encryption/signing.
