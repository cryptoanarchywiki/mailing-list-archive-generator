If anyone has a copy of Viacrypt's Pretty Good Prying, it would be nice
if they would make it available to those who want to get to work finding
out how to best sabotage it.
I am not against Viacrypt producing surveillance software for those who
want it, but I resent their perversion of a product whose reputation
capital is the result of the integrity and effort of a great many people
whose interests lie in privacy, not in surruptitious surveillance.

I can guarantee that any system I have access to which contains this
twisted sister of PGP will have my hand up its dress, playing with its
private parts.

What is ViaCrypt's marketing plan?
"Make sabotaging the security of your system a badge of honour among
 the elite of the computer security industry. Buy mis-represented PGP."

"You need not fear our product having been sabotaged by privacy purists
 within ViaCrypt, because we fired all the people with integrity."

"We stole the reputation, but we wouldn't steal your information."

"It's not GAK. I was just clearing my throat."

"Tired of the employees banging your wife...?"
