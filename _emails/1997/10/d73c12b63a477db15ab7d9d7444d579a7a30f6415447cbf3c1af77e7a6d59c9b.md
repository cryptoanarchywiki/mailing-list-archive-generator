  Has anyone on the list taken the time to estimate the percentage
of TV shows (news/entertainment/etc.) which seem to mostly serve to
help indoctrinate the masses with New World Order Speak?
  e.g. - Surveillance == Security / Police == Protection

VideoCatchingCriminals III (or somesuch), is due out soon. C-16, Jag,
Michael Hayes, Cops, ad infinituum, and not a one of them showing
a citizen with a toilet plunger sticking out of his or her asshole.
Even Jenny Jones, et al, are doing shows where parents video-spy on
the babysitter, husbands video-spy on their wives, etc.

If "Total Surveillance is your Friend!" then why were there no video
cameras in the restroom of the NYC police precinct?

  Cypherpunk Action Project or just my insanity?: Are there any list
members who were kicked out of the US Armed Forces after only one
day and are now full-fledged members of the paramilitary?
  Why don't you go bomb a federal building with a day-care center
in it, and see if the government and media blame it all on the 
US Armed forces?

  You know, kind of a "life imitates fascism" situation.
