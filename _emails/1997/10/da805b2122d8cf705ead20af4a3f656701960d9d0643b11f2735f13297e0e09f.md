I say we bomb the shit out of the newsgroup if it gets formed.
We need a new newsgroup flooding and blasting.

Those basdtards like CAUCE who try to censor make it very
legal to take the gloves off and just wipe them out with
mailbombing and SYN and ping attacks!!!

KILL CAUCE!!!  They are all mostly Pedophiles!
