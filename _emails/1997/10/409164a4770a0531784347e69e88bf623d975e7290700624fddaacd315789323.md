typo, I meant to write "I _can't_ say I like the practice".

And yes, Jim Choate, re moderation re-runs some of us do have too much
time on our hands :-)

We make this time by not sleeping much, jeeze it's 1:30am and I'm just
starting to get going on the GAK compliancy argument in another thread
again, and I've got an article submission deadline for tomorrow also,
which I haven't even started yet!
