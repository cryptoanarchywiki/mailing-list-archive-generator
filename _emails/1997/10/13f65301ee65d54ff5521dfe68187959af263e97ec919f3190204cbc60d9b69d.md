I am not sure you can really say they are the NSA equivalent. I would
rather say they are the equivalent of, say, the office in the dpt of
commerce which gives the export authorizations in the US. What I mean is
that I doubt they are listening to anybody. Other french agencies do
that (and each agency, wether its depends on the police, like DST, RG,
or the army, DGSE, DSM, has its own group of people listening to anybody
they like). A normal police department could do it too, but then they
will need a warrant of some kind. None of the agencies above probably
bothers with things like that, as they will usually say "secret dÃ©fense"
if they are asked questions (some french equivalent of "national
security").

I would say people who wrote the current law 2 years ago didn't have a
clue on the technical issues, anyway. That's why we are still waiting
for the "decrets d'application", which are the set of rules on how the
law will be enforced. Somehow I would bet they are waiting to see where
the wind blow at the international level.

It's in french, so I won't quote. The article has a very neutral
position, but they point out exactly the same thing as you.

I know at least one academic site where system administrator were
prevented from switching to ssh because of the legal issue. Seems the
campus administration folks wanted to protect their asses...

I don't have the technical expertise to discuss your proposal, so I
won't (seems less snoop friendly to me than the PGP5.5 solution,
still). But what I certainly fail to understand is why PGP inc (and
people who support them) is focusing on a solution which allows to
intercept and read e-mail in transit. That inherently evil, no matter
you put it. And the "hit by a truck" hypothesis doesn't stand a minute
in real life (Yah, shit happens, so what ?). The (legitimate) needs of a
company can be achieved via an agreement with its employees, on how data
are stored, backed, duplicated, whatever, and it has merely nothing to
do with cryptography. Or am I missing something obvious ?
And as far as the "legitimate needs of the law enforcement agencies",
well, if they want to read e-mail sent by an employee from his company
account because he is a potential drug dealer, they can obtain the
proper authorization from the court and snoop on the guy from within the
company. As usual, the weakest link is the guy typing on his keyboard,
as I doubt anybody speaks IDEA fluently...(even rot13 I am
skeptical. Crime organizations in Paris at the beginning of the century
were using "Javanais", which was a very basic code, but sufficient to
confuse the police)
So why isn't everybody focusing on being sure the transport layer is
secure, and leave to social interaction at both end of the communication
process the problem of recovery of whatever was transmitted ? (which, I
feel dumb for saying it, was in clear at some point before being sent,
and will be when it will be read...)

Sounds fair to me.

And he needs proper authorization before coming. And yes, it takes time
but that's the price to pay in a system with separation of powers.

Yes, yes, yes. And still I am sure that we will hear objections to
that... sigh....
