You sir are an unmittigated ass and more than a tad immature and selfish.

I will not forcefully unsubscribe anyone from the SSZ node unless cops start
showing up at my door giving me shit, in which case the node might go down
(hopefully temporarily). I may not like what he did but I'll be damned if
I'll go back on my beliefs in free speech just because you or I don't like
it. You want freedom, learn to give it even when it hurts.

Grow up and learn to deal with it.
