Duhhh!  Typical Unicornish answer: completely out of context.


The agreement with the phone company is to provide you with a 
service, while the agreement with the employer is for you to devote 
your time to his cause.  Buy doing personnal activities outside of 
certain accepted ones, you defraud him.  Did you indulge into calling 
your girlfriend in Tokyo while in your office? Did you get a pat in 
the back from your boss?

Duhhh ^2
But does that precludes the requirement by the company that all 
e-mail pertaining to  company activities be decryptable by them?

Duhhh ^3  I did not said it, you did.  If you want to have a vague 
idea of my idea of property, just refer to Ayn Rand philosophy for a 
close enough explanation.

You are almost absolved.  :-)  This anti-knowledge way of interacting 
is unfortunately widely thaught.  But from the moment you realize it, 
it becomes a sin again...  :-)

I have no idea because I did not look at it.  Only, from a business 
standpoint, it doesn't only makes sense to be able to decrypt 
employees data, it is a sine qua none condition for the 
implementation of encryption at corporate level.  IMNSHO.

Double talk.  I never said it *owns* the employees, I said it owns 
the *means* of communication and, as per mutual agreement between 
employee and employer, the employee's time.  The employee AND the 
employer are, most of the time, free to walk out anytime.

Accepting a paycheck has nothing to do with selling your soul, it is 
a contractual agreement.  You have to fullfill it.  It is based on 
good faith.

There is a large part of happenstance in this.  Doing business with 
the Nazis is an extreme and many condemned it.  Doing business within 
the USA is another thing.

Oh, but I do not question that you act.  Only, your pretended basic 
premises and the end result and general philosophy conveyed by most 
of your comments simply do not match you pretended agenda.

At least, we have something in common!  :-)
