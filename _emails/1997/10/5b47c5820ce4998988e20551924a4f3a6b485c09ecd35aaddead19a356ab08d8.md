OK, that means the correct technical term for my discussion is an
argument over the GAK compliancy subpacket type.

I really like this non-exportable signature option.  It is highly
useful.  I have a couple of keys on my key ring with signatures on
them that I have mentally flagged as non-exportable.  This is because
they are signatures by the True Name of nyms I happen to know the True
Name of and are intended to allow me to transfer the trust to that
Nym, but the Nym is trusting me not to make public this signature.

It would be really kind of neat to extend this functionality so that I
_couldn't_ export the key by making the certifcate a non-transferable
signature, or a designated verifier signature.

This is the controversial object.  I have been arguing in a couple of
earlier posts today that this design is a bad idea from a security
perspective, and from the point of view that it is a form of GAK
compliancy when coupled with PGP's SMTP policy enforcer.

The reason I say this is that if we get to the situation where many
businesses are using PGP 5.5 + PGP policy enforcer, the clients
"choice" to not encrypt to the message snooping second crypto
recipient in the CMRK subpacket will have little practical meaning.
The user will be forced to comply or be unable to send messages which
don't bounce.

A better place to do corporate snooping, and to avoid the extra
security risk of sending messages over the internet encrypted to two
rather than one long term encryption keys, is to snoop the plaintext
after it has been decrypted in the PGP 5.5 mail client.

Also, the message snooping functionality is reading between the lines;
Jon's post no where mentioned this as a user requirement.  What he
said was that corporates had a need to recover encrypted email
messages stored in encrypted mail folders.  If this is truly the case,
the functionality is even easier to achieve, just encrypt the mail
folder to a company escrowed storage key after decryption.  Easy to
do, and more secure.  Same flexibility in reflecting the internal
structure of the company's trust and risk management in the storage
key escrow architecture.

If PGP is going to forge ahead and try for this flawed message
snooping architecture anyway, I would urge you personally to at least
press upon them to remove the flag meaning that a message will not be
received without the use of the message snooping key, and to remove
the functionality preventing delivery in the SMTP policy enforcer.

OK.  The controversy has technical basis too -- and seems to be
starting to be discussed in this forum also.  There is also a question
of how this design interacts with the IETF policy of not allowing
political issues to weaken protocol designs to discuss.

I've read Matt's PolicyMaker paper.  I can see the attraction of
moving towards these generalisedl trust statement syntaxes.

I would be nice to see the topic of the recipient refusing email based
on policies relating to third party access to messages in transit
being addressed in the standard when and if PGP gets to that stage.

There are some nice uses for some types of recipient refusal.  Ecash
payment for message processing, or my less $ oriented hashcash
proposal also.  (The types of problem that can arise with real ecash
payment for receipt, which hashcash avoids is that if applied to
discussion forums, it can bias the forums to allowing through more of
what rich people have to say.  A similar argument perhaps applies to
email following up to comments made in public forums, you can only
reply to someone if you have the money.  Busy people may set very high
payment rates.)

I can see problems with this type of assertion.  I hope when the time
comes that a way to define a convetion or set of rules which disallows
this as part of the standard.

We'll see when we get to it.  In the mean time, PolicyMaker &
look-alikes are vapourware.

It's similar to PICs in that third party rating services are fine (for
example consumer product evaluations in various magazines), but
centrally controlled ones are objectionable to many of us.

The problem with this point, which you say is PRZ's, is that it falls
down for interoperability reasons when the system is widely deployed.
Exactly how much "choice" do you have when 80% of businesses will
bounce your mail if you don't comply.  How much "choice" do you have a
few years later when 95% of individuals and companies are using the
same system, and the government is holding the master snooping keys.

[1] The long term likely value of this choice is rather low, so the
assertion that it leaves you empowered is a weak assertion.  You would
paradoxically in this case be much more empowered if the recipient did
the escrowing silently after receipt by decrypting and storing his
mail folder with an escrowed storage key.  Of course it would be nice
if this policy was advised in the public key also, to at least warn
you, in case you mistook the persons email address as a private
account.  (Some ISPs have names which look similar to some companies
names,... domain names ending in .com, if you are not familiar with
the company name).

I submit for the above reasons that this overriding feature will in
the long term me fairly meaningless.  What is the practical individual
empowerment transferred in being able to override something in the
sure knowledge that it will thereby be bounced and not delivered.

I strongly disagree for reasons stated in paragraph [1] above.
