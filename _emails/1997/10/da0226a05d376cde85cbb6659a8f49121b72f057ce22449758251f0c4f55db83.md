Last October, Sammer was being sued for copyright infringement and he claimed
in court papers that he doesn't censor content on C2's ISP. Literally at the
same time he pulled the plug on a C2 account for publishing a Web page
critical of one of Sameer's associates. Here's Sameer's e-mail to that
account:

You'd think that a pathologically litigious liar would know better than
to use terms like "illegal libel"...

Soon after this incident Parekh settled the copyright infringement suit,
pulled the plug on C2net's ISP business, and switched to peddling
(questionable) software.
