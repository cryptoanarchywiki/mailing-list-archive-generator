Meaning nothing against Declan personally, this "my deadline is tonight" is
one of the reasons I almost never read news magazines anymore.

(I stupidly bought a copy of something "Time" calls "Time Digital," as it
seemed to have some of my acquaintances in it. I should've spotted the jive
by the title on the cover, "Our Exclusive Ranking of the Cyber Elite." Lots
of one-line quoting of pundits, shots of the overexposed geekbabe Pohlese,
and fatuous nonsense about what it means to be rich in Silicon Valley. I
wouldn't have believed it could be possible,  but "Time Digital" is far,
far worse than "Wired." Here's to hoping it dies a merciful death in the
next few months.)
