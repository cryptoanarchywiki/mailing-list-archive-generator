Brian didn't come back to the US with Lucky as he wanted to develop
strong crypto applications and did not want to have to contend with export
restrictions. He currently has a desk in the offices of a major Dutch ISP,
XS4ALL, so he is nice and close to the backbone and thus has great
connectivity.

Cheerio,
