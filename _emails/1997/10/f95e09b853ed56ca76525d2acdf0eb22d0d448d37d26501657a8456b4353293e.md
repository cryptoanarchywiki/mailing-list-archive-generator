In just a few minutes, we'll be starting the online town hall meeting with
Rep. David Dreier (R-CA). 

Dreier is a key member of Congress for the net community: he's on the
Rules committee, which has the fate of SAFE in its hands.  He's also been
a leader in integrating Congressional committees and the net.
