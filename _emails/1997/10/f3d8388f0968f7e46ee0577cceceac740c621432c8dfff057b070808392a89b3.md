Lock-N-Load!!

I wish for once one of the spineless members of the press would ask:

"How many people have died from Terrorism in the last 10yrs?"

Let's be generious and say 10,000 world wide (more like 2,000 but lets not
quibble over numbers).

So we are at 1,000/year world wide. Now only a fraction of those are
actually Americans say 50-100/year.

Now how do they justify the establishment of a police state to save 50-100
lives?!? More Americans die every year from slipping on bars of soap!

Our problem here is not that Assholes are running Washington (Washington
has always been run by assholes) are problem is the Press has turned into
the sphincter of the powers that be.
