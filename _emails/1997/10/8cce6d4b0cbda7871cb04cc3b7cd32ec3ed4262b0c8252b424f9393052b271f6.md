Here is a method to render Man in the Middle audible on a telephone
connection.

Before speech can be encrypted, it is digitized and compressed.  It
is turned into digital packets.  There is some choice in the size
and other properties of the digital packets.

Suppose that Bob's computer from time to time formulates a plan to
do groups of a particular size and form, and sends Ann's computer a
hash of that plan and the DH negotiated shared secret.

Malloc (the man in the middle) cannot send this hash to Ann's computer
for Ann would discover the shared secret she is using is not the same
as the shared Bob is using.

So his computer must formulate its own plan, and send its own hash, 
which will not agree with Bob's plan, because Bob's computer does
not reveal the plan except by actually sending the packets.

So malloc must decompress Bob's speech packets, repacketize them, 
and recompress them,

Often he will not be able to send off a packet, until he has received 
two of Bob's packets.

So this triples the delay, and increases the speech degradation.

This should quite noticeable, noticeable enough to provoke Bob
and Ann into verifying their connection by reading the hash
digits of their shared secret.
