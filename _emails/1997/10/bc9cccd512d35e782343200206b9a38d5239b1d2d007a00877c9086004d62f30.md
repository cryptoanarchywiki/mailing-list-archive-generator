My explicit point was about what happens to plaintext _after_ it has been
received. Not an exceptionable point, it seems to me. CMR doesn't tell
anybody anything about who later sees the plaintext (it can't, which was my
point).

And CMR of course does not actually stop the practice of requiring
employees to physically "escrow" keys. I would expect that most companies
now requiring employees to deposit copies of their keys may well continue
to do so.

(And I'll bet the CMR keys are _also_ required to be escrowed...the CMR
keys are too valuable not to be copied multiple times.)

Finally, I stand by my point that it introduces security weaknesses in the
model.
