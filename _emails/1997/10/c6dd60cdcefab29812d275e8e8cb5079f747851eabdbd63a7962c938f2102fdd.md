It is intruiging to observe how alarmed certain companies get about
Microsoft's methods (as though sellers of bundled MS software couldn't
themselves just say "no" to such business proposals, without the
government's assistance), and how Billg (and his legal advisors) deal with
the govmt as they get further and more precisely investigated.  It should
be instructive and inspiring for everyone else, when MS wins, to see how
(if) they do it.

I would sympathize, but Billg is a great believer in "lawful" ways of doing
things, often cooperating in regard of hiring practices and monopoly
watch-dogs, among other things, so it is of great interest to me to see how
he deals with these "lawful" types who believe they have cause to stick it
to him.  'Tis a fine line he walks, between supporting the methods of The
Law, using its services, and also being highly successful in beyond the
limits set forth in the Official U.S. Rules for Success, Section 0.123, p.
26.930.  Anyway, it's all "for the customer", you know.
