  From Privacy Protection for the Individual to the Government Choice
in SnoopWare. Is it possible to do that while keeping your panties on?
Perverted minds want to know...

  True. This is why it seems all the more odd that PGP leapt over the
obvious to introduce *exactly* what Lying Jackoff Fuck Louis J. Freeh
is asking for--***___IMMEDIATE___*** access to communications.
  Corporate Message Recovery amounts to a _Real-Time_Wiretap_ on email
communications. 

Bonus Question: "Why would a government agency bother with getting a
  court order to _use_ a key they are already in possession of, and
  how would we know if they use it, if they don't have to go to an
  outside source to get possession of it?"

Bonus Prize: One freeh bomb.

Bonus Stupid Question: "Why don't you give me your life savings, to 
  hold for you, and I will only spend it after getting permission
  from someone who won't know whether I am spending it, or not,
  anyway."

Bonus Stupid Prize: One freeh-dumb.

  The government is quite simply trying to poke enough holes in a
variety of privacy/security areas, so that they can shine 'a thousand
points of light' into our private affairs and communications.
  In order to spy on everyone in a corporation, would you rather have
to break a thousand keys, or just one key? Hmmm...tough question...
