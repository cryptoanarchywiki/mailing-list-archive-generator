Hey, the jokes from Anonymous(ses) and Dmitri M. Vulis are the
only reason I _read_ cpunks anymore!  Oh yeah-- and that 
hilarious spoof about PGP, Inc. putting GAK-friendly features
into their product.  It's so funny that people fall for that
old "PGP is in with the government" gag every time it comes
around.


Also, I'm looking for a job, I think.  Or else a good 
university to go to.


But mostly I'm just reading the hilarious Anonymous posts and 
spoofs.


Regards,

Zooko
