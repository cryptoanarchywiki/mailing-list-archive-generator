Now that we're considering (within the IETF OpenPGP standardisation
framework) the prospect of having a separate communications key, and
storage key, there are some aspects of communications keys which are
currently less than ideal because of their current misuse to also
function as storage keys.

This argues for a new functionality to be given to communication only
keys.  This is all tied up with the idea of Perfect Forward Secrecy
(PFS), which is basically the statement of the fact that
communications keys are more sensitive than storage keys, because your
attacker by definition has a copy of the encrypted communication.
(You're sending over an open network where copying all traffic is a
low cost exercise for a savvy system cracker, or spook, or industrial
espionage).  

In contrast an attacker often will have to break into your premises to
obtain the data protected by your storage keys.  Another aditional
vulnerability of communication keys is that the US government is very
interested in obtaining copies of them via their "key escrow"/"key
recovery"/GAK initiative.  The strongest anti-GAK statement you can
make is to use forward secrecy.  I've raised this point before, but
the meme doesn't seem to have penetrated yet.

It ties in quite well with what is in my view proper handling of
communication keys.  If we can break the tie with one key being used
for both storage and communication, we can start to reflect in the
protocol better security practice in the handling of communication
keys.

Forward secrecy is one way of looking at it.  It doesn't have to be
real interactive forward secrecy as you might get in an SSH session,
or an SSL session, or some of the IPSEC standards, though these are
other examples which could server as examples showing that forward
secrecy is a good idea, for anyone who would like to argue against it.

The basic principle is that you want to have communication keys which
don't live for a long time.  So one form of weak forward secrecy you
could have would be to mark your El Gamal or RSA communications for
much more frequent update, by giving it a short expiry date.  Say once
per week.

Some people currently do this manually anyway.  For example see Dave
Wagner's web page (www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/) where he describes what
he does with keys.  (He has a long term signature only key which he
uses to sign short lived "communication only" keys which he discards
after expiry).  What I am arguing for essentially is building this
kind of improved communication key handling into the OpenPGP spec for
keys marked as "communication only".


In addition I think it would be nice to enable a new kind of
communications key which is based on discrete log so that people who
choose to use PGP protocols for more interactive email transfer
protocols than SMTP can generate keys very quickly.  I was originally
thinking that this would have to be DH, but perhaps you can simulate
DH PFS with El Gamal by securely wiping the private parameters of
expired communications keys, and keeping the public modulus and g
value.  (This has similarities with the quick method in PGP5.x of
generating El Gamal keys with precomputed shipped primes that you
already have).  The advantage being that you may be trying to generate
keys frequently, so you may not want to wait for a full new 4096 bit
El Gamal or 2048 bit RSA key generation, when you are not anticipating
the sudden delay in sending messages.


I was originally thinking it would be done by having a new DH key type
(in addition to RSA, El Gamal, DSA).  

(Incidentally Hal, you may recognise in this the reason for some of my
annoyance that PGP Inc is mislabelling El Gamal as "DH" -- with my
earlier ideas on this proposal there would have been a _real_ DH.  It
also gets around objections to do with not being able to decide what
DH keys are (as they are negotiated not randomly generated directly)
which Hal raised as a reason why PFS (at least with DH) would disallow
functionality where key capabilities are included in the public
communications key encrypted packet, the last time this was discussed.
Clearly you could work around this restriction if you had to -- just
include the information in an extra packet encrypted with the
contained key and some symmetric algoirthm for example, though this
may limit algorithm choice at least for that packet).

You can use PFS in an asynchronous "where possible" mode for
non-interactive email transport situations.  That is you would perhaps
send new communications keys parameters with each message that defines
in it's key sub-packet preferrences that it is capable of using
communications only keys, and will be able to handle "recipients comms
key as part of message".  This might make sense where comms keys are
being updated too quickly to burden a key server with, or where comms
keys are not public (an aditional use for Hal's described no-export
flag for signatures, but here applied to communications keys), but are
specific to that communicating pair. (For paranoid people who are
changing comms keys on each receipt, you would need to do this).

As soon as one party has replied to a mail from the other, you can
switch to forward secrecy.  This would lead to emails such as "hi, can
you reply to this message please".  These are kind of similar to the
"hi can you send me your public key" you get back from people when you
haven't included your public key in your mail to them, and they don't
have access to a keyserver.

You can also then use this new "communications only" key setup to cope
with fully interactive email delivery for systems using email
transports other than standard SMTP.

You should probably overlap sending communications keys if you aren't
relying on keyservers due to frequency of key update, or for
convenience for people without access to keyservers, so that the
person sending you email is less likely to have no current
communications key for you if you are using keys sent in the message.
So towards the end of the month (if you had a policy of using
communications only keys with monthly updates) replacing keys monthly
start sending the next months communications key also, marked as not
for use until it's starting date.

(The use of very transient communications keys I think would imply a
need for two communications keys: you'll need a long term
communications key which is used for initial non-PFS mail in order to
set up PFS.)

With the separation of storage and communications keys all the
architecture has much better security decisions:

- We are able to treat communications with variable amounts of
  sensitivity, by giving different key expiry time periods to comms only
  keys.

- We are also able to secure and escrow our long term data storage in
  mail box folders, or PGP encrypted files without having to live with
  a GAKware compliant implementation of snoopware.  We can storage
  escrow keys appropriately without all the name calling and bad PR
  caused by enraged crypto anarchists, and crypto consultants.

You _know_ it makes sense :-)
