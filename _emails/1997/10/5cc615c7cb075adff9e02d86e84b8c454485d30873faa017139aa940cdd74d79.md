If you haven't heard already, there's a Washington, DC-area cypherpunks
meeting this weekend. It's Sunday, November 2 at 4 pm in the NW portion of
the city. Topics sure to be discussed include what's happening in Congress,
PGP and message recovery, and the government's key-escrow-fest scheduled
for next week. Simon Davies and Peter Neumann are likely to show up as well.

Marc Rotenberg and his wife are hosting. Their home is near the National
Cathedral, between Connecticut and Wisconsin avenues. Plenty of parking.
Walk is 12-15 mins from the Woodley Park/Nat'l Zoo Metro stop on the red
line. Email me for directions if you're interested.

-Declan
