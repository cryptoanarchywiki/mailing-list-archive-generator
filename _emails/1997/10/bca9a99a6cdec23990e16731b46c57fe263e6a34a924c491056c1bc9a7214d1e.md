Bullshit!  Fuck the lawyers!

By wasting time and money in the courts bickering about the stupid laws that 
buffoons in Congress pass in order to justify their existence, we are only 
ignoring the real issue: you cannot use the system to change the system.

What amazes me is the amount of time and energy well-intentioned folks piss 
away trying to convince legislators to "do the right thing".  By paying 
attention to these idiots, we are in effect legitimatizing their actions.  
If enough people come to their senses and ignored this bogus legislation, we 
will all be much better off in much less time.

Exactly.

Spend the money on deploying the technology.  Don't waste it lining the 
pockets of scum legislators and their litigious brethren.

The big question is do PGP, RSA, Netscape et al have the balls to stand up
for themselves and tell the DC politcos to fuck off?  We can only hope...
