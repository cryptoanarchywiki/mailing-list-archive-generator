I'm looking for a source of modems that can be used in non-US sites
that support built-in encryption or at least strong authentication
(e.g. token cards would be great, or something stronger than 
simple password+dialback.)  A box sitting on the RS232 side of the
modem would probably work fine too, as long as it didn't interfere much
with regular traffic.

One of my customers would like a managed router network, but they're paranoid
(probably reasonably so :-), and our router management folks insist on 
modem access to the router console port so they can do things like 
reconfigure routers or reboot them when they're hosed.  The customer views
dialback as cute but crackable, and would probably accept one-time passwords
like S/Key but not basic reusable passwords.
				Thanks!
