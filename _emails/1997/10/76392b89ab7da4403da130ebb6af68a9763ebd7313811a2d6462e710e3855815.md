No, it doesn't - your definition of democracy is a simplistic if not
childish view intended to cast democracy in the worst possible light
imaginable. What you describe is a democracy which has no bill of rights or
explicit limitations on the issues that the democratic body can vote on.
Obviously there is nothing in the definition of a democracy that prevents
those founding the democracy from stating:

"Congress shall make no law respecting ..."

or 

"The rights of the people to .... shall not be infringed."

Grow up.

You've proved nothing except your a priori dislike for democracy because you
want to convince others you are an angel.
