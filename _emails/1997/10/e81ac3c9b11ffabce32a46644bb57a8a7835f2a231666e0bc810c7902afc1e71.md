When I suggested using code words to exchange the checksum, I thought you
would have to use them in one-time-pad mode to be secure.  The following
argument makes me think you can reuse them several times, changing them at
about the same rate as you would change a symmetric crypto key.

Assume that the contents of the paper are secret between Alice and Bob.
When Alice calls Bob, she reads the word coresponding to the first digit of
the checksum.  Either Mallory is in the middle or he isn't.  If he isn't,
no problem.  The word list remains secure.

If he is in the middle, he has 15 chances in 16 of being caught on the
first exchange.  He only survives if the first digit of the Alice-Mallory
connection is the same as the first digit of the Mallory-Bob connection.
He now knows the word for one value and can continue to play 1 out of 16
times.

The probability he can survive the next word that Bob reads to Alice is
harder to calculate.  He can survive if the second digit of the Mallory-Bob
connection is the same as the second digit of the Alice-Mallory connection,
or the second digit of the Alice-Mallory connection is the same as the
first digit on that connection.  Without doing the math, Mallory's survival
probability becomes very small as the exchange continues.

If Alice and Bob catch Mallory, they talk about the weather and exchange a
new list by email.  If they don't, there is a very high probability that
the word list has not been compromised, and they can safely continue to use
it for the next call.


BTW - I really like John's idea of doing another exchange later in the
conversation.  Perhaps something like, "You know, I was dancing the Foxtrot
with my wife 9 days ago at 5AM."
