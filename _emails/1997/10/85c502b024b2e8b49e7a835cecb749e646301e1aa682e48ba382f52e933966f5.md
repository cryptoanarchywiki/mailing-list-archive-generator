    The lead editorial, the stated opinion of the paper 
    itself, in this mornings NYTimes slams F[reeh.uck]'s
    initiative as "crossing the line" and that Clinton
    "needs to stamp out a bad idea."

    strong words, newspaper policy editorial, important
    words.  The NYTimes actually has a clue, a strong 
    clue. 

    support the NYTimes!  The NYTimes syndicate feeds
    thousands of the US papers, particularly the small
    town papers and is considered gospel by many.

 The Clinton Administration has proposed several
 unworkable plans over the years to keep powerful
 encryption programs that scramble telephone and computer
 messages out of the hands of foreign terrorists and
 criminals.  But it has never tried to put the need to
 eavesdrop on criminals above the privacy rights of
 ordinary Americans.  Last month the F.B.I.  Director,
 Louis Freeh, crossed that line by urging Congress to
 outlaw the manufacture and distribution of encryption
 programs the Government cannot instantly crack....
 
 ...The plan is unworkable because uncrackable encryption
 software is readily available abroad.  Congress could
 try to forbid Americans to use any unbreakable
 encryption, regardless of who makes it.  But that would
 trample on rights that Americans jealously protect to
 communicate free of Washington's interference.
 
 The best way to reduce many types of industrial and
 financial crime is to provide citizens powerful
 encryption so they can communicate without fear of
 corporate spies and thieves....  
 ...
 Before encryption controls pick up more momentum, the
 White House needs to stamp out a bad idea.
