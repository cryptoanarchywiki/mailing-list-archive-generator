Huh?   Okay, PGP uses IDEA for transit keys.  These are encrypted to two 
different PGP public keys.   

These are only used once.  (Well, you make that assumption, but with even a 
decent PRNG it's a reasonably safe assumption)

The signature keys (in the proposed method) are the PGP keys (either RSA or 
DH, it's not important) are the personal keypairs of each person.  The 
company doesn't keep a copy of these.  They can sign with this in an 
unforgable manner.  (Well, in practice I doubt that's true, because I've seen 
very few places that have even mild local-workstation security, but that's 
besides the point)

Is there a problem here?

- From the description Jon gave of the system, you can designate anyone as
the 
other key-id to encrypt to in your signature block.  (Or whatever that part 
of the key is called).  The guy in the next cube, your boss, one company-wide 
key, etc.

So yes, in theory this could be used to implement GAK.  Supposedly in the 
version of PGP in use it's trivial to remove this extra recipient from the 
list of encryption keys.  It's not even needed if you don't have that key on 
your ring.  (From what Jon said)

When you compalin about use of storage keys/communication keys your clouding 
the issue.

The storage keys can be (and probably are in some cases) simply pgp encrypted 
files, as if they were in transit.  I tend to encrypt some files on my hard 
drive with pgp, by encrypting to myself and signing  so that onyl I can 
decrypt them, and I've got record that I did create the archive.  I can see 
this being done in a company to simplify shared storage usage without 
security problems.  Using the multiple recipient option your recovery key-id 
can be used to decrypt these files.  Of course, if they're modified, they 
can't be resigned, so you'd know, but...

This is a *simple* solution that eliminates problems with encrypting hard 
drives, etc. 

Where is the problem with this system?  This is software that (according to 
Jon's claim) at least one company has decided they need for their security, 
and it keeps the number of pass phrases that employees need to memorize at 
one - their PGP key.

Why not just encrypt it to yourself with PGP?  Isn't that simpler?  Add a 
recipient of the recovery id.  Boss, coworker, person's key in another 
division, whatever.  Everybody gets different storage keys.  No need to worry 
about accidently compromising one of the storage keys (IDEA symmetric keys, 
of course).  You then just need to keep the secret  halfs of the public keys 
secure.  Not a big deal if you have the rest of the system working.

>You shouldn't be recovering transient messages, you should be
>recovering stored data.

What the hell is the difference?  Speed of recovery?

Give an example of the difference between what he's doing and what you would 
propose. Otherwise you're just rejecting this system blindly.
