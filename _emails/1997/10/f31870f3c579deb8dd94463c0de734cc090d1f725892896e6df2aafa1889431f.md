This is interesting.  One nice feature is that there doesn't need to
be a standardized payment arrangement with all remailers, just the one
you use for your entry point.  And, there's nothing that prevents many
remailer networks from overlapping.  (Actually, the geometry could
create some neat problems.)

This would be fairly easy to set up, not even really needing client
software modifications.

However, it does have a "commons" problem.  No remailer operator has
an incentive to provide really good service.  They are all encouraged
to provide the bare minimum remailer service and take advantage of the
other remailers in the network.

For example, what would encourage somebody to have a 24 x 7 remailer
service with continuous staffing?  This would be desirable because
when the bad guys kick down the door, there is somebody awake to pull
the plug.  There are a zillion other features which won't happen if
there isn't a proper incentive.
