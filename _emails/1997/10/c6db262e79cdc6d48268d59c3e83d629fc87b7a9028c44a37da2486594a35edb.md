	I would expect this kind of paging to be encrypted under the
same CAVE or A5 encryption as encrypts the rest of the call setup, but
don't have the IS standards handy here to check.  At the very least it
would be much more complex to intercept than regular beeper paging
because of the much more complex signal multiplexing and modulation. 
Regular POCSAG paging is simple FSK, receivable on an umodified scanner,
whilst CDMA and TDMA tranmissions require special demodulator hardware
and DSP software not available at Radio Shack (except as modifiable
phones).   But more significant, like REFLEX, the system generally knows
where a specific mobile phone is located and sends the paging only to
that cell site whereas regional and national paging systems used with
conventional beepers send the message to tens to hundreds of
transmitters scattered all over the place making it possible to
intercept messages at locations far removed from the intended recipiant
(continent wide in the case of the satellite feeds for the paging
transmitters used by many regional and national paging carriers).

	Flex and Reflex are physical, link and transport level protocols
for sending paging data over the rf link.  They are not an operating
system.  Motorola does offer implementations of these protocols
integrated with a real time OS, but properly they are link protocols and
not an OS.  Much of the common carrier paging infrastructure in the US
is being converted to flex on the existing VHF and UHF narrow band
channels, and clearly Motorola is aiming at that market.  Whether Moto
put their flex stack on top of OS-9 I don't offhand know.  GSM is a
completely different link protocol that has nothing to do with flex at
all - so a flex pager would not be able compatible with GSM (although
some DSP based dual mode wireless hardware exists that will do various
combinations of otherwise incompatible air interfaces). Flex is m-ary
FSK (4 level FSK) on narrow band carriers, and GSM is TDMA BPSK on much
wider carriers BTW.. Motorola has aimed their paging applications
software at the 68HC11 family in the past, but may well be upgrading to
32 bit stuff...

	There are lots of cards that will allow PDAs to receive existing
common carrier flex and POCSAG paging streams - and flex explicitly is
capable of forwarding binary data unaltered making it pretty trivial to
implement end to end unescrowed secure messaging over the existing
VHF/UHF paging infrastructure. That nobody has is a tribute to the FUD
factor...
