You keep talking as if your CDR proposal is other than vaporware.  So 
far as I have seen you don't have a proposal, you have a wish.

It does seem rather unrealistic.  It would essentially involve
replacing the entire email infrastructure, at a significant cost, and
a rather sweeping suite of further laws that restrict the use of
encryption to only PGP, forbid me running sendmail on my linux box,
etc, etc

This implies a law against using any other form of crypto, period.  
If such a law is passable the exemption for PGP's protocol will 
really be immaterial.  That is, Yes, under an extremely draconian 
regieme, extremely draconian things are possible.

"Tinpotdictatorsville" is not a useful counterexample, because the 
TPD can mandate anything, including no use of crypto at all.

Implies that *all* other forms of communication have been outlawed.  
Completely unrealistic.

Adam, it is a complete and utter waste of time to debate this. 

What would *not* be a waste of time would be more concrete proposals.  
Whether PGP implements something is a separate question -- I would 
like to get back to the question of designing a better email 
encryption system.

Your reencryption scheme fails because of the management of the short
term encryption keys, among other things.  Here's another approach I
will toss out, without thinking through:

How about formalizing superencryption, or tunneling? That is, treat
CMR traffic as a transport medium for messages that are themselves
already encrypted.  The "key" idea here is to allow layering of non
CMR traffic over CMR traffic.  All the code for both is obviously
already in PGP, with a little glue and perhaps some minor protocol
mods...
