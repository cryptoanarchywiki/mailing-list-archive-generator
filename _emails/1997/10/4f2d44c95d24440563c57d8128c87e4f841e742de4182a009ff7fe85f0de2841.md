*** Azalea releases encryption software

Azalea Software has just released three new encryption and security
products: DESTools v1.5, BlowfishTools v1.5 and SHATools v1.0. All
three packages are SDK's (software developers kits) targeting Windows
developers who need to add encryption and security features to the
applications they write. DESTools and BlowfishTools provide
encryption and decryption based on the DES (Data Encryption Standard)
and Blowfish algorithms respectively. DES provides 56-bit keys and is
used extensively in banking and finance. (PR Newswire) For the full
