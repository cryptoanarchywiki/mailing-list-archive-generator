An interesting question indeed. This is something that needs to be 
carefully considered by all concerned especially since, once the LEA has a 
copy of a private key, there is no way to stop them from using it to 
decrypt =any= document that was encrypted to it. This is very different 
from a wiretap, where the court allows the LEA to listen in to 
conversations over a specific period at a specific location. A closer 
analogy would be to require all telephone conversations to be recorded, and 
the wiretap would be used to listen to all these recorded conversations.

Indeed. I just recieved a copy of pgpmail 4.5 that my boss purchased. I'm 
supposed to look this over and see how we can implement it. Upon briefly 
perusing the documentation, I'd say that I prefer this version to pgp 5x 
since it allows conventional cryptography, (with idea rather than DES!) and 
also makes it easy to encrypt to a group of people. This functionality is 
really what we need it for more than anything else.
