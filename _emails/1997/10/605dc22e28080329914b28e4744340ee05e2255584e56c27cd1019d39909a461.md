This is *almost* right.  We need to add one more thing,
though:

1.      Alice calls Mallory, thinking she's calling Bob.
She reads the first three digits to him.  He makes the
connection fall apart.  At the same time, Mallory calls Bob,
pretending to be Alice, and causes the connection to fall
apart at the same time.

2.      Alice calls Bob again, re-establishes their
connection, and talks to him.  Both seem to have had the
same thing happen, so it's believeable that it was just
noise on the line.  (Where I am, this isn't so uncommon that
it would imply an active attack.)

3.      Mallory now knows three of these words in the
dictionary.  He lies low for the next few calls before
trying the same trick again, until he learns most or all the
dictionary entries.

This implies a couple of things:  First, Alice and Bob
ought to be suspiscious of line noise that conveniently
clobbers them during reading of checksums.  Second, Alice
and Bob shouldn't keep the same 16-word dictionary forever.
If they change it once a week, this may be enough to make
the attack I describe above unworkable.

Note that this all works only when the phones/dictionaries
are used only by single users.

I also made a poorly-thought-through comment about using
6-digit hex secrets, and adding or XORing them into the
checksums.  This is vulnerable to a trivial attack, of
course.  The thing is, this doesn't need to be as complex or
cryptographically secure as a hash function or MAC, because
of the way it's used.  We can probably also expect
one-day-only keys for this application.

I can think of dozens of things that *ought* to work here,
and still be strong enough to resist the limited possible
attacks, but I can't seem to convince myself of the security
of any that are simple enough to use with a calculator.  If
I settled on one, it would be

New checksum = (((old checksum * C0) mod P)+ C1) mod 2^{64}.

where P is a random 64-bit prime, C0 is a random 64-bit
number between 0 and P-1 inclusive, and C1 is a random
64-bit number.  If P,C0, and C1 are all unknown, I *think*
that's secure.  An attacker given the high-order half of
this doesn't seem to have the information needed to guess
its low-order half on a different checksum, nor to reliably
learn the value of P.

This is essentially the IBC-Hash message authentication
code, which is provably secure if the key is used once.
I can't see a way that this could be attacked in this
application, given one-time use of the keys.  Can anyone
else?  (I may be missing something obvious again.)

I wish I could claim this, but it's been around for a while.
Didn't some of the PGPphone people come up with this idea?
(Or was it users of older, government-issued secure phones?)
