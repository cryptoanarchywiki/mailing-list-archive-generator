Greg,

What's your take on repeated delay in Jim's sentencing:

1. A squeeze on Jim to finger co-conspirators.

2. Weak case, must use procedure to punish.

3. To let time served be the sentence.

4. Jim was up to something worse now being discovered
(like 5 below).

5. Jim is a secret gov agent, now feet up in Tacoma IRS 
laughing at those who fell for suckerbait, screwball AP 
written by IRS as a sting (a recent book package to Jim was 
returned marked "Not in Jail").

6. The court was hoodwinked by IRS, too, and the AUSA
is preparing an indictment of the stingers and federal defenders
and who knows who else that was in on it.

7. Secret Agent Jim is squealing on his double-crossing
secret agents, cutting a deal with whoever else is double-
crossing whomever. He's going down, they're going down,
we're going down, the whole country's going down; Up the
Revolution!
