Some of us use the old-fashioned way:

:0
* ^From.*bwalk.dm.com
   /dev/null

My procmail log has a bunch of /dev/null entries coming from the unedited
Cypherpunks list. Since spam gets tagged and filtered separately, it looks
like they're V*l*s - he's the only one I know of on cpunx-unedited who's
auto-killed by my mail filters without some kind of notification.

I'll look more closely in the future. Not at his posts, but at the log.
