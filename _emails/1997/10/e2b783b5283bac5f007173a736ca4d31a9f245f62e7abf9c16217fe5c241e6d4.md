Or lots of encrypted old email that contains useful information.
Especially in a larger corporate environment, where an email system is
deployed that uses a proprietary message store (like Microsoft Mail or
Microsoft Exchange), people tend to use the mailboxes as storage
containers.  It gets worse if these isn't a way to get the messages out
of the vendor's message store conveniently -- if you want to keep old
messages around, they _have_ to be stored in the vendor's message store.
