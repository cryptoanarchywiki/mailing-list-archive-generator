                BOY SHOOTS SISTER FOR TALKING ON PHONE TOO LONG

     ORANGE PARK, Florida (AP) -- A 14-year-old boy shot his sister for
     talking on the telephone too long, a law enforcement official said.
     
     The boy, who was not identified because of his age, was charged with
     attempted murder. His 15-year-old sister was treated for a gunshot
     wound to her chest and released from a hospital.
     
     The boy said that his sister was getting on his nerves for talking
     on the phone too long, the sheriff's office said.
     
     He said he took his mother's .22-caliber revolver from a locked box
     in her bedroom. The girl was reading a book when she was shot
     Monday. When officers arrived, the boy was talking on the phone.
     
     "I could understand a temper thing, but this kid had the gun for
     four or five hours before he went into his sister's bedroom and shot
     at her twice," said sheriff's Sgt. Wes Gronikowski.
