This requirement tries to enforce something which can not be enforced by
technical means.  That is, when you send another person some data, there is
no technical way you can prevent them from using it however they want.  For
example, a user can always program his filters (given something like
procmail) to send decrypted data anywhere he wants.

The idea that you can control what users do with data thru technical means
is the most common flaw I see when people think about security.


N.B. I applaud Adam's direction of building the data recovery businesses
need without helping 3rd parties engage in undetected snooping.  Keeping
the decryption keys (if data is not stored in the clear) near the
legitimate copies seems to be a useful step in this direction.
