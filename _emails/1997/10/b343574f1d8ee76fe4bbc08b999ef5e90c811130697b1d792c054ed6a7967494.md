But what if you're out at lunch or on vacation, or just moved, and 
no-one can read the message because they don't have the key? We must 
have GMR encryption to FBI keys now, just in case!

(That's not entirely facetious, I could see them making this kind of
argument if CMR is widely adopted... it's not Big Brother, it's just
another useful public service).
