*** U.S. urged to do more to fight computer threats

A presidential panel is urging the government to increase its efforts
to combat computer terrorism, including doubling current spending of
$250 million by fiscal year 1999, the Washington Post said Tuesday.
The panel said annual federal spending to prevent hackers from using
computer networks to sabotage U.S. infrastructure and ensure computer
safety should reach $1 billion by 2004. The President's Commission on
Critical Infrastructure Protection, established a year ago after a
Justice Department review of vulnerability to terrorism, delivered a
classified 269-page report to the White House Monday, the Post said.

Powell lingered. "How's Earth?" 
It was a conventional enough question and Muller gave the 
conventional answer, "Still spinning."
