Two problems.  First, not all mail clients let you archive the mail in
a different form than how it arrived.  Netscape 3 worked like this, maybe
4 too.  If the mail comes in encrypted just to an employee key, that is
how it will be stored, and no business access is possible.

Second, what if an employee doesn't come back from vacation?  You've got
messages sitting in his inbox which go back three weeks.  All encrypted
to his personal key, which is gone.  It's been long enough that the
senders may not have backups any more.  It's all lost, and at best the
company is going to put its partners and customers to a great deal of
inconvenience by making them re-send everything they've sent in the last
three weeks, not to mention making the company look incompetent.
