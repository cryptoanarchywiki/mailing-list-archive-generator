I agree that the civil liberties side of PGP is of no interest to
corporations...in fact, it scare them a great deal. Talking about how Hamas
is using PGP to communicate so that the Zionist entity government cannot
successfully wiretap the freedom fighters is not something IS managers like
to hear about.

I agree that PGP, Inc. is apparently recasting itself as a supplier to IS
departments and bean counters.

If you are implying that my words are "sloganeering and histrionics," I
think you're way off-base.

I suggest you start reading the points being debated in more detail, and
think about the deeper issues.
