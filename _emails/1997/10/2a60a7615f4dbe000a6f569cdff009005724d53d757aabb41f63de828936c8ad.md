Well lets take the flip side of this: Who in their right mind encrypts
ultra valuable company information and then leaves the plain text on their
computer?? I have an outbox full of encrypted messages that are encrypted
to both the recipient and to my key (Encrypt-To-Self Option). If you are
going through the trouble of encryption why would you want to leave plain
text lying around??? One needs to remember that e-mail is not just
communication but communication *and* storage.

I have to disagree, see above.

I have seen no evidence that encrypting to multiple recipients is any less
secure than encrypting to one. If there are serious security implications
in doing so then it affects *all* versions of PGP and not just 5.5. I find
it odd that this issue is only now being brought up with 5.5 and never
mentioned with previous versions.

One thing I would like to see added to this set-up is secret sharing of
the corporate private key. That way one person could not unilaterally
access the data but would require the agreement of several people (say 3
of 5 department heads). I think this would provide enhanced physical
security of the key and personal privacy (Joe in IMS can't snoop the mail
just because he is board). I have made some mention of this in the past to
PGP but don't know what if any work has been done in this area. I have
been working on a small utility that would let a user do this with his own
private key. Perhaps if I ever get some free time I can finish it up.
