Anybody notice that the Big Grey is putting the screws to many of 
the agencies, etc. which aren't already under their control?
Has anyone noticed a common denominator between those whom Big
Grey is maneuvering into key power positions?

has been passed, if our next President is from the ranks of the
Big Grey?

Question: "Who will be the most important government figure in the 
         U.S. if the Y2K problem leads to financial chaos?"
Tongue in cheek Answer: Inspector #7. [Mattress Division]
