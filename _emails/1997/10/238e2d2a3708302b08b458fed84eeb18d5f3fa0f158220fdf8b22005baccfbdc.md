I'm fairly sure this is not the case.  The reason I think that this is
not the case is because Jon described two flags which go in the GAK
compliancy sub-packet:

Flag1:  this flag is an advisory note to the person who obtains a
	public key which has the GAK compliancy self signature
	sub-packet; it tells the person about to use the key that the
	company the person who owns this public key works for would
	like it if you would "please" encrypt to the contained
	corporate snoopware master key.

Flag2:	this flag is the same as the flag1 above plus it is a big
	brotherish/little brotherish warning that if you _don't_
	encrypt to the GAK compliancy key also, that the recipient
	will not receive the message.

I understood the reason that the recipient will not receive the
message when you don't honour keys with flag2 to be that the SMTP
policy enforcer would either bounce the message, or eat it, or send it
to the company snoopware czar to who can take due note in his employee
dossier collection that this employee is receiving email from
suspicious cypherpunk persons who don't believe in snoopware.

The above functionality is the reason I'm arguing that PGP's method of
implementing corporate snoopware is GAK compliant: clearly the whole
system is ready tailored for GAK.  The only thing left to do is plug
in the governemnts key in the GAK compliancy field, and for the
government to mandate that companies, and deputised ISPs use the
software and the GAK master key.

If/when this GAK compliancy gets used as the architecture for real
live mandatory GAK, the SMTP policy enforcer may be set up to narc out
the suspicious person who doesn't believe in GAK to the Feds/NSA, and
they will then come and lock you up if they can trace your SMTP From
field to you.

This will make a mockery out remailers, because the remailer chain
will also be forced to have the GAK master key in it as enforced by
deputised ISPs running PGP's SMTP policy enforcers with GAK keys
installed as the GAK master key.

Oh, I see what you mean.  The reason I didn't understand is that this
is not how I thought it works.  I think the key is provided right
there in the GAK compliancy field in an inseparable way.  (I could be
wrong on this, but this is the way I read Jon's message).

Even if have misunderstood the way that this key is bundled, it
doesn't really alter the fact that by "choosing" not to encrypt to
messages with the flag2 flag you will know that this is a waste of
time, because your message will not get past the SMTP policy enforcer.
So purposely stripping the key from your key ring, or separating the
key pair when someone sends you them together would just be another
way of exercising the choice PGP is claiming you have in "choosing" to
have your message bounced back at you.  A fairly meaningless "choice".

I would be interested to have this point about the way GAK compliancy
key is bound/bundled with the GAK compliancy sub-packet clarified by a
PGPer, or someone with more understanding of the draft docs, if this
much information is available yet.

I don't think this is so because that would invalidate the semantics
of the flag1 and flag2 flags, which are what instructs PGP to warn you
of this requirement for this key.  The flag is an attribute of the key
itself, though I do suppose you might be able to strip off the
attribute in much the same way as you can remove signatures from keys
with pgp -krs.

I don't think it complicates web of trust.  The only certification you
need of communications keys is for you to sign them with your
signature key.  Your signature key semantics, and the web of trust is
unchanged.

> You can only chain signatures so far before you run into problems,

It will be automatic .. you won't notice because all the OpenPGP
compliant application which supports this proposed (strongly
encouraged MAY, please!) feature will do when it creates a new
communications key is to sign the communications key with your
signature key.  It won't involve third parties re-issuing
certificates.

It is the same way that certification and WoT interacts with
potentially shorter life-span dual use encryption keys at the moment.
The WoT certificates go on your longer life signature key, and it is
you who signs your encryption key.  Same argument, though now applied
to encryption keys marked as "communications only".

512 bit I think is reckoned to be feasible for an academic crack of
similar scale to the recent RSA challenge DES break.  The memory for
the final matrix crunching phase might be the only arguable point.

However, this doesn't really give me 20 years worth of assurance
because, well Rivest and friends encrypted the message "squeamish
ossifrage" back in 1977 or thereabouts, firm in the belief that it
would not be broken for 1000s of years.  Factoring advances have meant
that that ~380 bit keys (squeamish ossifrage was RSA129 digits
decimal) is now relatively easy.  Paul Leyland and friends broke a 384
bit blacknet key as a private attack without massive internet
collaboration.

I'm not sure anyones promising, or has any mathematical proof that new
factoring algorithms won't provide similar factoring speedups.  How
many years are 1024 bit RSA keys good for?  All you can use as
estimators is the current factoring algorithms.  I'm not sure how
certain these estimates are for long term purposes.

In contrast if there is nothin wrong with 3DES nor IDEA, the key space
protects you, modulo Moore's law which is easier to predict.  (Also
modulo quantum computing break-throughs, in both cases, erk!)

Yes.  But memory on workstations is increasing in leaps and bounds.
It is very common now for personal PCs and even laptops to have 32Meg.
A few years ago we were living below the 640k barrier.  Leave it a few
years, and people will have the required memory levels.  A few more
years on from that people will be grizzling about living below the 4Gb
barrier (restriction from using 32 bit addresses).

Anyway, one of the factoring gurus may come up with another novel
implementation or algorithm tweak to tune down memory requirements.
Or a newly discovered faster factoring alorgithm may have huge memory
advantages over current alogirthms.

The future is uncertain.  But it is marginally less uncertain for
well tried and tested symmetric keys ciphers.

Don't think it says it anywhere, but you can combine flags in lots of
logical ways which aren't documented as such, and most of which work
as you might reasonaly extrapoloate them to.  There are single letter
flags for most letters of the alphabet, the full number of
combinations must be quite large.  Quite a few of them mean
*something*.  Some of them are even phonetically pleasing: -feast etc :-)

Signature only might've been enough for backups of stuff in plaintext
on the disk like autoexecs.

Sure.  But you were also talking about autoexecs and other small files
where it could get significant.  The significant lose howver is the
performance -- say you recursively encrypt all the files in a
directory, each to 2 or 3 multiple crypto recipients.  It'll crawl.

I see.  Sounds reasonable.  You should be able to achieve that with
the current dual use PGP keys, or with the new "storage only" keys via
crypto recipients.

If your document is on the Internet, on the web perhaps, you'd need to
be aware of the reduced security in using long term storage keys as
opposed to short term communications keys, but other than that I can't
see a problem.

The point is that where you have a directional communication, you
should treat those keys as sensitive.  Where it is not a directional
communication, you can't, so you lose that extra security; for
applications where this is acceptable, I wouldn't argue for
restricting your ability to do it.

I think I understand what you're saying for shared storage keys.  But
I don't think it's an identical argument at all for communications
keys.

If you define communications keys as short lived highly sensitive
keys, as perhaps in SSL, or SSH (both of which use some forms of
forward secrecy), you can't retain the ability to recover the message
after the fact for security reasons.

However I posit that people don't really want access to the plaintext
stored inside encrypted communications for their own purposes for the
simple reason that they don't have a sendmail log including all the
message bodies.

Together with the security advantages of not being able to decrypt
communications traffic yourself after the fact, this argues that
people who do want full email archives for company legal or snooping
purposes, or just folder for their own use (I know I keep lots of
email in folders) can either store in the clear, or store encrypted
with a storage key, or store with an escrowed storage key, or store
encrypted to multiple storage keys as crypto-recipients as you
suggest.

I don't think it's that theoretical.  Don't PGP have such an encrypted
disk driver for the MAC?  I think this is the way forward for simpler
storage encryption: encrypt the lot.  Saves arguments about forgetting
to encrypt stuff, or forgetting you did decrypt and leaving plaintext
copies around in /tmp or whever as well.

Your suggestion is one reasonable way of acheiving this.  You can also
acheive the same flexibility with an extra indirection with symmetric
storage keys (optionally held in escrow).  In fact I think this is
what later versions of Peter Gutmann's SFS do.  The reason he uses for
this is that it allows you to change your passphrase without
re-encrypting the whole disk, because the _actual_ disk encryption key
is encrypted itself with the hash of your passphrase, rather than
using the hash of the passphrase directly as the key.

Well I agree, I think it's reasonable for us to consider the major
uses, plaintext recovery demands, and security aspects of the
different types of uses for keys: transient communication keys,
storage keys, and signature keys.

It doesn't really matter one way or the other.  You can build
non-hierarchical recovery systems with either method.  (You can escrow
storage keys in your department, just as easily as add second crypto
recipient within your department.  I think the security is basically
the same for escrow or multiple recipient when we're talking about
storage.

The same security equivalence argument applies if you accept the
premise that you need access to transient communications.  I don't
accept this premise.  This premise is a fallacy promulgated by the
likes of Freeh.  If you don't escrow communications keys at all you
gain extra security for the same reason that it is less secure
actually to escrow storage keys, or use multiple recipient as another
way to achieve storage key escrow than to not use storage key escrow.
However with storage you live with this because a) data availibility
is important, and b) the risk isn't as great with storage because your
attacker has to breach physical security to obtain the data from your
disks and tapes.

The suggestions about snooping heirarchy -- who can read who's mail
within the company -- are independent of which architecture you choose
to use to allow access to the mail (escrow storage keys or use
multiple crypto recipient for storage keys).  (This can all be
enforced with similar levels of resistance to bypass by building the
archive and snooping features into the mail client to do this after
decryption).

Where you start to get argument from me is when you start unduly
exposing what should be transient communications keys to construct
this corporate snooping pecking order.

That's what it's all about -- meaningful discourse so that we can
collectively improve each others understanding of the problems at
hand, pointing out flaws in each others arguments until we reach
agreement, eliminating misunderstanding.  With that a clarified
picture of the security issues and best architecture, we can then go
on to design suitable security protocols which best reflect this.

Hey, as long as we steer clear of PGP arguments about mandatory GAK
compliancy, this is all friendly discourse :-) 

On religious arguments: I must admit to strong negative feelings about
PGP Inc or the OpenPGP standard using weaker security methods to
enable GAK compliancy.  My reason for expressing these opinions is the
hope that we can talk PGP out of this big brotherish SMTP policy
enforcer, and associated GAK compliant fields, and to give my input to
try to steer the OpenPGP process away from incorporating said GAK
compliancy field into the standard.

Also as I hope I have explained relatively clearly in my other post
titled:

	Subject: negative security aspects of GAK compliance

that GAK compliancy is independently from political arguments a
security design flaw.  And so I think that we should be able to reject
it on technical grounds alone as a design with weaker security.
