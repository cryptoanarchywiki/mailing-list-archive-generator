Prediction: this bill will be about as effective as outlawing spring.

About 20% of gamblers are 'problem' types who now regularly game illegally
and could careless about the penalties.  Once all on-line casinos offer
real and 'play-money' wagering and strong crypto it will be neigh
impossible for the Feds to know or prove which players are wagering real
money and therefore gambling.  Once Onion and Crowds routers are
operational and widespread the Feds won't even be able to find the casinos,
and even if they do they may not be able to shut them down (especially if
they are built in a distributed fasion).
