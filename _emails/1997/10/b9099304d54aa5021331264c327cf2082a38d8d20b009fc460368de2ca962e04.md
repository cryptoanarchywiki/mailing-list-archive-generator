It sounds like everybody is in agreement, then.  Companies have the
right to ask their employees to give up some privacy, time, and
effort.  You are arguing that many employees will opt to give up their
privacy rights because that choice is preferable to the others they
perceive.  Because there is a large number of such people, it is
likely that large numbers of people will become accustomed to giving
up their privacy and will be sympathetic when other people are forced
to give up their privacy.

Where there may be some disagreement is whether the solution is to
pass even more laws that restrict what choices people may make
or to pursue other solutions.

Given that the governments of the world are the source of nearly all
privacy problems, it seems unlikely that an appeal to government is
likely to be productive.
