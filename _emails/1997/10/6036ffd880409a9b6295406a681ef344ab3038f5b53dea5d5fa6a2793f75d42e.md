> temperature and pressure, and without changing its chemical
> makeup, has been created by researchers at UCLA (James Heath,
> heath@chem.ucla.edu).  The researchers prepare a Langmuir film,
> an ultrathin layer of material on a water surface. The film consists
> of a 2-D hexagonal pattern of silver nanocrystals (only nm size)
> with each nanocrystal's surface capped by compressible organic
> molecules.  Applying pressure to the film can decrease the distance
> between adjacent nanocrystals from 12 to 5 angstroms.  When
> compressed, the film becomes shiny and its optical properties match
> those of a thin metal film.  Prior to compression, the film has the
> optical properties of an insulator: in this state, the
> nanocrystalsbehave as semi-isolated particles and they do not share
> electrons.  As the separation between nanocrystals decreases, the
> researchers observe a transition from "classical coupling" (adjacent
> nanocrystals induce the movement of charge in each other and
> thereby transfer energy) to "quantum coupling" (nanocrystals begin
> to share electrons simultaneously and electrons delocalize, or cease
> to occupy a specific position in the material). (C. P. Collier et al,
> Science, 26 September 1997)
