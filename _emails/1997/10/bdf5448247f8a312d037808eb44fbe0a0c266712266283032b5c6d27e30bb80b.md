Excellent! So have NAMBLA move their HQ to New Mexico. Then they can talk
about fucking little boys' brains out to their heart's content, in person
or on their Web site, without breaking any local laws.

Welcome to the Fifty Fiefdoms. Of course, there'll be changes in the next revision of the Constitution:

  1) The First, Second, Fourth and Fifth Amendments will be missing.
  2) The Tenth Amendment will be altered so that the it says:
     "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
     nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
     respectively, or to the people -- unless we feel like usurping them,
     or we can convince people they don't need them by spreading FUD."
