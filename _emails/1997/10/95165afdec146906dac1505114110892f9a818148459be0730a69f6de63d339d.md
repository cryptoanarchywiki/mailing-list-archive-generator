Not just this, but doctors and nurses are under strong laws which forbid
them from keeping certain kinds of patient information private. For example:

* under Tarasoff, counsellors and shrinks must "narc out" their patients
who are discussing their fantasies, dreams, past actions, future plans, etc.

* gunshot and similar wounds may not be treated in privacy....doctors and
nurses face prison time if they don't narc out such patients

(One of the books I almost bought at the Gun Show was a controversial and
gory book, "Ditch Medicine," intended for treatment of gunshot wounds,
emergency amputations, etc., when doctors are not around, as in a battle or
in the wilderness, or where a "bootleg doctor" cannot be obtained. No doubt
the American Medical Association would like to see this book banned.)

The "medical privacy" bills are guaranteed to be like other "privacy
bills": fig leaves for social planners to hold up in front of Joe Sixpack,
but with the usual backdoors.

(PGP, Inc. could increase market share by offering a special "Hospital
Records Recovery" feature. "It's for the children!!!!")

All we need to ensure medical privacy is a return to the right of contract.
I pay Dr. Jones for his services and for his agreement to not pass my
medical file around to his buddies, or to sell it to advertisers, or to let
"counter-terrorism" agents snoop around in his files. Sounds fair to me.

(And if he violates this trust, kneecap him in the parking lot....it'll
send a message to other contract-breakers.)

Right. Sure. Whatever.

Until they decide they want to.

America is emulating the Soviet "psychiatric prison" system. Look at Roby
Ridge, where some possibly eccentric old lady is being beseiged by
Waco-type raiders. Look for her to "set her house on fire."

(Not to sound like the little dog in Oz, but: "Pay no attention to the SWAT
team pushing the nozzle of a flame thrower under her door.")

As for Leahy, he's been a typical political criminal, guilty of several
capital crimes, for decades. I was never fooled.
