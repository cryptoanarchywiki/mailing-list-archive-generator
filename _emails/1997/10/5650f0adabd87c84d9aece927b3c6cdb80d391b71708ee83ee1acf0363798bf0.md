"Not required to encrypt to CMR key" but "mail will bounce which
doesn't encrypt to CMR key" seems like a fairly small distinction to
me.  So you don't have to encrypt to the CMR key, but if you don't the
message won't get there?  (Of course only when strict flag is set on
policy enforcer, and user id on key you are sending to has CMR request
tag).

Sort of like: you can dial the phone number wrongly if you want, it's
your choice (to avoid phone tap).

And yes you can bypass it, if you're technical, but most people
aren't.  And the bypass can be detected if anyone is checking.

Sounds like a simpler interim solution, if that's what CMR reportedly is?

It's close, but not quite the same.

The major distinction is that Mark wasn't proposing leaving recovery
information sticking out on email traffic going over the Internet in
the form of CMR extra recipients.  (Also Mark wasn't proposing
bouncing mail which didn't meet requirements)

I you have a policy enforcer set to allow all mails through (no strict
setting), then what Mark described does sound similar at first glance,
but there is actually a very significant difference: there is no
message recovery concept: just emails are encrypted to who they're
meant to be sent to.  (In one case the individual, in the other case
the department).

The outer encryption layer I don't think actually adds anything in
this case (other than potentially extra security if the individual's
passphrase is poor).


Given that, couldn't the same be achieved with 0 modifications?  Have
different keys, some shared, some not.

sales@acme.com
fred@acme.com
jane@acme.com

with sales@acme.com key shared between sales manager and sales
persons?
