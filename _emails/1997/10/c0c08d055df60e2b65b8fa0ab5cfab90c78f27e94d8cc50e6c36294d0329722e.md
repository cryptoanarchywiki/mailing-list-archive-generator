As a user of OpenBSD, and having tried to manage projects with it for
implementation of added features for customers...I could not agree with
the above position.

You see, if you are ALREADY familiar with OpenBSD then you will most likely
know exactly what to do when installing and seting up a system. New User's
Notes / Installation Checklist's will most likely be ignored by you.

However, if you are brand new to the system, then an Installation / Setup
Checklist (a good one) will prove to be essential. Wouldn't it be great if
just about every post to these groups from a new user was one like "..hey!
This OpenBSD thingy works great! The installation was a snap!.." or something
like that.  We all know that hardly happens now...but, it could.....

I, for one, believe strongly that a good 'Overview', 'Setup Notes' and 'Installation
Checklist' must somehow find it's way into the distribution. It is also clear
that the machine / arch specific differences will require unique versions
for each.
