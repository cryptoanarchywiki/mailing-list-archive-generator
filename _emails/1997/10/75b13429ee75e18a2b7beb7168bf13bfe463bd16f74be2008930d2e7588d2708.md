The year before the Supreme Court mandated the Exclusionary Rule back
in the 60s (go ask Mike Godwin for specifics :-), the New York City
Police Department didn't bother getting any search warrants.
They just searched, and if they found something, they used it.
The year _after_ the Exclusionary Rule, they got warrants.

Obviously the Feds don't keep statistics of illegal wiretaps,
just legal ones.  And they certainly don't keep stats of cellphone
conversations local police pick up with scanners.

				Thanks!
