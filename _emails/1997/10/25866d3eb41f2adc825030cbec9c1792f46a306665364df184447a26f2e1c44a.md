Sending a copy to the boss of everything Alice sends is OK.

If Alice wants to send something her boss should not read, perhaps she
should use her private account, rather than a company paid account.

Sending a copy of everything Alice receives to the boss or HR is not OK.

Alice should get to control it.

It would be acceptable for the company system to keep track of what
Alice has received, and flag "Alice received something, and has not
yet filed the cleartext copy with us"

It is not acceptable to just plain snoop on what Alice receives.

Alice needs finer granuality of control.  The leakage to her boss primarily
affects her, rather than the sender.

Furthermore any auto-snoop feature sets a very dangerous precedent.

It is politically a lot more difficult for the FBI to mandate that they
can recover your data, if such a mandate leads to the message flashing up, 
"now sending a copy to the FBI" every time you decrypt something.
