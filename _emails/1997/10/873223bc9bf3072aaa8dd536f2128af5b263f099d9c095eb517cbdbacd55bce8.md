PGP has stated that their corporate user requirement is recovery of
stored data.  This can be easily be acheived by escrowing storage
keys, or other stored data recovery methods.  That includes sent and
received email archives.

CMR seems more functionally suited to wire-tapping or corporate
snooping.  PGP denies that this is a design decision.  PGP states that
they want to make a system which is hard for governments to abuse as
the basis of mandatory GAK.

If we accept those denials, the CMR design does not meet it's design
well.  It sends recovery information with the communication, which is
both a bad security practice, and easy for government to abuse.

Please read:

	http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/cdr/

for an example of a storage key recovery design for data recovery
which is more resilient to government abuse.

That study was talking about the design problems in centralised key
escrow.  PGP Inc's design means that these design problems are
bypassed; the CMR design (if/when it gets abused by government to
become a "GMR" design) means that the NSA can publish a GMR master key
on their web page today, and that Clinton can pass the presidential
decree tomorrow.

Some have argued, that you _could_ build a similar system with pgp2.x
using it's multiple recipients feature.  I agree, you could.

However that is no excuse to go and build such a system!  It is much
less dangerous to build CDR systems; much less dangerous to build systems
which are able to recover only data stored on disk.

All that they want is possible with pgp5.5, or will be with pgp6.0,
and backwards compatibility is already in place in 5.5 (and perhaps
5.0, tho' this compatibility seems to be hard to get anyone to clarify).

Another claim is that the CMR system is easy to by pass, and therefore
it is privacy friendly.

I'm not sure this argument amounts to much, because clipper was also
easy to by pass.  Unless you're using steganography, the government
could detect the bypass, and then the GAK system becomes just another
one of those laws that the die-hards break, but which can translate
into 10 years jail time if you get caught, or if the government
decides you need knocking down a peg or two.

I would have thought if any one understood this, it would have been
Phil Zimmermann, after his Federal investigation.

Really, if you are familiar with the clipper design, PGP Inc's CMR is a very
related design, it is almost exactly clipper implemented in software.

The design allows for multiple "message recovery" keys, or it allows for one
single centralised one (belonging to the NSA, if the NSA has their way).

The Blaze et al report you are quoting just says that having a single
central recovery key is an incredible security risk.  It also says that
managing many frequently changing recovery keys centrally is also complex.

The NSA still seemed to think it worth the risk with the clipper design,
because they figured they could keep the key recovery database locked up
well enough to prevent another Ames selling it to the Russians, or whoever.

PGP 5.5 is clipper written in software.  Yes it can be bypassed, yes the
software has privacy options which make the recovery option optional; it
also has installation options to make it non-optional; by passing the
non-optional version can be detected by a corporate or government snoop.

Corporate snoops are yucky but they are much less ominous than government
snoops.
