Let's not forget that cops are often the bad guys.

And I don't mean this in a macho, off-the-pigs way. I mean that throughout
history the "cops" are those who have enforced the laws and whims of
tyrants, who have arrested and tortured and executed dissidents and
nonconformists of all flavors, and who were the "King's men" in the times
of the Founders.

Even in more recent decades in the U.S., don't forget it was "cops" who
harassed civil rights workers, who broke up perfectly legal strikes, who
arrested and imprisoned Eugene Debs for speaking out against the draft in
particular and a foolish war, WW 1, in general, and so on. One need only
look to J. Edgar Hoover and his police state measures.

(In fact, the very term "police state" tells us all we need to know about
whether or not "Mr. Policeman is Your Friend" is always, or even most of
the time, true.)

And with full awareness that I am invoking Godwin's Law, the "cops" in
Europe in the 1933-45 period were the enforcers of Hitler's policies.

Here's a list of some folks throughout history and in various regimes who
would likely have reason not to want to escrow their keys with the local
police:

poets, authors, Scharansky, Solzhenitsyn, refuseniks, Chinese dissidents,

Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael, civil rights workers, Margaret Sanger, birth
control activists, abortionists, anti-abortionists, Michael Milken, Robert
Vesco, Marc Rich, Nixon's Enemies, Hoover's enemies, Clinton's enemies,
Republicans, Democrate, anarchists, labor organizers, pornographers,
readers of "Playboy," viewers of images of women whose faces are uncovered,
Amateur Action, Jock Sturges, violators of the CDA, alt.fan.karla-homulka
readers,  Internet Casino customers, Scientologists, Rosicrucians,
