I've been thinking about building remailers and cover-traffic generators,
and there's a need for a convenient up-to-date list of remailers.
Raph Levien's remailer pinging service is definitely convenient,
and even produces some of its output in perl for use by perl programs.
However, it's important to be really careful when depending on information 
like this, e.g. when building it into programs, because otherwise it's
easy to trick them into using bogus data, such as the crudely forged
article sent to Cypherpunks earlier today.  The natural implementation is
to pick the more reliable remailers based on "Raph"'s statistics,
so adding records for very reliable bogus remailers is a win.

The security would be improved if Raph signed the weekly file,
but that also requires people using the file to check it with PGP
and not just grep out the relevant lines for their programs' use.
