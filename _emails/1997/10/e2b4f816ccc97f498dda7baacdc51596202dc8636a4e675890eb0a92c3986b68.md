    do you believe this?  so what happened to our privacy?
    the man screams about privacy and encryption one minute, 
    then:

        Jesse Berst, ZDNet AnchorDesk, full story at 
        http://www.zdnet.com/anchordesk/story/story_1324.html

    really?

    just what I wanted, a fucking background check. 

    nice schill, Jesse.  OK, I'll call my broker and buy 
    Verisign stock.  they're going to be worth bocu bucks
    taking over the fascists' National ID project.

    gee, that's clever.  but The NYTimes, The Times 
    [London], the Telegraph, and so on, already log me in
    immediately with a cookie I authorized. why do I need
    certified identity?

    even Wired mag knows me as Attila T. Hun.  interNIC
    knows me as Attila T. Hun, I even get mail to my drop
    box as Attila T. Hun....  My check writer can even 
    print checks as Attila T. Hun (the bank does not care
    what the name on the check is --just the MICR numbers).

> ...Your bank knows for sure that it's really you...

    sure, after I enter my password... so what's the big
    deal?  that's all I do now.  automated, too.

    OK, but I still must ID my system with my National-ID 
    card available from the cookie wash. I dont see any 
    place to turn it off! 

    bastards! --they've implanted it under my skin.

    why?  so big government or big business can really 
    catalogue my political views by the stories I read? 

    maybe it's my anti-authoritarian, psychotic behaviour 
    and rants against fascist oligarchies, 

    or, maybe because I post to Cypherpunks?
    
> ...you'll help the Internet make an important transition 
> --from a fun place to surf to a safe place to do business.

    aah haa!  I knew there was a reason for all this hoopla!
    What's good for Bill Gate$ is good for the country.

    ...uuh, sorry Mr. AL (GM) $loan; I meant to quote you
    correctly: "What's good for General Motors is good for
    the country."

> A safer Internet is at hand. All you have to do is seize it.
    

    no, jesse, you got that one wrong --the coy fascist dog
    F[reeh,uck] just seized you --and the rest of the
    suckers that fall for Verisign's National-ID.

        attila still going out...
