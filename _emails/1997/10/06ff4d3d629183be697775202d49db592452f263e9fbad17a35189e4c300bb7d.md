I saw on the news today that the Canadian Federal Bank (whatever it is
called) decided to raise interests rates recently, because they were
afraid that the economy was becoming "too robust."

Would anyone like to bet that this little tidbit of information is not
likely to help those who Unemployment Insurance Commission workers call
deadbeats because they can't find a job?
