We need to compile a list of people that law-abiding citizens can send
copies of their secret keys.
I will start the list with those that the LAC has already mentioned.
Surely other C'punks will have their own nominees for this position
of supreme trust.

1. The FBI guy who shot Randy Weaver's wife.
2. The FBI guy, Kahoe, who ordered evidence of the FBI murder of
   citizens destroyed.
3. One of the other four top FBI officials who helped with the
   cover-up?
4. Your drug drug dealer, to pass along to his CIA connection.
5. A Jewish person, to give to the Mossad, to pass on to the CIA.
6. The NYC cop with the toilet plunger in his hand.
