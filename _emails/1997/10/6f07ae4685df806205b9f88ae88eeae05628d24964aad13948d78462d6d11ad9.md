 " If passed, the traditional hamfest flea markets where all sorts
of bizzare old radio junk gets traded for cash or swapped for other
gear will be largely a thing of the past, as almost all radio receivers
and transcievers that hams and other electronic hackers might want to
sell or trade will be seriously illegal, and one never knows who that
anonymous cash customer really is..."

The odds are very good that as technology increases the power & freedom of individuals to make an end run around the state that the state will increasingly make the effort to stop it.
This could get really ugly in the future.  Indeed, it has already, but most are not awake enough to notice. Devolution or the demise of the central power is a dangerous process to be caught up in.
In the case of the fedgov, it has a lot of power to abuse and I expect that the latest encryption fight is just a warmup. If the crooks & criminals in the intelligensia can't get their way legally,
then their only option is "any means possible." That covers a lot of territory.

Insure youself against the state. The King likes it *his* way.
