I don't suppose you are arguing that having multiple small points of 
failure makes GAK acceptable...

The 'single point of failure' mode is such obviously bad design that
NSA will never go for it -- they aren't dumb.  Consider that if you
have a single master key for all escrowed things (for example): that
single master key will have to be used for *every* wiretap, every FOI
act action, etc.  It will be in constant daily use by many people, 
and keeping it secure will be, practically speaking, impossible.
