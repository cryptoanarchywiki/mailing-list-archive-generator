Hi,

Since we apparently now have at least one commercial anonymous remailer I
would be interested in the gross cash flow. In short, I would like to know
the general difference (plus/minus and by about how much) between the cost
of the remailer operation versus the actual e-cash income in American dollars
each month. It would also be nice to know the relative ratio between free 
and for-pay submissions. Is the remailer to be advertised, and if so where?

Would it be possible to have such info say submitted to the list for the
next few months?

I want to put one up now that we are moving to a T1 within the next few
weeks but I have to justify it financialy.
