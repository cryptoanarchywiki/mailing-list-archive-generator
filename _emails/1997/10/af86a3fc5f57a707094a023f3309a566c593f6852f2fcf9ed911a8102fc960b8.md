Oooh.  PGP Inc damage control mode on <clunk>!

We all would like to hear the reason too, Jon :-)

Here are a couple of reasonably plausible ones:

- common source tree with #ifdefs for different products

- some functionality required even in non business version to inform
  user about policy flag meanings

btw I didn't read the source code quoted so that second attempt at a
plausible reason might be a dud.

btw2: it isn't just Bruce that doesn't like key escrow.
btw3: your definition of "data recovery" is wrong.
