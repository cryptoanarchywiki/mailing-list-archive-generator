Hi! I just loved +The Plot, Thickening;, it4s great!
I4m from Portugal and I4m very concerned about these kind of problems
nowadays.
I think we4re coming to state of apocalyptic brainstorm, I think it4s
also simtomatic. 
Please send news because I became curious about cyberstuff.
Email me to adrimacedo@rocketmail.com
