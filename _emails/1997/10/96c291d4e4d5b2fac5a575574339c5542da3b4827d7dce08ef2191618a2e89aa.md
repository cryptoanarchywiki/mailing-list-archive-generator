STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION - Foreign Terrorist List
============================================================
Publication of List of Foreign Terrorist Organizations - Public 
Announcement
 October 8, 1997

 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
 Office of the Spokesman

The Secretary of State has designated as foreign terrorist 
organizations thirty organizations that engage in terrorist activity 
that threatens the security of United States nationals or the 
national security of the United States, pursuant to the 
Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 
104-132).  Designation as a foreign terrorist organization carries 
legal consequences for persons who aid these organizations, for the 
organizations funds, and for representatives and members who seek 
to enter the United States.  The list of foreign terrorist 
organizations was published in the Federal Register on October 8, 
1997.

The Department of State has no specific information regarding 
threats to U.S. citizens at this time as a result of the designation 
of foreign terrorist organizations, but believes some of the groups 
may consider changing their attitude toward targeting U.S. interests 
in reaction to their designation.  American citizens traveling 
abroad should always seek to minimize their risks by being aware of 
their surroundings and exercising caution as to their activities.  
U.S. citizens planning to travel abroad should consult the 
Department of State's country-specific Travel Warnings, Consular 
Information Sheets, and regional travel brochures.

This Public Announcement expires on January 8, 1998.
