That really does seem easier than all this checksum business;
if you're exchanging secrets anyway you could also type your
half-keys into some friendly application program, but this is fun.
On the other hand, for Alice's Fax Machine calling Bob's Fax Machine,
it's tougher to automate this stuff.  Does the phone have some way
to output the checksums to a data port for checking later?
(stuffing it into the fax header field would be a nice touch.)

If there's a failure, you're going to burn this list anyway;
if Alice and Bob each read all their codewords, Mallory can trick them
about 1/16**6 times (1/16Million), which is pretty low -
Mallory learns up to six codewords, but they're only useful if
he doesn't get caught or if Alice and Bob decide to reuse the list
because they don't have a chance to exchange more email.
So if you're not worried about denial of service, catch him.
You do have to make sure Alice and Bob _notice_ they've been hosed;
you can get a bit fancier by using two lists, one for use 
in case of errors or other interruptions
Alice: Swordsman Swordsman Marxist  ->
Mallory: Marxist COUGH COUGH ->
		<- Bob: Dilbert Marxist Aardvark, and repeat please
		<- Mallory: Swordsman Dilbert COUGH, and repeat please
Alice: Swordsman Swordsman Marxist, sounds like you have a cold? ->
Mallory: Marxist Dilbert Aardvark, and I've got a cold too. ->

As opposed to 
		<- Bob: Bogus Suspicious Fnord, and repeat please
Alice: Swordsman Swordsman Marxist, and I've got a bad feeling about this....		

Even just using one list for Alice and one for Bob helps this attack.
