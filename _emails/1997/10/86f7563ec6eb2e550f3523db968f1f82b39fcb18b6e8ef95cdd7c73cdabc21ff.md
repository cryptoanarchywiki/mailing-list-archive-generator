The same organizations who seek to banish the
Suicide Doctor Kevorkian are probably up in arms
over this announcement.

"This should be illegal!"

"Keep him alive!"

Suicide is illegal in most "democracies" for one
reason - so that the State can confiscate the
material goods of the deceased.
