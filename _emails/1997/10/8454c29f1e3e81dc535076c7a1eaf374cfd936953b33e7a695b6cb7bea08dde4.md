   None of these targets shoots back ... none of these targets pump up
much adrenaline. I would never call myself a great shot (I did qualify
expert at both rifle, M-14, "A" course and pistol, .45, 1911A1), and I
can tell you of making several 25-35 yard snap shots in the jungle at
moving shooting targets with the adrenaline driving my eyeballs
through the roof ... but they were exactly that, pure reflex, center
of body mass shots, under max pressure. I must in all fairness recall
the other three to six shots each time that could have gone anywhere
and probably did.

  The point is, "shooting to wound" is a dangerous delusion! *no one*
can predict what a bullet will do when it enters the body. The rule I
have always followed is don't take out your gun unless you are going
to use it; don't use it unless you intend to kill. Makes decisions
much easier on that basis.
