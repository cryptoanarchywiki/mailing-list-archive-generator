You have this wrong.  In fact, NSA *supplies* keys for classified
encryption equipment.  They never told me whether they "escrowed"
copies of the keys they supply -- what do you think?

In fact, it's much more complex.  People with real classified data
don't trust encryption at all, and they only use it if they absolutely
have to.  They, unlike many cypherpunks, remember well that there are
other ways to get information besides running big computers, and if
you have protections against those in place already, crypto doesn't
buy much. 

But classified data isn't really interesting.  Though by any measure
there are huge amounts of it, it is dwarfed by the amount of
government data that is not classified.  To protect that data
government agencies will use comercial crypto, and "key recovery"
*will* be required in any commercial product purchased by a government
agency.  As use of crypto becomes commonplace business practice, the
government market will be huge, and consequently, commercial products
with key recovery *will* be prevelant.  Any company that doesn't 
supply it will be relegated to niche markets, and, if legal winds 
blow the wrong way, eliminated.
