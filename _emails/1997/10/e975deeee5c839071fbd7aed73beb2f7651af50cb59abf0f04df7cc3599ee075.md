Can you better define the term 'basis'?

I can see the union 'build complicated things out of basic building blocks'
and the use of Occam's Razor (I'm as lazy as any other programmer) but fail
to see how this maps to anything relating to the concept of orthogonal.
Which clearly doesn't have any inherent minimalist cast.
