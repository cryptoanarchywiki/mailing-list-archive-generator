True, but most assemblers would let you insert static data into the object
file using various pseudo-ops like that.

Oh, those were fun to debug too...

Actually that took three cycles.  One to fetch the opcode, one to fetch the
target address, and one to fetch the data byte.  If you wanted to do it in
two cycles, you had to write the data into the operand of the instruction
that loaded it (self-modifying code).
