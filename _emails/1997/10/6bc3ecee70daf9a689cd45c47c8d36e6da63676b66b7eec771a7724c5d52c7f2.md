Read "The Millionaire Next Door" for tips on what millionaires (who are of
course the "barely non-poor" these days) are likely to be wearing and
flaunting. Turns out that most Yuppies driving BMWs and wearning Rolexes
are doing so on _credit_. Driving a Mercedes or BMW has nothing to do with
actual ability to pay bills.

I can't speak for what Gates does, but the 3rd or 4th richest man, Gordon
Moore of Intel, was signed up for the company plan. As a fail-safe,
emergency room plan, it's a winner. If grossly more expensive treatments
are needed, more than the health care plan will pay for, he can always opt
for this.

(The "savings" by self-insuring are trivial, even to average folks. Given
that a company health plan will not _stop_ patients from paying more, the
company plan is valuable insurance against being turned away as an
indigent.)
