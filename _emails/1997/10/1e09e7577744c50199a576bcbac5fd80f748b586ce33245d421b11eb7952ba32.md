Not sure where I stand on this. An OS is more like a highway than a car.
Or, better, a rail track -- since it imposes severe compatibility
requirements on those who want to utilize it.

Imagine that someone owned the rail track standard & had the exclusive
IP-rights to manufacture it. Non-standard tracks exist, but they don't go
nearly as many places. Then the company uses its position as owner of the
tracks to demand...

Oh screw it. I don't feel like going down analogy road any further. Detail
is the enemy of ideology, & the significant detail re: Microsoft is the
rare & happy (for Bill Gates) character of its business that it is more
important to have a standard OS than to have a quality OS. Therein lies his
billions, & it seems to me reasonable to scrutinize attempts to parlay that
counter-ordinary-market reality into dominance in other areas. Perhaps this
could be settled as the online service spat was: bundle Netscape with Win98
(& Opera, Arachne &c).

Or perhaps the US could nationalize Windows. Whoo-hoo! Therein lies a Plan...
