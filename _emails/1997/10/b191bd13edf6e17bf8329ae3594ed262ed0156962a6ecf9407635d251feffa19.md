Duh. Look you picked the numbers and the scenarios, if you got a bitch about

Acceptable.

So how do we rollback the payments if say the nth hop breaks the delivery?
If I were a user and one of the remailers dropped the traffic I would want
all my money back, I'm paying for delivery to a specific party.

It is clear that the n-1 remailers has no claim to the charges since the
email was not delivered to the recipient. Yet, it is not fair to take their
income simply because some other remailer dropped mail due to a policy
problem, which they clearly didn't have since they delivered the traffic to the
next hop successfuly. Perhaps the remailer with the restrictive hop should
pay the n-1 remailers. This would certainly provide clear financial
incentive for remailers to have liberal fair use policies (which I support
fully) and act as true commen-carries simply doing a job mechanicaly like
the phone system or the network infrastructure itself. The bottem line is
that if commercial anonymous remailers will survive they have to be as
liberal with handling traffic as my routed is.

Is it? If this were commercial systems the key server would NOT be on any
remailers involved otherwise we have a prime target for man-in-the-middle
attacks. So, assuming the user gets the key and the remailers get the keys
from a 3rd party server which delivers the incorrect keys for whatever
reason. Who pays for the failure then? To me it looks like the key server,
but they aren't involved in traffic control but key control. While it is
clearly fair to charge them for costs (say 1 remailer hop) incurred due to
bad keys (which could be the original submitters fault), who pays the other
remailers who handle the traffic and loose the income through no fault of
their own?

Also, what happens if the key is good but the software glitches (which is
indistinguishable from a bad key at the source level)? Are you proposing
we re-send for free all along the chain? I don't think the remailers which
succeded will take kindly to that.

If the MTBF for a remailer is n then the MTBF for m remailers is n*m. In
other words the remailer chain gets less reliable as it gets longer.

Let me say it again, traffic analysis doesn't look at the contents,
cryptanalysis does. Whether the contents are encrypted or not is irrelevant.
The word 'encrypted' NEVER occurs in traffic analysis. You encrypt the
contents because it is assumed that the network analysis has already
succeeded.

Ok, so the recipient has no way to reply to specific parties unless the
contents contain the source address in a source encrypted block. In such a
case Mallet is going to look at the recipient and begin traffic analysis on
them. Which Mallet is going to do as soon as they either submit or recieve
traffic from that node anyway. Seems moot. An effective Mallet collects
statistics on all participants indiscrimenantly.

This is another example of the apparently unrecognized and implicit
assumption that Mallet is only going to look at one party in the chain.
Bad assumption. Traffic analysis will succeed ONLY if the *network* is
analyzed, not some specific node in that network.

This sounds like a message pool where a recipient must attempt decode on
every packet they recieve. The ones not meant for them fail. I don't believe
this is a commercialy viable process because of the amount of work on the
recipients machine.

I have a further question. The cover traffic that shows up in the recipients
mailbox unrequested is spam isn't it? Also, when the recipient uncovers the
last block is it going to say "This space intentionaly left blank"? Or can
users of your remailer expect to recieve email full of hex gibberish they
can't decode since they don't have a key? My suspicion is that if you are
sending cover traffic to anything other than a /dev/null recipient
with an a priori agreement you are not going to keep your users long.

Turn those numbers around and you might manage to cover the traffic.
The cover traffic MUST be greater than the 'real' traffic to be effective.
My suspicion based on about 4 months of playing with MixMaster 1.5 years ago
is that this ratio must be several orders of magnitude unless your traffic
is measured in the millions+ of transactions per day.

All the outgoing traffic better look the 'same' it's nothing but a standard
TCP/IP routing header and the contents (which we never look at). The
remailer software is irrelevant on this issue. Traffic analysis relies on
the stability of the protocols and their source & destination info not what
they are used for.

As for the rest of it, take the equation I gave in a previous email and feed
it into a spreadsheet. Develop the equations that define the network using
the same sort of structures and proceedures you use for a travelling
salesman problem (check a local library). If you're asking me to do that
work then I need money, I'll talk about work for free - I don't do work
for free.

The remailer only needs records of transactions while a transaction remains
un-committed. The only long term record it should keep is the number of
transactions processed and how much money is currently on the books.

The records are not available unless somebody cracks the box and begins to
tool around the OS ... Mallet is pretty sneaky he reads CERT and collects
hacker software too. If your remailer is keeping records of transactions
after the transactions close you are not secure. You are actualy providing
further incentive to Mallet.

Just exactly where is anonymity mentioned in the 1st? And since it clearly
is not how do you extend:

 
				ARTICLE I. 
 
	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, 
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of 
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, 
and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. 

 

Is your claim that the remailer is a press? (I rhetoricaly bet not) If so
then every computer irrespective of use is a press and protected. Are you
going to follow this line in future cases?

Or is your argument that the traffic is speech and therefore the carrier of
the traffic is immune to prosecution? If so you may have some problems in
the future when the judges and prosecutors get a better clue. Because the
1st's speech clause protects the source of speech not the carrier - that's why
the founding fathers specificaly mention freedom of the press - to extend
that protection to the carrier. Or did you use the commen-carrier approach?

My money is that you used the second line of reasoning which means you can
expect it to be over-turned in the coming years. Unless somebody manages to
get a court to recognize computers as presses and extend those protections
fully or networked computers (not the applications they are put to) in
general as commen-carrier the battle isn't over.

Now if you throw the 9th and 10th in there (which I further rhetoricaly bet
you didn't) you got a winning combo.

Rhetorical question: do you realize that all networked computers are
                     remailers at the routed level? Did you extend your
                     argument thusly?
