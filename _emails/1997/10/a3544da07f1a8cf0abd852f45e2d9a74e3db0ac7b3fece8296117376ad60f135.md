I have talked to people in government and the offshore private sector here
and think Anguilla has a very good chance of passing a law making digital
signatures legally recognized, at least for corporations.  I think we
would be the first taxhaven to do so.  Currently companies use corporate
seals. 

I mentioned that there were a few other jurisdictions that had passed some
laws like this and they would like me to try to pin down which and, if
possible, get copies of the laws. 

I remember some talk about this on cypherpunks, so I am hoping someone
here can tell me which places (think there was some state) have such laws,
and if possible tell me where I can get a copy.

Thanks,
