Of course, this comes as no surprise to those who follow the 'Chronicles
of InfoWar,' since we have long been aware that the secret government 
long ago declared 'information' to be 'munitions.'
How long until we hear the official announcement that *all* information
will need to be 'registered,' in the interests of National Security, and
to protect the citizens from the 2,000,000 Horses of the Apocalypse?
(Including, no doubt, terroists with 'suitcases' full of 'information.')

  Is this supposed to come as a 'surprise'?

  His experience and track-record also make him a perfect choice for
revitalizing the FBI's ability to cover up their mistakes, keeping
their dirty little secrets out of the hands of the public.

  Whitehust, who will die in a tragic car-accident later this year,
will soon be exposed as a drug-addicted, godless-commie pedophile.
