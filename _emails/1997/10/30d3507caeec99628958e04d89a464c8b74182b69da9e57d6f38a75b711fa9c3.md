A point that I still feel gets lost by some participants in this issue
is that the changes to PGP for CMR/GMR are very minor -- all that needs
to occur is to get the CMR keys from wherever they are stored, and then
add them as additional recipients.  The political value of persuading
PGP to adopt CDR >> actual technical value, as the change to CMR should
involve < 10 lines of code (said, of course, without actually inspecting
the code :).
