I know quite few people in that sort of situation.

I must disagree there. She has the qualifications to obtain employment in
may corporations and such. As a matter of fact, unless she happens to be
inequivicaly wedded to live in her current abode have her send me her
resume. I will be quite happy to submit it to the H/R department at Tivoli
(an IBM company I admit) for a position in our training department (last
time I checked they had like 90 positions they wanted to fill globaly). I
can guarantee the cost of living is somewhat lower than NY here in Texas
and her pay will most likely be higher than current. There is also the
opportunity for global travel if she is interested and were to get hired.

Sending out resumes is cheap, about $.40 a company.

Obviously this is open to alternate interpretation depending upon to what
lengths the party is willing to go to change their life. Skills are what you
sell not a particular job title or duty set.

Complacency and despondancy can be opportunity killers.

            Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the

            forms of kings to govern him?  Let history answer this
            question.
