Don't any of you get any ideas here, but in California it is ridiculously
easy to get someone committed for a 72-hour observation period. All one has
to do is convince one of the various agencies that a person is a possible
danger to himself or to others.

So, 72 hours playing head games with a shrink doesn't sound so bad, does it?

For starters, expect a regimen of antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs,
sort of a reduced version of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." Then,
expect shrinks who are looking for antisocial behavior, not organic
psychoses.

Worst of all, the mere fact of having been committed, regardless of the
eventual outcome, can mean a complete loss of rights to own a handgun,
rifle, or shotgun for a long period (10 years, I think). Failure to let the
Thought Police in for a look around one's home is almost ipso facto grounds
for committment.

"I'm having fantasies, doctor, about spraying a vanload of shrinks
trespassing on my property."

Enough to get me committed? Go ahead, make my day.
