You may be right for all others, and you may be kidding, but in the 
case (!) of world-beloved  Michael Froomkin, he's the sweetest, 
kindest, most caring, funniest lawyer professor qua human on the 
orb, in the dying galaxy, ever. 

Visit his web page for irrefutable confirmation that he is the real 
thing in earthbound angels of legal humor.

Best of all, he has no e-mail address.
