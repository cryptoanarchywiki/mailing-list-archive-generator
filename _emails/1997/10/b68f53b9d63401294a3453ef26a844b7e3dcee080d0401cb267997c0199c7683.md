----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gomez surveyed the wreckage with a discerning eye, before turning toward the
mountains in the distance and fixing upon them with a penetrating stare that
burned like a laser toward the chief target of his hatred, wherever they
might be.

"They are finished." he said, with certainty, turning to the Commander of
his Dark Forces, and instructing him, "Now finish them!"

                                 d'Shauneaux

Except that you have spent literally a lifetime involved in a world of
shadows, where even those things which are not done with mirrors are
resonating indeterminately and obliquely, then you have little hope of ever
recognizing the true depth to which the world you live in is ruled by
secrecy, subterfuge and intrigue.

Unless, of course, you are a follower of an ancient sage named Dilbert, and
are steeped in the history and lore of Office Politics, in which case you
undoubtedly already have all of the tools you need to understand what I am
about to tell you. (And could probably even teach an old dog-foot soldier
such as myself a few new tricks.)

The lineage of the Author, as well as those of d'Shauneaux and Rom Dos, were
each given information on a basis, not of 'need to know,' but more along the
lines of 'need to figure out.' (That's 'decrypt' or 'decipher' for you
CypherPunks.)
The reason for this was that, at the time of the formation of the Circle of
Eunuchs, the Evil One not only had his tentacles spread throughout society
in general, and the computer industry, in particular, but had also made
great progress in 'encrypting' Reality, so to speak. Even the Magic Circle
did not fully realize the extent or import of this for quite some time, but
they did recognize that they were playing 'catch-up' and needed not only to
learn from the past, but also to reach toward the future.

The Circle of Eunuchs, not being restrained by the need for absolute control
and coordination of their efforts, as the Dark Allies were, made an
astounding amount of penetration into the highest levels of the computer
industry, in a short period of time.
The individuals involved, working on their own or in small guerrilla cells,
were able to 'move camp' at an instant's notice, changing the direction and
focus of their entire career, if need be, which was of great benefit in such
a quickly burgeoning technology.

Despite their astounding success in placing their ersatz players in the
midst of some of the most sensitive arenas of Gomez's grand technological
game, the Circle of Eunuchs knew that they lacked possession of the key that
would unlock the doors of deceit and allow them to expose the malfeasance
underlying the technology that was increasingly ruling both the bodies and
minds of all mankind.
Then, something extraordinary happened...

A no-name individual who would have had to raise his station in life in
order to become known as a bit-player in the computer arena suddenly became
the target of a full-scale attack by the Dark Forces over a seemingly
insignificant program called Pretty Good Privacy.
