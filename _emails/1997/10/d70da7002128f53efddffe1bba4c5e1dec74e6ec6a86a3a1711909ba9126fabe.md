Shure they do because one of the things I would love to do is run a
commercial anon remailer. If I as a businessman motivated to get into it can't
justify it how in the world can somebody with less technical experience
justify it? How would you justify it to your bank for a $10k loan? I suspect
that if I can find a way to overcome my anal retentive penny pinching then
it will sell others as well.

You obviously have never done business with me. I've turned more than
one customer away because they were either stupid or wanted something that
was completely out of line. I provide my customers a specific set of
services at specific fees with specific results, period. If they don't like
the way their baby looks that is their problem, I just deliver 'em. I do
this out of love, not a need to feed.

Depends on their motivation...a question we all seem to be grappling with.
If it's possible I am shure that one of the thousands of posts that we
generate on this issue will be the trigger.
