Well, nobody is purporting to decide for anybody, as I understand
the case, what is an "operating system" in general. DOJ only 
seeks to enforce what MS agreed to, in the Decree. If those two
parties chose to define OS for that pupose, and only for that
purpose, as blanketyblank, why do we care? Because that's all
their litigation is about.
