No, there has been little technical discussion.  Maybe I've missed 
it, but I haven't seen from Adam a succint writeup of what his design 
actually is -- most of what he writes is so inflated with steaming 
anti-GAK rhetoric that it's hard to get a coherent picture.  Perhaps 
he will take your example to heart, and post a strawman design, and 
leave the politics to other messages.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems to imply that the CMR fields 
in the key structure are really just a convenience -- if PGP, Inc. 
didn't write an smtp filter that enforced a CMR key, someone else
(say a firewall vendor) could do so easily, defining whatever 
relationship between keys they wanted.

To make that a bit stronger, it seems like *any* model that uses 
persistent encryption keys essentially enables CMR-like functionality 
in a smtp filter -- it could be done using pgp 2.6.

And therefore, PGP Inc might as well get the business, because if 
there is demand, someone will.

In the meantime they can work on perfect forward secrecy.

Things aren't that simple.

In any case, in large organizations (corporate or government) one of
the biggest motivations for snooping is prevention of management
embarassment.  It's seriously embarassing, for example, to read in the
paper in the morning that one of your employees has been maintaining a
public ftp porn archive on the company computers....you can fire the
employee, but the damage has been done.  

It's a cold fact that some employees are stupid, and others are bad. 
Snooping is more a result of this fact than it is innate evil on the
part of management. Of course it is nicer to work in a trusting 
environment, but the problems go both ways.
