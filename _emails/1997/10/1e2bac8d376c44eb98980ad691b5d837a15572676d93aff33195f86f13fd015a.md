Yep.

True.  Doesn't mean I'm going to rush off and implement a policy
enforcer to do the job, nor use the good name of PGP Inc to deploy
such software widely.

> Second, it's a ridiculous idea which ignores how email works.  

Nope, it's not.  Enforcement does not have to be 100%.

People smoke various illicit substances; it's illegal: get caught with
your joint, you go to jail.

I'm on dial up, here.  I'll be going permanent just as soon as the
damn cost comes down.  ($15k for 64k line over here, you've got to be
kidding).

Most users are going via an ISP right now.

Nope.  All that is required is for the sending of non-CMR encrypted
emails to be detectable.  Super-encryption doesn't cut it -- the
government is going to notice that, after they've singled you out for
a spot check.

Lots of things are illegal which it is easy to get away with most of
the time.  Still doesn't make it a good idea to write software which
makes it easier to do spot checks, does it?

Neither of those cut it.  If your company is sampling your email, and
you've hacked around it, they'll just fire you, or what ever.

If it is the government doing the sampling, they'll just lock you up,
or tack 5 years on to the sentence for "use of non GAKed encryption in
furtherance of a crime".

Sure.  But just because this is possible doesn't mean you should do
it.  The gap between me doing it, and PGP doing it is that PGP are
shipping hundreds of thousands of the things.  Deployment wins.

Maybe.  The point is that if pgp5.5 didn't include it this extra
deployment hurdle would be the government's problem.  Users would be
using older mail systems for ages.

Nope.  Never said that.  You can remove them all you like -- your mail
just bounces when you do.

not required.

not that much of a big deal; most users have enough problems just
getting out of the box software to work without downloading cypherpunk
patches, knowing what they are etc.  Ie we _know_ that cypherpunk
types will be ok.  That's not the point.

That's an optional.

So could clipper.  Where you defeneding it too?  It was optional (or
so they said), etc.

Think about detection rather than hackign around once things become
laws with associated jail times.

I think you'll find that the majority of users will use the GAKked
stuff.  Most users are using windows.  Most are using 40 bit crypto.
