Let me describe a scenario: one key employee isn't there because... ...he is somewhere else [ :-) ]

Then, comes an urgent message forcing the company to make a split-second decision before the employee gets back.  It 
happens _all_the_time_ in small businesses where they do not have the ressource of the big companies.  You, the boss,  want to 
re-read some critical documents before making a move.  Of course, your employee was the most consciencious and trustworthy 
employee on this side of Andromeda, only, your memory fails as what was the *exact* wording of the critical documents.  It 
furthermore happens that the said faithfull employee is, unknown to you and in his mind not-company-detrimental, getting intronized 
to the mile-high club between L.A and Tokyo in the plane lavatory, therefore not reacheable by any modern means.  Wouldn't you 
wish you had his corporate private key?

In the old days, you used to scramble through his mountain of paper on his desk.  In more recent days, you frantically scanned his 
exemplary organized data structure and found the documents.  Today, the said data structure is still exceptionally orderly, but only 
to reveal several very describing filenames with a  dot-asc or dot-pgp extension.

Any comments?

I thought that this was so self-evident that I did not even thought usefull to explain.
I was not talking about having employees giving copies of their personnal private key but of their corporate private key.  The one 
they use to transact business over unsecured lines, not the one they use to send raunchy messages to their lover.

I never talked of monitoring e-mail, only of making sure the business retains access to employee-generated documents.  I used to 
have a private key for the company at a previous work location.  The first thing I did was to give my boss my passphrase for being 
afraid of what could happens if ever they needed a critical document during my absence.  He did not even know how to use PGP, 
but I made sure that somebody did.

This is why I said that a "secret" copy would be given to the boss.  He could encrypt the employees keys, print it on a micro-dot and 
hide it under his gold tooth cap.  And that way, there is always deniability since there is official company policy.  

Or better, all the boss has to do is to generate the employee's keys himself.  He could forever deny having made a copy and 
nobody could prove that he did.

Personnally, I would make sure that all keys to be used to transact business be generated by the boss, to be handed on a diskette 
in person.

As far as trying to prevent malicious action, I agree that there is no way an employer can do that.  Anybody really intent on screwing 
up things can.
