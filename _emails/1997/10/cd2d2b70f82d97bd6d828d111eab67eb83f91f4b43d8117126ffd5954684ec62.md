According to an article in today's Mercury News or SFExaminer,
Telstra has also decided that 70% of the bits on US-Australia
Internet connections are now going from Australia to the US
rather than the earlier ~100% US->Australia direction -
so it wants a major reevaluation of who pays for the
trunks connecting the Internets in the two countries
(currently Telstra pays most of the costs.)
