MISTY
Misty is a cryptographic algorithm developed by Mitsubishi Electric 
after they broke DES in 1994.It is designed to withstand linear
and differential cryptanalysis, but has not yet been cryptanalysed.
As it has not undergoneintensive peer review, 
the usual caution is recommended. It is being considered for inclusion 
into the SET 2.0 standard.
