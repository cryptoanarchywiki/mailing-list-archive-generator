First, a PGP employee announces that PGP 5.5 is available for download.
Second, I try to download it a dozen times, only to have the connection
  broken each time, after outrageously long periods of waiting for an
  extremely slow transfer.
Third, PGP 5.5 disappears from the server.
Fourth, everyone I talk to tells me their attempt to download the
  file failed.

I don't _need_ PGP 5.5. I have a beta-test version of PGP 5.0 which
serves me rudimentarily well for my purposes. I would like to check
out PGP 5.5 in order to make a proper evaluation of the features
and technology involved, but it seems that it is not available for
this purpose.
PGP will undoubtedly survive without my support, but I find it sad
that after many years of supporting PGP products, I can no longer
do so with any amount of integrity.
