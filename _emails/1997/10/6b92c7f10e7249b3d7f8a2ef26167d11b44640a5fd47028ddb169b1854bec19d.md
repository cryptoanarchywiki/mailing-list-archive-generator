This is the same group that I wrote about in June; excerpt attached below.

Note that no traditional free speech or journalist groups are represented.
Groups like ACLU, Media Coalition, EPIC, National Coalition Against
Censorship, National Campaign for Freedom of Expression, Freedom Forum,
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, PEN/NWU, Association of
American Publishers, Feminists for Free Expression, American Society of
Newspaper Editors, Media Institute, American Society of Magazine Editors,
Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression.

None of 'em there. Nada. Hell, even MPAA and the NAB would be better than
Enough is Enough.

The Cartoon Decency Act?
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)

        We all know what threats confront our children today: War.
   Hunger. Poverty. Ignorance. But animated cartoon characters on the
   Net?

        Actually, the Center for Media Education and its allies ignored
   the others and just zeroed in on the looming menace of Net-toons
   yesterday during the Federal Trade Commission's interminable privacy
   hearings. CME's Shelley Pasnik warned, "Animated product
   spokescharacters are coming into our childrens' computers... Parents
   are deeply troubled by the intrusive nature of the online [world]
   coming into our homes." Hadn't she read Kurt Anderson's editorial in
   The New Yorker this week, that the onslaught of 'toons signals a
   cultural renaissance in the U.S.? Doh!

        The Center for Media's alarums sound familiar. Supporters of the
   notorious Communications Decency Act cried that "pornography is coming
   into our home computers" and used the same excuse of "protecting
   children" to justify passing the law.
