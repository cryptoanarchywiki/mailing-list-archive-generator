I agree, I think the political debates can be better handled on the CP
list rather than here. In that light I have created a PGP 5.5 digest that
covers the various threads on this topic from the CP list, the open PGP
list and the PGP Users lists (for the neswgroups you are on your own). I
will also provide a daily digest as long as these threads continue
(cut-off time 5pm central time zone). Anyone wishing to receive a copy let
me know (digest, daily, or both).

An excellent suggestion. Perhaps you could detail your ideals on these
areas so we can work on them.
