This is true but mainly I think for _storage_ keys.  PGP is being
discussed as an email communications system.  It's probably just as
likely that your email will disappear down a black hole as that you
forget your keys.

Your analogy doesn't fit.

All you're encrypting is something sent over a fairly unreliable
communications link.  If you lose the key, well heck you just get the
sender to resend it.  Happens every day with or without crypto.

(So you generate a new key, and get it certified, and publish your
revocation cert., if you have one).

This is the same mistake that Freeh and company make in arguing for
GAK.  It's a flawed argument.

Email itself is pretty fragile, and email is not commonly used for
long term storage.  (What are PGP are thinking? "gee, how best can we
best archive our master source tree ... I know we'll email it to our
colleague over here and delete it before I get confirmation it
arrived"?).

Way I understand "data recovery" is that you have a recovery mechanism
for stored data.  Like you have backups of the keys for your hard disk
driver level encryption program, or encrypted back up program.

You either have misunderstood the data recovery argument, or are
attempting to rejig it to fit your argument.

I'm pretty sure said cypherpunks were chanting about storage keys:
keys for data stored on your disk, as opposed to the GAKkers wanting
access to your communications keys.

Bingo.  And your data is where?  On your disk.  Not in limbo being
passed around the flaky sendmail/mailserver hodge-podge that is
Internet mail.

No, no!  The simple solution to fragile encryption on fragile
communications data is to keep a copy of the email you sent!  Encrypt
and backup the keys for that all you want, and you won't get any GAK
complaints.

No you didn't, you built a GAK system.

Yes, and your archives are going to be where?  On backup tapes, on an
encrypted partition on his hard disk... not in the email system.

Sad story.  I venture to suggest, however, that the product source
code was not stored solely in your email box, nor I expect did the
last copy of your source tree happen to be en-route in encrypted
email which only he had the key for.

> Your spouse might need access to financial records.

She might.  In which case you might secret split the key to your
encrypted partition, your lawyer and her, or whatever.

Nope, that's not it.  Data recovery is being able to recover stored
data.  "Key escrow" and "key recovery" are newspeak terms defined by
the GAKkers which mean that they want access to your communications
keys.  Your response should be to widely field systems using forward
secrecy, not to go along and implement GAK for them. 

[description of PGP GAKware elided]

If any PGP employees want a job working for a company which doesn't do
GAK, contact me off list, encrypted mail preferred.
