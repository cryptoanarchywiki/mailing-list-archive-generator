Why screw around with a sniper rifle when you can get Chinese clones of the
Stinger missile for $700-800?  Besides, they can come in handy when they
send in the helicopters with mounted machine guns a la Waco.

Mrs. Shirley Allen has been captured and is getting her mandatory
psychiatric exam.  Her family is celebrating, according to ABC news.
Anyone think she will be declared sane?  If so, I have some excellent
Florida swampland for sale...  Reality is a symptom of alcohol deficiency!

ObTongueInCheekFearmongeringThought:
How many Cypherpunks are vulnerable to this "psychiatric imbalance
allegation" attack?  Tim May is obviously an anti-social survivalist gun
freak, (like me, but with a bigger ammo stockpile--I'm jealous) Vulis is
obviously a closet bisexual deviant/pedophile (especially if he posts those
"Timmy Mayonnaise" ASCII art spams), Bill Geiger is a rabid anti-government
extremist a la McVeigh, and TruthMonger--need I say more?  It only takes
one disgruntled relative to "Allen" somebody...which in itself is a
powerful motivation to engage in anti-social behavior.  Hint: Look up what
happened to almost everyone who knew Stalin as a child...
