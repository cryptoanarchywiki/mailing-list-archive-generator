The NSA claimed that, but the chip itself didn't implement it -
all of that was external to the chip, and even if you believe that
the NSA wasn't cheating at first by keeping both halves in one place, 
all they need to do is change their own rules and then they can start.

Doing secret-sharing is important, and it's often hard to find a 
good algorithm to implement it; using the regular secret-sharing 
method to reconstruct the one key needed to feed into your program
means your program really only uses one key...  
				Thanks!
