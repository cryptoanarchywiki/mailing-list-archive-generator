Yes. Nobody but the policy can stop them and have a deeper look.

Yes, they can make statistics. Personal specific? No. Not here.

Yes. They have the right to close the door. Even for minutes.

Do you own your house? If not, why do you stop your house owner from
snooping in your flat? It's his ressource. Why do you encrypt e-mails over
your provider's lines? It's his ressource.
