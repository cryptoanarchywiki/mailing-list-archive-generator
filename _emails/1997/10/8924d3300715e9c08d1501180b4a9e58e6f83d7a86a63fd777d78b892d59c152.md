You are adopting a narrow technical meaning of key escrow.  Key escrow
also has another meaning in common parlance: third party access to
communications.  Now I know this common parlance isn't technically
accurate, but "key escrow" itself is a piece of newspeak, a clever
term coined by secret service / government spin doctors.  It has
entered the language like it or not (I don't like it).  This common
parlance meaning is probably more widely understood and used than the
technical meaning you are using.

With that in mind, you may start to see why people, such as Schneier,
and others over the last few days have been telling you "you're
picking nits".

Point is pgp 5.5 allows other people to have access to your
communications.  Your SMTP policy enforcer even attempts to enforce
this.  You also described a feature whereby an administrator could
remotely configure and restrict functionality in pgp 5.5 mail client
(I am unclear as to whether this allows the admin to enforce snoop
access or not).

Your own term CMR (Corporate Message Recovery) isn't that accurate a
description itself, it's a bit of a euphamism at best.  What you're
recovering is transient communications which don't need recovering
anyway.  What PGP is really up to is enforcing capability for
Corporate Message Snooping.

First point, which I'm getting bored of repeating: keys have different
uses.  Storage keys, transient communications keys, signature keys.
You're using one key for all 2 functions; that is the root of your
problems and dilemmas.  You're using what should be a storage key to
receive transient communications, then you're proceeding to wonder why
this causes you to have the undesirable situation of having a GAK
compliant system (or more properly trying and failing to argue that
you don't have one).

You know, what they're doing: it's not so bad for data encrypted on
their disks.  They can acheive the departmental level escrow to
distribute risk just the same with this form of escrow.

You don't need to escrow transient communications keys at all anyway.

Your pgp 5.5 isn't going to help recover the actual data of value, all
those stored CAD files...  You know why?  Because they're on the disk,
not in transit in the email system.  So you haven't solved the claimed
problem.

If you want to do something about the claimed problem work out some
secret splitting solutions to better distribute trust for escrowed
storage keys.  (Now this is a real use for escrow: the company is safe
guarding it's own encrypted data on disks and tapes for it's own
benefit).

Nope, your responsibility should be to solve their problems.  (Which
as I show above you have not done.)  Actually your responsibility to
live up to the reputation PRZ transfered to PGP Inc dictates that you
should also do what you can do not build systems which help GAKkers.

Instead your responsibility appears increasingly to produce systems
which smooth the way for coming mandatory GAK by implementing systems
which are GAK ready.

Or if you deny that one, at least you are weakening your
communications security for practically no gain.

Yeah, OK, you don't seem to be managing very well :-)

(Sorry, you asked for it.  I don't actually mean to be rude, I would
just like to get the points across, and to influence PGP to recover
gracefully from this tactical and reputational mistake.)

This is why I was asking above about separate signing keys.  They
surely don't need to stick the signature keys in the safe!!!  In fact
it is counter-productive even for hard-nosed corporate lawyers, and
$$$ driven scruple-short company execs: if they can't prove an
employee penned something they can't use this to prove a case against
him.  If they've got a copy of the signature key, they can forge
signatures which makes signatures useless in litigation involving
company and employee.

It's all screwey because you've got key functionality which belongs in
different keys mixed up.

You should have 3 types of key:

1. signature keys
2. transient encryption keys
3. storage keys

The signature keys you never escrow.  You certify.  If something goes
wrong you re-issue, release revocation cert, and re-certificate.

The transient encryption keys are for communications, you delete them
immediately after use.  Yes I'm talking forward secrecy here.  If you
don't like forward secrecy, well at least don't escrow the encryption
keys.

Storage keys you make damn sure you can recover.  You escrow these for
real.  Company safe sounds about right.  Secret splitting could be
nice also.

There is no advantage; the systems are approximately equivalent in
flexibility of architecture.  You can acheive the exact same
architecture with key escrow; just escrow the keys with your backup
czar.

You shouldn't be recovering transient messages, you should be
recovering stored data.
