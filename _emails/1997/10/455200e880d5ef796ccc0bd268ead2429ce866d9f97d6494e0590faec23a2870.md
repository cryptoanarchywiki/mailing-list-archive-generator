Decay, rather than fission, I suppose.   I believe there's a treaty
prohibiting nuclear weapons in space.  Not so surprising if they're
inpractical - political points for nothing.

Replacement of tritium is certainly the dominant need.
As for the decay products - it depends how close they get to pure 239.

Half-lives: (years)

Pu 238       89
Pu 239    24000
Pu 240     6500
Pu 241       15
Pu 242   400000
D             0.015
T            12.3

The only books I have to hand contain _thermal_ cross-sections.  :(

If it's an H-bomb I was under the impression you don't care that
desperately about the size of the plute yield - only that it is enough
to start the fusion.

Anybody know what happened to the proposed fissionless H-bomb of the '60s ?
Presumambly it never got working.
