Adding the feature clearly will be easy.  But persuading the people
using the non-CMR enabled software base to downgrade will be a big
problem.  I wonder how many people will still using old versions years
later.  There is a huge inertia to not upgrade that frequently.
People don't like upgrading, companies don't like upgrading, it costs
time, money, it's unwanted hassle.  

I'm guilty of this myself in some areas.  `do fix what isn't broken'.
Eg I'm using an ancient beta Xfree86, and hacking around the expiry
simply because I can't be bothered to download and install the next
version.

At dcs.exeter the admins were _way_ behind.  I had netscape2, and then
3 installed for myself and friends to use, while they were still
trundling along with an antique NCSA Mosaic beta version or something.
I had gcc-273 installed in my own filespace and they had gcc-258 or
something (it matters if you're using templates.. the old ones are
more broken).

You would've thought, yes.  Even from a security point of view,
forgetting political arguments CDR is better.
