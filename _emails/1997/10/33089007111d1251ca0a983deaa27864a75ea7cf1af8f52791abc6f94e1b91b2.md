I conceed that it may not be the Pu decay products that cause the
limited shelf life of thermonuclear weapons; I suspect that it may
be components of the 'pit', which produces the initial burst of 
neutrons to kick of the reaction (the pit is effectively a small
fission bomb). This 'pit' may contain tritium (pit design is a very
well guarded secret, and I've seen very little about it in the open
literature).

I disagree. A terrorist could obtain a bomb by being given it, 
stealing it, or buying it as a turnkey system. However, I suspect 
that anyone with the facilities to recondition one of these
weapons could also build one from scratch. 

I don't know if it's comforting or worrying knowing that these
devices degrade - any in the hands of terrorists have a limited
time that they are a threat, but that fact may pressure a terrorist
to 'use it or lose it'.
