Let me get this straight.  You are suggesting that anyone who wishes to be
anonymous should send a continuous 24 hour stream of low bandwidth data to
a central point in an effort to help keep anyone from knowing that they
wish to be anonymous.  

While this may help correct the latency problem, how do you think this will
effect anonymity?  Do you think that by sending a continuos stream of data
to the remailer, the sender will be less identifiable?
