[Apologies to my friends in Singapore, but I am NOT making this up. --Declan]

 And the top five toilets are...
     SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A drive to keep public toilets clean
and dry is meeting with overwhelming success, the Ministry of
Environment said in a "toilet alert" Tuesday.
     The statement said that in the first week "5,000
Singaporans have called the Clean Public Toilets hotline to
identify Singapore's model toilets and to vote for their top
five favorite toilets."
     The ministry launched a poster competition earlier in the
month featuring three model toilets and inviting the public to
identify their locations, as well as to nominate their favorite
public toilets in five categories of locations.
     Various prizes are involved, including a return trip to Hong
Kong to be won in a draw.
     Singapore is known for public campaigns promoting causes
ranging from discouraging littering to encouraging people to
have more children.
