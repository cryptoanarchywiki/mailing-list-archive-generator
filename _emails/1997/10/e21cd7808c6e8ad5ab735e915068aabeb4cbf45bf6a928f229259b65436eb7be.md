Hey, it's only a factor of two too expensive...  Moore's law is your friend...

The units currently have 2K bytes of EEPROM and 256K bytes of FLASH.
A little under half the flash is currently available, though it will
probably be taken advantage of during remote upgrades (coming soon to
a crypto phone near you...)  There's plenty of room for long term
storage of a reasonable set of public keys.  Private or symmetric keys
present a problem, since then you've got a long term secret to store
somewhere.

To forestall a bunch of questions about remote upgrades:  

    (1) there is a jumper on the write line to the FLASH.  If you're
        totally paranoid, leave it in the "Read Only" position.
    (2) upgrades will be digitally signed.
    (3) It'll be a "pull" upgrade.  I.e., you have to request the
        upgrade.  They're not just pushed down your throat.

I can pretty much be done all in software on a laptop.  
I've explained the details several times.  Perhaps if folks we're
paying me lots of money for the info, they would listen closer ;-)

The primary thing you lose is the simple integration with the
telephone.  A small (cheap) hardware hack can work around this.  Yes,
I know you'd prefer not to have any non-standard hardware, but on the
other hand, if the system is a pain in the ass to use, nobody is going
to use it.

The unit currently runs at 14.4k.  A 4800 b/s fallback mode is
currently under development.

Fixable with software and MIPS (you've got those).  Take a look at
those nice USR and Polycom full duplex speaker phones.  There's
nothing magic in them.  Notice the neat little song they play when you
power them up.  It's a training tone used to compute the impulse
response of the room.

Pretty much everything you need is already there.  It's a question of
integration.
