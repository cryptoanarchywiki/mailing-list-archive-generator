In your excitement you might have misunderstood what I was trying to
say:

Implying, that the freedom of an (average) person does not get
infringed by (privacy-intrusive) policies "because they can always
choose a different company" is IMHO plainly incorrect and out of
day-to-day reality for most people.
(Also note, that I am not saying companies don't have the right to
have such policies)
The truth is, that even with proper (college and beyond) education
and sincere effort to make something happen for yourself, it takes
quite a bit to get to a point of being totally free to choose your
employer based on mere policies. And that will probably not change
for most people.

Do you really expect single mothers with 3 kids to have the time to
do it to the degree of being able to _freely choose_ their
employers?? Or even Joe Average, who just came out of College and
has $100 000 school-loan-debt?

My point being, that not everybody is in a position to make
themselves "more marketable" to the point of having companies
begging for you, even if they wanted to. And that applies to most
people. (Congrats to the fortunate exceptions.)

Ciao
