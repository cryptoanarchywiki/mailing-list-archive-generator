Uh, don't understand the question. The issue is that it's being encrypted
to multiple keys for one recipient.

But, for the fifth or sixth time, _that isn't being shipped as standard 
by PGP_.

Really? I seem to recall Jon Callas saying my system 'redesigned CMR' 
but was simpler than theirs. The mere fact that CMR requires an enforcer 
implies that it's a convoluted and hasty design.

But it can't; for a start 2.6-based GAK won't interoperate with 
international versions the way that CMR will. Cutting the US off from
encrypted mail from the rest of the world would probably not go down
too well.

Lucky, one question: wouldn't you be complaining if Netscape or Microsoft
were shipping a system which enforced encryption to snooping keys? Why should 
we feel any differently about PGP?
