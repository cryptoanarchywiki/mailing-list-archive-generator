Ira Magaziner, Clinton's Net-advisor, spoke today at the District of
Columbia Bar Association, Computer and Telecommunications Law section
conference. A brief report, as told to me by someone who was there:

>Magaziner said Clinton and Gore specifically oppose mandatory
>domestic key recovery. Said they're still fighting it
>out within the administration and hope to work out a
>reasonable compromise. Aligned himself pretty clearly
>with the commercial, not the law enforcement side. Said
>that when Freeh waves around the "four horsemen," he's
>hard-pressed to come up with an informed answer. Said
>NSA had been involved in lobbying on the Hill.

Also, a Senate committee today approved the nomination of David
"Crypto-Ambassador" Aaron to be Under Secretary of Commerce for
International Trade. Aaron has been for the last year trying to export the
FBI's crypto-proposals for mandatory Big Brother cryptoware. (And
unconfirmed reports say he's been getting into fights not just inside the
OECD in Paris, but outside: apparently he's tussled with Parisian cabbies
more than once...) Aaron's nomination now goes to the full Senate; no vote
has been scheduled yet.
