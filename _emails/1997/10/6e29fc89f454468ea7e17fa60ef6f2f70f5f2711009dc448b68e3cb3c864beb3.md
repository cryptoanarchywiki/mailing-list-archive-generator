Isn't it the whole presumption that what Alice is sending is important
company information? That is, that Alice *is* a 'legal beagle' or some
such?  Casual or semi-private email may or may not be allowed, 
depending on how paranoid or repressive the company, but that isn't 
the issue, as I see it.  The issue is 'important company email'.
