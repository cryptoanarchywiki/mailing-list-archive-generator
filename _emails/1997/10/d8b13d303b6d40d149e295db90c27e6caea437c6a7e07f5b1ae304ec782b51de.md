III.  Hot Tip

If you have Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 and WebPrinter or ClickBook, 
you have the ultimate web printing tool!  You are capable of printing 
multiple linked web pages in a book with one click (almost)!

Try this:
1.  Launch Microsoft Internet Explorer 4
2.  Browse to the site you want to print, e.g.
	http://www.ffg.com/corpinfo/
2.  Click File/Print...
3.  Select your ClickBook printer driver from the Name drop down list
4.  Check "Print all linked documents" and "Print table of links"
5.  Click OK
NOTE: make sure WebPrinter/ClickBook is done procesing pages before 
clicking the Print button. (In this example there should be 11 pages 
received)

This is truly "The best way yet to print the 'Net!"

If you don't have WebPrinter yet, then get it!
