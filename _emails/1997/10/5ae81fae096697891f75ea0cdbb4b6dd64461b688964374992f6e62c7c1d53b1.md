Thanks for the comments, and the support is nice, too.

As Rick notes, the whole "foobar recovery" (where foobar may be plaintext
messages or keys) technology is untested, besides being dangerous in
various ways.

It represents an escalation of complexity, both for the users and the
developers. (My message is being directed at the OpenPGP folks trying to
figure out what features to support, not to PGP, Inc., which can make its
own decisions about how to spend its engineering and marketing
resources...though I hope they are taking the reactions of many of us to
heart.)

At this stage, where governments of the world are planning to make foobar
recovery mandatory (either GAK or GAP), it's a bad time to launch an
untested and potentially dangerous technology. As others have noted,
Congress is already using PGP's support of message recovery as evidence
that industry can rise to the challenge of providing message recovery for
law enforcement.

OpenPGP needs to stick to basics. And PGP, Inc. needs to get back to basics.
