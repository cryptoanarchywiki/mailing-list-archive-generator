Odd thing, in fact. Of course, Win95 and Mac are almost the same. They
run with all of the same controls, near exact features and functions.

It should also be noted that while most Netscape releases come out on Win95
first, Mac versions are never far away. For that matter, Netscape has also
been ported to X-Win.

Does this mean Win is a Mac copy? Absolutely. Does it mean M$ is bad?
Depends. MCI and Sprint provide the same service that AT&T used to, but
with minor changes. Microsoft has done the same.

Fare trade? Inability to place money into research&development? A sublime
desire to have that apple pie that was gone by the time he got to it?
Who knows what ethics are in Mr. Gates mind.
