New Power-line Telephone Technology Set To Hit UK

LONDON - Electricity companies may become the latest providers of telephone
and Internet services to your home.

Forget separate lines from telephone or cable companies: you might talk and
send computer data at high speed via existing power cables -- the same lines
that supply electricity to your washing machine and fridge.

The electricity lines have been able to carry telephone signals and computer
data for some time but not in a commercially viable way because they were
too slow.

Britain's Norweb Communications, part of United Utilities, and Canada's
Northern Telecom, however, appear to have developed a new technology to
speed things up considerably.

"The technology has been successfully tested, is ready for the mass market,
has the potential to stimulate major growth in Internet use, and will change
the future for electricity utilities," the firms said in a statement.

They will announce details at a news conference on Wednesday, but media
reports here said the new technology allows computer data to be whizzed
around at more than 10 times the speed of current average Internet modems.
