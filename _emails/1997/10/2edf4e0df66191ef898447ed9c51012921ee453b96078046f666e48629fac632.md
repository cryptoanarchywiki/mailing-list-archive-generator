Adam,
How does your system prevent the employer  from fabricating forged
signatures in a PK system that uses the same key for signing and
decrypting? And if you don't use such a system, then how do you deal with
future versions of the software that will allow the user to swap DH keys
from underneath the ElGamal keys?

Thanks,
