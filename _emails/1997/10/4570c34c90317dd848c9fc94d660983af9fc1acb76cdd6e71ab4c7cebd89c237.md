This whole sob story makes me want to puke.  First of all, there are
thousands of cities in the US with a higher wage-to-cost-of-living ratio
that socialist cesspool New York City.  Anyone stupid enough to volunteer
to live in a city with one of the most confiscatory tax policies in the
country deserves what they get.

I currently live in a 900 square foot, 2-bedroom condo in Vacaville,
California, in a not-so-nice part of town.  I have to keep paint on hand to
cover the gang graffiti that grows in my carport, in 2 years I have
personally witnessed 2 gang assaults, (one of which resulted in an
individual being medevac'd to a local hospital) and I have good reason to
believe that there are some drug dealers moving into my neighborhood.  I am
currently paying a $67,000 mortgage for the privilege of living here.  For
the same money, I could purchase a 40 acre woodlot with a stream running
through it, and a 4 bedroom house, near Clare, Michigan.  Why do I stay
here?  Mainly so I can be near my wife and son, but I also have a job that
I really like, even though it doesn't pay much.  Does my financial
situation suck?  You bet!  My finances are in worse shape than those of the
woman described above.  Do I expect (or deserve) the pity of others?
Absolutely not!  Do I need some kind of government handout to save me from
my pathetic life?  Absolutely not!

I am where I am at because of choices I have made, and I can make choices
that will change my situation for the better.  This is the beauty of
America.  If you are willing to do what it takes (although most people
aren't) you can improve ypur lot in life.
