Shut up Kent, yes, we know it is you posting this rant.  The above fails
due to one single little key word "his personal key." If it is his
personal key, then the business has no business reading his email.  If it
indeed is a corporate key you should have said so, and he - the employee
could have arranged for his passphrased to be escrowed with the company's
principals, if that wasn't done, the company is stupid and doesn't deserve
to survive.

Correction: not only will they look incompetent, but in reality this
will prove that they are!  Single point of failure in any system is
something every company should consider.  It's the same with filing taxes
so the IRS doesn't come down on your head, making backups of your servers
incase the hard drive crashes and buying all sorts of insurance.

This is a stupid arguement.  Go away.
