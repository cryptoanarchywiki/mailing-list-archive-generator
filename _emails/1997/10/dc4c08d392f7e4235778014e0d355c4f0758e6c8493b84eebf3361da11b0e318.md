This would be a nice example if it were true. But it isn't true in the
U.S., for example.  I don't know the situation in France, the U.K.,
Germany, etc., but at least in the U.S. this is generally not so.

In California, and in other states I suspect, suicide has nothing to do
with probate. Were I to kill myself tonight, my heirs would inherit as if I
had died of some disease, or been murdered by the Thought Police.

(ObAproposOfNothing, I was out working in my yard last night, with Monterey
and Pacific Grove gloriously visible in the distance. Had I been looking
with my telescope or binoculars, I could've seen John Denver's plane go
down.)
