It could be an interesting legal battle. Intel will certainly bring a lot
of firepower to bear on this.

Interestingly, one of the reasons the Pentium, and Pentium II, is being
fabbed in Israel (they ignored my "soft target" evaluation) and Ireland
(ditto), is to get production inside the borders of the area, including the
European Community.

So, what happens when Pentium IIs are drop-shipped straight to Penang,
Malaysia for packaging and test and are then drop-shipped directly to
"developing nations"? Where did the export occur?

With crypto code, it was the shipment of intellectual property to a
non-U.S. nation. E.g., if RSADSI sends programmers to Ireland to write a
crypto program so as to bypass U.S. laws, that's where the violation
supposedly occurred. (We haven't seen major prosecutions based on this
interpretation, yet.)

But I suppose it won't be too much of a hassle. Intel and other computer
companies dealt with the COCOM laws adequately, and the new proposal,
though pissing into the wind, won't even be as onerous as COCOM was.
