Actually the it is the new pgp5.0 servers that are having the problems.
The PGP Inc. server may be doing ok but they are not part of the Network
(they have cut-off their connection and are not sending out nor receiving
keyring updates to the other servers).

I agree that the 100% replication can't last the number of keys and key
requests will become beyond what a PC based system can handle.

Yes but everyone's Ip's aren't changing every week. It's not just a matter
of the multitude of requests that would be required in this systems as
everyone will need to update all their keys on a weekly basis but also the
DNS records will be having this turnover. the DNS system has enough
problems as it is let alone what would happen with the implementation of
forward secrecy would cause (my best guess that within a week or two the
whole thing would crash and burn).

Even a weekly turnover of all keys would be too much.

You would have to otherwise you would run out of storage very quickly.

The best I can think of handleing the key distribution problem is to
attach a copy of your key to every correspondence and then have the client
automatically check and see if it has changed and update the keyring as
needed. If find both the automatic processing & sending the key with every
messages quite bothersome (these are PKS implementation issues that should
be covered in a different thread).

Well IMHO this scenario does not forward your cause much. If the physical
security is that bad (unrestricted access to equipment, weak passphrases,
Post-it-Notes, ...ect) then the information an attacker is looking for is
more than likely going to be available to him without messing with the PGP
keys. If the reverse is true and the physical security is strong the the
case for short-term separate keys is gone as the risk of exposure to a
long term key is greatly reduced.

I have some serious reservations of the security implications of frequent
changes to the keys. It has the potential for the user to disregard all
changes to the keys (think how quick the warning pop-ups in Netsacpe get
ignored and/or disabled by the user). The other possibility it to make the
key changes transparent to the user which I do not like at all for obvious
reasons (I do not see complete isolation of the user from the cryptosystem
as a Goodthing(TM) ).

Well I have been thinking more on this. I still am not sold that separate
keys are needed but even if they are I am inclined to believe that PGP is
not the place for them. I am leaning towards the opinion that file
encryption should be handled by the files system along with other disk
security features. This seems more appropriate than having your e-mail
client doing individual file encryption.

I do my keylookups automatically durning the msg filtering process which
is done in parallel to the message Dl's. The outbound message lookups are
a little more time consuming but is compensated by fewer keys to look for
both because fewer messages on the outbound side and the use of key caches
on the client machine for the most used keys for sig verification and
encryption. Also logging of e-mail addresses that do not use PGP cuts down
on the number of lookups needed ( I only keep trusted keys in my pubring
all others are kept in the cache for performance reasons ).
