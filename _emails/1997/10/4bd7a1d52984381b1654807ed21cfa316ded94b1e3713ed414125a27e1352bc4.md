Hell of a way to reverse-engineer just about anything. How long you figure
it will be before they start coming out wit industrial units just for
materials analysis?  I wonder how good it would be at determing the layout
of a die through the carrier...

Pretty nifty materials analysis tool. Maybe they should shoot the atom toward
the NMR...
