This isn't quite as bad as the current setup with pgp5.5. We've set up
something almost like this within my department. We have a shared key for
the department, and private keys individually. I'm pretty leery of the
concept of a shared group key, but for certain types of messages, it is not
too terrible a solution. Of course, you have problems when someone leaves
the group, as you now have to change the master key for the group. I'd
actually prefer to be able to use conventional crypto for when we need to
distribute new passwords amongst my group, as it is easier to deal with ftmp
(for the group where i work anyway) without the difficulties of having to
revoke/reissue the dept key.

One thing that I think PGP needs more than anything else, is to make it easy
to build lists of keys to encrypt to. Version 4.5 has this feature, which is
why I'm using it. I would hope that 5.5 does, and will also let the user
create whatever type of keys he wants and use conventional crypto as well.
I'm expecting a copy here soon, so will get to play with it then.

I can't say I really like version 5.0 much.
