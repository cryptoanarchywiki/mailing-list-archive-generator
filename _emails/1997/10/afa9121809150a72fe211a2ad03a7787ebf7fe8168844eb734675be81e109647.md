The CMR acronym stands for "Corporate Message Recovery".

CMR is the corporate disaster recovery mechanism built in to pgp5.5
(and some support for it in pgp5.0).

Government Access to Keys.  Governments seem to have an unhealthy
desire to obtain your communications keys.  They use lots of slick PR
terms to make their snooping urges seem less obnoxious -- things like
"clipper", "key escrow", "key recovery", etc.

CMR doesn't do it.  Why people are getting upset is that it could be
used for this though.

Yes, CMR is to allow companies to recover email in case of employee
forgetting passphrase, or is on holiday, or leaves on bad terms,
or dies unexpectedly.

PGP2.x doesn't have CMR in it.  You don't have to use the CMR feature
on your own key with pgp5.x.  The argument is more about what it could
be used for by government in the future.
