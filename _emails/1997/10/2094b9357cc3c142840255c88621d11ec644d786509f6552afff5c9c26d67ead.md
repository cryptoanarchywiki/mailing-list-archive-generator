Jon's statement and my statement are consistent, if you look a little 
more closely.

In my early days on the list I spent a great deal of effort arguing
exactly this point, perhaps even with you.  Perhaps you recall my
discussions of the "key-safe" model.  (I suppose we could check the
archives...) At that time, however, my proposal was branded as key
escrow and hence evil, and the STANDARD REPLY WAS THAT IT WOULD BE
FAR, FAR BETTER TO JUST ENCRYPT TO A COMPANY KEY AS WELL AS THE
PRIVATE KEY.  *You* may even have made such arguments. 

Now that PGP has actually gone and implemented exactly what some
months ago was the preferred alternative, the jack-rabbit meme-ridden
collective cypherpunk semiconciousness awakens from its hazy stupor
and says "Huh! GAK!", and parades Key Escrow as a safer solution.

So, for sure, either the thinking those months ago was shallow, or the
thinking now is shallow.  The third alternative, that the thinking has
remained at a constant level, is interesting to contemplate.

Yes, I did mention the matters of history, backward compatibility, 
and expedience under tight schedules as important factors.

I don't remember saying that, but the point is obvious, anyway.  The
argument that leaking company secrets is the primary concern is
fallacious for exactly the reason you mention -- there are a thousand
ways to leak data out. 

There are other, more realistic concerns.  Is the employee exchanging
encoded gif images with his friends? Is the employee telling the truth
about an exchange with a customer? Is the employee spending all his
time reading mailing lists devoted to home-brew-beer, and other
hobbies? Is the employee distributing porno images from an ftp site on
a company computer? Is the employee running a consulting business on
the company computers?  For investigating any such suspicions, 
snooping incoming mail would be just as valuable as snooping outgoing 
mail. 

BTW: You may laugh -- But I have seen real-life instances of each of
these examples.

I reckon local key escrow is better, myself.  But be real for a
moment, Adam.  If they had designed a system with "local key escrow"
they would have been crucified by the butterfly brains on cypherpunks
far more intently than they are being lambasted for CMR.  The very
phrase "KEY ESCROW IN PGP" would have turned the cypherpunk group mind
into quivering jelly.

It doesn't matter what they are saying, really.  They designed 
something with a set of constraints, one of which was the meme of 
antipathy to anything that could be termed "key escrow".  

I understand what Lucky meant when he said that PGP had pulled the
greatest hack ever on corporate America.  It's so good that you have
to conceal your mirth, for fear of screwing it up...
