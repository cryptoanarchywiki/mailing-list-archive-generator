Funny you should ask that. There's a bunch of lawyerly traffic on
DIGSIG@VM.TEMPLE.EDU, run off of LISTSERV@VM.TEMPLE.EDU. I've sent you the
welcome message under separate cover. Of course, if you'd been subscribing
to e$pam, you'd know all of this. :-). (Of course, if I could just get some
keyword searchable archives of e$pam up and running, you wouldn't have to
subscribe to a mail-firehose like e$pam ;-)).

Take a look at:

Jane Winn is god. (this week anyway)

Cheers,
