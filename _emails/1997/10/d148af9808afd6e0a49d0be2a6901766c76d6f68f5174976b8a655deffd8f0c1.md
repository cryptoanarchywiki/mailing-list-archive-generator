There is reasonable justification for key escrow, or recovery features
for _stored_ encrypted information.  The rate at which people forget
passwords alone suggests that this would be a good idea.

However the PGP design does much more than that: it allows third and
fourth parties to decrypt messages in transit.

I think they could have implemented recovery of stored encrypted
files, and of saved email archives more easily without including
recovery information over the wire.  It's a security risk to send
recovery encrypted info over the wire encrypted to long term public
keys.

Me either.

He could have built storage escrow with much less argument; almost no
argument in comparison I would expect.

The obvious thing I think is for pgp to build systems which can
automatically interoperate with either.
