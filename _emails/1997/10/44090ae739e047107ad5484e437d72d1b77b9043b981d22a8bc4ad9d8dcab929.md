Those who are newcomers to the list should know that Vulis has never
presented any evidence substantiating his vague claims that Stronghold 
is insecure or has backdoors (or whatever the claims were).  Vulis is
conducting a personal vendetta against one of C2Net's staff members and 
anyone who happened to be or become associated with him.
