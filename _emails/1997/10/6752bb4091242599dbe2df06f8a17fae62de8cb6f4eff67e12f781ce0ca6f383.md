I concur.

This is not quite correct.  I can't seem to find my Commodore 128
Programmer's Reference Guide, (of all the things I lost going to the PC, I
miss my PRG the most.  It contains complete BASIC & assembler language
reference guides, lists EVERY memory address used by the OS and what it
does, register-level programming info on every chip, and even schematics
for my 128!  Unfortunately, nobody seems to publish such a book for PC's,
but I digress.)  The branching instructions used 1 byte for the in
struction, followed by 1 data byte which was a signed integer.  This
allowed one to branch up to 127 bytes ahead, or 128 bytes back from the
current instruction address register value.  The coolest thing about this
was that if you were able write your code to branch and not JMP or JSR,
your code could be located anywhere in memory and it would work perfectly,
which was very useful when writing interrupt wedges that were supposed to
work on the C-64 and the C-128, or that could be loaded in various places
in memory.

This is where self-modifying code came in handy.  During initialization, a
self-mod routine would increment the addresses in the jump table so they
pointed to the proper addresses of the respective routines.

If I remember correctly, there were all of 5 or 10 bytes available for
"user programs", depending on which OS functions you were willing to break.

My first computer was a Commodore VIC-20. 5 points and Geek of the Week to
the first email correctly specifying the "Basic Bytes Free" on a vanilla
VIC-20.

Real Programmers don't use symbolic addresses.
