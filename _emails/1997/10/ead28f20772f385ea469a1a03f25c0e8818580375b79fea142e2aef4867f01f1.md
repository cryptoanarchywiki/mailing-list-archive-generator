**********************************
Power play to plug in the Internet

In what could usher in a new era of competition between telephone
companies and electric utilities, engineers have developed a
breakthrough technology that lets homeowners make phone calls and
access the Internet at high speeds via the electric outlets in their
walls.

If the technology from United Utilities plc and Northern Telecom Ltd
proves commercially viable, it could transform power lines around the
world into high-speed conduits on the information superhighway.

Because electric utilities are wired into virtually every home and
business, the new technology could provide easy entry into the phone
and Internet access businesses, thus posing a serious threat to
current providers of those services.

United Utilities, a power company, and Northern Telecom, a Canadian
maker of telecommunications gear, confirmed that their system was
"ready for mass market", but declined to reveal details.  The two
companies have tested phone service over power lines in about a dozen
UK households over the past 12 months -- with positive results,
according to Alistair Henderson, chief of technology at Energis plc,
the telecommunications unit of National Grid Group plc.
