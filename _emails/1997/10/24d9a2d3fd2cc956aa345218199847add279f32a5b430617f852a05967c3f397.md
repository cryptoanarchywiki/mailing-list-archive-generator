PGP isn't using ARR (Additional Recipient Requests) for the old RSA
keys either, I don't think -- so I think a copy of pgp5.5 for business
which has been configured by an admin with the strictest settings
would not be able to generate RSA keys.

So the simple way seems to be to not escrow the private components of
the DSA signature key.  If people forget their passphrase, they'll
need to generate a new signature key and get it freshly certified by
the admin while he's recovering their encryption key.

Interesting question even if you are using separate signature keys.
You've got a new signature key.  You want to bind your recovered EG
keys to it.  So I guess you just strip the self-certificates from the
EG keys, and add new ones made by the new signature key.  You can
still decrypt messages, and even pgp5.0 would be able to cope with
that (it'll try to fetch keys to check the certification on the
signature key).
