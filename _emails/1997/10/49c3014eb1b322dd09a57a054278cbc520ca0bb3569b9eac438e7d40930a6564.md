* Defense lawyer Phillip Robertson, intending to make a dramatic
point in front of the jury at his client's robbery trial in Dallas,
Tex.,
in June, pointed the 9mm pistol used in the crime toward the jury
box, causing two jurors to fling their arms in front of their faces and
others to gasp audibly.  Though Robertson was arguing that his
client should be sentenced only to probation, the horrified jury gave
him 13 years.
