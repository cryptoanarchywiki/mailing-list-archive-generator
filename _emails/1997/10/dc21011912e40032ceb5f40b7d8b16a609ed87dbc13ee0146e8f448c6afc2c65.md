Sorry I misread your prior post.

The first context where I am aware of this use of the term orthogonal
is from language design -- it was promoted by Niklaus Wirth and other
purists, with languages like Pascal, Modula, CLU, and so on.  Larry
Wall's "perl" language, with its slogan "there's more than one way to
do it", is a direct revolt against the language purists.

The basic idea is that a computer language should have the minimum
number of constructs necessary to span the intended application.  So
for example, you don't provide hyperbolic trig functions, because the
user can implement them using simpler math functions.  On the other
hand, you do supply commonly used math functions that would otherwise
require iterative algorithms.

I do believe the use of the term this way was inspired by the 
notion of a 'basis' in a vector space -- a set of orthogonal
vectors that span the space, ideally, unit vectors.
