You can negotiate in advance.  Many doctors will cut their rates for surgery 
if you tell them you are uninsured.  We actually called around to a number of 
hospitals recently to see if they would discount a birth for cash up front 
and we were able to find hospitals willing to cut their rates.  A 50% cut 
seems the standard range.

The magic words are "Hill-Burton Act."  Most hospitals have accepted Hill-
Burton Act funding and are required to admit people with or without 
insurance.  Some resist of course.

Me too.  In 20 years, however, you and I will be drafted into Medicare 
(against our wills) unless the system is substantially modified by then (the 
most likely outcome).
