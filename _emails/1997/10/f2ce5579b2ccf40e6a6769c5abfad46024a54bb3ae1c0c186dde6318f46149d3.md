I'd figure pretty much anything from Bamford's _The Puzzle Palace_ would
work, but the stuff on Operation Shamrock (interception of cable traffic)
might be of particular interest. Also the parts about "intelligence sharing"
with the Brits and Australians -- just because the NSA can't tap it doesn't
mean they can't get it from our "friends." No doubt the Men From Fort Meade
have been as helpful in the other direction as well.

A particularly nice detail about Shamrock is that the FBI was using the NSA
to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance of "un-American" groups by
using ELINT, which was -- of course -- "born classified."

I'd cite details, but my Bamford seems to be MIA. Maybe the MIB came for
it. . .
