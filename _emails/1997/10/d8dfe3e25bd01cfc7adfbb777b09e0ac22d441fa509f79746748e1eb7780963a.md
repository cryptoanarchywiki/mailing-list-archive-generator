I will seriously consider it.

Were I to do this, I would like to donate the money to the EFF,
preferably through an ecash payment.  Then, you can buy a 486 you
consider to be suitable.  Also, donations to the EFF are tax
deductible, are they not?

What would be the odds of naming it the "Cantsin Remailer"?  Just
curious.  ;-)

The more I think about affinity remailers, the less off the wall they
seem to me.  It would really be rather neat if EFF supporters could
send a message through your remailer and then have the outgoing
message stamped with the amount contributed.  For those operating
anonymously it buys a mild amount of credibility, but you could also
imagine people sending non-anonymous messages through it: "See
everybody!  I gave $100 to the EFF!"

The publicity alone would probably be worth it for the first
organization to start doing this.  It should be good for a few
newspaper articles.  And it's certainly a novel and fun way to raise
money.
