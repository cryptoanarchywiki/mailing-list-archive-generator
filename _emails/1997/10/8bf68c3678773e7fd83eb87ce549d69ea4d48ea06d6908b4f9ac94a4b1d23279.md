                         PRIVACY SYMPOSIUM
                 Georgetown University Law Center
                          Washington, DC
                         October 20, 1997

A public symposium entitled "Privacy at the Crossroads: Law, Technology,
and Public Policy", will be held on October 20, 1997, at Georgetown
University Law Center in Washington, DC.

This symposium will look at emerging privacy issues in the legal and
technological world, with a particular focus on the European Union
Data Directive, privacy enhancing technologies, and the shape of
privacy protection in the next century.

These issues are rapidly coming to the fore with the adoption of the
European Union Directive and the increasing interest in techniques to
promote privacy protection, especially with the rapid flow and exchange of
information that is possible with electronic data.  Privacy has recently
been the subject of hearings before the Federal Trade Commission and it
is a central component of the new White House policy on Electronic
Commerce.

The symposium will take place on Monday, October 20, 1997, at the Gerwirz
Center of the Georgetown University Law Center, 600 New Jersey Avenue, NW,
Washington, DC.  The program will begin at 9 a.m. and conclude at 4 p.m.
Speakers will include many North American experts on privacy and technology
issues, including law professors, technologists, and commentators.

The symposium is sponsored by the Georgetown University Law Center, the
John F. Connelly Program in Business Ethics, Georgetown University School
of Business, the Communication, Culture, and Technology Program of
Georgetown University, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center.  This
is a free event open to the public.  No registration is required.
