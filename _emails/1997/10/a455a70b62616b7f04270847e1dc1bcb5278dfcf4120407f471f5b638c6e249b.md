In that case recovery can be much more simply and securely achieved
locally to the recipient.  Escrow or use locally stored recovery
information.  The CMR key is not needed for this functionality.

This is an independently good idea and would mitigate some of the
possibilites of CMR functionality being used for purposes other than
it's designers intended.

However it is hard to do; and the keys have different security focus
becuase it is hard to use user <-> user end to end TLS because of the
store and forward nature of email.
