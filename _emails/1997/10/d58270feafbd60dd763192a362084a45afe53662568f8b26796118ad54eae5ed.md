Crowds 1.0.3 is now available.  If you already agreed to our license
on our web page, there's no need to do it again; just send email to

crowds-support@research.att.com

from the previous email address that you gave us, and we'll send 1.0.3
to you.

The main change in 1.0.3 is a configuration file that eliminates the
need for command-line arguments to anon.pl, and that also enables us
to ship distributions ready to join our crowd (i.e., the registration
step is eliminated).  Hopefully this will make Crowds easier to use.
