Define "in transit".  Specifically, when exactly does email stop being
"in transit".  When it is received on a mail server?  Transfered to the
destination computer?  Displayed to the user?  Saved in an archive?

How long might a piece of email spend "in transit"?  Compare and contrast
with the amount of time a piece of data from an encrypted phone call
spends in transit.  Or an SSL protected HTTPS web transaction.

Do you understand the difference between transit times of a fraction
of a second and of days or weeks?  Does this suggest any differences in
the need for recovery of encrypted data "in transit"?

Not all communications are alike.  The longer data spends "in transit"
the more need there is for recovery features.
