Nope.  Like I said, I'm not selling Stronghold or any competing product, I
don't lose anything when someone foolishly buys it, so why should I present
any evidence?  I (and several other people on this mailing list) were threatened
by C2Net's lawyers; so to avoid unpleasant disputes, I told them I won't be
publishing whatever I might know about their product.

No I'm not.  What do I lose if someone not affiliated with me makes a
foolish purchasing decision?

That's why I complied with C2Net's request not to publish my opinions of
their product.

If this were true, then C2Net would encourage me to publicly present whatever
"evidence" I have so they'd be able to refute it.  This is not what they
asked me to do.

Keep in mind that "anonymous" is probably an employee of C2Net.  Several of
C2Net's shills used to post C2Net propaganda withouy revealing their C2Net
affiliation; they switched to anonymous remailers when their nyms were exposed.
