+Because when you ring the alarm bell on my system
+it is answered by law enforcement and it costs about 
+$10,000 a time to deal with the issue.

+Setting off fire alarms costs real money. 

    my only comment is: "may you have many false alarms."

    waving the big stick of law enforcement as a warning is nothing
    more than a pre-potty trained bully with a bunch of goons to 
    back him up as he stomps around his playpen.

    law enforcement did not deterred the hacks on the state department,
    the FBI, and even the CIA.  I dont advocate the hacks, but it is     
    amusing to watch the great watchdogs of security take a hit.

    with your spoiled brat rantings, you make your site as tempting as 
    some of the other nose tweakers who need a serious attitude adjustment

    in other words, get off your fucking horse, it has a broken leg.
    dont forget to call home, your mums waiting.

        attila out


+Incidentally the security line you are pushing is a crock. To get real
+security I believe you have to have feedback
+and monitoring. This is especially important in an institutional
+setting where you may not have complete control of critical
+infrastructure. For my application simply hoping the guys  with the
+white hats find security holes before those in the  black ones do is
+simply not enough.

+In any case I'm not as complacent as Attila seems to think the security
+model has been amply reviewed by the best
+in the field.

+Threatening to catch the malefactor and put him behind bars is a
+valuable additional security tool. The more bad guys there are behind
+bars the less time I have to spend worrying.
