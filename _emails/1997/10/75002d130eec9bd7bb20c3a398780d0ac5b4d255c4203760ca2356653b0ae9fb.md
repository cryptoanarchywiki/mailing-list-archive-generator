Bob asks Charlie, who is really behind K. Charlie must be able to point to
Alice. If he can't do that, Bob will sue him. (Like any customer fooled by a
McLain control signed and certified by Verisign, which revoke the
certificate due to a request from Microsoft.)

Alice is responsible for her key K. If X can fool Bob, he has access to the
secret part of K, so the problem goes to Alice. Alice can inform Charlie for
revoking the certificate. If she did this, the problem went to Charlie. If
he updated his public database, the problem went to Bob. If Bob did non
check nor get a real timestamp (I.e. eternity logfile), he has lost.
Otherwise he lost, because he knew, that Alice's key was comprimised before
delivery.
