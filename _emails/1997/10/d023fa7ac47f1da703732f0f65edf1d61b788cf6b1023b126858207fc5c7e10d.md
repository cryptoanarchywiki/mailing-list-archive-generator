Just to make things clear, none of us is arguing for any restrictions on a
corporation's adoption of CMR, nor of PGP, Inc.'s right to manufacture and
distribute CMR software.

Many of us think it is a foolish thing for PGP, Inc., especially, to be
building. Both because it helps Big Brother make his arguments (as he has
already, pace the testimony before Congress about key recovery being
practical because PGP, Inc. is now selling similar software), and because
of how it squanders the reputation capital of Phil Zimmermann and PGP, Inc.

Further, CMR addresses the wrong problems. For reasons I and Adam Back and
several others have discussed at length in the past couple of weeks.

Yep, they're already doing this. This was reported a week or so ago,
somewhere here in Cypherpunks.

Agreed. What amazes me is how PGP, Inc. would decide this should be a core
part of their company. "PGP for Business," indeed. What were they thinking?
