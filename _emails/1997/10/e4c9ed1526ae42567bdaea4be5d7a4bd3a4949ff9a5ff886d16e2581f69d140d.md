  What are the chances of her being found 'sane' if it might
result in a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the same
government who assaulted her out of Choatian expediency instead
of investing some 'quality time' in sharing a few cups of
coffee with her in order to avert such a ludicrous scenarios?

  My guess is that whoever is chosen to declare her 'batty' has
a bright, successful career ahead of them.
(But I would love to be pleasantly surprised.)
