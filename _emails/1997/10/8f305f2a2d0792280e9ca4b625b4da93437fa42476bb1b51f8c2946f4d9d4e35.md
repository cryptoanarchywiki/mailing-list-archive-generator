Reckon they'll twig, and charge you per megabyte to offer you the
"service" of allowing them to "recover" your communications in real
time.

At the same time they'll sell the package as "helping businesses to
recover data stored on disks".  

(I never did quite work out how this government mandated and managed
"communications key recovery service" helps you recover stuff stored
on your disk encrypted with storage keys you haven't given them (you
don't give them your real keys do you?)).
