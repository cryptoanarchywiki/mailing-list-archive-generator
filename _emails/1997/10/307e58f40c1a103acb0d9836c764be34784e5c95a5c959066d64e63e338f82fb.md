Unicorn,

In that piece of knowledge smashing, just as you do in most 
of your posts, you again mixed up things to make sure that everybody 
end up knowing less than when they started.

It is peoples like you that ended up with using Expectation of 
Privacy out of it's rightfull context.  Apart from various rulings of 
various judges that probably smoked various  herbs, can you please 
tell me how anybody can rightfully expect privacy when everything 
that permits them to exchange information is *owned* by somebody else 
and that the use of this equipment is there *only* for the activities 
of the owner of the equipment?  If it weren't of the business, the 
damn computer wouldn't be there.  And beside, the employee is not 
paid to chat with friends, he's paid to work.  If he doesn't want to 
work, just fine, but not on the company's pay...

Somehow, you basic premises always blows my mind.  I think that you 
are a *very* dangerous person.  I've been watching you for almost 
three years over Cypherpunks and e$-etc and other forums.   
Virtually *all* of your posts have this 
blow-up-their-basic-premises-and-let-them-with-nothing-but-confusion  
style.  Your style shows intelligence and skill in the way you do 
it, which rules out idiocy on your part.  So, clearly, you have 
an agenda. 

I cannot help but having the nagging feeling that you're on  some 
three-letter agency payroll because you have the uncanny habit of 
disrupting and diverting some important discussion.  I always wanted 
to killfile you but always refrained to do so just to be able to read 
the last finely crafted basic premises-smashing abomination.

So, again, which of the three-letter agency sends you a paycheck?  
Or are you doing is only for a secret decoration?
