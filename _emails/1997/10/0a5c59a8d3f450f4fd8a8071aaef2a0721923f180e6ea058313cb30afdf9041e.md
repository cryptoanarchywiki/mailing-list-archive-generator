Motivation is irrelevant.  The road to hell is paved with good
intentions.  All the sides in the argument (except for Freeh and the
USG/NSA) have good intentions (and perhaps even Freeh from his
perspective).  Fooh on good intentions.  Let's keep this discussion
focussed on:

  The design of systems which are hard for governments to abuse in
  introducing GACK

You made one contribution in this area in your last post.  Keep up the
technical contributions, and scenario likelihood evaluations.

If it doesn't need to be argued, why does pgp2.x and pgp5.x use long
term communication keys?  Why does pgp5.x then go exacerbate this
problem encouraging use of not one but two long term communications
keys.  Why does it provide recovery methods for long term
communications keys when the stated user requirement is to recover
stored email archives?

ie. the discussion just took this form:

Adam: X is a bad security idea.  X is used in pgp2.x and pgp5.x

Kent: modification Y to pgp5.x doesn't make it any worse

Adam: So?  It's still a bad idea, and here are ways to make it more
      secure, and harder for governments to abuse to boot

Kent: ?  (we're waiting)

Surely the most straight forward way to provide recovery for email
archives is to archive the emails encrypted to a storage-only key,
with this key escrowed in some way?  You then don't need to recover
email in transit -- you don't even have a copy of it.

This is clearly more resistant to government abuse.  Do you disagree?

(The above paragraph is basically all my CDR proposal is .. it seems
straight forward, intuitive, more secure; I went through and countered
your previous objections to worked example #1, you did not reply to
those counter-points).

You missed a couple:

3) the goverment will love to get come ask for your CMR key because it
protects all past emailed ciphertext

4) some governments (eg France) will probably ask for one of the CMR
keys to be theirs

Yes.  Several people have suggested this.  Also secret sharing is
being considered by PGP Inc for the next version I think.

I would think so.  This would argue for updating the CMR
communications key as frequency as is practicable to minimise danger.
(Same argument as update requirements for user communications keys).
Hal Finney discussed this requirement of matching expiry frequency on
comms keys & corresponding CMR keys a few messages back.

This suggests that Tim May is right, and the simplest solution is to
store the decrypted received emails in clear on the disk.  Most of the
companies are in fact storing on disk.

Could you provide a less emotive suitable alternative word which I can
use as a replacement to describe government communications key
grabbing attempts?  GACK is what Carl Ellison proposed as a more
accurate way to express "Goverment Access to Communications Keys" than
terms such as "key escrow", "key recovery", which are government
coined terms.  PGP Inc themselves being mostly cypherpunks and
pro-privacy people use the term GACK also.

GACK seems a pretty good acronym to me, accurate, descriptive.  Are we
getting goverment-correct now as well (as politically-correct)?  So
that we must not use terms which are offensive to governments?

(I will attempt to avoid negative political comments about PGP Inc's
implementation, and phrase in terms of constructive criticisms though,
and perhaps this was your point given my earlier outbursts in this
regard; perhaps you can help proof read for this).

Cheers,

Adam
