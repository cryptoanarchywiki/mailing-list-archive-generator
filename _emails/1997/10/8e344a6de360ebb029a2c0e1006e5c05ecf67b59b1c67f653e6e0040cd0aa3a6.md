"Today, we decided to hook up the computer that controls the power supply
of several states to the most hostile WAN in history.  OMIGOD, THERE'S
AN INSECURE POWER GENERATION CONTROL COMPUTER HOOKED UP TO THE INTERNET!
Everyone in the US, $2 please, so we can fix it."

This sounds like a bad cyberpunk novel.  Two crackers in some hotel room
in a hyper-crowded city in Japan, hacking the "power control network".
Suddenly, one of them stops and says, "Shit."  The other looks up,
startled.  The first says, "I forgot.  This is against the law."  A
pause.  Then they both start rolling around a floor covered with anti-
static bags, polystyrene, and fast-food cartons laughing until they turn
blue.

When I hear the "Law has failed to keep pace with technology" mantra, I
get the feeling that lawmakers want license to pretend that Moore's Law
applies to them, as well.  Double the amount of criminal laws and regs
every 18-24 months.

Nuke them from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
