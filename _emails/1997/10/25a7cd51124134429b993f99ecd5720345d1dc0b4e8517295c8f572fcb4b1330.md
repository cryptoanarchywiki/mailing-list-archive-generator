I'm sure a remailer could be named the Cantsin Remailer if you donated the
equipment for it.  Yes, I understand that donations to EFF are tax
deductible.  However, I don't know where EFF stands on remailers, or what
they would do with the ecash you send them.  If EFF does not want to become
involved in a remailer with you, then you still have the offer to send the
donation to EFGA if you would like.
