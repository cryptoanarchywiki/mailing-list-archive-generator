InfoWarriors around the globe have already been preparing for
'The Son of Clipper' and 'The Daughter of GAK'.

The defenders of Freeh-Dumb know that the key to totalitarian
access to communications/information is to slip in the back
door of new technolgies via those who develop and produce that 
technology.

The anti-trust actions against Intel are for the purpose of
negotiating a foothold in programmable CPU's, etc.
The anti-trust outrage against MicroSoft is meant to be a
million-dollar-a-day punishment for reneging on their deal
to provide GAK hooks in Internet Explorer 4.0.

Look for MS and Intel to string the government along in this
regard, while delaying long enough to let the Y2K problem 
force the government's hand in their desire for total control
of the Information Highway Robbery system.
The battle is for control of the New Electronic Jerusalem.

Sincerely,
Your 'other brother' Deitweler
