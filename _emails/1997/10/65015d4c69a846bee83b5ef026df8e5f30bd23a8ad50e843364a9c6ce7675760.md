The Klinton Klan has already effectively banned imported SKS ammo (7.62x29,
as I recall, given that I don't have any rifles chambering this popular
round).

 Before you rush to correct me, I _meant_ to write "7.62x39" of course.


(A round used by the Chinese, Soviet, and East Bloc nations, and roughly
equivalent to the American M-16 round, known either as the .223 or 5.56mm.
The NATO "7.62" is in a longer case length. 7.62x54, as I recall. Known in
America as .308.
