My ire at "Nobuki Nakatuji" comes less from his broken English (which is no
doubt several orders of magnitude better than my broken Japanese) than from
his repeated trollings of the list to send him money for more details.

Also, he has never engaged in any discussion, broken English or not. I have
begun to surmise a 'bot is at work.

He or she or it may not even be Japanese, of course. The hotmail account is
well-known for throwaway accounts (even remailers).

(Searches on his name reveal no Usenet posts under his name, "Nobuki
Nakatuji," and no presence on the Web save for Cypherpunks archives. The
"hotmail" domain name, and the "bd1011" adds to my suspicion that this
person is trolling. If people send him money, all the better for him. I say
burn him.)
