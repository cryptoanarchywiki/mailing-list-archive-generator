    Blanc <blancw@cnw.com> purported to expostulate:

+Since he says "we are ... dangerous ... if .... we are not scrutinized
+carefully", I interpret this to mean that he is advising and warning
+that the agency therefore *needs* to be kept under watchful
+surveillance, lest it develop to the level of its worst potential. 

  Blanc: 

  At the end of the document I repeat the quote another way. To me, 
  stating that "your" FBI is potentially the most dangerous agency, is a 
  facetious attempt on the part of F[reeh,uck] to disarm, or at least give 
  everyone the warm fuzzies, that the FBI is _not_ dangerous. backhand 
  disinformation. what he is waiting for is his straight man to say, "Oh, 
  Louie, you know that's not true; we trust you implicitely."

  --start excerpt

    Louis F]reeh,uck], did you really state this hoping everyone would 
    think you are joking? 

        "We are potentially the most dangerous agency in the 
        country if we are not scrutinized carefully."

    Louis F[reeh,uck], you obviously know that telling the truth, before 
    the truth is really the truth, disarms your opposition since they 
    can plainly see that it is not true.

  --end excerpt

  sarcasm, like revenge, is a dish best served up cold.
