Gee, Mark, I thought it was the SMTP filter that did the enforcing.  
Maybe if PGP didn't call it "CMR" but instead called it something 
neutral like the "key link field".

Let's see, your scenario involves putting super sniffers at strategic
positions throughout the net, and passing laws that not only supports
this, but makes it illegal to go around them.  I suggest that if such
laws are passed PGP's software is the least of your problems.

To make it plain, Mark, I "explain it away" this way:  fundametally, 
your scenario assumes what it is trying to prove -- you assume that 
incredibly draconian laws are in place, and then you use that 
assumption to prove that incredibly draconian laws are in place.  
This is known as "circular reasoning" -- perhaps you've heard of it?
