According to an editorial in the SF Chronicle by Edward Teller from about
a year ago, the folks in Livermore have teamed up with their counterparts
in Russia to develop just that. This is one of marvels of post-cold war
cooperation. Teller failed to understand the need for such a project. 
Clearly, the availability of non-fission (catstrophic)fusion devices
should lead to an increased market penetation of such devices. There are
few products where supply and demand are as missmatched as is the case
with H-bombs. The spot market will welcome this relief.
