Black Unicorn uses a nym to express opinions he expects his coworkers and
acquaintances would not like.  Anonymous remailers can be used for the same
purpose.  I have heard of people's posts being brought up in employment
interviews.  A rational person might want to express controversial opinions
anonymously.
