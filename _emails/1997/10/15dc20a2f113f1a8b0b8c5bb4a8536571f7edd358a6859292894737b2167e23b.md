Gosh, so I can just remove that packet and all my mail will bounce. What
fun. This seems to be one of the mantras which pro-PGP folks are chanting: 
'But there are easy ways to work around it, just modify your copy of PGP
and it will all work fine'. Indeed there are; I have no doubt that there
is no way that anyone could entirely prevent me from communicating privately
with a few people. But what happens when I want to check whether the local
Blockbuster have a copy of 'Debbie does Fort Meade'; will they have modified
their software so I can send mail to them without GMR? Of course not. So
99.9% of my mail will still be visible to the government.

*IT'S NOT THE MULTIPLE RECIPIENTS THAT ARE THE PROBLEM, IT'S BUILDING THE
'MANDATORY VOLUNTARY' MULTIPLE ENCRYPTION INTO EVERY COPY OF PGP WHICH IS
THE PROBLEM* This is the other mantra that PGP supporters chant 'Oh, but
it could all be done with PGP 2.6.2 and a few scripts'. Of course it could,
but only a few people would choose to use those filters. If the government
were to set up SMTP enforcers in various choke-points around the Net (and
I'm aware of the performance issues) then anyone using PGP would have to
encrypt to the 'voluntary' FBI key or lose their mail. The Feds aren't
going to issue every PGP user with scripts to do it, but if you build this
facility into the software they can use it.

Duh, of course they won't. But that email will go out over a TCP link to
the SMTP port, where it can be checked on route by sniffers or proxies.
How did the Chinese and Singaporeans restrict Net access? By blocking
connections in the routers and Web proxies. This is the way to do it, not
to force everyone to run an SMTP enforcer on their personal machine.

>a bizarre idea.

Yes, I must be, mustn't I. I mean, the Feds would never pass a law 
mandating that all Internet providers must provide SMTP proxies which 
enforce the GMR and block other SMTP connections; after all, they never 
passed a law mandating that telephone companies must provide wiretap
access. Oh, they did, didn't they?

>If the only
>way the government can enforce GAK is by making it illegal for people to
>receive email through paths which don't pass through government filters
>we can all rest easy, because it will never happen.

Yes, which is why they won't do it that way. In my last job, any SMTP
access from my machine to any other on the Net was automatically routed
to our local SMTP server which acted as a proxy. Why can't the Feds do
this on the US Internet?

>Or superencrypt to the real end user, like you suggested in your scheme.
>Why is this OK as a privacy workaround for your idea but it doesn't
>count for PGP?

Firstly, that's not a "privacy workaround" in my system, it's to prevent
traffic analysis. Secondly, again it's a workaround which will only be
available to a small number of people. 

>Ignoring all the considerations above about what a stupid idea this is,
>the fact is that a simple filter like this is incredibly easy to write.

As I said before, the SMTP filter is not the evil aspect of your design,
it's the enforced encryption to multiple recipients.

I just have. Now try to explain it away.
