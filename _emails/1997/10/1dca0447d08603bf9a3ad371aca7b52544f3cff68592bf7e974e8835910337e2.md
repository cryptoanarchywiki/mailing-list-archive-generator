    like I have said again and again: Gate$ has the basic TS
    trait of "the rules dont apply to me" in spades.  lawyers
    will add their wildest dreams to contracts; Gate$ carried
    the responsibility to exercise common sense --he did not.
    his overwhelming drive: "veni, vidi, vici" is all consuming.
    his temper tantrums are legendary: classic TS.

    yes, the restriction on planned contacts with the government
    is illegal: it constitutes "obstruction of justice" -in
    fact, I would say it is probably the most prima facie case
    of it I have ever seen. it is a slap in the face to our
    basic concept of fairness and the rule of law.

    I vote that the DOJ initiate the criminal phase of the
    Sherman and Clayton acts.  I have always accused Gate$ of
    having lower morals, and dirtier hands, than Cornelius
    Vanderbilt or Jay Gould.

    the argument that dismembering M$ will throw the computer
    industry into total disarray is bullshit.  No, it will
    permit other operating systems and software to enter the
    market. the divested software components can be distributed
    in much the same way the seven Baby Bells were value and
    AT&T stock was split with each AT&T share being worth so
    many of each component and the shareholders could pick.

    Meanwhile, with Gate$, "to heck with Janet Reno" Ballmer,
    and their lawyers in federal prison where they are
    prohibited from running a business, the software industry
    might return to some well needed diversity since Gate$ will
    not be able to swing his mighty hatchet.
