every day I think, 'things can't possibly get any stupider'.  and
invariably, I am proven wrong.

from CNET: http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,15721,00.html

Next year's Pentium II computers will be subject to
export controls if a bill pending in Congress passes.
It's expected to come up in the House today. 

Under an amendment to the 1998 Defense
Authorization bill, computer makers shipping machines
that can perform 2,000 million theoretical operations
per second (MTOPS) or more to developing nations
will have to apply to the Commerce Department for an
export license. 

...

Lofgren explained that about the only way to stop the
provision from becoming law at this point would be a
presidential veto, because the sprawling piece of
legislation has already been approved in substance by
the House and Senate.

etc., etc., etc.


sheesh...
