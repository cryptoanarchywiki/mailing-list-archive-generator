S-box structure is one of the critical issues in designing
Feistel-type networks; if you understand the mathematics
very very well, you can do it yourself, and if you don't,
then you don't understand it well enough to be sure
the S-boxes are secure enough, and thus you shouldn't
be selling it to customers.

An advantage of GOST for the Soviets was that they could 
use the same code, with different sets of S-boxes for the
military, civilian government, and other applications,
and the KGB could easily read things they wanted easily read
but the things that needed to be harder to read were hard.
