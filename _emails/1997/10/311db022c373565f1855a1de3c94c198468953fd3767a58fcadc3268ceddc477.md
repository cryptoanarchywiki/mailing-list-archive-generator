Correction: Cole Harbor High School is in Nova Scotia. 

Canada ia not perfect, no country is, but men and women typically feel
safe enought to walk the streets alone at night.

Racial hatred is not accepted in the communities at large, nor is
wife-beating. I never encountered youth gangs on the subways of
Montreal this summer.

The fact that you list all the newsworthy examples of teen violence speaks
volumes onto itself. 

The typically Canadian gun owner uses it for one of two purposes; the
most common usage is 1) sport hunting 2) target shooting - I have used a
gun many times, never towards a living being.
