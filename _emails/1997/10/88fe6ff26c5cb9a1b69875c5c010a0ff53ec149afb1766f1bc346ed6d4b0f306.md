  A few days after the episode above, some of the employees were
giving Alan shit for sleeping on the nightshift, and thus not
being available to help those who came in to the Drop-In Center.
  Alan replied that, as a Warlock, he was not sleeping, but was
in a very deep state of meditation, able to hear a pin drop,
anywhere in the building.
  Sure enough, a couple days later, Alan was in his deep state
of meditation when someone came in and stole the TV set which
was sitting a few feet from his head.

>From News of the Weird:
* In January, Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda of India told a
meeting of government employees in Bangalore that, in contrast
with his image of laziness, he is actually a workaholic.  The various
photographs of him dozing off during official meetings are not
accurate, he said.  "Most of the time I am in deep thought about
various welfare programs for the people." 

  Right. That would account for the holes in his arm...
