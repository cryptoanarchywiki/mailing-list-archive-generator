That was the sound of me eating crow.
Although I am a closet reader of the True Story of the Internet series
I am generally perturbed by the many of the inane Truthmonger posts to
the list. I had decided several days ago to make a small apology to
Truthmonger for some of my more emotional attacks on him (or her) but
I put it off and put it off. I decided not to put it off after reading
the following:
Six wrote:
> Bonus Question: "Who is TruthMonger #1?"
> Bonus Answer: "He's Randall Farmer's best friend."

That is _exactly_ what I thought when I read Randalls whining post
about how Truthmongers rudeness might necessitate Randall instituting
security and identity procedures that would enable others to verify
whether a digitally signed message was indeed from himself. When I saw
Tokoyo Rose echoing my thoughts then I thought I should take the trouble
to point out what I myself learned from Truthmonger. [Although I am not
certain if it is the same one.]
I made the mistake of informing several people that the exercise that
was suggested in Epiloge 5? of Infowar was bullshit but when I tried
it it spit out my secret key like a hot damn much to my surprise.
So I owe Truthmonger an apology but it will not be a public one.
[Very few of you would know me anyway since I am mostly a list lurker.]
The reason I will not make a public apology is because I also had
PGP spit out the secret keys of my boss and coworkers. Although I am
not a bad person in general possession of these keys is making me
begin to think like Truthmonger. I will probably just test whether
I can indeed password break them and use them to decipher a few
files and then erase my copy of them. [Maybe.]
[Maybe I should make my .sig line "Beware of Truthmonger inside!"]

I did a search for the post that Tokoyo Rose talked about Truthmongers
nephew adding things to Truthmongers email and found:
>   Also, as a 'teaser', I would like to announce to one and all that
> the quickly closing saga of 'InfoWar' will include an epilogue
> chapter titled, "I Broke PGP," written by myself.
>   Believe it or not, I speak the truth, although not in a way that
> it direct and obvious.
>  If you think I am bullshiting, then stop washing your asshole,
> starting today, because if you can show me I am wrong, I will kiss
> your ugly, hairy ass.
>
> Love and Kisses,
> TruthMangler

After looking at other posts that have Truthmangler in them instead
of Truthmonger I think that it might be a sign that the nephew is
messing with them since they seem to have things inserted in them
which appear to come more from a childs mind than Truthmongers.
[If that is possible.] (;>)
I would be interested in finding out if other people have been able 
to get secret keys using the method described in the Infowar book.
We are using PGP 2.6.3i. I wonder about other versions.
