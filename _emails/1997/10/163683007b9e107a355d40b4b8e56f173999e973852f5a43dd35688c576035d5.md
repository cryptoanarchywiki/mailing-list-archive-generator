A little confused here.  Let's call the older man "Victor" and his
fifteen year old friend "Harold".  Neither of them were murdered,
right?  Let's call the murder victim "Norbert".

"Harold" refused to rat out "Victor" and now the police are charging
"Harold" with the murder of "Norbert".

What is the relationship between "Harold" and "Norbert"?  You say
there is no direct evidence connecting them.  What evidence does
connect them?  Did they at least know each other?

While "Harold" may not be guilty of the murder, if he did kill
"Norbert" then he should probably be treated as a murderer.  While the
police should not harrass gays, such harrassment does not seem to make
a good excuse for murdering an unrelated completely innocent third
party.
