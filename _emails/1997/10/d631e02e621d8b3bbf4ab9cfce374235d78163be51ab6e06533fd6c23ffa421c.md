Good luck, but be aware that you won't get much free analysis.  In
general, algorithms that aren't published don't get looked at very
carefully (mostly because there's no real upside in doing so--at least
if the algorithm is published you can get a paper out of a break).

You might have more luck if you posted the algorthm (not in source
code, but in a mathematical description) along with a comprehensive
analysis of its security against existing attacks.  (There is a lot
of published research on the analysis of stream ciphers, although the
field is much less well-studied than block cipher analysis.)  Good
security arguments, proofs even, will make more people interested.

Cheers,
Bruce
