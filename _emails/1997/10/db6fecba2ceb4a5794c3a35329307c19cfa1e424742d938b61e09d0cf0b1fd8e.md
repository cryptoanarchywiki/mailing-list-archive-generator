There were three lists.  The unfiltered list did not go through the
moderator's hands in any way and continued to received all messages
(which is how unfiltered subscribers found out about the problem).
The filtered list had the posts approved by the moderated.  Then there
was supposed to be a "flames" list where the moderator sent posts he
had rejected.  In theory, the moderated+flames lists should have the
same contents as the unfiltered list.  Here is the original statement
by the moderator laying out his policy:

Here is a message from a pseudonymous poster laying out what actually
happened.  Many list members may not have seen this message, unless they
were subscribed to the unfiltered list.

and here is a letter to him from the moderator, confirming this fact:

In sum, no messages were filtered from the unfiltered list, which
is how cypherpunks who avoided moderation learned of the situation.
The messages were eliminated from the regular (moderated) list, but they
were not sent to the "flames" list, contrary to the stated policies.
No hint was given to the subscribers to the moderated list, which was
the majority, that this was being done.  Messages referring to these
facts were also filtered.  A sad episode indeed.
