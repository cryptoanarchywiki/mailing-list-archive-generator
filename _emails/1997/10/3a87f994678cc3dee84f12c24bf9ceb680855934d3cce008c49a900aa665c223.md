That's true.  You asked for a better definition of "basis".  I was 
trying to do that without writing a textbook, though.

No.  A *set* of vectors.  And I presumed you already knew what a
vector was, and a slight reminder would be all that was necessary.. 
if you aren't at least somewhat familiar with the ideas of sets and
vectors, it would be somewhat difficult for you to follow the rest of 
what I wrote, I grant.

Yes, though you have to understand that "0" is the zero *vector*  -- 
the sum of vectors is always another vector.

I was defining "linear independence", a basic concept needed to 
understand the notion of a basis.

Nope.  It may be the zero vector vs zero scalar confusion.  Consider
the two linerarly *dependent* vectors in 2-space: (1,0), (2,0), and
the set {2,-1} of non-zero scalars: 2*(1,0) + -1*(2,0) = (0,0). 

Contrast with the two linearly *independent* vectors (1,0), (0,2).  
There is *no* set of scalars {c1,c2}, with at least 1 of ci != 0, such that 
c1*(1,0) + c2*(0,2) == (0,0).  This is obvious:

c1*(1,0) + c2*(0,2) = (c1,2*c2), which obviously cannot be (0,0) if 
either c1 or c2 is non-zero.

If you like.  I am defining the word "span", however, because that is 
the common terminology.

Sorry.  I really thought the notion of a "linear combination" would be
common knowledge.  You can check your dictionary.

No, in fact it's not.  There is nothing original in the definition -- 
I'm just parroting what I learned 20 years ago.

That's not what I said, though.

Oh Jeez.  Vectors.  Note that the last sentence defines "finite 
dimensioned", not "basis".

I paraphrased material from "Calculus of Vector Functions", 3rd
edition, by Williamson, Crowell, and Trotter and "Linear Algebra", by
Hoffman and Kunze.  These are both really old texts, but any book on
linear algebra will cover the same material.

Nope.  The definition is "a basis for V is a linearly independent set
of vectors in V that spans V." I defined "linearly independent" and
"span" without using the word "basis", or even the idea of a "basis".  
It is not a circular definition.

At this point, it is clear that I should simply refer you to an
elementary linear algebra text.  I will just repeat that, for those
that are familiar with linear algebra, the analogical use of "orthogonal"
in language design is pretty intuitive.  If you don't have the
background you may not have the intuition, and discussion on this list
probably isn't the best way to build it.
