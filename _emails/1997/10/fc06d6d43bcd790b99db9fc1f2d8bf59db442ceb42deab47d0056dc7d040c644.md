What are you trying to accomplish?  Having a non-obvious place
to store passwords?  After all, your suggestion is really equivalent
to a bunch of numbers stored in a file.

What has usefully been done is to take numbers and hide them as
low-order bits in a graphic file, with various implementations
getting fancy about either just sticking them there or looking
at the palette values from the picture and finding something
visually better matching.
				Thanks!
