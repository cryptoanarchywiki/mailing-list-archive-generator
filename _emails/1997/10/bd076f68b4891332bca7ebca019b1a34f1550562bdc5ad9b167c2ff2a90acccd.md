This remailer-op, while not previously aware of the case, is well-aware of
that provision of the CDA, but has not yet had the need or opportunity to
use it as a legal defense. The reference is Public Law 104-104, Title V,
Subtitle A, Sec. 502 as it amends (47 U.S.C. 223). The text of this law is
available on-line at:

        http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.652.ENR:

My interpretation of this is: Anonymous remailers are internet service
providers.
