Monty, without a doubt that is the stupidest thing you have ever said on
this list.

If a company makes your employment contingent on something you don't like,
change jobs. DON'T need laws, don't want laws that get involved in this.
This is *STRICTLY* a civil contract issue between the two parties, PERIOD.

Why is it that so many people start discussions regarding social issues and
then meander into government issues, or visa versa, without ANY recognition
of their schizophrenia?

Personaly, I blame it on spin doctors like yourself.

At least I have the satisfaction knowing that in no way am I contributing to
putting food on your table, making your car payments, or paying off your drug
dealer...
