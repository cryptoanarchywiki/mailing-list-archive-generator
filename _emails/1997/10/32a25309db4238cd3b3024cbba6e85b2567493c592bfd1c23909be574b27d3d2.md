Check out http://www.kidsonline.org/  -- it's a hoot. Praises the CDA as a
"well-intentioned effort to protect children." Grew out of the White
House's kickoff Censorware Summit in July; Clinton is expected to speak at
this one. Scheduled for Dec 1-3 here in DC. Chaired by former Clinton
campaign official and former FTC "protect the children" Commissioner
Christine Varney. (This is not to criticize Varney; I rather like her
personally, but politically, well...)

The Censorware Summit is organized largely by industy groups -- America
Online initially took the lead role -- and sympathetic advocacy groups.
Donna Rice-Hughes (yes that Donna Rice) is heavily involved, as operations
co-chair or something (I forget her real title). Sydney Rubin
(syd@kidsonline.org), a public relations rep for CyberPatrol, is handling
media registration. The Center for Democracy and Technology, which runs the
pro-censorware netparents.org site, is hosting the kidsonline.org site.

Following is a quote from the web site. Note it talks about how we need
stricter enforcement of obscenity laws -- one of the worst ideas I've heard
in a while. Remember Robert Thomas -- why should S.F. or NYC be subject to
the "community standards" of Tennessee? *sigh*

Fortunately there's a coalition forming to oppose this. That is,
emphasizing the free speech implications of rating and filtering proposals.
I understand details will be made public soon. As I said:
