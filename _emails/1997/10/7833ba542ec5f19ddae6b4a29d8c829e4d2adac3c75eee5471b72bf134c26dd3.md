Of course not:

 -   it provides even more non-covered traffic for Mallet to analyze

 -   it proves that the remailer is keeping long-term records of its
     activity, further prompting Mallet to use rubber-hose crypto or
     a covert break-in to recover the data.

A commercial remailers should keep no records and this means that each
submission must include some form of token for immediate payment of access
fees. Further, a secure remailer should NEVER send traffic to a subscriber
as the result of anything other than normal traffic handling.
