+
+Actually I think you are the spoiled brat. If you had any real 
+experience of computer security you would know who I am 
+and who I work with.
+
    oh, my!  a self-righteous, ostentatious, gratuitous, chest thumper.
    maybe even a national hero! "Pompous in high presumption" (Chaucer)

    has your press relations officer given your home town newspaper
    an exclusive broadside to make your mum proud?

    probably still looking for his horse...

+One of the principles of propaganda is reflection - poor 
+propagandists accuse others of their own faults. My guess
+is that Attila is a sixteen year old schoolkid who thinks that
+downloading PGP and reading Bruce's book makes him a 
+security expert.

    the truth would surprise you.
    those who know had a need to know; the rest are irrelevant. 

+The real complacent folk are the ones that put their trust in 
+cargo cult readings of Bill Morris.

    one of Sir Winston Churchill's great lines obviously applies:
    
      "[Hallam-Baker] has the gift on compressing the largest 
        amount of words into the smallest amount of thoughts."
