Sure.  Please call.  Your CEO called me on Monday, and he tried to tell me
that it wasn't key escrow because you weren't saving copies of any keys.
If you're just going to call to split those sorts of hairs, don't bother.
I'm interested in hearing how your key escrow system works; I've already
been told why you put it in.
