Dan,
  I just read the headers on the previous message, and boy, do I feel
like a fucking idiot. It was a forgery!
  Boy, sometimes I'm just dumber than a sackful of hammers.

  Hold on, while I check the headers on _this_ message.

  Damn! This one's a forgery, too.
  Now I feel really, really, stupid..._writing_ a forged message.

  I'm going to go sit in a corner, and hit my dick with a hammer.
