You might want to direct your comments to the author of this spammage,
Gary L. Burnore <gburnore@databasix.com>, CEO of DataBasix, who still 
appears to be on a vendetta against the anonymous remailers.  This
particular spam campaign appears to be designed to accomplish two things:

1.)  Get people upset at the anonymous remailers by posting this spam
     through them, and;

2.)  Saturate the news search engines with matches on his name and that
     of his company so that any search on these words yields a vast
     majority of false matches.

Just look at some of the Subject: lines he's posted over just the past
few days:

comprehensive in his judgment, that he can be trusted with the power to
tell others:  'You shall not express yourself thus, you shall not
describe your own experiences; or depict the fantasies which your mind
has created; or laugh at what others set up as respectable; or question
old beliefs; or contradict the dogmas of the church, of our society, our
economic systems, and our political orthodoxy.'"
