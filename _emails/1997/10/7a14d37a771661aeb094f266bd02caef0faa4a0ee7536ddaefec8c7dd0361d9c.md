Yes, I find it particularly interesting that the CFV states only that "The
newsgroup is robomoderated to eliminate crossposts and advertisements
only" but does not mention that the robomoderation requires a repliable
(i.e., non-anonymous) e-mail address. (This IS mentioned for the voting
procedure, but not for the group itself. 

Also, in <6203tu$kuj@server2.mich.com>, the proponent for comp.org.cauce
states, "The CFV says people must return an e-mail sent to the address
from which they make the post," which, as near as I can tell, is a lie or
error; I got the ballot from my local server (<876781691.12806@isc.org>)
and it says no such thing, only that it is robomoderated. "Robomoderated"
does not imply that you "must return an e-mail sent to the address from
which [you] make the post". Maybe it says that in the last RFD, but not in
the CFV. 

At any rate, if for some reason this CFV is approved, I will post
something to comp.org.cauce with the remailer, and when the reply comes
back (yes, the return address is valid), I'll reply to it, so cracker will
be able to post there, until somebody decides, using their "discretion",
to ban posts from the remailer address.

If it were comp.org.cauce.announce, I really wouldn't give a shit about
what the moderation policy is, but it's represented as a group where
"opinions contrary to those of CAUCE are solicited and welcomed," and I
don't have too much confidence that this will be the case.

Spam sucks but censorship is worse.
