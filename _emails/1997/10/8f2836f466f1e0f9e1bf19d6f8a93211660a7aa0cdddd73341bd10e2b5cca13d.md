This is true, NYC is an SC. My pinko nose is barely above the 
surface, for it's a hump treading the globe's shipped in effluvia with 
concrete boots made of the NIMBYs' unpaid share. And you never
get used to it, for sure the waves caused by tens of thousands 
of NIMBYs cannonballing in for X-rated sin lacking IMBY.
