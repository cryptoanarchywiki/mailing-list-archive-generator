#Subject: North CA cops skip preliminaries, get straight to torture

CBS news tonight showed cops in a northern CA town use swabs to apply
"pepper spray" directly to the eyes of demonstrators in some Congressman's
office. One cop administered headlocks, another pried eyelids open and a
third administered discipline.

That's the ticket. Skip the judge and jury, just let the
cops torture the perps.  Why stop at pepper spray?  Why not bamboo shoots?
Electric shocks to the genitals?  We must have order.

Glad none of those human-rights protestors in DC will care.  And none of
those left-wing-commie-pinko llllliberals. And none of those right-wing
Christians.
