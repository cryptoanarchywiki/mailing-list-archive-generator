Nifty comment by Michael McMain on JavaLobbyCafe@iceworld.org

--------------------------

A friend at work made an interesting point about MS's claim that IE4 is
simply an OS extension and not an application.  All the DA has to do is
turn on a Power Mac, start IE4, turn to MS and say "So what other parts
of your OS run on the Macintosh exactly?".
