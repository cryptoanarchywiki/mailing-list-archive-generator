Although guns are obviously designed for killing things, this does not
mean that they will be used.  This can be seen from the statistics.
There are far fewer murders than there are guns.  Almost all of them
are never used for killing someone.

You are also not considering the case where one person has a gun and
another does not.  The situation is more stable if both people are
armed.  (And don't claim you are talking about disarming a whole
society.  You aren't, just part of it.)

Depends who they are.  Bet the Dutch resistance made good use of their
weaponry, eh?

>In the US, where guns are tradition and part of the American way,

This is simply untrue.  TV and movies are not the best way to form an
understanding of another country.

I read recently that 9000 people a year die in the United States from
food poisoning.  This should be almost entirely preventable.  Why
isn't this a big political issue?  Could it be that the people pushing
gun control do not have entirely pure motives?

Be aware that the gun control lobby has often used misleading
statistics.  For instance, you will hear a lot about "handgun deaths".
It turns out that most of these are suicides.  While undesirable, most
people perceive a difference between somebody killing themselves and a
nutcase doing his thing at a school.
