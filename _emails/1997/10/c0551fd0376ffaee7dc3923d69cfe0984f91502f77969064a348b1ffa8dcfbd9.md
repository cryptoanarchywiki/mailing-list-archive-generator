This is quite silly argument David,

Do all E-Mail vendors need to be cryptologist?? Do all cryptologist need
to be application vendors?? Obviously not. PGP is a tool much like a
database is. The majority of vendors who develop apps that require a
database do not go out and write their own, rather they use a database
engine that is suited to their needs. Betreve doesn't try to develop every
application that may use a database, instead they sell the database engine
and let the application developers make the apps. The same is true for
E-Mail vendors, they integrate PGP into their products. No need for PGP
Inc, to develop their own E-Mail product.

FWIW: I am quite confedent that if Phil wished to write an
E-Mail/NewsReader he is quite capable of producing a better product than
the peice of crap N$ has on the market.
