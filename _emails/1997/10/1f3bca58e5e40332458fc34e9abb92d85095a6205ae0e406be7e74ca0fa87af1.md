Actually, it's snooping of messages in transit on a network OWNED BY 
THE COMPANY.

Given the frequency of "I've forgotten my password" incidents at
company help desks, widespread use of cryptography would cause this to
become *the* prime cause of lost data.  As has been pointed out, 
email is actually very reliable.  Hard disks are very reliable, tapes 
are very reliable.  Loss of data through these media has become very 
rare, and with intelligent practice, non-existent for all practical 
purposes.

This is a bad argument for you to use.  From a privacy perspective,
didn't people send all kinds of very private stuff on *paper* and
through *mailboxes* just a few short years ago?  How did they survive 
without strong encryption?!  "Geez.  Let's get real here."

The physical mail analogy to PGP's implementation of CMR is as 
follows:  Company policy is that it does not accept private pmail for 
individuals.  All mail for individuals must be addressed

XYZ Company
attn: Indi Vidual
Address1
Address2

Mail addressed like this:

Indi Vidual
Address1
Address2

will be returned, because the company doesn't accept private mail.  
Company mail is to be used for company business.  You don't receive 
Playboy at work, you receive it at home.
