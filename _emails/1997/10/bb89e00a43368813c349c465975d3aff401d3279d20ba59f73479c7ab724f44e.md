But what are the boundaries? How do you tell when a particular action has
crossed them?

They don't? What if the resource is a requirement for a normal life?
Is simple ownership a license to steal or abuse? How do you even describe
them in a general sense? What if the owner of a resource decides to change
the fair use policy? Shouldn't the user have a say in what those conditions
are? Is simply agreeing to be a user of a resource license for the owner to
use that dependency to manipulate the user?

No, your answers are better than the other persons but not by much.
