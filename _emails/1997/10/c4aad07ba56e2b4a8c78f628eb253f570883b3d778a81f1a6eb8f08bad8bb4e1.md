Keep in mind that this is the 'PGP for Business'. Companies often 
operate on the principle that email that's sent and received from 
their machines is the company's, not the employee's. This is actually 
reasonable business practice. Specially when encryption enters the 
picture. The employee could walk under a bus, and leave some vital 
but encrypted emails in his mailbox. This could be a real problem for 
corporations.

Individuals should of course stay as far away from something like 
this as possible.
