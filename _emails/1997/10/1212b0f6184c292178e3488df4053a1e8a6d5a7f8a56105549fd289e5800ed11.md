Or use something like anonymous broadcast.  Send (fixed sized, constant
rate) packets continuously around a fixed set of remailers.  Messages may
or may not be inserted into these packets, and with encryption it is
impossible to tell which node inserted a message (and only until the
packet completed the circuit could you tell - inside the machine
originating the broadcast).  Messages would be resent through the set of
remailers, and could be PK encrypted to one of the other nodes.  With the
broadcast being anonymous, the reciever within the set cannot know who it
came from (and theoretically because it is encrypted, no one could know
who it is to except the sender, and you can do something to create
anonymous target packets). 

You would still need some mixing for low usage times (or wait for N
messages and circulate a control "forward now" message, so that 10
messages come in sequentially and are held, and then at an even interval,
10 messages go out from random nodes.
