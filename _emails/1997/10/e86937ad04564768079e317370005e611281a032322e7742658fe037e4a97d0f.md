He's no anarcho-cypherpunk:   he and his father just contributed a great
amount of money to support a gun-law initiative which would place all sorts
of requirements on gun-owners (mandatory licensing, mandatory training,
mandatory gun-locks, and many privacy-intrusive reductions of personal
authority, etc.) in Washington state.

I don't precisely know where he stands regarding crypto, but I know that he
puts business requirements and customer acceptance above the arguments of
GAK advocates, as do the VIPs who work in encryption and who totally reject
the idea of Big Brother.
