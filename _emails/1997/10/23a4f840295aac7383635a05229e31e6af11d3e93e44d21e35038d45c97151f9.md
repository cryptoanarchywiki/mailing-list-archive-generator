Oh, I get it.  Thanks.

And now I get why people want to assign passwords to each digit.
Mallory has no way of knowing all the mappings, even when one is
revealed.

Just to get a feel for what this looks like, a table like this one
could be exchanged in advance of each telephone call.  (Nothing here
is my invention, of course.)  The columns are used once successively
for each digit.

This has about 85 bits of entropy assuming the words are randomly
selected from a pool of 20,000.  As Mallory only gets one try, those
are very good odds.  This is completely practical and secure because
the table is easy to generate and exchange.

(Not that an in-band method wouldn't be way cool!)
