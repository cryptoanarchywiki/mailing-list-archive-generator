I thought when Phil showed me the corporate access option that the user had
the ability to remove that crypto-recipient by double clicking on it in the
window which pops up listing all crypto-recipients.  I may have been wrong.

I agree with you that the danger is in allowing the gov't to claim that
industry accepts GAK.  If this product were released with a sticker on
every copy to the effect that we citizens have always had a right to
attempt to keep a secret from gov't via crypto, then I'd feel better.

Meanwhile, aren't we overlooking the real issue here: that there are
apparently companies obnoxious enough to tell you you are not allowed to
send mail they can't read?  Little Brother may be as bad as Big Brother.
