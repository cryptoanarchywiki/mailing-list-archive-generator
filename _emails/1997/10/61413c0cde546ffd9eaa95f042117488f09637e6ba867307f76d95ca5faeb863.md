THE V CHIP, COMING TO A COMPUTER NEAR YOU

Time Magazine
November 3, 1997
Page 36

If you hated the idea of a V chip in your television,
wait until you hear that the government wants to
install one in your computer. TIME has learned that
the FCC has proposed that new PCs be outfitted with a
V chip to filter out video violence and sex. Still
unclear is what Net broadcasts could be affected. The
idea alarms free-speech advocates, who wonder why
Americans need a Net-nanny. "What you get is a
devolution of the First Amendment," argues lawyer Bob
Corn-Revere. FCC chairman REED HUNDT says the
high-tech industry can "be part of the process" as the
agency sets rules. There's a low-tech alternative: the
off switch.
