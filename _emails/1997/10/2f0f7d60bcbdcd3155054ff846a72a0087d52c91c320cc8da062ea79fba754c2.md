 I live in the state of Vermont, where we have more guns per household
than most of the states in the US. We are one of the only (if not
*the* only) states in the Union that permits concealed carry without
requiring a permit (with the not surprising exceptions of USG
buildings and schools). Our record high murder year was a few years
ago, twenty three murders (that high because we had a woman go crazy
at the Eveready plant in Bennington and killed five people in one
sitting) in more recent years the figure generally stays under ten per
year ...three years ago the figure was five and only one of them was
with a gun ... a shotgun, not a handgun. We go where we please with
little fear as well; It has to do with a frame of mind, a set of
values, not with a lack of availability or opportunity.

  There is something to be said for living in a place where a man can
come right down off the hills during deer season and walk into a
liquor store with a shotgun to buy a bottle of hooch without drawing a
SWAT team! Try that in NYC or Toronto!
