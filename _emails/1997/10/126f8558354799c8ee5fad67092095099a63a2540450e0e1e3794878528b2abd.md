Maybe in retrospect I was just tugging your leash a bit, for which I 
apologise.

I agree, in principle there are few entities which are more aptly 
placed than the power utilities to provide a roots to leaves high-
capacity network into your home. Telephone companies could do it, 
although the very final stage in the link (twisted copper) is a 
capacitive load, and therefore not very well suited to high 
frequencies. Power wires, on the other hand, would exhibit better 
properties and are universally installed. The solution, however, must 
be a fibre/copper hybrid. The trick will be getting the bridges 
between fibre/copper and copper/copper (across the step-downs) cheap 
and reliable enough. This is probably the breakthrough.

The post from Judith Lewis seems to hint at about 0.5MB/s. Good 
enough for your average Joe.
 
Sorry for the obtuseness of my reply.
