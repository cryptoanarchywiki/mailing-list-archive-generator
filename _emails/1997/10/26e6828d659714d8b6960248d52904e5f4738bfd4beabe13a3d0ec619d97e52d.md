It is no longer in transit for the purposes of encryption when you
have decrypted it.  At that point you can store it in unencrypted
form, or in encrypted form with recovery information.

One week would cover it mostly?

You can even escrow the communications-only keys if you're really
bothered about people going away for a week and forgetting their
password on return with a few encrypted messages queued up.  Even that
is much better than CMR.

You might want to implement a evenings hacking's worth of PFS
transport level security if you were going to do that to reduce the
risk.

Sure, I can agree with that.

The point of CDR is to make sure the attacker has to attack the
endpoints to get plaintext.  The danger with CMR is that it includes
the recovery information in the message.
