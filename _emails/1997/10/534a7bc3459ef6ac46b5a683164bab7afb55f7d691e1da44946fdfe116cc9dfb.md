>    
>    House Speaker Newt Gingrich has a proposal that may please everyone:
>    Do some of each.
>    
>    Gingrich, who appeared before the House Budget Committee on Thursday,
>    said he favors a budget policy that produces surpluses and tax cuts
>    every year, even during the next recession.
>    
>     "We should sustain ... the commitment to get to a balancedbudget and

>    Of course, no surpluses have actually materialized yet, so it may be a

>    year-end deficit of $20 billion, the smallest since 1974.
>    
>    White House budget chief Franklin Raines has urged a cautious
>    approach, with no new spending until projected surpluses actually

>    
>    Rep. John Kasich, the Ohio Republican who heads the House Budget
>    Committee, also has said lawmakers should hold off on any new tax cuts
>    or new spending until the budget is actually balanced.

>    In a related development, President Bill Clinton has signed
