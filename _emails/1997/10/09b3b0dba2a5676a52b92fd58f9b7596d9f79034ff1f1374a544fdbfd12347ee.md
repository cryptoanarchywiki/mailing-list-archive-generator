Yes, but as Adam says, the average Mr. Windows can not. In any case,
this is not a narrow technical argument. Of course any system with
multiple recipients can be turned into GAKware. The point is that we
don't want to make it ANY easier for anyone to do so.

Again, as Adam says, how long would it take for a government to
introduce legislation making this mandatory once PGP 5.5-type systems
took off? Or, more insiduously, using its purchasing power - "Federal
agencies will only buy CAK-enabled systems" - to ensure the vast
majority of systems did so.

Can I take this one up ;-) The point is, with *communication* keys,
corporations will have full access to the plaintext because it will be
decrypted by the recipient as soon as it arrives. I appreciate your
point about corporations being able to read *their* documents - although
doing so by snooping, without the sender's knowledge, is rather
unethical to say the least - but I don't think they have the right to
snoop on all *incoming* communications, whoever they may be from. This
is the really scary part of PGP 5.5...

...because PGP 2.6.x does not include an SMTP automatic snooping agent.

Absolutely. Can we start with Adam and William's proposal that we should
have three separate types of key: communication, signature, and storage.
This would be very simple to implement; probably the easiest and most
backward-compatible way would be to define a new packet type specifying
a key's usage.

Absolutely. I can see the point, and appreciate the difficulties faced
by PGP Inc., in most of the CAK features of PGP 5.5. But I just can
*not* see how the twisted idea of the SMTP snooper ever came about.

Ian.
