All OSes have a form of self modifying code which fetches programs (as
data) from disk and then executes them (as programs) in memory.  They need
a way to flush the data cache so the instruction cache can read it.

The place where it becomes expensive in modern processors is when the
processor has seen a word as an instruction, and then you want to change it
and have the new value again interpreted as an instruction.  The way to
"legitimately" do this varies by processor.  IBM mainframes detect it
automagically and "do the right thing".  SPARCs require a special "flush"
instruction to clean out the processor I-cache/pipeline.
