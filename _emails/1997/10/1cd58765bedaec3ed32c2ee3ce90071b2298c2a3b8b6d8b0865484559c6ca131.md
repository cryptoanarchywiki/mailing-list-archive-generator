You're ignoring the fact that the legislative and the judicial are just two 
different horns on the same beast.  "Please impale me with the kinder, 
gentler horn," is what you're saying.

Let's face it.  This "challenge it and get a legal precedent" approach has 
done absolutely nothing to stop America, formerly one of the freest 
countries on earth, from slowly devolving into a socialist police state.

That's why I say fuck the lawyers, and fuck the legislators, too.  If a 
roomful of morons are writing up ludicrous rules and you're gullible enough 
to listen to them, then who's the real moron?

Ignore them.  Set a precedent in life.  I'm suggesting active civil 
disobedience by every thinking person in this country.  I'm not saying blow 
up a federal building or any other such nonsense.  Be responsible for your 
actions, but act!  And act intelligently...
