 ANNOUNCEMENT: Cyber Promotions is SELLING OFF ITS OWN MAILING LIST!
 
 For the first time, you can own Cyber Promotions proprietary list of 2.9 million
 email addresses.  This is the same list to which Cyber has sent its e-Mags and
 exclusives.  This list has never been sold before!  You can take advantage of
 Cyber Promotions hard work since 1994.  Cyber has painstakingly collected these
 email addresses from the following sources...
 
 * Online classified advertisements
 * Subscribe requests
 * Autoresponder requests
 * FreeResponder owners
 * FreeRelay recipients
 * Online business-related profiles
 * Web visitors
 * Internic records
 * Web mall advertisers
 * ... and much more!
 
 Since many of the people in this database have been on this exclusive list for
 over 6 months, they have had many opportunities to unsubscribe.  This list only
 includes people who have not requested removal.  Very few of these email
 addresses are available from other sources.  You can use this list over and
 over again.  You stand to make big money if you market your product, service
 or opportunity to this database.
 
 Regular price will be $2995 -- ONE WEEK SPECIAL only $995 -- (SAVE $2000)
 
 YOU CAN BE ONE OF THE VERY FIRST PEOPLE TO BENEFIT
 FROM THE BEST MONEY-MAKING EMAIL LIST EVER!
 
 So, don't wait.  Order this list today before your competitors get to it first!
 
 This list is available on CD-ROM.  You can receive it via 2nd day Airborne
 Express.
 
 Call Cyber Promotions at (215) 628-9780 between 10am and 7pm
 Eastern, and ask for Brian or Alan.  Dont delay!  This is the list you've been
 looking for.
 
 48 hour special:  Order within 48 hours and receive free limited versions of
 Stealth Bomber (send 50,000 emails an hour from your local dialup account and
 cloak your account id) and List-X (collect your own email addresses). Call NOW!
 
 
 
 (For list removal, hit reply and type "remove")
