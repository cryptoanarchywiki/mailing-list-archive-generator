Are you serious?  The messages dropped were those which made (spurious)
claims of weaknesses in C2 products.  And later messages were dropped
which attempted to discuss the dropping of earlier messages.

The effect was that subscribers to the filtered list not only were not
exposed to the messages critical of C2, they were prevented from knowing
that a controversy existed about the filtering policies.

There can be little doubt of the truth of these facts.  One of us is
remembering things wrongly.

And yes, if the moderator were a McDonalds employee and he not only
dropped messages which criticized McDonalds, but also filtered out later
messages complaining about his actions, then I'd jolly well blame him.
