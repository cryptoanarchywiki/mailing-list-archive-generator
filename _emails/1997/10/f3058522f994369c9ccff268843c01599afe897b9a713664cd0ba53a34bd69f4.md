Tim, was that you writing, or was that TotoMonger forging you again?
I agree that there are problems with Misty, but it's
no more annoying than some of the other flaming on the list,
and certainly less so that Dmitri Vulis and his tentacles.

Meanwhile, there is a cypherpunks-j@htp.org, in Japanese,
and there's probably still a cypherpunks-e@htp.org in English, 
though the last time I checked it, it had been 
mostly a mirror for the cypherpunks list with almost no independent content,
and its mail gateway broke badly and splattered all over its subscribers.
				Thanks!
