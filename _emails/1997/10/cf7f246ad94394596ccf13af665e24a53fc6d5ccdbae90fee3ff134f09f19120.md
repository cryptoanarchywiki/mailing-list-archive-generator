My reason for commenting was that you recently commented that you
planned to experiment with Nyms soon, but wouldn't be announcing when.

I must admit that I also had noticed a small similarity in vocabulary
used by Cantsin, certain phrases, etc -- perhaps he's trying to
simulate your writing style, or perhaps he just naturally has similar
writing characteristics.  I'll take you word on it, anyway.

Not that it matters really -- a good point in an argument is still a
good point where ever it comes from.  I'm finding that the
non-persistent anonymous user(s) are having meaningful discourse on
pgp CAKware (I like to think of them as anonymous PGP employees -- and
I hope they're finding my comments useful -- of course it is mere
speculation or wishful thinking on my part that they are anything to
do with PGP Inc -- they could be anyone).
