Did you know that each year 51 out of every 1000 Americans are the victim of
violent crime?   That's a 1 in 20 chance of YOU being attacked THIS YEAR!  If
you're like me, you don't like those odds.

There are over 2.6 million burglaries in the U.S. every year.  The scary
fact of the matter is that it doesn't always happen to the "other guy."  If
you don't take the proper precautions it could happen to you.

That's where our new report "Personal Security Basics" comes in.  This unique
report gives you a hands on, common sense approach to protecting yourself,
your family, and your assets.

The cost of this report is just $4.95 with nothing more to buy....ever.  It
even comes with a money back guarantee!  This report shares little known
criminal techniques....and how to protect yourself against them.  It also
shows you how a criminal identifies you as a prospective victim.  

For a free sample of the type of information you will find in this report, as
well as ordering information click here--> Be Safe and Protect Your Assets! 

This is not a scam to join a multi level marketing plan, you will not be
added to any list.  It is simply an opportunity for you to protect yourself
and your family from a world with an ever increasing crime rate.  
For only $4.95...can you afford NOT to be safe?
