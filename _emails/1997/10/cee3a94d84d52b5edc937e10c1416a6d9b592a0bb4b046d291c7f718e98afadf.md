To reply to Jon Callas request for an apology for my rudeness, I'll
offer a deal:

- If I am unable to show you how to improve the GR (GAK resistance)
  of a system with a similar set of recovery properties to the CMR
  system; which replacement design is vialble to use in a typical
  corporate environment I will publically apologize for being rude,
  and for wasting your time.

- If I am able to show you how to improve the GR (GAK resistance)
  of a system with a similar set of recovery properties to the CMR
  system which replacement design is vialble to use in a typical
  corporate environment, I _don't_ want an apology.

  I want something much more interesting: 

	I want PGP Inc to implement and deploy it.

- The group which will judge this process is PGP Inc.

Do we have a deal?

Adam
