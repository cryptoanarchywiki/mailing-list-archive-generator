You obviously didn't know anything about it anyway.

An obvious lie.  Big surprise.

You complied no doubt because you knew that your 'opinions' were baseless,
and that you had no defense to a libel suit.

You have no evidence, Liar.  I'm sure they simply asked you to stop
publishing lies about them.

Actually I'm not. Even so, this is just another wormy tactic to 
deflect attention from the fact that you're lying.

I have little doubt that this is just another unfounded allegation
from the mouth of Dimitri Vulis, Noted Liar.
