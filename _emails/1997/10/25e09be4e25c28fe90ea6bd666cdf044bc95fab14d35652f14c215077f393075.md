I used to run a 24-hour Drop-In Center which had trained volunteer
counsellors on staff around the clock.
I was checking on the night shift one time, and heard Alan, one of
the night counsellors, telling a paranoid schizophrenic (who had
come to the Center when the walls began closing in on him at 4 a.m.),
"I'm a Warlock, you know. I could kill you just by looking at you."

I always wondered what became of Alan. Anyone spot him at Roby Ridge?

Those pepper-spray grenades contained organically grown pepper, from
the "We're from the Government and We're Here to Help You, Inc."
company, located in the basement of the Pentagon.
