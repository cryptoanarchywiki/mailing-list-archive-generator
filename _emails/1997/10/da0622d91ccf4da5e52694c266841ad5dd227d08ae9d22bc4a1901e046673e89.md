[Bienfait, Saskatchewan: CNN] TIM C. MAY, CYPHERPUNKS PHILOSOPHER KING,
announced earlier today that the seige of Mayonnaise Mountain by local,
state, federal, and global assault teams ended peacefully when the
heavily armed members of the NWO forces were knocked down with a wide
variety of projectiles the size of drainplugs, ranging from lead
elephant-shotgun pellets to homemade nuclear slingshot ammunition.
  Mr. May was pleased to announce that the scattered body parts of
his assailants, "are SAFE, now."
  When informed by members of the news media that he could be subject
to a fine of up to a hundred dollars by EPA officials for using lead
shot in his elephant gun, Mr. May smiled, and said, "Well, they know
where to find me."
