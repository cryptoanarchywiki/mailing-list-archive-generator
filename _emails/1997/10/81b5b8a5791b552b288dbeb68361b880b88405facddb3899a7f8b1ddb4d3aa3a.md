I agree with Tim May, I believe it's no longer an issue.  While the current
EAR/crypto regs don't expressly say "personal use OK," they can be read
that way under several exemptions, and I'm reliably told that BXA does.

In the draft EAR/crypto regs posted to John Young's site some months ago,
the BAG license exception, at (d) and (f) (see below), specifically
addresses crypto.  It's only a draft and may change, but I wouldn't worry
about it.
