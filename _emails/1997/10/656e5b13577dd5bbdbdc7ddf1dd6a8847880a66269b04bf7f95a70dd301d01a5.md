I completly agree with you. Just anoze topic that i can add is installation 
procedure,especially disk partitoning. It's a very dungerous/important 
procedure but it's description ins INSTALL.i386 is a bit too short and 
need examples(espcially). Something like - "Imagine we have disk with 
such and such patitions and now we want to install OpenBSD here & there so 
we should... It would'be _very_ helpfull.

BTW, does anybody work on installation software ? Something like in FreeBSD/RedHat ?
