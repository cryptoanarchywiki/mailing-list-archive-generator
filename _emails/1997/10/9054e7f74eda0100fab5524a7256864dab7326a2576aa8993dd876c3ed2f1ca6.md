                   NATIONWIDE CRACKDOWN ON MAIL FRAUD BEGINS

     WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal, state and local law enforcement
     agencies joined hands with more than 1,500 private sector volunteers
     Wednesday to launch a nationwide crackdown on mail fraud.
     
     "Project Mailbox," initiated by the Federal Trade Commission, U.S.
     Postal Inspection Service, the National Association of Attorneys
     General and the American Association of Retired People, targets con
     artists who use mass mail to defraud consumers.
     
     The FBI estimated several years ago that an estimated $40 billion a
     year is lost to mail and telemarketing scams that include a range of
     deceptive claims such as phony bills, bogus advance-fee card offers
     and false contest claims.
     
     One goal of the new effort is to get a more accurate and up-to-date
     estimate on the size and nature of this problem. To assist, AARP is
     asking members to turn over unsolicited and suspicious mail to law
     enforcement officials. The coalition is also launching a consumer
     education campaign.
