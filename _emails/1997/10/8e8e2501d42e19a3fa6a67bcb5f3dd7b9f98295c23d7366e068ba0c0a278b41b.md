Lots of people.  See, what goes over a public network in the clear is
much more vulnerable than what sits on your disk.  I encrypt
communicated copies of things which aren't encrypted on the disk
myself.  I suspect you do too.

But, more to the point, my argument was that keys should have
segregated uses.  One key for storage, another for receiving encrypted
emails.  I wasn't saying that you wouldn't encrypt your archived sent
& received email.  I _was_ arguing that a better way to archive email
securely is to encrypt it with a separate storage key.

Bad move dude.

See you might have a 100 bit entropy passphrase, but the recipient
might have a password of "fred".  You've conveniently archived all
your email, and you've left it decryptable by a hodge podge of other
people with unknown level of care about your level security.

Say perhaps fred deleted the email after reading, even though he has a
poor passphrase.  You have just screwed your own security.

Similar problem if it is you that has a passphrase of "william".  I
won't thank you when the feds decrypt your email to me, thanks to a
you having a poor passphrase.  (Not that I'm suggesting you do).

If your email archives are encrypted with storage keys, you avoid all
these problems, and avoid GAK arguments at the same time.

Nope.  Email is communication.  Archived email is storage.  Use
communication keys for communicated email, and storage keys for
encrypting archived email.

This is a very important point, and I can't fathom why so many people
who are otherwise on the ball are not getting it.  If you don't escrow
any communication keys, but do escrow storage keys, the GAKkers don't
get what they want, and you get all the functionality you need.  They
actually have to break into premises, and take disks, and supoena
keys.

Right?  Simple enough isn't it?

Of course it's less secure.  It's less secure almost by definition.

Lets say you have your communications encrypted with only your key,
and there is a small probability call it p1 that your key is
compromised (key board sniffer virus, hidden video cam, typing
passphrase whilst on phone (yes?), whatever). 

Well if you encrypt to another key, say a corporate escrow key, there
is an additional chance, call it probability p2, that your security
can be blown by the corporate key being compromised.  So long as the
p2 is greater than 0, which I'm sure you'll agree it is, however
small, then you have less security by using multiple encryption.

I've been arguing against using encrypt-to-self for ages.  It simply
makes me cringe when people send me email which is encrypt to self.

Sounds like a good idea.
