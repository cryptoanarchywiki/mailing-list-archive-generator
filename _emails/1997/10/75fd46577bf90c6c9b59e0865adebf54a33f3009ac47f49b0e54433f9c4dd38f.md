    alas, I must have been less than clear with the 
    statement "sendmail type" daemon.

    as Bill Stewart so aptly stated:

>   sendmail is such a wretched hive of

>   really wants to mess with it. 

    is an abomination; in fact, about 1980/1 or such, I had a
    reason to carefully exam a few of the internals;
    subsequently, Eric Allman had good reason to be very
    circumspect where he crossed the street. <g> that
    and the rules set of the M4 macro processor --an even worse 
    abomination. speaking of Eric, I have not seen or heard for
    many years...?

    as Bill also pointed out, somethings could be done via the
    EHLO extensions, but the limitations would be to great.

    secondly, as Jon Callas points out, there is the option of
    TLS via SSL. however, that takes the wrapper off in a store 
    and forward situation and you can not control the hops.

    ** what I had in mind: **

    literally a point to point, port to port daemon pair 
    --operating in a trusted pair mode. 

    if store and forward was necessary, there would be a
    requirement for a dynamically maintained table similar
    to DNS, and a means of securing the data.  in order to
    implement store and forward, a web of trust would be
    essential, otherwise only point to point is feasible.

    in other words, a system similar in function to MixMaster
    except that it is fully end to end secure --well, as secure 
    as one can be using the IP carriers, SSL or not. 

    the are many nuances: for instance, provisions for key 
    lookup. 

    in all honesty, I have not been as concerned with all the 
    possibilities, just the design of and easily installable and
    maintainable daemon to satisfy the basic requirement, and 
    sufficient hooks to implement functionality without 
    compromising security.

    meanwhile, our hands are full with the PGP sell-out to the
    man, willing, or kicking and screaming, or even sold out by 
    the vultures and beancounters with an agenda: money. even 
    without presuming a current sellout, I suspect the whole
    affair was compromised from the gate --money talks, shit
    walks; and, there are many other unanswered questions, 
    some which I floated a year ago; regardless, someone is 
    schilling for uncle.

    in any event, all feedback is sincerely appreciated; none of
    us, weathered and scratched old grizzlies like me, or 
    cheetahs new to the veldt, have a corner on ideas. to 
    survive, the old just get meaner, and trade on their 
    experience. <g>

        attila
