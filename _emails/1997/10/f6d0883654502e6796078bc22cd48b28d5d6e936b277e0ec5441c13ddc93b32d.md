Why is the situation more stable if both parties are armed? If I were
confronted by a armed burglar and we were facing off I would pull the
trigger as soon as I got a lock. If their gun wasn't in a ready position I
would warn them and if they so much as flinched I'd drop them. If they were
unarmed I might beat them senseless with the gun but I would not shoot them
unless they made a motion to rush me, then I would go for a non-lethal shot
unless the distance was less than a dozen feet (rushing distance) or so in
which case I prefer head shots followed by center-torso (heart) shots. I'd
also train to fire 3 shot groups. The one exception would be center-torso
shots if they were wearing heavy or bulky clothing that might hide a vest.
In that situation (assuming it wasn't a rush) I would shoot for the inside
of the thigh at the hip-joint. Hit that artery and your dead without
immediate medical attention (which I am not likely to give after just
shooting the SOB). If it was a rush situation I would dump the clip into
their chest moving upward, hoping the KE would slow them down enough to get
a clear head shot (this would be what I practiced the most as well).

No, despite your claim the most stable situation is to not have the invasion
in the first place, followed by the victim being the only one armed. Anything
else is a gun-battle waiting for a twitch.
