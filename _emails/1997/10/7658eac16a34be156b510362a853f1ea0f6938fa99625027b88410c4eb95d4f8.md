Classic error for a news report on the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court denied cert. Lance Lindblom v. FBI, 97-82,
Oct. 14, 1997.  It did not rule on the merits of the case.

The Court did not order the FBI to purge the files. It did
not tell the FBI to buy Mr. Lindblom a cup of coffee. It
simply decided not to review the decision of the lower
court.

Welcome back.

M.
