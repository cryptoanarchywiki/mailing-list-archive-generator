How about suggesting a make variable HAS_LIBCRYPT to the FreeBSD people?
We could set it in <bsd.own.mk> or something like this (to a value
meaning "we don't have it and we don't need it either), and FreeBSD could
do similar.

Another way were patching the third party program's Makefile accordingly.
We should introduce a patches-${OPSYS} directory having precedence before
the patches directory of a port. Thus we could maintain our special patches
for ports which need them while continuing to use the FreeBSD ports where
they work out of the box. I see now that this is already implemented in
<bsd.port.mk>, so we could just USE that.
