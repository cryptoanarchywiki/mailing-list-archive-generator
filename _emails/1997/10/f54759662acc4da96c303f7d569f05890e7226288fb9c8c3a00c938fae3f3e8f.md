Way too high for commercial use. Get it down to something like .01 and that
would be workable I suspect (haven't done the math). Course this raises the
issue of who pays for dumped mail on a commercial box. Should the customer
pay since it was their action that instigated the drop? Or perhaps the
remailer since they were selling a service which they didn't provide at
their discretion?

Not to me. It's your box and your money, set any policy that you desire.
If I as a user don't like it, I'll beat feet...

Let's generalize a bit to see if we can get a clearer picture.

 -   traffic that seems to be duplicate.

     What if the digital signature on each one is valid implying the
     originator intended to send the 3,000 pieces. Do you dump them
     and take the money?

 -   traffic from specific parties whose reputation capital is low.

     As a business should this really matter as long as the creetin
     pays the bill?

 -   traffic of an abnormal format

     Don't see any issues with this one.

Are there any other classes that you can think of that you might want to
filter on?

Ok, so you are doing header filtering.

Let's see if we can put some numbers to it...

We receive n pieces of mail. n/10 is tossed at reception based on header
filtering. For each mail that gets to the remailer code we sent m cover
messages and 1 real message.

So the remailer handles a total of (n - n/10) + (m + 1)(n-n/10)  pieces in a
given time period, t. Let z stand for (n - n/10) the actual number of
processible traffic, we can reduce this to z + (m + 1) z.

Let's assume now that we go ahead and transmit cover for those emails we get
something like z + (m + 1) z + m ( n/10 ). We don't add a 1 to the m(n/10)
because we don't have a real outgoing to process.

So the total traffic load of the remailer can be represented by:

 L = z + (m + 1) z + m ( n/10 )

or,

 L = (n - n/10) + (m + 1)(n - n/10) + m(n/10)

Now if you look at a travelling salesman problem you see quickly that the
complexity grows quite quickly. This produces a traffic analysis load of
something of the form,

 T = L ^ v

Where v represents the complexity factor in dealing with the possible
combinations possible.

So, without actualy plugging numbers in there, I would say it looks like a
small increase in output could grow pretty quickly because of the power
growth factor in the extra traffic and processing it.

Ok, let's add a 'software failure' category.

If I understand you the remailer would send outbound traffic to its input
for distribution to your subscribers? I don't believe it would factor into
the analysis at all if all the source destinations are the same. Outbound
traffic from party A that went to party B would be important to track. So,
if you wanted to do this sort of stuff and you wanted Mallet to chase their
tail I would randomly pick source addresses from my subscriber base and send
the bogus messages to my subscribers making shure nobody received an email
from themselves. Then it looks like everyone is involved in a conspiracy...

It has nothing to do with limiting speech so I doubt you'd have a 1st leg to
stand on. Furthermore, the 1st doesn't guarantee the right to anonymity. If
you want to claim that as a fundamental right you'd need to use the 9th and
10th. It does have to do with being able to trace the perp back if
needed. I am not saying I agree with it, just recognize that reasonable
people will see this lack of tracability via a court order as a clear threat
to their security at all levels.
