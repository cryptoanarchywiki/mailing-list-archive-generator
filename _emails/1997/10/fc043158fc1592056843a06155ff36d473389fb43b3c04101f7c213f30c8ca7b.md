  Anyone notice the court ruling in regard to the company that sued
to retrieve information that was inside an employee's head, claiming
that his employment agreement made *all* of his ideas the property
of the company.
  Anyone notice that the Thought Judge ruled that the Thought Laws
required the individual to divulge said ideas, or be imprisoned by
the Thought Police?

Government Access to Thoughts = Government Access to Brains
