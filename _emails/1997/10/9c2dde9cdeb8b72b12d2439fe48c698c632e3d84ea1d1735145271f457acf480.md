Since I have no responsibility for either site I don't much care
Actually neither has responsibility as a security watchdog,
that is the NSA's job.

Actually I think you are the spoiled brat. If you had any real 
experience of computer security you would know who I am 
and who I work with.

One of the principles of propaganda is reflection - poor 
propagandists accuse others of their own faults. My guess
is that Attila is a sixteen year old schoolkid who thinks that
downloading PGP and reading Bruce's book makes him a 
security expert.

The real complacent folk are the ones that put their trust in 
cargo cult readings of Bill Morris.
