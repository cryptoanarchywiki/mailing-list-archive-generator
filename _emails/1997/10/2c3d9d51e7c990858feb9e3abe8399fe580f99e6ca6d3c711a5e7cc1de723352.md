Yep, I've done both of these.

Mail spool didn't count on quota, so I wrote some scripts to store and
retrieve messages from /usr/mail/aba.  Didn't actually use them, but I
enjoyed writing them :-)

Also we had a temporary scratch 1 Gig partition on one machine.  Your
stuff was defined to live for 1 week after last access.  So I put

	find /scratch -name \* -exec touch {} \; &

in my .login.  So the stuff was always up to date and lived for ever :-)

The hack caught on, and soon everyone was doing this, and I got a
polite note from admin of the system in question telling me (they
determined I was the ring leader somehow) to pass the word around that
this was not ok, and reprisals in terms of deletion of touched files
would occur to those doing it.

Phun stuff.  (Oddly that and other experimentation ensured I was not
the admins favourite student.)
