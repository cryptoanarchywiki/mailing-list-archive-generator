While I'm not too concerned about your present state of happiness, if you read
the cited article, you may find that it is less off-topic than you thought. The
quote was chosen as a "text-bite" that - while echoing sentiments familiar to
many people on this list - is seldom heard from within the US administration.

Magaziner's often been good for politically inopportune statements. 
To quote from an article in a Canadian business newspaper in late July:

"Ira Magaziner, Clinton's international emissary on the issue of how governments
should respond to the explosive growth of business on the Net, said any attempt
to regulate its content would not only be a mistake, it would be futile."

Let's wish him success in his current endeavours, ;-)

This is an off-topic rant.  Anyone who wants to make me happy will convince
the NYT to investigate the following question:

How did Magaziner get to be "Clinton's Top Internet Adviser"?

Last I knew, he was the Clintons' "Top Health Care Adviser".
That is, after he was Rick Miller's  $1k/hr "Top Wang Labs Turnaround
Adviser", 1 year before they declared bankruptcy.  For a guy with such a
string of successes, he seems to keep popping up someplace new.
