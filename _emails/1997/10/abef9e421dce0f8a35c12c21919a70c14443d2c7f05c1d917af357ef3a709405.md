* In April, Premier Lien Chan of Taiwan ordered a crackdown on
the national craze of public betel-nut chewing, which he said was
responsible for mouth cancer, slimy sidewalks when they are spit
out, and immorality, in that they are mostly sold by young,
underdressed women at sidewalk stands.  The betel nut is
reportedly a mild stimulant and is slightly more expensive than a
cigarette. 

* The Washington Post reported in May that some tribes in Yemen
routinely kidnap tourists and hold them for days, though treating
them well, regaling them with propaganda, and ultimately offering
them to the government in exchange for political concessions, such
as new road construction.  Said the speaker of the Yemen
parliament, "Kidnapping is part of tourism.  [The] tourist will end
up learning about the customs of the tribes, as well as their good
hospitality."
