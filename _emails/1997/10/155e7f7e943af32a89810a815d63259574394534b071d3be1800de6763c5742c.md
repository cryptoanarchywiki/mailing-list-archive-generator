At the technical level, is there a meaningful difference between the
brothers? Aren't we really talking about third-party access to
communications, and second-party access to stored data ... with the
"brother" distinction being one made at a social/political level, as a
judgement about the legitimacy of the access or the size of the actor,
rather than the character of the access?
