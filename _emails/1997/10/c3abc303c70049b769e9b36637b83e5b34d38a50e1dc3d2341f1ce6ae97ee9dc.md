By the way, the main discussion for this Bernstein point is on
misc.legal.computing, where followups have been redirected. He asked for
examples, modern and old, of where the government's position could be used
for prior restraint and censorship.

I suggested JPEGs and GIFs, which are clearly machine-readable instructions
telling a computer how to write a pattern of pixels in a display window.
Are we to presume that such JPEGs and GIFs (and WAVs and MOVs and...) have
lost their First Amendment protection? If upheld, the CDA would not even be
needed.

Oh, folks, don't submit your own examples _here_. Do it in the appropriate
thread in misc.legal.computing, so Bernstein can get a lot of examples
collected.

Yes, they snoop. Out of boredom, out of instructions from Administration,
whatever.  Encryption will help, but not if the same snoopers can continue
to snoop.

I disagree. Snoopware will tend to centralize the files to a point where
snooping is easier. Those using PGP 5.0 and earlier will likely be told to
switch to the snoopware version.

While many may not encrypt now, this is changing. Snoopware rolls back the
clock.

To be clear: we should be advocating the wider use of strong encryption,
not arguing that snoopware is better than nothing. Nothing is not really
the proper alternative to weigh snoopware against.

Why does this professor not have the option of PGP 5.0? That's the real
alternative to consider.

(Some of us have fears that development of the "free" version of PGP will
not be supported or developed. While PGP may _hope_ that many buy the PGP
5.0 they plan to sell to individuals, the fact is that most individuals
won't pay money for what they can get for free. This is presumably a
motivation for the development of PGP for Business, with Netscape-like
incentives for corporate buys.)

We all agree that widespread adoption of PGP 5.5 could be scary. Hence our
concerns.

(Even more scary are the many ways various governments could gain easy
access to the CMR keys. Whereas enforcement of key escrow is difficult with
millions of diverse, anarchic users and approaches, CMR essentially
centralizes the target nicely.)
