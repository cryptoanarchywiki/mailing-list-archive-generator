Many people do this. Note that most SWAT teams have silenced weapons to
take out guard dogs, however.  From a distance, before the dog even reacts.

Certainly a possibility.

This is well-covered, too. Most states will not prosecute someone for
shooting an intruder who is INSIDE THE HOUSE. The usual language, which
lawyers know, is about "reasonable fear for one's life." It's easy to
convince a jury that one was in fear for one's life when confronting an
intruder inside one's home. Less easy outside. And so on.

Civil liability is another matter entirely. Often the surviving perp or the
dead perp's relatives will sue for whatever the homeowner has, claiming
some degree of overreaction, blah blah blah. And this being Amerika, often
juries will award huge sums.

Obviously. But I wasn't talking about this. Jeesh.

Then think of this as evolution in action.
