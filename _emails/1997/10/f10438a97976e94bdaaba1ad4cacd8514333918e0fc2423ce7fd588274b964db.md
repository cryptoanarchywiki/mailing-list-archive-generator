Let me give you the *dirt* on Monty Cantsin.
Anyone who has visited h/is/er alleged website will realize that I speak
the trooth when I say that s/he was kicked out of the Electronic Forgery
Foundation when it was discovered that s/he was forging posts in h/is/er
own name.
The EFF has a policy of disbarrment for those who maintain consisent
forged personas. After all, without rules there is chaos...and
vice-versa.
