Yes, the thrust of my comments was about OpenPGP.

The OpenPGPers were fretting about how to incorporate GAK and CAK and GMR
and CMR into their "open," and (presumably) international, standard, and I
said:  Keep it Simple, Stupid.

With luck, OpenPGP will displace PGP for Corporate Controllers and PGP,
Inc. will have to back pedal to remain compliant.

(Meaning no ill will toward PGP, Inc., but if they see their economic
future lies in compromising key security by building in CAK and CMR....get
my drift?)
