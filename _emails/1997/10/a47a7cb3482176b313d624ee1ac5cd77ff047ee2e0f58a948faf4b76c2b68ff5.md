  The same is true of most places, even the ones known as being
dangerous enclaves of the 'bad' people.
  The fact is, those who live in any given area generally do not
feel too threatened when going out and about in 'their' part of
town. 

  I spend time in the areas of Regina, Saskatchewan and Oakland,
California, that most of the 'regular' folk avoid. I have seen
people shot and stabbed in both places, but I feel safe enough to
walk those streets alone.
  I have been robbed a couple times in both areas, and have given
up the cash I was holding, even when I was armed much better than
those robbing me. I didn't feel like killing them.

  Kiss my ass. Racial discrimination is not *recognized* in the 
communities at large.
  I like to use the word 'nigger' as often as possible in Berkeley,
California, (a prison for the politically correct) just because it
pisses all of those oh-so-liberal hypocrites who shit their pants
when a black person moves into *their* neighborhood.
  I like to use the word 'wagon-burner' in Regina when dealing with
social workers who use the politically correct term, Native Canadian
while they discriminate against the 'wagon-burners' in every possible
way.

  No. The fact that I did not list the 'volumes' of examples of teen
violence in Canada is newsworthy.

  Sounds like the typical *American* gun owner.

  Canadians whack out fewer people with weapons than Americans, but 
so do people in prison. Go figure...
  Canada does not have the magnitude of problems that the US has 
because there are only about 20 million people in the whole goddamn
country, and there are not nearly as many hugely populated cities.
  As well, Canadians spend a great amount of their time huddled 
inside their igloos during the year, and are too busy trying to
keep warm to spend much time murdering their fellow citizens.

  Got to run. I'm a cop, and I haven't beaten up my quota of 
wagon-burners for the day.
