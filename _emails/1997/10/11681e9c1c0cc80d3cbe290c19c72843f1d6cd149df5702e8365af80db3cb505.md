No, instead, Canadian students terrorize each other with old-fashioned
forms of violence, like at Cole Harbor high school in Newfie'land, where
they use baseball bats to keep the niggers in line, and in Montreal,
where four teenagers have been driven to suicide in the last few weeks
by the 'taxing' they have endured from the youth gangs that roam the
subways.
Perhaps Canada needs 'more' regulation...
