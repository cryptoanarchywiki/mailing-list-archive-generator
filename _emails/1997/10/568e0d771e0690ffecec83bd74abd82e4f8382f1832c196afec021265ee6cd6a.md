My favorite excerpt:

> Illinois State Police feared that any progress in getting Allen - who's
> suspected to suffer from paranoia, delusions and suicidal thoughts - to
> exit on her own may have been undone. On Sunday, troopers broke out most
> of the remaining windows in Allen's house, tossed nine pepper-spray
> grenades inside and sent a police dog in to subdue Allen.
> 
> All the tactics failed: Allen fired what police believe was a small-caliber
> handgun as troopers inserted mirrors into her house to look around, she
> apparently huddled in a bathroom to ward off the pepper spray, and she 
> shot the police dog through the mouth.

[snip]

> Police movement toward the house was sparked by a long silence inside.
> Despite sophisticated surveillance and listening devices monitoring
> the house, Allen hadn't been seen or heard since 1 p.m. Saturday,
> McDonald said (not 1 a.m. as previously reported). Troopers wanted to
> see if she had collapsed or fallen ill.
> 
> Should similar circumstances arise again, police may try different

             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
