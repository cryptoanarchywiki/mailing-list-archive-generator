Greetings!

This is to announce a CCS Lunch Talk, Friday, October 17, from 12-1:30 pm in
E40-170.  Bring your lunch and join us for an interesting session.

We are pleased to welcome Jay M. Tenenbaum, Chairman of CommerceNet to CCS.
He will speak on component-based commerce and an exciting new project.  See
you there!!

Component-based Commerce
Jay M. Tenenbaum
Chairman, CommerceNet

Digital anarchy is threatening the explosive growth of Internet commerce.
Proprietary applications and platforms cannot communicate above the level of
browsers. Websites are difficult to locate and incomprehensible to software
agents. Such limitations prevent online businesses from leveraging each
other's services, resulting in closed markets and trading communities.

In response, CommerceNet has launched an ambitious object-oriented
interoperability framework initiative called eCo System. eCo treats all
commerce services on the Web as business objects. It provides the
infrastructure (a Common Business Language, standardized metadata and
middleware) for combining them in novel ways to build virtual companies,
markets, and trading communities. eCo complements commercial ecommerce
platforms, enabling them to communicate with one another, thus expanding the
market for all.

eCo System promises to transform the Internet into a massive economy of
online services, all linked through a common framework. Companies will be
able to encapsulate their services (e.g., shipping, banking) as eCo objects,
that customers can seemlessly integrate into their own business processes.
Entrepreneurs will be able to create innovative value-added services that
compare, aggregate, integrate, and translate data across companies --
finding the best price or the closest supplier for example. This potential
for instant partnering and for rapidly experimenting with new business
concepts could spark an explosion of entrepreneurial activity rivaling that
of the web itself. Based on market analyses by Forrester and IDC,
CommerceNet projects a $1 Billion market for eCo-enabled  Internet commerce
building blocks and tools by the year 2000. The Internet commerce
transactions enabled by these components could exceed $100 Billion.

The talk will cover eCo System from both a technology and business
perspective.

Dr. Jay M. Tenenbaum (BS MIT '64; Ph.D. Stanford '71) is widely acknowledged
as a founder of Internet commerce and its leading visionary. In 1990 he
started EIT, the company that pioneered  the enabling security and payment
infrastructure. In 1994 he formed CommerceNet, the leading industry
association for Internet commerce with nearly 600 corporate members
worldwide. Dr. Tenenbaum has been a consulting Professor of Computer Science
at Stanford University and currently serves on the boards of six Internet
start ups.
