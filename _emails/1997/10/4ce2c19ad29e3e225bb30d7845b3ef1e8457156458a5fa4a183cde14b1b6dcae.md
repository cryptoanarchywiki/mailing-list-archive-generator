I'm thinking of spending a few days in the Bay Area in about a month, maybe
the week of Thanksgiving. My S.O., a cypherpunkish Net and
telecommunications lawyer here in DC, seems likely to join me.

I'd love to come to a Bay Area cypherpunk meeting if there are any then,
and spend some time with folks out there. Any plans to have one around Nov
24-27?

This is more of a pleasure than a business trip, though I'll write an
article if there are any interesting developments on the crypto-front. (Any
suggestions on places to stay?)

-Declan
