Nor do I have to present any evidence.  I'm not the one selling StrongHold.
I have received several threatening communications from C2Net's lawyers, 
which were discussed at length on this list.  To avoid unpleasant disputes
I agreed not to disseminate my opinions about StrongHold.
Please keep this in mind if you consider buying it.
