DH between mail clients and servers is a really fine idea if you're
starting from scratch, but sendmail is such a wretched hive of
crime, corruption, and villainy that nobody in their right mind
really wants to mess with it.  You could implement it as a sendmail
extension using the EHLO stuff, but you'd have to go get people
to adopt it widely once you'd done it; I suppose if you could talk
Netscape and Eudora into adding DH exchange to their client code
and get it into a few popular servers, you'd have a large fraction 
of the Internet's email encrypted, which would be a Good Thing.
It'd still have some major traffic analysis issues,
and if you want to deal with the Man In The Middle problem,
you need a key distribution infrastructure, which is much harder.

An alternative approach is to encrypt everything using IPSEC,
and you don't have to mess with Sendmail, but there are
performance issues, and there's a lot of work getting it deployed also.
				Thanks!
