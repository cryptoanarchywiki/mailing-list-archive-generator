( BW)(GEMPLUS) Gemplus Announces Availability Of GPK4000, Public Key
Smart Card

    Business Editors

    MONTGOMERYVILLE, Penn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 13, 1997--

       First Smart Card To Combine Digital Signature,
    On-Board Key Generation, and Electronic Payment With
               Multi-Application Functionality

   Gemplus today announced the availability of GPK4000, the first
public key smart card to combine digital signature, on-board key
generation, and electronic payment with multi-application
functionality.
   The GPK4000 smart card, with its advanced cryptographic
co-processor, can be used to secure Internet, intranet and extranet
transactions in such applications as electronic commerce and computer
security.
   GPK4000 features full cryptographic functionality, including
1024-bit RSA-based digital signature at sub-second speed and 4 Kbytes
of application memory.  Additionally, it provides an on-board key
generation mechanism that ensures that the private component of the
public key that performs the cardholder's digital signature is never
seen outside the card.
   GPK4000 keys, whether generated internally or loaded by the
issuer, can be certified by any certification authority through the
card's ability to store industry-standard X.500 certificates in the
card's memory.  The card has also been specifically designed to
strengthen the security of Web sites that rely on the SSL3 protocol
for mutual authentication of client and Web server.
   "We are pleased that industry leader Gemplus has chosen RSAs
industry leading technology for their high-quality, high- performance
smart card,"  said Jim Bidzos, president of RSA Data Security, Inc.
"RSA is considered to be the most trusted encryption available,
whether for Web browsers or smart cards.  When it comes to
applications of smart cards such as electronic cash or personal
identity, there is no such thing as too much security.  Users can use
these smart cards with the greatest of confidence."
   Gemplus GPK4000 cards will be used in the upcoming version 2.0
release of ImagineCard, the only complete security solution for both
corporate applications and Web services, jointly developed by
Hewlett-Packard, Informix and Gemplus.
   "The additional capabilities of Gemplus GPK4000 enable our
customers to deploy more comprehensive smart card applications based
on ImagineCard solutions,"  said Christian Roy, general manager of HP
Enterprise Networking and Security Division.  "Through ImagineCard
and the strength of Gemplus GPK4000 card, HP meets its commitment to
bring the benefits of smart cards to support the extended enterprises
business processes."
   "Authentication is a necessary component for the widespread
adoption of electronic commerce,"  said Anil Pereira, director of
corporate marketing for VeriSign.  "VeriSign Digital Ids stored on
Gemplus GPK4000 smart cards provide Internet and corporate network
users with a convenient, portable method for secure access to online
resources and a trusted, proven solution to participate in secure
communications and online payments."

                  Gemplus Public Key Cards

   GPK4000 is the second in a line of Gemplus public key smart cards
for securing Internet, intranet and extranet services.  The GPK2000
card, with 512- and 768-bit key lengths was announced in 1996.
   The GPK (Gemplus Public Key) family will continue to be enhanced,
with future versions including more memory and additional
functionality.  The GPK card range is compliant with ISO7816-1, -2,
-3, -4 and is EMV compatible.  GPK4000 features a suite of developer
algorithms, including RSA, DSA/DSS, DES, Triple-DES, MD5 and SHA1.

                     GPK Developers Kit

   The GPK Developers Kit enables developers to prototype
applications.  It includes:

    --  PILOT GPK, Windows-based software for rapid application
        development and personalization;

    --  A card reader (GCR410) with RS232 serial port connection;

    --  Sample GPK4000 cards; and

    --  A reference manual and application notes.
