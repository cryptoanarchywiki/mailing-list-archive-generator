That is bullshit!

So far, there have been claims to a backdoor but no actual proof.
Everytime someone asks for said proof, there is a huge amount of handwaving
and misdirection as to why any sort of proof cannot be revealed.  Each time
the excuses get more and more elaborate.  "C2Net will sue us." "We can make
more money if we keep it secret." "It is already well known."

But the excuses get pretty thin after a while without any real proof.

Yes, employees of C2Net have acted in a stupid manner.  But, in my opinion,
you are using that as a smokescreen to avoid having to reveal anything
substantial.  (Because you do not have anything substantial.)

You can point fingers, accuse people of all sorts of things, and make all
the wheeping wailing and knashing of teeth you want.  It still somes down
to the fact that you have shown no hard evidence that such a backdoor exists.

Put up or shut up.
