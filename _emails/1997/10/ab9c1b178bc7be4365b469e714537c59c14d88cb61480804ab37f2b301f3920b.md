[Bienfait, Saskatchewan: CNN] THE BARTENDER at the Coal Dust Saloon
announced earlier today that the seige of the Whitehouse by armed
CypherPunks ended peacefully today, when the occupants were knocked
down with Teflon-coated, hollow-point Destructor bullets the size of
drain plugs.
  Chief CypherPunks Spokesperson, [Your Name Here], was pleased to
announce that the Whitehouse occupants, including the late Director
of the FBI, "are SAFE, now."
