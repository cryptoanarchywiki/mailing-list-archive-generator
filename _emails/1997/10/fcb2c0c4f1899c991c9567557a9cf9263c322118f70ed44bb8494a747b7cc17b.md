   If this is true (and I have no reason to believe it isn't), then why is the

   that was posted internationally from PGP?
   
I just got through talking to one of the developers, and think I found what
you're talking about, Bruce.

In "pgp.c" of the Unix 5.0 published edition, there's some old Viacrypt code
with a comment that says, 'This is our version of "Commercial Key Escrow"' but
in fact just adds an additional recipient to the encryption list.

It is not in any shipping PGP product. If there's anything to laugh about
in all
this, if you try to use the feature in the Unix freeware, it core-dumps. It
doesn't appear at all in the Mac and Windows code.

It's completely gone as of now.
