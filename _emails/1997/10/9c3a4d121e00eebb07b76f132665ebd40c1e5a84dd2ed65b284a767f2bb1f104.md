IIRC, it only worked for e=3.  In that case, since gcd(e,(p-1)(q-1)) = 1,
we must have that p and q are each 2 mod 3.  Then, since (p-1)(q-1) | de-1,
we have that e d - r (p-1)(q-1) = 1 for some positive integer r.
Taking this mod 3, we see that r is 2 mod 3.  But r = (ed-1)/[(p-1)(q-1)]
< (3(p-1)(q-1)-1)/[(p-1)(q-1)] < 3, so r=2.  Thus d = [2(p-1)(q-1)+1]/3
= 2(n-p-q)/3 + 1.  If p and q are each about half the length of n, then
d agrees with 2(n-1)/3 for about its first half.
