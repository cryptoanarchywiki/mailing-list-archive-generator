Lie from Pomes: I never in my life sent anything to this motherfucker.

Another lie from Pomes: a few days ago the motherfucker wrote:

Clearly Pomes lied about having killfiled me.

Pomes harrasses anonymous remailer operators: he has been complaining to
Jeff Berches's employer and upstream, contributing to his decision
to shut down the cajones remailer:

Tim Skirvin condones and supports net-abuse by Net.Scum like Pomes,
Hannigan, and Varshavchik.

Please tell Qualcomm what you think about their employee attacking
the anonymous remailers.
