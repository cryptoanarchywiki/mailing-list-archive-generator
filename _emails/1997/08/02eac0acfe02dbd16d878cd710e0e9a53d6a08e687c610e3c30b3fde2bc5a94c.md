Most folks would, today, but this was not always a given in our
constitutional jurisprudence.  It's a post-14th Amendment
development, the Bill Of Rights having been understood by the
SCt to have been applied to the states by virtue of the 14th
Amendment's restrictions on state governments.  It's never 
been an impeccable logic, but it seems to get to the right
result.  For most folks, anyway:)
