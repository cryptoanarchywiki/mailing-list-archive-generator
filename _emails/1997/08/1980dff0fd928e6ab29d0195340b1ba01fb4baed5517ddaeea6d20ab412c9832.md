There appears to be a wonderful market for long-range nonlethal
stun weapons. I wonder, if a tagger is marking your building,
would it be legal to stun him from a distance and then call the
cops?

Rape can be argued to be deserving of serious punishment of some kind,
but would tagging deserve death when a nonlethal option exist? Could
not the woman stun the rapist and then call the cops?
