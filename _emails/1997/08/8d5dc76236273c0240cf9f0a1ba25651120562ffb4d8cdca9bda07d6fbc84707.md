Anyone got some ideas for content to stuff on the eternity service?

It looks like there might be a "wired news" article, and it would be
nice to have a few tasty items on-line.

I suspect it might be a better idea to start with the milder stuff,
something which has reasonable popular support which makes governments
look stupid for trying to censor.

Things like:

	- memoirs of dead french presidents doctor
	- radikal

Other ideas?

Adam
