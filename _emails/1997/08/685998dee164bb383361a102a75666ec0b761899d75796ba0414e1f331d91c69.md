TWOK!  Au contraire, mon ami...

Breaking a 2048 bit key is approximately 1E16 (10 to the 16th power)
harder than breaking a 512 bit key.  The RSA-129 factoring effort
broke a key of approximately 430 bits using about 6,000 MIPS years.
That is about 2E17 instructions.  Some estimates are that with
current algorithms, a 512 bit key could be broken with not too much
more work.

If so, the total work to factor a 2048 bit key would be roughly
1E33 instructions.

Eric Drexler estimates that with nanotech, it should be possible
to create a 1 GHz processer that fits in 1/8 of a cubic micron.
It would take 1E24 such processors to factor a 2048 bit number.
If we wanted to factor that 2048 bit key in 1E6 seconds, a couple
of weeks, we would need 1E18 processors, which would fit in a cube
100,000 microns on a side.  This is 10 cm on a side, about the
volume of a soccer ball.  A far cry from the whole earth, no?
