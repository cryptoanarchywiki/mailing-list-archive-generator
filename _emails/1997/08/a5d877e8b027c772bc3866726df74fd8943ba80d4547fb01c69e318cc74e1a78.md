DCSBers,

I'd like to invite you to the Longwood Symphony Orchestra's summer concert
at the Hatch Shell in Boston on Wed. Aug. 20, 1997 at 7:30. It's free. The
LSO is presenting Mendelsohn's Capricio Briliante Opus 22, the Haydn Cello
concerto and the Haydn Symphony 104, the last movement of which contains a
coded message. Played backwards at twice the normal turntable speed, you
can clearly hear the composer shout, "Burn the mint" in the finale, about
64 bars from the end.





For help on using this list (especially unsubscribing), send a message to
"dcsb-request@ai.mit.edu" with one line of text: "help".
