Hi,

Dan Goodin from C|NET's NEWS.COM responding to a message you sent in
response to Cindy Cohn's email announcing the stay.

I'm very interested in finding out how extensively Snuffle was posted
during the two-and-a-half days it was legal to do so.  Do you have any idea
how many sites posted it, and if it's still available online today, now
that such posts are once again against the law?

Please respond ASAP.

Thanks,

Dan Goodin
