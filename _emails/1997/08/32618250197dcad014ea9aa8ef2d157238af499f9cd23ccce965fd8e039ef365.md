Like what Kent, asking cops to defend you, from Cops?  Sorry, Kent,
that method doesn't work.  Filing a lawsuit, or bringing them to court
won't stop em from doing it again, also, a chance remains that they
won't get convicted, after all, almost any police force I've seen
always gets off for doing things.

Remember, plungering someone like that is definitely a cruel and
unusual punishment, and therefore a crime in itself.

Those pigs should rot in jail for violating someones constitutional
rights.

However, the eye for an eye thing would make for an interesting
punishment for the cops.

you."
