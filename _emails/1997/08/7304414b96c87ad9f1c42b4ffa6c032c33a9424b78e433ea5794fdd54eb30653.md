I assume this is a joke, as Germany is one of the last places one would
choose for a censorship-free site!

(Pace the usual points about Neo-Nazi material being banned in Germany, the
Church of Scientology facing pressures it would never face in the U.S.,
etc.)

But I'll contact Jim Finn about hosting my "The So-Called Holocaust" Web
page, which explains how the International Jew Conspiracy has succeeded in
convincing the gullible that Jews were persecuted in the WW II, when all
right-thinking Aryans know full well that they were coddled and rewarded
and given choice vacation spots in "the East."

Free Spirits should be an ideal host for this material.
