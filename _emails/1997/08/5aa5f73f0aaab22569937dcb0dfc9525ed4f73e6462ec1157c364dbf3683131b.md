  I haven't seen any mention lately of the mythical PGP Lib 3.0.
The last I recall hearing was that it was waiting to be release this month
when certain patents expired.

  Does anyone know which patents or algorithms those are?  I know that D-H expired
back in April, but what about RSA and any other "basic" algorithms?
