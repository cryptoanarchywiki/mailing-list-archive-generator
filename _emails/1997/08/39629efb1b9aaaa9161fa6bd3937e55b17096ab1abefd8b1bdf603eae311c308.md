We've put the 39-page criminal complaint against Aldrich 
Ames and Rosario Ames, with arrest warrant and requests 
for search and seizure at:

   http://jya.com/ames.htm  (93K)

Which may be compared to those of Jim Bell, in order,
as Bob Hettinga merrily portends, to ready us to ponder
each our own upcoming toilet plunge.

Too bad that Jim didn't get (or hasn't yet gotten) the kind
of swell-solitary-cell Rick and Rosario briefly enjoyed for CIA 
toilet diving (a la Trainspotting).
