One can contend that the Con also doesn't particularly permit income
redistribution; "providing for the general welfare" wasn't really
precisely defined...  

The 10th does also acknowledge the right of the states to do whatever
their people will let them, subject to the rights of the people (also
not precisely defined) and the powers delegated by the states to the Feds
in the Con.

>In case you haven't caught the clue, people don't belong to the government.
Y'all appear to be violently agreeing on that point.
