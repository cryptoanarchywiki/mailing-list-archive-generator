It's not just unconventionally encrypted files - any encrypted file
that is unsigned can be modified without detection.  I brought this
to everyones attention because far too many people assume that encryption
provides integrity.

Yes, this is part of the point I was making.

Of course it is easier to modify uncompressed files, but even compressed
files can be tampered with - it's just an awful lot harder.

 
> Could you or he elaborate on your attack?  

In addition to turning files to garbage, I was pointing out that files can
be truncated.  This could be very serious, if, say, you removed the second
of a pair of financial transactions, or perhaps removed the last line of
a security program, eg. if the last line of a script is "chmod -w filename"
and you can remove this line, then you may be in trouble.

As well as trashing files, and truncating them, it is also important
to remember that the last 8 bytes can be modified without detection
if the plaintext is known.  This could be very serious.  Think of
the damage that could be done in 8 bytes ( "rm -rf /").

I agree that these attacks are very unlikely to occur, but I just wanted
to bring it to everyone's attention.

If the plaintext is known, I could come up with a change to the last 8 bytes
that would be valid (well, perhaps not - I don't know ZIP compression
too well).
