That was my fault, I improperly killed sendmail and then went to the
country for a day or two.

I have no idea how such a diversion could happen, if we assume that no
hacking is taking place. I think that it is more likely that you were
confused by headers. It seems that now cypherpunks list works just fine,
although I would appreciate if you correct me.

I do, indeed, try to stay away from the Net as far as possible (that is,
do nothing that is not directly related to making or saving money).
Therefore, please, report any problems with cypherpunks@algebra.com
to me directly.

As long as everyone uses distributed servers to receive the list traffic,
removal of the toad.com address will be quickly noticed.
