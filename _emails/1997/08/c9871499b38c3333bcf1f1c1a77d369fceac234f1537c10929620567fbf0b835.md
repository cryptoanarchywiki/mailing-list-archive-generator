	DENVER (AP) - Timothy McVeigh was formally sentenced to death
today for the Oklahoma City bombing after he quoted Supreme Court Justice
Louis Brandeis that the government "teaches the whole people by its
example."
	McVeigh, wearing tan khaki slacks and tan shirt, was animated as
he awaited the arrival of U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch, but turned
grim after the death sentence was handed down.
	He spoke briefly before Matsch formally imposed the
jury-sanctioned verdict.
	McVeigh quoted from a dissenting opinion written by Brandeis in
1928 in a wiretapping case, Olmstead vs. United States. McVeigh said: "He
wrote, "Our government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or
for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.' That's all I have,
Your Honor."
	McVeigh made his brief statement, which may have been a slap at
the government that prosecuted him, in rapid-fire, clipped tones. He did
not plead for his life or admit to any role in the bombing.
	Victims in the courtroom sat stone-faced and some stared angrily
as McVeigh made his comments.
	Outside the courthouse, prosecutor Joseph Hartzler warned
reporters, "Don't interpret his words as those of a spokesman or a
statesman."
	McVeigh's lawyer, Stephen Jones, said, "today is a solemn day of
judgment to follow through on the jury's verdict." He said he filed a
notice of appeal this morning.
