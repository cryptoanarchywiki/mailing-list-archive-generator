U-yep.  Gee, after all, he is running the country.  He should have SOME
responsability for his actions, especially when he fucks the whole country
by them.

swilling daft punk anarchist singing "Anarchy in the USA" and "God Save

It figures the murdering FBI agent would also be a drug dealer and have a
