Nice try but it was you who brought up the 14th in your original reply to
my message. An intresting debating technique present and argument then
blame your opponent for brining up that argument.

I once again shall quote the Constitution <sigh>:

Article. VI.


Clause 2:  This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which
shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall
be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme
Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any
Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary
notwithstanding. 


This trumps any argument you have made on this issue so far.
