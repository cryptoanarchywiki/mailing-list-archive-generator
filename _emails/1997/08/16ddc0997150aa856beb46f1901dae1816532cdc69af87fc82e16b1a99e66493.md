He should be up on 1st Degree Murder charges as these were a planned,
permeditated murders. Freeh, Reno, and Clinton should all be up on the
same caharges as co-consiritors for planning and ordering the murders and
for covering up the matter after the fact.

Of cource all 3 should be introduced to "'ol Sparky" for their part in the
murders at Waco.
