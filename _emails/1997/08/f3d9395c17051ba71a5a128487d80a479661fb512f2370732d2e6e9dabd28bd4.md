[yea yea, we've all seen multiple copies of this]

"X-day", in the credo of the Church of the Subgenuis, is
when the saved (people who have 'slack') are going to
be taken from the earth before it's destroyed, by 'pleasure saucers'
operated by Greys from Zeta Reticuli.  Or something like that.
Subgenius doctrine is hard to pin down since they're all
making it up as they go along.

X-day is supposed to be in 1998 some time, possibly April.
