I assume that messages of this type are some form of 
steganographic communication. I just wish that they 
were in alt.anonymous.messages: here they are just 
noise to most of us (though I suspect John Young 
parses them just fine :-).

At least they're more entertaining than Platypus'
'agraphic typo' technique.
