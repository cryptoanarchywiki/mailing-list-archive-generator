That's not nescessary, actually.  All you need is for the mint to put _no_
information at with the coin except it's serial number and a signatrue
(possibly a timestamp as well).  Voila, anonymity.  I was thinking of
implementing a low-cost server ofthis type, but there's the trust problem: this
nym is relatively new...

There might be other reasons for this:  have you looked at their _fees_???
Holy crap!  That's the only reason I don't have an account.  They're charging
top dollar for every aspect of a system that has it's only overhead in minimal
amounts of CPU time.  I was thinking of having my server charge only on
deposit of real money and only a tiny amount (like 1-2%).  I.e. no charge at
all to open an account to recieve money...
