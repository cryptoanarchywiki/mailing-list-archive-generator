Oops, I got the URL a bit wrong in my last posting. Here it
is again with the corrected URL.

For the last year or so, I have built and maintained a list of graduate
level courses on cryptography and security. The current list can be found
at 

   http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~rubin/courses.html

I would like to keep this list as current as possible, so if you have
any additions/corrections, etc, please let me know. I am only interested
in full-semester courses at universities.

Thank you,
Avi
