I'm tempted to go some sort of postage route myself, but I
occasionally get mail from newbies who have never written me
before, and who occasionally have something interesting to say.

Again, I will forward *ALL* my email to /dev/null before I kowtow
before some humongous list of offenders.

[Very Long List Snipped]

Additionally, a lot of mail is of the "This is the only mailing
you will receive from us" variety.  Getting 50 a day of those can
be royally annoying as well.

I am tempted to launch a few thousand packets in the direction of
any IP which sends me unwanted material trying to sell me
something.  If everyone did this, spamming machines would be
buried in a packet snowstorm within a few minutes of starting
operations.
