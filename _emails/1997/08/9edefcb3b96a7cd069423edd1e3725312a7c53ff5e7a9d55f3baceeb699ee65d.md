Well, I'm using version 4.01a for NT. There are three settings for 
cookies:

1. Accept all cookies.
2. Accept only cookies which get sent back to the originating server.
3. Disable cookies.

There's also a checkbox labled:

"Warn me for accepting a cookie."

I've been fairly unhappy with this version - the cookie management 
and the "Personal Toolbar" (user specified buttons for frequently 
visited sites) are the only new features that seem useful. It tends
to crash frequently, and the usenet news (aka "Collabra Discussion
Groups") seems to be broken (some of the earlier versions had a 
fairly useful newsreader). It's also a disk hog.

Note: This is a beta version.

PS: I have it set on 'disable cookies'.
