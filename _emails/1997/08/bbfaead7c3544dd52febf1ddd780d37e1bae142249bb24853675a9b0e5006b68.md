Excuse the crummy links, they worked when we were
hooked to the source but, it seems, not after disconnect. We
have not downloaded all the linked files, so here's the
routine to get them:

Log onto: 

   http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/aaces002.html

Highlight: "Privacy Act Issuances 1995 Compilation"

Enter: "cia" (with quotes) in the search slot, jack number of records up to
"100" and submit

83 records will be listed, and the links will work, just now confirmed it.

Repeat for "nsa" or any other federal agency.

Search also for "crypto*" (note * ) to see the cryptologic citations, 
which brings up a number of cites from CIA, NSA and others.






{% endraw %}
