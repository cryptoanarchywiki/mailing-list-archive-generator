Can you blame them?  They have a quote for writing parking tickets and will
get in trouble for not writing enough; while they don't have a quota e.g. for
writing tickets to the folks who run red lights, and can get shot at if they
try to.

As for the regrettable incident with the plunger: while it sounds bad out of
context, it can be viewed as just desserts for the indignities the while people
in New York City have undergone under the Dinkins administration.  If the
alleged victim (who already gave 3 highly contradictory stories of the events)
thinks that this city is so racist, why didn't he stay in his native Haiti?
