It does? You are without a doubt reading a different Constitution and Bill of
Rights than the one that I have. If you are making allusion to the 14th,
it only extends to privileges and immunities.

 
			       ARTICLE XIV. 
 
Section 1.  All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and 
subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States 
and of the State wherein they reside.  No State shall make or enforce 
any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens 
of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, 
liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person 
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. 
 
Section 2 to Section 5 deleted


So you equate your right to religion as a immunity or a privilige? Me
I take it as a right, something outside the legal purvue of the federal
government. An immunity or privilige is something that can be taken away by
the body granting it. Since the Constitution is a mandate from the people
it follows clearly that the only body that can change that mandate is the
people. If the state I live in has a constitution that allows it that is
between me and my state and none of you or your states or the federal
governments business.
