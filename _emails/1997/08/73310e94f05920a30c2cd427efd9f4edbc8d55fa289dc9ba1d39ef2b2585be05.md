  Sure, quit before we even have a chance to use the cheap shots we've
thought up since our last posts. Spoilsport.

  Me neither. I'm going to use email.

  It would probably be considered Politically Incorrect for me to
mention
that eye-shape might be a good indication, so I won't.
  Another indication might be whether your torturers are shouting,
"Confess!
You all an Ameliclan SPY!" or, "We kicked your ass in 'The Big One',
pal."
  If you haven't figured it out by the time you've been put completely
through the meatgrinder, you can still figure it out by noting whether
your remains are being mixed with rice and put in cabbage leaves, or
being coated with barbeque sauce and thrown on a grill.

  "Everybody needs somebody that they can look down on.
   That they can feel better than, at any time they please.
   Someone doing something dirty, decent folks can frown on.
   And if you can't find nobody else, then help yourself to me."

  It has been my experience that it is more fulfilling to be tortured by
CypherPunks than by Conservatives. <ymmv>
  (And the physical meetings are more fun, too.)
