	No, the federal government is barred.  The state governments
are free to do so (constrained by their own constitutions).  For that
matter, the federal government shouldn't be involved in the business
of affecting the specific welfare of individuals, so it should be a
moot issue.  But they cover everything by the commerce clause ("A bird
landing on your roof will travel between states during migration, so
we can regulate the construction of your house."), so they do it
anyways.
