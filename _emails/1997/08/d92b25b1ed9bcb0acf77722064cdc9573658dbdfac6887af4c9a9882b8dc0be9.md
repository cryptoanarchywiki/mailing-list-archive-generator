	WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department today closed its
investigation into whether the FBI's former deputy director tried to
obstruct an inquiry into the deadly 1992 seige at Ruby Ridge, Idaho,
saying it lacked evidence to bring criminal charges, governent officials
said.
	The Justice Department decided not to bring charges against former
FBI Deputy Director Larry Potts or Danny Coulson, Potts' deputy during the
1992 seige at the remote cabin of white supremacist Randy Weaver, said
government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 
The Justice Department informed lawmakers and lawyers for the FBI agents
that its review did not warrant any further criminal charges, but it left
open the possibility of disciplinary action.
	The department said in a statement obtained by The Associated
Press, "The available evidence does not support further criminal
prosecution of FBI officials ... from the August 1992 incident at Ruby
Ridge."
