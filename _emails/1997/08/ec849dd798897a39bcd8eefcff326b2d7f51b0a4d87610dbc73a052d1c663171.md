(This is a note I posted on the PKIX (Public Key Infrastructure) mailing
list.  I would be interested in comments on this document -- the draft is

>It seems to me that PKIX Part 3, section 2.2.2.1 "Centralised scheme"
>requires that a conformant implementation support the capability of
>generating the private key at the CA.  This means that a conformant
>implementation essentially is required to implement key recovery.

>I do not think that this conforms to IETF practice and I certainly do
>not want to require CA implementations to support this capability.
>If for some reason someone wants to implement this I can see it being
