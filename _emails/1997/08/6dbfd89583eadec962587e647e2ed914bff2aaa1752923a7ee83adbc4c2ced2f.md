That's some nice FUD to throw out.

Oh my, this is wonderful.

The reason that encryption isn't widely used is _directly_ because
of current government policy!!  They're using the results of their

"In order to have widespread encryption, we must restrict it"

"Ignorance is strength"

"Freedom is slavery"
