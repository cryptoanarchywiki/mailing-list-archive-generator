That is not true. While the german government may object to
US-escrowed software, they have no problem with GERMAN
escrowed-software. There are currently several proposals on the
"regulation" of cryptography in Germany, which are (suprisingly)
similar to US-plans, i.e. TTP's, key-escrow, and even the
possibility of outlawing "non-government-approved" cryptography.
