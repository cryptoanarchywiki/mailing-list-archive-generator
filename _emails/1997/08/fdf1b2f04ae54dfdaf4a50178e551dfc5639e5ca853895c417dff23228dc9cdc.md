Mallet cannot intercept the coin, because only Alice can unblind it.

Mallet cannot provide Bob with a number blinded by him, rather than
Alice, because Alice signed the blinded number

No he cannot, because only Alice can unblind the coin.

No one can ever discover the identity of Alice from the coin.
