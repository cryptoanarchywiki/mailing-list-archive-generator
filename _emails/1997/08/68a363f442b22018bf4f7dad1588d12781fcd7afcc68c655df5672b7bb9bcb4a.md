Here's an odd Ruby Ridge development, which just floated across
Reuters.

Idaho prosecutors have filed two sets of state charges against
persons involved in the incident.

Kevin Harris was charged with First Degree Murder for "killing
Deputy U.S. Marshall William Degan willfully and with malice
aforethought."

FBI Sniper Lon Horiuchi was charged with involuntary manslaughter
in the death of Vicki Weaver.

Shouldn't it be First Degree Murder for deliberately killing
someones wife with a baby in her arms, and involuntary
manslaughter for using possibly excessive force against an armed
attacker?

Seems a bit backwards to me.

I suppose it has something to do with that "only following
orders" thing. :)
