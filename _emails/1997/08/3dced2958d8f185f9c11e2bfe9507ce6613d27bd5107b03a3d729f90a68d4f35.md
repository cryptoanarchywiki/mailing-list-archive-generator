"Bad Luck" in this case means a bit more than simple thigs like 
"someone slipped me one at a party". Bad luck comes in many forms. 
Drugs aren't just a physical thing, they mess with your mind ass 
well. So among "someone slipped me one at a party" we should also 
count "I just got fired and my girlfriend broke up with me and 
everything just plain sucked for a while, and before I knew it I was 
addicted"

Well, I have news for you: It doesn't make them think twice. You only 
have to look around you to see the prove of that.

Most of them do not like the situation they're in. Try _really_ 
talking to some of them. The problem is that by the time they're 
outcasts from society, the only thing left in life that'll take away 
the pain (physical pain as well, from withdrawel) is the drug. Make 
these people feel part of society again, and they suddenly gain a lot 
of strength. Enough strength in many cases to enable them to give up 
the drugs or at least lower their consumption to a level where they 
can actually function again.

I'm not asking you to support them. I'm only saying that it would be 
that much nicer if we could help them get back on their own two feet.

They're not the drug addicts I talking about here. They're just, like 
you say, "kids looking for a little fun"
