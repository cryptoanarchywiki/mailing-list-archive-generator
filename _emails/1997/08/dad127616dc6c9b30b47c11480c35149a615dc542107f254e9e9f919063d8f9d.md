I've been a bit busy over the last few weeks and have been unable to get 
TSCM-L out until this week.

Making good progress on the TSCM textbook, should have a draft copy 
available around the end of the year as planned.

Here is an extract of a DOE report regarding the various technical 
surveillance devices and other technical security problems found at 
DOE facilities within the United States recently.


Bugs Recently Found in U.S. Department of Energy Facilities

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A telephone discovered in a DOE laboratory office was passing room audio while in the on-hook position. The phone was removed from the room by telephone maintenance personnel before an investigation could be initiated.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

During a TSCM survey of an office site for a DOE Operations Office, (previously occupied by DOE contractor management), a technical surveillance device was discovered. Workers removing the suspended ceiling tiles discovered a clandestine hardwired installation above the ceiling.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A contractor employee that police arrested was sitting in an illegally parked van equipped with electronic eavesdropping equipment. The man was seen using earphones and monitoring activities in the area of three restricted DOE buildings.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A LLNL research assistant was discovered in a restricted area after hours. An investigation revealed that the employee was installing a wired microphone system into the office of a scientist. The installation consisted of several hundred feet of wire carefully concealed behind a carpet tack strip along the floor.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A telephone repairman removed the cover of a telephone set to adjust the ringer and noticed a microphone mounted on the interior base of the phone. After the cover was removed, he also noticed a diode next to the lug terminals on the network block. Tests conducted on the instrument demonstrated that with the diode on the network circuit board, the telephone passed good quality audio with the handset in the cradle. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A similar telephone instrument was was also found that was passing very clear audio. This telephone was not connected to a line when discovered. There were no indications that classified discussions took place within the office identified.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Covert video cameras and microphones were found in a DOE womens shower and locker room area. An investigation revealed that video tapes from the cameras (of nude female employees) were being sold in local video rental stores in South Carolina. Investigators found that the recordings were being edited and sold by a DOE contractor employee. System was in place at least eight months.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sensitive meeting information at a DOE facility conference room was being passed to unauthorized personnel, possibly by way of a manipulated telephone or a listening device. Evidence at the site indicated the possibility that a hardwired microphone or tape-recording device had been removed just prior to examination.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

During a meeting with a DOE contractor employee, a Japanese national attempted to surreptitiously record the meeting. He was discovered with a body-worn tape recorder. The meeting, which was scheduled to cover reasons a specific Memorandum of Agreement was abruptly placed on hold.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A listening/recording device was discovered in a building at a DOE facility. The device was found in the administrative office of a shop manager, a contractor to the General Services Administration for DOE. The device was inappropriately removed by the office manager. Personnel involved in the discovery of the device thought it had been installed by a coworker who believed he was under investigation for possible theft of government property.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A DOE employee reportedly installed a telephone intercept device in a friend's apartment to determine if a privately owned countersurveillance detector was functioning properly. The device was hidden in the back of the living room couch located in front of the wall telephone jack. The DOE employee who resided in the apartment was unaware his friend had placed a device on the telephone line. He discovered the installation and immediately called the local police department, who responded and removed the device.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

During an physical audit of a classified DOE Local Area Network a spread spectrum repeater was found which was passing classified data between two SRS buildings without any type of encryption. The device had been inappropriately installed by a DOE scientist 18 months prior to allow access to "his old LAN from his new office".
