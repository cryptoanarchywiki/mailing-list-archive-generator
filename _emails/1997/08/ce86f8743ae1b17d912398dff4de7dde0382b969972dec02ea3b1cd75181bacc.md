Figures.

I've never understood this dumb Christian overlooking of how the world
actually functions.  You don't "stone" people to death anymore,
there's other ways to kill them.  Second, this "Pat Robertson" is a
fascist.

Something that should be spread, rather than destroyed, but narrow
minded Christians don't seem to get that.

Lead them away from opression, to freedom.  According to this guy, the
people who helped stike down the CDA are devils.

Also, this clearly shows that this man is a Nazi.

Fuck him.  God's word is fascism, hate, narrow-mindedness, and a Big
Brother State.  He can take his bible and shove it up his ass.

Sorry, we own earth, and God doesn't exist.

>>  "He has given us the Earth. He also warned

First of all, this also proves Christians are incabable of making real
world arguments, because they rely so heavily on a 1000-page book
filled with lies.

I'm not going to bother with cryptic messages sent by a god-loving
Nazi.

>>  "And you see, there is only one Word, and
>>  that is the Word of God:

Bullshit.

Mercy?  How merciful is commiting mass-murder because humans don't fit
your bill, god?

Second off, cryptic responses aren't worth a shit in arguments.

The word of the lord is fascism.

>>  "Can a demon appear as a slanty-eyed,
>>  funny-looking computer hacker?

No, but I see them all the time in tghe form of men wearing robes with
crosses on them, reading from a 1000-page book of lies.

As i said, they don't lure you away from god, they open your eyes, and
you grow up and stop the nonsense.

That is fascism.  Nazi fascism.

That's a clear violation of my rights, shoot that Christian prick.

Which is fascism.  Nazi fascism.  This loser makes Communism sound
good, considering it outlaws religion.

This post has moved me considerably.  Some parts of his speech
requires a response that words could not adequately describe.

This speech of his outlines in entirety the Christian Agenda. 
Enslaving, murder of those different, intolerance, fascism.

If Christians try to stone anyone, they should be shot right away.
