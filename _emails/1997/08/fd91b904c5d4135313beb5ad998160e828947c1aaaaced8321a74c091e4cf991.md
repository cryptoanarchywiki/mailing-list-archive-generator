In addition to famous deep pockets attacks on big corporations, 
for example the woman who supposedly lost her psychic powers
as a result of a CAT scan, or the silicone lawsuits, there is
also a significant business suing private individuals.

One particular vicious scam is the famous child molestation
accusation.  You privately agree you molested your child and 
pay $50 000 for "therapy", and provided you pay and cooperate
your admission will be kept quiet, or you are charged with ritual 
child abuse involving upside down crucifixes and the like.

Use the beef futures tactic:   Somebody placed a bet on beef going up.  
If it goes up, it was Tim's offshore corporation that bet on it.  If it
goes down, it was Tim that bet on it.  Gee, it seems that Tim has had
a run of bad luck in his gambling on the futures market.
