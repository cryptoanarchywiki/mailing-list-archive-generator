Bob's identity is only known by Alice if other aspects of their transaction
reveal it.  Ecash payments can be made out to "@", a wild-card ID which
allows anyone to spend it.  TCP/IP payments only provide the IP address not
the payee identity.  Payments made via message pools further obscure
identity.

Once MoneyChanger front-ends to the mints are available Bob can remain
anonymous to the bank as well.

>No one can ever discover the identity of Alice from the coin.

Unless the payment characteristics, e.g., large coin values, permit linkage.
