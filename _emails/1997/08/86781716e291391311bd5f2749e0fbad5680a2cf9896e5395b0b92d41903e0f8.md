 That's why the early filters were unacceptable to us.  You may not
like filters, but you have to admit, they have improved a great deal,
offering much finer granularity and configurability than before, and
improving all the time.

ROFLMAO!!!

Except they want to censor everyone based on their views, which is
tyranny.  That isn't noble.

I don't misunderstand censors.  They're Nazi bastards who enjoy making
the internet to fit their evil views and intentions, not caring what
the rest of free speechers on the net care.
