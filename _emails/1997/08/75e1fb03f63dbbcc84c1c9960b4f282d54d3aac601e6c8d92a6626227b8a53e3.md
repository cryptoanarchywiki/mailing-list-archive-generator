In a few years, when nearly every home computer is a laptop or other
portable.  The government will require that a similar service be installed
in every machine, (to cut down on theft).
A few years later, the government will demand open access to this database
(to track terrorists).
Even later, as nearly everyone will have a computer by this time, the
government will have an effective method of controlling the movement of the
population.
Why don't we just slap one of those radio transponders around our ankles
that some of the more stylish parollees already wear.
