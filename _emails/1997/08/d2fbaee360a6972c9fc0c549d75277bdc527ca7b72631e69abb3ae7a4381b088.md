Ever heard of mob violence?  Read up on the Salem witch trials when a bunch
of people got together and murdered a bunch of thier own on the evidence of
the rantings of a few girls.

Don't forget hitler, who managed to swing an entire country against a ever
growing list of minorities.  Granted, this was from within government, but
the principle is the same.

Anarchy is good, as long as an us versus them mentality doesn't occur.  That
would require a far more homogenious population than we have now.  If
everyone had the same skin color, hair color, eye color, bone structure, and
color of socks, war would eventually break out over who lived on which side
of the river.
