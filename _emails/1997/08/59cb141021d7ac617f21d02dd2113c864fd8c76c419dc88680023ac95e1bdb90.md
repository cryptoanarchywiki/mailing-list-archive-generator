    from the notice, access and contest requirements of the agency
    regulations and from all parts of 5 U.S.C. 552a except subsections
    (b), (c)(1) and (2), (e)(4)(A) through (F), (e)(6), (7), (9), (10),

    information and material in order to accomplish this law enforcement
    function of the agency, to prevent subjects of investigation from
    frustrating the investigatory process, to prevent the disclosure of
    investigative techniques, to fulfill commitments made to protect the
    confidentiality of sources, to maintain access to sources of
    information, and to avoid endangering these sources and law
    enforcement personnel. Section 12(c) of the Export Administration
    Act of 1979 also protects certain of this information and material
    related to export licenses from disclosure.
