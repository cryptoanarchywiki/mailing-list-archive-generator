Horrors.

Well, as I have often said, "There is no such thing as objective
market-driven journalism." As much as I admire Declan's
expository skills, we both know he isn't going to deliberately
bite the hand that is holding his paycheck.

Jim Bell is an example of an individual screwed by the government
using overly vague statues for alleged crimes which amounted to
little more than a few high school type pranks.

He took names of assholes who harrassed him, gave a made-up
number to a few people, and made the IRS doormat smell bad.  How
much, if any taxes, were evaded as a result of one of these
charges isn't even an issue.

It is in the collective interests of Crypto-Anarchists that
information depicting the government's true colors should be
available in a form which can be accessed by even the terminally
innumerate.  This means a hyperlink with the words "Jim Bell" on
it, in a frequently browsed location.
