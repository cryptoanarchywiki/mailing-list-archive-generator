Judge Patel has made her decision, and it is up on the Web at
http://www.eff.org/.

We're still preparing the legal analysis, but the basic outline is
that she declares the Commerce Dept. export-control scheme
unconstitutional.  She also issued an injunction against the Commerce
Dept. preventing them from enforcing these regulations against
Prof. Bernstein or others who distribute his software.

More details later...
