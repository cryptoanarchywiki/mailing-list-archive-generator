The nice thing about information dispersal is that each share is only 1/k
the size of the original.

The point of using information dispersal is not to defend the Eternity
servers, but rather the exit remailers.  Adam's Eternity servers do not
need to be defended because they only act as a gateway between USENET and
the web.  Clients can run Eternity servers on their local machine and
directly access their local USENET spool.
