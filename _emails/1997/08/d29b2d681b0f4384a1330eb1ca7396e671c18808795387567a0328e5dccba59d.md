  Why are these dinosaurs fucking away perfectly good taxpayer's money
trying to shore up the walls of a crumbling civilization?

NEWS FLASH!!!	THE GENIE *WON'T* GO BACK IN THE BOTTLE 
                ---------------------------------------
  Before the ink had dried on Judge Patel's ruling, 2,000,000 emails of
Professor Bernstein's work were on their way overseas, to every port of
call. (Courtesy of Email Blaster, that wonderful progam that tells us,
fifty times a day, how to "MAKE MONEY FA$T!!!")

  Hell, Professor Bernstein can _import_ it now!
  By September 8, the program will be obsolete, having been tweaked
upward
a few generations by Iraquian programmers. I respectfully requested that
the Iraquis make any future versions of the program available to
American
youth who have to flee to Hitler's homeland with their website in order
to avoid being persecuted for their sexual predeliction.

  No it doesn't. Haven't you heard of strong crypto?
  Thank you for pointing out that Phil Zimmerman wishes to protect me,
and Judge Patel wishes, on behalf of the government, to "eliminate the
protections" which strong encryptions affords me.

  The governement can't even protect themself, let alone the citizens,
as evidenced by the fact that the current sport of teenage hackers
across the nation is to send strong encryption overseas by way of the
government's email systems. (Can you say FBI? Sure you can! Can you 
say IRS? Sure you can!) Yet these dweebs want to destroy an industry 
that *is* capable of providing the citizens protection? (Considering 
the INSLAW affair, perhaps it would be more fitting to say "destroy 
_another_ industry.")

  I hope these idiots are having fun and making lots of money playing
their dinosaur games, because they are certainly accomplishing the
opposite of what they claim to be trying to do.
  The most that the dinosaurs in D.C. can manage to do, is to drag all
of the American business interests down into the ashes of history with
them as they attempt to build an Electromagnetic Curtain behind which
to imprison their citizens.
  Well, the CypherPunks were digging tunnels before the government even
knew they were predestined to build the Wall, so the fascist censors are 
sucking hind-tit and will, in all likelihood, continue to do so.
