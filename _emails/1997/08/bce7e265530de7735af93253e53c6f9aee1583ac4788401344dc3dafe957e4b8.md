We are now on eternity-0.08.  See:

	http://www.replay.com/aba/eternity/

and	http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/eternity/ for the software.

It's now much easier to install there are even some instructions on
what to do in the README.  There is now a configure script which
greatly simplifies installing.
