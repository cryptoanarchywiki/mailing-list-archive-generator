*** New service allows customers to track stolen PCs

Absolute Software announced Wednesday the CompuTrace Online Monitoring
Service, a new service that provides CompuTrace customers with various
PC monitoring reports via a private, secured Internet website.
Customers will now have access to the whereabouts of their PCs via the
Online Monitoring Service from any location at any time. CompuTrace's
technology silently calls in to the CompuTrace Monitoring Center on a
regular basis. The activity is reported to customers on a regular
basis, or via the new CompuTrace Online Monitoring Service. (PR
