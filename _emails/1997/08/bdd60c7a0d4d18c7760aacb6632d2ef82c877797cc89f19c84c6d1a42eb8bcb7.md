  A major thrust of the article deals with the government promotion
of the idea that the "bad guys" have actively declared war upon agents
of the U.S. government, on U.S. soil.
  Strange that this claim should come from a variety of sources at
the same time the government is facing the embarassment of having to
whitwash the actions of heavily armed, camouflaged Marines who felt
so threatened by a goat-herder with a .22 rifle that they slaughtered
him with their M-16's, despite the fact that the child was an American
citizen, doing what he had every right to do, on American soil.

  The drug cartels are having such little trouble getting drugs into
the U.S. that cocaine and heroine are cheaper than a bottle of good
Scotch, yet, according to the government, they have decided that it 
is necessary to perform actions which will "force" the government
to 'crack down' on border terrorism with increasing use of armed
force. Right...
  I bet the child pornography cartels are arming themselves, even 
as we speak, preparing to join the drug cartels in their war against
the U.S. governement. We'd better send some Marines to Denver, New
York City, and Fargo. Then everybody but the high-school goat herders
will feel much safer, I'm sure.
