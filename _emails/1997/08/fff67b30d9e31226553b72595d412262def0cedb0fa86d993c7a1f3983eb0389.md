Actually, I learned to read in Kindergarten, and can still read nicely.  I just don't contradict myself.

Funny that other cypherpunks don't try to censor me.  Most just delete crap that they don't want to read.  So what's your story?

Bullshit I did.  You speak lowly of remailer users, but you make and run remailers, or at least, you ran remailers.

Knee-deep in your censorous Nazi rectum with muskets, you Hitlerist bigoting bastard.

So in addition to being too coward to run remailers, you are also a censorous little prick, eh?  Don't tell me what to do, you fascist liar.

At least I'm not an inspiration for birth control, like you, Patty.  I'm surprised that your family didn't disown you at the first sign of a head coming out.

We need less Censor-happy Nazi cowards like you on this planet.
