* Paul Millhouse, 49, pleaded not guilty in February to assault on
an animal after he was arrested in Lakeside, Calif., near San Diego. 
He is suspected of being the man sought for 11 years for various
horse stalkings (the very first one of which was reported to police
by Joan Embery, the San Diego Zoo spokesperson who frequently
appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson). 
According to police in the latest incident, Millhouse was videotaped
entering a private pasture, taking off his clothes, and fondling a
horse.
