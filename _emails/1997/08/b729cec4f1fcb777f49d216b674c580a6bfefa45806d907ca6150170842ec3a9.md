They already make themselves less than human by their actions, not by
their identity.

Untrue, the victim remained human, the cop was inhuman in his treatment.
It doesn't matter what his thoughts were, his actions made him inhuman.

An eye for an eye, a toilet plunger for another.  That's the only true
justice there can be.

Distinction: cypherpunks don't want to control or take away your privacy.
Cypherpunks don't use toilet plungers.  Cypherpunks write code. :)
FBI should NOT exist.

Everyone.  Not in my world, but everyone's world.  The only law that
should exist is "do what you will as long as you harm none."  By harm I
only mean the following: physically (i.e. beat, kill, maim, etc.) and
property (i.e. theft, damage.)  Everything else is just excess bullshit.

There are a billion and one ways to harm a person physically.  You don't
need a billion and one laws to state that it is wrong.  One is sufficient.

Who does?  Who deserves less than basic human rights?  And yes, unlike the
scum that run the FBI, I include total privacy as a basic human right.
Just as important as the right to speak, think, or breathe air.

I understand your fears, but hating the enemy and knowing the enemy isn't
becoming it.  Revolutions aren't about taking over, they're about freedom
from the injustices done by the older regime.  Sure, in time the political
scum will rise to the top and another will be needed.  We've seen that
here already.
