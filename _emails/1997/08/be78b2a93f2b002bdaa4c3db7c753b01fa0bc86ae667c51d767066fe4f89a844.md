"The Magic Singing and Dancing Shift Register Algorithm" has been making
the rounds for a number of years now, and surfaces in various forms at
periodic intervals on the Net. 

It is based on a mathematical technique once used to do transcendental
function approximation on now slow and obsolete calculator chips, and as
far as I can tell, offers no magic insights into efficient ways of
computing cryptographically interesting functions, such as factoring,
descrete log, or symmetric block cipher key recovery.

I would put it in my comedy file along with the "RSA is Easy To Break"
paper, and similarly innumerate rants.

The book is probably a serious text on the mathematical techniques in
question.  But unless you are looking for a way to compute Trig functions
with lots of iterations and little hardware, it probably isn't worth more
than a cursory glance.  It's not going to break codes for you.
