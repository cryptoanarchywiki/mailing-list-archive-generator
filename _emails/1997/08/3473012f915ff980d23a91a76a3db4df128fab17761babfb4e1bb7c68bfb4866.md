Ah -- of course.

Of course, I am prejudiced, but I seriously think it qualifies as
legitimate art.  I spent a fair amount of time tweaking things so it
would sound good to my ear. 

Years ago I did a lot of experimentation with algorithmically
generated music -- it really grows on you.  In "the old days" of DOS I
had code that would drive a midi synth directly -- putting things to
midi files makes things static, and not quite as interesting -- I liked 
having things that never sounded exactly the same thing twice.  But I
haven't had time to keep up with midi drivers in the Windows world. 

But this experiment sends my mind twitching off in other aesthetic 
directions -- your code was short enough so that it isn't boring -- 
if you had 20 minutes of "music" like that it would drive you nuts, 
and I would like to try some longer things -- a couple hundred lines 
of C code, for example.  To make that work I was thinking of putting 
in a strong basic harmonic background, like a blues progression, and 
using the code text to drive a solo voice over it.  Something like 
the "Triple-DES blues"...
