THIS PROGRAM REALLY DOES WORK!</B>

***********We Will SEND 5000 E-Mails FREE************

Dear friend,

Do you realize hundreds of thousands of dollars are made each day by
way of the internet.  Haven't you ever thought "I wish I could find a
way to make money with my computer and my internet connection"?  
Well you can!  The internet is making it possible for everyday, ordinary people like you and me to make lots of money.  Many of you will read this and think "That can't work" or "It sounds too good to be true".  But I challenge you to discard traditional thinking and allow yourself the opportunity to make some of those thousands of dollars that are exchanging hands each and every hour.

The opportunity below is no scam and is very legal.  It is a simplified
form of email marketing using MLM techniques.  The first time I saw it I deleted it immediately. But the next time I saw it I figured I had nothing to lose with so very little investment required.  This is my 2nd time doing this program. The first time I did this I made very good money.  I decided to do it again but make it even better by sending out more mail.  Please at least read this as it may be the answer you've been looking for.  You certainly have nothing to lose.

"THINK ABOUT IT"

Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take
a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.  Get a pencil and
figure out what could happen when YOU participate.  Figure out the
worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will
still make a lot of money!  Definitely get back what you invested.  Any
doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in.  IT WORKS!

                                        Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>

It does not require you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave the house, except to get the mail.  If you believe that some day you will get that lucky break that you have been waiting for, THIS IS IT!  Simply follow the easy instructions, and your dream will come true!  This electronic multi-level marketing program works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME!
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Thousands of people have used this program to raise capital to start their own business, pay off debts, buy homes, cars, etc., even retire! This is your chance, so don't pass it up.
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY 
ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM</B>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
Basically, this is what we do:

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>We sell thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs us next to nothing to produce and e-mail. As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.  Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi- level business online (with your computer).
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The product in this program is a series of four business and financial reports.  Each $5.00 order you receive by "snail mail" will include the e-mail address of the sender.  To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.  <B>THAT'S IT!</B>...the $5.00 is yours!  This is the <B>GREATEST</B> electronic multi-level marketing business anywhere!
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY!</B>
Let's face it, the profits are worth it!  <B>THEY'RE TREMENDOUS!!!</B>
So go for it.  Remember the 4 points and we'll see <B>YOU</B> at the top!
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3><B>******* I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S *******</B>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
This is what you MUST do:

1.  Order all 4 reports listed and numbered from the list below.
    For each report send $5.00 CASH, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and YOUR
    RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to each person listed.
    When you order, make sure you request each SPECIFIC report.  You
    will need all four reports, because you will be saving them on
    your computer and reselling them.

2.  IMPORTANT--DO NOT alter the names, or their sequence other than
    instructed in this program! Or you will not profit the way you
    should.

    Replace the name and address under REPORT #1 with yours, moving
    the one that was there down to REPORT #2.  Move the name and
    address under REPORT #2 to REPORT #3.  Move the name and     address  under REPORT #3 to REPORT #4.  The name and address     that was under REPORT #4 is dropped off the list and is NO DOUBT     on the way to the bank.

    When doing this, please make certain you copy everyone's name and
    address ACCURATELY!!!  Also, DO NOT move the Report/Product
    positions!

3.  Take this entire program text, including the corrected names list,
    and save it on your computer.

4.  Now you're ready to start a massive advertising campaign on the
    WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB is very, very inexpensive,
    but there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise also.  Another
    avenue which you could use is e-mail mailing lists.  You can buy
    these lists for under $20/1,000 addresses.  START YOUR AD     CAMPAIGN  AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3><B>HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$</B>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Let's say you decide to start small just to see how it goes.  Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet could EASILY get a better response.)  Also assume that everyone else in YOUR BUILDING ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow this example for the STAGGERING results below.
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
1st level--your 10 members with $5                                      $50
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)                  $500
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)            $5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)      $50,000
                                 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4><B>THIS TOTALS-----------> $55,550<FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3></B>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Remember friends, this is assuming that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each.  Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone got 20 people to participate!  Some people get 100's of recruits!  THINK ABOUT IT!

By the way, your cost to participate in this is practically nothing.You obviously already have an internet connection and email is FREE!!! REPORT#3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists.
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>REMEMBER:  
Approx. 50,000 new people get online monthly!
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>  <I>ORDER YOUR REPORTS NOW!!!</I>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3>*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS*******</B>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY, so you will have them when the orders start coming in because:

When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal & Lottery Laws, Title 18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18, Section 3005 in the U.S. Code,also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state that "a product or service must be exchanged for money received."
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
*  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>*  Be patient and persistent with this program.  If you follow the instructions exactly                                                           the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESS!
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
*  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF THAT YOU CAN SUCCEED!

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******</B>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The check point that guarantees your success is simply this:
You MUST receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1!  THIS IS A MUST!  If you don't within two weeks, advertise more and send out more programs until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't, advertise more and send out more programs until you do.  Once you have received 100, or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because you will be on your way to the BANK!  -OR-  You can DOUBLE your efforts!
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
REMEMBER:  Every time your name is moved down on the list you are in front of a DIFFERENT report, so you can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching what report people are ordering from you.

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>NOTE:  IF YOU NEED HELP with starting a business, registering a business name,  how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local office of the Small Business Administration (a Federal agency) for free help and answers to questions. Also, the Internal Revenue Service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes.

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>        This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work, you'll lose a lot of money.  I'm living proof that it works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.  If you are a fellow Christian and are in financial trouble like I was, consider this a sign.  I DID!
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>                                        Good Luck & God Bless You,

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>P.S.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,500) looks like piled up on the kitchen table?...IT'S AWESOME!
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>        My name is Frank.  My wife Doris and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.  When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk mail"!  I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work.  Doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses.  Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was stunned.  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it
wouldn't work...I AM a believer now.  I have joined Doris in her "little" hobby.  I did have seven more years until retirement,  but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me...We owe it all to MLM.

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>        This is the only realistic money-making offer I've ever received.  I participated because this plan truly makes sense. I was surprised when the $5.00 bills started filling my mail box. By the time it tapered off I had received over 8,000 orders with over $40,000 in cash.  Dozens of people have sent warm personal notes too, sharing the news of their good fortunes!  It's been WONDERFUL.
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>                                        Carl Winslow Tulsa, OK

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>        The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time.  I was approached several times before I checked this out.  I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.  Initially I let no one in the organization know that I was an attorney and, to my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>                                Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>        This plan works like GANG-BUSTERS!!!  So far I have had 9,735 total orders...OVER $48,000!!!  I hope I have sparked your own excitement, if you follow the program exactly, you could have the same success I have, if not better.  Your success is right around the corner, but you must do a little work.
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>                                        Good Luck!  G. Bank

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>        Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that I am I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back.  Boy I was surprised when I found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders.  After that it got so over-loaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window.  I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before.  The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>                                Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>        This is my third time to participate in this plan.  We have quit our jobs, and quite soon we will buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money.  The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it.  For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity.  Remember, when you order your four reports, SEND CASH.  Checks have to clear the bank and create too many delays.  Good luck and happy spending!
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>                                        Charles Fairchild, Spokane, WA

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>        Typically when I look at a money-making deal I want to know if the company is strong, will it be here when it's time for my big pay off.  In this crazy thing there is no company intervention for management to blow it.  Just people like me ordering directly from the source!  Interesting...I had a couple of projects I'd been trying to fund to no avail so I thought; Why not give it a try?  Well 2 1/2 weeks later the orders started coming in.  One project is funded and I'm sure the other will be soon!
