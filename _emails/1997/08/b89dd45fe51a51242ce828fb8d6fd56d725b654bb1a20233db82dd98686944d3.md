Heh.  Every box would be running more than one copy, unless you
hacked the code to have some sort of lockfile that would let it
take turns occasionally.  (If you just lock the user out,
they'll take the trouble to go "fix" the code....)

Fortunately, crunchons are getting pretty cheap these days,
though the challenge would still lead to government people saying
"See, it took a million dollars and every university computer in the country
and they still haven't cracked Skipjack" or whatever the target is,
just as they've kept the "$10,000 and a supercomputer" figurefor RC4/40
going around.
