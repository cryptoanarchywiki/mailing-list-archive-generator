The number of machines working on DESCrack was probably in the 20-30,000 
range.

Actually, most participants worked without any expectation of getting 
the full $10k. DESChall gave the finder of the magic key $4k, the 
organizers $2k, with the rest going to charity. In the European 
effort, aside from a few hundred dollars to cover expenses, the 
entire amount would have gone to Project Gutenburg (as it did in the
48 bit RC5 crack). Only people running uncoordinated searches, such
as Mikkelsen's Bryddes or my Deskr, could look forward to receiving
the entire prize.

Interestingly, many of the European workers looked on the monetary 
award with disdain - they participated 'to show Internet user 
solidarity', and other such reasons. Also, many were using university
owned machines, and were legally constrained from accepting money 
earned from their use.

This came as quite a suprise to me. I had picked the $10k figure in my
proposal to RSA because it fell in the range of other prizes they had
offered, and seemed high enough to motivate people with no emotional
or ideological interest in the issues to run free software.

I think the effort would be better spent on a factoring challenge.
