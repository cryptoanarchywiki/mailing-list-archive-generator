See "The Machinery of Freedom" by David Friedman.  (Sorry if this is
old hat to you or other members of this list.)

Friedman's legal arrangement works something like this: Say you kill
somebody.  If you want to protect your life from revenge, you
immediately report what you did to three people nearby who were
uninvolved.

This keeps you inside the legal system.  Afterwards, a compensation
arrangement is made between your protection company and the protection
company of your victim.  This occurs within the legal framework.  If
you do not comply with the compensation agreement, you are outlawed.
Outlaws receive no legal protection.

You can change protection companies anytime you like.

Improbable?  This is very similar to the Icelandic legal system of
circa 1000 C.E.  Friedman claims that this worked quite well for many
years.  Icelanders at that time were murderous pirates, yet in Iceland
they murdered each other much less frequently than Americans do now in
the United States.

The compensation payments were typically nontrivial - on the order of
twenty years of income.

Some interesting aspects of medieval Icelandic politics: no prisons,
no standing army, no single political leader, and no taxes.
