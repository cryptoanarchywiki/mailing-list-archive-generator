Have your CPU fight for justice in it's spare time!

Some of the folks from the mitnick@2600.com mailing list have set up an
RC5 team in hopes of generating awareness about Kevin Mitnick's ordeal and
possibly some cash for his defense.

Details are at our site:

http://www.paranoid.org/mitnick/

The site has more info about Mitnick and the RC5 crack if you're not
familiar, as well as a gallery of graphics & banners you can put on your
own site to show your support.  We hope to have a stats page up soon.

We're registered at both www.distributed.net and www.cyberian.org ...
give us a hand!
