Maybe your remailing software could connect to a URL like this and
imitate the action of typing in mail.  But it might have to login
first.  Hotmail asks you to log out if you don't plan to use the
system any more for a while.  So it seems like it keeps some kind of
record of who is logged in.

A good project would be to make an exit remailer whose only job was
to choose from a random list of hotmail accounts and redirect mail.
It wouldn't have to have a lot of complicated cryptography, it would
just be for the last step.
