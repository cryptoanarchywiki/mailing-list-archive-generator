The children being "tramatized" is only a small part of this case.  If you
look at _WHY_ the kids were there in the first place, the lawsuit makes a
whole lot more sense.  (The family was being held against their will by
overreacting security guards after the family had been robbed in the
parking lot.)  But when you are an ex-mouseketeer, you can screw over the
security guards in court. (Unlike the usual "man-on-the-street" that gets
abuse by the mickey mouse guards.) 

I suggest reading what the real incident involves
<http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9708/19/mouseketeer.ap/index.html> instead of
relying on second hand reports.

If you want to make claims that the court system is screwed up, this is not
the best example.  You are ignoring the fact that the grandmother and her
grandchildren were held against their will.  But that does not make for
good rant, does it?
