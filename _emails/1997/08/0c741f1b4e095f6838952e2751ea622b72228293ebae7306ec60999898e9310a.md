The New York Times reports today on a declassified
CIA report on UFOs which discloses that over half
of the public sightings in the 1950s and '60s were lied 
about by the US Government to protect dark secret spy 
planes and programs, primarily those of the U-2 and 
SR-71. "The admission raised questions about other 
Federal cover-ups involving U.F.O.s."
