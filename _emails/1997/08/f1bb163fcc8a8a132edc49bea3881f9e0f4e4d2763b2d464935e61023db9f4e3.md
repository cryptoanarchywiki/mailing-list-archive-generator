Wasn't the UPS trying to promote some system of authentication (where you 
pay just as like you purchase postage stamps now) at a trade show of some 
description in the US this year or late last year? I recall a post on 
this to this list but can't recall the detail. Anyone recall the details 
of that post?

I know last year the australian post office suggested such a role for 
themselves and they didn't see it as a voluntary proposal. I haven't 
heard anything from them lately so maybe it was all just too difficult.
