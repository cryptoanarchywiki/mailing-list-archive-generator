  Don't write an affidavit, write an indictment.
  Say, perhaps, an indictment of our founding fathers for their use of
anonymity,
as well as tacking a "use of crypto in commission of a crime" charge on
to the
indictment.
  You can site Paul Revere's use of cryptography ("one if by land, two
if by
sea) to implicate the whole bunch in a drug dealing child pornography
ring.
Perhaps you might even want to trace the founding fathers' use of
anonymity
and strong-lantern encryption to the moral corruption existing today.
