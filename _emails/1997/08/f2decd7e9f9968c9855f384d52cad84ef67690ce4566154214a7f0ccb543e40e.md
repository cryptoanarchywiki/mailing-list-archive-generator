This is a 100% hypothetical situation, though would be interesting to see
if it is possible.

A company does some R&D work, which it wishes to keep classified from
competitors.

However, they have two main offices on opposite sides of the country.

Not wishing to use sneakernet type file transfer, they wish to pass
confidential material from one network to the other using the Internet.

Now we all know that anyone with a little bit of knowledge can intercept
the packets as they go past and read the information.

Email is out, as they do use a system of file mirroring, keeping each set
of data as a backup as well as for usage.

Would make sense for them to use a type of NFS system, but is there an
implimentation of secure (ie: encrypted) NFS available?

OS doesn't really matter, as it is a hypothetical system, but we'll assume
either some form of unix/linux, or perhaps winNT or novell NetWare.

Thanks in advance for the info and knowledge...sorry if it's been asked
before.
