A black man holes up in his car, shooting at a white cop wearing the
same uniform as the guy who shoved a toilet plunger up his ass the 
day before.
The cop shoots back, fearing that the black man is a drug dealer who
will molest his children, plant a bomb on an airplane, and evade
taxes.
Both men are shooting, both fear for their lives, and both hate
what the other man represents in their mind and life experience
and would like to see him dead.

The Jap picks them both off, from a rooftop, and lives happily
ever after.
