Well you are complicating the issue by assuming that we are in two
different states. If you and I are citizens of the same State you do not
have the right to deny me my rights protected under the Constitution of
the United States of America regardless wether you are in the majority
view or not. Of cource the laws of one State do not have power over
another State.

I do not consider the Bill of Rights as giving me "privileges" but giving
me immunity from any government restricting those rights.


Article. IV.

Section. 2.

Clause 1:  The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to
all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States. 


Section. 4. The United States shall guarantee to every
State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect
each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the
Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened)
against domestic Violence. 


Article. VI.


Clause 2:  This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which
shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall
be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme
Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any
Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary
notwithstanding. 


I think that this clause more than any other shows exactly where the
States stand. So long as a law passed by Congress is in accordance with
the Constitution the States are obligated to obey such laws regardless of
the Laws & Constitutions of the States.
