An early member of the Eric Conspiracy Research Labs, Eric Blair, correctly
noted the abuse of language that is necessary to make anything go down with
minimum fuss...

Don't cry for me, Canada.

It was also obvious to me several years ago that things would reach a point
where everyone could see what was coming. The curare of the government has
of course paralyzed many.

Nothing left but the shooting.

(I have been arguing that CFP shut down their pointless conferences...the
same old same old repeated every year. Alas, they are still planning their
big shindig in Austin next year. )

However, there is a progress toward an industry-friendly consensus on the
export of IG Farben's products: Farben will receive Most Favored Gasser
status in exchange for assisting with the Legitimate Needs of Law
Enforcement.

Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
