  I am happy that Kent has finally realized the need to Monkey Wrench
the "system" to the point where enough citizens get off of their too-
comfortable asses and address the issues which are leading to an
increasing number of their fellow citizens being persecuted and fucked
over by the government.

"Then they came for the fat-asses, and I was a fat-ass, but nobody 
spoke up."

break a few eggs."
        -Janet Reno/Pontius Pilate

  Now that Kent has realized, like McVeigh, that "it has to get worse 
before it gets better," perhaps he is ready to break the Big Egg.
  I'll be more than happy to chip in to fill Kent's private plane with
fuel, and Peter Trei is at the airport, right now, stripping the
identifying numbers off of Kent's aircraft. (Ever since he started
forging posts to the list, Peter's gotten really radical.)
