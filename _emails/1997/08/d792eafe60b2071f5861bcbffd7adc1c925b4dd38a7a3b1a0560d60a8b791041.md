Nazi Fascism at work.  Legalized thugs, the NEW brownshirts.

All that shit to arrest some guys who may or may not have taken things from graves???  Someone explain to me how we need to have people with Automatic Weapons arrest some guys for a trivial crime?  Nazi Fascism at work.

You've gotta be shitting me.  Forest Rangers with Automatic Weapons????? I'd hate to see what they'd do to a guy lighting a match in a forest camping ground.

This incident demands armed rebellion and government overthrow.  It demands people going to parks to carry automatic or semi-automatic rifles.

If this isn't pure evidence of preparing a takeover of fascist forces, then i don't know what its.

This is another big leap past what our Founders intended.

Then it's time for all citizens of this country who love freedom to form a militia, controlled by citizens.  Arm yourselves.

If necessary is another double-talk bullshit term meaning carry weapons dangerous to freedom-loving citizens everywhere.

And some beaureacratic bullshit along with Fascism.

Someone PLEASE bump off Bill McHitler.

He's the same jackass that was proposing the "Dangerous Predators" bill jailing kids with adults.

Why not go ahead and just for ministries of Peace, Truth, Plenty?

It's time we the people started doing the same.

Don't forget interrogation beatings, and illegal search and seizures.

And they wonder why the Davidians were armed to the teeth.

Also purposes include fighting strong crypto among citizens, and threatening makers of crypto.

That's why we need to have MORE citizen militias then EVER.

If I start seeing postal agencies with swat teams I'm joining a militia.

As I said, Nazi Fascism, and usurping of freedom.

I'm increasingly astonished at the rate we citizens lose military weapons.

>"The machine-gun is an indiscriminate weapon, and is singularly

Yes, horrifying that soon it will lead to Dictatorship.

>In full agreement is Greg Lojein, legislative counsel for the American

There is a constraining mechanism, bombs and military rifles in the hands of citizens.

Well, the Feds are above the law anyway.

War against citizens.

>"The last thing people want to see is a tank on a city street," he said.
>"That's what you expect to see in Bosnia, but not in Boston."

Time to see more bomb-throwing freedom fighters here in America.

Nazi Fascism at work.

It's time to rebel.

>incentives to become armed and dangerous.

Many citizens have been given the incentive to make themselves armed and VERY dangerous to fascism loving nazis like Clinton and Freeh.

<sarcasm>Obviously, a dangerous crime to society.</sarcasm>

>None was found. There, as at

Stealing land from citizens for use by the rulers.  I'm telling ya, it's FASCISM.

>6,500-acre ranch -- which covers 10 percent of the island. The Nature

Seize it for what?

The time has come for all people to revolt with weapons; bombs, guns, knives, and anything that can kill Fascist Nazis and their supporters.  Aquire weapons, form militias, retake the country.  It's time to reinstate Democracy.

If this continues, we're going to see more Oklahoma Cities.

Arm yourselves, arm your neighbors, arm freedom lovers.  Fight Fascism.  That is the ONLY answer.

And they still wonder why McVeigh said "Enough!!!"

FreedomMonger
"There's something wrong when Ranger Rick gets and automatic weapon, and Federal agencies become blurred with the Military."
