And even then one must never trust it completely.  An appropriate degree
of paranoia means that not only must one use all the appropriate tools and
techniques, but that one must be prepared for the possibility that the
tools may fail.

Following is a fairly obvious scenario, but still perhaps interesting:

Imagine that an agent X wants to find out the real identity of
somebody posting under the pseudonym A.  X can retrieve the list
membership through the mailserver.

X composes a post to the list designed to elicit a response from A,
perhaps flaming A, or criticising something dear to A.  They prepare n
variations of the post by inserting different spacing, spelling, or
phrasing and keep track of each variation.  They post one variation to
each member, relayed through toad.com.

If X is lucky, A will reply to the post (not noticing the slightly
unusual header), quoting some of the original matter.  By looking at
the spelling etc in the quoted part X can determine which original
version A received and hence what address they use to read the list.

Now this is by no means certain to work: A might not reply, they might
not quote enough material to allow the original to be identified, or
they might notice that the mail is not really from the list.  Even if
X can associate the reply with an original, they have no really
conclusive evidence, but then...

It has, perhaps, only a ten percent chance of success, but this is
nevertheless significant.  If A is posting anonymously just for the
convenience of not having his/her email address dredged up by search
engines, or from broadly-based monitoring this is perhaps OK.  If A
writes against people or governments that might retaliate, then A
should at least consciously accept the risks.

Nicely put.

That's good to know.  Some of them need to be watched.
