There are two lists, or more properly one list - the remove list.  The
"ON" list is whatever cyberbomber or emailblaster, etc. generates.

They are supposed to run the outbound mail through the remove list filter.
And take action against anyone who doesn't.

All returned numbers give the same effect.  One day that changed from "The
token you entered was invalid, try again or restart with your name" to
"That user id removal is already in progress - please try again in 24
hours".
