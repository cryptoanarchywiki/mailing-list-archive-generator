Boy, you're a fucking loser.

Hacking = expert/geeky computer usage.
Cracking = breaking into computer systams.
Phranking = some stupid fucking word you made up.
Cryptomography = some other stupid fucking word you made up.

So, you use 4 major terms, get two of them wrong, and can't use basic grammar.
Even if I know the first thing about cracking (which I don't), I would never
teach you that or anything else in a million years because you are obviously too
stupid to be worth wasting my time on.

Hell, you're even too stupid to troll well, if that's what this is...
