                    "Central government spending had
                soared from less than 2 percent of the economy's total
                output to well over 20 percent in 1865, approximately
                what the central government spends today.

                     "It is hard to decide from which angle that statistic
                is more astonishing: that government spending rose
                from such infinitesimal lows to today's heights in four
                years, or that today federal authorities regularly spend
                during peacetime as much as they did during the
                country's most devastating war."  -- Jeffrey Rogers
