THIS EMAIL IS NEITHER AN OFFER TO SELL NOR A SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER
TO BUY THESE SECURITIES.  THE OFFERING IS MADE BY THE U-7 DISCLOSURE
DOCUMENT ONLY.

All securities are offered through Intrepid Securities, Inc., 
Torrance CA. Intrepid is a member of the NASD and is SIPC insured.  

Gasmaster International, Inc. is a leader in magnetic field technology 
to create turbulence within the flow of fuel with it's patented Fuel 
Flow System.  This turbulence increases the burning efficiency of the 
fuel, which results in improved fuel economy and a reduction in 
emissions.  Gasmaster has Fortune 500 clients with applications from 
boilers to diesel engines.  

The GASMASTER Fuel Flow System (FFS) was evaluated recently by 
Hawthorne Machinery Co., the San Diego Caterpillar dealer. It was 
tested on a Caterpillar 3406 B engine in a Class 8 Peterbuilt
Tractor. The vehicle is used daily to deliver equipment in their 
Rental Division.

During the 28-day test period the vehicle accumulated 4,060 miles 
with the following results:

               13% better fuel economy
               26% reduction in opacity 
                   (the black stuff coming out of the exhaust)

Overall, the worldwide market for the GASMASTER(r) Fuel Flow System 
is considered to range well over $1 billion dollars within the 
major industrial markets alone, with major extensions in consumer 
applications also possible.

The minimum investment is 300 shares at $2 per share ($600).
