	No one chooses to have the wind blow. If a junkie can 
demonstrate how he became hooked by force, or by accident (i.e. "someone
slipped something in my drink over and over"/medical usage leading to 
addiction), then I will not blame them as much. I know what it is like to 
kick an addiction, and I can just imagine how much worse Herion, Coke, and 
Speed are, but hey, it's your life, you own it, do what you have to.

	It may not solve _his/her_ problem, but it may also make a couple 
of younger kids think twice before shooting up.

	Assuming that they _want_ to get treated.

	If they hold down a job, pay their own way, I could care less, and 
don't mind a bit. 

	I don't want to support them.

	Crap. There are kids in small towns all across the USA doing Coke, 
Speed, Pot, and LSD. They aren't "escaping a painful reality", they are 
just fucking bored and looking for a little fun.
