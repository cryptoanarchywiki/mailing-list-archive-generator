I am an ex-lurker of this mailing list that is not currently subscribed (so 
make sure I am in the To: or CC: list :).

I wanted to ask the experts on the quality of OpenSoft ExpressMail and how 
it compares to competing products such as PGP for Personal Privacy in terms 
of

security and algorithm's used
ease of use, integration and installation
interoperobility, compatibility and use of standards
OS and e-mail platform availability
export laws (OpenSoft's programming team is in Russia)
etc. (is there something I should know?)

If anybody has an opinion, or a pointer it would be greatly appreciated.
