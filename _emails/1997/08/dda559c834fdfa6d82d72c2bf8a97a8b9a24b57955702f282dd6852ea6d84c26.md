Not very different from how one might handle a gold-denominated and backed
ecash coin.  Real gold must be stored in a repository which charges a
storage and handling fee.  This can integrated with the coin value by
applying a negative interest rate to the coin based on the epoch in which
the coin is issued.  So coins are redeemed at a lower than initial value
(assuming no change in the gold value figured in whatever unit it is being
exchanged).
