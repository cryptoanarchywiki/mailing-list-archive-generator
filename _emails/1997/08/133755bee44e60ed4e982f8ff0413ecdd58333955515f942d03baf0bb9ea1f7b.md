|Well, I can't.  It's very confusing.  Are there judges in your
|philosophy, or do you just decide for yourself who to shoot?
|
|"You walked on my property."  BANG.
|
|"Your music kept me awake all night."  BANG.
|
|"I warned you to cut that tree down, and now it fell on my house."
|BANG.
|
|
|Or how about escalation:
|
|"You raped my daughter"
|
|"No way, she wanted it as much as I did"
|
|"That's not what she tells me.  You die."  BANG.
|
|
|"You shot my son"
|
|"Bullshit, he had it coming after what he did to my daughter."
|
|"Bullshit yourself."  BANG.
|
|
|"You shot my pa"
|
|"He shot my son"
|
|"You're gonna die."  "I'm taking you with me then."  BANG.  BANG.
|
|BANG.  BANG.  BANG.  BANG.  BANG.  BANG.  BANG.
|
|
|You know, there's a reason people started using judges to help
|settle disputes.  There's a reason the common law evolved with the
|idea of proportionate response and restitution.  This kind of
|shoot-everybody-I-think-harmed-me approach just doesn't work.
|Nobody knows what someone else will consider harm worth shooting
|over.  If somebody disagrees that a shooting was justified, they'll
|shoot back, and feuds begin.
|
|The current system stinks, but your idea is no better.
