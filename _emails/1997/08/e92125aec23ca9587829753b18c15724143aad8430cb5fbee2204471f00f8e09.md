	It is?  It seems to me that military force is military force,
regardless of what uniforms it's dressed in.  I forgot that it's so
much nicer to be shot by the New Jersey National Guard than the US
Marine Corps.  And Washington sent in the militia only because he
didn't have enough 'regular' troops.

	Agreed.  Has anyone ever attempted to sue the US Army as being
unconstitutional, given the prohibition of a standing army?

	Ah, Congress had to pass a law to ban it, eh?  Well, what
Congress giveth, Congress can taketh away - and did.  I don't recall
the exact law or bill, but they exempted the military from the Posse
Comitatus Act in one of the 'War on Drugs' laws.

	At any rate, the 'War on Drugs' is a bad idea, and the use of
the military as police, domestically or abroad, is a bad idea.  I'm
just not certain which is worse.
