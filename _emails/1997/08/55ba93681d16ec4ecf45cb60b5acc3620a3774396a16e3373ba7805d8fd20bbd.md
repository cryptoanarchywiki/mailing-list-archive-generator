Following the the ruling of the High Court of Australia finding that
billions of dollars in taxation revenue collected by the states was
illegal and unconstitutional the Premiers of Victoria and NSW have
made statements that their respective governments will not be
refunding the unlawfully collected taxes paid in advance by certain
hoteliers. To do so would be an unjust windfall the Premiers said. The
governments continue to act unlawfully collecting 'taxes' with no
lawful or constitutional basis.

The government of Queensland today in a press statement advised it
would be returning any unlawfully imposed taxes paid in advance.

No mention was made of any intention to refund taxes previously
collected but not paid in advance.
