ROTFL.  (Well, not literally, but smiling.)  The "How it works" link on
their site is broken :-), so what they're basically saying is "here is
some encrypted text, I bet you can't crack it."

Idiots.

Saying that one-time pads are secure is meaningless.  Their web site
doesn't even mention key exchange.

As the Preface to Advanced Cryptography (www.counterpane.com) says,

% If I take a letter, lock it in a safe, hide the safe somewhere in
% New York, and then tell you to read the letter, that's not
% security. That's obscurity. On the other hand, if I take a letter
% and lock it in a safe, and then give you the safe along with the
% design specifications of the safe and a hundred identical safes with
% their combinations so that you and the world's best safecrackers can
% study the locking mechanism--and you still can't open the safe and
% read the letter, that's security.

I'm sure everybody here already knew this, but anybody with a million
bucks and no clues at all deserves to be kicked.

I must disagree... they could be a liar _and_ stupid.

Somebody ought to forward this thread to his creditors...
