Most of us aren't trying to "ban" labels, or suppress or oppose them, per se.

Just to ban, suppress, and oppose:

- any scheme to require them

- any scheme in which labels are an "affirmative defense"

- any "mandatory voluntary" schemes

- any moves to legislate or dictate the forms labels may take
