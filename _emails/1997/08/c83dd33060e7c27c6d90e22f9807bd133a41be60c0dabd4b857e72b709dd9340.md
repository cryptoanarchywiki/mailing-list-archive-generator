The author who claims that is St. Jude, AKA Judith Milton, she is a former
UNIX programmer who is also absent from the MUT home page.

The book itself is a little large for a paperback version, you have to read
the warning about the broken "scrapbook" method and remember that these
people are humor writers.

I grabbed a copy probably 3 months after it was released.  The dust cover is
very flimsy, has it improved?

There is a web site dedicated to the book, HTTP://www.onworld.com:80/MUT
The site is a shambles right now but I was told that they were going to try
to salvage it after the holiday weekend.  When it is working it has a nice
web-based bulliten board, with some threading, and way too many "how do I
hack" questions.  There are a few good gems and some people very much in
line with those here, however.

It's worth a visit, but give it a little while and see if they get the
bulliten boards back on line.  It is over 18 months old, I have been
visiting it off and on for about a year.
