So if someone posts a few lines of source code to coderpunks, the
government reserves the right to prosecute, unless the poster's name is
Daniel Bernstein, and the algorithm is Snuffle 5.0.  The judge seems to be
saying "I think Bernstein's case has merit, so I will order the government
to stop hassling him, but since I am too chickenbleep to challenge the
unconstitutional usurpation of power on the part of Clinton, Congress, the
State Dept., and the Dept. of Commerce, I will pass the buck and let the
issue be decided on appeal."  The decision seems to be a step in the right
direction, but a VERY small one.

What part of "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed" is too hard to understand? (From 2nd Amendment, U.S. Constitution)

When everyone is armed, criminals fear everyone, not just the police.
