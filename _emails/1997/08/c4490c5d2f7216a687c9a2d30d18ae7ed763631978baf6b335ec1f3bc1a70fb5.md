Declan is absolutely right. Good thing there are no real
privacy officials in the federal government and no privacy
laws for the Internet to get in the way of these efforts.

Has anyone else noticed that the most sweeping proposals
for surveillance are coming from the administration that
has backed the fewest privacy laws of any administration
in 30 years?

Mere coincidence? I don't think so.

Marc.
