Whatever you do, don't interpret what some are saying on this issue at "the
view of Cypherpunks.

In my view, the arrest, detention, and internment in concentration camps of
persons of putative or confirmed Japanese ancestry was a slam dunk
violation of their constutional rights (specifically, I presume, of their
4th and 14th ("equal protection") rights.

That a "foreign entanglement," which Washington warned of, was happening
between mostly Caucasian soldiers and mostly-Mongoloid soldiers over trade
routes and colonies was no constitutional justification for these arrests
and detetentions.

And once released from these concentration camps, redress in the courts was
not possible. (Token redress was made decades later.)

The Japanese should have formed underground cells to track down and execute
those who stole their property and their freedoms. We think killing SS
arrest battallions is what the Jews should have done, so why not the same
for the battallions assigned to ship these persons to America's
concentration camps? It's still not too late. Strong crypto will make this
very possible to coordinate and carry out.

The Jews are always clamoring for Nazi criminals to be tracked down,
kidnapped, and tried, a la Eichmann, so why not the co-conspirators in this
case?

Of course, like the Jews, few Japanese were armed at the time. And even
fewer after the war (hint: any rifles or handguns they owned at the start
were _not_ returned to them in 1945.)

Other ethnic groups are less easily placed into concentration camps. Let
the fascists try putting Koreans into concentration camps, and some of
those AR-15s they used so well on the rampaging blacks and Hispanics will
kill some cops and soldiers.

Like the Jews in Europe, the Japs were just too fucking timid and
well-mannered.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
