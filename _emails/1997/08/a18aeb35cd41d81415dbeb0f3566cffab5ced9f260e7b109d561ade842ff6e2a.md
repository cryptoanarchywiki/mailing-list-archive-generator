  I am unclear on something.
  Did the government imprison without bail a citizen who evaded taxes
and made a government office smell bad, or did the government allow
a terrorist who was actively plotting to overthrow the government
to plead guilty to inconsequential charges?

  If I get arrested for plotting to Nuke D.C., should I hire Bell's
lawyer and try to get it reduced to jaywalking? Or should I avoid
jaywalking to prevent getting arrested for plotting to Nuke D.C.?
