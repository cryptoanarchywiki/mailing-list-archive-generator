Or what do you do about bugs?  It mentions corrections, but not who to
send them to.

On DEC Alpha/axp under Linux, include/pgpUsuals.h has a test for a big
ULONG_MAX that defines HAVE64 as 1 on 64 bit machines like the alpha

But the very next test has #ifndef HAVE64 where there is a typedef for
word64, which won't happen.  But if HAVE64 is 1, in pgpMD5.c it will
really want word64 defined or it will bomb. 

Something is wrong, but if I copy the typedef, it seems to get further
(compiling as we speak - the old UDBs aren't the fastest alphas).

Now, where should I send this information or the patch?
