	Large numbers of small wins may be more likely to draw in
cycles than single large prizes.  This is because as a small player
I'll go after the $100 prize that I can win daily over the $1M prize
that I can win yearly.  The odds against the $1M prize are too high.

business model, software to ship by year end.
