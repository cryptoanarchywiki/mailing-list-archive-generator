Yep, these are a lot of the things I've become a felon for. Funny thing,
none of these things are "crimes" against my neighbors in any reasonable or
common sense way. None of these felonies involve killing my neighbors,
stealing what is theirs from them, raping their daughters, or even
trespassing on their land. The crimes are against some nebulous, Big
Brotherish sense of "standards.

I'm not in this database, and every year I pick a different "occupation" on
my IRS forms. So far, I've not been contacted by the TP on this one.

I plead nolo contendre on this one.

I'm a major felon in Kalifornia on this one, though they haven't charged me
yet. Talk about ex post facto...the law requires that I provide proof about
the dispostion of AR-15s, Valmets, and other assorted "assault rifles" that
I bought and sold (and maybe cached in safe places) years ago. I'm a felon
for not having gotten forms filled out in 1980 that weren't mandated at the
time! Like most others who bought such guns, my attitude has been "Fuck
you. Trespass on my property and I shoot to kill."

(And there's still a flourishing market in black market guns. The Feds have
no justification for gun registration, waiting periods, etc.)

Yeah, like the guy stopped for speeding as he entered the magic "1000
yards" range of a school--at night, no less. The cops searched his car,
found a gun, and charged him under this new felony provision of the gun
laws.

(And they have the nerve to wonder why McVeigh said "Enough!!!")

Under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1995, several groups I am linked to are
probably "terrorist" groups. Even donating time or money to groups
interested in the destruction of the illegal Zionist Entity meets this
criterion.

( I have nothing against Jews. Kind of a funny religion, with the silly
hair and all. But harmless. However, the notion that Jews born in Europe
and having European ancestors for 300 or 500 or whatever years, and
"native" ancestors, too, could consult their "Book" and conclude that Arabs
and Palestinians with actual title and possession to land in Haifa,
Jerusalem, etc.  could and should be kicked off and told to go live in
refugee tents in the desert...well, the State of Israel must be destroyed,
and I am proud that unbreakable crypto is helping the "terrorists"
accomplish this. Under Klinton's laws, this makes my support of Cypherpunks
actions a "terrorist act." Read the law.)

Like the guy who had his guns taken away because his psychiatrist decided
he was a "threat" of some sort....and he was only seeing the shrink because
the courts ordered it as part of a "mediation process" in a divorce case.

Shades of the U.S.S.R. and its psychiatric hospitals. "Anyone who believes
the government is out to get him is obviously delusional...he cannot be
allowed to own weapons of any sort."

A nice racket, eh? No doubt Jefferson and the other Founders would be
interested to learn that the State had figured out a way to disarm anyone
who might ever be a threat to their actions. So much for Jefferson's
revolution every 20 years.

Yep. So what else is nu?

(Nu...E over h...the defining equation of the fireball which will take out
these statists in Washington, Tel Aviv, and the other fascist imperial
capitals.)

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
