Subject: Want to help put Judge Patel's decision on the web?
Message-ID: <199708292351.QAA23568@toad.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain



We tried running it through OCR software and the results were
worse than just typing it in.

So we're asking for your help.

Please pick a random page of the document and type it in as ordinary
text.  We'll proofread it and fix up the strange characters and such.
Mail the result to me (gnu@toad.com) and post a one-line note to
cypherpunks that says "Patel decision page XX handled".  If a few get
typed twice, it'll be useful for proofreading anyway.

The document is on the Web at
http://www.eff.org/pub/Legal/Cases/Bernstein_v_DoS/Legal/970825_decision.images
We reworked the original fuzzy images so they're much easier to read
now.  But that's still no substitute for real, searchable, small,
ordinary text.

Please type it like this:

  *  Break the lines in the same place as in the original text.
  *  That funny "S-like" squiggle translates as "Sec." (for section).
  *  That funny "P-like" squiggle translates as "Para." (for paragraph).
  *  Any other stuff you don't understand, do your best, then add "XXX",
     which we'll search for and fix up.

Thanks to everyone who helps!

	John
