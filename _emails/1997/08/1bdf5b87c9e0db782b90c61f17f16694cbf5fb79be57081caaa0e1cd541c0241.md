If you merely point to someone else's content, I don't see how you
can possibly be found to have violated their copyright.  The "linkee"
site is the one publishing the information guarded by copyright, not
the "linker" ("publish" == to desseminate or make available to the
public).  IMO, you don't even need to cite "fair use" for this;
*you're* not publishing it, they are.  This is just an intimidation
tactic.  (Of course, if they have lawyers and money and motivation,
and you don't, it may very well work.)

BTW, do you have an URL to the Brad Templeton piece?
