Um, as soon as you broaden AP from libertarian fantasy into 
rigorous hypothesis, it turns out that it _isn't_ _anything_
but Idea Futures/insurance/ABPs/(payee-anonymous) contract 
markets plus the murderous daydream junk.


That is to say, from the rigorous (technical) point of view, 
AP _IS_ Idea Futures _IS_ ABPs _IS_ contract markets _IS_ 
insurance.


TCMay has mentioned before that AP is nothing new...


If you want some scholarly exposition, write up some definitive
treatise on AP/IF/I/ABPs/CMs as such so that in the future 
crackpots who semi-independently come up with the idea won't be
able to tie it to political fantasies or other specific 
would-be-applications in the (un-)popular consciousness.


Zooko, whose prose is JYA'ifying in frustration

P.S.  Allow me to repeat in simple words:  "'ASSASSINATION 
POLITICS' IS NOTHING BUT IDEA FUTURES PLUS CRACKPOT POLITICAL 
FANTASY!"

P.P.S.  I am not a cypherpunk.  I'm only a guest!  I didn't 
know there was marijuana in the brownies, officer!  I didn't 
PGP sign this message.  Nobody saw me do it -- you can't prove
anything.
