Jefferson laid the foundation stones of the University of Virginia by
strict Masonic principles. At this point he was 34th Degree, and hence all
records were moved to the inner sanctorium, accessible only to Masonic
historians.

We referred to it by the name others used: the Masonic Temple. (When I was
growing up, in the 50s and 60s.). My hunch is that "Masonic National
Memorial" came about when legal experts advised the National Park Service
that "temple" may not be used in the actual name of any park.

Possibly the Papist President did this, to diminish the role of the Masons.
All part of the 6,000 year history of the Battle. Oswald was a Mason, of
course.

Yes, I was transferred from the Alexandria Chapter, Knights Templars, to
the San Jose Chapter, and instructed to find a job which would allow me to
live in close proximity to the Sepulchre of the Rosy Cross. This is why I
had to work for Intel, located a few thousand cubits away (several miles,
for you heathens). My job there was arranged by Robert Noyce and Gordon
Moore, both Masons of course.

Praise be to Hiram!
