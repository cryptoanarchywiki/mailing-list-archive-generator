Fuck Diana and Dodi, rotting garbage, germs,
well ridded, like JFK. 

Up the paparazzi or whoever honored Labor Day
doing dirty work, giving a lesson: run, can't hide.

Two down, thousands more to go worldwide, the 
sooner the better, inshallah, scare the beasts back
to bunker. Guards will drain their blood, day by day.

Grieve for the driver, maybe the royal bitch's cop,
praise Oswald or whoever.
