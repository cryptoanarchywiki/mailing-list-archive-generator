+Attila to go into a state of "brain-lock" wherein he sits at his

    dunno why the message was repeated at cyberpass --each of the 55
    copies I received as of 20 minutes ago has exactly the same header
    date from cyberpass.  that and one of them smoked the primary
    mailbox with a couple hundred null characters.  hun.attila.org
    was offline so it could not have generated the extra messages --so
    where did they loop?  only the shadow knows. If it is something
    by remote SMPT added on, I apologize for the inconvenience.

    the image of my brain in "brain-lock" is apt enough for the reaction;
    as for the flying pig and Hell freezes over --that too. Denning is
    still Denning, and maybe she's just angling for more shill money 
    before she gets back on the track.

    yes, if Clinton ever vetos a bill just because it violats the 
    Constitution, I probably would be gone....
