The people on the Cypherpunks mailing list know Paul Pomes as a member of
Gary Burnore's databasix gang who has been complaining to remailer
operators' upstream sites and employers (such as Jeff Burchell).

Here are some of the e-mails I've received from Paul Pomes:

the anonymous remailers:

Please tell me, Tim, why you disagree with Paul's description on his
Net.Scum page.


I'm posting this for the record to the F-K list, so people are aware
of the kind of behavior Tim Skirvin condones in his friends.
