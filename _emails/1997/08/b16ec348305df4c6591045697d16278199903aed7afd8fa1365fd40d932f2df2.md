I was just browsing the Foresight Exchange (formerly Idea
Futures) and notice that there have been a few changes.  First,
the instruments are now referred to as "bets" and there is quite
a bit more use of the language of "Non-Traditional Wagering."

One claim that caught my eye was BCPrez, owned by
sburnap@wsgc.com and judged by Gafter@eng.sun.com.

This claim pays $1 for each YES coupon if Bill Clinton is
President of the United States at noon on January 1, 2001.

This claim pays $1 for each NO coupon if Bill Clinton is no
longer President of the United States at noon on January 1, 2001,
for any reason including, but not limited to resignation,
impeachment, or death.
