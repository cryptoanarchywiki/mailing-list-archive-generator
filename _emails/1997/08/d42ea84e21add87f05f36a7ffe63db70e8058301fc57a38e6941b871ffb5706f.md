Ah, yes, but the constitution also has a thing on seperation of church and state, or did you fail to read the words?

The Christian Coalition (The Happy Nazi's), is one major group trying to censor information, becuase they and their mythical god think that it's right.  Forcing your beliefs on others in fascism, and never was right.

Monitor the kids web access, or do your job and be a parent.

I've only seend TM degrade Anti-Crypto persons, fascists, Censorous Christians, and other like those groups who fight to usurp our constitution.

I find his posts suprisingly true, if anything else.

Therefore, if you bitch about your kid going to www.porn.com while you where out eating with friends, then that person would be a neglectful parent.

What does that encompass?  Do you supress web pages advocating safe sex because it may corrupt their minds?  Tell me, SuperDad (R), how do you manage to raise your kids perfectly?

TruthMonger isn't obligated to do anything, and he owes you nothing, dumbass.

Oh, so we're a censorous Nazi Ratfucker, are we? Let me tell you something, Downey, don't tell other what to do, TM has every right to post as you do.  So if you don't like his posts, you aren't obligated to read them in the first place.  If it offends you, don't look at it in the first place.  Such a simple thing for such a powerful mind like yours to look over.

As for your forcing morals down our throats all I can say is
