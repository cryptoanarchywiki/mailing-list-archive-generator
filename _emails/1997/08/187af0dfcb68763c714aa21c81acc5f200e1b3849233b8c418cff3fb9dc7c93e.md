   Government of Argentine not happy with the Net
   [3]Ken Rutkowski  Tech Talk News
   
   Argentina's coordinator for the Secretary of Communications has
   announced government plans to intervene in Internet service provision
   within the country in order to establish standards of cost and
   quality.
   
   "We are very dissatisfied with the degree of Internet diffusion," says
   Alejandro Garro. "The government is worried about the low level of
   penetration that the service has in Argentina both geographically and
   in terms of income classes."
   
   Garro is critical of the high cost of the service and the low number
   of Internet subscribers, estimated to around 75,000. He blames the low
   level of investment by national service providers and has announced
   that a public inquiry will deal with the issue.
   
   However, the Secretary of Communications official maintains that no
   government restrictions will be applied to the political, social,
   religious or educational content of the Internet, as has recently
   happened in the U.S.
   
   "In the government resolutions which paved the way for the Internet
   into Argentina, clear reference is made that there exists no way in
   which its contents can be regulated," Garro says.
   
   South America's current statistics shows Argentina's internet growth
   to be the second to Brazil.
