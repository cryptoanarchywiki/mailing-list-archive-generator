Remember that distributed lists receive traffic from toad.com, 
BUT NOT VICE VERSA.

I doubt that, too.

It may be very fast due to the fact that not as many users subscribe to
it, but it does not carry the full traffic because no one feeds it.

I am not even sure that the topology is known by someone. I can only
state that algebra forwards messages to ssz and cyberpass. I'll let the
other operators state their own connections.
