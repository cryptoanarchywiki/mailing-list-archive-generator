Just some thoughts about creating more robust time-stamping services.

Current time stamping services just generate a PGP key, and sign any
messages you send them.  PGP signatures already include a time stamp.

Problem: if we find some interesting uses for time-stamps where it
becomes important that no one can coerce the timestamping service into
back-signing timestamps in the past, the current timestampers will be
able to comply, or as they are automated services, simply confiscating
the machine will likely give the attacker all information required to
back date any number of time-stamps.

One solution to this is for the time-stamper to publish all
time-stamps (they are quite small being detached signatures), and
publish a siganature on all the time-stamps stored in one file each
day.  Perhaps even publish the signature in a newspaper.  Anyone with
that newspaper, or an archive of the master signature only, will be
able to verify any claimed time-stamps -- the publically published
hash (in the signature) must match the time-stamps archived for that
day.

Another way is perhaps to have a sequence of keys for signing
time-stamps on each day, and to discard the private key after that
day.  Authenticate the use-for-one-day-only keys by signing with a
long term key.  If people archive daily keys, the coercion of
timestamping service will be detected if it attempts to publish a
daily key for some date in the past, and the timestamping service
can't sign with old keys as it has purposely discarded the private
halves.
