  Spy Base Expanded
 
  The Government has announced a planned expansion at Blenheim's Waihopai
  spybase to boost New Zealand's ability to monitor satellite communications.
 
  And the Prime Minister, Jim Bolger, says a change to the Crimes Act will
  allow the base to monitor phone calls by foreigners, which was formerly
  illegal.
