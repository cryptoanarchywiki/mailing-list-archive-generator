Regulate more?  Unaccustomed as I am to defending the FCC,
the proposal described below is to regulate *less*, not
more.  Leaving the introduction of local competition to 
state regulation isn't getting the job done, is the implicit
message in Hundt's speech--together with, "I wish the Eighth
Circuit had ignored the law and upheld our national pricing 
rules instead of enjoining them," and "There's gotta be some
way I can get out of SBC's home court in Wichita Falls, the
latest place they've sued me."

In other words, whatever its litigative motivation, what's
proposed is less regulation and fewer regulators, not more.
