The NSA certainly did try to suppress much shift-register-related stuff.

The recent Sandia lawsuit is over shift register stuff.

There are increasingly persistent rumor of a fast factoring algorithm
based on shift registers.

Therefore anything mentioning them is of interest.

But: Was there any info in the package other than the passages from the book?

I don't think it's a good idea to put up chunks of the book - the publisher
might cry copyright infringement, and everybody probably has it anyway.

[I'm about to turn off this box, so I won't see any responses in a while.]
