  Replacing the Marines who murdered an American teenager. Funny that
the drug cartels never felt a need to assassinate border patrol agents
until the American public found it unacceptable for U.S. troops to be
murdering American citizens.

  Have they "received reports" as to the logic behind these actions by
the cartel "henchmen?"
  Do the cartel henchmen think that the assassinated U.S. agents will
not  be replaced? Do they think that assassinating U.S. agents will
lead to lessened security along the border? Do they expect the U.S.
governement to put up "Welcome Drug Smugglers...We Surrender" posters
all along the border?

  Right. I got a parking ticket, so I'm going to put out a contract
on the meter-maid. That'll solve all my parking ticket problems. Then
the police will leave me alone.
  Why didn't I think of this before?

  The cartels only began moving drugs across the border in the last two
years? Border Patrol agents have never been shot at before?
  Are the drug cartel snipers worse shots than the U.S. marines? How
many
American teenage goat herders have the drug cartels murdered so far?

  This explains why America is practically drug-free, with only twice
as many grade school children using heroin as at this time last year.
  If we can keep up the pressure along the border, perhaps one day
_all_ of our children will be junkies.
  Good reasoning...

  And this is going to protect them from snipers and hired assassins
who the drug cartels are sending to their homes to murder them?
  How many illegal immigrants and American border citizens are going 
to be killed in "mistaken self-defence" before they consider it is
now necessary to arm themselves for protection?
  How far will the Border Patrol need to feed the "escalation of
violence" before the President feels comfortable to once again
begin unconstitutionally using the Armed Forces to enforce laws
internally in the U.S.?

  Why do these idiots go to such great lengths to spread FUD as a
smokescreen to help whitewash the murder of American citizens by
U.S. Armed Forces being unconstitutionally deployed internally 
within the U.S.?
  The Border Patrol has always had the authority to use armed agents
to defend our borders, and they have always had special units to
deal with areas which have become more violent than usual.
  The latest "announcements" have nothing to do with "news."
They have to do with smokescreen-FUD.
