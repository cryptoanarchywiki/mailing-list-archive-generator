You might be a bit behind the times on this issue.  Recently 
MTB announced new lower fees: http://www.marktwain.com/fee.html

Are these the ones you consider excessive?


Note that if you consider the new fees to be reasonable, then 
you are now obliged to open account as per your publically 
posted exclamation quoted above.  :-)


Also check out Advance Bank in Australia:

http://www.advance.com.au/ecash/intro/fees/default.htm



I anticipate continually cheaper ecash fees as banks start to 
compete for selective, price-conscious customers like Feanor 
here.  :-)



Regards,

Zooko
