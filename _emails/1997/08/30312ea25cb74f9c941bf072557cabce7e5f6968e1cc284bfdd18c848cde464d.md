Welfare Solution #389:
  Many in the welfair class have their basic needs met by the government
and then steal to buy heroin.
  How about this? - When a person on welfare is busted for heroin use,
or theft to support a habit, the State thereafter sends the person's
welfare check to a Crime Restitution fund and lets the person keep
stealing, only now it is for the purpose of supplying their own
basic needs.
  The crime rate stays the same, but the victims receive some amount
of recompensation.

  Damn, I'm smart...
