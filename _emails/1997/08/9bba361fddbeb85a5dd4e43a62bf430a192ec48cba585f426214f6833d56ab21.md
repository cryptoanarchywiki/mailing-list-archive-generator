Remailers are here to help the weak against the powerful.

I use em 10 times a day.

Good Ideas...  How about publishing how to use remailers and post it to a
high school Bulletin Board?

A many a Christian bunghole forgets that instead of forcing their god down
people's throats, (Tyranny of the MINORITY) they should make an effort to
realize there's such a thing as the real world, were god doesn't matter to
some people.

Yeah, "We gotta protect the children from the pedophiles and cypherpunks!"
I've heard shit like that often from politicians.

Damn right again.

Damn right for the third time.

Which describes my similar views of the growing socialism in America.

If they knock em out, another one just takes over and fills in.  Kinda like
Dynamic Routing.
