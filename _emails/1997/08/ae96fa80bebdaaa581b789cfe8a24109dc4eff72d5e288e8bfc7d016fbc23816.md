Fwd from alt.censorship:  Another unhappy customer of CPAC.

Actually, the Lovely and Talented Ms. Cox is far too shrewd to
actually libel people on her organization's home page, so she
generally links to other sites performing this function, while
maintaining a discreet distance behind an appropriate disclaimer.

Two months ago, I wouldn't have known CPAC from a hole in the
ground.  Today, quite a few people have come to know the
organization and its various shills, largely because of their
attempts at "Ideological Cleansing" on the World Wide Web.

I had a pretty good idea what the organizational agenda was when
I saw the name Debbie Mahoney, who most Usenetters remember from
the Nikki Craft frivolities.  Half a dozen screws short of a
fully connected brain, even on her better days, and an agenda and
a bag of dirty tricks that would have made Richard Nixon jealous.

Most of CPAC's visible agenda is pretty reasonable.  It's the
part about harrassing legal First Ammendment protected speech on
the Net, based on their perception of the sexual orientation of
the people engaging in it, because supposedly such people might
*SOMEDAY* commit a crime, that is a bit of a civil liberties
stretch.

Like most Dworks, they believe in "voodoo molestation," where
unnamed children thousands of miles away are vicariously
"exploited" should a single stranger have "impure thoughts" about
them by looking at even innocuous photographs, or should accurate
depictions of childhood sexuality be permitted in mainstream
media. They are getting their nonsense written into the law one
tiny step at a time, the Hatch "synthetic sexual depictions of
minors" smoke and mirrors being their latest accomplishment.

What's really amazing is how much under the table support the
anti-civil liberties agenda gets from LEAs and agencies of the
Federal Government.  With Civil Forfeiture laws reversing the
concept of "innocent until proven guilty," and helpful government
agencies attempting to apply pressure to suspected "Thought
Criminals," it becomes very difficult for the typical business
owner to avoid capitulating to these folks.

Paladino isn't just a retired police officer, he is a retired
Police Captain!  We're talking management here. He doesn't just
wield the ol' "Assault Plunger," he's part of the design team. :)

Har!  The only rhetorical weapon the Lovely and Talented Ms. Cox
needs in her forum is the Delete Key.

Well, that's very nice, but I think this is a task tantamount to
trying to convert the Ayatollah Khomeni to Episcopalianism

But I wish you the best of luck in your quest.
