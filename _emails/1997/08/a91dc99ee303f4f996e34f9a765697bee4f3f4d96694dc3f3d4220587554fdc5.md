Randy Weaver was a white SEPARATIST, not a white supremacist. The
media is somehow capable of getting the separatist vs. supremacist
when it comes to Louis Farrakhan, but not for Randy Weaver. Randy
may well be, privately, a white supremacist. I think it's very likely,
and even more likely that Farrakhan is a black supremacist, but no
media person has ever pointed to a statement suppporting white
SUPREMACY, as opposed to separation, by Weaver. They continue in
their leftwing racist lies because they are biased, as a whole, against
"evil" white males. Sad that they can't use truth as a standard instead
of lies, since the truth is bad enough.

The available evidence did, however, support a multimillion dollar
verdict for Weaver. Sometimes, it's so wonderful being a taxpayer
I have to break down and cry...
