I haven't looked at the site (I conclude from the name that it's probably not
something I care to see), but I will fight for its free speech. Apparently
a number of people listed at the Net.Scum site do want to shut down this
site because they don't like its name and/or contents.

Agis's troubes with the (largely homosexual) Net.Cabal started before they
signed up Stanford Wallace.

David, with all due respect, I got more interesting things to research
