	No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United 
States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible 
to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that 
Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been 
fourteen Years a Resident within the United States. 

The first sentence is normaly considered the legal standard that is being
referenced here. It's the only place in the Constitution that refers to how
one actualy gains citizenship. There are apparently three (one unmentioned)
ways:

 1.	natural born (ie being physicaly born on US soil) is the highest
        measure of 'American' citizenship

 2.     being a citizen of the US at the time of ratification

 3.     Unementioned, but implied by the stipulation of 1. for the
        office of president. The intent is commenly held that this
        prevents foreign nationals of long-standing from bringing
        foreign influence into the office. Implicit is that the
        legislature set relevant standards.
