That's because you don't understand American Football.  The NSA is Jerry
Kramer for the FBI's Frank Gifford on a double whammy end around of any
substantial public hearings on the subject running a play Lombardi designed
in the height of the Cold War.  The only problem is Lombardi died of cancer,
and the Clinton Administration has been duped into winning one for the Gipper-
except the Gip has altzheimers and Nancy has to wipe his chin, so its bed time
for Bonzo, ITAR and EES!  Party on C'punks! Internet is the revenge of the
nerds on Acid.  (Don't post when you're peaking...don't post when you're
