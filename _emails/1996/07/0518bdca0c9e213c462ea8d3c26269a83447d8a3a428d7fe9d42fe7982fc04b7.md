	unfortunately, that was a modus operandi which I commanded --e.g. if one 
    shoots, waste them all. fortunately, the U.S. SE Asia policies in "denied 
    zones" (we were never there) is no longer in vogue.  however, we will probably 
    see that again in parts of the world as many cultures do not have the basic 
    respect for life we do.  

	the first time you witness a small child begging for chocolate exploded by 
    a remote control pressed by her father, you understand --you do not 
    necessarily like it, it's just survival.

	and faced with a decision of giving up 'n' "friendlies" for 1000n, or even 
    more, to survive, I know where I stood, and still stand.  War is hell --and 
    terrorism is war, make no mistake about it.

	in "black" operations, priority 1 is survival, priority 2 is objective, 
    and accountability is generally not an issue (unless you are out of bounds).
 
= Such overreaction to terrorist events is often precisely what a terrorist 
= wants, as I've explained a couple of times. 
= 
	yes, but it is the press, not the commander, who makes the decision to 
    give the terrorist sympathy coverage.  basicly: exclude, by whatever means, 
    the press and eliminate the terrorists 15 minutes of fame.

= Well, go back and look for it. The clear point of my post was that the U.S.

= 
	no shit; in spades. if the U.S does adopt the police state tactics Bubba 
    is espousing, the U.S. will be faced with _real_ terror, not staged incidents 
    to justify the marial law, etc.  if the populace is already disenchanted, 
    absolute loss of freedom will stir to action some very unlikely participants 
    and partners in "brotherhood."

= 
	U.S. cash has eliminated a lot of Soviet weapons, including, I believe    
    some chemical.  however, keep in mind: the obsolete, and expensive to 
    maintain, hardware predominated.  However, you will never be able to buy out 
    the religious terrorists --they are on a "mission."

	The Western world faces far more threat from fundamentalist religious 
    terrorists than it does from the Soviet Union, etc.

	There is no cure for the "revolutionary" terrorists --just death for their 
    own brand of glory.  If we do not even print their obit, there is no glory!
