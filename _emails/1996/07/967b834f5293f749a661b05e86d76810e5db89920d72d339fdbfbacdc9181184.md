While phone calls can't hurt, this markup ain't gonna happen this week. 
This from Burns' remarks at Cato this morning and reports from committee
staffers. 

In fact, in the wake of the recent bombing it may be better *not* to push
for a markup this week that would result in a narrow vote along partisan
lines. That would bode ill for the bill's future on the floor.
