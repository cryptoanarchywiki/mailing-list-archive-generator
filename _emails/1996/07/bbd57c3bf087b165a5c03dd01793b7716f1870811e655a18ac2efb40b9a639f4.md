Cypherpunks:

At 1735 CDT on Tuesday, July 30, 1996, CNN Atlanta during World News
Tonight reported (in a _very_ brief flash) several "resolutions" adopted
by the Group of Seven (G7) trade meeting in Paris.

At the bottom of the list of resolutions was to "prevent terrorist from
using the Internet" (quote from CNN anchorwoman).

No further explanation was given in regards to that statement, but
methinks that in wake of recent terroristic activities in this country,
Pro-CODE in Congress, and Netscape Navigator 3.0b3 in the hot little
hands of Americans everywhere, there could be a complete retreat from the
"progressive" attitude of legislators in this country towards strong
crypto.

John Young has already requested further information about the G7
meetings, and it would probably behoove us all to know precisely what it
was that was said before such a resolution was agreed upon.  Or, better
yet, whose idea it was to attempt to "prevent terrorists from using the
Internet."

Apologies to all if this is redundant information, and apologies to the
purists for intruding with this newsflash.

ObCrypto: Anyone have any more information on Royal Dutch Shell
apparently the first customer of TIS' firewall package with key escrow ?
Has such a purchase been confirmed, and if so, does it still entail an
agreement with the British government as an escrow agent ?
