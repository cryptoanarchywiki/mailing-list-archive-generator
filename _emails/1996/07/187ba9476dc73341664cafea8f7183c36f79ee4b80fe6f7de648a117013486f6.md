You fail to understand the precisely reasoned Aristotelian syllogistic
logic of Ms. Rand's position (you heretic!):

        1) Smoking is a result of fire.
        2) Fire is cool.
        3) Therefore, smoking is cool.
                Q.E.D.

        4) Logic is cool, and non-logic is non-cool
        5) We're cool
        6) Therefore, light up that cigarette or be excommunicated!
                Q.E.D.

If you don't see the fnords, they won't eat you.
