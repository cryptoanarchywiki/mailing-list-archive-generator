Look at the first 1/e of them, or about the first 36.8% of them. In this
case, the first 7 of them. Then pick the first one after this group which
is better than any of the first group.

While there is some chance that one will get to #20 and find that none of
#8-20 were better than #1-7, this strategy is the best compromise between
"committing too early" and "waiting too long."
