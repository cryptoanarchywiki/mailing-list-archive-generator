I keep hearing suggestions like this, but I don't think they'd work. If you
needed a digital key to grok phone records, then that digital key would be
passed around just as casually as the current passwords. Any organization
that large, where 99% of the information is banal and uninteresting 99% of
the time, cannot keep secrets. It's unreasonable to expect them to. It
doesn't make business sense to promise security, because when they fail to
deliver, as they can't, they'll get their ass sued.

I recently had a practical joker call up all the magazines to which I was
subscribed and change my address to that of the local hospital, where these
practical jokers were suggesting they'd like to send me. There is no
security against this kind of attack, because it's just not in most people's
threat profile. This kind of thing is annoying, but it can't be helped. 
Adding a reasonable level of security to such an insignificant system would
increase the cost of that system by several orders of magnitde. It's just
not worth it.

In the unicorn of Color's relative absence, it falls on me to stress that
you can't trust organizations to protect your privacy. If you need to
participate in an insecure system, and everybody does, use cash, and use
psedonyms.

This is true.
