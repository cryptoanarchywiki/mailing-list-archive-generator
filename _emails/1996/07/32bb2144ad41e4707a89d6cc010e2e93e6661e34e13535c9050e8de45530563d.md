>   WASHINGTON -- With nerves already on edge after the suspicious downing
>   of TWA Flight 800, the bombing at the Olympic Games in Atlanta on
>   Saturday renewed concerns about U.S. safeguards against terrorism.
   
>   But analyses by security experts drew important distinctions between
>   the incidents, and politicians cautioned against measures that would
>   limit liberties.
   
>   Investigators have not officially determined what caused the Flight
>   800 tragedy, but if the jetliner was brought down by terrorists it was
>   a relatively sophisticated operation.
   
>   By comparison, the device in Atlanta was easy to make and detonated in
>   an easily accessible place. "I don't believe that a pipe bomb would
>   have taken down that TWA plane," said a Treasury agent, who requested
   anonymity.
   
>   Another federal investigator noted differences between the Atlanta
>   attack and Middle Eastern terrorists who often use high-powered truck
>   bombs. And domestic militia groups tend to focus on government
>   buildings, not crowds.
   
>   James Alan Fox, the dean of Northeastern University's criminal justice
>   school and a student of criminal behavior, said there are basically
>   two motivations for bombers: revenge and attention.
   
>   "The desire to make a statement can be that of a well-organized
>   terrorist group that uses the victims as pawns to advance their cause,
>   or it could be someone who is just interested in feeling important,"
>   he said.
   
>   Given the recent rise of violent anti-government groups, Fox
>   speculated that a militia sympathizer might use such an event to grab
>   the spotlight.
   
>   "Through an amateurish bombing like this, he can feel like he's part
>   of the movement," Fox said. "He can elevate his sense of importance."
   
[...]
  
>   And building one is almost as simple. "If you don't know how to do it,
>   there are any number of books available ... that will teach you
>   explicitly, step-by-step, how to manufacture the device," Vitch said.
   
[...]

>   House Speaker Newt Gingrich stressed that security was already high at
>   the Olympics, and cautioned against adopting a "police state"
>   mentality.
   
>   "If a terrorist is nutty enough, there's always an opportunity for
>   tragedy," he said, appearing after Nunn on CNN. "A free people can't
>   back down."
