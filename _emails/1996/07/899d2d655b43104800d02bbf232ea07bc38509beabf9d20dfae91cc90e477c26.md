Your opinion. It's not an argument; it's the way it is.

Again your opinion.

Good straw man defense: Apples == Oranges.

Syndication is only profitable for those shows that can make the time 
slots garnered with the biggest advertisers. Drama wins because it's 
chewing gum for the mind - just like Clinton's saturday morning 
broadcast and the subsequent denials issued afterwards. Zero thought 
television appeals to the masses, ie: Bay Watch != Script.

Talk shows that attempt to stimulate active thought on reasonable premise 
generally do not survive long in syndication. With Limbaugh's show, it 
took a double hit as the markets it played to were for the most part late night. 
BTW, this comes from actually looking it up in past TV Guides - not 
mindlessly drooling over the radio - so put away the "he's lying" crap.

In addition, Limbaugh, like other TV hosts, has zero control over when 
the show airs and which episodes get aired. To screw someone in the 
Nielsons, you place the show in the low rate time bracket to guarantee 
bottom ratings, and do re-runs. It's doesn't matter how good the show is 
- it won't fly.

Following the shallow logic of your argument, Limbaugh is not a success 
because he does not broadcast on TV. That parallels the generally 
accepted myth (especially in academia) that one is not an expert in the 
field unless published.

Again, your opinion of the situation. Adverstisers are whores. That's 
what they get paid to do. IF they think going PC will sell more product, 
that's what happens. Watch and see the score of all the Clinton's business 
backing when Hillary is finally indicted.

Right wing, left wing. It's all the same. Pigeon holes for unpopular 
ideas. 

The issue I take with this, is the constant spouting of King Bill's 
pronouncement of why OKC occured in the first place. We don't know WHY it 
took place - that's what a trial is for (if you actually believe that 
justice is blind and lawyers tell the truth always). We will NEVER really 
know - but it's damn fine political fodder to take an unconstitutional 
swipe at the populous with the anti-terrorist legislation.

If you firmly believe the premise that Fascism was the root cause behind 
OKC, then you have no choice but to look to the White House and Capital 
Hill.
