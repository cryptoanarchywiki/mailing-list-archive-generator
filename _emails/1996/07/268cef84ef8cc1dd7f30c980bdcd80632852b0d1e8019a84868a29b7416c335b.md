Allright, considering the 3rd goal, I think the first guy gets all the 
money and everyone lives.

Here's why:

in the case of 2, 19 takes it all and 20 gets nothing. So with 3,
since 20 will get nothing with 2 left, he may as well vote for 18 to get 
it all, since that increases the number who survive.

So with 4, 17 proposes that 17 get all the money, and since 19 and 20
are already resigned to getting nothing, they will go along with 17.

Following this to the end, the first guy gets all the money and everyone  
lives.
