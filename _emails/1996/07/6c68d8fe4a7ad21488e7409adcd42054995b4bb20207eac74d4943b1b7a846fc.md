No, you are not blowing smoke.  That is the hope of the PGPlib
project; PGPlib will make it easy (almost trivial) to integrate PGP
security into almost any application.

Neat.  I don't know enough about OLE to comment, but can we discuss
this offline?  Is there an equivalent of OLE (AppleEvents, perhaps?)
for the Mac?  It would be really cool if we could come up with a
plug-in standard that gets put into mailers such that we could later
add a PGP drop-in that performs the encryption using those standard
interfaces.
