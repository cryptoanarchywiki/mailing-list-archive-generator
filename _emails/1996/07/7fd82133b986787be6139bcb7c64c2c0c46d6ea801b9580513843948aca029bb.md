Ok.  This thread has gone on long enough and covered just about every
point except the one which I originally made in my first response,
which is that I abhor the idea that kids should carry weapons (of any
sort) to school as standard equipment.  In fact, I abhor the idea
that kids should carry weapons at school for any reason.

Enough said.

I do not care to discuss:

1.  Should kids have any weapons at any time?

2.  Should kids have guns (specifically guns)?

3.  Should kids know how to operate weapons of any sort?

If any of you really really have to discuss this issue, let's spare
the rest of the list and send me E-Mail directly.

Thanks!

Ern
