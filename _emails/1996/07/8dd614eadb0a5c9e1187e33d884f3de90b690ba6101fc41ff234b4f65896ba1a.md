I don't believe this is an accurate picture of "what hackers want." The
"information wants to be free" view is one facet of the outlook of
many--but not all--hackers.

Rather than debate semantics of the definition of "hacker," or ask others
to suggest definitions, it might be better for interested folks to read
some of the various books on the topic and then decide for themselves. Some
of them are:

- Levy, "Hackers," of course

- Haffner and Markoff, "Cyberpunk"

- Sterling's book on hackers

- any one (but not more) of the several Shimomura v. Mitnick books

etc.
