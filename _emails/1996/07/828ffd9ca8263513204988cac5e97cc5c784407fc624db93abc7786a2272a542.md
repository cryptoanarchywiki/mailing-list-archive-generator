There might, but it's a difficult problem, and 
implementation-dependent and doesn't always tell you much.  
While your browser may store cookies in a disk file to use 
between sessions, by the time the cookie gets
filed on disk, it's long since cooled down and may have been
written over multiple times.  The interesting time to detect cookies
is when they arrive - this means either watching the network data
stream for cookies (non-portable, unless you use a cookie-proxy,
which is the obvious way to implement it), or else grubbing around
in the browser's memory (highly non-portable, unless you're
modifying the browser source.)  

The "doesn't always tell you much" is because cookies often
seem to contain encrypted or hashed data that isn't meaningful
to the browser-user, only to the cookie-originators.

The cute trick you can do with cookies, which is probably used by
advertising sites such as doubleclick.com, is for the web page owner
to include an IMG which is an href to a CGI program at a cookie company.
The CGI program is able to look at the HTTP_REFERER variable,
which tells what page you were last on, and can therefore create
or use cookie information that tracks where you've been between companies
(e.g. Alice can contract with Cookies Inc. to tell if you've been
to Bob's site recently, if Bob also uses Cookies Inc.)
