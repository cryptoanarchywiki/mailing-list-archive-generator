     <snort> Bullshit. The root causes of violence and discontent are not 
persistent "us against themism". The root causes are situation dependent,
but would fall into 3 areas:

	1) boredom.
	2) lack (of food, housing, land, etc. Also includes perceived lack)
	3) Response to the perceived threat against the 2).

    It is my opnion that the education system in this county is a breeding 
ground for violence and discontent for in several ways:

	1) By almost totally failing to prepare students for "Real Life"
           while at the same time telling them what wonderful intelligent
           humans they are, it sets them up for 1 & 2 above. 

        2) Given the revisionist teachings often presented in schools, and 
           the current practice of "blame the white man", certain ignorant
           (see 1) individuals feel threatened leading to 3 above. 

	As I said in an earilier post, IMO one of the things that has
kept the levels of terrorism down in this country (unless you count things
like the KKK as terrorism...just thought of that hmmmm...again caused by 
the 1 & 3 as well as occasionaly 2 above).

      They have also not been known for their freedoms. The USSR 
supposedly exprted quite a bit of terrorism, especially by proxie. They 
have a decent educational system, but free thought is discouraged.

     Agreed.

	I'd say they _are_ natural. It is natural and healthy to act
violently at times, and insanity is simply a broken [mind brain] shit
happends.

	I doubt it. THere are quite a few well educated racists.

	The monsters are in our heads. They are us.
