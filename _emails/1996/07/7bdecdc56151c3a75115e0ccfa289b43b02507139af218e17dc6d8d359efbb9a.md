 From the responses I received, this one may be a biggie.  And it's one that 
we can't do much about remedying.

I'm beta testing a PGP aware mailer right now called Pronto Secure.  It 
will be a great program when its release.  Requires almost no PGP 
knowledge.  Everything is almost perfectly transparent to the user.

There is also Private Idado, of course, but that's a little harder to use, 
and doesn't have the features of a full-fledged mailer.

I figure that if strong encryption becomes legal to export from the US 
(making international standards easier to implement), we may see more 
programs like these.
