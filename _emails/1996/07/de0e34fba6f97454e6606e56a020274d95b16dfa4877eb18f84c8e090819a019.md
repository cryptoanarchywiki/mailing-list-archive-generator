Please excuse the interruption.  If you have experience building software
that uses the Fortezza card, Murray Mazer at OSF would like to chat --
he's trying to scope out what would be involved in adding it to some
WWW work for an ARPA project.  (Yes, we already have the various Lock-step,
etc., documents from the NSA.)

Please respond to Murray directly.  By way of penance for sending email
to a list that I am not on, I offer a short page on exporting crypto
software, http://www.osf.org/crypto-export.html, that some might find useful.
