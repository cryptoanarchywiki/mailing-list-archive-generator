Count me in. I've got a couple of net-connected Pentiums that are mostly
idle. 

Did you consider the possibility of DES chips in your back-of-the-envelope
calculations? They are hundreds of times faster than PCs. I don't know
where to get them or how much they cost, though. I would expect they
wouldn't be too expensive. The cash might be better spent on DES chips
than on a prize.

Might be able to bring some money in by selling "I Helped Crack DES And 
All I Got Was This Lousy T-shirt" T-shirts.
