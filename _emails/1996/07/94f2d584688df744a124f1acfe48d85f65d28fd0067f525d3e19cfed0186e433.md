Denial?? Sarcasm perhaps...  No "denial" I could see.

As for your "evidence", it is pretty shaky.  Such as the part about not
having a drivers license.  Since when is government regulation of driving
proof of existence?

Why would they have to operate a dummy organization?  All they have to do is
get the names of the subscribers on this list.  Much more cost effective.

And not to forget all the free code that Blaze and Schneier have handed out
over the years.  Maybe that is a plot as well.  Maybe the typos in Applied
Cryptography are a secret conspiracy to weaken the cryptography of the
nation.  Next thing I expect you to say is that Queen Elisabeth is a drug
dealer and/or other LaRouche style rants.

I judge the above individuals by their deeds, not just by their words.  They
have accomplished much in the areas of preserving privacy and cryptography.
What have you done lately?

The voices in your head?  Actually, I have more interest in your motives
than his.

Interesting that you should bring up the FBI actions against dissenting
groups... Actually, your screeds read like some of the stuff the FBI sent to
the Black Panthers in the 60s and 70s. The screeds were written in the same
manner, by an anonymous source, to discredit others in the organization.
Your texts seem designed to cause mistrust amongst those who are willing to
fight for their own freedom.  (Especially amongst those who are not involved
in the middle of the fray.)

Your accusations are not accomplishing anything constructive.  I do not
believe that they were designed to either.  I believe that they were
designed to sow mistrust in the individuals who are making real progress
against the Government held position that they have the right to spy on our
every move.

So far, you have not given any proof as to why we should believe you.  Given
the vitriolic nature of your screeds, I see no reason to do so.
