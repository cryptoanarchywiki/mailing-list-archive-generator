The _selling_ price of DATs was only slightly higher than CDs, around $15
in the U.S. Some DATs were priced identically to CDs, and still didn't
sell.

(Not surprisingly to me, given the chicken-and-egg effect.)

Manufacturing costs of CDs are very low--I've seen estimates as low as 10
cents or less--and the final selling price is dominated by royalties,
overhead staff costs, distribution cost, and, of course, "what the market
will bear."

DAT manufacturing costs could be $1-2, but the above factors would still
dominate.
