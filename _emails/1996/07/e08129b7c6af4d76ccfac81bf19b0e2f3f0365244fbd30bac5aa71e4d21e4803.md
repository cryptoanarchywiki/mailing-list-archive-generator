 Well, not really. It would be severe case of neglegence which is not the same as a mistake. When you drive, you have to prove that you know what you are doing by getting a driver's licence.
 If you are a SWAT guy and some informer would come along and say "This and that person is a terrorist, I know for sure" and you go into that house and shoot everything that moves, well, doesn't sound much like an accident to me...
