You could try exporting this, and turning yourself in to the feds:


#!/bin/perl -sp0777i<X+d*lMLa^*lN%0]dsXx++lMlN/dsM0<j]dsj
$/=unpack('H*',$_);$_=`echo 16dio\U$k"SK$/SM$n\EsN0p[lN*1
lK[d2%Sa2/d0$^Ixp"|dc`;s/\W//g;$_=pack('H*',/((..)*)$/)


problem is they'd probably let you go again, not wanting to make asses
of themselves.  (Some time ago, Raph Levien filed a CJR with the
Office of Defense Trade Controls (permission to export) for a T-shirt
with this code on it, as far as I know they have not deigned to answer
him so far).  Also I think many thousands of people already exported
it with no ill-effect, but no one that I know demanded to be locked
up, or announced to the media/feds that they were going to do it
before hand.

Maybe you and all the people listed on Vinces Arms Exports page could
turn themselves in, and demand to be locked up :-)

Would there be safety in numbers perhaps?  I wonder how many people
would be interested in exporting a share of PGP, say a 50th part or
however many exports you can interest.  It'd probably be a good idea
for someone outside the US to organise so that there'd be no
discernable `ring-leader' they could pin it on in the US.

Just post it here, and Cc it president@whitehouse.com, and some fed
informants email if there is one!
