   Three techno-terrorism Stingers: 
 
   7-24-96. WaPo: "Army Shows Missile Hit Is Unlikely. SAMS 
   Not Ruled Out; Downing Jet Is Hard." 
 
      The Army has run computer simulations to determine 
      whether a U.S.-made Stinger or equivalent weapon could 
      have hit TWA 800 and has concluded it was possible but 
      not likely, defense officials said yesterday. (But read 
      Kalliste's latest.) 
 
   7-24-96. NYP: "What Made Flight 800 Explode?" 
 
      Dr. Oxley said that even the best laboratory technique 
      might miss ANFO. Ammonium nitrate is readily soluble in 
      water and would dissipate rapidly from a submerged 
      wreck. The remaining fuel oil component of the bomb 
      would be hard to distinguish from aviation fuel or other 
      petroleum products. However, an ANFO bomb would have to 
      be detonated by one of the high explosives that do not 
      dissolve in water, which would be easier to detect. 
 
   And: "Computer Expert Testifies in Terror Trial." 
 
      David Swartzendruber, an investigator for Microsoft, who 
      said the F.B.I. asked him to examine the computer's hard 
      drive and reconstitute its files, gave the jury of the 
      Yousef terrorism trial a technical tutorial on how he 
      managed to retrieve files that had been deleted.
