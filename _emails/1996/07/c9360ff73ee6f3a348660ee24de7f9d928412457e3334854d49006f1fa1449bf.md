That's like saying the Bible is outdated because it was written several
thousand years ago.  If the law must change debate it, vote on it, and
implement it.  Don't circumvent it!  I mean should we take away free speech
because more people lie today than ever before in history?  Or should we
take away our religous rights because of the David Koresh's of the world?
Should we take away the guns of the people because less than 30,000 people a
year die of gunfire?  (less than .01% of the nation!)  Should we take away
the double jeopardy clause just because O.J. Simpson *IS* guilty?
