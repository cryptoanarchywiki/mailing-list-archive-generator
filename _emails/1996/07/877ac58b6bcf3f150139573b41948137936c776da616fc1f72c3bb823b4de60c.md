I think the government's ability to "harass" writers of good crypto software 
has been severely limited by their failure to indict Zimmermann.  Remember, 
today they pretty much have to accept the fact that anybody can write any 
software, DOMESTICALLY, without any sort of legal impediment by the laws 
including ITAR.   This is particularly true of a company like Netscape, 
which presumably has the bucks and/or the political clout to make it a 
difficult target.  Any case against Netscape would probably take years if 
not decades to resolve, and long before this happened the world would have 
adopted good encryption regardless.

Look what happened when MIT put PGP on the Web:  "Nothing."
