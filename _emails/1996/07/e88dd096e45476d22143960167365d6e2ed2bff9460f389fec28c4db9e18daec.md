I hadn't planned to comment, but I've seen messages like this one, and a
message from Perry, which appear to take "Anonymous" seriously, or at least
to take him as sending his message as a serious attack. I took it as a
broad satire, though lacking in the craziness which usually signals to all
that a satire or spoof (or facetiousness, depending on one's ideas about
irony) is involved.

Alan, I'm somewhat surprised that you could mention "sarcasm" without
thinking--as I did less than a fourth of the way through the "Anonymous"
piece you are quoting--that the whole piece was a close relative of
sarcasm. That is, a spoof, a satire, a joke. I think the first mention of
VTW being an agent of the Gubment might have been serious, albeit clueless.
But this later piece has all the hallmarks of an over-the-top satire on the
first "Safdar is an agent" piece.

Consider some "tells":

>>We don't have to wonder a second longer about the motives behind

"We don't have to wonder a second longer..." Pretty clearly over the top.

>Why would they have to operate a dummy organization?  All they have to do is
>get the names of the subscribers on this list.  Much more cost effective.

Indeed. Which is why the first piece is so obviously satirical.

>>We must call on the other organizations, like EPIC, EFF, CDT, and ACLU

Further, we must insist that Diffie confess to his role in undermining the
only truly secure cryptosystem, the virtual one-time pad! By propagating
his filth about the strength of public key systems, aided by his
VTW-Tchurka agent Schneier, he has polluted our precious bodily fluids.

The House of Windsor is controlled by the psy-ops Tavistock Insitute, also
known as the White Visitation. Freud, a cocaine and morphine user, advised
Tavistock on psy-ops and the British opium trade. Esalen, a Tavistock-CIA
think tank and training center, has hosted several international meetings
of the Drug Cartel, including both the Cali Cartel and the notorious
Langley Cartel.

(Besides, doesn't the entire British Royal Family behave as if they're on
drugs? 'Nuff said.)

Read up on the uses of this kind of humor.

But who would take the points seriously, besides you, Perry, and one or two
others? I just read it, and thought: "Mildly funny, but not quite crazed
enough."


Boycott "Big Brother Inside" software!
