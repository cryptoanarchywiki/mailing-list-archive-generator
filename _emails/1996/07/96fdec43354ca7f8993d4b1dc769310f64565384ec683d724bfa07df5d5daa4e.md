The taped interview lasted more than two hours, with only five minutes 
airing, so a lot of statements from our mouth is still out of context.

As far as your learning suggestions, I have over 17 years of experience 
in this "underground community", have owned every type of machine 
available, can safely guess I have written a large amount of source code 
equivelent to some of the best, always give it away, and can definitely 
say I have made more a contribution than you could ever hope for in your 
wildest dreams. :)

Dealing with the media is a double edge sword. They contacted me, gaveme 
their bent, and tpaed with me. You can figure out of two hours of tape, 
that with five minutes showing, vaery mnay important points got left out 
which would have put aired statements into context. You never know what 
they, and their editors, ultimately put in the story, for which I have 
yet to see due to my presence at Defcon.

Know who you flame before you do so.  :) No hard feelings.
