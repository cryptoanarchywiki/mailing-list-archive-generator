I had a cookie in my cookies file from them also, and had
not been to their site before.

There's a very obvious way to get their cookie put in
your cookies file without you explicitly going to their site.  I'm
sure a smart boy like you could figure it out.

The server can send whatever it wants to you
in the Set-Cookie: header.  Read the spec.

The user can set Netscape to pop up an alert when a cookie is
sent, and it says what the cookie is.  However there's no
standard encoding format so you get stuff like "IAF=zb87"
or "X=VGhlIGxhdW5jaCBjb2RlIGlzICdiYW5kZXJzbmF0Y2gnCgAA"
which as far as most users are concerned is gibberish, although
it could be base64 encoded "The launch code is 'bandersnatch'".
Most people will accept whatever they're given, assuming that they
can even find the preference for accepting cookies.
