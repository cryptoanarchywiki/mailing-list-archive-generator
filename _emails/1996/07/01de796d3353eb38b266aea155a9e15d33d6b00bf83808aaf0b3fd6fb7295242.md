   Markoff: "Clinton Proposes Initiatives On the Scrambling of 
   Data." 
 
      Under increasing pressure from Congress and the computer 
      industry, the Clinton Administration proposed a series 
      of new data-scrambling policy initiatives yesterday that 
      it said would address the Government's national security 
      concerns while also permitting American companies to 
      compete more effectively overseas.

   William Gibson: "The Net Is a Waste of Time. And that's 
   exactly what's right about it." 
 
      The Web, in its clumsy, larval, curiously innocent way, 
      offers us the opportunity to waste time, to wander 
      aimlessly, to daydream about the countless other lives, 
      the other people, on the far sides of however many 
      monitors in that postgeographical meta-country we 
      increasingly call home. It will probably evolve into 
      something considerably less random, but in the meantime, 
      in its gloriously unsorted Global Ham Television 
      Postcard Universes phase, surfing the Web is a 
      procrastinator's dream. And people who see you doing it 
      might even imagine you're working.
