Just replace it with the French government.  They've already a 
reputation for abusing escrow.

Supposedly 'exceptions' would be made for situations such as medical 
records, etc.  What those exceptions are, and whether they are really 
more than superficial (ie, escrowed but larger keysize) exceptions is 
another question.

What about 'journalist--informant'?

The Clinton admin will ask "Ah, but what if they forget their keys?"

This is nonsense.  It would require a standardized way to return 
record storage keys to someone, and a secure means of doing so... a 
whole other can of worms.

Many of these relationships have been compromised when the state sees 
fit anyway.
