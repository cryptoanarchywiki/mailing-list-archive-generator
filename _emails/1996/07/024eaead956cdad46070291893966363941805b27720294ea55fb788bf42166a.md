The New York Times reports that:

"Tipped off by an anonymous source named "nobody," Simon & Schuster Inc. and
its literary police are engaged in the Internet equivalent of a high-speed
car chase: tracking down a runaway book pirated on right-wing and anarchist

first published in 1967 and intended as political satire, and re-released
early this year by a Simon & Schuster imprint, the Free Press."

chronicles of what used to be called the Metropolitan Government movement?"
