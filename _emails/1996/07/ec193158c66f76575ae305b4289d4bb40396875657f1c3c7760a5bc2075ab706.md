Sort of.  Open "Control Panel."  Open "System."  Click the "Performance"
tab.  Click the <V>irtual Memory radio button.  Check/select "Let <m>e
specify my own virtual memory settings."  Check Di<s>able virtual memory
(not recommended).  Click the "OK" radio button.  Ignore the warning dialog
box which appears and click "Yes."  Reboot WIN95 and your encrypted
partition should be accessible (if you log into it under DOS before loading
Windows), and all your drives will be operating at 16-bit speeds.
