Vulis, time to put you back in my killfile. Gratuitous insults, especially
those not based on important factual points, is your standard mode.

(As Sandy S. also noted, Ritalin has "paradoxical" effects. (I saw Sandy's
remark after sending off my reply to Simon.))

I've _seen_ the kid on Ritalin, and he's zombie. When it wears off, he's
back to being alert and active.
