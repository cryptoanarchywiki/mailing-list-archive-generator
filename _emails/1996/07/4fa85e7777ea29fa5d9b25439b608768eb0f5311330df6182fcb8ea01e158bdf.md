	I guess that part of the problem is that I was in the military, 
and while I was never actually under fire, there was always the possibility,
and after hereing (from people who where there) the silly ass ROE, let's 
just say that when some one is trying to kill you it is nice to be able 
to do something about it. 
	There is something to the theory of peer pressure. I would maintain 
that there is a difference between responding to immediate threats and   
long term supression.

	Sometimes the terrorists are relying on exactly the opposite, a lack
of immediate reaction. This makes the government look impotent.

     Market v.s. Arsenel. Difference between buying a car dealership and 
buying the Big 6 Auto Makers. I was simply refering to removing the 
soviet stocks from the market. That would force the prices up a but, 
might get some private dealers into the market, but I wouldn't think that
this particular market is all that big. I may be wrong about the size of
the market.
