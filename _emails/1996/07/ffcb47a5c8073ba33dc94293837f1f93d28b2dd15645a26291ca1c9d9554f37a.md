     While most of what you say about preventing someone from braking in to 
your house has a great deal of merit, I strongly challenge the idea that 
anyone coming thru a locked door or window at 4 in the morning has "peaceful 
intentions". Prudence indicates that you treat such individuals as hostiles 
until otherwise proven.

     In otherwords: Bullshit, anyone coming thru a window at 4am is either 
a hostile, or you are doing society a favor by removing that person from 
the gene pool.


     I may be a little nuts, but does it strike anyone else that a good 
self defense weapon against ninja raids would be a hand gernade? 

    Seriously, hang it by your bed, and when they break in, grab it. If
they shoot, they die. You are probably already dead. If they don't shoot,
put the pin back in and continue on about your business. A bit of overkill
maybe, but you don't really need to aim all that well.
