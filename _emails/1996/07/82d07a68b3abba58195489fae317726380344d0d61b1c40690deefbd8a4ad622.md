In the August 12, 1996 issue of Forbes, on page 38, is a half-page or so
by Janet Novack titled, _The Accidental Arms Trafficker._ She quotes CEO
Michael Zisman, of IBM's Lotus Development Corp. saying, "Theoretically,
when I take my laptop and get on an airplane and go to London, I am
violating the law."

Goes on to talk briefly about ITAR and the quiet change by the State Dept.
in travel rules, mentions Zisman is in DC lobbying for Pro-Code, calls 64
bit Lotus Notes encryption "advanced," and talks about competitors beating
Lotus to market. [I suppose Zisman hasn't been listening to Dr. Sternlight
or Freeh (whose head, say the Bethesda proctologists, is now stuck *even*
*deeper*! ;}] Anyway, no mention of Lotus' Big-Brother Inside proposal,
hence my use of the term "ironic."

        "Isn't it odd that Harry Browne is dominating talk radio
...while his campaign continues to be overlooked by mainstream
newspapers and television news?" asked campaign director Sharon Ayres.

        "Is Harry Browne being deliberately ignored, or is the rest of
the media just slow to catch on to this genuine grassroots political
phenomenon?" she asked.

"Both." I answered. [See the Miami Herald for no details.]

 Defeat the Duopoly! Vote "NOTA," not Slick/Dull in November.
 Harry Browne for President. Jo Jorgensen for Vice-president.
