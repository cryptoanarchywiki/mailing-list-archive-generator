If you generate every possible word, you aren't getting any advantage
by using crack and not just trying every possibility in your cracker
itself. The whole point of trying english words is to try to reduce
the search space.  I would try to explain this to you, but it probably
isn't worth while.

Furthermore, generating every possible word is trivial -- its the sort
of assignment you give to kids in their first week of programming. No
one needs to be given such a program -- its only about four or five
lines of C.
