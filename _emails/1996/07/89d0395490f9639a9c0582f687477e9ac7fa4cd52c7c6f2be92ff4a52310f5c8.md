I think that one of the faults of the mentality of development is that
people think "who will pay" first, rather than making a hack first, and
then trying to apply it to a more commercial context.

Seems to have worked with PGP/Netscape/Yahoo/<insert startup high tech IPO
here>.

Concur most strongly.

All most important questions to consider.

I think if people begin to write modularly there will be nice front ends
for almost everything.
