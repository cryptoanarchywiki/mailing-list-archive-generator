Some of them *were* and are terrorists.  Some of them are not.  If Islamic
freedom fighters refrained from murdering monks and sixteen year old girls
then people would refrain from calling them terrorists.

It is not the mixed signals, it is the mixed behavior.

The islamic fundamentalists have a thoroughly well deserved reputation
for malevolent evil, for rape and the deliberate individual personal 
murder of women and children as an instrument of terror.

While the guys fighting the Israelis in Lebanon are more or
less honorable men who fight according to the laws of war,
the Islamic fundamentalists in Algeria are simply vicious subhuman 
monsters who deserve to die, each and every one, and their pals in 
Egypt and the Sudan are not much better.
