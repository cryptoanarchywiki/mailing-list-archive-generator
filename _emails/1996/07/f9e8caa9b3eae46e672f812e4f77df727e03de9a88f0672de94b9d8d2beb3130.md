I think it will be a popular product.  Sort of the credit card
equivalent of the disposable phone card.  

Since the transactions all involve the extraction of money, there
is really no record of your purchases.  The linking together of a 
number of cash wishdrawals is not that big a deal, although they
could be used to track your movements if you did them in more than
one specific location.

There is also the problem of being photographed every time you use
an ATM, if you do not wish your identity known. 

Still, for people who are not on the FBI's most wanted list, who
plan to completely exhaust the card in a single location, and who
dislike signing a huge bunch of Traveler's Checks at one time to 
buy something, it sounds like something that might be handy to have.
