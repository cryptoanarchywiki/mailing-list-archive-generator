I don't think that demanding more liberty can in any way fall into any
of those three categories.  What happened to protecting a minorities Rights
from the Majority?  Simply because a majority decided they should take away
my Rights (in this case to encryption, and for the sake of argument, I will
concede for the moment that a majority actually did decide this) doesn't mean 
they should be taken away.  This is what the Constitution and other founding 
documents are designed to protect us against.  Saying "I have the Right to give 
encryption to anyone I want" is not forcing my will on the wider population,
it is an attempt to keep the wider population from forcing their 
un-Constitutional will on me.  //cerridwyn//
