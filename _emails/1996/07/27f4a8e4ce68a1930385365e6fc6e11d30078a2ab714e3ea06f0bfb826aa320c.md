My point was not that govts want to escrow communication keys, it was that
this is appearing more and more in commercial products marketed to
businesses.  I run the computer system for a small office and I would
rather not see employee email - maybe I am just naive.  However, there
obviously is a demand for this type of product.  It must come from either a
lack of understanding of crypto, or a freeh-style authoritarianism on the
part of corporate executives.  I wouldn't rule either one out.  If it is
the latter, I'm not sure there is anything we can do.
