Okay, Okay, Okay...

Speaking as a Genuine (unconvicted ;-)) Felon and Certified-Insane Acid
Casualty, that was probably a fair shot. However...

About six weeks ago (as measured by the household clutter-depth since
then...) my sister-in-law, her husband (a comptroller for a chip-company),
their kids, my wife and I went to Concord to look at the "rude bridge"
where the first shots of the American revolution were fired.  Actually
choked me up a bit. Never figured on that.

Anyway, I was standing there at the monument to the British war dead ;-),
and said to the kids (ages 15, 13, and 11), "Guys, right here, on this
spot," (they looked down) " is were America [sic] started. If you could
imagine the ground here painted red, white and blue, and then the colors
radiating out from here in all directions", (they looked around) "from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, to Alaska and Hawaii, and bunch of islands in both
oceans. Oh, yeah. Even the Moon." Then they looked up.

Then they caught themselves, and looked at *me*, with classic adolescent
disdain, like I was from Mars. "Oh. *Right*, Uncle Bob..."

;-).

Same kids gifted me this Christmas with a polartec jester's cap (complete
with bells, handy when shovelling in a blizzard in, ahem, February?). When
they got here, I got a pair of Lennon-looking sunglasses with holograms of
Tex Avery eyeballs on them. Tokens of esteem for their Uncle Bob.


Hmmm. Maybe I *did* see colors out there in Concord. Greaaat visuals. Just
don't move your head too fast, man, or you'll miss 'em....

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
