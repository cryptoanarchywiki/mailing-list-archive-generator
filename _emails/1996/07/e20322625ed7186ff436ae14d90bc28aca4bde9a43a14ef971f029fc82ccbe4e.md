How ironic. :>

Remember why people are downloading the software in the first place. They
only have eight-cent exportable 40-bit SSL. 

<sarcasm>
I'm sure the evil Iraqi terrorists (and other horsemen) are snooping the
line, using their newly purchased PCs and FPGAs to crack the 40-bit crypto
so that they can gain the wonderful advantages of 128-bit SSL, which will
of course prevent wiretaps from working, thus aiding them in their
terrorist attacks and bringing about the end of the world as we know it.
