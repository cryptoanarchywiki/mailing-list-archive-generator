Induction would be a good choice.  Hmmm, how about using the house water
pipes? (Or heater ducts?) Not only should they conduct water, it does
offer the possibility of some VERY funny hiding spots.  If you were
seriously worried, you could even waterproof the drive (Enough epoxy and
almost anything can be waterproofed <g>) and power it off of a turbine in
the water pipe!  I imagine hiding it in a septic tank would probably
discourage searchers as well... Finally, I'd have a duress code (or
emergency button or timer ... etc) wired up to a thermite charge. Might
be a bit permanent, but certainly would come in handy.  (hmmm. Wire it up
behind an access panel in a heater duct. Set it so there are something
like 15 screws that need to be unfastened to get to it, including some
elsewhere. If it's done in the wrong order, WHOOSH)

Oh, and did I mention that putting it in a (metal) duct or pipe would
probably be enough to tempest shield a drive? (As I understand it,
monitors are the least secure part of the system, followed by cpus.)  In
fact, it ought to be enough to throw off a metal detecter/search device
as well. You could even leave a crudload of old MFM drives (20MB! wheee!)
in similar spots as decoys... Put things like encrypted copies of the
constitution, large scans of 4th ammendment plaintext, etc, on those...
Ought to be at least irritating and it might be interesting to have them
have to read that into record at a trial as well...

BTW, I'd try a fiber-optic connector to the machine because 1) it's
waterproof and you wouldn't have to be quite as paranoid about leaks, 2)
it's far more secure, 3) it's faster and 4) it's probably impossible to
trace like a metal wire (i.e. run current through and trace magnetic
fields...). Put it in the usual snarl of wires (Cable TV, telephone -
multiple lines of course, home intranet, etc) and it could be really
nasty. Finally, if it was wired up on a home network, you could protect
by carefully choosing your network architecture, hopefully getting one
that allows hidden devices (i.e. only shows up on access attempts,
perhaps only w/right password.)
