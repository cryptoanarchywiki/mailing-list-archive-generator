I remember hearing about a case on this end of the continent (west coast)
that involved  a store that had been robbed many times. The owner noticed
that most burglars came through the skylight, so he electrified it. Not
much of a charge, just something like 12 volts - enough to keep someones
hands off of it...  However, a klutzy burglar managed to fall into the
skylight and get stuck.  His partner deserted him.  Over the course of
several hours, he died... *ouch*  Needless to say, his next-of-kin sued
and won. The guy lost his store.


Another one I liked: in (I believe) Pennsylvania, a drunk peed on an
electrified third rail.  His next of kin sued the trolley company and
won...

A man tried to commit suicide in Chicago by jumping onto an El track.  He
was only crippled, so he sued and won!
