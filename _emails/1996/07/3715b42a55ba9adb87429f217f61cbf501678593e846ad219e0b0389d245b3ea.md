Cpunks:

While shopping for a new phone recently, I came across
two models (Toshiba and Uniden I believe) that
have buttons to "privatize" you conversations. These
were on no-cord models. Does anyone have any idea
on what these actually do? Can the phones  change
 the frequency the call is on randomly
so people can't tune into it? I know cellulars offer something
similar. Personally, I would never put much faith into
something of this sort.
