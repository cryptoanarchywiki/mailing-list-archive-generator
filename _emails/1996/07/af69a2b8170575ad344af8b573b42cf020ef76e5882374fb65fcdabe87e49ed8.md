Damn betcha. It's called OpenDoc, and it's probably the most exciting thing to happen to the Mac since desktop publishing. <plug> See my web-page for a rant or two on the subject. </plug>

Vinnie Moscaritolo (Famous ex-Marine and Samoan Attorney) started a list at mailto://majordomo@thumper.vmeng.com called mac-crypto (send "subscribe mac-crypto" in the body of the message), where we're talking about stuff like this, and other things. One of the projects we've been kicking around is a Macintosh Digital Commerce Conference ("Digital Commerce *is* Financial Cryptography", and all that...), and it looks like Vinnie's very close to getting a conference date set up.

A while ago, the folks working on the Macintosh Cryptography Interface Project merged their list with mac-crypto, so things have been getting interesting, even if traffic is a little sparse these days.  Getting a conference date firmed up should change that, we hope. So would a discussion of PGPlib in OpenDoc...

Cheers,
