In response to Hal's questions...

I think the Eternity Service, as I understand the idea (altho I haven't 
read the paper yet), is valuable to society.  In some countries, the 
government may try to suppress views and information unpopular to them 
and the ES could help make the information available.  Sort of like Radio 
Free Internet.  This one use - helping people who may be living under 
repressive governments get access to more information - would make the 
service valuable.  

There is certainly a large risk to intellectual property holders, if people
used such a service to distribute copies of software, music, videos, or
whatever, to avoid paying royalties and etc.
