AwakenToMe@aol.com, in a profound display of stubbornness, continues
to insist that his program to enumerate all possible words of length N
(that is, aaaaa, aaaab, aaaac, etc.) is somehow interesting. I am
therefore forced to drive in the nail with a sledgehammer. Forgive me.

Hardly. A ten year old could do it. I know, since I wrote substantially more
sophisticated stuff when I was ten.

Since you insist, here is less than a minute's work. Yes, I timed it.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	char i[6];

	for (i[0] = 'a'; i[0] < 'z'; i[0]++)
	  for (i[1] = 'a'; i[1] < 'z'; i[1]++)
	    for (i[2] = 'a'; i[2] < 'z'; i[2]++)
	      for (i[3] = 'a'; i[3] < 'z'; i[3]++)
		for (i[4] = 'a'; i[4] < 'z'; i[4]++)
		  printf("%s\n", i);
}

The operative portion of the program is six lines ling, and five of
those lines are virtually identical.

You can write the thing much more elegantly, without redundant
code. However, I have elected to leave it as utterly brainless as
possible to demonstrate that ANYONE could write the thing.

Human stupidity is never a surprise.
