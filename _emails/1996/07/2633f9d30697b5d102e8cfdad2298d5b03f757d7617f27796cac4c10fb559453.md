Yes and ultimately more obvious. There are about 10 zillion ways that
someone could hide a pass phrase. Bits are bits. Under the assumption that
breaking into a home may be easy, you have to look at the possibility that
this is what the person is looking for. You know, "Big brother broke into
my house to subvert my freedoms", ploy. What a great way to get your self
on Date Line.
