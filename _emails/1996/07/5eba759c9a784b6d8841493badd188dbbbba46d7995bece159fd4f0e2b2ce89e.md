Not everybody limits their language to the 96 characters supported by ASCII;
many people use languages that have umlauts and cedillas and accent marks
and haceks
and other inkblots above/under/around their letters, or symbols like
section markers and Yen and British Pound currency symbols.  A signature form
that trashes files down to 7 bits would not only annoy these people,
but also their readers :-)  

One readily obvious alternative - hashing only the lower 7 bits of each letter,
but not damaging the letter itself - is probably worse, because the message
can be altered by changing high bits without changing the signature,
while the shred-them-all method at least leaves you sure what you're signing.

But they're both pretty bad....
