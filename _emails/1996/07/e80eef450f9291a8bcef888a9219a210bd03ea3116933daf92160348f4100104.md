	The internet can't get that much capacity, we don't have
swiutching technology beyond the test phase to handle gigabits of data
per second, and we don't have the routing technology to move packets
from point A to points B-ZZZ when searching through a routing table
hundreds of thousands of lines long that never has a chance to
stabalize between the change messages that keep coming in.

	If you're interested, search for the writings of Noel Chiappa,
who talks about this regularly on ietf, big-internet, etc.
