Y'all:

I'm pleased to announce that the WinSock Remailer is going
into operation tonight at 11:00 PM.

Please feel free to test it.  You can get the key by sending
a message to winsock@c2.org with the "Subject: remailer-key".

After about a week of further testing, I will be releasing the
executables to everyone who sent me a note asking to 
participate in the alpha test.  If you want to be included, 
please send me a note.

Here's the info for the remailer-list:

$remailer{"winsock"} = "<winsock@c2.org> cpunk pgp hash cut ksub reord";

I'll be adding "post" to this list after I get a more thorough 
testing of the NNTP code that I added for authentication.  "latent"
is also pending.

The remailer will run every 60 seconds from 12:00 AM to 8:00 AM
every day and whenever I am online.  c2.org automatically spools
the messages when I am not connected.

Note:  alt.religion.scientology and alt.clearing.technology are
blocked.  I'm not interested in run-ins with either supporters
or detractors of the Church of Scientology.  Binary and picture
groups are also blocked, but only because I don't have the 
bandwidth to support them.

Anyone who has blocking lists that they want to share, please
send them to me.

Regards,
