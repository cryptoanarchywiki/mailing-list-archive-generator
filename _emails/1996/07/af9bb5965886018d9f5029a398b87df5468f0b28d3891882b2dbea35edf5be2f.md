I would disagree with you here jim.  Perhaps you have a selective memory,
but representatives from all the organizations attended the Clipper II
hearings at NIST in Maryland and gave the pro-GAK folks a good drubbing.
(with NIST's microphone too.  They're such good sports...)

Person after person got up at the first of those (and subsequent ones) and
grilled representatives from the FBI, NSA, NIST, and the White House.
The ACLU, EPIC, EFF, CDT, and VTW were all there and pitched in.  Somehow
I don't think that getting grilled is what's missing.  

The thing that's holding us back here is that we're all pretty sold on
our arguments.  When the White House comes to their senses, or Congress
overrules them, or the market makes them irrelevant, then we'll have some
progress.
