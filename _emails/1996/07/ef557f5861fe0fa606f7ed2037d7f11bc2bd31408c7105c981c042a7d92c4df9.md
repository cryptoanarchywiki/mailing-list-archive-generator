Is there somewhere where I could find more information on finding out RNG
algorithms or reverse-engineering RNG's, once you have some quantity of
random numbers generated by some RNG?

For example a local bank is giving each customer a list with 600 one-time
passwords (6-digit decimal numbers), and I believe they use the account
number as (one of the) seeds for the RNG. Is there some program that I
could use, together with the numbers and possible seed, to try to break
the RNG?
