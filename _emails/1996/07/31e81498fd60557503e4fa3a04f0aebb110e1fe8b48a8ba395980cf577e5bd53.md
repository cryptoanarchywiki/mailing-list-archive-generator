If you lock your doors and windows, forced entry generally becomes a noisy, 
somewhat time-consuming process that allows anyone not in a recreational drug 
induced stupor or coma sufficient time to pull a pistol out of their shoulder 
holster (or nightstand drawer, etc.) and pull the hammer back.  (2-3 seconds is 
all I need!)

In the majority of cases, (although the margin is on the decline) when an armed 
homeowner confronts a burglar, the burglar runs like projectile diarrhea for the 
nearest exit, and no shots are fired.  However, these incidents are not counted 
as firearms "use", under current crime statistic collection methodology.  Many 
of these incidents are not reported, especially in areas where gun ownership is 
not approved by the authorities.  Furthermore, if your Cousin Vinnie the crack 
addict breaks into your house at 0300, attempts to rob you at knifepoint, and 
you force-feed him half a dozen jacketed hollow points for his trouble, the 
incident will usually be put in the same statistical category as the "crazed 
husband shoots wife, children, 11 neighbors, and 6 police officers" tragedies, 
even though you may never be charged with anything.  Most "studies" of crime 
statistics come from gun control advocacy groups, and are suitable primarily for 
lining the bottoms of birdcages.

I have $10 US that says that this idiot has never fired a gun is his life.  
Furthermore, it is obvious he has no clue when it comes to bullet/target 
interaction.  A "reversed semi-wadcutter" is going to stay in its original shape 
(for the most part), which will tend to make it over-penetrate, wasting kinetic 
energy and endangering people behind the target.  Moreover, anyone who 
intentionally uses an inaccurate load is a fool--missed shots waste ammo, have 
no effect on the target, and run a significant risk of endangering innocent 
people.  A hollow point or Glaser is a much better option.
