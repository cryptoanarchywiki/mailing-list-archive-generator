   "Microsoft Sees A Major Shift For Computers." John Markoff 
 
      MS is preparing to release new software that would bring 
      the most fundamental change to personal computers since 
      the machines were invented in the 1970's. Demonstrated 
      last week and to be distributed free to the public, the 
      software is designed to blend the multimedia technology 
      of the Web with Windows 95. PCs would treat each parcel 
      of material as a document with all the stand-alone 
      capabilities of a Web page. Each of these documents 
      would have hyperlinks so that the creator of a document 
      could make it available for reading, listening or 
      viewing anywhere on the Web. 
 
      "This is going to make enormous changes possible," said 
      Jesse Berst, editor of Windows Watcher. "It's analogous 
      to the advent of the automobile." "We're moving into a 
      new world; we now have a new metaphor," said John Seely 
      Brown, director of the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto 
      Research Center. 
 
      A potentially troublesome aspect to Microsoft's new 
      thrust is the extent to which it will further blur the 
      distinctions between data that sit safely on a person's 
      own computer and data flowing around the Internet. While 
      certain measures of privacy and security control are 
      built into Microsoft's current and planned software, it 
      is still working to develop better security for Internet 
      software.
