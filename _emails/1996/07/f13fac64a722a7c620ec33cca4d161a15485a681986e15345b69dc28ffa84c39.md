I downloaded the thing... here's what I posted to sci.crypt:

Looks like snake oil to me... the whole thing comes down to each executable
having a unique "registration number" so that only that copy of the software
can decrypt with that "registration number".  You encrypt with a key
of between 5 and 10 text characters, and you provide the registration number
of the destination party. The "registration number" and key get combined
in some way to form the encryption key.  (Registration numbers are public
information).  Since ONLY ;) the destination party has the correct copy of
the software, only they can decrypt the data, hence the key can be passed
over an insecure channel. Heh. They say the encryption algorithm is a form
of substitution cipher.

SO.... since the "registration number" and key are public, the only thing
keeping this together is the lack of the algorithm, which of course doesn't
keep it together at all.

Fun...

   Ken Thompson has an automobile which he helped design.  Unlike most
   automobiles, it has neither speedometer, nor gas gage, nor any of the
   numerous idiot lights which plague the modern driver.  Rather, if the
   driver makes any mistake, a giant "?" lights up in the center of the
   dashboard.  "The experienced driver", he says, "will usually know
   what's wrong."
