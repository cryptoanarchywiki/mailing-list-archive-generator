It might be hard to get an ATM card that lets you take out $10,000/day.  I
suppose a VISA card or a Debit card might allow that amount.

Says:

"Currency.-The physical transfer of currency from one person to another.
This does not include a transfer of funds by means of bank check, bank
draft, wire transfer or other written order that does not involve the
physical transfer of currency."

I guess an ATM is a machine and not a person.  But these are the
instructions not the regs.

The form doesn't have to be filed by individuals only by financial
institutions. An ATM doesn't involve the bank giving you cash unless you are
using the ATM machine at your own bank.  I remember seeing some regs that
did mention ATM transfers but can't recall specifics.  Usually, they figure
that they have the "paper trail" anyway through your normal bank records.
