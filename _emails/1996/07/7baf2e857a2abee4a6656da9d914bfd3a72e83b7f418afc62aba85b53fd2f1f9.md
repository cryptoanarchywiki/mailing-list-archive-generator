Yep.  Been there, done that.

Line wrap problems are the bain of PGP sigs.  This is the reason that most
PGP shells will force a line wrap before generating the signature.  The only
way around it is to turn off all line wrapping or have a utility do it for
you before signing it.

I am wondering why there is not a signing option that ignores all
non-printing characters.  Might fix some of these problems...  (Can anyone
think of a reason this would be a "Bad Thing(tm)"?)
