Yup, and it was the illegal drug of choice in Sweden in the 1960's,
making its use as a convenient way to quiet down rambuncious kids
a bit strange -- but the "medical professionals" have an explanation.

Interestingly, it is illegal to hit kids in Sweden -- the courts
call it assault, just as if you hit an adult. When I lived there
(in the '60 and '70s), I took an informal survey and found only
one person who had ever been spanked as a child -- and only once,
for breaking her brother's violin.

A good friend would infrequently give her infant a pat on the
bottom (when he tried climbing on the stove), but was always
careful to aim for the well-padded diaper.

You may wish to consider whether Sweden's low murder rate is
related to the lack of parent-child violence.
