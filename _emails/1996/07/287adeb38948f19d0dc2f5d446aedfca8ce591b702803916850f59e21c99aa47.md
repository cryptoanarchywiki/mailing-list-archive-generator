Hrmmm... for the "pre-dawn raid" thing though, I've got a better one.

Where I live (Wake County, North Carolina), if someone's breaking into
your home, until they identify themselves as law inforcement, its legal to
shoot, and even kill, them, _As long as they're facing you_... funny, eh?

So, if someone breaks through my window at 6:00 AM, and they don't say
"Police" or "Secret Services", they aren't gonna be saying anything.
