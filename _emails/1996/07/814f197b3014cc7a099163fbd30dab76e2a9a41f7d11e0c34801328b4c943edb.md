And here's your suspect (from anonymous):
 
I AM NOT GOING TO TOLERATE EXISTENCE OF A MEDIUM FOR CRIMINAL HACKERS
 AND MUNITIONS SMUGGLERS. I WILL COMPLAIN TO THE FBI IMMEDIATELY SO THAT THEY
 CAN TRACK YOU DOWN AND CLOSE THIS LIST.                            

Now all you have to do is match this sentence structure with the 911 
tape.  Maybe there's a correlation between an electronic fingerprint and 
fingerprints on the phone booth.


This is very worrysome, as it truly is a "world stage" event that could 
really serve to galvanize various governments into uniting against strong 
non-escrowed crypto.  Hey, it will look good for the international PR, 
never mind the fact that not everybody will be so 'diligent' in registering 
their keys and/or use the "approved" crypto.

And of course, this country just purchased another IBM computer for 
"nuclear simulation".  Gee, I wonder what else that power might be used 
for?  (but then again, it's from IBM, purveyor of the Olympics computer 
services)
