Tim and others have discussed the effectiveness of random search
vs. centralized servers, problems of cheating, scaling, etc.
My take is that, if you can ignore scaling, the best approach
is probably to have a central server that doles out keyspace
and wraps around when it reaches 100%, and doesn't worry too much
about collecting results - even if there are cheaters, machine
failures, etc., and people don't finish their keyspace,
it'll be more likely to cover the whole space than randoms.
(Make it a web page, and use cut&paste to transfer to the
search programs so they don't need to be network-equipped.)

To support scaling, make it easy for people to run subset servers;
grab a chunk of keyspace from the main server and dole it out
to people who ask you for it.  If you want to get fancy,
hack a DNS server to allow people to register their machines
as NNN.descrack.org, 0<=NNN<1000, so that people can find 
subsets without having to ask the main server.
