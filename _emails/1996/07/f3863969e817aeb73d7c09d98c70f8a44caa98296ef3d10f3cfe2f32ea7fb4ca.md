I checked this out with baited breath, hoping to find a juicy
Netscape security hole as promised.  Unfortunately, all it is
is a mis-configured httpd server at rsa.com.  It should be
doing SSL but it's not.  A bummer, but probably not a lie and
certainly not a major bug.

Try ssl3.netscape.com:443.  It's doing ssl3.

Not at all.  So quit doing it.
