Most demands for ID and conformations with police involve the operation of
motor vehicles.  I have never been "IDed" except at border crossings and
when I was operating motor vehicles.  Clean and dressed up people are rarely
IDed on foot.  Maybe you should mention some of the specific practices in
Seattle that disturb you.

Or flying on a commercial flight.  So far, prosecutions for "failure to
possess ID" have not succeeded.  You *can* be prosecuted for failure to
identify yourself (which is *not* the same thing).  The Philadelphia airport
was allegedly requiring *two* pieces of ID for flights.  If they are talking
about two pieces of photo -- government-issued ID, I wonder where the 80% of
Americans without a Passport (x the 90% of Americans who are not government
employees) get the second piece of ID. [Is it a violation of something if
you Heil Hitler od Sieg Heil the airline clerk when they ask to see your ID.
It's not a threat, it's an expression of honor.]

The Supremes outlawed exile as a punishment in a case during the 1950s.
Said it was cruel and unusual punishment.  Guess it's OK to execute people
but not deprive them of having a government.

"If the security guard did it in Atlanta, that will be the second US
Olympics in which the only 'terrorist incident' was perpetrated by a
security person.  I guess we should outlaw security at such gatherings to
prevent terrorism."
