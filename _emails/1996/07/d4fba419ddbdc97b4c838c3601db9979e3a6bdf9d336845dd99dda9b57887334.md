I especially like Dr. Denning's quote:

Now _there_ is a goal to shoot for!


Minor comments:

First, a historical question:
	What percentage of telegraph traffic was encrypted in the 1910s?

A global information infrastructure (encrypted or not) is without precedent in world history, is it not?

I noticed that she said "allows", not "would allow". That contradicts
<<I'm not ready to accept "the cat is out of the bag.">>, doesn't it?
