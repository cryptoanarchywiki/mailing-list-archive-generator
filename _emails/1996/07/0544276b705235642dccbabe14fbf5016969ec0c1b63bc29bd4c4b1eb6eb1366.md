I'm also skeptical of these "VISA Travel Money" cards. That is, they don't
seem to be too useful for anything.

After all, cash works well. (It's rarely stolen, in my experience, or at
least this is not a major concern. Traveller's checks work well, and can be
"cashed" into the local currency. ATM machines fill the same function these
"VISA Travel Money" cards apparently do; at least when I was in Europe the
last time this is what I used, and my French francs were as untraceable as
could be.

As I see it, yet another marketing solution looking for a problem.

A real step would be a true privacy card, a card issued in a jurisdiction
unfriendly to U.S. investigators and offering various transaction-blinding
options. I have to wonder what pressures have been put on the major credit
card companies...
