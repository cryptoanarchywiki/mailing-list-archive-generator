Here's an idea that I always wanted to implement but never did
yet.  I thought I'd share and if someone else has already done
it let me have a copy.


I should be able to execute scripts remotely by sending e-mail
to an account.  Simple mail-handling scripts at that account
should check the PGP signature (and timestamp/counter to prevent
replay/delay attacks) and then pass the contents to a full
script-language interpreter.


Perl is a natural choice of interpreter.  Has anybody
implemented this (hopefully complete with replay/delay 
prevention)?


Thanks!

Bryce

P.S.  No, actually I can't think of any good use for this
trick.  But maybe if I had it I would find good uses for it.
