Really? Extreme poverty seems to be its own reward.

So, I think market economies are dealing with the incompetent and/or the
lazy very well.

(This may sound harsh to many of you, but think about a world of seven
billion souls, many of them living at the margins of survival. Not much
more could be expected, no matter the economic system. In particular,
command economies have not been more effective. Think about it this way: in
100 years, who cares if a billion or so folks lived only an average of
38.37 years instead of 41.91 years?)
