Sure, and I didn't exactly state what my position _is_ on so-called queer
rights. I said I have no interest in hearing nonsense about it, e.g., the
drumbeat of propaganda, etc.

Of course, it should come as no surprise that I believe everyone has the
legal right to refuse to associate with anyone. Thus, a shop owner or
employer, in my view, has every right to refuse service or employment to
whomever he wishes.

While many may not _like_ this (including me, when I am banned from certain
businesses, as I am), it is part and parcel of liberty.
