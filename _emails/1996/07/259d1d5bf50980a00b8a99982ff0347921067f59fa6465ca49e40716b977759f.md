	Actually, my Ritalin was one of the things that led me to come to the
conclusion that drug laws were nonsense. It's a Schedule II drug that I never
felt _any_ addiction to; I was off it on evenings, weekends, and during
holidays. So at least in my case it had a pro-libertarian effect.

	The matter is that Ritalin isn't acting as a mind control pill, or
whatever the hysterics are claiming. Indeed, I nominate it as one of the more
transhumanist drugs I know of (for adults with ADHD and children), and I've
done somewhat of a study of the subject.
