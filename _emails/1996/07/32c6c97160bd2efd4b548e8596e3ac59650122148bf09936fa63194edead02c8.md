This is such a smug, superior, put-off that I have to give the original
questioner his answer. Reverse engineering means taking a product and from
inspection and analysis, figuring out a way to duplicate it. Engineering is
starting out with specs and coming out with the product. Reverse
engineering is starting out with the product, coming up with specs and then
duplicating the product.
