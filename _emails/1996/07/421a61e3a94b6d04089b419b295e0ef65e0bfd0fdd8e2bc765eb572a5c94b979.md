Irrelevant.

The job of a parent is exactly that. The "benevolent despotism" begins
totally, when a child is unable to survive physically unaided, and
gradually diminishes as a child achieves increasing independence--to eat,
to walk, to read, to think, to make independent critical judgements.

This is a massive evasion. I referred to librarians' traditional role in
managing children's reading. Most libraries (for instance) won't permit
young children in the adult stacks, and many have a children's card that
isn't valid for certain kinds of books. Further, librarians often observe
what children are reading and try to gently guide them--mostly informed by
the child's tastes but also with a certain "keep them out of hot water"
flavor.  Big, busy libraries may not be able to do that, but I am forever
grateful for mine in Hartford, Connecticut. Under the gentle guidance of
librarians my intellectual development was stimulated in such a way that
I'm convinced it was one factor in my eventually being able to get into
MIT. And yes, they wouldn't let me into some sections until I was at an age
where they thought I could handle it.

We're not talking about "young adults" here. It's been clear from my
comments from the beginning that I was talking about young children. Piaget
didn't do all that much with teen-agers.

This has to do with attempted censorship of what adults may read, and is
totally off-topic.

More than that, you conceded that the constraints should be tailored to the
age of the child (or at least what could be observed about the child's
maturity). That was my only point and one with which you at first
disagreed. Reread your post--you are really blind to your own prejudices
about my posts.

I never said that. Please provide evidence that I did.

On this we disagree. It is a legitimate disagreement. And "capriciousness"
is a dishonest misrepresentation of what I said.

Reread your own sentence (which I note you don't quote). It says what I
claim, not your revisionist rewriting above.

As usual with the intellectually bankrupt, calling names such as "Statist"
is  "the last resort of the scoundrel".

Plonk!
