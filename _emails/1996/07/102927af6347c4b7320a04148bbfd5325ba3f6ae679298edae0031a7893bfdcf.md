The other type of those, the one that is used in music stores on CD's, is
done slightly (much) differently...

they use two peices of metalic foil shaped like this....
______
|     \
|______\

pointed in opposite directions, so as to look like this

_________
\ |      \
 \|_______\

when magnatized the two peices stick together, and will reflect a signal
on a harmonic of a specific wavelength of sound (the length of the total,
so that if they're not magnatized it won't reflect to the right
frequency), thus being easily detected.

these are actually fairly easy to fake or get past ;)
