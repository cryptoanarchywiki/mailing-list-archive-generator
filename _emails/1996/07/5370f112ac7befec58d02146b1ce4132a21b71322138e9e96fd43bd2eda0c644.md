Can you say RAID?  I've had an idea for something similar to this, where
you have a VERY large database btreed using the file system and
subdirectories. This type of thing would REALLY lend itself to Unix, as
we could just mount separate drives as branches of the tree.  Now, enable
NFS and things get interesting...

Hmmmm... Don't they have some of those 8mm tapes that go to 4-8GM per
tape? Anyone have access to one?
