A story I heard: During a privacy conference back when Clipper was
first proposed (about 3 yrs ago) people were questioning an NSA rep 
about escrow.  He started off his rebuttal by asking "Is Sternlight 
here?" and then contined his reasoning as to why Clipper was a good 
thing.

Don't know if this actually happened, but I'm sure if it did some 
here would remember it.
