This isn't EconPunks, so I'll just say I haven't seen the term used
except in the context of tacit coordination (see <http://www.best.com/
~ddfr/Academic/Property/Property.html> for some examples).  There is
some coordination here, I guess: terrorists and television crews both
benefit from being in the same place when the bomb goes off.  But this
probably isn't a driving motivation for either.
