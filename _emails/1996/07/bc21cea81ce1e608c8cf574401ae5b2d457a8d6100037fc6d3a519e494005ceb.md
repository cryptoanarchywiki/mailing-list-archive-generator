It is pretty easy to defend against dictionary attacks by using an expanded
character set--mixed caps and lower case; numbers substituted for some
letters according to easily-remembered personal rules.

"Da5id" in "Snow Crash" by Neal Stephenson is an obvious example, since the
"v" is a roman numeral 5. Another is the "Compuserve method" of inserting
punctuation characters between words making up a password or key. Since the
length of the words used is unknown to the cracker, this makes his job
harder.

That is--a dictionary which accomodates such things as the above will be
pretty large. With the number rule, there would have to be 10 additional
versions of the one-letter word, 10 versions of each leading character
making up a two letter word, and then it starts increasing combinatorially.
Might as well use brute force.
