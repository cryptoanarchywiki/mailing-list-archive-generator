Once they start offering Internet news/email/USENET feeds (one way) by 
DSS-type dish antenna from satellite, it'll be mighty hard to figure out 
who's receiving the data. They could probably easily provide 10 megabits per 
second, which I assume would be more than enough for what's needed.

(BTW, for a few years a company called "Planet Connect" has been providing 
FIDOnet data feeds, although they use the older-style, large antenna 
systems, and their data rate is 19.2kbps, not even close to enough for 
Internet service.)
