Yup.. thats it.  And they said I was an idiot when I [Correctly] said
that Netscape wasn't activly fighting the ITAR.

Or even better... Lets look at this version...

lets say I get my internet service from MCI.  Now lets say I put crypto on
my web page.  When somebody from out of the country visits my web page,
and downloads it, who's exporting it?  Them, MCI, or me?  I'd say they
are, and I doubt ITAR covers this... this is one of those things thats
covered in "guidelines". ;) umm.... Smooch Smooch?
