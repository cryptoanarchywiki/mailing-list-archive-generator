I personally keep a Desert Eagle .44 Magnum (66 oz empty, 8+1 capacity, 
semi-auto,) with +P+ 240 grain FMJSP hunting loads.  It's not just a gun, it's 
an adventure. :) Even if it doesn't penetrate body armor, the impact will knock 
anyone entering entering through your window at 0400 on their duff long enough 
for a follow-up shot or two to finish the job.  This is in addition to a 12-gage 
pump shotgun and an M-1 carbine.

transportation, and transfer of all non-sporting firearms. ...Consider the 
following statement:  I would fire upon U.S. citizens who refuse or resist 
confiscation of firearms banned by the U.S. government."
