Thanks.

It's certainly beginning to look like "infowar" is the new
funding/legislation fount....I suggest it be given honorary status as a
"Horseman."

Winn Schwartau is running conferences, is talking about the imminent danger
of the nation's computer networks being knocked out (paraphrasing his
latest "Wired" item: "imagine your ATM network being knocked out and people
being unable to gain access to their money").

Schwartau is predicting/advocating a "fifth branch" of the military to deal
with the this threat. A cyberforce, as it were.

Color me skeptical, but I see this all as a lot of hype and fear-mongering.
Folks in the Pentagon, FBI, and NSA probably see it as a way to get more
funding, Folks in the consulting business probably see it as a way to crank
up the seminar prices and increase the number and frequency of "Information
Warfare" workshops and seminars.

And the anti-terrorism folks will use it to tighten up.

(Of course, tonight's explosion of the TWA 800 looks to be a bomb, from all
indications...this _could_ be the "Oklahoma II" incident that will trigger
more draconian surveillance legislation. Just a concern I have.)
