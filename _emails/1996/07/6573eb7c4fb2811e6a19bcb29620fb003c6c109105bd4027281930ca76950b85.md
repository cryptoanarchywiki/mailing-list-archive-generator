Actually, he fell through the roof of a school he was trying to burgalize.

In a similar incident a burglar broke into a house that was being treated
for pests (i.e., was full of toxic fumes). He died; his family sued the
owners and won.

Maybe someone can post a reference to these two cases. I recall that both
happened in New York, but I could be wrong.
