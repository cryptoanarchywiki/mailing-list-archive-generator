It is probably true that journalism was more concentrated in the late 1800's 
and early 1900's, since it consisted of a few newspapers.  However, I think 
a good argument could be made that because government was dramatically 
smaller than today, that concentration was not nearly as detrimental as it 
would be today under similar circumstances.
