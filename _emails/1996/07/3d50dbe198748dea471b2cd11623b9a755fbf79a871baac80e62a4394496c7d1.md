If this were to be a card (via RS232 or PC-bus), thousands of people would 
be able to copy it, once the development process is finished. -> You'd have 
hardware that all those people could use for a distributed crack, the 
building cost would be distributed also (<$100), only development would 
have to be at one place (sponsored of course). Now, that would be a scary 
thought for DES-fans!
