As far as churning goes, why not just mount both the decoy and the
encrypted filesystems simultaneously?  Have a perl script (stored on the
hidden volume of course) that automatically decodes random images from
alt.binaries.pictures.* into the decoy system and nukes the oldest decoy
files.  And go ahead and keep a copy of all your assorted /var/named &
other config files in there too.

Honest officer, I keep that partition unmounted so that a system crash is
less likely to clobber my painfully constructed configuration files - and
it's encrypted so that crackers won't be able to alter my configuration
backup to add security holes.

Let them go nuts trying to un-stego the smut images once you've given them
the duress key.
