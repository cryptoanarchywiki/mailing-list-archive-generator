Oh Gawd, NOW you've done it.....

We will NOW get treated to UnProfessor's SternFUD's entire life history.

How he went & designed the first rockets, then gave the idea to
Goddard. Then he went to England and invented tea. Next he came
back & was a personal advisor for Tricky Dick. Later, he discovered
the oil in Alaska. In the middle he invented the concept of
money....

Dimitri, did you HAVE to do that?

BTW, I'm thinking of starting a pool on how long 'til 
	a) FUD launches his first 'Punk Plonk.
	b) He goes away, for a while.

Both are 100% sure things; the only odds are WHEN...
Write me off the list if you are interested....
