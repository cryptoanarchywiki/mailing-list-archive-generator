: stock market would take a dive, ... I would suggest that tacitly or at least
: implicitly, the Chinese goverment has conceded that it will never try a
: major violent suppression of political unrest again. That, or it will decide
: that the Internet is a bad influence, and should be abolished.

: What that does is give us a window of opportunity. Hongkong has one

: has the Internet. What can we do?
: 
: 1) Collect the e-mail addresses as Allen suggested (including those in
: Hongkong), and send them a single, short message offering to teach them free
: of cost how to use pgp and all the goodies at
: http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm/cbsw.html

Unfortunately for those of us in the United States or who are
otherwise subject to its jurisdiction such an offer would require a
license or a waiver of jurisdiction under the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations before it could safely be carried out.  That
particular highly worthwhile project would seem to fall under the
definition of performing defense services as well as involving the
disclosure of technical data relating to an item on the United States
Munitions List.

Obscene isn't it?
