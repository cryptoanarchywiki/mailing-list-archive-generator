Well, my site just got ViaCrypt pgp version 4 (Personel Edition) and it was 
the first I'd heard of it.  None of my utilities that worked with the old 
ViaCrypt pgp 2.7.1 seem to work under version 4 (the script that checks 
signatures dies, as does the exmh interface which can no longer find my 
personal keys).

I assume that these are mostly due to changes in the command-line options, 
although I can find no list of what exactly has changed.

But my REAL question is will this version of pgp be compatible with the 
international versions?  If not, I'd just assume revert to pgp 2.6.2 from 
MIT.

I don't speak for the Federal Reserve Board, it doesn't speak for me.
