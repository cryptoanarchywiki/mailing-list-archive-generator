The local PBS station had a program on bomb detection and manufacture.  It
included a section with someone from the BATF explaining how Pipebombs work
and included slow motion video.  (It might have been an episode of NOVA.  I
came in in the middle.)  It even included information about how nails and
screws would be included for extra schrapnel.  (Maybe this is part of a plot
to remove funding from PBS once and for all...)

The media and government types who are blaming the Internet for pipebombs do
not get out enough.  I have seen good working descriptions in books since I
was a small child.  (Of course, I actually read books as a child.  And not
just the pablum they expect kids to read nowadays.)  Of course, since when
have government and media pronouncements have had anything to do with the
real world and/or truth...
