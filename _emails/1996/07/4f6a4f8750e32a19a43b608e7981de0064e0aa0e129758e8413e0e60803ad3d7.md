That is half correct.  It will only create emscrypt.lock if you have
configured procmail for that kind of locking, otherwise it will use
lockf or flock to make the lock.

As Hal pointed out, you will still have one process per message, but
they will be processed one at a time.

Another possibility is to call lockfile (a program included with
procmail which performs compatible locking).

You're better off using procmail's locking as it does what you're
looking for, and many people have beat on the code over the years.
