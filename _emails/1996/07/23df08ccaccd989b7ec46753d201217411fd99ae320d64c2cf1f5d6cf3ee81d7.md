A positive excerpt from UK's House of Lords's July 23 lengthy, thoughtful
report on the information society: 
 
 
http://www.hmsoinfo.gov.uk/hmso/document/inforsoc/ch5.htm#5.92 
 
 
 
5.92 The US Government's restrictions on exporting software from the USA
which includes high levels of encryption is threatening to become a major
barrier to the development of the information Superhighways, which is in
no-one's interests. The Government must join with other EU Member States in
putting pressure on the USA to relax its restrictions on the export of
encryption technology. 
 
 
Thanks to Mark Gould on Cyberia-L, see the full report at:
