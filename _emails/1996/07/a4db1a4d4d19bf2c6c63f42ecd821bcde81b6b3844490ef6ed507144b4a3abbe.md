I Think so. IMHO the goverment would say that an individual or organization
did/conspired to/whetever transport controled technolagy outside of the
country.
Thay would claim that the only thing that had changed was the mode of
transport.
Each single email, by it's self, would be legal, but if you Know of other
portions of the source being transfered, you would be part of a "Criminal
Organization".
