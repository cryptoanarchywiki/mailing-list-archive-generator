I should have said, "about a tenth of a cent."  I didn't mean to imply a linkage.

At any given time, that's true, but over time the cost of that processing 
(per unit transaction) will drop, probably in some exponential fashion.  

For an optical fiber transmission system, the cost of the fiber does NOT go 
up with the speed, since it's nowhere near its limiting capacity.  
End-termination systems will be more expensive, but I suspect that's a 
relatively small fraction of the overall cost.  

CPU cost will be significant, but then again the Moore's law trend will 
predominate.  CPU's probably have 1000 times the power, per unit cost, than 
they did in 1980 or so.  It would probably be over-optimistic to think that 
they'll drop the same ratio over the next 15 or so years, but it'll be 
enough of a reduction so that whatever costs appear to be limits today won't 
be then.
