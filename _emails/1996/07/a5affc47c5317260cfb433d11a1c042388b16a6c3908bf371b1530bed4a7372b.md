	Thus, my desire to listen to the Drummers of Burundi justifies
a cost of $16.99 for the latest REM album?  If I want the wide range
of African music thats now available (and I do), then I should be
willing to pay a premium to get it.  No reason for Alanis Morisette
fans to subsidise those of us with musical taste.

	Except for collusion on the part of the major record
companies, who have a price called the 'MAP,' or minimum access price,
under which they won't provide advertising for the record & store.
Those MAPs sit between 10.81 & 10.88 for the biggest six record
companies.  Theres a lawsuit in process now to decide if there is
collusion occuring.
