If you look real carefully at ftp://utopia.hacktic.nl/pub/replay
/pub/incoming you'll notice that the "commercial" 2.01 for Win32
has actually been uploaded.

The reason that is was not done sooner is probably that it felt
more like stealing to upload software that Netscape expected you
to pay for. Now that Netscape is finally giving away strong crypto
versions to anybody who asks for it (and claims to be an American)
it isn't really stealing in the same sense anymore. It's just ITAR
we're ignoring, not Netscape's commercial interests.
