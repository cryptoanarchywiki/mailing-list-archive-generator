My apologies if you thought that I was pinpointing you, Mark, as an
individual.  You actually did a good job of proving to Ben that his example
words were useless in his argument.  One should gather actual data before
making statements.  God knows everyone else will evaluate data ten-times
more than the poster will.  I was merely trying to state that negative
comments (that have no direction or obvious support of the conversation) are
not in the interest of the entire group.  At most, they should be considered
private and voiced via email.
