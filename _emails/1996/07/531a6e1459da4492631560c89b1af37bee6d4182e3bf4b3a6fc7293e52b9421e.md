I will presume for the moment that you actually support this position and 
this is not a blatant troll.

I disagree completely with the premise that the government will always be 
the juciest target. If you read Tim May's treatise about terrorism, he 
makes a point that may never be openly discussed by the press as it makes 
all too much sense. That point is simply that terrorism begins to blossom 
against a government when  a section of the citizenry percieves that they 
have been disenfranchised by that government and view no opportunity for 
legal recourse to change the situation, and are not willing to live under 
those rules.

The fact that AT&T may or may not use encryption on their records is 
irrelevant. That BATF agent could have been the one to pull records 
illegally instead. Now where is your point ? A government represented has 
now abused position and priviledge to persue a purpose - right or wrong.

The US government is at risk because of the robber baron mentality of 
many of the government officials, congressmen, representatives, and of 
course BIll & Hillary. IMO They have purposefully abused position and 
priveldge and lined their own pockets to their advantage - leaving many of 
the citizenry wondering what is really going on. I am not a supporter of 
the militia movement - however, they do represent a growing segment of the 
population that feels disenfrachised and view violence against the visible 
government establishment as a way to make their point.

There are others who view the government the same way as the militia, but 
resort to trying to continue to work within the existing system to make 
the changes they feel are necessary. In this venue encryption is not only 
desirable but necessary as those in power are trying to consolidate their 
position by trying to use information they can glean against those who 
want to remove them from office or thwart their efforts to enact bad 
legislation. RIchard Nixon was noted for his use of the IRS against 
select folks. Now we have BIll Clinton and the 700+ personal files 
collect for use against "enemies" of the administration.

My position is that crypto should be available to all - not just the 
government or a priviledged few. Any technology man creates can be used 
for good or evil. That will never change.
