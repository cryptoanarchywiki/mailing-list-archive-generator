Since no one has mentioned exactly what happened at the LP Convention, I
will relate it from memory and JR can correct me.

They were going to vote on adopting a platform plank that upheld the right
of everybody to use any crypto they wanted and export it an everything and
also opposing the proposal for a requirement that people use a key escrow
system set up by the government.

JR offered an amendment which changed the language to refer to "so-called
Key Escrow (actually government access to keys GAK)"  and he also explained
that "escrow" is where you place something with a trusted third party and
the government is neither trusted nor a third party.  He mentioned
cypherpunks live on CSPAN.

Maybe when JR finished the Con he can post the original proposed language of
the LPs plank and the final language as amended.
