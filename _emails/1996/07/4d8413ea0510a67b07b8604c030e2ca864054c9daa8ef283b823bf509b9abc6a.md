I don't have any crypto references, but due to the Libertarian overtones
on this list I believe it is on-topic enough.

On the local news I saw footage of a couple schmoozing in the Olympic
(Centennial?) Park after its reopening. The voice-over said that all
bags are being searched, and the couple said that rather than be
alarmed or nervous, they "appreciated" it.

I'm not quite sure what to think about this. I don't have enough
experience to form a well thought-out opinion. I'd like to hear some
of everyone's thoughts on this: Is this bag-searching a violation,
(which was my immediate reaction) or is it not, because you have to
already be going into the controlled area to get searched?

Thanks for your help.
