I've a few machines around that could be dedicated almost full time to the
task. What are the bandwidth requirements? Specifically, could the
keycracker be run over a 28.8 (with a 486 running linux)?  If so, how many
486's could I get over a single 28.8 (i.e. 28.8 -> multiple 486's daisy
chained with ppp over direct serial connection)?
