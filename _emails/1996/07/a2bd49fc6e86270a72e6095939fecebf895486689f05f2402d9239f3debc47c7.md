   Email reply)

2. Click the download reference.

3. You will be be asked for a username and password. enter:
	username: iwave
	password: 7365583

4. You will now start downloading the package.

5. Unzip the file, and read the readme.txt file for information on
   using the CGI utility and encoder.
