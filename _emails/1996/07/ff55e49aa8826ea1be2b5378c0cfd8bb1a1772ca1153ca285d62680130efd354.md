This touches upon a favourite rant of mine.

If someone had your public key, and a trusted software module 
with which to use it, you could use a "Digital Signature".
PGP offers such data integrity and signing functions.
You also indicate you have PGP - even better.

So, now you are left with ensuuring people have your public key,
and the recipient having a trusted software tool.
Again, PGP is relatively well accepted in this regard.
Trusted - depends on the source of the recipient's
copy.

So, now you need to ensure that you can get your public key 
(to verify the digital signature with) in the hands of all 
your possible, or intended, recipients. 

Now the race is on for as many people as possible to generate 
PGP public keys/certificates bearing your name, or variations 
of it. Once that occurs, there is a fair chance that one of 
these keys will verfiy the digital signature on a piece of
software purportedly from you. Still, not many people will have 
your true PGP public key/certificate, but, them's the breaks.
