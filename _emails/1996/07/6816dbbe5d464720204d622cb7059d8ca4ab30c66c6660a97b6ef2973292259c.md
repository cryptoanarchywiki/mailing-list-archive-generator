If the attacker uses a known-plaintext attack, then all this is a non-issue.
However, if the attacker is using a ciphertext-only attack, looking for the
MSB to be 0 is a good way to find a correct decryption.  Also, randomness tests
could be run on recovered plaintexts.  This is why compression before
encryption is a good idea.  If the plaintext is completely random, then there
is no way to crack the ciphertext.
