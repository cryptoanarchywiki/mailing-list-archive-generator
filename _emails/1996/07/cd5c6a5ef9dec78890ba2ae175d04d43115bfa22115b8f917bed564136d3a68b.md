By the way, I certainly don't want to be seen as a main promulagator of
"monkeywrenching" Netscape's system! I made a few snide/droll/obvious
points that the software will likely leak out fairly quickly, but I was not
_advocating_ such a thing, nor was I suggesting that someone be pinned up
on the wall as a decoy (;-}).

I don't think Netscape is misbehaving.

I do have some concerns about a method to control leakage that requires
data bases of names and addresses of persons accessing a site. One can
imagine this concept extended to requiring data bases of names and
addresses to be accessed before Web sites may be connected to.

(Especially when such "verifications" are so easily spoofed or the results
subverted. For example, if the results reported here are valid, the
Netscape downloads are not serialized, so any of the millions who download
it could be the exporters...essentially nothing is gained, but the
precedent is set for demanding identity before downloading...note that
retail software purchases do not as yet require identification--you pay
your money and that's that. Even if some dirty furriner could buy his
software and take it home in his luggage.)
