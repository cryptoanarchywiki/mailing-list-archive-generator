There *are* a lot of things government can do.  There aren't a lot of
things it can do well.  But you want to wait and see what a *government
study group* decides to recommend?  Gee, who can guess what they'll decide?

This wonderful little anecdote proves nothing by itself.  How many of
these merchant ships survived u-boat torpedos thanks to this hardening?
I'd guess the number's pretty near zero.

This is simply wrong.  There *are* restrictions on domestic crypto.  They
are restrictions imposed by the crypto export policy.   Maybe there isn't
an outright ban but there *are* nevertheless real restrictions (look up
"restrict" in a dictionary near you).  And tell Netscape there are no
restrictions.  We've all seen what they're going through to provide
download access to domestic customers for products with strong encryption.
News flash for David: jumping through these types of government-imposed
hoops costs *real money* that could be better spent elsewhere.

It is being done as we speak.  The government has clearly slowed the
process down though.  And the more governmental involvement, the slower
the process will go.  (And the quality of the result will likely suffer
too.)

This hasn't been demonstrated to my satisfaction.  I disagree, and I bet
most American companies would too.

Apples and oranges.  The costs of protecting companies' resources is not
so high and the potential costs of not doing so are far higher.

I'm merely pointing out the hypocrisy of a government that bemoans the
lack of security infrastructure even as it has been hard at work raising
obstacles to those that would build it.

Putting the government in charge of fixing security problems is likely
to result in an infrastructure optimized for surveillance, as we've seen
with other government-sponsored initiatives (Clipper, DigitalTelephony,
etc.).  The only security assistance that business and the public have ever
gotten from the government has been the kind with unacceptable conditions
(like undisclosed algorithms, "escrowed" keys, secret courts, etc.).
If the government wants to do that to its employees, fine.  (In fact,
if a private company wants to do that to its employees, that's fine too; 
I won't be working for them, but IMO it's their prerogative.)  But I
don't want the government telling industry what to do with its security. 
Furthermore, I don't want my tax dollars involved in funding (or perhaps
worse, "incentivising") it.  Just get government out of this business.
