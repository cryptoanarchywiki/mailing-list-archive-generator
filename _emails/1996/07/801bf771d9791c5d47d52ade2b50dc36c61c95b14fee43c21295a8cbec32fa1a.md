   By "screwed," I mean that, because of the default settings, a user who
wants to receive mail encrypted with ciphers stronger than 40-bit will
still receive a majority of messages encrypted at 40 bits. Since S/MIME
has not been widely deployed yet, this claim is speculation. However,
there is a lot of reason to believe it.

  The problem is not that the combination is illegal, it's that nobody
will actually configure their clients to use it.

   Perhaps I'm missing something here. In the model I'm assuming, if I
wanted to send you mail, the first thing I'd do is get your certificate.
Today, I'd do that by going to the VeriSign Web site, but in the near
future I would expect this lookup to be automatic. Either way, it would be
up to VeriSign to ship the algorithm preference information along with the
X.509 cert (whether by degenerate PKCS#7 or some other means). This means
that VeriSign needs to agree to ship the information in response to
queries, and also that users keep the VeriSign database up to date with
respect to algorithm preferences. This is the infrastructure requirement I
referred to, one that isn't present in my proposal.
   After the first exchange of e-mail, the problem goes away. However, I
consider the protection of the inital round to be important.

   Good. The point I'm making has more to do with representing 128-bit RC2
as being of comparable trustworthiness as 3DES, though, not simply of
offering the option. Since RC2 is slower than 3DES, it's not at all clear
to me why anyone would choose it.

   Just to be clear, I'm not arguing with you because I think Netscape
will ship a bad product. However, I do see a real danger that, in the
field, S/MIME will have severe security problems, mostly because people
don't understand how to use it correctly. Carefully explaining the exact
strengths and limitations of S/MIME is our best hope of it being deployed
as a strong crypto protocol. Since most of the force behind S/MIME now is
from marketing, rather than security, people, I don't see much of that
going on (as a case in point, from a technical perspective, the recent
interoperability testing has been fairly sloppy). It is my hope that
Netscape will do better.
