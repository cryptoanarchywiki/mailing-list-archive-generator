Probably so, and I think I recall my friend mentioning that this was the
kid needed the dose. Whether it's an upper or a downer or whatever is
immaterial: it acts as a downer for this kid. A zombie drug, at least on
this kid. (And I gather that this is the main effect on the many California
schoolchildren who are getting their school-administered doses of mind
control drugs.)

>From what I've read--and I'm no expert, having long had essentially the
_opposite_ of "attention deficit disorder," assuming it really even
exists!--most children getting Ritalin are just being sedated. Behavior
control in its purest form. While the kids stop their wandering attention
and constant physical motions, it's because they're in a mental fog, just
one step away from drooling. (The 8-year-old friend of my friend's son is
so zoned out he can't play video games well at all...until the drugs wear
off.)

Au contraire, I almost _never_ rework my posts. They are sent out as I
write them, just as conversation is not reworked and edited. For an
informal list, the conversational mode works best for me. (I get a kick out
of John Young's obscure stuff, but if he _talks_ this way, whoah!)

BTW, I saw a comment that Bill Gates is almost certainly an ADD person...or
maybe the comment was that he is borderline autistic? (I think it was the
latter, based on his focus on things, his physical mannerisms, etc. Perhaps
growing up in rainy Seattle made him a kind of "rain man.")
