It depends on several things. It is possible using the right combination of
frequency and voltage (ie Tesla Coil) to have literaly millions of volts
running over your body with no effect. There is an effect of electricity,
The Skin Effect, where as the frequency and voltage rise the actual flow of
electrons moves to the outer surface of conductors. There is little or no
rf current flowing in the center of the wire.
