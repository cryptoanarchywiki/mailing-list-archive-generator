     Ok bonehead, explain the difference between LIBRARIAN and LIBRARY
CHILDREN'S PROGRAM. 

     Then go back and re-read what Mr. Hayden wrote. Then think about it for
a couple hours. Then look at what you wrote. Does what you wrote have 
more than a passing relationship with what Mr. Hayden wrote? 

     No. You ignored his point, you missed his point, and you didn't bother
to reply to his point, you just went blythly blathering along on your own 
self indulgent little course. 

     Let us look at this line by line:

     Librarian != library children's program.

    How so Mr AssTorch? He contends that the Library Bill of Rights says one 
thing and you argue that the library childrens programs do a LOT more than 
this bill of rights says they must. 

    The US Bill of rights says a lot of things that our government ignores 
whenever possible, that doesn't mean that those words aren't written, nor
does it mean that they aren't in effect anywhere.
