Actually, David came out _against_ both Digital Telephony and mandatory key
escrow, as I recall. For me, his process of conversion took entirely too
long, as most of saw in the ostensibly voluntary Clipper program the seeds
of a mandatory regimen. But he _did_ come out against these programs.

I think this refutes the point that he's never heard of any degree of
Statism that offends his sensibilities.

Understandable. I find that _writing_ an article, even a short one like
this, takes about as much time as adding 10 people to my filter file or
hitting the "delete" key 50 times, so filtering out stuff I don't want to
read has never been an issue.
