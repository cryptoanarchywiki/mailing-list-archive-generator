Lots of people still deal with the Internet remotely, despite the 
profileration of SLIP/PPP accounts.  To see the the difference consider the 
following two scenarios:

1. Alice connects to the Internet via a PPP account.  She downloads all of 
her mail to Exchange (on her local computer), from which she can 
encrypt/decrypt et cetera.  All encryption is done locally and securely.

2. Bob connects to the Internet via a "shell" account.  All processing is 
done by his ISP's unix machine.  He reads his mail on the mail reader 
provided by unix machine.  He has two choices:

2A. Install PGP on the ISP's unix machine and use it to encrypt/decrypt 
messages.  This is relatively easy, but also insecure.  The ISP's 
administration has access to his secret keyring, and his password must be 
sent over the modem line to the ISP before it used.  Thus he is "typing his 
passphrase over the net".

2B. He can download the mail to his local machine manually.  Manually 
encrypt/decrypt the mail there and then upload it (again manually) to the 
host computer to be sent.  This is secure, but it's also a pain in the 
butt.
