   6-17-96. NYP: 
 
   "11 Officers Are Accused of Failure to pay Taxes. Claims of 
   Sovereignty and 98 Dependents." 
 
      At least 11 New York City police officers have been 
      accused of failing to pay any Federal taxes for several 
      years by declaring they each had 98 dependents and by 
      insisting that the Government had no right to tax them. 
      The officers relied on a package of instructions that 
      described how to avoid paying taxes by declaring that 
      they were sovereign citizens who did not have to pay 
      taxes. 
 
   "16 Indicted On Charges Of Internet Pornography." 
 
      Exon-Reno-ing into one of the more distant frontiers of 
      sexual crime, a Federal grand jury charged 16 people in 
      the US and abroad with joining in a pornography ring. 
      Its members shared homemade pictures, recounted their 
      sexual experiences with children and even chatted 
      electronically as two of the men molested a 10-year-old 
      girl. The case appeared likely to heighten concerns 
      about the spread of child pornography over the Internet.
