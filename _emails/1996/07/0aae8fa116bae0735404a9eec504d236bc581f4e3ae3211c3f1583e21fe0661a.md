Hi there

Should try SECURE DESK-TOP as well (PC only), it can encrypt (DES and IDEA)
any: 
- file 
- directory 
- groups of directories
- Hard Disk
- Floppy
- Removable drive

And it can add PEM capabilities to most e-mail clients and it's WIN95 and
user friendly. Try it at:

                http://www.systems.it/secure

There are NO export restrictions on it as well because it's Italian made.

ciao

Anthony
