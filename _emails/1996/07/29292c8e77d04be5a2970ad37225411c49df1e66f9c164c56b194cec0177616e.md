Thanks!  I should've suspected that The Master had worked on this problem.

No, but my friend Chip Morningstar pointed out that "ontology recapitulates
philately,"

(For those befuddled by these jokes, the biological original was "ontogeny
recapitulates phylogeny," which means that the morphological development of
a fetus in the womb retraces, or recapitulates, the morphological
development throughout history of the species, roughly. Thus, gills, fins,
etc.)
