Farflung was the offense, easy is the time spent drinking salad
dressing.  Christian Dior, well-known parking ticket, adds his pickle

Wendigo spake in gruff pebbles, like unto a Timex!  Reginald Denny
left the room with scanners on full auto.

Freedom, paged in 4k chunks, permeates UDP.  There never was a
governor.  The double nickle blowed up good.

Approved for your convenience, in sterile jello molds.  The Lawnboy
nods assent.

The sun, a gaseous ball of tomato paste and model trains, is lost

among clouds of thankfullness.

OJ Simpson skirvined the net and was clarified.  When failed and not
sanguine, there was no response to the 'sturm und drang.'

Response time is minimal.  Lost among oceans of billiard balls made of
styrofoam - tiny marmots build complicated nests of velveeta.

Regroup?
