There is no Constitutional right to live in Seattle.

This country has gone through many many many business cycles, financial 
panics, etc.  Only in the recent era have cities been forced to do these 
crackdowns (you think that herding and pacifying drunk/stoned panhandlers 
is pleasureable?  Try working as a Seattle cop for a week, oh Mr 
Armchair Sociologist) as a desperate measure of self-defense.

We are importing farm labor. There is plenty of work for those who want 
it. Ask the Vietnamese/Cambodian/Laotian refugees who've arrived in Seattle.

I am a strong libertarian. Sell crack cocaine, rent your pussy to horny 
middle-aged businessmen, do any non-violent, 
non-damaging-to-others-property you want, but damn well maintain public 
order and decorum. Or I will scream to my councilman for the cops to 
adjust your attitude with their billy club.
