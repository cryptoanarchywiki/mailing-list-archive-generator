Since this thread has continued I would like to start my comments
by making a public apology to David Sternlight for my bad manners
the other day. He had done nothing to give me cause for my bad
attitude. I was rude and expressed myself poorly. I apologize to
him in particular and to the list in general.

A good point, my views are based/biased by being a Chicago based
Ameritech (RBOC) employee.

DISCLAIMER: all opinions are my own, I do not speak for Ameritech
or it's alliance partners.

 I agree 100%, I expressed this poorly. I meant to say that
asynchronous packet data was more efficent over a packet network,
and synchronous data (like voice) was more efficient over a circuit
switched network. I share your admiration of ISDN.

One of the problems with a conversion to ADSL here would be that
most point to point copper has been replaced with "slick 96" muxes
which use 4 framed T-1's (1.536 mbs) to provide 96 voice channels.
It is difficult to run 6mbs over a 56kbs channel. ;) Of course this
equipment could be replaced. (maybe just new line cards!) The good
news is that it is fiber based.

You are correct, actually fast is always the wrong term to use
since we are always refering to a portion of the speed of light.
Because of different technologies and bandwidth some devices have
faster data throughput.

Yes, this is the point I was trying to express.

Yes, we should always check the alternatives, but lets face it if
we have to redo the infrastructure, and redig 250 million trenches,
I feel 100% fiber is the way to go.

Jim, the above quote was by me not Remo Pini. I was giving a rough
figure for new underground fiber, and yes when we have to install
new we always lay extra tubes. The information your contractor
friend gave you was very accurate.

There is still a great need for new fiber, we are still installing
it at a rate of a billion dollars a year.
