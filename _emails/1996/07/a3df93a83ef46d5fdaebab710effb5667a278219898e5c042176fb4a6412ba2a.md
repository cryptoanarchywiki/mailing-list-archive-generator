That was not a complaint -- but a modest report <g>. Anyway, the major
countries which are to complaint about the US pressure are Japanese,
Australians, and Scandinavian countries, which are less keen to let
intelligence agencies controling individuals or industry secrets. France
and the UK, however, are sitting side by side with the US.

But I can add that my source is from the US :-) And that US business
circles around OECD discussions think no international guidelines could
emerge after any OECD meeting.
