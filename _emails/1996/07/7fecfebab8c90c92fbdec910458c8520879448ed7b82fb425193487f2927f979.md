An alternative to exporting a strong Netscape might be to build a 
browser outside the USA with a strong SSL.

Mosaic source can be licensed, correct?  What's to stop a non-US 
company from licensing it and modifying it to have strong crypto, 
then making that version freely available as shareware, or perhaps 
with non-crypto goodies locked out in the free version?  Or even 
selling it commercially with strong crypto?
