	good "white paper."

	modularity is the key.  use of standardized encryption libraries 
    permitting user selection of one or more formats.

	message pools would be great from satellite channels --how do you 
    regulate (read this as "pay for") since someone must receive the messages to 
    uplink?  -otherwise you have the dropouts of USENET.

	user interface is the achilles heel for most programmers --the time is 
    spent making the code 'work.'  with the tools available which allow multi-
    platform development, the *functional* GUI should be done by someone who
    creates "artitstic" interfaces.

	I agree-- if encryption can be made so simple, and with a clean user 
    interface, it will be used by joe sixpack (who rarely likes uncle, anyway 
    --but for different reasons). once joe sixpack starts to use (probably 
    dropping his private keys...), then it is too pervasive to stop --even if 
    there are a few high level prosecutions.

	one of our greatest failings v/v encryption as a group (including 
    coderpunks) is we are satisfied with our access to encrytion. PGP is a 
    nusiance, and the instructions are not clear --so we experiment until we get 
    the results: on the command line.  

	our satisfaction makes us insular; we need to think in global terms --mass 
    marketing of a free product which will hold appeal for everyone.  encryption 
    is no different than the students in China --no, they do have it, but how long 
    can Father Deng (and his successors) hang on against technology and quest for 
    knowledge?

Fuck off, Uncle Sam. Cyberspace is where democracy lives!
