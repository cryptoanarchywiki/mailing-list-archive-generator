     AN OPEN INVITATION TO THE INTERNET COMMUNITY FROM MEMBERS OF
     THE SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE
     
     July 23, 1996
     
     This week, the Senate Commerce Committee will take a historic step 
     forward toward enhancing citizens participation in the democratic 
     process via the Internet.  On Thursday July 25 the Committee's hearing 
     on S. 1726, the "Pro-CODE" Act of 1996 will be cybercast live on the 
     Internet.
     
     As many of you are well aware, the debate over US encryption policy is 
     of vital importance to the future development of the Internet and the 
     privacy of all Americans.   We are writing to invite you to join us in 
     this unique event. And to help the Committee better understand your 
     concerns about privacy and security on the Internet, we are inviting 
     you to submit your thoughts for the hearing record via the World Wide 
     Web and to discuss the issues with us and members of our staff live 
     online during the hearing.
     
     Information on how you can join the cybercast, submit your thoughts 
     for the record, and participate in an online discussion with 
     encryption experts, members of the committee, and other concerned 
     individuals are available at:
