You got one too...  I recieved one in the mail with no return address.
There is another poster in that series which says "A good marketing
organization listens to its customers... WE HEAR YOU!".  The woman is being
tapped by the same two government agents.

The posters are done by Tom Tommorow, who also does a cartoon called "This
Modern World" which appears far too infrequently in a number of papers and
_Processed World_.  Incredible political cynicysm...

Thanks again to RSA for a couple of cool posters!
