I guess I should look again, but I *thought* our licenses explicitly
excepted use of "US-Only" software (defined in the license) from the
standard exclusions.  I think the attys lifted some of the definitions
straight from ITAR and may have quoted 22USC.  Maybe we screwed
up and got the wrong license in the beta and missed the check.
I don't know.  I'll look.  *sigh*

As far as company policy goes, it's a good bet that we won't
willingly break any laws.  Licensing export-restricted software
to a "foreign person" (includes companies, etc) without a
particular export license would probably be a mistake which would
get corrected quickly.

We have made some mistakes. Occasional known distribution 
errors have occured, and in each case we do what the law
says: notify ODTC, and do whatever we can to clean up.  Nothing
big and nasty has come up and I think ODTC has been fine with us.
To my knowledge, every cleanup attempt has been met with cooperation
from all hands involved.
