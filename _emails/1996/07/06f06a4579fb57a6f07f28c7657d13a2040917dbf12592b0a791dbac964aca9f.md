    "See through cloths", wasn't there an ad in the back of comic books
for a pair of sunglasses that did the same thing. And did these same
sources mention how a bottle of lens solution with wired up Casio watch
attached to it would not be considered conspicuous? If you want to bring
down a plane just go to the courier services at the office blocks with
a parcel for across the country, us a gps reciever with preset co-ordinates
and when the plane gets there, ooopppss. If you want high tech thats the way
to go.
