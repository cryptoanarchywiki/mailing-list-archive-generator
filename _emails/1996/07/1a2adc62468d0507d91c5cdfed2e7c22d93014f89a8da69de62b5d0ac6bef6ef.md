All right, $100 to the winner, by the end of 1996,
for a reasonably-convincingly-non-rigged public crack of DES,
whether it's from a net-run or screen-saver effort,
a DES cracker using fancy special equipment, supercomputers,
microcomputers, DES chips, or Gate Array chips.
$100 extra bonus if the winner is from the NSA or FBI 
(Black-bag jobs, rubber-hose cryptanalysis, and subpoenas
all count as rigged - sorry :-)

Perhaps cracking 56-bit DES would count as a new bug for Netscape's
existing Bugs Bounty?
