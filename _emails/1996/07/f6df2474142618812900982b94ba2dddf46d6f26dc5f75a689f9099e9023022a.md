We have almost completed our SSL 3.0 implementation, and are looking for the 
specs on Fortezza DSS and KEA and would like to know where it is available.

>From the US National Security Agency.
As another respondee said, the details of KEA are not available, but information
on implementation of the protocol is.  It's in the public domain.
