Are these really "new" challenges?

You haven't lived in a hurricane prone area and lost your 
electricity for most of a month, have you?  Many of the generators
are already in place.  The power grid is not centralised, so it's difficult
to take down everything for a long period of time (long enough to be 
truly detrimental to a lot of people) quickly enough (that would require
some non-informational real-life bombing and warfare).

Is it so easy to take a whole network down?  What about various radio 
operations (HAMs, Marineband, FM, etc.)?  And don't forget 
automobiles and roads as last-resort communications.

I'm skeptical of that figure (many institutions maintain several 
printouts and have contingencies to do things by hand... for no 
other reason than computers go down without human interference).

Not really. Automobiles and buses rely on very little.  In major 
disasters there are ways to keep limited air and train traffic 
running.

You sound as if you have not been in a place hit by natural disasters 
such as earthquakes, hurricanes, major floods, etc.  These cause much 
more damange to infrastructures as well as human life than any 
organized action could, save for an all-out physical war.  Life still 
manages to go on.

Isn't that what FEMA is for?  Do you want FEMA involved with the 
'net?  Or would you rather get the DoD, NSA, FBI also involved with 
"Emergency Management"?!?

That still implies empowering the state rather than allowing entities 
(individuals and corporations) to protect themselves.

I'm skeptical of much of the InfoWar hype.

Yes, there are important security issues (data integrity and 
preservation).  But these also cross over with non-info disaster
preparations.

I also question whether large corporations and banks have compatible 
interests with individuals.  It seems entirely possible that measures 
could be taken to protect the former at the expense of the latter.
It's also dangerous to give LEA's another bogeyman to use. Very 
dangerous.
