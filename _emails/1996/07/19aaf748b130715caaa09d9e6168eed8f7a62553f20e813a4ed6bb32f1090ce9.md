Does anyone know of a hard-drive encryption program that has been ported to both DOS and Linux/UNIX based systems? I'm looking into installing some flavor of UNIX on my system, but still wish to retain my DOS based setup. Windows support would be a bonus, though not necessary.

Your help will be greatly appreciated.
