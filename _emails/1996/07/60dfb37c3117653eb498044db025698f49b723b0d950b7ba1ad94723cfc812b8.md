And? After all, when Coca Cola offers only one formula for Coke (these
days, at least) and yet keeps the formula a treade secret, is this not
similiarly restrictive of "choice"? The fact is that consumers never have
full freedom about what other agents or companies offer to trade to them.

Magazines, newspapers, and other such sources routinely make editorial
decisions about what to cover. And no, they do not necessarily publicize
the inner workings of their editorial process.

Are we to be "scared" that "Newsweek," for example, has their own filters
and is a multinational corporation (gulp)? "Newsweek" has many secrets of
their own; the most recent being that their own Joe Klein was the author of
the anonymous novel "Primary Colors," and the publisher knew it.

People and companies have their own agendas, their own filters, and their
own reasons for doing things they do. Get used to it.
