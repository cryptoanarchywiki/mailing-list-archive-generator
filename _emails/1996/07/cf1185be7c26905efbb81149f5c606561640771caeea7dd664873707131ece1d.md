Yes, this makes sense.  As I said before, this is related to the way
timing attacks work.  A little correlation that shouldn't be there,
over many messages, turns out to be enough to unravel a lot of
information.

At the very least, this is susceptible to a flooding attack.  At any
rate, this is analogous to the fixed-delay solution to timing
attacks.  (Make all PK operations with long-term secret keys take
the same amount of time.)  Unfortunately, I can't see a solution to
this that's analogous to blinding out the values in the timing
attacks.
