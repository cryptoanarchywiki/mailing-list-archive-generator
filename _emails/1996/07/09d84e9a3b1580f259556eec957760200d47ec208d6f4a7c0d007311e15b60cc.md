	How about generalized FPGA boards? Some applications in computational
biology (searching for similar genes or proteins using FASTA, etcetera) use
those quite a bit - and they're available for only about 20,000 or so for quite
a few high-level FPGA chips on a board. We've been looking into getting one
such and renting its use out on the Web, but the initial investment costs are
beyond what available grants will cover; maybe later. Given that at Rutgers is
one of the people doing whole bunches of stuff on Web security - namely Simon
Cooper - it should't be too difficult. But that will be at least a year or so.
