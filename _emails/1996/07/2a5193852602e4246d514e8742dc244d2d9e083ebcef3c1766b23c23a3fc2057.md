     I wasn't condoning boobytrapping, I was arguing that a claymore is 
a bit on the explosive side for use in a house (the thing has about a

      There are other stories where the perp gets it _in_the_act_ and still
gets awarded damages. Fucking country is going to the dogs and there ain't 
nowhere else to go.
