That sounds like an excellent deal when I plan to purchase it, but I would
like to see if there is a crippleware demo first.  I already have had 2.6.2
configured with a Windows clipboard utility.  I just want to see if the full
Win/integrated clipboard feature is more efficient.  Thanks Joseph!
P.S. I am also erleg@sdinter.net, but Majordomo won't unsubscribe me because
I don't seem to be on the 'who cypherpunks' list, but my old address is
still mysteriously reeiving the list.  Any hints?  Yes, I wrote
owner-cypherpunks with no reply.  TIA!
