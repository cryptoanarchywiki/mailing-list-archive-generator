Nice in theory. Awful in practice.  Requires code for managing keys, 
encrypting and decrypting for ea. algorithm be resident in memory.  
For some systems (MSDOS), free memory is at a premium... (one of the 
reasons SecureDrive is popular is because it takes only 2.5k).  It's 
not worth wasting memory for handling several algorithms when only 
one is going to be used in most cases.

Ok...

So much for maintaining code across platforms.

Not worthwhile.  Use a Stacker or JAM driver over the encrypted 
partition on a PC, for instance.  Keep compression and crypto 
separate utilities... keeps bugs from one interfering with another 
and reduces complexity of both drivers; also, if one wants crypto 
w/out compression or compression w/out crypto, no wasted memory (see 
above about RAM being at a premium).

> - Ability to chain algorithms (IDEA and then 3DES for example)

Why?  Doesn't necessarily increase security, esp. considering the 
performance hit (memory... see above, time, key management).

Nothing new there.

A common problem with much crypto these days.

Do you understand how such systems work?!?  Every sector is 
encrypted in such systems.  That's not even an issue for most 
encrypted file systems (at least on the PC).

Huh?!?

If the algorithm is good, this shouldn't matter.  The only way a 
person could tell if a sector is unused is if that person was able to 
mount the partition already.

Now this is getting nutty!!!  Never mind the size, compleixty and 
amazing slowness of such a driver...  you'd have to have audio or video
files of gigabytes in size to be able to store anything of use.

Why?  The authorities would wonder why you have an 8 Gig JPG on your 
disk and figure you're using it for stego, or you're crazy, or both, 
and have you committed.
