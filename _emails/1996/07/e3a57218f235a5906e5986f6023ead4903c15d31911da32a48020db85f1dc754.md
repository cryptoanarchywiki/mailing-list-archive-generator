But not how much money was taken, or from which accounts.

Not all of them anyway.

Although, the cypherpunks probably know how many, just not who.  That or
they know some of the names, but can't prove it, and don't know if there
are more.

Definatly.

True.

But that doesn't, unless _everybody_ did it.

The money is in a numbered account, and will be transfered equaly to other
numbered accounts.

heh.

Sence nobody knows who's involved anyway, its really a matter of who
controls the numbered account.
