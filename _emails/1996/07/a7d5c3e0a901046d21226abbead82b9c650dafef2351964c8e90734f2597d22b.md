And let's not forget the Chinese.  Unarmed Chinese laborers 
where often robbed in 1849 California.  The existance and
vitality of San Francisco's Chinatown has been attributed to
the fact that--unlike their rural cousins--the SF Chinese
community armed itself with guns in response to racially
motivated violence against them.  The lived and prospered;
other, unarmed, California Chinese communities did not.
