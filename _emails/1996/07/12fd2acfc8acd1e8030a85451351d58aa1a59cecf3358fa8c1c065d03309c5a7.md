I must disagree with Tim on this issue.  Back in the dark ages, before the
revolution, the Yankee was an insult used by British sympathisers to
describe the hick American revolutionaries.  The Americans adopted it as a
matter of pride and threw it back in their detractors face.  

Homosexuals are doing the same thing with the them "queer".  When I went to
Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema's class in Internet Security, Dan taught the
class wearing a tank-top which said "QUEER" across the front.

People with pride in themselves and what they do can make their detractors
eat their insults.  We should make it clear that "nerd," "dweeb," "geek,"
"jerk," etc. are where the money is.  We should turn them into terms of
pride in what we are and what we do.
