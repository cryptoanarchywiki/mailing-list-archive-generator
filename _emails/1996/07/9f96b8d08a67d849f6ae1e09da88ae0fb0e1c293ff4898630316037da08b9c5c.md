Errrrr.

Ever hear of home schooling?

Seems like if your child needs drugs to go to school than perhaps school is
the problem not that your child's body lacks Ritalin.

Sheesh.

So it happens that I was talking with a fellow Saturday who grew up on
Ritalin. He's 36 now and strung out. Life with Ritalin prepared him for
drugs, you know. They were natural. Like the body is made for different
laboratory made molecules with dubious effects. He never got into the hard
stuff (like the opiates) like the anti-drug people promised though. Also
turns out that he now has a neurological disorder that is untreatable and
uncurable. So now he's goes through his days in constant pain courtesy of
the best childhood his wealthy Pacific Palisades Parents could buy. 

I wonder if there are any other Ritalin side affects that don't become
prominent until 30 years later?

But than someone who thinks milk is wholesome needs some lessons is
nutrition, anatomy and physiology.
