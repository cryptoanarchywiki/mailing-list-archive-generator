Good argument, but I think you're still paying more.
Some have made the argument that the cost of manufacture 
of a CD is less (I wouldn't know).  Most people pay considerably
more taxes for that new platter, too. Sales tax is 6% or more now,
was 2-3% then for most people, other taxes have gone way up too.  You
probably had to earn $28 to bring home that $16 cd.
