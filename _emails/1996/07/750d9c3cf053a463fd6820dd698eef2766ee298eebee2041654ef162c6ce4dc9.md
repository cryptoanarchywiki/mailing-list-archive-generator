There would be a development kit or version of the OS for developers 
that doesn't require signatures.

Problems are that forgeign developers will want this, and they'll cry 
foul if they can't get ahold of it.  Another problem is that it might 
be bootlegged or pirated if enough people do not trust the system, or 
if adequate software if not available.
