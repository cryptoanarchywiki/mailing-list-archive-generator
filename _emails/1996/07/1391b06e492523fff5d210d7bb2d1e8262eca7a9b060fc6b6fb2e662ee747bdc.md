How about applets for java-aware pagers or tv-sets that will supposedly
show up in the near future?  When a crack is found, you can call a toll-free
number, give them the code, and win a prize (ala Chinese-lottery).

Would it be better to have them all try random keys rather than use 
assigned keyspaces?  Can't keysearches be shorted by half (not that 
it's that significant, 2^55 rather than 2^56) using complement  keys?

First thing one should check are the weak and semi-weak keys (a good 
implementation will avoid them, but that doesn't mean one shouldn't 
check for them).
