Another need is for file/disk-encryption utilities.  I'm not familiar 
with what's out there for Macs, but for PCs there's SFS and ASPICRYP
for SCSI drives (with no source!) and SFS, SecureDrive and SecureDevice
for HD (or FD).  The latter won't work on Win95. AFAIK, SFS and 
SecureDrive aren't 100% friendly with Win95 either, though they'll work.

There's a need for something that will work under Win95, WinNT, 
and/or OS/2 for encrypting partitions.  Aside from a few commercial 
or shareware apps which use some variant of DES, there's little out there.
(One problem is that DD kits for Win95/NT and OS/2 cost $$$.)
