Stated this way, I suppose strategy A is better than strategy B if after
an arbitrarily large number of trials, N(A>B) > N(B>A).

It is still unclear that such a notion translates smoothly into notions
like "lowest gas price", where buying once at a station that is half
the price beats buying a dozen times at a station that is only one 
cent less.  

It does translate perfectly well into the original problem of picking
subjectively beautiful women, however, which is also non-parametric in
a similar way.  It would be nice to see a short proof that for the
optimal solution, the threshold is the max of the first 1/e elements, 
and is not a function of how many steps have been taken.
