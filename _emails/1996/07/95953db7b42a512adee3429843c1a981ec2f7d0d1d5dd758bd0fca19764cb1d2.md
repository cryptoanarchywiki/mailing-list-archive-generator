Bill Stallings reports in 7-23-96 Network World on the IETF's proposals for
Net security: 
 
 
   Toward that end, the IETF last summer published five 
   security-related proposed standards -- RFC 1825 through RFC 
   1829 -- that define a security capability at the IP level. 
 
 
   IP-layer security encompasses two functional areas: 
   authentication and privacy. The authentication mechanism 
   assures that a received packet was, in fact, transmitted by 
   the party identified as the source in the packet header and 
   that the packet was not altered in transit. The privacy 
   facility enables communicating nodes to encrypt messages to 
   prevent eavesdropping by third parties.
