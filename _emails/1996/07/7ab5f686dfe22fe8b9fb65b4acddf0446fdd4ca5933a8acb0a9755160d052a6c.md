If there is anything worth complaining about, it is that there simply hasn't 
been a "debate" in this "important policy debate."  The pro-GAK few have 
consistently avoided appearing in a format in which a genuine debate can 
occur.  And I don't mean a question-and-answer scenario either, whether the 
questions are asked by Congress or the news media.  I'm talking about a REAL 
debate, one where the pro-GAK's can be seen to _lose_ by being torn to pieces.
