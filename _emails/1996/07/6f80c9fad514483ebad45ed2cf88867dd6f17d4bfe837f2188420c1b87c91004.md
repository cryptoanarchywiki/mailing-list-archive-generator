	And I say I don't care what they do with their lifes as long as
it doesn't affect mine. When someone smokes besides me and I have to breath
the smoke, s/he's affecting my health. When someone takes antibiotics s/he
doesn't need and selects resistant bacteria, that affects me. When someone
forces me into doing something, that affects me.

	All I ask is a say when whatever they do may harm me. If that's
being a busybody, I guess I am. Sorry if that upsets you.
