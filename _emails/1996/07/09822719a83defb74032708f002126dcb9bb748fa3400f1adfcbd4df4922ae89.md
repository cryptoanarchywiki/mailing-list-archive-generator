I echo Peter's thanks.  Netscape is helping us demonstrate a market for
strong, non-GAKed crypto.  This market exists in spite of what the GAK fans
say.

If the American people carefully considered the issues of GAK, I strongly
believe they would come down on the side of privacy, and not on the side of
total government access to communication.  That is why our government is
trying so hard to institute GAK thru international treaty, the path with
the least public input and scrutiny.
