Great idea. Get some (possibly) innocent techie in an oppressive 
country thrown in jail or executed.  Or perhaps s/he gets offended, 
contributing to the notion that all Westerners are evil perverts 
out to corrupt them.

Damn aggrevating for that user, and it could get him/her in trouble.

On a wide-scale it could provoke responses from those countries.  
Imagine this list being bombarded with propaganda, or perhaps 
somebody here looking at an anti-censorship web page getting 
pro-censorship messages from religious fundamentalists.

Or it could encourage them to use special firewalls which filter 
content and disallow graphics... (probably many US-based companies 
would be all-too-happy to sell them the software to do it), or even 
close themselves off from the Internet altogether, perhaps form 
separate, unconnected Family/Islamic/Chinese-values networks.
