The connection should be clear, but in case it is not: many soft targets
are Schelling points for terrorist actions.

Putting yourself in the mind of a terrorist or militia crazy or whatever,
where would you attack?

The Olympics, obviously. (And security officials of course see the same
Schelling point, hence the unprecedented security measures and presence.)

Given that most Olympic events are well-guarded, etc., what's the next
target to look at? Crowded public gatherings, where the "message" can still
be delivered and where security measures are problematic.

There are tens of thousands of such soft targets/Schelling points in an
"open society," and it is unreasonable to expect to defend each one of
them. (Costly, too.) And if they are so-defended, the attacker moves to
other targets.

Keep your head down.
