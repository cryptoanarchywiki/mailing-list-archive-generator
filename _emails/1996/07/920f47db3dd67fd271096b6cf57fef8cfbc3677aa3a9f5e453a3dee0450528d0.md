As an interesting point of comparison, the program "Soul Train," featuring
predominantly black music, has been in syndication for more than 25 years.
And it usually aired late at night.

(I learned this by watching a "Best of 'Soul Train'" program on VH1. The
show's creator and director pointed out that being on at 11 p.m. or 1 a.m.
made it tough for many of the show's fans to watch it.)

My point? Controversial material is often shoved to the end of a
programming schedule. This makes room for the "Wheel of Fortune" and
"Adam-12" shows in prime time.

I'm obviously not arguing for regulatory intervention in scheduling, for
either Limbaugh or "Soul Train," merely noting that shows with
strong-but-limited appeal often find themselves playing second fiddle to
"The Dating Game."

Yes, I think Limbaugh has "limited" appeal. I watched him a few times.
Sometimes funny, often controversial. But mostly for "dittoheads."
