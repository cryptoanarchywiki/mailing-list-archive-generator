As you can clearly see I did *not* suggest that the software needed to
be uploaded anonymously.  I agree that public disobedience has a much
large impact than private disobedience, but I think the value of private
disobedience is still positive.

Uploading critical software which computer users can access accross the
globe, important as it is, is not an ideal method of practicing (or
mispracticing if you prefer) Civil Disobedience.  The problem is that
only a single copy only needs to be uploaded and only one person really
gets "credit" for the upload.

Better is something like Vince Cate's "Arms Trafficker" page:
    http://online.offshore.com.ai/arms-trafficker/
I am there at #172 striking a tiny but not invisible blow for freedom.
