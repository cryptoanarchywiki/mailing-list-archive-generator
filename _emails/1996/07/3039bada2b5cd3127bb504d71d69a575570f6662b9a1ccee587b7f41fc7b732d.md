Another thing to do is get more web sites containing information of interest
to people living in such regimes on SSL enabled web servers.  If the web
redirectors can be set to redirect SSL traffic undisturbed, then there is
another level of encryption for the chinese to have to hack through to find
"dissidents".  And if someone could sneak them a few copies (hint...
hint...) of the 128 bit version, it would make their lives even more difficult.

I see a point where the repressive regimes of the world are going to be
trying to prevent their people from getting to information that is against
the regime, but getting run over by the shear volume of the information.  It
may be possible to filter for such things, but in doing so, you destroy any
usefulness the network has in the first place.

Of course this is all a moot point, because it has been proven by computer
projections that all informative net traffic will be buried under
advertisements by the year 2000 anyways.  I expect some legislative body to
try and make money fast on the net by selling ad space on IP packet headers.

I think I will go drink more coffee now...
