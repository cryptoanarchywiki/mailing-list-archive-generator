More details are available from MS' web pages at:
http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/apiext/capi4.htm
and:
http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/security/cryptapi.htm

I understand that NSA may have accepted the arrangement because only
signed CSP's will be loaded under the CAPI, and MS will only sign them in
Redmond. So, strong CSP modules developed outside the US will not be useable
there because, once gone to Redmond, won't be re-exportable. On the other
hand, I suspect that writing a binary-compatible CAPI emulator shouldn't
be that difficult. That would allow to use the same CAPI-compliant 
applications anywhere in the world, running over different 
implementations of the crypto engine.

The interesting part is that the basic, but crippled, CSP (PROV_RSA_FULL) 
will be supplied for free by MS:

--http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/apiext/capi4.htm -- 8< -----------
[...]
Microsoft licensed cryptographic technology from RSA Data Security to 
create the base or default software CSP that ships with the operating
system. The Microsoft RSA Base provider consists of a software 
implementation PROV_RSA_FULL provider type (see accompanying table of
provider types). This CSP supports both public-key and symmetric (or 
"conventional") cryptography. It is exportable and will ship everywhere
that the CryptoAPI is present.
[...]
------------------------------------------------------- 8< -----------

That should free the developers of secure application from the need of 
buying licences from RSADSI, at least for export-grade functionality.
