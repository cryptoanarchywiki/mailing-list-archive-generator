Someone did in fact.  There was a long article in _New York magazine a few
months ago, whose author did computer analysis of Klein's writings and the
novel and showed them to match. You may be able to find it in a library.

Don't feel sorry for Klein - he's a fucking statist who opposes freedom of
speech. If CBS fires the creep for lying, it'll serve him just right.
