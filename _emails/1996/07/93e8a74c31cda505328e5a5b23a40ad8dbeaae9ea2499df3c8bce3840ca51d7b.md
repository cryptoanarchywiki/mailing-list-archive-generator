     That family member is usually not killed in an accident. You are 
also more likely to be stabbed by a family member, beaten by a family 
member, raped by a family member, and stolen from by a family member. 

     Maybe we should outlaw families.

      This sir is pure crap. In fact it is far more likely that an armed 
and prepared occupant will take out a thug. There have been 2 cases here 
in Chicago where elderly citizens (one 86 years old, and in a wheelchair)
got the drop on teenage hooligans that were in the process of burglarizing
their homes (in the case of the 86 year old, sexual assault was also occuring)
In both cases at least on of the perps died. As they deserved too. 

      These people (burglars) are not worth the bullet it takes to get rid of 
them.
