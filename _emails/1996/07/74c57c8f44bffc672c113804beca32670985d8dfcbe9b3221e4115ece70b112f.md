At the risk of giving M$NBC more attention than it deserves...

BillG's latest misadventure editorializes on free/hate speech tonight at 7
and 10pm. Current and past fluffage at http://www.thesite.com/cgi/worl.cgi

There's also a blank message area for "Would you bank through your computer?
Do you think the technology is secure enough?" but no story. Maybe that's
tomorrow.
