This redacted and declassified high level memo outlining the linkage of
the Digital Wiretap bill and the Clipper initiative in the Bush
administration was recently obtained by EPIC (http://www.epic.org) as the
result of an FOIA request.

I tried to keep the original spacing and relative lengths of blacked-out
areas.

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE HONORABLE DICK CHENEY
		Secretary of Defense

		THE HONORABLE WILLIAM P. BARR
		Attorney General

		THE HONORABLE ROBERT M. GATES
		Director of Central Intelligence

 SUBJECT:       Legislative Strategy for Digital
		Telephony (S)

 On December 30, 1991, I sent to the President a memorandum
 seeking his approval for a legislative strategy for digital
 telephony.  The substance of that memorandum is attached.  On
 January 15, 1992, he approved the following course of action:

      -    Justice should go ahead now to seek a
	   legislative fix to the digital telephony
	   problem, and all parties should prepare to
	   follow through on the encryption problem in
	   about a year.  Success with digital telephony
	   will lock in one major objective; we will have
	   a beachhead we can exploit for the encryption
	   fix; and the encryption access options can be
	   developed more thoroughly in the meantime.  (TS)

 Background

 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXxXXXXXXXXXXXXX

 Analog technology allows interception of a single communication    <written>
 through a tap on the target's line XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX     Same
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  Digital technology simultaneously
 intermingles thousands of pieces of information on the line
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXe
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

 The best solution to this problem is to obtain legislation which
 ensures the cooperation of the telephone commXXXXXXXX providing
 access to target communications XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  All         Same
 agencies agree with this legislative approach and that we should
 do it fairly soon.  Preliminary soundings on the Hill suggest
 there is a reasonable chance of success even though these kinds
 of issues raise "civil liberties" issues with the attendant
 political fireworks.  A timely legislative vehicle is the FCC
 Authorization Bill which has passed the House and awaits action
 in the Senate.  We expect the Senate to take it up in January.

 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  The Justice view is that we should
 carefully press ahead and try to obtain a solution now.  Justice
 contends that the costs of waiting (loss of access and the cost
 to recoup) are growing rapidly, and an attempt to fix it now is
 worth the political risks.

 to seek a fix to the digital telephony problem and direct all the
 parties to prepare to follow through on encryption in about a
 year.
