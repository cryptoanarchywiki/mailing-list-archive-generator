Hey guys,

I just got a really cool poster from RSA.  It's a big circle split off 
into several sections showing people talking to each other, the upper 
right hand corner shows two NSA dweebs looking like Bevis & Butthead in 
suits, one smoking, the other seated infront of an old 60's reel to reel 
audio tape recorder, a sign on the wall behind them says "Key Escrow"

There are several logos for various government agencies including our 
friends at No Such Agency and the FBI, a small quote next to the 
Copyright (C) RSA notice says "One of a series of public relations 
posters that never made it out of Fort Mede."  Very very funny!

Many many thanks to the cool person(s) at RSA who sent it my way.
