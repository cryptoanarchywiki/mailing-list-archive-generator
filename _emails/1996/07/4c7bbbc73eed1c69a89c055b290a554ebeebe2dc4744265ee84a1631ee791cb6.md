I chuckled when this whole Cybank thing started.  Only a month or so
ago, they had some funky bug in their mail system such that all their
internal email was being cc'd to the First Virtual users' mailing list
(and also to one poor individual).  They were helpless and completely
unable to figure it out, as we watched their (not very happy) internal
messages float unrequested into our mailboxes.
