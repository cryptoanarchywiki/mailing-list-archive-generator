[Anyone know more about this one? "Homonymous" in this context sounds a
tad oily.]

: 10 lines description:
: 
: Enkryptonator is a newly developed encryption system based on the
: principles of homonymous key cryptography invented by Enkryptonator Co.
: Homonymous key systems are an exiciting, new breakthrough, that solve
: the 'key management' problem without resorting to 'public key'
: cryptography. No more unwieldy, impossible to remember, binary keys.
: Enkryptonator is easy to use.  Because of Enkryptonator's unique design
: no one who intercepts your encryption in an unauthorized manner can
: decrypt your file -- even if he knows the key of encryption! Everyone
: has a right to privacy and Enkryptonator will provide you a means of
: securing your personal and private concerns from unwanted intruders.
: 
: Long description:
: 
: This is the 1.3 International Shareware version of Enkryptonator.
: The international version will only allow a single key of encryption
: in order prevent running a-foul of US export control regulations on
: the export of encryption technology.
: 
: Version 1.3 introduces a 5% speed improvement and minor changes in
: messaging.  Version 1.3 is incompatible with version 1.2 and version
: 1.1.  These are the only code changes.  The most significant reason for
: releasing 1.3 is to provide users with more comprehensive and updated
: user documentation.
