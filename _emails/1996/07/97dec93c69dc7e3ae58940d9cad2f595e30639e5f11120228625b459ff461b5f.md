I mean actual ability to read and write *meaningfully*.  Not the official
"literacy" handed out in thousands of local institutions designed to produce
mental retardation in this country.  It is a skill almost are capable of
(most had it in 1856 -- we know this because we can read the Lincoln-Douglas
debates), but monopoly government institutions can no more make genuine
literacy than they can make decent steel.

H.L. Mencken (always an optimist) said that a significant improvement in the
quality of American education could only be achieved if you dynamited all
the schools and shot all the teachers.

Whether that is true or not.  The governments have had the minds of our
children since 1870 or so.  If they haven't done a better job than this
perhaps it is time to retire them.
