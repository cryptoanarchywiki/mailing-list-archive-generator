I did not yell at you. Bear in mind that there are many subscribers, with
many views of what is interesting and what is important to talk about.

There are only so many times that a particular thread can be talked about
meaningfully, and some of the more crypto-related threads (which no one is
stopping anyone from starting!) have covered the same ground through dozens
of cycles. Thus, while "Where can I get SFS to encrypt my hard drive?," as
an example, may _seem_ to be list-relevant than discussions of Ritalin and
the use of it in public schools for behavior modification, I think the
former thread is "tired," and generates little response, where the latter
thread has obviously generated a lot of responses. This speaks for itself,
as I see it.

But, then, I view the list as partly a social community of reasonably
like-minded folks, with a shared interest in several obvious things, and
not just a place to discuss C++ code or where to find SFS and PGP.

Personally, I'm just as glad the list is not a clone of Libernet or
Commienet, but most political threads die out quickly enough. The "Ritalin"
thread will die out eventually, In the meantime, it appears to interest
quite a few people, and some readers may not have previously known that the
public schools are sending out the message of "Just say "No!" to drugs!"
while simultaneously using mind-control drugs to dose kids into submission.

Sort of like the Feds calling for strict controls on privacy technology
while freely passing around confidential FBI dossiers of their political
enemies. The foxes guarding the henhouses.

All of these examples are useful for our agenda.
