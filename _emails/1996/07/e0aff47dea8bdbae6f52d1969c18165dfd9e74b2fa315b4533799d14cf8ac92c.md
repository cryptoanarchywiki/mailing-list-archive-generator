I am sure the final release will be exported the day you release it. The
government will not go after you because some third party violated the law.
Remember, even PRZ was only harassed, never charged. It is my opinion, and
that of many of the legal folks on this list, that the ITAR are
unconstitutional. Netscape is being intimidated by a bluff. And no, I do
not fault Netscape for not forcing the issue.

Sure. The feds are learning. They know that they can't prevent export. They
even know that their regulations don't have a leg to stand on. But they
also know that they can make the life difficult for anyone wanting to make
strong crypto available domestically , thereby reducing the number of
shrink wrap quality programs available for domestic users. Which, let there
be no mistake, is the true reason for the ITAR including software crypto.
