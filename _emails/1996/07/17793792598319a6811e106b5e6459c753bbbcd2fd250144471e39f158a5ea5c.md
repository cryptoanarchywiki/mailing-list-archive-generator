Hmm, I though Rich Graves was a Nazi, but now the Nazis reject him too. :-)

You, postmaster@c2.org, postmaster@stanford.edu and
news.admin.net-abuse.misc were notified about forged cancels by you
against others.  Did you stop since?

Your practice of posting to a lot of newsgroups with a followup-to
line for an "enemy" newsgroup, is the classic practice of trolling.
Most of the newsreaders wont see the rebuttals, and presume that
your post was unchallenged, so inspiring a rebuttal with the same
arguments that have already been made.  You've not stopped
regardless of the number of complaints.

Your practice of forging your e-mail address away from your true
e-mail address is also net abuse.  This is an obvious taking
advantage of sameer@c2.net, a net hero, the admin of your ISP,
that you are maliciously taking advantage of to avoid complaints
of your actual e-mail address, llurch@stanford.edu, whom you
work for.

Whoever "Skippy" is, she has not forged cancels since March 1996,
and has never done the other abuses you deal out in prolific
quantity.  Are you going to stop these three net abuses because
of yet another complaint?  You haven't before.
