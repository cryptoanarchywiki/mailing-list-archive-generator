I must violently agree.

Having escrowed video cameras in every room in every house will surely
deter violence in the homes as most child and spousal abuse are (no big
surprise) done by family.  But even such horrors as child rape and
beating cannot justify video cameras in every room; not because it is
expensive, but because it is a gross violation of privacy.  (But the
FBI promises it would not use it without a court order, right?  Sure.)

People, in general, understand the severity of "video escrow".  They
just do not understand the severity of "key escrow" yet.
