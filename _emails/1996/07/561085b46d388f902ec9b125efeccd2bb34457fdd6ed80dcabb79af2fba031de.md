	Me too. In fact, citing "freedom fighters" to justify relaxing ITAR is
neither more nor less disingenuous than citing "international arms traders"
to justify maintaining or tightening it; and given the litany of imbecilic,
corrupt, rump, and reactionary regimes and factions the US has supported
over the past decades, it isn't exactly going to win over hearts and minds
in the agencies that have a strong hand in ITAR.
