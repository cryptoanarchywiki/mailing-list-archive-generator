Multimedia Data Security

The growth of the use of public networks as the platform for multimedia
applications in the past year has made it important to devise
mechanisms for ensuring proper use of intellectual property and
increased the importance of employing security mechanisms for video and
audio data. This conference will serve as a forum for the exchange of
ideas in the areas of security systems and mechanisms especially in
applications that handle large data volumes.

Papers are solicited in all areas of security systems and algorithms
including but not limited to:

- security systems for imaging applications 
- security systems for real time video applications 
- performance studies and comparisons for securing image data 
- watermarking and detection of fraudulent copying of intellectual property 
- metering schemes for intellectual property usage 
- audio and video encryption mechanisms 
- key management and security protocols for broadcast applications 
- payment systems for online multimedia applications 
- content protection mechanisms for online multimedia distribution. 

Please submit abstracts to Bill Johnston (johnston@george.lbl.gov)
by August 15, 1996.
