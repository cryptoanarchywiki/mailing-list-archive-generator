Clearly, some of us aren't exhibiting the proper sensitivity to the
feelings of others.  This can't continue.

But it will.

So, live with it.

Maybe we could have a cypherpunk nanny who exhorts niceness from a bully
pulpit, but please can we keep it to one nanny?  May it could be a
rotating honor.

Flame away, nannies.
