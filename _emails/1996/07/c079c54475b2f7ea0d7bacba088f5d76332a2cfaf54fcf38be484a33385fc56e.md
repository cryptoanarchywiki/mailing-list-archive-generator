I agree with Raph's analysis, that for something like RSA encryption
to work, you need to have a strong public key infrastructure, and that
the Gov't could probably build one that people would use; and that would
destroy their privacy.

My prediction, though, is that because Diffie-Hellmann loses its patent
protection so soon, in just over a year now, that RSA, or any persistent-key
system, will not tend to be used for e-mail, phone conversations, or other
types of communication; for D-H, no infrastructure need be in place.
Now, it's true that you can't use D-H for authentication, and that is
a tremendous disadvantage.  Still, you could use the established
gov't PKI to do the authentication, and use D-H for the exchange of
keys.
