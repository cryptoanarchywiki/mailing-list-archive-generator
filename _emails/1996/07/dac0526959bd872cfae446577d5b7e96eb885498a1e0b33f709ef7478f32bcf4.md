Semi-plausible. (See my other reply to this: an attacker could get 
ahold of the HD and your system, reverse engineer the driver used, to 
see what you're doing; backups of the encrypted partition in case of 
destructive measures are helpful ... they could even return your 
computer to you and take it apart carefully.)

The problem with a duress key is that it relies on "security through 
obscurity".
