I dunno, are you a nob?

As I recall I said the expenses where going to be in the switches (or public
networks).

Plus I'm thinking the most basic services of telnet, ftp, smtp, and some
nnp...

Plug two network boards (whether ethernet or X.25 or ATM) into a UNIX
computer and you have a router.

You cannot tell me that hardware (minus the hardcore ATM/X.25 stuff) is not
inexpensive enough to put something together.  At least for a few thousand
users all sophisticated enough to know how to install a UNIX or Linux
system... I'm talking about a club here - not a replacement for the internet.

Open up your mind, dude....
