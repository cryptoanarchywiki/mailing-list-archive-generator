That's why the IFS SDK is so important. Writing device drivers is one thing
and nasty at that but the IFS is higher level and exactly what is needed to
create a PGPDrive that could exist on scsi, ide, tape, network drives,
floppies, cd-roms, etc. A device driver implementation would be married to a
particular controller type.
