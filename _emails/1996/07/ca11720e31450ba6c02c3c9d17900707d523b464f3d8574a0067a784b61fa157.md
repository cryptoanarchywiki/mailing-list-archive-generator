Coffee usage seconded here...I've tapered down to about two pots or so
a day from four or more, due to the tolerance I was developing. It's
about the only thing that gets anything done on time.  While I can
understand and agree with Tim and Mike's points about government control
and "making creative people fit in", there is a point where creativity 
is the only thing possible, to the exclusion of all else, such as paying
bills on time, doing necessary work, or just interacting with others.
