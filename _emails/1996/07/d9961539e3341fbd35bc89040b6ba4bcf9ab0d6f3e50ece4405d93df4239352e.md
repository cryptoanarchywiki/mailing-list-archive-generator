Stimulants tend to have an odd effect on children.  Instead of making them
more active, they tend to do just the opposite.  (My daughter used to have
that problem with caffiene.  Used to put her to sleep.)

This makes the situation even more scary, considering how little is known
about the brain chemistry of growing children.  I am expecting the long term
effects of these drugs will be "interesting".  (And not in a good way.)  I
know a woman who was tranq'ed as a kid.  She is nice and sweet, cannot dream
at all, and is a total and unrepentant sociopath.  Your results may vary.
