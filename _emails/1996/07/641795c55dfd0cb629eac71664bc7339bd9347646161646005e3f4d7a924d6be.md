But how long?  I don't doubt that the effects you describe will occur, but 
I'm only talking about a _semi_-permanent installation.  My guesstimate 
(months) was based on the idea that the fiber would be short (say, less than 
a kilometer)enough so that even accelerated loss (microcracking) wouldn't 
appreciably degrade the transmission.  Also, I'm assuming that the fiber 
would be hung with enough slack so that swaying/growing trees wouldn't 
stretch the fiber appreciably.

They can tap a fiber by bending it over a small radius, which causes leakage 
around the OD without appreciably interrupting the signal.  Changes are 
pretty good that this would b
e the technology used.
