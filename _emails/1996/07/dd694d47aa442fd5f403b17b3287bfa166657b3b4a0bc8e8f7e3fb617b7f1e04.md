[for some reason this went out without my comments earlier]

From:  Mike Duvos

Of course, no amount of reason will disuade the True Believers from
embracing yet another disease model, and we shouldn't expect that it 
would.  But I think it is clear to many people that the forced medication
of children for the convenience of those who take care of them is
getting a bit out of control.
