While the psychiatric profession has invented many bogus diseases, that does
not mean that the profession has no credibility.  Remember that psychology is
little more than philosophy.  Abnormal behavior patterns don't necessarily mean
that a child has a disorder or disease.  However, if the child experiences
physical symptoms, then a chemical imbalance in the brain is not that
farfetched.

First of all, a child is considered to have "school phobia" when the child
refuses to go to school and also has severe anxiety attacks, vomiting, and
nausea.  It's a lot more than refusing to go to a "crappy public school."
Attention Deficit Disorder is hardly nonsense; it's a disorder found to be
partly hereditary and strongly linked with clinical depression.

I do agree that Ritalin, like Prozac, is being used inappropriately as a sort
of cure-all drug.  And I also agree that inventing malodies for anything
undesirable to society has Orwellian implications.  Everyone who doesn't agree
with the State is obviously mentally ill and must be "cured."

There are real illnesses, and there are fake ones.  Just because the psychiatic
profession does attribute certain behavior to some non-existent illness doesn't
mean there is any reason to not believe in any psychological maladies.  There
are many severe and very painfull illnesses such as depression,
schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and multiple personality
disorder.  There are also psychological disorders such as anorexia, phobias,
and mood disorders.  It's surprising to me that people consider the Unabomber
"insane" but yet do not believe that many very real mental illnesses and
disorders exist.
