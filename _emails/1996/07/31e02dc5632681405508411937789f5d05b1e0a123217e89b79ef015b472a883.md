The Future of Consumer Electronic Payments:  The Impact on the Distribution
Chain

Gregory Schmid, Institute For The Future

        This talk explores the critical changes pushing consmers into the
world of electronic transactions--improved technologies, better security,
and consumers' growing experience with card-based and other electronic
transaction technologies.  These changes will not only affect customer
behaviors, but will transform the distribution chain, bring in new players,
force the current players to fundamentally transform the way they conduct
business, and encourage policymakers to find the right balance of
regulation and market forces.
        Combined, these impacts will change the basic relationship between
businesses and their customers forever.  Only the stakeholders who are
prepared for such changes will carve out their place in the new world.

Greg directs IFTF's long-term forecasting and strategic planning efforts in
both the public and private sectors.  He has been Director of IFTF's
Corporate Associates Program (CAP) since its inception in 1976 and is also
the overall editor of CAP's "Ten-Year Forecast."  Greg has overseen
projects for many Fortune 500 companies, including those in the financial
services, high technology, consumer products, professional services, and
healthcare industries.  As an economist, historian, and policy analyst,
Greg uses a variety of research and planning techniques to work with
clients in exploring strategic choices.  His most recent book is "Future
Tense: The Business Realities of the Next Ten Years" (William Morrow, 1994)
with Ian Morrison.  Before joining IFTF Greg headed a research division of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  A graduate of Yale, Greg received
his Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University.

are located in the Stanford Research Park, between Page Mill Road (west of
Foothill Expressway) and Hillview Avenue.  The easiest way to get here is
to take Page Mill Road to Coyote Hill Road, and, as you drive up Coyote
Hill between the horse pastures, PARC is the only building on the left
after you crest the hill.  Please park in the large (lower) lot to your
right; enter the auditorium at the upper level of the building.  (The
auditorium entrance is located to the left of the main door and down the
stairs.)
