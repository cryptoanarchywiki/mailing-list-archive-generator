Obviously this would be tremendous!  There are a variety of ways
that one can construct a purse to allow use of a purchased amount of
ecash(tm)  without being a customer of a particular bank -  a nifty
idea if the credit card part works.

The "credit card thing" has been much discussed but really hinges on
 a change in the MC or VISA rules that either doesn't allow someone
to cancel the transaction at a later date leaving the acceptor
holding the bag, or allowing the acceptor to charge a fee that
covers the default risk of the former.  Currently according to my 
reading both are precluded.

Curiously, a little bird told me that the VISA _cash_ cards for
Atlanta allow you to call up to order one paying with a credit card,
and that it appears on one's statement as merchandise.  I would be
curious to hear what VISA rule changed to allow a non-face-to-face
cash advance to occur and call it merchandise!  Whatever.

Best,

FOT

My own ideas, not my employer's.
