An interesting point. You are probably right that journalism is becoming
more florid as "amateurs" flood the market. However, I don't quite buy the
concentration argument, as things were pretty concentrated in the Hearst
era, and the explosion of magazines in the past few decades has not been as
concentrated. (In any case, these are hard things to quantify without more
research, which I for one am unlikely to pursue.)

I still think of "The Wall Street Journal" and "The Economist," two of my
favorites, as being _careful_ in their reporting (careful is different from
unbiased). But my main focus in this thread was on the _styles_, and this I
think is more explained by faddishness.

And advertising. To get "mind space," as with "shelf space," the packaging
must entice, fool, and trick the reader.

Yes, and many of the newsletters we're seeing--as many are cc:ed or
forwarded to our list--are the kissing cousins of "zines." Same faux style,
same emphasis on "flash" over substance. (Not all of them of course.)
