  Our database was obtained from American Business Information.
They make those CDROMs with 11 million business names and addresses,
and other such products.  There is a link to their web page from our
US download page.

  Our verification software does not check that the person whose name
is entered in the form lives at the address entered in the form.
We do verify some parts of the information entered.  Things like
is the state code one of the 50 states, does the zip code match
the state, etc.  (NOTE - these may not be the exact checks implemented
currently.  I have not examined the code myself, but these are the
types of checks being done.)

  We also screen out based on domain names.

  We will be increasing capacity soon.  The demand is very high.  It
costs
us real dollars to buy hardware and T3 lines to allow people to download
the software for free.

  I'm sorry that my choice of words disturbed you.  I hope my
explanation
will allay at least some of your fears.  There are many people here
(including Jim Barksdale) who are very concerned about maintaining
personal privacy.  Certainly if we could we would make the US versions
of our software available in the same way that we currently make
the export versions available.  At least people now have the choice
of obtaining the US version over the internet.
