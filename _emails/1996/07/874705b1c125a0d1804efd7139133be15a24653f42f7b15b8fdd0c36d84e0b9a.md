If encryption is regulated and outlawed, then Joe Sixpack won't have access to
any none Government Approved encryption algorithms.  I may still have access
to strong crypto, but if it isn't widespread, I won't be able to use it very
effectively.  As to your question about whether random data would be outlawed,
it certainly wouldn't surprise me.  Of course, one could always apply for
permission to transmit random data that is not used to transmit encrypted
information from the government.
