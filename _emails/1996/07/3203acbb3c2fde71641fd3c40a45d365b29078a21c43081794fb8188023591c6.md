No. Robber 18 knows that he will be killed under those circumstances, so he
proposes that Robber 20 gets all the money. 20 votes with him. Now iterate
backwards. If, under my assumption the proposers are selected by lot at
each stage, then 18 still knows he'd be killed, but not knowing which of 19
or 20 is the next proposer, suggests 19 and 20 split 50-50. Since each
knows that he might be #20 and get nothing on the next round, they accept.
Now iterate that one backwards.
