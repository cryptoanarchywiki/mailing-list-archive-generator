It seems to me that the computing age is advancing too quickly.  I bought an 
excellent Pentium 75Mhz system about one and a half years ago.  Now, I can buy a laptop 
of the same setup for the same price.  I do computer programming and just bought a copy 
of Borland C++ 5.0 for $300.  I expect it to be out-dated very quickly.  I dodn't bother 
with Windows '95, because it is way too buggy and Windows '97 is soon to come.  '95 was 
simply an introduction to what Microshaft can already do.  I don't fall for the daily 
updates, or bug changes, because I know that none of my internet software or printer 
software will run on it.  I wouldn't mind, however, making a program for '95 that would 
make me a few buck$.  I have observed that in the time that the P6 came out, Motorola 
(if that's how you spell it) has signed with another company to make a Gigabyte RAM 
chip.  Won't that be interesting?
