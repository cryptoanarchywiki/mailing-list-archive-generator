This, and similar remarks by others, consistently misses the point which I
have been making for about a year now, and which Director Freeh finally
made explicit in his testimony last week. That is--the government is
concerned with mass market software incorporating robust crypto, used
overseas, and recognizes that they can't keep niche products off the
market, nor stop bad guys from using crypto the government would just as
soon they didn't. Since the US has a hammerlock on that mass market, and
since few would switch products to let the crypto tail wag the features dog
(no slur intended), ITAR follows.

Though I've no connection with Freeh, it's interesting that his language is
almost word for word the same as what I've been using. Do you suppose some
of his staff reads my stuff?

Until now we haven't seen such an open public admission of what the
government is concerned about--probably because the State Department
doesn't like to have an official spokesman admit we're mass monitoring and
seining foreign traffic since it is an embarassment to the polite fiction
of diplomatic relations (though I'm sure the truth is that every country
with the capability does it).

What he's saying is that US-exported copies of the Lotus Lockshens,
Microsoft Machayas, and Netscape Niguns of the world still do not contain
robust crypto the USG cannot read.

He says it can, and suggests following the banking trail among other
things. We know the government has already had good success with this
strategy. And one of the objectives is to identify sponsors of terrorism
and retaliate against them (cf. Netanyahu).

Exactly.

So as Netanyahu says at length we need to build in protections against
abuses, using both the legislature and the judiciary.
