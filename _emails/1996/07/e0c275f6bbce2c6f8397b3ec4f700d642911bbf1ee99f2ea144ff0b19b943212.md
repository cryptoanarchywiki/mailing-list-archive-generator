Well, I don't have to be subject to such childishness.

Reverse engineering code is like decompiling it.  Starting with the
compiled code, you can translate it backwards (to some degree) and
see how it works.  It's not as easy as taking a compiled program and
ending up with the original C code, but if it's worth enough to you
you -can- end up with the same information.
