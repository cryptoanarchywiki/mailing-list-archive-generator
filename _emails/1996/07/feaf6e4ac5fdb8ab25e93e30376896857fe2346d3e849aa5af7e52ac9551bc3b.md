The High Performance Computing newsletter (HPCWire) just ran this article.

Looks like Government Access to Export Keys (GAEK) or
         Government Access to Keys - Export (GAKE) or
just plain GAK, for simplicity's sake.

ObNetscape- I can run a web browser, like Netscape, over T1 link through 
firewall, but Netscape can't reverse DNS the address, so I can't get the 
more secure version; I can run Lynx from my account at the university, but
Netscape doesn't like lynx, so I am back to dial-up PPP, at 14.4 .... 
Frustrating... any news on funet, or other 'export' sites?

U.S. Government Unveils New Encryption Policy Recommendations        07.19.96

  Washington, DC -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore recently unveiled new
recommendations to relax encryption export restrictions. The recommendations
come with the caveat that restrictions will be eased only if the "keys" are
escrowed to permit U.S. government access.

  Under the proposed key escrow, government officials could gain access to
software keys with a court order, undergoing a process similar to that
required to obtain wire taps.

  "These recommendations will protect individuals' transactions and
communications on the Internet nationally and internationally while
maintaining U.S. security," Gore said.

  Under the plan discussed by Gore, no restrictions of any kind would be
imposed on encryption software for use within the United States. But software
programs could only be exported with key escrow features allowing the U.S.
government access to the keys. Private companies would be established to hold
software keys and government could gain access with a court order.

  The administration abandoned earlier proposals that would have required
the government hold copies of all keys. The new proposal would also give the
Commerce Department authority currently held by the State Department over
encryption export decisions.

  Software industry analysts estimate that current export restrictions will
cost U.S. companies up to $60 billion in lost sales over the next few years.
According to press reports from Reuters, Netscape has noted that it is
already losing tens of millions of dollars in overseas sales because of
encryption export limits. The limits also impact to some degree the growth of
Internet commerce.

   Whitehouse officials are reluctant to recognize the claims of the software
industry. "There are a lot of myths about the nature of the imminent
commercial threat," Gore said, adding that officials at some companies,
such as International Business Machines, are supportive of the
administration's approach.

  According to press reports, another White House official said other
countries would ban the import of U.S. software if controls on encryption
were eased. "They will put up import barriers," the official said, adding the
United States is trying to craft an international consensus on encryption
policy, including use of key escrow, under the auspices of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development. The talks are "very far down the
tracks," the White House official said.

  An administration cabinet committee is continuing to address details of the
proposal, and expects to send its recommendations to President Clinton by
early September. Administration officials continue to hold talks with
industry executives, civil liberties groups and others.
