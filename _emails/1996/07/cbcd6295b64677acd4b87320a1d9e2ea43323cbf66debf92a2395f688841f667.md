I assume that when you say that "it does", this means that I can access the
encrypted drive from Win95.  If so, can you tell me how.  I have a 50mb
partition that's encrypted and if I boot to DOS everything works perfectly,
but from Win95, the drive is always encrypted.  I've tried entering my
passphrase prior to Win95 loading... no effect.  If I try to enter my pp
from a DOS box, it says that the SECTSR isn't loaded, but MEM says that it
is.  Any thoughts?
