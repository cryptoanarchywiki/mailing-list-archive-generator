	What would be the problems in setting up a web site to make a
charge to a Credit Card/ATM card number and return Cash, like an ATM for
the net?
	I belive this would be a easy tool to promoat wider use of eCash.
Not everyone wants to go through setting up an account at Mark Twain or
whereever, just the advantages of a more cash like system.  With a few
sites like this around, and hopefully therefore more eCash in the wallets
of the public this could help to add to a critical mass to eCash and so on.
I don't think it would create the critical mass nessary for eCash's
success, but at least another log on the fire.
	anyway...
