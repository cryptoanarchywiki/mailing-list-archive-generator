"Colonel, the mission was accomplished. Apparently the sniper was firing
from the 34th floor, so we simply took out the building. There was minor
collateral damage, of course."

Such overreaction to terrorist events is often precisely what a terrorist
wants, as I've explained a couple of times.

Well, go back and look for it. The clear point of my post was that the U.S.
should not adopt police state measures so as to reduce terrorism.

As with "buying out" the coca crop in Peru, the poppy crop in Turkey, the
marijuana crop in the dozens of countries, etc., their motto is, obviously
enough, "we'll make more."

Again, the Sarin attack in Tokyo had nothing to do with former U.S.S.R. CBW
weapons. Chemical and biological agents are cheap to make, especially in
the quanties needed to kill only a few thousand people, and in the
non-battlefield delivery environment.

Then why do you float ideas such as buying out the Soviet arsenal if you
think it isn't possible?
