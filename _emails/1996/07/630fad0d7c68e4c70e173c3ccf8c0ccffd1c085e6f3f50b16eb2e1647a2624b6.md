personaly, being legally a minor child (but only for 10 more months), i've
never used programs like SurfWatch, and I don't really think i've been
completely deranged by it.

My parents don't know what I see on the net, and pretty much they don't
try to regulate it..  Yet i'm still normal, I make good grades (ok, decent
at best in some classes, but I do suffer from ADHD/Learning Disibilities),
and I'm not some complete pervert.  Sure, i've seen my share of porn, but
everybody's seen SOME porn... anybody that says they've never done
ANYTHING like that is either godly, or a complete social outcast who sits
around and, as my AP Bio teacher would have put it, comtemplates their
naval, all of the time.  It just doesn't happen.

The important part is that people be mature about it.
