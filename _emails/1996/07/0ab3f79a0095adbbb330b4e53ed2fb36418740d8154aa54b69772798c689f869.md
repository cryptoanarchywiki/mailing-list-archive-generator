Knowing KGB habits as pertaining to releasing information to the public,
I would expect 50% of the CDROM to be pure bullshit, 40% -- lies, and 
maybe 10% truth that was already publicly available.

It is like buying a CDROM about the history of the Net from Dr. Grubor.
Maybe it would be interesting and amusing, but not worth $120.

Would be nice if I was proven wrong though.
