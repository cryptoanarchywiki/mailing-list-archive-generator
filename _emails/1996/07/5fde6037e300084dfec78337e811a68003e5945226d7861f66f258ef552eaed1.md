  I can't find anything in the S/MIME spec that makes the combination
of 512-bit RSA key and 128-bit RC2 (or 3DES) illegal.  The spec says
that you must support RSA key sizes from 512 to 1024.  Am I missing
something?

  How did you get the certificate of the recipient?  I assume that you
got it from a degenerate PKCS#7 Signed-Data message as recommended by
the s/mime spec.  That degenerate message could contain the attribute
I describe.  If you got the certificate by some other means, we would
fall back to your heuristic.

  Certainly.  We will definitely offer 3DES as well as RC2 in our
product.
