The tax wasn't charged by FT but by the government (ok, FT is
government-owned but it makes a difference nevertheless). Yes there have
been a few cases of censorship by the government (not FT!). As fas as I
remember the reasons were like chat services that allowed online
prostitutes or drugs dealers.

Prohibition of encryption is definitely a problem here. Although it's not
officially prohibited, you have to request a permit to use strong crypto,
and you don't get one if you plan to use "too strong" crypto like RSA and
you're not a "serious" institution like a bank. Some recent changes in the
organization of the security agency in charge of delivering permits as well
as the current trends towards the deregulation of crypto export in the US
may bring some change... some day. (see http://www.cnam.fr/Network/Crypto/
-- in french -- for details of french encryption regulations)

As far as I know, most videotex systems use 1200 bps and crude 8-color
graphics. That's ok to make use of many web sites, but the web seems to be
heading full speed towards higher and higher bandwidth and interactivity.
