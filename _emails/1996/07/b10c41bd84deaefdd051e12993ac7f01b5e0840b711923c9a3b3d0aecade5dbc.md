Yeah, you know, I bet your body doesn't get infected for lack of
penicillin, either. I suspect that taking Penicillin prepares you for
drug dependancies. Why, next, you might take insulin to deal with
diabetes, or worse!

Thank god most of those heroin addicts never had Ritalin as kids -- you
never know how much worse off they might be now. And if they'd gotten
antibiotics, why, forget it.

Quit from modern medicine cold turkey. Its the only way.
