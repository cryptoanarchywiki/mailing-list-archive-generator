In the aftermath(?) of the Ritalin thread, let us remember
the Two Commandments of the late (recently) Timothy Leary:

(approximately)

1# Thou shalt not alter thy fellow man's conciousness with
   drugs against his will.

2# Thou shalt not prevent thy fellow man from altering his
   conciousness with drugs at his will.

Thinking of T. Leary in memoriam I looked around for the
present psychedelic scene. Alta Vista sent me to where
'everything' seems to connect ... Santa Cruz, Ca.
