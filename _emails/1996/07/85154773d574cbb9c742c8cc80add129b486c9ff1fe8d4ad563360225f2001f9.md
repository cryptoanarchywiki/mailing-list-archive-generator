I don't think asking for this evidence is a good idea. After all, there
probably _are_ such examples. It stands to reason.

But so what? The issue is not whether extensive wiretapping would catch
certain conspirators and head off certain crimes, the issue is one of how
liberal and free societies are to operate. Our system has frowned upon such
Orwellian schemes as mandating that video cameras be placed in all
residences and in all hotel rooms, regardless of whether certain crimes
would be detected or deterred.

The proper argument is not to demand proof of how useful such measures as
the FBI would like to see are, but, rather, to focus on basic rights
issues.
