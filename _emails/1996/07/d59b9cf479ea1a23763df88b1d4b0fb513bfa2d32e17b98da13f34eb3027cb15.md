Further, I know someone who saw internal NSA memoranda from their legal
folks that court challenges of the ITARs should be avoided if at all
possible, as the ITARs would likely be overturned on constitutional
grounds.

(Not all of them, presumably. Shipment of hardware ("arms") would likely
not be affected. But the ITARs that stop the spread of knowledge, published
papers, and speech (such as speaking where a foreigner can hear!) would
likely be overturned.)
