The July 24 1996 edition of the Wall Street Journal has a front page article
about the "cashless Pachinko cards" in Japan which resulted in losses for
several businesses.  This was discussed in cypherpunks when the story 
originally broke months ago.  The article in the WSJ relates how the cards
were the results of fears that the money laundered from the pachinko halls
was being sent to North Korea to fund the nuclear program there.  The CIA
provided intelligence about this to the Japanese authorities according to
the article.  Far too many details to summarize here, I suggest those who
are interested read it.
