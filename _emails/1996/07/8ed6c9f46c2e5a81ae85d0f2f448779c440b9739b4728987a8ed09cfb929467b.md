Yeah, it's slimy.  If somebody wanted to be rude to you personally,
they could have sent you flames telling you to go away; 
if they wanted to be rude to you publicly, they could have imitated 
many others (:-), and if they simply wanted you to not exist they 
could have installed procmail or used a killfile-capable mailer like
Pegasus or Commercial Eudora and defined you out of existence.  

If the listbot sends you their name, you could always, umm,
escrow them or something.....

(In a killfile, no one can hear you flame...)


(I have tried to remove people from the list, if they've
sent it mail asking to "Unsuscrive" or whatever, but at least
for the last long while that's failed; you at least need a 
half-way attempt at forgery.)
