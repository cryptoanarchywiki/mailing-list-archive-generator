     While IANAL, and I don't know for sure about "Tim's Legal Advice", 
there is NOLO press, I don't think they are lawyers. I don't understand 
why you couldn't print "Tim's Earthquake Saftey Advice" as long as the 
advice wasn't totally erroneous. As to the last, you most certainly _can_ 
publish "Tim's Health Advise, or Tim's Homeopathic Newsletter and give 
essentially medical advise. 

     The non-crypto snake oil business is a big as ever in the US.
