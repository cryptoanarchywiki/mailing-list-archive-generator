Then the list of symptoms given was incorrect.  The list I got was from
_Living with Fear_ by Isaac M. Marks, M.D.

That still doesn't mean it isn't a disorder.  People with ADD _want_ to get
better and be able to concentrate more.  Drugs such as ritalin help them do
just this.  Dyslexia is also something that is a normal variation.  Somehow,
since it isn't psychologically related, no one would object if a drug was
discovered that could cure it and was administered to children with dyslexia.
Many people with ADD do not want to act the way they do, so it doesn't make
sense to not treat it as a disorder.

Who decides which mental illnesses or disorder are legitimate?  I think both
school phobia and ADD are disorders that can be treated if the person with
the disorder is willing to be treated.  You are, of course, free to believe
that these disorders are illegitimate, but the millions of people afflicted
with these would tend to disagree.

People who use the term to describe people who are abnormal don't know that.
The word "sane" comes from the same root as "sanitary" which means clean or
disease-free.  Hence, insane means ill.  It is true that the legal term
"insane" is different from the scientific term "mentally ill", most people
use insane as a diminutive term for someone they believe to be abnormal.
