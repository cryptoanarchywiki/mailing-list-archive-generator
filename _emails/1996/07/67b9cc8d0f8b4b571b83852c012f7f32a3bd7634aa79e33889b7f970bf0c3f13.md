tosses his cookies:

If you edit the file, Netscape may no longer be able to read the file
correctly.  (Bookmarks are similar in this respect.  Netscape code is pretty
picky about things like line termination and the like.)

If you toss your cookies, Netscape will probibly bring you more cookies, but
they will be different cookies than the last batch.  

Beware of burned cookies, fortune cookies (espicially ones with "Good Times"
written on them), raisin cookies (especially if the raisins move), Brownies
under the age of consent, and the cookies from dusty vending machines
(Especially the hairy green ones).

>This may have been discussed before, but until now I never checked for cookies.

You might also read the cookie recipie at
http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html .  I hear it was
written by a disgruntled Mrs. Fields employee.

>Thanks for your consideration of this matter.

You are welcome.  Have a nice day.
