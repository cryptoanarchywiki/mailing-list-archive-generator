The joys of having mailing lists gatewayed to news, you find this stuff 
weeks late....  Sorry for the delay

DHP is an ISP.  We are small, but this is mostly because we have a small
dialin pool and are not trying to compete with all the local providers for
people who are "learning the 'net".  We are looking for people who are
interested in a second account for privacy, and are at least competent to
know what a "shell account" is.  If you would want some more info, feel
free to hit our web page (though it's partially out of date), or drop me
some email. 

As to "grubor's domain" I'll be more than happy to tell you that DHP.COM
is not his domain.  Refer to the Grubor faq for more information on the
number of Pittsburgh ISP's he's joined, etc...
