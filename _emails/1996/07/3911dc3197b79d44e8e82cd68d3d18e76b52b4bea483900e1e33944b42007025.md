Are you sure?  MD5 is a 128 bit hash, and the probability of collision with 
a specific random piece of data (of any length) should be 2^-128.  I could 
be wrong, but do you have any explanation of why you think the answer is 
2^-64.

MD4 is the fastest hash I am aware of.  However, there has been some 
successful attacks against two rounds of MD4.  Although this is not to 
suggest that MD4 is insecure, MD5 almost as fast (~1.3 times slower) and 
more secure.
