Without professional knowledge of firewalls, a simple and true
answer is obvious.  Of course they are penetrable; that's what
they are for.  They permit users to penetrate, while attempting
to keep out intruders.  If it were impossible to penetrate
firewalls, then they would pretty much be useless to those with
authorized access.  How could they get in themselves?

Maybe 'feasibility' is the question.  That answer would depend
on some variables on the intruder's end.  If permissions and
rights are allocated to regular users with authorization, then
an intruder with adequate resources, knowledge, time, etc.
should be able to get in.
