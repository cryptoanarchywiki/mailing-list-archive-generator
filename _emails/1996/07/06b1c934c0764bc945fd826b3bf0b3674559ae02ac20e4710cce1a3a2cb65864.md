A human-based surveillance state is very expensive, even by the standards
of modern America and its bloated government. The recent example of the
DDR's "Staasi" provides an example. Hard to hide the extent of the
surveillance when so many people are involved.

Better, think the Thought Police, to use technology to do the intercepts
and pre-screening of the take.

Also, the right technology (right for them, not us) makes widespread
tapping possible, where human-based systems are not. (As but one example,
hard to get human spies into companies on short notice to monitor a
target.) In short, technology-based surveillance is "scalable" in a way
that human-based surveillance is not.

Boycott "Big Brother Inside" software!
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
