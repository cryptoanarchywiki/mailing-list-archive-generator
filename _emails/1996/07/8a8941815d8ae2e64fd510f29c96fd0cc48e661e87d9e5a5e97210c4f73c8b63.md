True, crypto won't be widely used until it is marketed and sold.  Only the
4 horsemen will have it.

Terrorists with their government supporters will have the support and
training.  So will high level drug dealers and money launderers (mostly the
same people).  Child pornographers will learn quickly.  Militias already
have the infrastructure to teach military techniques and some of them know
about comsec.  Soon all of them will.  Face it, the 5 horsemen won't have a
problem.

The 4 horsemen are a red herring.  The issue is domestic surveillance.

The bottom line of the issue is: Do we get end-to-end secure telephones
before or after the telecom industry/taxpayers have to make the investment
to provide law enforcement with access to 1% of all the calls in the
country?
