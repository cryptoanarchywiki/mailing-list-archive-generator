Well, if you've got your sound card in your computer, if you download Speak
Freely (from http://www.fourmilab.ch) and simultaneously turn on LPC-10
compression along with simple compression, I've found my voice comes out
more like Robbie the Robot than John Deters.  It's an interesting feature of
the LPC-10 compression that as it removes redundancy from the transmission
that it removes the "human identity" from it as well.  There's got to be a
moral to that story somewhere (especially since the NSA developed the LPC-10
algorithm).
