The friendly Anarchist's Bookstore in San Francisco sells several books on
building bombs. No Internet connection required. I would like offer another
possible explanation for the increase in pipe bombings. The People are
getting frustrated and a pipe bomb can be very useful device releasing
one's frustration.

[No, I do not approve of pipe bombing civilians].

   Defeat the Demopublican Unity Party. Vote no on Clinton/Dole in November.
   Vote Harry Browne for President.
