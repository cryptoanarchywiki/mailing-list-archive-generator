Just a thought...

Evolution also works better with a rich, diverse gene pool. If we
define "failure"
by the narrow standards of today's needs, and allow those who fail to die,
we may be left with people completely unequipped to cope with the radically
changed environments that future generations might face. "The first ones now
may later be last, for the times, they are a-changing."

BTW, have you read "Watership Down" by (forgot the first name) Adams? It
illustrates what I am trying to say rather well.
