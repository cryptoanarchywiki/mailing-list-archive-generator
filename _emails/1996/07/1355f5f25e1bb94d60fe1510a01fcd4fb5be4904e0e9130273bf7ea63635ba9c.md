The Mac Crypto  / Internet commerce workshop,( gathering, conference) will
happen...YES (if more like machack than anything else.)

The dates will be Sept 5/6, Here in Cupertino, CA at Apple.

In addition I will also host the Aug (late) or Sept Cypher-punks meeting
one of those nights too.

My goals are:

1) to provide a vehicle to educate any and all Apple employees and
Developers who are responsible for apple's future on the internet about
what is going on in the Internet commerce world.

2) To provide a forum where developers can work together to create internet
commerce producs for the Macintosh platform.

I am responding to the copious  feedback that I have recieved from
developers  both at WWDC and MacHack, through the various mailing lists
that I run (Mac-crypto, net-thinkers etc) and through personal contacts.

>>>>>>>>  I am looking for folks to talk, papers etc.. <<<<<<<<<

The (real)  prelminary agenda goes something like:

(day one) Introductions and overviews:

1) Introduction to crypto technology, what is it who are the players.

2) Introduction to electronic commerce (Finacial cryptograpy), e-cash,
e-checks, digital bearer bonds, etc.

3) How to use this technology today,  where is the oppertunities.

4) What needs to be done on the Mac, oppertnunites.

(day two) Tech stuff.

1) Random number generation on the Mac, (the key to strong crypto)

2) Password management and the Mac (How to get something better than the
Powertalk keychain)

3) Optimizing crypto on the PPC.

4) How to write a OT network server that will give you the  performance
required for transacting business.


remember this is a totatly grass-roots thing, but we are gathering
momentum. Look at how effective Internet-config is on the Mac.  The
conference will materialize more in August,  consider this an official
anouncement.

So book your air tickets, while they are cheap.. (bring a parachute?)


be there, aloha!
