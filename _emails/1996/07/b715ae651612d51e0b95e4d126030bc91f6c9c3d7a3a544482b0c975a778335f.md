Here's a question I'd like somebody to ask Freeh:


"There are some people who believe the development of uncompromised good 
encryption and easy communication, represented by the Internet, will lead to

representative of government, first and foremost.  Your job and salary and 
pension may be on the line if these predictions are true.  To what extent is 
your position on key-escrow/GAK designed to resist or prevent such an 
eventuality?"
