>
>Abstract
>
>{par. 1} An essential requisite for commerce on the Internet
>is the existence of a reliable and secure system to handle
>payment for goods and services purchased. The basic
>technology for such systems is public key encryption.
>Professor Perritt explains how this technology can be used
>to create a variety of "payment infrastructures." Any
>payment system must meet certain requirements: merchants can
>depend on it to be paid; consumers have access to the means
>of payment through intermediaries like "certificate
>authorities;" these intermediaries understand their
>responsibilities and risks; and existing financial
>institutions understand their responsibilities in the world
>of non-paper-based financial instruments. Much of what is
>necessary can be accomplished within today's legal framework
>without need of new laws.
