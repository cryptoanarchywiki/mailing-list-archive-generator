I suggest that your comment about non-neighborhood IPS systems is
speculative and isn't based on reading the formal threat assessment
analysis.

You are entitled to your opinion but it's just that, not an analytic
argument. It also contains at least one false assumption: that if "their"
threat evaluation deems it important, they can afford to implement it. As
we know this is flat out false. Many aviation experts have said that we
could make airplanes a lot safer than they are now (for example), but
nobody could afford to fly them if we did.
