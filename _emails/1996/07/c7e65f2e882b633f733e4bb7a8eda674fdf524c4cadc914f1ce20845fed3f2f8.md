Hmmm.  A new meme, "key recovery" is lots better than "key escrow," but
I still wonder if I'm ever gonna see a journalist say, "'GAK,' or Govt.
Access to Keys for cryptography."

I'm left wondering about a few cooperation-with-the-corporation issues
here regarding the Brit.govt, but I suppose time will tell how much of
Orwell is coming true in his own homeland.

Largest corporation in the world, if I'm not mistaken.

[I can hear Gore/Gorelick now, "Well, as long as it goes to SOME big
government (with a road-to-serfdom track record in economic freedom)
it's OK by me!"]

I suppose we will hear after the election of the balance between the
interests of government and those of indIVIDUALS. I always see this
image of me, sitting on one end of a see-saw, with former congressman
Rostenkowski on the other end.
