	You have my sympathies. Either I got logged off the list accidentally
a bit back, or someone did this successfully to me. I didn't notice due to
being gone for a bit, but I finally did and got back onto the list. I'd meant
to email the list maintainer (Eric Hughes, as I recall), but haven't gotten
around to it - lack of time. Any signs of who did it from the message? I would
guess not.
