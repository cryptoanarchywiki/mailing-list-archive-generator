Not so fast, D'Artagnan. Let's deconstruct your statement that it's a scary
thing:

1. Is it scary to the people who buy and use it? Apparently not, since they
hae free choice.

2. Is your finding it scary relevant? Apparently not, since you don't have
to buy it and thus have free choice.

What's left except authoritarianism on your part?

David
