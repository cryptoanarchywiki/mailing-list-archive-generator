By "you," I have to presume you mean "me." No, I am not at likely to use
this weapon in a rage against a loved one. Trust me.

In any case, by far the most common weapon used for family killings is the
ordinary knife. Easily available, in multiple forms, it kills efficiently
(if not always quickly).

It may sound "stupid" to you...I suggest you read up on evolutionary game
theory. Sometimes one has no choice but to respond to an arms buildup.
Unilateral disarmament rarely works.

By the way, many burglars consciously and carefully choose to be unarmed,
as confrontation is _not_ what they want, and they know that possession of
a firearm during a robbery significantly worsens their situation if they
are apprehended.
