Small correction: oftentimes one is trying to figure out the 'secret' 
algorithm used by the program, and that can be done by analyzing the
assembler just as well. I did this a few times to break 'secret'
cryptosystems. 

Certain programs encrypt their executable code and decrypt it at runtime
to make reverse engineering more difficult.
