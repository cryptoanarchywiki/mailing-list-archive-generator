What's the difference?  All practical measure of value is in 
comparison to competing objects.  This _does_ mean that your
"approvalness" coefficient goes up and down as your situation
changes, but it doesn't mean that your rating becomes
meaningless.  Hm.  If it happened that a bunch of prolific
raters got busy, ratings across the board would go down.  (Seems
statistically unlikely, but still...)  Then when they went back
up there would be a "burst of activity" effect.  :-)


Possibly what I like most about ratings and micropayments is how
the quantify previously unquantified human behavior.  We've all
seen the "burst of activity" on a mailing list or at a party, or
on a stock market, right?  Well that is just people's ratings
all pushing each other up!

Which is where the small payments to ratings producers from
ratings consumers comes in.  Again this is just the
quantification of a phenomena that we all take for granted.
(Namely, that people who produce quality ratings are producing a
value and trading/contributing it to others.)


("'Just' the quantification", I said !!  That might seem like a
hilarious understatement someday.)
