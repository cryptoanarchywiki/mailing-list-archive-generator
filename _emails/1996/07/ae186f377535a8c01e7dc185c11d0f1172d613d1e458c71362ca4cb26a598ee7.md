Why post them?  Barnes and Noble bookstore will sell you good poison recipes
in book form.  (I found mine in the bargain section.)  You can also find
them in any good book on organic chemistry or in a bookstore that
specializes in mysteries.

Or you can just go to McDonalds and ask them what is in the hamburgers...
(Of course, they will not tell you that it is made with troll meat.)
