I have no way of knowing (and I doubt anybody knows and can also speak
publically about it), but my informed speculation would be that the FBI is
continuing its cooperation with the NSA (as noted by Ken Bass at last
week's SAFE forum) and is using COMINT processing gear and programs
developed at the Agency.

It has been widely reported, from Bamford on, that much of the Agency's
computer power is devoted to keyword analysis from audio intercepts. While
computer translation programs may not have progressed much beyond "The
vodka is strong, but the meat is rotten" stage, it is quite reasonable to
assume that computers can mark for later analysis vast amounts of audio
surveillance material, based on words said, voiceprints of known targets,
etc.

The trend of the next few decades is likely to be the turning of the
government's Big Ears and Big Eyes on its _real enemies_, namely, the
people.

Actually, I think Hoover could well imagine the capabilities. Minaret and
such programs were in place while he was alive, and his use of confidential
dossiers as an instrument of power predated the current use by the Clintons
by several decades.

Needless to say, key escrow is quite useful in compiling contact lists. A
virtual pen register, as it were.
