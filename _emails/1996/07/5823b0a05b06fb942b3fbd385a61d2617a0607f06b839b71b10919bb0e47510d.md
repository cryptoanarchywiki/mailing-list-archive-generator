Good point.  Another bad thing about keeping the passphrase on-line is
that I would have to trasport the passphrase on floppy if I required
portability.  Depending on how important my information may be, I
could possible be carrying my whole life on a floppy.  I see now that
it is better to just memorize a phrase.
