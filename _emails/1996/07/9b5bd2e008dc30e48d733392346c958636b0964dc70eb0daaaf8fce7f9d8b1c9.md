Several folks said, ad nauseum:
>Please don't respond to Steinlight's spam - thank you...
(ans serveral variants)

For a group who claims to defend the rights to speak and 
associate, etc, we seem to be wasting a lot of energy
lately telling each other who we should talk to and
associate with.  I figure I can decide for myself.
Repeating your advice won't sway me.  Probably won't
sway most of us.
