 I want to apologize to everyone for being gratuitously nasty
 here. It wasn't called for.

Thats funny. I thought you were being completely serious and I sent you this
file. You are exactly right. it is of GREAT use for doing wordlist crack
runs. Why dont ya check out some realllyyy secure systems and find out what
utils they use to test their own security. I ALWAYS use created segments of
this when trying to brute force my way into my OWN machine. It helps finding
bugs that overwrite the stack..etc. But... apology accepted. You may learn
from it.
