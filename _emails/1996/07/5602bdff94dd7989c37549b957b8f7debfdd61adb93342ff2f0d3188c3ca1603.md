If we choose a plaintext/ciphertext pair carefully, we can easily save
ourselves some work (50%) while still making the attack a credible
demonstration.  The idea is to use each trial encryption twice.
	In _Differential Cryptanalysis of the Data Encryption Standard_, Biham and
Shamir note the following, known as the complementation property of DES:

if T = DES(P, K) where T is ciphertext, P plaintext, and k key, then:
T' = DES(P', K') where T', P', and K' are the bitwise complement of the above.

Now the interesting part. If two pairs (P1,T1) and (P2,T2) are available with
P1 = P2' or T1 = T2', then an attacker can restrict his search to only the keys
with LSB = 0.  The attacker runs through the remaining 2^55 keys (with LSB = 0)
and tests the results against both T1 and T2'.  Since testing for equality is
much faster than performing the actual encryption, time savings is on the order
of 50%.

Just a thought on how to save some cycles.
