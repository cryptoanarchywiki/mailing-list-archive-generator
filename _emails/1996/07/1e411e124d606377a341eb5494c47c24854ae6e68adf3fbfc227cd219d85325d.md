Sorry if this has been discussed before (please point me in the right
direction if that is the case), but VSNL, my government-owned ISP (which
also has a monopoly on all international traffic) made me sign that I will
not use my Internet connection for voice traffic. Is there any way they
could find out if I were using PGPfone, or rather, could I prevent them from
finding out?

The protestors of Tiananmen Square will be back. Next time, 
the battle will be fought in cyberspace, where the students 
have the more powerful tanks...
