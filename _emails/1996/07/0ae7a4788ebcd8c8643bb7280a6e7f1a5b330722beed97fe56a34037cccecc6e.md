I agree.  Editing is problematic.

It would be difficult to decode intentionally
hidden information.  The user may suspect strange and not
obvious stuff in a site's given cookie.  Then what may
happen is the user will "vote with their mouse" and stop
using a site that encripts cookie data (or perhaps not).

In any case the user will at least have the knowledge
that the cookie exists.  Those that do not encrypt may
provide other interesting information.
