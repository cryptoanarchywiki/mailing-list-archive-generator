It is about to be fought. I've got my money not on the government but on
Verisign, which has been issuing site certificates for some time now, and
just started issuing personal certificates which will permit message
encryption using certified, Netscape-generated public keys, among other
things. I think they and the free market will win, over the government,
hands down.

In that context (and in that context only), a lot of the heat from  PGP
fans against heirarchical certification is counter-productive to the above
battle, in that it diffuses the crispness with which successful secure (BBN
boxes, etc.) trusted heirarchical certification authorities will become the
de facto standard and freeze the government out (absent some new draconian
laws).

Verisign and RSA have already made the investment and the mechanism is now
in place and working automatically (except for the higher assurance
certification for which you need to appear before a notary if you're not in
a corporate heirarchy). They've cleverly automated a validation of
moderate-assurance certificate applicants' claims by automatically hitting
the Equifax data base, and the low-assurance (persona) certification is
automated so you need to "just ask". This won't cover everyone, but will
cover so many as to make little difference to widespread acceptance.

Depends on the organizations. Big corporations (which carry considerable
influence) aren't going to violate local laws. Thus we may see a "have" and
"have not" escrow-less crypto world outside the US rather than the
hoped-for-nirvana, depending on local laws and individuals' willingness to
violate them.

That is exactly what the NRC report recommended and why I opposed it so
vigorously despite its other good features.

We don't have to strong-arm anyone. Harbingers in the UK, the European
Parliament (or is it the Council?), the Netherlands, and the existing
situation in France provide little reason for optimism.

Remains to be seen. Netscape has a version they did for the government
which uses Tessera PCMCIA cards. If some big corporation adopts it, others
will follow. Don't count your chickens, etc.

They don't have to do any of the above. All they have to do is legitimately
contract for their own needs. This will get the costs down (by paying off
the costs of entry/capital costs) so that civilian offerings from the same
technology base could be quite price-attractive. The use of government
market purchasing power to influence events is now very well understood--we
(and Arthur D. Little) first studied it in connection with stimulating
energy conserving buildings back in 1970 when I was in the Department of
Commerce.

You will find it instructive to check out the Verisign web site, download
the public beta 5 of Netscape 3.0, generate some keys and get some
certificates, and in two or three months check out the promised Netscape
4.0 beta which will have e-mail encryption.
