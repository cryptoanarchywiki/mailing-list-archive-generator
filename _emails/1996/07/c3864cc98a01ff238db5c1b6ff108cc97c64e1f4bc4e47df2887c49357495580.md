Uhh, "fail to save" isn't a moral judgement; it's an observable 
phenomenon.  Either somebody does save money or they don't.  I
don't see in Tim's wording any judgement being made.  It's a 
numerical thing.

If you replace "drink too much," with "drink enough that they", you
get another observable phenomenon.
