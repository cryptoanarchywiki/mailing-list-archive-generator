Now try decrypting the file, or signing another file.  I have a 486-66 which
is now considered hopelessly sluggish by today's standards.  It takes about
5 seconds, while doing the same operation with a 512-bit key takes less than a
second.  I sign every one of my messages, so such a time delay gets quite
annoying.  I do have a 2048-bit key and encourage people to encrypt messages
with it, but I won't be signing messages with that key anytime soon unless
there is a much faster mpilib for PGP.

Other than that, I do completely agree with what you have written.
