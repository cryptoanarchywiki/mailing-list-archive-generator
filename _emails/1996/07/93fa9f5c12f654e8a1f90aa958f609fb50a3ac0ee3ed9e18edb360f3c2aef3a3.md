For clarification, the problem is often stated in textbooks similar like this:

You ask someone to write one number each on ten pieces of paper without you
being able to see the numbers. The person may use any number from 1 to
10^99, but may not use a number twice. The person turns over the ten
papers.

You goal is to determine the paper with the highest number [rules apply as
described in the original post]

The general solution is to flip over 1/e papers and choose the paper that
has a higher number on it than any of the 1/e papers turned over at first.
