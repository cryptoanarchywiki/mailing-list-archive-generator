What does "sin" have to do with the number 7? Oh, you must mean the movie
"Se7en," in which the Se7en deadly sins were central to the plot. I get it.
The seven deadly sins are the seven deadly hurts.

(Cos I know about sin.)

Ironic that the original message was from Jerome Tan, eh? Someone must've
trigged this whole thread. I fear we're going in circles.
