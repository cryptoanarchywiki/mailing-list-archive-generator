Perhaps this has already been voiced on the main list (I get a filtered
helping or two of cypherpunks), but *I'm* surprised that such a generic name
as 'Ecash' was granted trademark status anywhere.

It's like giving Microsoft a trademark on the term 'Email'...  It's nuts!
Was the term ecash not in use before DigiCash showed up on the scene?
