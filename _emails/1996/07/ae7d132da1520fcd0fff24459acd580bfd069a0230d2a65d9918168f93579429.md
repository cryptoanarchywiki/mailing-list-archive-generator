At this point, someone will probably claim that the export of a mere 
signature (or the XOR between a sig'd and a non-sig'd file) is, itself, 
prohibited from export under ITAR.  However,  I've pointed out in the past 
that even if that export is illegal, it could be done by an unknown 
"volunteer", possibly using means as innocuous as a paper envelope (with no 
return address?) mailed to a confederate outside the US.  Later, it could be 
mailed back to the (foreign) company who wanted it in the first place.

The foreign company would, of course, NOT be guilty of any export violation, 
because it had no part in the export, and it would just be a beneficiary of 
some (guilty) anonymous prankster's action.  This tactic would not benefit a 
domestic, US manufacturer of crypto software, because it still would have to 
export thousands or even million of copies of that software.

Also, another question occurred to me, today:  Let's suppose a piece of 
software was written which is designed to run on a Microsoft API, IF SIGNED. 
 If it isn't signed, it won't do anything.  Does that mean that it's legal 
to export, since it can't actually do any encryption?  If so, we may have 
the last laugh yet.
