Assuming "perfect" intelligence on the part of the robbers (i.e. they will
follow deterministic behavior and do the "right" thing), then here's what
must happen IMO (1 being the first guy and 20 being the last):

1 must propose that 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 all split
the money evenly. All of these will vote for it, assuming they're all
perfectly smart and deduce the inevitable outcome.

I arrived at this working backward from the case where two robbers are left.

If 2 are left (19 & 20), 19 gets all the money. So 20 will vote for whatever
18 says, which MUST include 20 in the deal. Since 19 knows this, 19
will vote for whatever 17 says, which must include 19 in the deal, and so
forth. Eventually you arrive at the conclusion that 1,3,5...,19 must
all agree to split the money at the beginning.
