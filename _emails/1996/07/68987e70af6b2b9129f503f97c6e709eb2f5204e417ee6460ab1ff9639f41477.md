Yes, my answer was quick, flip, and partly wrong.  It turns out the answer is probably indeterminate, because the amount people want to live is indeterminate.  Consider:


If two were left, #2 would get everything by the rules.  (he would propose, "I get everything!"  The vote would be 1-1, or 50%, which would win.)

If three were left, #2 knows that if #3 is eliminated, he would win as above.  #1 knows this as well, and is motivated to make a deal with #3 to prevent this.  #3 is also motivated to deal, because if he can't get an agreement he's not only out of the money, he's dead.  How they choose to split up the money is unknowable, I suspect, because of the "death" aspect.  #3 could also deal with #2 if #1's terms were onerous.  This problem would be simpler to analyze (and probably determinate) if anyone whose proposal was rejected was simply out of the game, rather than dead.


There's another complicating aspect. Voting order is important.  According to the rules, #3 must make a proposal, which needs to be voted on.  Obviously, #3 will vote for it.  But even if he's come to some agreement with #2, will #2 vote yes?  If #2 votes no, 3's gone and #2 wins everything.   So #3 couldn't trust #2 to vote yes. particularly if #2 voted last.  If #1 voted last, and #2 defected, #1 might vote for it, _IF_ it was more desireable than "zero" for him.

Could #3 make a proposal like this:  "I propose that the money be split up among all who vote for this proposal."   #1 would have to vote for it, else he'd get nothing.
