In our school library, there is a depository area wherein you deposit your things and get the tag. Since the library doesn't allow those tags to be brought out from the library, everytime you brought it out and pass by the door, it will alarm. Does anyone know what stuff is that? How come it is alarmed? I brought some metals but it wouldn't alarm... Why those tag would alarm them???
