This sounds a lot like security through obscurity... What happens when 
someone reverse-engineers the software and sees that it's carefully 
skipping over blocks?

If you don't want people to know about your encrypted data, use stego. 
Even if They find the stego software, you can always produce the keys to
unlock the duress data from two or three .gif files, and say "that's all
there is." 

Use stego to hide data. Use encrypted filesystems for convenience. If you
try to put the two together, you'll probably end up with feature-bloat.


The idea of an encrypted filesystems being accessable over the internet 
sounds interesting, though. Sort of a cross between NFS and CFS. Would be 
great for backup purposes.
