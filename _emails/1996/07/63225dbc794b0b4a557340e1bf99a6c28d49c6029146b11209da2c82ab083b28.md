I disagree.  The CDA is not likely to ever get enforced.  Does this 
mean that we should just ignore it because likeliness is zero to 
none?

Uhh, if the DA has a personal vendetta against the guy w/ the bike he 
*COULD* charge him, if he wanted to, and it would be 100% legal.  
What we are talking about here are laws that allow for harrassment 
under the guise of the legal system.  Granted, laws are not 
necedssarily bad, people are, but still....

This stuff CAN and DOES (there goes the "likeliness" theory) happen 
all the time.

Your point of view strikes as one from a text book where people are 
not crooked (nothing wrong w/ that), but the sad fact is that there 
are people out there who can and will take advantage of any legal 
loophole in order to get done what they want done.
