If I am reading the procmail docs correctly, then the following recipe
should create a lockfile called 'emscrypt.lock' which will prevent more than
one instance of the script from being run at a time

I agree it would be better if emscrypt used its own locks on the timestamp
files.  However, it is my understanding (someone please correct me if I am
wrong) that there is no simple way to provide file locking in Perl that is
portable across the various flavours of Unix (see the descriptions of the
fcntl and flock functions on p. 144-145 of the Camel book).  So I haven't
tried to implement locking from within emscrypt yet.  Of course, if these
functions are available on the majority of machines (anyone?) then I should
probably use them.

Yeah, I though about that too.  It can be somewhat alleviated by
batching the individually signed scripts into a single mail message, if 
you know you are going to be submitting several scripts close together 
in time.

Any other ideas?
