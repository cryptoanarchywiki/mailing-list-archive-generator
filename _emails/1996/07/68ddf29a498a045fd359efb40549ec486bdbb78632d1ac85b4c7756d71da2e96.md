So far, I've been sending them my offer for
        SPAM PREVENTION CONSULTING!
at my usual rates of $250/hour, minimum 2 hours, plus
any legal and collection fees required.  One of them
has a human reading the responses (the CHAG folks),
who's not highly impressed (:-), while the folks with the
hundreds-of-thousands-of-spam-victims-email-addresses lists
have only robo-replied, though they've both sent a second
set of spam and are thus billable :-) 

I assume, since the robo-spammers are posting from a new email 
address this time, that either their previous ISPs have dumped them, 
or perhaps that they're using the same ISP and multiple domain names
to hide it, probably the former.  CHAG is more blockable, since they're
trying to portray an image of stability and trustworthiness,
as opposed to hit-and-run.  Meanwhile, large numbers of replies
can always get their attention; I haven't tried forging the
address of the robo-spammers' robo-reply-bot on a message to them
to see if it knows not to spam itself, but if a thousand people
were to do it, they might start to think it was a movement or something.....
