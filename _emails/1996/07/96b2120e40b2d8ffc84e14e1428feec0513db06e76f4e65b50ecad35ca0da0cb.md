Word-List Builder  (this is not an ad)

I have a small(5k) program(WordList.EXE) that will extract <words> from any
file and append the new words to a textfile(MainList.TXT).  It is in early
beta, but does the job nicely.  I simply drag-n-drop multiple files onto the
icon and let it do its dirty work.  It prints new words to the screen and
echos "." when it encounters old words again.  It will, of course, accept
parameters from DOS.

This is totally free to anyone who wants it.  Just email and I will send the
latest version.  Suggestions are certainly considered.

Imagine building a word-list just from your /Netscape/Cache subdirectory!

Future versions will include:
     Larger multiple file handling, *.* in same directory support, better
binary file support, and list sorting.
