C'punks,

The Sunday San Francisco Examiner had an article about how simple
it is to make a pipe bomb.  It was syndicated from the Dallas
Morning News.  In the article a "federal bomb expert" opined:

	They're probably one of the more common explosive
	devices that are encountered.  That's because the
	pipe not only provides a container, but fragments
	into sharapnel."                        ^^^^^^^^^
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now I don't know what takes to qualify one as a "bomb expert,"
but the standards must be pretty low.  The reason hand grenades
look like pineapples is because it's very difficult to get metal
to fragment unless it is scored or otherwise predisposed to come
apart in little pieces.  What I've been told is that a pipe bomb
just peals open at it's weakest place and otherwise stays in one
piece.  Don't know, but that's what I've heard.  Makes sense to
me.

To put the fear of god in the readers the article dutifully 
chants the following mantra:

	Detailed instructions for making pipe bombs and
	other explosive devices are available for sources
	as varied as anti-government publications [what
	about GOVERNMENT publications?], pamphlets sold
	at gun shows and the Internet.

Are we surprised?


 S a n d y

P.S.	On an odder note, the same paper had an article 
	entitled, "Two-headed baby born in Tijuana." 
	The article reported, "...the child (sic) had
	been born with two spinal columns and two heads"
	One of the more bizarre statements was, "It's
	not clear whether un-named girl--or girls--are
	Siamese twins."
