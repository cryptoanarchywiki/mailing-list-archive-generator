What is more, in my case, it doesn't matter.  My feelings on the subject of
strong crypto are well known and almost always expressed over my .sig file
(which gives my address and telephone number).  In fact, I just asked to
have my name added to a letter addressed to FBI Director Louis Freeh on the
subject*.  If they don't know where I stand, then they don't care (as seems
likely).

The United States of America has a very strong statement in the first
amendment allowing people freedom of speech and "to petition the Government
for a redress of grievances."  While exercise of these rights has sometimes
resulted in certain sanctions (the Hollywood witch hunts and loss of
security clearances come to mind), if people don't stand up for what they
believe, then they diminish the very foundations of the country.  Sometimes
freedom is only available to the brave.  (But I don't really think this is
one of those times.)
