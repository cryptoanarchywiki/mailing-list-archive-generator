It sounds to me like the mom is abusing the drug -- Ritalin is tricky
stuff and you can really mess up a kid by overdosing.  That's child
abuse, IMHO, not some benigh paddling.

Alex, our 8 year old son, uses Ritalin. He doesn't need Ritalin to
concentrate. He can get caught up in a building project for hours and
create a masterpiece. He can focus so thoroughly you can't pry him
loose.

What Alex *can't* do is get comfortably through a day of grammar
school. I sympathise -- I was the same way when I was that age. I had
a tough time and I saw Alex having problems similar to mine.  So I
sic'ed the educational establishment on the problem. Alex ended up
with a Ritalin prescription. At least for now. And it's been pretty
effective. With Ritalin he finds it much easier to concentrate on
drivel, an important skill to make it through school, or sports.

The problem is that Ritalin isn't some useful, generically wholesome
substance like milk or peanut butter -- you risk more than "acting
out" if you're not incredibly careful. Sleep disorders at least.  But
I don't like the downside of doing nothing, so we're trying it out.

I've *never* seen Alex zoned out on Ritalin.

Rick.
