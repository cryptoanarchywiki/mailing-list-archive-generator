Jerome has so far asked us, among other things:

What does 'reverse engineering' mean in a hacking context?
Does anyone know how to make a home-made telephone voice changer?
Is it possible to penetrate a firewall?
How can I crack unix password files?
Is there a way I can run Unix under Win95?

I think this man needs to read alt.2600, not cypherpunks.

I wonder if this is the same Jerome Tan who was at Nanyang
Technological University in Singapore?

I wonder what the folks at St Luke's Medical Center in Manilla think of
this stuff?
