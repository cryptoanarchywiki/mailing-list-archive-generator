I hear this as the server sends out a key which the client uses to encrypt
the username/password.  This algorithm makes less sense than the one I
thought I heard at the SAFE forum on Monday which was:

(1) The server sends out a challenge/salt (different each time)
(2) The client uses a secure hash to compute hash(salt||password) and
returns the username and the hash.
(3) The server computes hash(salt||password) and compares the hashes.

Given that there is still some interest in algorithms and protocols on this
list, can you describe what is really happening?

Thanks - Bill
