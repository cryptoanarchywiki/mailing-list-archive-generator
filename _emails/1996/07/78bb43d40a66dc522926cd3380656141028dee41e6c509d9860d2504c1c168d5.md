Tim asked for a translation.  I thought it was one of John's more
declarative summaries.  It this case, it's reality that's skewed.  Voila:

The Central Intelligence Agency told the Japanese government that Pachinko
parlors (many run by ethnic Koreans) were sending hard currency to North
Korea which was assisting it in building a plant to produce fissionable
materials.  The Japanese decided to strong arm Pachinko parlors into using
magnetic cards instead of cash to discourage money laundering.

During the Kobe earthquake recovery, a number of Pachinko machines were
stolen, reverse engineered, and fake cards produced.  They were then cashed
in -- causing massive losses to the issuers.  The encryption technology was
very weak.  Mondex watch out that the same thing doesn't happen to you.
