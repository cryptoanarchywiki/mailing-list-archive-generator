Not knowing enough of the posting of John Deters, I can't tell where he is
being facetious, where I agree with him, and where I really disagree with
him.

So, take my comments as responding directly to what I perceive his points
to actually be:

As I see it, the more "educated" a subgroup becomes, in terms of
"education" about "the dominant political power structure," the more they
see the world in dark terms, and resent it.

The more "educated" an ethnic subgroup is about "racism" is, the more
racist they themselves are. (I learned this in 1970 when I went away to
college in California and found an entire racial/ethnic subgroup totally
consumed by fears of persecution and racism, so much so that they could
only study their own persecution and so screwed themselves out of any
reasonable chance of succeeding in the American culture.)

By the way, the accepted name for this is: "victimology."

I certainly agree with this. Many people and subgroups are losing sight of
this basic point. (Of course, their confusion is partially explained by the
fact that they have grown up believing that government schools are
responsible for instilling proper ethical values.)

And those who think the government school system _is_ responsible for
teaching moral and ethical values should ponder the issue of just what
moral and ethical values were taught by the official schools of Alabama and
Mississippi in the 1920s, 30s, 40s, and 50s. Duh. When you dance with the
Devil, you dance to his tune.

I'm 44 and I see just the opposite. Today's kids spout platitudes about
"Why can't we all just get along?" without any clues about what they mean.
99% of kids interviewed cite "racism" as the world's Number One problem,
showing their education to be a complet failure.

Well, on these points I agree. Non-U.S. countries often cluck about
America's well-publicized race problems, but we are far more integrated and
mixed than are most countries (and I lived for a year in Europe and have
visited a few times since).

One of my "meta-points" is to try to move the discussion beyond comments
about "hatred and prejudice," which I find to be code words for meaningless
chatter which misses the real issues. (No offense to John Deters is
intended.)

Thanks for the comments, John. My main point was that we should not give up
basic American (and "western") values for the sake of reducing terrorism.
(Ironically, one of the basic notions of terrorism of certain sorts is that
the very acts of terrorism will bring on some state which will further the
causes of the terrorists...the Hegelian triatica and all that revolutionary
stuff, etc.)

The terrorists should not be given a victory of sorts by implementing
martial law to reduce further attacks.
