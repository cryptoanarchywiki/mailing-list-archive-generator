I'm now watching the LP convention on C-SPAN, and taping it for a friend
(who may have a book contract to do a book related to something along these
lines).

The one LP event I ever attended was the California LP annual convention,
some years ago, and found it crushingly boring. This looks a bit more
exciting.

I suspect the LP will continue to get 3-4% of the vote, maybe a tad more
this year due to widespread dissatisfaction with Dinton and Clole and with
the obvious charisma of Harry Browne.
