Rather than using a central registry, this could be accomplished by using
plan files, mailbots, or, for people who don't have Unix shell access, dynamic
web pages.  This would make the remailer network much more robust should the
central registry be down.  I think that running ephemeral remailers would be
very useful if remailer software was configured to use them properly.  Also,
this would be useful for people who may have Unix shell access, but are not
allowed to run remailer software.
