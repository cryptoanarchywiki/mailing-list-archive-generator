The first cypherpunk should propose a 10-way split:  #s 11-20.  It's the
best offer #s 10-18 will be assured of getting without having to kill
anyone.  Once any one dies, I think the results will always boil down to #19
getting 100% of the money (when #s 1-18 are dead, #19 proposes that #19 gets
100% of the money and his vote is 50%, so he "wins".  #20 kills him out of
spite and takes it all anyway, though.  No honor amongst thieves.)
