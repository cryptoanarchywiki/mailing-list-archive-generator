I love telling Netscape to inform me before it accepts cookies.  It's fun
seeing who asks and whether they'll let you in The WSJ site won't let you in
if you don't accept 2 cookies from it.  It looks like they are an encrypted
version of your username and password.

Maybe Netscape could add a protocol which would let your instance of
Netscape tell the server that you are on a diet and the Doctor told you not
to accept any cookies.
