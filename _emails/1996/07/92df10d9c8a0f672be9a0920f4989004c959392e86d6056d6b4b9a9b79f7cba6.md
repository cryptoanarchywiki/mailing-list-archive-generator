I said counter-intuitive to the way we stereotype them. We stereotype the
phone companies as greedily pursuing metered rates and distance-sensitive
ones at that. Every so often we see a horror story that they're about to
charge per packet, or put in a modem tax, or some such. History supports
such fears.

I don't have the data to know if that's generally true, but I'll take your
word for it for the moment. Can you post or e-mail me something definitive?

Count on it. But I speculate the demise of smaller ISP's will come at least
in part in another way--the capital base of the big telcos means that they
can offer more reliable service, fewer busy signals, better customer
service, and more rapid introduction of advanced technologies AT SCALE as
they grow. But isn't that the way markets are supposed to work?
