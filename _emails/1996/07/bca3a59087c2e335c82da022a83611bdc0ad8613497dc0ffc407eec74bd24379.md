As I recall the NRC members in DC said, in *EXPLICITLY* rejecting
the "If only you know what we know..." mantra, that if there was
something the [NRC] did not know, it wasn't cuz that had not asked
everyone involved. (Or words to that effect)

So it appears the Admin was withholding data from the Congress....

	I have here in front of me, documented proof that there
	are crypto-carrying members of the Cypherpunk Party...
