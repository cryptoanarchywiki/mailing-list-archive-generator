Morning all, I'm only on the second cup.......

- From what I gather, is someone took PGP and ... say Private
Idaho ( examples only, please ) and put then in a cute box with
the instructions printed out and sold it in a store, the
government couldn't control it ? So, why doesn't someone round
up a couple of nice shareware front ends , and the rest of ot,
put it in an envelope and sell it for $5.00 US. The buyer would
then have to pay the shareware fee, and the balance after the
packaging could go into escrow for the legal defense fund of
Cypherpunks or to Phil ?

Another note on GAK

One morning King Arthur and his knights set forth on a quest.
Lancelot, feeling poorly, was left behind. Arthur stopped to see
Lancelot on his way out and entrusted him with the key to
Gwenevere's (sp) chastity belt. ( Lancelot being a true and
faithful knight )  As the band made it's way about a mile from
the castle, a knight happened to see a rider from the castle,
riding for all he was worth. Tha king called a halt to wait for
the rider. It was Lancelot... breathlessly he said to the king,
sire, thou has given me the wrong key.....
