You can find voicw changers and a lot of other fun toys in the Edge Company
catalog (+1 800 732 9976). They have other electronics, guns, knives, swords,
cross-bows, what have you. No homicidal maniac should be without their
catalog.

It would be an interesting EE project to implement a voice changer in software
using a PC with a sound / phone board.
