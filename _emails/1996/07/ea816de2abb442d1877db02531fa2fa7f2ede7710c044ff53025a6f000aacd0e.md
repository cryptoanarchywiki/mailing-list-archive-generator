Personally, I think it was a good idea for the American Colonists
to shoot at the British from behind rocks and trees.  As Tom
pointed out in his post, there are relatively few Cypherpunks.
We all do what we can, in whatever way best suits are temprament,
talents and acceptible risk level.  There is no single tao; there 
are many paths.  For Netscape, dialog and negotiations may be the 
best way to promote privacy, for Zimmermann, it was guerilla 
programming, for others it might be high-tech monkey-wrenching.  
To each his own.  As far as I can see, they are all trying to 
bring strong crypto to everyone.


 S a n d y

P.S.	I want to make it clear that I have the greatest
	respect for Tom and Netscape's contributions in
	support of strong crypto.
