>From LI Newsday today, p. 18:

  Suit Follows Muder by the Book
  Publisher of how-to 'Hit Man' manual is blamed in 3 killings

  The Associated Press

  (Greebvelt, Md.) - James E. Perry committed muder by the book.
  Now the book's publisher is accused of aiding and abetting his crimes.
      In a case that legal scholars say could set a precedent in First 
  Amendment law if allowed to proceed, a federal judge yesterday said 
  he would rule in 30 days on a motion against the publisher of "Hit 
  Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors".
  [..]
      The $10, 130-page book has sold 13,000 copies since it was 
  published in 1983 by Paladin Press of Boulder, Colo., a small company 
  that sells mostly through mail orders from its catalog.
  [..]

No mention of the Internet or four-horseman in the article.
