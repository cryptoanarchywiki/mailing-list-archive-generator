Off Our Backs is a PC lesbian magazine.  "On Our Backs" is an S&M Lesbian
magazine edited by Suzie Bright.  It is not anything resembling PC.  (Ms.
Bright does not have a nice oppinion of Dwarkin and her fellow travelers, to
put it mildly.)

ObOff-Topic: If you ever get the chance to hear Suzie Bright speak on one of
her tours, by all means go.  It is well worth the time!
