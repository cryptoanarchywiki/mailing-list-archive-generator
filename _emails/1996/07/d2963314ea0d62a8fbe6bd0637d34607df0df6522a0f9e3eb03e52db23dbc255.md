I'm running one of the panels at this conference, and it's exactly these
issues that I, too, was wondering about.  I've got the head of INFOSEC for
FEMA and a National Planning Associate for the American Redcross on the
panel with me. These are the guys who DO the stuff you're talking about -
making sure that we can survive a hurricane, etc., with the minimal
damage.  In working with them on the INFOWAR issues, I don't think that
anyone's going to be really pleased with what they have to say.  Expecting
FEMA to be covering national INFOSEC disasters would be logical, but I
don't know if anyone mentioned it to _them_. 

And, if you think the DoD *ISN'T* involved in emergency management, you're
wrong.  I was very surprised, when working with the American Redcross
National HQ on this conference, how much classified information the
Redcross handles, and how tightly integrated they are with DoD 'liason'
offices.  And if Dole wins (God forbid), just wait and see what happens.
