Microsoft and GE, the parent corporation of NBC, are participants in the
FBI's "Web Awareness Program." Like the FBI's "Library Awareness Program,"
which tracked which books were being checked out by which patrons, the Web
Awareness Program tracks user interests at Web sites.

The WAP has already allowed the FBI and other intelligence agencies to
check up on several people who appeared to have an unusual interest in the
TWA 800 case.
