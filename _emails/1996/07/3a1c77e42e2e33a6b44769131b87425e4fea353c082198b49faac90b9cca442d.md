There are three issues with MD4/5 relevant to rsync
1) Collision probability - if you're concerned that a damaged packet
will have the same hash as the original correct packet, that's 2^-128.
If you're concerned that you may find a damaged packet with the same
hash as _some_ correct packet out there, that's a birthday problem,
and approaches 2^-64 if you've really got lots of packets that you
can keep track of at once, but in reality the probability is much lower
since you won't be keeping 2^64 packets around to collide with.

2) Deliberate collisions, and 3) speed - If I understand the description
of rsync, it needs a checksum to detect packets with different values
so it can determine whether to send an update packet.  It's concerned with
people changing _data_ in non-malicious ways that you want to detect,
so the security issues about MD4 and MD5 aren't relevant, though 
systematic changes to data resonating with the hash function are.
You can use _much_ simpler hash functions than MD5 - go check out a book
on error correcting codes and related math.  Most error detection 
applications these days use 32-bit polynomials, since they're good detectors
and can be implemented very efficiently on 32-bit hardware.  They're
useless for security, since you can invert them, but that's irrelevant.
If that's not reliable enough for you (and it may not be), 
there are polymomials in lengths like 64 bits or 128 bits that should
have good change detection, not be too sensitive to patterns in data, 
and be _far_ faster than MD4 or MD5.  

If I remember right, rsync was looking at using 16- and 32-bit checksums
to get a quick probable result and MD4 as a backup; you can save yourself
work by just calculating the 128-bit function and using the first 32 bits
as a quick check.  If you're _sure_ you're not worried about birthday
problems in your collisions, a 64-bit checksum is fine,
and will be even faster.
