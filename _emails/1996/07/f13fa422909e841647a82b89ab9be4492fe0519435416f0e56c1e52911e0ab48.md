Well, in Switzerland all telephon-switches (including the ones the company I
work with manufactures) record:
1. start of call
2. destination of call
3. source of call
4. end of call

After all, you can get a detailed list of all your calls by the end of the
month (the phonenumbers of the destination are somewhat obscured -> only the
first 4 digits).

So, hellcome to the new age of transparent customers!

As soon as you get digital switches (POTS or ISDN) your phonelife is
measured, stored and statistically evaluated.
