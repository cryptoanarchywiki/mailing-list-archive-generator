Clearly UnProfessor failed to read recent Phil Karn's testimony
at the Senate Subcommittee.

Phil, representing both himself *and Qualcomm* explained how
Qualcomm had attempted to export a Triple DES application to
their own Hong Kong office, *for use by the AMCIT employees there*
to communicate with Califunny.

The request was denied with a FORM LETTER checked "resubmit a
non-Triple DES method" or words close to that.

Further, Phil told the Subcommittee that every time they need a
bug fix on the CDMA code running on the system in HK; they must
resubmit the whole package back for approval. A BUG FIX! They've
been through this many times, each one taking eons.

Just suppose ARCO needed all new permits every time they adjusted
the crude mix, or retuned the cat cracker?
