You are quite right.  I was mixing my criticisms.  My mistake.

A message pool provides only recipient anonymity, of course.  For sender
anonymity (e.g. posting to a message pool), chaining is the right way to go.

Good points, all of them.

I agree that public message pools seem to give far better security than
reply-block approaches.  (Although the two can be combined: set up a nym
reply-block which just redirects traffic to alt.anonymous.messages; then
the reply-block is not security-critical, but does allow folks to contact
you by a simple email address.)



Jim Bell brought up the really nifty point that someday soon we may be
able to receive these message pools by satellite dish-- hurray for true
broadcasting!  That would provide most excellent security (unless `they'
started requiring licenses, waiting periods, ... to own a dish-- unlikely).
I can't wait.



Another suggestion was to read alt.anonymous.messages by pointing the
anonymizer at it.  This doesn't stand up to my threat model at all.
The anonymizer only provides you anonymity against a malicious server
who is trying to collect marketing information-- it doesn't protect
you against SIGINT folks eavesdropping on network links, performing
traffic analysis, etc. to trace back your access.

Now if we had pipe-net deployed :-), the idea might work...
