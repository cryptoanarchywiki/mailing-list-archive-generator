Then I also suggest that you install a metal door and put metal cages on
your windows.  That will at least give you some time to wake up if
someone tries to break into your house. Also get a good dog.

Without that, having a gun will not do you much good. It will be more
trouble than itis worth because you cannot understand the situation
quickly enough after you wake up, so you may kill someone peaceful who
entered your home with good intentions, which will get you in jail.  If
you had a metal door, you would have enough time to wake up and assess
the situation.

One-sided approaches to security rarely are successful.
