If there is anything that is clear about GAK, it is a system which is NOT 
intended to benefit all citizens approximately equally.  The vast majority 
(over 99.99%) of the population will never be the victim of any sort of 
terrorism.  If anything, it's intended to provide job security for 
government employees who are increasingly aware that the unhappy villagers 
will be showing up at the castle with their torches.

The best thing the government could do to prevent terrorism is to simply 
stop misbehaving; to stop doing those things that make many ordinary 
citizens feel that they are far more a victim of their government that any 
terrorist or criminal.
