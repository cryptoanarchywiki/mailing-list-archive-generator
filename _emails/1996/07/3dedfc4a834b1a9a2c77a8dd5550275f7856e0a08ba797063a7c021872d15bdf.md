I am writing an historical piece on crypt(3) optimisation and password
guessing heuristics. This naturally enough envolves tracking down and
analysing various code/papers that have been seen as significant and/or
infulential in those areas.

In the late 80's Matt Bishop while at NASA, wrote DESZIP, which for a
while was the seminal work. Matt has pointed me to a US summer 1987
article which describes some of the DES optimisations, however as I am
an Australian national, Matt can not legally send me the actual
implimentation to me due to idiotic ITAR restrictions.

If someone not as constrained could address the problem described, I
should be delighted.

"Of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely  exercised for the good of its victims  
 may be the most  oppressive.  It may be better to live under  robber barons  
 than  under  omnipotent  moral busybodies,  The robber baron's  cruelty may  
 sometimes sleep,  his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who  
 torment us for own good  will torment us  without end,  for they do so with 
 the approval of their own conscience."    -   C.S. Lewis, _God in the Dock_
