Agreed. And if a remailer chain is long enough, the "someone can tell if
you send mail to anonymous mailers" is meaningless.

(In an ideally crypto-anarchic world, millions of messages are being sent
to anonymous remailers, and it is worth nothing to know that Subject A sent
a message to an anonymous remailer.)
