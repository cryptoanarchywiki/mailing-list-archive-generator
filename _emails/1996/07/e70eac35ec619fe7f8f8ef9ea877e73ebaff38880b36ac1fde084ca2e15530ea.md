Well, I will admit the first one was satire, but the last two
were perfectly accurate.  For the humor impaired, this is an
example of AOL.  (That's Acronym OverLoad, not to be confused
with the popular online service.)

You see, Gregory, there are far more things in the universe than
there are three letter abbreviations for them.  Hence, as the
number of acronyms increases, collisions are inevitable. Asking
"What is GAK?" or "What is ATM?" is really not well-defined
outside of a narrow discipline.

As is evident.

"TRS" is also an excellent line of precision torque sensors,
should you be in the market for one.

Har!  If you want "mean-spirited fun", drop into rec.pets.cats
sometimes.  Methinks you live a sheltered life.
