This isn't the same panel I saw mentioned on this list.  That one had,
as I recall, two individuals being selected by each of several cabinet 
departments and executive agencies.

Big companies like IBM, AT&T, etc. have *international* networks.  Hence,
the connection to the crypto export policy, which prevents comprehensive
security programs from being deployed.  As a "senior techinical executive"
(oxymoron alert) to Fortune 50 companies, I assume you know that and are
simply choosing to ignore it for the sake of your current argument.

There is more to security than authentication, as I'm sure you also know
but are choosing to ignore.  Authentication alone may suffice in some
situations but clearly not all.  And in fact, this merely supports my
point: left to government's preference, we'll all be well-authenticated
when the surveillance tapes are introduced into evidence. (:-)

Indeed.  This isn't a different battle, though; it's all interwoven.
I don't want the government responsible for "securing the domestic
infrastructure..." for the same reason that I don't want them telling
me where or to whom I can sell crypto.  They haven't any right to, IMO,
and besides, I don't trust them to look out for my interests.
