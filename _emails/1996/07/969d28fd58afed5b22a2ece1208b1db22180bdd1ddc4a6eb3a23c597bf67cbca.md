There is a time and space dilation when the gun is pointed directly at you
and about to be fired.  (Been there, done that...)  Perception tends to be
skewed when all of the adrenaline is pumping into your bloodstream because
of a perceived impending death.

Believe me, it does look big.  A 12 gauge especially...  (Had a brother who
came close to shooting me because he thought I was a burglar.  Not fun.)
