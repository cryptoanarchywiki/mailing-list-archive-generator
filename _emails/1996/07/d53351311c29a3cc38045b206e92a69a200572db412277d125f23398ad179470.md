[From Phil Karn]


Netscape's use of a CGI interface to download the US version
(128-bit key) of Netscape Navigator raises the possibility
that they are "serializing" or "personalizing" each copy they
send out, perhaps in response to a DoS request that they do so
in order to trace unauthorized redistribution.

One way to test this theory without redistributing the actual
code is to compare MD5 hashes of the distributions. After two
days of unsuccessful attempts at obtaining the code from their
overloaded server, I've just successfully downloaded the SunOS,
BSDI and Windows 95 versions of Netscape Navigator. Here are the
MD5 hashes of the files I received:

BSDI version:
4ec4a705e2e4c6560475852fae807c8c

SunOS version:
e72ff352ca7c619cb31b8f8ef3651b28

Windows 95 version:
8e936813f12a1b3b77ed03d9239ebd5d

Anybody care to compare these to the copies they obtain, assuming
the logjam on the server breaks sometime soon?

Phil
