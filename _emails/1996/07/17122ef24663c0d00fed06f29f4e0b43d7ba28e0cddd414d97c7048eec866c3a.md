Is there a good hacker handbook, telling you how you can do things your
government won't let you, something along the lines of a modern-day Abbie
Hoffman "Steal This Book"?

Excellent project. One reason that e-mail is picking up in popularity is
that sending a fax to the office address is like sending a postcard.

Look around you: while "civilized", "white" and "man" might characterize the
vast (?) majority on this list, I'm sure that's not the universe on
cypherpunks. And how does it matter? I'm suggesting an e-mail course that
people may subscribe to if they wish. I'm currently attending a course on
Cyberspace-Law for Non-Lawyers, presented by the  Cyberspace Law Institute
and Counsel Connect with thousands of others
<http://www.counsel.com/cyberspace> -- I'm sure there are people from all
continents 
on that course, and the question of it being condescending hasn't arisen.

That's no good to the rest of the world. Forget them: the question is,  are
*you* in a position to share your knowledge?

>And if I were in a 'totalitarian' or restrictive country I'd be damn
suspicious,

Maybe lesson 1could be on how to use an encrypting anonymous remailer, and
those who succeed get lesson 2 onwards untraceably.  If they are suspicious,
they don't have to join or can unsubscribe.

We say *nothing* during the course about what we feel about the political
situation in Singapore, the work situation in multinationals or Bill
Clinton. We restrict the course to a sharing of knowledge on crypto in the
Internet spirit of a free economy.

I'm one. Be glad to tell you more,...

If they are, its only in pockets,  and they are doing an awful job of
telling people about it if none of us has heard. The Internet is still very
new here, most people don't know much about it except how to click the porn
bookmarks.

>Otherwise, if you don't

It's only crypto, not the Bible or Koran. And let them be their own judges?
You seem to want to protect people in the Third World the way the US
government wants to keep cyberporn from kids.

Thanks,  mate. What's the use of all the theory you develop and software
you'll write if it is inaccessible to those who need it most? Just think:
you work in a sensitive job, have a bad conscience about all the forests
that are being cut on account of collusion between the Forest Department and
the illegal loggers -- now you can maybe talk to someone about the weather
or the greatness of Kim Jong Il,  and in the process upload all you know
about the scandal, untraceable to you.

Did you let that stop you in the past? Suppose the course were conducted
from outside the US? The packages can in any case be downloaded legally from
outside. I'm sure there is no law against your telling me how to use a
particular software package? Anonymously, if you must?

What I have  in mind is as follows: 

"Building a Cryptobook" lists a number of software packages:

SecureDrive
PGP
Private Idaho
PGPfone
Wipe Utilities
S-Tools

Joel provides also the configuration steps needed to get it all working,
which is an excellent starting point. Suppose we do an e-mail course telling
people in simple language *why* they need this, what benefits they would get
as a result, how to download (idiot-proof instructions all through), and how
to set up *for basic, minimum security*. I'm sure the software packages will
have all sorts of bells and whistles that the novice doesn't need, not right
away. Maybe some or all of this instructional material is already available.
Could we pick up a set that is easy to understand and concise? That could be
packaged together as a course or a book, a sort-of "Crypto for Dummies."
Would people like to select individual software packages, and put the
material together? Everyone gets due credit, of course.

Think for a moment: Just as Nelson Mandela stood today at the corner of
Trafalgar Square in front of South Africa House, where I'm sure many of us
have shouted ,"Free Nelson Mandela!", some day soon we might get similar
thanks from some Chinese or heavens knows whom...

This, and the encrypted fax would help greatly. I'm sure others have good
ideas too. Please send them. How does one go about facilitiating their
implementation?
