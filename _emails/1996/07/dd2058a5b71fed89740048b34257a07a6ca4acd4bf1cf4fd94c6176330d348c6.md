Replying to our argument about securing access to one's house: I just
recioved a permission from Alan to post his message to Cypherpunks 
maillist. He just confirmed my point that sleeping with a gun under 
the pillow in an unsecured house is extremely dangerous:

Again, I am not crusading against guns and armed self-defense, but 
I am indeed saying that simply having a firearm at home does not insure
safety and security. You have to go beyind having a gun and get a dog
and/or a metal door. A good fence is also a plus, although may not 
always be possible.
