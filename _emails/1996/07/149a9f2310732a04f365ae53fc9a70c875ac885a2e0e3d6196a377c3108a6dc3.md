And why did the networks put Rush on so late? Could it be that
he did not pull in the viewers?

It is shallow logic, but it is Rush's own logic. He promotes the
idea that success is measured in ecconomic terms. The failure of his
TV show demonstrates the failure of his ideas under the criteria 
which he himself espouses.

That is not what the trial will decide. The question is who and what,
why is irrelevant given the nature of the offense.

Nope, I look to the millitas, Chritian Identity, the Klu Klux Klan 
and their appologists including Liddy and Limbaugh. If you read
the propaganda that the NAZIs used you will find it if anything 
less direct than Liddy or Buchannan. The NAZIs did not advertise their
intention to commit mass murder, they used code words. When Buchannan
refers to "Hose" he is using a codeword he knows will be understood.
