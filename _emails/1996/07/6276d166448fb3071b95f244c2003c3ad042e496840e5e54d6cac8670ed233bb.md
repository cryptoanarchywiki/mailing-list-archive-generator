  If we chose to "kiss ass", we would not be distributing software
that does strong encryption over the internet.  We would not be
selling millions of copies in thousands of retail outlets across the
country.  We would be doing what some other companies have been
doing for years, which is only produce export grade crypto, even
for US customers.

  The simple fact is that our executives decided not to provide
our US software for download over the internet until we got
a written statement from the Office of Defense Trade Controls
that we would not be prosecuted for such actions.  This decision
was made by our executives based on advice given them by lawyers
that they trust.  The requirements imposed by the government
were to get this written statement.
