You should do your homework. It's going to have a lot of industry people on
it and be chaired by an industry person.

You should do your homework. It has to do with being able to carry military
cargoes. Those features worked perfectly.

You should do your homework. There are many restrictions in this world;
business licenses, paying for services used, etc. My point was that there
are no laws prohibiting strong domestic crypto and you know that to be
true.

You are evading my point, which is that some protections are too expensive
for an individual firm to cost-justify but are justified in public benefits
from such protections. And there's no evidence that government regulations
have slowed down protections on domestic financial networks, domestic air
traffic control networks, etc.

I would not object if you were making valid points, but you're not. You're
evading the basic argument and trying to respond by nit-picking.

Again, you haven't done your homework. Ask any serious company what they'd
like to be able to do, and what they can afford (cost-justify) doing. I can
tell you from direct personal experience (I've been a senior technical
executive of two Fortune 50 companies) that you are flat wrong. Don't take
my word for it--ask the security chief of any Fortune 50 company.

Some companies used to have an aphorism "If you haven't had at least one
security violation, you're spending too much money on security." I don't
agree, but it reflects what companies used to think they could afford
unaided. Yet these days a "security violation" isn't just some safe left
unlocked in a guarded area but the West Coast power grid going down or a
747 being spoofed into a mountain.

"not so high" compared to what? what level of protection?
"costs of not doing so" doesn't capture public losses, which is the basis
for government intervention.You haven't done your homework. I suggest you
read any introductory economics text that covers public policy economics,
or any good cost/benefit analysis text.

Now THAT is apples and oranges. The security of, say, IBM's, or the FAA's,
or AT&T's domestic computer networks has little to do with crypto export
policy.

The subject matter of the Commission's inquiry has more to do with
authentication than message encryption, and more to do with infrastructure
and network security. And as it happens there is no problem getting export
licenses for authentication-only software with as secure a key as you like
and no escrow. RIPEM/SIG did it years ago. You aren't even on the same page
as this issue.

Again, you are trying to fight a different battle in the wrong arena.
This isn't about your ability to encrypt your traffic. It's about securing
the domestic infrastructure against information warfare. I know this is
beginning to sound tiresome, but you'd better do your homework.
