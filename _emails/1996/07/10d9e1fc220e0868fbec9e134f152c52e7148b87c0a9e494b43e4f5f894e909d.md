It also would have little structural integrity - if you attached it to
trees, which sway in the wind, you'd have a broken fiber in a short time.
(The fiber doesn't even need to break, per se; microscopic cracking,
usually at the cladding, will ruin your fiber) (bird strikes would also be
a big problem, mostly for the bird)

Fiber optic cable usually has a kevlar sheath, and exterior aerial grade
fiber generally has a fiberglass rod inserted between the inner sheaths
and the exterior jacket. Water is also a factor - fiber buried in areas
where moisture is likely to be present (almost all applications) is
usually installed with a silicon gel between the interior jackets and the
exterior; water otherwise adheres to the exterior of the cladding, and
expands due to freezing. This causes fine fractures in the cladding, which
makes it more refractive - increasing chromatic dispersion, and therefore
a higher db loss on the cable. 

:)

ob crypto/privacy: Anybody have a good idea for detecting a tap on 
exterior fiber? I'd expect an attacker to have to interupt connectivity, 
terminate both ends of a break, and insert an active device. Thoughts?
