But they _are_ (so far as I know, though I haven't checked recently).

That is, there are export restrictions on computers and programs which can
perform certain mathematical operations faster than some specfied limit.
For example, FFTs faster than a certain rate.

My copy of Mathematica, updated less than 18 months ago, says "Not for
Export," and this was not because it contained any crypto code, but because
of the performance on certain algorithms (on commonly available machines).

COCOM-type restrictions were relaxed several years ago, of course.

And a lot of the old COCOM restrictions were not on export per se, but on
export to specific countries. Including by transshipment
("CPU-laundering").

Boycott "Big Brother Inside" software!
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
