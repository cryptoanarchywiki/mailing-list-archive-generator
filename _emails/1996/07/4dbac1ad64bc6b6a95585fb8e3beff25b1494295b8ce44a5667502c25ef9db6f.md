Ssshhh! Don't let it out that I'm crazy as a loon.

BTW, "loon" is now considered to be derogatory slur and has been replaced
by the more PC term "differently outlooked." We differently outlooked
persons are forbidden by U.S. and California law from owning firearms, a
method used increasingly to seize the firearms of those who have ever come
into contact with the mental health profession.

(Hint: Never, ever, ever, ever have yourself admitted to any kind of
psychiatric facility for any reason whatsoever! Never, ever, etc. let a
family member have you admitted for treatment, observation, or analysis.
You will likely find that your right to own a firearm has evaporated if you
do any of these things.)

Personally, whenever I fill out the forms to buy a gun, I have no
compunctions about lying. (The checking procedures are primitive,
fortunately, unless one is so stupid as to answer "Yes" to any of the
questions the form asks.) That I am a felon has never stopped me from
picking up a gun.
