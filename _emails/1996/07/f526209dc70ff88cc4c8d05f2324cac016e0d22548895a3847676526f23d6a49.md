Unless they start using prosecutions similar to what they pulled back during
the Meese years with video distributors.  I am waiting for them to start
using RICO laws on sites carrying Usenet groups deemed "obscene".  RICO has
already been used in some juristictions for shutting down video stores (and
maybe even bookstores).  It is not over yet...

The control freaks will not be happy until everything you view and see has
previously been approved by some board or ministry.  (Or they at least have
some way of hurting you if you step out of line.)  Whether that control
freak behaviour is driven by religion, morality, "your own good", greed,
power or lust does not matter.  the results are pretty much that same.

But there is a social stigma surrounding porn.  Most people who look at porn
are not willing to admit it in front of friends and family.  many of the
more vocal opponnents to porn are the ones most attracted to it.  Look at
jimmy Swagart.  He crusaded against it for years.  Never stopped "Lonesome
Cowboy Jim" (5 point if you can name that album and artist) from wanking off
to it...

Depends where you go.  Most of the Usenet stuff is crap, but that is true of
any medium.  (It is called a medium becuase it is rarely well done. (Stolen
line...  Forget the original author.))  There are exceptions.  Usenet will
give you smut that may (or is) illegal in your area.  Some of this sort of
stuff can be mail ordered, but there is more risk.  (Like postal service
stings/entrapment and the like.)

There is much better quality available on the pay sites, but since you
usually have to pay to view any of it, you never know what is available
until you have forked out a bit of cash.  (I am surprised I have not seen
more sites using e-cash for this purpose...  Porn drove the VCR industry for
many years.  I expect the same for the web and e-cash.)

>4) the web is changing from static to dynamic through Java and the like.

Most pay-for-porn sites are going for interactive video instead of java
and/or vrml.  (Yes, you can pay $$$ to duplicate the experience of a stroke
booth via the net.  All you lack is the resolution, the interaction, and the
requisite sleeze of the experience.  Dancers the size of postage stamps!  Wow!)

Might be interesting...  This is more evident in CD-ROMs though.

I think that was the cover of Spy magazine...

"Be a Great porn Actor at Home!"  Reenact bad plots, cheezy dialog, and bad
writing in the privacy of your living room!

Well, if it is something that will cause arousal in male humans (or computer
geeks), I am sure you can sell it.

Porn stories and/or hacked pictures of celebrities already occurs.  Has
since I have been on usenet...  (Many years now.)  One of my favorites
involves the Brady Bunch...  In fact there are celebrities who have hired
people to track down phoney pictures and get them pulled from web sites.

(I always expected something like this to show up on Star Trek:TNG.  Having
Beverly Crusher catching Weasly with the holodeck porn programs involving
all sorts of convelutions of the bridge crew.  He would probibly blame it on
Riker...)

Bandwidth is the only thing preventing the smut from getting farther than it
already has.  The easiest way to kill a web server is put porn on it and
advertise.  All of the schemes coming out for "cool gee-whiz web extensions"
take more bandwidth than most people have...  Just wait and see what happens
when cable modems become available.

Check out the alt.sex heirarchy.  Something there I am sure...
