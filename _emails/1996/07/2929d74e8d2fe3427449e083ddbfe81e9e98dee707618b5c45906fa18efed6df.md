> @ RISK
> 
> Two kinds of anonymous re-mailers have evolved to protect the
> privacy of users. The first, and the less secure, are two-way
> database re-mailers," which maintain a log linking anonymous
> identities to real user names. These services are more accurately
> called pseudonymous" re-mailers since they assign a new name and
> address to the sender (usually a series of numbers or characters)
> and are the most vulnerable to security breaches, since the logs can
> be subpoenaed or stolen. The most popular pseudonymous" re-mailer is
> a Finnish service at anon.penet.fi".
> 
> I believe that if you want protection against a governmental body,
> you would be foolish to use anon.penet.fi," said Jeffrey Schiller,
> manager of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer
> network and an expert on e-mail and network security. Last year, in
> fact, authorities raided anon.penet.fi to look for the identity of a
> Church of Scientology dissident who had posted secret church papers
> on the Internet using the supposedly private service. *8
> 
> The second kind of re-mailers are cypherpunk" services run by
> computer-savvy privacy advocates. Someone desiring anonymity detours
> the message through the re-mailer; a re-mailer program removes
> information identifying the return address, and sends it on its way.
> Schiller says that a cypherpunk re-mailer in its simplest form is a
> program run on incoming e-mail that looks for messages containing a
> request-re-mailing-to" header line. When the program sees such a
> line, it removes the information identifying the sender and remails"
> the message. *9 Some re-mailers replace the return address with
> something like nobody@nowhere.org."
> 
> Further protection can be obtained by using free, publicly available
> encryption programs such as Pretty Good Privacy and by chaining
> messages and re-mailers together. Sending the message from re-mailer
> to re-mailer using encryption at each hop builds up an onion skin
> arrangement of encrypted messages inside encrypted messages. Some
> re-mailers will vary the timing of the outgoing mail, sending the
> messages out in random sequence in order to thwart attempts to trace
> mail back by linking it to when it was sent.

> Linking encrypted messages together can be tricky and

> At the Harvard symposium, the pair provided additional allegations
