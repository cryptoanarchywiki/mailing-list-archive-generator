A simpler solution would be for the user to number each message. He would
send message #1, then message #2, then #3, etc... Skipping some numbers
should not be a problem. The server would just have to keep track of the
most recently recieved message number, and only accept messages with a
larger number. The user would also have to keep track... It would be very
easy to do; the user could number each message based on date and time.
