At a recent conference in downtown DC, I was chatting with a few folks
in the hotel bar. One of 'em was reminiscing about his days at the CIA
and I reminded him that during my presentation earlier that day I talked
about crypto-anarchy (giving appropriate credit to Tim May, of course).

I asked him if he had ever monitored the cypherpunks list. "No, I
didn't. It was too high-traffic," he said. "But the guy in the next
office over from me did."

Is this the first confirmed report of TLA cypherpunk-monitoring?
