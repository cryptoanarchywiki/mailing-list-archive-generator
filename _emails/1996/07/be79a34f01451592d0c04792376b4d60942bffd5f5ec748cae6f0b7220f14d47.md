The problem with banking applications is that cracking a real key
causes lots of real damage.  I don't think it is illegal (as long
as you don't withdraw somebody else's money), but publishing e.g.
one of the DES keys used for the "EC Card" PIN verification would
bring the European ATM system close to collapse.  Finding a self-
generated key, on the other hand, is not very impressive.
