I doubt we'll see many non-cyber-journalists saying "GAK", at least in print :-)
But the name "Clipper III" seems to be catching on fairly well,
which has the added benefit if connoting "yet another key-grabbing
attempt after the previous two failures", which I like a lot.

Key recovery is at least quasi-honest, unlike "key escrow";
I'd tend to call the Clintonista's scheme "key registration"
though I've generally found that "master key system" gets the point across
adequately.
