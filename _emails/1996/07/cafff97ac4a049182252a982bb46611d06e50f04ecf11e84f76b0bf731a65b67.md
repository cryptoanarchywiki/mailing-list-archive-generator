Well, from a users point of view, sending packet data over a packet mode
bearer service is more efficient (and cheaper). An interesting developement
in this direction is the PMBS-A/B modes of ISDN (packet switching to the
public switch). The existance of this service suggests its usability.

We have a well developed DQDB-MAN and ATM net around, and bandwidth is
available (and getting cheaper by the minute). Currently, a onetime
investment of around $2500 per client is necessary to provide >5MBit/s
transfer volume (via the cable TV networks or the existing broadband networks)

Not if you have a dedicated packet switching network for asynchronous packet
transfer only. If you use it for both you don't have to have a very fast
network, you have to have a network with predictable and constant packet
delay. (that's not the same as fast!)

I guess Internet-telephony is one of the bandwidth killers.

There are of course a lot of alternatives:
- Existing wiring (5 MBit/s over 6 copper wires is possible)
- Usage of the cable networks
- Radio transmissions (RITL - radio in the loop)
- Satellite transmissions

Neither am I, but isn't anyone?
