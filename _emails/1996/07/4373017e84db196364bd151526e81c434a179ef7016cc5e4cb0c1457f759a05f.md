Could you please quit spewing inaccurate information?

Dobbertin completely cracked MD4 already, and found MD5 collisions in
a document circulated on May 2nd that mean it isn't far behind.

The comments you are making are dangerous because they encourage
people who don't know better to think that hashes which are known
unsafe are safe. Please quit posting until you start monitoring the
field enough to have accurate sources of information.
