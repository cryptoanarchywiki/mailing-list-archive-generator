Interesting.  I think the most efficient way to search the keyspace would be
combine both methods of distributed cracking.  Each person would choose a
chunk of keyspace and brute-force all the keys within that space.  Then, the
user would send a PGP-signed message to some centralized database that says
what keyspace was brute-forced.  The UserID and fingerprint of each user would
be made available along with the keyspace each user claims to have searched.
This way, reputations could be used to establish which keyspaces should be
double-checked and which ones shouldn't.  This would allow for more "weighted"
probabalistic assignment.  The number of computons that would be used to crack
the keyspace would be somewhere in between centralized and probabalistic
assignment.
