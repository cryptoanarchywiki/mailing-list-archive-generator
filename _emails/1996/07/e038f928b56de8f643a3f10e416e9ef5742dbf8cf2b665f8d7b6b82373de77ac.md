alarmed? I brought some metals but it wouldn't alarm... Why those tag would

Most of these systems are made of an oszillator (basically a few windings of
a wire with a capacitor:

 ------
/      \
¦--¦¦--¦
\      /
 ------

This acts like an ordinary RLC-Oszillator. When you put it in a electrical
field with the right frequency, it will effect the field strong enough to be
detectable.

So, if you shield it, you win.
