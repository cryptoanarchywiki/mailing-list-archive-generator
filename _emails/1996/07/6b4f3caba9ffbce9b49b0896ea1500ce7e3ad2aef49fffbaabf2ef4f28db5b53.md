     For somone who is so afraid what people are doing with knowledge
found on the internet you seem to be doing a good job of using it
yourself. You are a hypocrit of the woorst kind. It is disgusting that you
would complain about other people and then use a remailer. And in case you
are unaware of netiquette one doesn't use all capital letters . That is
screaming . If we don't know who you are I doubt that we have done
anything to be screamed at by you. 
      If this list really bothers you then I think it would be better for
all if you left  it.If you reaaly want to contact a fed agency about
problems why don't you contact them about alt.bestality(I like animals). 
      In any case I think that we are monitored by the government anyway.
They have to do something to justify not being cut back
