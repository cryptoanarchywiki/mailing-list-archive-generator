Of course a real rating would be signed by my ratings private 
key and not by my e-mail private key.  I might start a service
where I will pay you for your ratings and then distribute them
for a fee.  (Note that you get paid for generating ratings, as
long as your ratings get good meta-ratings.  You have to pay to
use other people's ratings.  This is how it should be.)


Regards,

Bryce
