SternFUD calling someone a fascist is a prime example of a (crack)pot calling
the cattle black. The corresponding Russian idiom is

                      Whose cow should moo
                   (Ch'ya by korova mychala)

Please don't follow up on SternFUD's articles. Thank you.

Down with the Usenet Cabal! All power to the GruborBots!
