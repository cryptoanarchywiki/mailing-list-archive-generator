So have I, but your assertion begs the question.  In an unarmed
society, people don't have to curb their impulse to the extent
they do in an armed one.  As a result they often don't.  The
Swiss and the Israelis seem to avoid internecine fratricide, even
though guns are everywhere.  I don't think it is any coincidence
that incivility and casual violence have increased in America in
direct proportion to the ongoing orgy of victim disarmament.

I've noticed that most civil and human interactions occur in gun
stores and rifle ranges.  I've been treated shabbily in health
food stores, but never at a gun show.  When was the last time
you heard of someone being killed at the shooting range or in a
gun store?  It's statistically infinitesimal.  Now ask yourself
the same question about liquor and convenience stores...

Powerlessness is far more a cause of impulsive rages than the
trust, responsibility and empowerment engendered by gun ownership.
