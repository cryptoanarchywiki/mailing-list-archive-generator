Isn't it odd that when music is sold, CD's are MORE expensive than cassette 
tapes, even though you _know_ that the manufacturing cost of CD's is less?

Another oddity:  The price for a blank, standard-quality videocassette is 
about the same as that of a blank, standard-quality audio cassette tape, 
despite the fact that the volume of tape included in the former is probably 
about a factor of 10 higher.
