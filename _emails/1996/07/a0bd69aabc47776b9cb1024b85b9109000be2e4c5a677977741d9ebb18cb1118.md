If even that much.  Most of the "permission" i've heard of was infered at
best.  The NSA, nor anybody else, has the _legal_ power to stop you from
putting crypto on the Web, on FTP, or anywere else, so long as you do not
_willingly_ give it to foreign citizens.  If some non-citizen downloads it,
and said they were a US citizen, its not your fault. you THOUGHT you were
giving it to a citizen, which is all the law actually requires.  Of
course, if anybody like Netscape actually had the guts to take this to
court, arguing that ITAR doesn't cover Crypto, the ACLU and other such
would probably back them, and it'd stand a fair chance.  Unfortunatly,
everybody in a position to do this has decided they'd rather not risk
having presidence (sp?) that this _was_ covered under ITAR, of which there
is none.
