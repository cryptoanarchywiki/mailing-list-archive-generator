Do y¹all think there might be an interest in a
utility which would allow the user to deal with
browser cookies?

What I imagine is a little utility that would
display the cookies stashed on a machine and
give the user the option to either delete or
<snicker> edit </snicker> any given cookie.
(Hey, it¹s *your* computer, not the website¹s).

This little app would also come with help text
explaining what a cookie is (and is not).  In
future it might run in the background and alert
the user when a cookie is being dropped and the
user could give or deny permission (Netscape 3.0
will do this as well).

As it is an ³anti-virus² type product it would
be offered for free.  I could just stick it up
on Apple¹s (or Netscape's) website when finished.

Do any such utilities currently exits?

-Chris
