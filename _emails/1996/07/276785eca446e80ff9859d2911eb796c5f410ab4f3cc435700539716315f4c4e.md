As has been discussed in numberous previous threads on this topic, even a
passive rating system is very hard to implement. The computer doesn't know
if you hit delete because the post was garbage or because you are running
late on some project. An active rating system is virtually impossible to
implement, given the added workload on the readers.

Good lucky anyway,
