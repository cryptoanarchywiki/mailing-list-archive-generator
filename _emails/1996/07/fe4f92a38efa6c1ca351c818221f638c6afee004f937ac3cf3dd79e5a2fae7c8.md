     No, the POINT IS MIS-DIAGNOSIS. Children who are either brighter 
than their classmates and figured out the assignement with in minutes 
of the teacher giving it, or children with _no_ boundries implemented 
by their parents (people are like fractals, very subject to initial 
conditions) hence they keep pushing and pushing so the parents respond
by instituting chemical control.

     Most of the people who are arguing "against" ritilan ADMIT there 
are (or might be) some cases where certain chemicals are the way to go, 
but we feel that there are FAR to many cases out there.
