-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

	The PGP public keyserver at jpunix.com has developed a
stability problem over the past week or two that I can't seem to
account for. The keyserver stops in the middle of a run and leaves the
lock file so all incoming key requests get backed up until I notice it
and manually fix it. Having to continually monitor the keyserver has
become burdensome and is not doing anyone any good.

	I've always been happy to provide the keyserver as a public
service to the PGP users community but, the keyserver is not getting
any better no matter what I do to try and fix it. There are no errors
generated and no log entries to point me to what the problem is.

	With this in mind, I have decided to retire the keyserver at
jpunix.com effective 07/27/96 sometime in the AM Central Standard
Time. If you have any applications that point to this server, I would
ask that you point your application to one of the other servers or
make some arrangement to use a different server.

	It's been an honor and a pleasure to provide this service and
I apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause.
