	Basically, what you're saying is that one armed person in a crowd
of a hundred needs to be killed no matter what happens to the lives of the
other 99? Give me a break, we're not living in the 1800's anymore, we want
to STOP wars, not create them!

	You'll never see it happen. First of all, a lot of the chemical
weapons in the former Soviet Union are probably not even owned by the
government, some are probably owned by private individuals. Secondly, the
former Soviet Union would never give up all their chem. weapons for the
same reason, that the U.S.A would not give up theirs (they'd be left
defenseless, or very open).
