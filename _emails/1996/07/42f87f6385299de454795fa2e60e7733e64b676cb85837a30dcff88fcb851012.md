	The most dangerous person is the world is a an armed
	law enforcement officer.  The least dangerous person is 
	that same law enforcement officer, dead.   

	The _only_ difference between a gang of thugs, and a government,
	is that the latter admit to being thugs, whilst the former deny
	that.  They both operate on the same prinicple -- steal from
	others, and kill those that oppose them.

	Note in passing that the British Army is more than perfectly
	willing to massacre the civilian population, it purportedly 
	protects.   Of course, that is in their capacity as an 
	occupation force, as part of their pacification procedures.

	Thanks, but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather live
	in a country where everybody  << including six year olds >>
	carry, and can use Uzi's, etc, as a matter of course.  

	Where weapons are just another thing to carry around, and 
	used to kill those who don't respect human rights --- like the
	British and American governments, for starters.
