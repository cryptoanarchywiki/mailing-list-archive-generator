International agreement on this issue won't happen this century.
People don't understand the problem (or why it needs regulation),
are suspicious of the US and its motives -- in any case
international negotiations take forever. As for the "concession"
regarding liberalisation of export controls of crypto -- big
deal. The stuff is available anyway outside the US, so the only
people helped are US industry -- why should the rest of the world care? 

Without international agreement, the whole key escrow idea
doesn't have a leg to stand on, and I doubt US industry will be
willing to wait that long before  they can use strong crypto in
their international products.

have the more powerful tanks...
