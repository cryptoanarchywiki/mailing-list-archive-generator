If  you're a store and I want to buy something that costs, say, $4.50, and 
we want to eliminate the need for change (for whatever reason) then I would 
pay $4.00 up front and we'll flip the electronic coin for the rest.  At that 
point, you already have $4 so I'd have no reason to welsh on the remaining 
50 cents.

It obviously doesn't work this way if the minimum coin is larger than the 
current purchase...
