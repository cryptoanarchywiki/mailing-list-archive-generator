Don't rush to judge too quickly. Software patents (For the most part) are 
*not* really understood by the patent office. Why do you think Compton's 
slid one by on Multi-media ? Fortunately, there was so much fuss set up 
over that one, the office pulled it for review. 

All it takes is someone "skilled in the art" to backup your claim that 
method "A" is provably workable...
