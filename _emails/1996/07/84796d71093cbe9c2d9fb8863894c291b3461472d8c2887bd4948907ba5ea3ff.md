this SHOULD never happen, for the same reason that money cards (the one's
with the chip embedded in the plastic) should never happen.

I'll use the card as an example of why not...

ok, say I DID get a money card... here's the process that makes the
encryption, and/or any other security, useless.

1) get a bank loan, and transfer the $$ onto the card.. lets say
$100,000...

2) copy the chip.

3) now go cash both at seperate ATM machines, the same day.

4) pay off your loan. (you decided you didn't NEED a house after all)

5) move to switzerland, because this is VERY tracable.

you now have $100,000 CASH, and a small paper trail. No cryptanalisys
required.

Of course, this would require some equipment, but anybody who can afford
the equipment, with, say a small loan, can pay back their loan that day,
and still have a bit of spending cash.
