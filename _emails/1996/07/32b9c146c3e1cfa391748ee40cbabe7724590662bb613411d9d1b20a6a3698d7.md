ISPs have functioned better using flat monthly rates, and the biggies are like
AT&T are going in the same direction for internet access.  I don't 
see this as being 'counter-intuitive' at all.  The costs to the 
ISPs and telcos aren't really based on where you call or how long you 
are on anymore.

Big questions are how the main hubs for the internet are maintained 
(esp. when some of the big telcos maintain them... a conflict of 
interest, perhaps).  Will fees become too much that smaller ISPs are
put out of business, or that we'll start seeing ISPs merge?  (Remember
when there were mainly local cable companies?)
