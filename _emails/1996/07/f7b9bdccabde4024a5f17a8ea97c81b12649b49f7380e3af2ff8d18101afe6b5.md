Hmmmm. Got a call this morning from a Mike Hughes of the Amarillo PD (APD). Seems they've received "several" complaints about the anti-CDA image on my home page (http://www.shellback.com/p/merriman). Supposedly, it's not the nudity they complainer(s) is(are) all riled up about: it's the age of the models that's being questioned.

Hardcopy of said image has been forwarded to the FBI for 'review'.

Officer (sorry, don't recall his rank) Hughes says *he* thinks the models could conceivably be 18; a judge they showed it to said _she_ thought (personal opinion) younger. Hence, the forwarding to FBI for quasi-official determination.

Officer Hughes going to stop by so I can show him:
        A - that the page is PICS rated
        B - the original of the image :-)
        C - the precautions that PWS takes to warn folks about possibly offensive content.

I don't plan to change the image, so if anyone can point me in the general direction of some Legal Assistance (tm), I'd appreciate it.
