The Wicked Witch of the East wasn't "ready to accept" a house being dropped 
on her.  Denning's personal desires are equally irrelevant.

I consider the primary benefit of good encryption to be the "hindering the 
ability of law enforcement to perform" the particularly abusive "mission" 
they've chosen for themselves.

Many if not most of us out here believe that the ("probable cause") system 
is abusive, and has all the prospects of continuing to be abusive in the 
future.

But some of us consider such access to be unconstitutional, however "useful" 
you may believe it to be.  In the past, the government has had the extreme 
luxury of not being forced to convince the public of its "right" to wiretap. 
 Now, the advance of technology is forcing the question of such approval to 
be answered, and the Denning-types are getting really worried that the 
public isn't going to give that approval.  Tough!
