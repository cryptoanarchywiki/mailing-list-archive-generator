Yep.  Got it just after the announcement.  Came through fine.  (After that,
i could not get it to download anything, but the first try worked fine.)

Sounde like it is overloaded.  (Of course, since it is mentioned on their
homepage and they only have one machine serving it, what do you expect?)

Give it a week and i am sure that someone will have it available.  Something
announced this far and wide will manage to leak out somewhere...
