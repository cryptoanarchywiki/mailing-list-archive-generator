I'm assuming that the keys are, themselves, encrypted.

Easy solution!  Make 'em show up at the front door.  It'd cut down on the 
requests, I'd say...    This would be an excellent way of getting around the 
"response time" requirement:  The time the cops take to actually arrive and 
request the key is THEIR time, not that of the escrow agent.  Locate the 
escrow agent in Encampment, Wyoming, and see how many can find it!

However, this raises an interesting question:  Can key-escrow agents change 
the terms of their operation to delete such responses (or slow them...) for 
the cops?  Or, for that matter, can they charge the cops an arm and a leg 
for the key?  (Say, $100,000 per?)

Another question:  The cops probably assume that the escrow agent is NOT 
going to inform the key holder that the key has been delivered.  But if the 
stated policy of the escrow agent is that the key owner MUST be informed, 
what are the cops gonna do about it? 

Further, how are the cops going to evidence the existence of a valid 
warrant?  (As opposed to a forgery?)
