In danger of looking foolish? Man.. you said it all. Young child?? Hardly.
Nothing to back me up? Hardly a clue is what you have. 16 people so far asked
me for the program. Obviously they had a use for it. for SOMEEEE reason that
is beyond you to comprehend. If it doesnt work for you.. then it shoudlnt be
for ANYONE. Wow.. you sound like some of the politicians I get to see logs of
trying to regulate encryption..etc. I wonder if you are one of them!!
My..wouldnt that be a funny coincidence.
