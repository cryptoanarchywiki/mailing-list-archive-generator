MicroPatent, 4 July 96
 
 
Systems and methods for protecting software from 
unlicensed copying and use (Assignee -- Convex Computer 
Corporation) 
 
 
Abstract: Disclosed systems and methods for protecting a 
software program from unauthorized use and copying 
through the removal at least one of a plurality of 
instructions comprising a software program, and 
encrypting the removed instruction utilizing an 
encryption algorithm to produce an encrypted instruction, 
the encryption algorithm responsive to a randomly 
generated key. 
 
Ex Claim Text: A processing system for protecting a 
software program from unauthorized use, said software 
program including one or more unencrypted instructions 
stored in memory associated with said software program, 
said processing system comprising: a processing unit 
operable to: remove at least one selected said 
unencrypted instruction from an executable area in said 
memory associated with executable portions of said 
program; encrypt said at least one selected unencrypted 
instruction removed from said software program utilizing 
an encryption algorithm to produce an encrypted 
instruction; store said encrypted instruction within a 
first non-executable data area in said memory associated 
with said software program; and insert at least one 
trappable instruction in place of said encrypted 
instruction within said executable area in memory 
allowing said software program to be linked with one or 
more other programs.
