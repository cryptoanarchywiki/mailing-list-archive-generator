Yeah, this "two photo IDs" is strange, given that:

a. many ordinary people have only one form of photo I.D., namely, their
driver's license (and many don't even have that)

b. terrorists and other such persons are _very_ likely to have multiple
forms of I.D., though of course not in their "true name."

Hence, the policy looks ineffectual and just a sop to public relations.

And just what is a "true name" for the purposes of this law, anyway? Birth
name? And what is that? What about people who marry, change names, etc.?
Given that there is no "standard" for photo I.D.s, will my Official
Cypherpunks Card count?

I can easily make my own photo I.D.s, or even order "fake I.D.s" from
various mail-order outlets advertising in the Usual Places. If I show up at
the airline with two photo I.D.s, one showing me to be "Security Officer
Mickey Mouse" and the other showing me to be "Mickey Mouse, Internal
Security Agency," will I be violating any laws?

--Mickey Mouse (I just changed my name--if you don't like it, FAA, fuck off)
