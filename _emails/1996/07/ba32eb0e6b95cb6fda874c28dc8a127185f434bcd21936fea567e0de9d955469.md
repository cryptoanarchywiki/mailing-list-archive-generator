Not really:  Ordinary college students who use it to facilitate
cramming report that it has the same effect on them as on hyperactive
children.

A well known symptom of amphetamine abuse is that the abusers will
cheerfully persist in pointless and boring activities for hours
on end, such as folding paper bags or stirring long overcooked 
spaghetti.

Furthermore, people generally have to be forced by the threat of
violence to take depressant drugs, especially neuroleptics, whereas
everyone cheerfully takes their Ritalin.
