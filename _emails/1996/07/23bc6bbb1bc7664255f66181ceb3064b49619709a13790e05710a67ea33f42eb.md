C'punks,

We will be hosting a Cypherpunk meeting this Saturday the
13th.  Late notice, but better late than never.  Be prepared
to bring up your own topics, but I propose we spend some 
time discussion the meta-question of list dynamics.  Is the
Cypherpunks list a "sewer"?  Is there anything we can do to
improve signal-to-noise?  Do we need to?  Etc.

The meeting location will be at the Flatiron building in
San Francisco, aka 544 Market, aka 1 Sutter.  The building
sits on Market and Sutter at Sansome and near 2nd.  It is
right above the eastern end of the Montgomery BART station.
We will try to have someone in the lobby to let you in the
1 Sutter entrance, but if no one is there, call the office
so someone can come down (415-392-0526).  We will be in
the offices of Simple Access on the 5th floor.  The time
is noon to 6:00 or so.


 S a n d y

P.S.1.  We may have a surprise visitor.
P.S.2.  If you don't know about Cypherpunk Thai brunch
        on Sundays, ask me.  This Sunday, we are going
        shooting after we eat.
