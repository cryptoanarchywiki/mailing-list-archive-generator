No, but in things like Yahoo and Alta Vista, when they have those ads,
look at the URL assigned to the ad. It redirects you through the service
you're using rather than send you straight there. I don't know why. I
was just using an example....

Since HTML uses the < and > (less-than and greater-than) characters in
the code, you use the &lt; and &gt; to print one of these characters
and not use it in the code.
