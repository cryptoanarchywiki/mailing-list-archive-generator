May complains loudly about Meek and other writers style.

Meek hardily needs my defense, he's the best in the biz (speaking as 
another writer, I add, damn it!) But, your problem is simply one of 
style, not of substance. Like it or not, Meek does communicate well 
with the vast majority of his readers. His faux-Chandler isn't for 
everyone, but he makes his points loud and clear.
