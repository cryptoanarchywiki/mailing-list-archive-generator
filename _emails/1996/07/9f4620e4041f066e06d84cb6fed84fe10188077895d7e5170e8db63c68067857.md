That's true: when the state does not provide old-age pension,
that's the only alternative, and surely not a bad one.

As I see it, having more children makes sound economic sense when
you have child labor. You feed the child for 4-5 years, after
which it contributes financially to the family for the rest of
its short life. More stringent enforcement of anti child-labor
legislation would help. Increase in life expectancy is also good,
because then you need fewer children as insurance.

The spread of the Internet, and the ability to post anonymously
should help in exposing instances of violation of child-labor
laws, and increasing outrage. Hopefully, it will also make it
easier to spread literacy, which is arguably the best way to keep
population down.

I'd really like to know who this "he" is whom Robert is citing.
