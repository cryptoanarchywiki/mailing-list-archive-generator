Unexplained:   What if the program Microsoft is asked to sign is not 
intended for export?  Presumably, NSA has no authority, then, and thus 
presumably Microsoft shouldn't be able to refuse to sign anything they're 
asked.

Question:  Doesn't this set up an action by Microsoft which would be 
actionable under anti-trust laws (if it wasn't done at the behest of 
government?)


Couldn't somebody IMPORT a piece of encryption software, have it signed by 
Microsoft, then take the XOR of the signed and unsigned software and export 
it?  (It's not a tool capable of encryption...)

Or:  Microsoft presumably has foreign branches, or at least it could easily 
afford to set up one.  What's to stop Microsoft from signing foreign 
encryption software outside of the US?  The software is never exported 
(since it's already outside the country...), so there's no USA-law involv
ement.
