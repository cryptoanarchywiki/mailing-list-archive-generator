With much help from Tom Weinstein and a bit of luck, I have succeeded
in downloading the Linux version.  But the time I tried before it
finally worked, I typed in the New York City area code (212) rather
than the Cleveland area code (216) and since I had given them a
Cleveland address and ZIP code, they (the server, that is) said that I
had made an error.  So that must be one thing that they check.

It seems strange that they can require that you have a phone, let
alone that they require that your phone be in the same city where you
are.  (At one time I considered commuting between Cleveland and New
York.  I didn't consider it that seriously, but I am sure that there a
people who do exactly that.)
