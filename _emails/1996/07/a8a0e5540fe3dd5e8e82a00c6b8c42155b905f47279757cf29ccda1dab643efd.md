A claymore mine would be much better.  It would send the "ninjas" to hell, 
without necessarily forcing you to join them.

If tests are available that can detect trace amounts of drugs in your urine 30 
days after snorting cocaine, they ought to be able to detect traces of drugs in 
the toilet bowl/sewer pipe 5 minutes after you flush...

The whole "war on drugs" has been an excuse for abrogating our Constitutional 
rights.  Much of the impetus for banning "assault weapons" and "Saturday night 
specials" is a by-product of media hype of crimes committed by drug dealers and 
gangs.  Drug crime has been used as an excuse to involve the military in law 
enforcement, (That's how the FBI got the tanks involved at Waco!) and it has 
been the primary factor in the incrased popularity of SWAT raids.
