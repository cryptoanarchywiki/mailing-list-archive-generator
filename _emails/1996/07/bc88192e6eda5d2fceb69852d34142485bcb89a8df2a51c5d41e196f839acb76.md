They aren't a "thriving business". "They" are Shabbir and some
volunteers. No one works on it full time. "They" don't need any
money. Alexis Rosen at Panix donates their web space.

Vacant my ass. It should take you one guess to figure out what the
address actually is.

Mr. Safdar is a computer programmer in New York.

Shabbir doesn't drive. Most people who live in New York City don't.

I've known of him for years before he did VTW. You're on drugs.
