One, you could probably replace the wires with fiber/xmitter pairs.
However, this would probably screw your timings to hell - SCSI probably
wouldn't work.  OTOH, it's possible that with a careful enough job and
some decent components you could pull it off. It would be incredibly
wasteful, though, as you would need 40+ fibers to do the job of one...

I'd find some network cards that support fiber and breadboard a little
system together. Possibly, you could find a hookup that would work off
the shelf - look for sources for embedded systems. For instance, at least
Novell's networks have embedded system support. I recall a DDJ that had
someone wire up a coffemaker as a network controlled device, so I doubt
you'd need a PC.  As I recall, he had a single chip ethernet device. Now,
this was for regular ethernet, but I'd assume you could connect a fiber
based ethernet over with some sort of adapter.  Search for the article at
http://www.ddj.com - if you can't find it there, drop me a note.
