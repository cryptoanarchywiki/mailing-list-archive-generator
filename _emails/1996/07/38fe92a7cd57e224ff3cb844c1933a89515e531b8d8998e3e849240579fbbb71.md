The Nyquist Theorem states you need exactly twice the samples, not
over twice. The magic number isn't something like 2.2, its exactly
2. Now, the reality is that low pass filters in the recording studio
aren't going to be perfect and such, being analog devices, and higher
frequencies making it in will cause aliasing artifacts, so you
probably want to sample at above twice your putative cutoff because it
won't be your real cutoff, but in principle you need exactly twice the
highest frequency.
