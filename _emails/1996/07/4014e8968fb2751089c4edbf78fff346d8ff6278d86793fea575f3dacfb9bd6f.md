this is totally back to front.

The primary cause of terrorism, and indeed the primary party guilty of
terrorism in India *is* the government.

For example the war upon the Sikhs started off with government sponsored
terror against Sikh civilians, similar to Krystalnacht.

We mostly see terrorism in countries with a large and intrusive government,
not in countries like Hong Kong where there is massive government "neglect"

Oh wow:  So the Muslims of Kashmir were more upset by rigged elections
than by the murder of women and children.

If that is true, why do we not see terror in Hong Kong (no elections until
recently) and Singapore, (rigged elections)

Pull the other leg.  They even have a black lesbian quota.   US ambassadorships
had gay quota even under Reagan, though not a black lesbian quota.
