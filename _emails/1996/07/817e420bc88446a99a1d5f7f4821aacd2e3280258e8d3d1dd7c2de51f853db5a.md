Yes, I have written about the local "curfew" in my local newsgroup
(scruz.general), and I forwarded at least one of these articles to this
list, as you may recall.

Consistent with my views on gun control, mandatory doping of children, the
outlawing of certain dietary items, and on and on, I would be mighty pissed
if a kid of mine was picked up the cops and hauled off to a processing
center for eventual disposition for the thought crime of being on the
street without an excuse acceptable to the local gendarmes.

(In fact, I think I'd be tempted to just not answer any phone calls from
the reeducation center staffers; getting through to me on the phone can
often be difficult, of course, and I doubt they know about e-mail.)

I told someone in scruz.general who argued strongly for the need for
curfews on kids that her points had convinced me, that I now understood her
position, that I now agreed with it, and that I would be doing my part by
making a citizen's arrest of any curfew violators I found in my
area...especially cute 16-year-old girls. (I never heard from her
again...after she stopped foaming at the mouth she probably contacted the
Thought Crimes Task Force of the Sheriff's Department.)
