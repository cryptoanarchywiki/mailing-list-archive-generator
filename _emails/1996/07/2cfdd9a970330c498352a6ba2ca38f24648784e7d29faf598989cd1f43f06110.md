First of all, the goverrnment _has_ enforced ITAR; I've seen references
(ummm, on the net...) to a few cases of things like exporting TV decryptors,
as well as all the enforcement about illegal trafficking in guns and such.

But second, if you're threatened with jail and large fines, and have
to pay your lawyers lots of money to avoid being railroaded,
that's enforcement even if it's not the full-scale due process type.
