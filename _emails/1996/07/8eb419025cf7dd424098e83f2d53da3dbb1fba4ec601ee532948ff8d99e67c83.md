Hughes offers a downlink product called DirectPC.
The back channel is your regular modem.
Telco/Analog your requests to their servers 
and the data is delivered via your DSS dish,
sent to your PC and decoded via an ISA card. 
(Opt. DES downlink encryption)
http://www.direcpc.com/

The downlink is shared 500Kb/s ( I think ).
Though you can schedule a higher BW channel
for A/V applications (or so the lit reads).

Think it supports multicast/broadcast by default...
