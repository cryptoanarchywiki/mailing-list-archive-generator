The URL would still be visible in your ISP's http log and, in som cases, to
other users of the ISP. You'd have to cont on low traffic and little

of your home directory.

A case of an ISP closing someone's account because of an objection to an
unliked gif was sent to Declan's fight-censorship list a few days ago.
