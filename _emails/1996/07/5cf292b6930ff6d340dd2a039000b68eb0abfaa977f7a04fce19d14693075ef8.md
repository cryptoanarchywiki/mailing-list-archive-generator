	Try getting anything done from outside the country, where WATS lines
need not apply, thank you, even if you _do_ have your CDRs with you. The
amount of effort it takes to get around those %#$*ing 800 numbers from
outside the US is a nontrivial component in US companies losing business to
foreign competitors, imo.

	ObCrypto: non-net communications channels will necessarily play a big
part in any systematic effort among the G7+ to establish a transnational
GAK regime, and prickly details like disparities/imbalances in phone
systems will wreak havoc on a practical level. In fact, the
politico-economic dynamics that distort international telecom arrangements
will probably go a long way toward hobbling the "widening horizons of
police cooperation" the TLAs are aiming at. Then again, maybe the only
thing worse than international GAK might be an incompetently bureaucratized
international GAK system.
