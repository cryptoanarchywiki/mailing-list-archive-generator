At this point, I can see that we have agreed to disagree.  Mr. Watt has 
kindly quoted the exact text from Dobbertin, which I did not have handy.  
Let the readers of this list decide for themselves in regards to the 
security of MD5.

But I wanted to make two last comments before this thread (finally!) dies.

1. I think that you will agree that MD4 will work fine for Mr. Tridgell's 
program, irregardless of your criticisms.  He specifically stated that he 
was not concerned about intentional collisions, only random ones.

2.

As I understand the current plans, PGP 3.0 _will_ incorporate a SHA option. 
In fact, I believe that there may already be "bootleg" versions that 
incorporate SHA.
