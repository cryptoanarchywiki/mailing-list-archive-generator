In a "universe" of n-character passwords, whatever length n is, the use of
English, German, Elvish, Klingon, whatever words can be looked as
"galaxies."

(That is, clusters in an otherwise uniform space.)

Thus, "David" is one of the galaxies, and ""Da5id," "david," "Daphid," etc.
are just some of the stars in this galaxy of "nearby" strings.

Calculations of entropy and all. Be very careful.
