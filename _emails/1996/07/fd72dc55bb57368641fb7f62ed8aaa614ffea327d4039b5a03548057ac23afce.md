At this year's DefCon (last weekend), there were two speakers from the
recently created FBI San Francisco Computer Crime division.  During a 
question/answer session, the question came up regarding their division's
view on crypto as compared to the FBI's official view.  They, of course,
declined to answer on the grounds that they were instructed not to talk
about it, and proceeded to explain how they just enforce the law, not 
create it (deftly ignoring the point made about Freeh's involvement in
making laws).  The question was rephrased: "How do you personally feel
about exporting strong crypto", and again they refused to answer on the
grounds that they were there as spokesmen for the FBI, but people could
talk to them later and ask any questions they liked, and "the answers may
surprise you".  Evidence that maybe some goons really do have a clue, but
are still too afraid to do anything about it... //cerridwyn//
