After much fiddling, I've found (IMHO) a "good" way of using secure drive
1.4a under Win95.  After doing the partitioning and encrypting, put the
following in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file...

cd\utils\secdr14a
sectsr
login D: /S
@choice /T:N,1
@if errorlevel 2 goto ContinueLoad
:EnterPP
login D:
@if errorlevel 1 goto Again
@if errorlevel 0 goto ContinueLoad
:Again
@choice Try again?
@if errorlevel 2 goto ContinueLoad
@goto EnterPP
:ContinueLoad
cd\
cls

abviously you have to replace the D: with your drive letter, and the
directory at the top with your SECDR14a dir.  Then, in Win95 you have to
turn off 32 bit disk access.  To do this without losing all the speed of
virtual memory, do the following...
  right-click on My Computer
  click on Properties, Performance, File System, Troubleshooting
  and check the box labeled: Disable all 32 bit protect-mode disk drivers.
  Re-boot.

If you have a CD-ROM drive, you will have to load the DOS drivers in order
to be able to access it.

Granted, this is just a kludge until Secure Drive is re-designed for Win95,
but I've tried a dozen different combinations, and this gives you all the
SecDrv security under Win95 (except being able to lock/unlock after Win95
starts) and sacrafices the least amount of system performance.

Enjoy!
 
                                                     G.C.G.
