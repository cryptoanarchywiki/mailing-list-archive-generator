The problem is getting PPP to work under DOS.  If your kid can do that, then
he will have no problem in disabling any sort of filtering, as well as
wiping the hard drive and installing Linux with X11R6.  DOS stacks are a
pain to get functioning, usually have little to no useful instructions, and
tend to be harder than hell to find.  (Or as Homer Simpson once said:
"Mmmmmm! Packet drivers!")

I expect to see a case where some kid gets in trouble for filtering out what
his parents can see, read, or hear.  Or sets the school filter to only allow
going to porno sites.

I find it humorous how many people think that they can use technology to
babysit their kids when the kids understand the technology much better than
they do in most cases...
