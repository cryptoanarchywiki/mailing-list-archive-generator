Has anyone thought about TI or Motorolas DSP-Eval-Boards (at 99$ a piece at 
40 MHz with optimized assembler they might easily outrun a PPro200)
Don't look at me that way, I know only little about DSP-Programming.

>>> DSP's are optimized for add/multiply ... and you get their 
memory-access pipelining; but I am not too sure how they'd do on a DES 
algo.  I wouldn't get too excited.
