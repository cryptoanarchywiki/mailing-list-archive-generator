Hmmhhh....I post about the "Net and Terrorism" on Sunday, and the Viper
Militia and their plans to blow up several courthouses in Phoenix are
revealed a few hours later....Snow posts about using computers to knock out
the power grid, and a few hours later power goes out over 15 western
states....

Coincidence? I think not.

But we can test this hypothesis:

"Alien spaceship images will appear in thousands of darkened rooms and will
trigger mass hysteria."

We'll find out tomorrow if Cypherpunks really do have the Power.

Boycott "Big Brother Inside" software!
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
