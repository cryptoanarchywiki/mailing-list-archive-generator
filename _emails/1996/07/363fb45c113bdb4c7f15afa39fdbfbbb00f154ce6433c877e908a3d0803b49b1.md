Everything you described is an abuse of administration mistakes and has
nothing to do with hacking (?) an irc/ircd. There are numerous patches
to prevent it.
As for "hacking irc" -- it is pretty indefinete what could it be...
Intruding to machine which is running an irc server isn't something new --
it is just a machine with an ircd running. Exploiting administration to hack
mistakes isn't anything new either -- there's lot's of idiotss abusing server's
code bugs, to say, +k bug to fight each other.
Anyhow, I do not thing this discussion has any future, as long as there's
nothing to discuss.
