  The Department of State tells us that permission was granted to
MIT and others under the "old policy".  The "new policy" has not
been completed, which led to long delays in our getting approval.
Our current approval is temporary, pending release of the "new
policy".  In order to get this permission we agreed to ask for and
archive this information, in case law enforcement required it for
some related investigation.  The following statement is at the
bottom of the page, near the submit button:

	ALL SUBMISSIONS ARE LOGGED
        Misrepresentation or omission of facts is covered under
	ITAR 127.2(a) and (b)(13).
	These data will only be released to satisfy lawful requests by
	government agencies, should such requests be made.

  That last sentance means that we won't be selling the list to
telemarketers, or making it publicly available.

  If you are not comfortable providing this information, then you
may either run the export version, or purchase the retail navigator
package, which also includes the US only version when sold in the US.
