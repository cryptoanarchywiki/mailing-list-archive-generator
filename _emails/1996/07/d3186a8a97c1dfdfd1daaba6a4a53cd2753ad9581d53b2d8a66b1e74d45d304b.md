Since you say you have procmail, you could try something along this
(as yet untested) line:

:2HB
cypherpunks@toad.com
^dear friend
/dev/null

I find that people who address me as "Dear Friend" are invariably
pushing some kind of chain letter, religion, multi-level marketing scam,
or the like.  My real friends _know_ my name.
