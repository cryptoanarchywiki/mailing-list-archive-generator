If the purpose is for use with "Crack" or some similar program, it might be
better than you would think.  You won't get the "unusual" words, but you
will also get the words in common usage that do not appear in dictionaries.
(Such as fnord, jedi, killfile, and the like...)  You will also get alot of
proper names, which may have been used as passwords.  The idea is that words
in common usage may be more likely to be used as passwords.

Another thing to look for when choosing dictionaries/wordlists for crack is
not sticking to english.  If you have a userbase that is known to have a
certain percentage of people of a non-english background, you will want to
find lists of words from that background.  (I had a sysadmin asking me about
Yiddish and Hebrew wordlists for just that reason.)  These can be a bit
harder.  (Especially for unusual languages.)  But knowing your userbase can
make all the difference in what it might take to crack the passwords from
the outside.
