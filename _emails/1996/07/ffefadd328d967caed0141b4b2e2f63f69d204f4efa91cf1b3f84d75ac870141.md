     Maybe we're just a bit afraid of how society treats it's members,
and how parents treat our future employees/servants/neighbors. 

     We are not trying to pass laws that say people _can't_ give their 
kids drugs, just questioning the wisdom of passing the pills out like
they are candy to children. They same children we tell not to smoke a 
little pot because "we don't know how it affects young minds".

     Speed is a little more potent than Pot. Just a little.

     If someones life is being ruined because their parents are forcing 
them to take these pills.

     No arguements here. I'd be the last to say "Do things Naturally", 
but chemical addictions suck really hard.

     Quit taking Caffine 2 years ago, and quit smoking 2 weeks ago. 
     Hell, since I quit working for one of the big 6 accounting firms, I 
rarely have headaches, so you could say that leaving the High Tech Hi-Rise
life Style _did_ cure me to an extent. (that was a joke boy). 
     I really don't think that anyone here is claiming that there are no 
mental problems, just that maybe it is best not to throw powerful drugs 
at people we don't even trust to drive a car.
