I don't find it surprising (a different word from "funny") that you are a
kind of "conservative." Many folks calling themselves conservatives
actually want various kinds of laws, safety nets, social order, etc. (Many
"conservative farmers" want government price guarantees, for example.)

This is quibbling. Use whatever other word or weasel phrase for "fail to
save" and "drink too much." Common euphemisms are: "became a victim of
ethanol addiction," "lacked personal financial skills," etc.

My point was an obvious one, clearly made, which I won't repeat here.

This is fatuous nonsense. I made no comment even remotely similar to this.
(In fact, in my view, a woman can wear a tiny string bikini and, if
attacked, blow away her attacker; though the bikini may make concealed
carry a bit harder.)

The likely reason you are confused is that you set up a straw man, found it
conflicted with other things I have argued, and now wish me to "explain."

I have strongly argued against curfews, as I don't want cops telling my
15-year-old child when she or he can and can't be on public roads.

As to "insurance," be my guest. That is, you and others are perfectly able
to form insurance pools, old age retirement funds, etc. These are usually
called "pension plans."

However, please don't hold a gun to my head and demand that I contribute to
a plan, especially one which is a Ponzi scheme like Social Security (SS is
not self-funding, and "IOUs" are being placed in the pot for the future, as
is well-known.)

Sounds fair to me.

A bad form of argument, citing bad SF movies to prove your points.
