I didn't say that binaries couldn't be signed.  I said they couldn't be
*clear*-signed.  There is a difference between clearsigning and creating a
signature certificate that is either concatenated with the data or written
to a separate file.  If somebody who doesn't have PGP gets a file that is
signed by PGP, the file is completely useless to that person.
