Oh really?

I got off the phone yesterday with the people who handle my student loans.
It seems they don't "have" a regular number.

*right*.

It took me about 15 calls on their part, and alot of pissiness on my part
to finally get a local (Ohio) number for them.  

Gotta love those collection agencies.

And NO they don't list anything other than their 800 number, and refuse 
to give it out.

Who is paranoid here?
