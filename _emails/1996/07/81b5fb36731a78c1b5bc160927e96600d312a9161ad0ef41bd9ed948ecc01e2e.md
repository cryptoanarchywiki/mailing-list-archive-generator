I hope there is a way to put all the keys into a single key block.

This is ok...

But I think this is a horrible mistable.  Besides the fact that there
is no "PGP 3.0" (there is "PGPlib", however), why isn't your code
compatible with the implementation that we're working on?  This can be
highly confusing when PGPlib comes out and messages signed with PGPlib
can't be verified by your code, and vice-versa.  Bad idea, Zig.

HUH?  Where did you get this faulty information?  PGPlib (as I said,
there is no PGP 3.0) will have full 2.6 support.  So, I don't know
where you heard this, but I would recommend you verify your
information with people close to the project before spreading more FUD
around.

Enjoy!
