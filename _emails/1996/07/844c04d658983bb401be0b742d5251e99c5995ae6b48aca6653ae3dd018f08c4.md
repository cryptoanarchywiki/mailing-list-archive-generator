This is not correct. The one-time pad is "information-theoretically
secure," as proved early on by Shannon. This is much more than being
"cryptographically secure," for which the term "brute force" is applicable
(albeit essentially still impossible, for a large enough work factor).

(I just looked at later posts and saw your response to Simon Spero's
rebuttal: "Theoretically Simon is right. Nevertheless one-time pads have
been broken
through trial and error when they have been reused either out of laziness
or force majeure." It is _very_ important that people understand that
"reusing a pad" is not a valid use of a _one-time_ pad. Such misuse, while
important in actual cryptanalytic history, is no more a "brute forcing" of
the pad than is buying a key from an opponent, obtaining it through
burglary, etc. All important methods of cracking codes, but not at all what
is meant by "brute force.")
