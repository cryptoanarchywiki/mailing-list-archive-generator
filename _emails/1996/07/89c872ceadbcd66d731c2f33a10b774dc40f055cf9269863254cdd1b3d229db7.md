Agreed... but there should be mention of stuff like "Here's our new
cryptosystem, try and crack it. If you do, we'll give you the software
free," or "here's a big block of ciphertext we encrypted with our
proprietary algorithm which we won't describe, try and crack it, but
it is unbreakable, however if you do crack it you win a free trip
to visit us."

Distinguishing what sounds to be a real contest and what sounds like a 
marketing gimmick would be good.

   Ken Thompson has an automobile which he helped design.  Unlike most
   automobiles, it has neither speedometer, nor gas gage, nor any of the
   numerous idiot lights which plague the modern driver.  Rather, if the
   driver makes any mistake, a giant "?" lights up in the center of the
   dashboard.  "The experienced driver", he says, "will usually know
   what's wrong."
