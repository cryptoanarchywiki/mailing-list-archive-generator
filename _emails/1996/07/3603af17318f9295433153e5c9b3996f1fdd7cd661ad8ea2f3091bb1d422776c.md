To make this quite clear...I am not anti any geographical space that has a
name such as USA or any other name, as it is an inanimate substance.

You would ONLY be right about classification and restrictions *IF* the
information came from the USA, from a "restricted" or "classified" person,
otherwise you are wrong. Remember not all info comes from the USA.

No, but the KEA algorithms, the Skipjack algorithm used in the fortezza, 
etc.  Were developed inthe US, by the NSA,   with US dollars from taxpayers 
(for better or worse).

THIS info does happen to be form, by and of the NSA, sorry.

You are being childish.
