 An entity calling itself tcmay@got.net (Timothy C. May) probably
 wrote something like:

I know a lot about Rand, and about her deep flaws as an
individual, especially in terms of treatment of her supporters,
but this is the first I've heard of this one.  Perhaps Tim is
thinking of a play by Murray Rothbard called "Mozart Was a Red" 
in which the Ayn Rand caricature insists that her followers 
smoke.


As for smoking being "proof" of man's dominance over nature,
Rand _did_ believe that in the sense of "demonstration" or
"symbol" but she did not believe that in the rigorous sense of
"proof".
