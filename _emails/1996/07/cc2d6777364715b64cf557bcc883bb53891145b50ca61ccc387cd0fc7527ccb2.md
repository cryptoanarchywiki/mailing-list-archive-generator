Speaking of poison's, and finding pipe-bomb info on the net and such, i
might add that it is probably safer to let your children on the net than
it is to let them play near a vegitable garden.  That is, at least if you
grow tomatos...

P.S. -- for those who don't know, Tomatos were, for many years, thought to
be poisonous, and whoever ate them and lived were considered to be
witches.  The reason for this is that tomato leaves have a high
concentration of CN in them.  If you don't know what CN is, just remember
not to eat any  tomato leaves, and don't drop them in HCl either.
