It occurs to me that a bare fiber could actually be (randomly) hung across 
treetops, roofs, power lines, and various other structures, over a 
many-block distance in suburban areas.    Such a fiber wouldn't be protected 
very well, but it would probably last a few months.  It would also be 
exceedingly hard to find its terminations, and tracing it would be a real 
pain.  (It probably wouldn't be visible against a bright sky more than a 
meter or two away.)
