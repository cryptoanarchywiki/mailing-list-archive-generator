The cypherpunks list has been discussing ITAR again. :-)

>>illegal?

Exporting components of military hardware, including cryptosystems,
is also specifically banned by ITAR.  How big a piece is enough to get
you prosecuted is a question for the nastiest of the N prosecutors out there,
and whether you can be convicted is a question for the best of
the 12 jurors you'll have....

Vince Cate's arms exporter page lets you export a highly-useful
fully working cryptosystem in three lines with one mouse click
(developed by Adam Back and an international cast of dozens.)

Adam Back's export-three-lines-of-PGP-at-once is a more blatant
test of this; go see his web pages.

Here's my two bits worth - the following bits are components of
PGP, Netscape 3.0b5, and also of RSAREF.
        0
        1
