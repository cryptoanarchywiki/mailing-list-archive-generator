Yup. He was speaking only of the US company. As you mentioned, odds of anyone 
getting caught are fairly low in many cases, but even lower for anyone
outside the US.
 The odds the US would go after a foreign company would seem pretty remote,
unless
 based in a country that strongly suppported US policy. The UK comes to
mind, but few
 others. I'll leave it others to decide who else should be on that list.
