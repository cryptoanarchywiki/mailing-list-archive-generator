So, how will the identity of the cardholder be tracked when they are
transferred physically from one person to another?

Presumably bank tracking will only work when the card is submitted to a
"public" terminal.  "Wallet" transfers won't be tracked immediately.  Also,
if an API is realeased, interesting possibilities are created.
