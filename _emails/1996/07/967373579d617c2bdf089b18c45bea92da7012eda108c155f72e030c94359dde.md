However, parents are free not to purchase filtering software that claims that
their criteria is a trade secret.  I don't see this as a threat at all.  The
parents who refuse to buy this software don't have to worry about the filtering
software preventing little Johnny from visiting a site that has information
on homosexuality or subscribing to a computer science mailing list (which are
apparently blocked by some filtering software for some reason).
