Vlad: How can consumers make an informed decision as to which filter
they wish to purchase, if they are not told exactly what information
each product is filtering out?

Meeks et al may be guilty of flamboyant, emotionalistic prose, but I
find the concept that the public is expected to buy various filters
without knowing what they filter...frankly, ridiculous.
