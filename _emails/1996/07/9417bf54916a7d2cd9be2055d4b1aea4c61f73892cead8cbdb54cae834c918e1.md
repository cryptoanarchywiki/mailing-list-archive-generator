   Fireworks expected at Thursday encryption hearing 
 
            
   Washington, July 24 (Reuter) -- After sailing through two 
   quiet subcommittee hearings, a bill to relax restrictions 
   on computer encoding faces a much choppier ride before the 
   full Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday. 
 
   The committee will hear from some of the Clinton 
   administration's big guns on crime and national security, 
   including FBI Director Louis Freeh and William Crowell, 
   deputy director of the National Security Agency. [Snip] 
 
   Netscape's James Barksdale, who entranced senators at a 
   June 12 subcommittee hearing, will return Thursday to again 
   make the case for relaxing export restrictions. [Snip] 
 
   Others expected to testify Thursday include William 
   Reinsch, undersecretary for the Bureau of Export 
   Administration at the Commerce Department; Tandem Computers 
   Inc. President Roel Pieper; and Grover Norquist, president 
   of Americans for Tax Reform. 
 
   The hearing will be broadcast live over the Internet, 
   starting at about 9:15 a.m. EDT using Progressive Network's 
   Real Audio software. The technique was first used at a June 
   26 subcommittee hearing on the encryption bill.
