DIMACS Workshop on Trust Management in Networks

Dates: Sept. 30 - Oct. 2, 1996

Location: CORE Bldg., Rutgers University Busch Campus, Piscataway NJ

Co-Chairs: Ernie Brickell, Bankers Trust, brickell@btec.com
           Joan Feigenbaum, AT&T Research, jf@research.att.com
           Dave Maher, AT&T Research, dpm@research.att.com


Theme: The use of public-key cryptography on a mass-market scale
requires sophisticated mechanisms for managing trust.  For example,
any application that receives a signed request for action is forced to
answer the central question ``Is the key used to sign this request
authorized to take this action?''  In certain applications, this
question reduces to ``Does this key belong to this person?'' In
others, the authorization question is considerably more complicated,
and resolving it requires techniques for formulating security policies
and security credentials, determining whether particular sets of
credentials satisfy the relevant policies, and deferring trust to
third parties.  This workshop covers all aspects of the trust
management problem.  Relevant topics include but are not limited to:

          General approaches to trust management
          Languages, systems, and tools
          Certificates and public-key infrastructure 
          Formal models and analysis
          Trust management in specific application domains,
                including but not limited to:
                Banking
                E-mail
                Internet commerce
                Licensing
                Medical information systems
                Mobile programs and ``code signing''
                Revocation of cryptographic keys


Confirmed speakers include:

          Butler Lampson, Microsoft
          Matt Blaze, AT&T Research
          Steve Kent, BBN 
          Carl Ellison, Cybercash
