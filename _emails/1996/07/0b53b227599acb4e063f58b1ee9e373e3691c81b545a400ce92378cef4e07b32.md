I must agree with Lucky.  I am quite sure that even if Netscape was not
begin distributed over the net, copies would still be uploaded to
international sites by folks practicing Civil disobedience.  Only they'd
have to wait to get the release from a store or some other source.

If you think the net distribution channel is in danger, consider these
suggestions.  The basic idea is to provide plausible denyability that
the net site was the source of the "leak".

Offer to send the latest version on floppy to US addresses of
the first 100 people who request them.  I only suggest 100 to keep your
costs down.  But any decent sized number would do.

I got my copy bundled with my ISP software.  So make sure your ISP and
other redistributers have their copies a few days before you make it
available on the net.  Then new ISP accounts will start getting copies
before the net copies become available.

This may not work as well for beta's, but I'm sure other approaches
along these lines would work too.  Of course, it make sense to make sure
the binaries used in each of these channels are indistinguishable.
