I'm not following you.  I don't think many people on this list are faced with
the problem of getting around software used to filter out pornography, drug
info, and other evil things tearing at the moral fiber of today's youth.
(Hint: I write this with tongue firmly in cheek.)

Using a hardware based filter is about as bad as using the IP security header
fields for content descriptions.  It's not at the level where filtering
belongs.  Filtering should be at the software level where it currently is.
Since this can easily be broken, it might be better to have "Kid Safe" ISP's
that would use a firewall to filter data.
