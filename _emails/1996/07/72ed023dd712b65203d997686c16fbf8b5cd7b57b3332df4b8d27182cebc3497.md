     As previously discussed, I am announcing a Greater Chicago Area 
CypherPunks Physical Meet. 

     The date is Saturday, 3 August 1996 at or around 4 p.m. at 
Ye Olde Saint Andrews Pub, 5938 N. Broadway, Chicago Il. Instructions are 
at the end of this post. 

     Things _I_ would like to discuss, of course, this is me, so it is very
amenable to changer:

     1) Setting up a Chicago Area Remailer, not simply running a single
remailer on a single account, but trying to go one better. 

     2) Discuss the possibility of a public event to spread the word about
cryptography/encryption. 

     3) Discuss the next meeting. 

The reasons for selecting St. Andrews Inn:

     1) It is relatively empty. 
     2) It has Food (Supposedly real good shepard's pie, made from real 
shepards(I asked)), Drink (Cider, and they know what snakebite is), and 
Non-alcoholic beverages. 
     3) It is easy (relatively) to get to. 


To get to St. Andrews Inn:

     By Car: Take Lake Shore Drive North until the LSD ends. 
             Go North on Sheridan (right turn off of LSD) to Thorndale 
                (About 5900 North) 
             Turn left on Thorndale (heading west) and drive to Broadway 
                (About 4 or 5 blocks) 
             Park. 
             St. Andrews is on the North West Corner of the intersection, 
                 under the green awning. 
      
     By El: Take the Red Line (Howard/Dan Ryan) to Thorndale 
            Go west 1/2 block from the El, This is Broadway
            St. Andrews is on the North West Corner of the intersection, 
                under the green awning. 

     I will try to have a map up at http://www.encodex.com/cypherpunks 
later today.
