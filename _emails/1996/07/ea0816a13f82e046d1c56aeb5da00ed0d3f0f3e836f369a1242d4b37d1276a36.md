The attached note appears to have been sent to all ISPs in the
Philippines. It asks them to report back on how they can "block entry of
pornographic materials through the INTERNET." Note how it equates 
censoring porn with preventing sex tourism.

General information about international net-censorship is at:

Thanks to David Sobel for forwarding this.

TO: ALL REGISTERED VALUE ADDED SERVICES PROVIDERS
RE: REQUEST OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO BAR OR BLOCK
    ENTRY OF PORNOGRAPHIC MATERIALS THROUGH THE INTERNET

The Special Committee for Children, constituted pursuant to E.O. 275 dated
14 September 1995, is tasked to ensure the special protection of children 
from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, exploitation, discrimination and 
other conditions prejudicial to their development. Said Committee takes 
action on specific issues involving the implementation of the provisions of
R. A. 7610 which covers several areas of concern, among others, child 
prostitution and other sexual abuse; child trafficking; obscene publications
and indecent shows using children as performers or models; other acts of
neglect, abuse, cruelty or exploitation and other conditions predjudicial
to the child's development.

The Committee has raised the concern on the INTERNET being used as a very 
convenient medium for advertising sex tourism in the Philippines, with 
particular focus on the alleged availability of Filipino children for sexual
liaisons and entertainment. Some materials used in the network for the 
afformentioned puprose were given to this Commission.

Secretary Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr., Department of Justice, requested this
Commission to bar or block entry of pornographic materials through the 
INTERNET.

In view of this, you are requested to give your comments/position and 
suggestions on this matter, particularly on the possibility of barring or 
blocking pornographic materials through the INTERNET, and submit the same to 
this Commission by 18 July 1996 attention to Director Edgardo V. Cabarios,
CCAD at fax no. 921-7128.

Your cooperation and prompt action on this matter is greatly appreciated.

Signed
Simeon J. Kintanar
Commissioner
