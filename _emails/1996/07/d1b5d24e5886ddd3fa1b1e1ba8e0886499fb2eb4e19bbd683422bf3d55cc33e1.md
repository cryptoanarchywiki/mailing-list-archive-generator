Russell was a very eloquent opponent of the death penalty and in
any case it was never in particularly widespread use in the UK
during his lifetime. It is somewhat pointless to argue that his later 
opposition  to nuclear weapons was motivated by affinity for the 
Soviet Union Russell was a convinced Pacifist before the Soviet 
Union came into existence, going to jail because of his beliefs. 

I don't know quite why you seem to have picked up the idea that he
was some kind of Stalin appologist, he wasn't even a Marxist. Russell
was far too intelligent to be taken in by the communists, he didn't
waste many words on them but those he did were generally 
uncomplimentary. He was very contemptuous of Wittgenstein's 
brief attempt to become a Soviet pessant.

Its an odd kind of world view you have in which anyone who does
not agree with your views must be a communist sympathiser. Its
not even the case that the left were uniformly sympathetic to
communism as the example of George Orwell makes very clear. The
vocabulary of the cold war was established by a socialist
propagandist on the basis of a speech by a socialist Prime 
Minister. Churchill made the original "iron curtain" remark, but 
it was after Atlee's speech to the UN which left the USSR unable
to reply and thus established the basis of engagement. 


If you are going to make ad-hominem attacks you should at least
try to get them on target.
