	Most people reading this are likely to wonder "how could overseas
Net surfers downloading it hurt anyone?", although some wil have their minds
go blank (or blanker than normal) at the mention of "terrorist groups." A
mixed set of news coverage, overall. As usual (even if I forget to state it),
edited to try to stay within fair use.
