No, the argument is over whether a person should live by the ideals he
preaches. I have more respect fot the likes of Kant and Russell who made
rather more of an effort than Jefferson.

The observation that history is made by rich people and written by rich 
people is not a new one. Until this century there were few countries
where politics were open to anyone but the very wealthy. In the USA
that is still by and large the case.

Rather than attempting to excuse Jefferson it would be better to
accept that not everything he said was valid when he said it and
to try to engage ones brain rather than using his words as slogans.

Since they are denied the "right" to live in Libertopia they have
no choice but to live in the real world. That doesn't make them
hypocrites. They are not directly contradicting their principles.

On the other hand there are plenty of "free-market" economists
who live entirely on grant money from the public purse and plenty
of those "libertarians" will be accepting government assisted
funding through college or would do so if it was available.

Yes, but how can a Randite libertarian do so in good faith? For such
people there is no greater good, it is all the self.
