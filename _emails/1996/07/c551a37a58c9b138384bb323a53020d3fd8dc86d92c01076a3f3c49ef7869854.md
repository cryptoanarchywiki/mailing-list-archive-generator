This is shocking, shocking.  It never occurred to me that our government
would charge us for the benefit of being tapped.  What about the poor.  I'm
going to write Senator Kennedy and see if maybe we can get the selfish
Republican Congress to free up some cash so that less fortunate Americans
can afford to be tapped too.

This argument against key escrow never made it onto that long list of
questions we made up in the Spring of '93 when Key Escrow was first proposed
by the Admin (it was probably Vince Foster's fault).  We showed a lack of
imagination.

"Gee Ossifer I'd love to let you read my files but I just couldn't afford
expensive socialistic key escrow so I bought cheap efficient private key
escrow instead."
