I'm not sure what you had in mind for differing behaviours (were you
thinking nuking of data variety?), but I think the option for multiple
hidden file systems may be a feature some people would want.

However, I think it would greatly reduce an individuals plausible
deniability of there existing a 2nd hidden file system, if they admit
to a 1st hidden file system.  They have admitted that they are willing
to play the duress key game, so what's to say they haven't done it
again.
