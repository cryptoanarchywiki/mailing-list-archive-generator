   That and the fact that it can be physically sickening to the people 
who have to be around such individuals.

    The government can't do much about accidental bathtub deaths though.  
Terrorism can be dealt with on a much more tangible level.

    I look at it this way.  Information warfare has the *potential* of 
being as potentially destructive as conventional warfare due to the very 
nature of our country's infrastructure.  However, when we look at other 
means of war that were supposed to be the "ultimate" force, like nuclear 
weapons, we've historically seen that they work better as pawns in the 
power struggle rather than as actual playing pieces.

    The main difference between nukes and infowar is that an attack by 
the latter means is more feasible for just about anyone as opposed to an 
actual country or powerful organization having nukes.

    Neither have I.  It would seem that the government has worked more 
towards actively discouraging any good infosec policies than helping 
out.  Let them take care of foreign nations amassing large groups of 
Internet connected work stations in their military bases and I think we 
can handle the infrequent malicious individual.
