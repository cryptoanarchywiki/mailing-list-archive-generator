Perry Metzger, in a profound display of stubbornness, continues
educating AwakenToMe@aol.com.

But how about this C prog:

z(int d,char*s){for(*s='a';*s<='z';(*s)++)d?z(d-1,s-1):puts(s);}
BS(s){char *S=(char*)malloc(s+1);S[s]=0;z(s-1,S+s-1);free(S);}
main(){BS(2);}

is there anything shorter and no less efficient? most of time is wasted 
in puts of course
