Yes, that's the anti-trust vulnerability I mentioned.  It is unclear if 
Microsoft could legitimately refuse to sign any software presented to it, 
regardless of its legal exportability.

I'm sure that will happen!

What MS would be signing for is the GENUINENESS of the software, not its 
effectiveness.  Sorta analogous to key-signatures in PGP.
