Dear flamer,

Obviously, you did not learn to read.  Go back to school.

I asked the root@mail.demon.net to explain why I was blocked and I
asked CPunks to reply to the post "below", which was my original
question.


What I asked on the CPunks list was the following:

Is the fact that a realdeal.exe /per (wiped with zeroes)  processed
drive weakens the idea encryption of a Secure Drive 1.4a'ed drive?

So, dear anonymous coward, go to hell.
