I thought it was interesting to not that a Republican Senator came to
california to talk about this stuff and *neither* of the California
Senators has got a clue yet.

One questioner from the audience made an interesting point that given
that most of american can't seta vcr clock crypto will be totally
beyond them unless it becomes pervasive ("you can buy it at radio shack").

It was pretty clear from all the speaker that this is a
libertarian/authoritarian issue and not a liberal/conservative one.
