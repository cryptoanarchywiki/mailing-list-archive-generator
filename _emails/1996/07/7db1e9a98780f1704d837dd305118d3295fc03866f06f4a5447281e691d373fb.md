Here's an easy attack on a pseudo-DC-net that I thought up over lunch if
the clients trust the server to be honest in telling both the round number
and who is on.

Let Stephanie be the person running the server, and let Alice and Bob be
two users.  Let f(n) be the pseudo random function they share.   Assume
that Stephanie knows their secret encryption key.  It is then possible
for her to compromise their anonymity as follows: First Alice joins the
net, and Stephanie tells her that it is round 100 and Bob is on. Alice
sends a messages. Stephanie sends back some random junk to Alice to
convince her that there was a collision.   Alice backs off for a few
rounds. Stephanine now receives f(101), f(102), f(103), etc. and then tells
Alice that Bob has left.  Alice leaves now. Later Bob joins. Stephanine
tells him that it is round 101 and Alice is here. Bob starts talking right
away, sending three message: f(101) xor M1, f(102) xor M2, and f(103) xor
M3.   From this Stephanie is able to recover M1, M2, and M3 by xor'ing
f(101), f(102), and f(103), which she has from before, back in. Bob has
completely lost his anonymity! 

Thus, it looks like trusting the server for both who is on and the round
number is a bad idea! It might be possible to remove the need for a round
number if the number of seconds since channel creation is used instead, and
the clients are time synchronized. In that case running the pseudo-DC-net
on top of UDP might be preferable to running it on top of TCP. 

Can anyone think of an attack if the server is just trusted for a list of
who is on? If there is one, I guess new clients could ask for signed
messages of who is on: "It is 456 seconds since channel creation, and,
I---Alice---am on. (signature)". That would complicate the protocol, of
course, and cost Nancy---a new client---some time in verifying the
signatures. 

Good attacks so far! Keep 'em coming. :)
