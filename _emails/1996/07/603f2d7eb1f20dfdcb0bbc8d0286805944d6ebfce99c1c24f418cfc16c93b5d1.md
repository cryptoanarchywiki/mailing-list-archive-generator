If the value of a Turing is one tenth of an American cent, then it would
actually just be a pseudocurrency backed by U.S. dollars.  The inflation of
ecash would be the same as the inflation of U.S. money.  However, I do agree
that the value of one unit should be low.

You use Moore's Law to state that the cost of electronic transactions drops
exponentially.  However, this is only true if the electronic transactions
use the same amount of bandwidth.  As chip processing speed and transmission
bandwidth double, the cost of building the equipment also doubles.
