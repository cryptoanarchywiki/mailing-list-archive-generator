Too bad. Properly modularized software, i.e., with a place to drop in the
specific system/algorithm being attacked, could be adapted quickly to
DES-busting, or whatever.

If your friend still has this, and it's not just spaghetti code, maybe he
can adapt it to a truly large-scale attack.

BTW, sitting in my hot tub last night I quickly reconstructed the math for
the "random" keyspace inefficiency:

-- Imagine that N users are "randomly" picking chunks of keyspace to
search. That is, they are not coordinating with others to avoid
duplication.

-- By the time the total amount of computons expended has equalled the
amount that would have been expended in a "no duplications" allocated
search, the Poisson probability distribution says that 1/e = 36.8% of the
keyspace will not have been searched; the rest of the probabilty lies in
keyspace searched once, twice, three times, etc.

-- Thus, the calculation will have to go 2-4 times longer to give a high
(>95%) chance that the answer is found. For example, at 3 times the
"efficient" search time, there is only a 1/e^3 = 5% chance that nobody has
found the answer

The probabalistic assignment is less efficient, obviously, but has the
advantage of not requiring a registry of keyspace allocations. Further,
"denial of service" attacks (lying about having searched a chunk, or
incorrectly searching or reporting) are not a problem.
