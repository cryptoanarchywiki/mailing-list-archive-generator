Agreed.  Also, we might want to keep the plaintext on, say, a floppy disk,
as to discourage the recovery technique (which, admitidly, is easier than
actually cracking the key).  I might suggest, also, to put the disks in
the hands of someone who has little or no reason to help.  Sadly, the best
person for the job that _I_ can think of would have to be "Dr." Dave.

Or hack it to use a 56 bit IP netmask-ish thing, and keep track of keys
that way (i'm not endorsing this idea, just pointing it out)
