Yes, editing is difficult, often a trial-and-error effort if you don't 
know what the site is looking for. You generally end up with a cookie 
that is ignored by the server, which then acts as though no cookie were 
involved.

I have yet to see a "damaging" cookie, outside of the stupidity of trying 
to pass a plain-text password across the 'net for storage on the client. 
Anybody seen any interesting problematic cookies?

- r.w.
