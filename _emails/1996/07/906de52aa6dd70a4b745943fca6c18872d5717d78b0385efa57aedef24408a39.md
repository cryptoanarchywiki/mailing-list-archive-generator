Good point... but why limit false sense of security as to what
governments or corporations can do.  Poor passphrases, leaving
plaintext files around (perhaps not wiping them), and even having
incriminating conversations with folks on the 'net one doesn't know
under the belief that encryption makes it safe, etc. etc. are probably
more dangerous security holes.
