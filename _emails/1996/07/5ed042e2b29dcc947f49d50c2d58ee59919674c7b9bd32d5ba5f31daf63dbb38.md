I'm sorry, but this thread is making no sense.

You wondered aloud why Tim would make moral judgements; I claim he
didn't.  What exactly was it you were trying to say?

So you're saying that you made a response to Tim questioning his use
of moral judgements just to introduce your own moral judgement?

If you want to issue moral pronouncements ex cathedra, why not just start
