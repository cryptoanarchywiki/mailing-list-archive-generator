Tim, You have a very good point about what goes on in this thread. I wasnt
speaking about you yelling at me.. some of the members decided to write me
'personal' memos..one idiot being 'AOL SUCKS KILL ALL AOL SUCKS' or some
stupid idiotic undereducated statement like that. Thanks for the response
though..it was appreciated. :)
Adam
