Given that FTS2000 supports X.25 Packet Assembly Disassembly (PADs), there
is a wide field ahead for screwing up such useful features as 8-bit
transparent characters and data forwarding (i.e. When does the PAD decide
it has a complete packet and actually send it).  Try running emacs without
good data forwarding control.
