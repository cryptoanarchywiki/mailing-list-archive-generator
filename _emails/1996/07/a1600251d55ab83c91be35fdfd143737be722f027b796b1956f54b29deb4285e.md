I don't think so.  None of the FPGAs Ian & I looked at could even approach
the RC4-cracking performance of a fast Intel CPU.

Those estimates assume that a single FPGA can break RC4 in hours.  I think
that is an extremely optimistic assumption, given the available public
information.  But perhaps NSA is orders of magnitude ahead of us in chip
design (unlikely) or orders of magnitude ahead of us in RC4 cryptanalysis
(and we're back to paranoid musings).

Naw, this is orthogonal to the cost of cryptanalysis-- even when all messages
are sent in the clear, they still need this storage.

I would be willing to believe that message selection & storage is a very
expensive part of SIGINT.  However, if one has the resources to break all
encrypted messages in realtime, I don't see why message selection & storage
costs need to increase so significantly.

Nope, I don't buy it.  Show me a chip takes longer to load a known plaintext
and ciphertext pair than it takes to do a 40-bit exhaustive keysearch for that
pair, and I'll show you a chip that has no I/O pins. :-)

Remember, if you have a million FPGAs to crack a thousand messages, you don't
have to send the first message to all million FPGAs, then send the second
message to all million FPGAs, etc.  Instead you should send the first message
to the first thousand FPGAs, and concurrently send the second message to the
second thousand FPGAs, etc.

I agree that key schedule complexity can have a significant influence on the
complexity of exhaustive keysearch.

However, DES's key schedule is actually much better suited to exhaustive
keysearch than RC4's key schedule is.  (I speak with implementation experience.
However, it's not too hard to see why this should be true-- DES was designed
for implementation in hardware, and its keyschedule consists merely of some
bit permutations, which are free in hardware.  RC4 uses RAM heavily, and thus
can incur large I/O costs, and also is highly serialized, so it is not so
well-suited to efficient hardware implementation.)

Yup, brute-forcing 40-bit Blowfish will probably be even harder than RC4.

No, FPGAs are programmable logic, and thus can be easily reprogrammed if the
Netscape default encryption algorithm changes.  Perhaps you are thinking of
ASICs, which have their logic burned in, and cannot be changed.
