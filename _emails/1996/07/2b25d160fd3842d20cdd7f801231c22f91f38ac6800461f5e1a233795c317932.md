Examples of this are the bombing attacks on tourists in Egypt
and Turkey; classical terrorism where the victims are not really
participants in the political struggle (as opposed to volontarily
enlisted American soldiers in Saudi). The agenda here is to bring
down the economy by scaring away future tourists, making way for
an islamic revolution/a separate kurdish state.

Anyone been to Egypt lately?
