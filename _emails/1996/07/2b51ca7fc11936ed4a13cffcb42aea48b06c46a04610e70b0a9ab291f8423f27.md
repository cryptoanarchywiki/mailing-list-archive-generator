800 (And 888/900 etc.) numbers use a different mechanism (ANI) than caller
ID to provide your telephone number to the person you are calling.  This
has been around far longer than caller ID, and really doesn't have all that
much to do with the caller ID service, which is entirely different.

So in essence, nothing's really changed with regard to 800 numbers, except
that people are now becoming _aware_ that the called party has access to
their telephone number.

If you want additional information, I'd recommend starting with the FAQ
for the alt.2600 newsgroup.
