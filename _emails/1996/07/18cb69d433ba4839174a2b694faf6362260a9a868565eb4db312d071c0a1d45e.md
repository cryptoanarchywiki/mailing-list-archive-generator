OK...A question for you all:

  If it is illegal (by our governments standards...) to export programs
like PGP, etc., and you can send the whole source code in a message 
because that is also considered illegal, then could you send the code,
broken up into many pieces, and send THAT in Email, would that be 
illegal?

  (Wow...All in one sentence... :)
