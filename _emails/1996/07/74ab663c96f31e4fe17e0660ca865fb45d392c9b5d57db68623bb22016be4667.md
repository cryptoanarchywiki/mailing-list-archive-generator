I've been working on a project in secret for a few months, and now am
talking about it with everyone so that we can all help it along.

Want all the Internet traffic between you and every other
privacy-conscious site on the net to automatically be encrypted using
Triple-DES, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman?  Without changing your hardware
or software, except to stick a Linux PC on your network, or install a
new version of Linux on your laptop?  Want it all by Christmas?  Then
check out
