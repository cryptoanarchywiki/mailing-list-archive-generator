After all these figure of speech comparisons of federal agents with 'ninja's' I think it's noteworthy, that the ninja's of old were a counterculture themselves.
In fact, they were despised by the ruling class (government) of the samurai as low-lifes and scum of the earth, because the ninjas families would not subdue themselves to 'codes of honor' like the samurai and also practiced different religions (Buddhism) 
The samurai in turn tried to eliminate the ninja's by outlawing the use of weapons, repressing religious freedom and even invading the ninja's 'heartland' of the province of IGA.
Nevertheless, the subsequent elimination of rights for ninja's led to the opposite effect, the ruling samurai had hoped for: instead of being turned into defenseless kids, the ninja's were now free from any boundaries in terms of existing norms and were
thus much more innovative and efficient than the samurai and their 'code of honor'. That enabled the ninja's eventually to survive all onslaughts and dangers to their culture until today.
OBCrypto: They also used various cryptographic methods and systems to transport messages.
