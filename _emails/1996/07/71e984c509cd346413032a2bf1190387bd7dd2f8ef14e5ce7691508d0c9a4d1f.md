My opinions are just that, MINE but here's a question ..

In the event that drugs are legalized like alcohol ( also a drug
) and tobacco and cafeine, who will take responsibility for
housing and feeding those, who are now blameless, individuals
who can't or won't take responsibility for themselves and work
or whatever. With freedom and liberty come a lot of
responsibility. Too many people today balme every damn thing in
the world for their problems -  and get away with it....

1. My grear grand parents were slaves, I suffer because of that,
so I killed 30 White people.

2. My momma didn't give me no tit so I raped those women and
killed them

and on, and on...............
