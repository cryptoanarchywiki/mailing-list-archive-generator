One problem, however, would be how to keep the "decoy" data, accessible
with only the ambush key, "fresh" in that it must undergo a certain amount
of
turbulence to appear real.  The two file systems would essentially have to
mirror each other, one with the juicy bits and one with the decoy bits.
It would seem to be practically impossible to just build two file systems
as one would 'disappear' when only the ambush key was used.  Wouldn't it
be sort of obvious that something was wrong if half the disk vanished?

It's not odd at all.  That account is, indeed, on the NSA's unclassified
system.  In my work, I sometimes support vendors taking products through
the NCSC evaluation cycle.  The dockmaster box is the place where the EPL
records and other vendor materials are exchanged and/or published.
Dockmaster accounts are available for anyone who works in the INFOSEC
field, including private individuals.  Quite honestly, it's of little use
(the OS sucks) unless you need up to the minute EPL and/or common criteria
stuff, etc.
