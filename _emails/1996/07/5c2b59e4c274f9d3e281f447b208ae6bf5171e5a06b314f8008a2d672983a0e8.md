Thats plain HCI statistic crap, DONT YOU BELIVE IT, those numbers are based
on drug dealers killing other drug dealers.. read the real FBI numbers,
they are on the net.

Anyways the real reason that the "more likely" argument bothers me  is that
its like saying that Crypto is more likely to be used by criminals than law
abiding citzens.
