RAF does not work in this area.  If any of you are interested (I have no 
idea what this is about), please feel free to say I suggested you contact 
her.

dave, someone called me with a request last week for people who have a 
good background in internet security, "firewalls" and encryption etc.  I 
thought Jim Bennett and perhaps some of your other contacts would work.

Could you e-mail Jim's phone and e-mail to

Sandra Huie (Jonathon's wife) at shuie@masterteam.com

Thanks, JP
