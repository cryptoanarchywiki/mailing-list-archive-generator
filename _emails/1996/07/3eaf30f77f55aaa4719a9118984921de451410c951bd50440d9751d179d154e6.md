I don't know why you're quoting your own licensing agreement to me.  When I 
said, "you need no permission to provide these products," by "you" I was 
referring to your company, Netscape.  As in, you don't need the NSA's 
permission to write and sell good crypto domestically, even if (arguably) 
they can limit export.
