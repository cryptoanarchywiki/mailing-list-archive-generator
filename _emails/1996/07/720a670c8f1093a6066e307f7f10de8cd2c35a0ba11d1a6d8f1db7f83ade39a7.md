Duane says:

> science and technology and especially their long term ramifications. I am
> completing my Master's Degree thesis as well as working full time at the
> University of Massachusetts at Amherst. I have some part time work
> maintaining Web pages and I have been involved with the Idea Futures Web

> I will introduce the concept of Idea Futures which is a market in which

> those who can accurately forecast future outcomes. It has been recognized

This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held on
Tuesday, August 6, 1996 from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of the
Harvard Club of Boston, One Federal Street. The price for lunch is $27.50.
This price includes lunch, room rental, and the speaker's lunch. ;-).  The
Harvard Club *does* have dress code: jackets and ties for men, and
"appropriate business attire" for women.

We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or if we *really* know
you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by
Saturday, August 3, or you won't be on the list for lunch.  Checks
payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will have to be sent
back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The Harvard
Club of Boston".

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've had
to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for instance), please
let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something out.

Planned speakers for the following few months are:

 September   Tatsuo Tanaka    Some Economics of Digital Cash
 October     Philippe LeRoux  Stock Exchanges and the Web

We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on the
first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a presentation to the
Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program Commmittee, care of Robert
Hettinga, rah@shipwright.com .
