So now you're switching your ground to the First Amendment? Why can't you
argue straight out?

Slip of the editor, not a conspiracy. THe point is that it says "not
delegated to the United States", and as I showed below, powers which cover
ITAR were so delegated.

This is an unsustainable position for which you have no legal basis. Your
implied claim is that an amendment implicitly repeals prior language. As
we've seen from other amendments, if prior language is to be repealed that
is done explicitly or by reference in the amendment. There are some Supreme
Court cases because there are conflicts between the implicit content of
some amendments (the famous "penumbra of the Constitution") and prior
language. And we've seen many cases where even strict constructionists held
in Dicta that prior powers weren't implicitly repealed by the First,
particularly in speech cases. The famous "Freedom of Speech does not extent
to the right to falsely shout "Fire!" in a crowded theatre" is one. "The
Constitution is not a suicide pact." is another.

But Con Law is a bit off topic for this group, eh? Let's agree to disagree.

>Believe me, David, I don't think I could teach you anything.

That's both false and defamatory unless you're commenting on your own
shortcomings as a teacher. Some here will tell you that they've taught me a
lot, and that when evidence or logic are clear, I do alter my views. In the
instant case neither appertains, at least not so far.

Best;
David
