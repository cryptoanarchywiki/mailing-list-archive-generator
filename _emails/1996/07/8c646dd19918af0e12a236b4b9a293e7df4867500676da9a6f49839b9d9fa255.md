No need to have all the code in memory, I think you ought to be able
to keep the code in an overlay, or something of that nature.

I take your point about memory consumption under DOS, though
presumably it would be possible these days to load data high.  I think
SFS supports this for instance.

Only the secret key algorithms, 80x86 code would be the highest
priority coz they're the slowest (well the old ones are).  You're
going to need very OS specific code for the low level parts of the
file system anyway.

One of the requirements some earlier posters gave was that they would
like to be able to accesss the same data with different OSes (the
example was to access the same partition with linux,win95, and winNT).
Double space isn't available for unix.  (There was a read-only version
for linux, but this seems to be currently unmaintained.)

So one reason to include a compression module would be for portability
of data.

I agree with your points about separating concerns and keeping crypto
and compression reasonably separate to keep bugs in compression code
having the potential to affect crypto code.  It would probably be
prudent to use OS segment protection, and page locking to protect
crypto code and data from being accidentally overwritten, and written
to swap respectively.

Hmm, say that you were using MDC with md5 as the hash (before
Dobertin's recent pronouncements, naturally no one would do this now),
if Dobertin comes through with the general case you might wish you had
combined it with 3DES...

For the paranoid only, but a nice option I think,

Encrypted filesystems are for hiding data from other parties.  If your
threat model includes law enforcement such a feature would be most
useful.  You would have data which you would not mind agents
obtaining, and have the "real" data hidden in a second file system.

When you are supeonaed for your key, you reveal the 1st file systems
key.  That key does not reveal anything about the 2nd partition, not
even it's existance.

The second file system would be hidden in the blocks not used with the
1st file system.  To access the 2nd file system you would need to tell
the file system driver the keys for both file systems -- the 1st key
so that it could find which were the unused blocks in the 1st file
system, the 2nd key for access to the hidden file system.

Yes, that's the idea -- your 1st key has been supeoned is the threat
model.

Indeed you would.  So?

Nah, you'd buy some video editing equipment, perhaps a photo-CD
recorder, start a business doing photo-retouching (I know someone who
does this btw, they use DAT tapes just to shift the Gbs they get
through), video editing, whatever.  All quite plausible.
