Stefan Brands has a protocol that probably does what you want.  And also
would form the basis for anonymous internet "postage stamps"...

It is unpublished, but he kindly allowed to me describe it in a paper I
wrote that discussed whether a bank would ever want to take the risk of
allowing bank accounts where it did not know the identity of the customer.

The protocol is described at 

http://www.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/articles/oceanno.htm#ENDNOTE286

[A frames version of the same paper is at 

http://www.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/articles/ocean.htm

but it's harder to jump straight to the footnote you want in that version]
