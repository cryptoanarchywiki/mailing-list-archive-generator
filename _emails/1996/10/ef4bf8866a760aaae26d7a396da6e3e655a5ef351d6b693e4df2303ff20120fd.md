Whoa!  Unless the service contracted for includes the use of the
contractors' computers, what business does the employer have poking
around in someone else's computer?  I can easily see Big Brother
demanding exactly that, but He won't hire me under those conditions.

Or was that just a slip of the mind, assuming large organizations
should have greater powers than smaller ones?  I do that too much
myself.
