I was actually working on a message saying something similar, under the 
working title of "Trusted First Parties". 

The idea is to generate a separate key pair to be used for recovery
purposes, and then place the private key in a trusted, off-line location
(much easier to arrange than if the key is to be kept on-line). 

The key should probably be encrypted using a symmetric algorithm keyed of
a pass phrase, but since the pass phrase will only ever be used once, it's
the kind of thing that might end up being forgotten, especially in those
'what's that tree doing in the middle of my machine room?' key recovery 
moments.

Because the  TFP key is protected other keys, the key length should be 
such as to give a work factor equal or greater than that needed to force 
the keys that will be protected by it. 

TFP can be used to weaken forward secrecy by encrypting the ephemeral
session key under the TFP key and sending it with the message stream. You 
don't have real forward secrecy, because  if the TFP key is cracked,all 
prior session keys will be exposed; however this setup is still somewhat 
better than straight RSA key exchanges using your regular key, as the 
private TFP key is less exposed.
