With a very large number of ecash users, perhaps. Otherwise, you can 
kinda figure out which kid raided the cookie jar - he's the one with 
chocolate chips smeared all over his face.

Also - in order to communicate back to the perpetrator, the victim needs
to communicate to the first step in the chain. The operator of that chain
should not be held responisble for the system being used for criminal
activity IF they are unaware of such activity. However, if they are
informed that the perpetrator is forcing the victim to communicate through
their system, they are no longer unaware - privacy is one thing, aiding 
and abetting a crime is another. What's to keep the authorities from 
following the trail of crubs back to the perpetrator, other than the 
usual threats of "don't call the cops" and "you have 24 hours to respond?"
A few hops through some generally uncooperative jurisdictions might do, 
but perhaps El Dictator of Little Bannana Republic might just decide to 
hold the perpetrator's "payment" hostage ...

Sounds like the making of a good movie script. Can we get Tom Cruise and 
one of those Thinking Machines laptops??  ;)
