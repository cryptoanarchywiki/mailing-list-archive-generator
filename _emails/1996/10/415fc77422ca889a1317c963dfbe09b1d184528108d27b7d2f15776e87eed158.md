This reminds me...   Years ago, somebody developed a technique called "Voice 
Stress Analysis," which was supposed to detect small variations in a 
person's voice in response to stress.  Not exactly a lie-detector, but it 
was supposed to do nearly the same thing.   Does anybody plan to analyze the 
debates for stress?  Is there software to do this?  (Tried to do a 
web-search; didn't see anything.)
