Assuming that this was I troll, I took this to private mail.  Since
there is some relevance to computer security and anonymity I am
forwarding it back to the list.  Here is my reply to him:

Well, you posted to a mailling list about cryptography and asked a
silly question about IP spoofing.  Smells like a troll.  Apparently
others thought so too; I guess I was the only one silly enough to
respond.

"...what forged mail..."
Well, your whole post was about forging the sender...


Now, to answer your question:

In order to do a successful IP spoofing, you must either gain access 
to the routing mechanism for one or more non-local IP addresses, or
spoof a DNS (Domain Name System) server.  To send packets with a
forged IP address generally requires substantial ability to modify
the behavior of the local TCP stack.  Since Win95 does not provide
such functionality via the winsock.dll interface, and the source
code to the tcpip module is not available, in order to use Win95 for
such purposes would necessitate rewriting and replacing a
substantial portion of the IP-networking code.  Since you expressed
no interest in doing so, I assumed you were joking when you said
that you wanted to use Win95.  On operating systems which provide an
interface for the user to insert raw packets into the local tcp/ip
stack, ip spoofing is much more practical.  Please see the post I
made to the list about a month ago on the subject of IP Tunneling.
I included two scripts, written under the Linux Operating System,
which serve to give you a non-local IP address (using ssh as the
tunneling transport mechanism).  I assume that this would be
sufficient for the purpose you intend.  You will, however, need to
find a cooperative network administrator from whom to borrow an IP
address.

The other option is DNS spoofing.  The simplest form of this is to
only forge the reverse-dns lookup.  This requires access to the
reverse-dns server, or merely suffient information about it to forge
packets from it.  (eg information obtained using a packet sniffer on
the local ethernet)  This method is fairly widely known and
practiced.  For this reason, most servers now check the reverse-dns
against a forward-lookup, so you are unlikely to succeed at doing
this.  It might also be possible to engage in a denial-of-service
attack (such as a packet flood) in order to prevent the reverse-dns
lookup.  This is, however, of limited utility since the IRC server,
if it accepts a connection without a reverse-dns entry, would
publicly display the numeric address, which anyone could then
independently look up, or do a traceroute on.

I hope this answers your questions about IP spoofing.  In the future,
please try to familiarize yourself with the ongoing list discussions,
as this will encourage people to take your questions more seriously.
