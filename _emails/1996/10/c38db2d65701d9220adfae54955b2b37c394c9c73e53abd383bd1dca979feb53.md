That's Declan's department (and other non-clueless journalists - declan is
just the most visible).   If it get's widespread and the target is something
like Digicash, it'd get picked up by the Crime/Snoozeweek crowd.

Judging by the people on the list, about 50%.... <g>

Depends on the type of failure - ranging from dreadful to minor.

A Linux port (Pentium) would be *very* good - lots of Linux people tend to by
pro-cpunk.  Ditto for OS/2.   And who knows, if you hyped the business
aspects enough you might even find IBM or some other large corp willing to
donate some time on large system.

>5. What's a good target? Ideally, we need a plaintext/ciphertext pair,

ecash, ecash, ecash!    Given all the attention anything that 'will give your
VISA number to evil hackers' gets, this is an important target.  It's serious
and newsworthy.

>6. What other incentives can be used to recruit machines?

Maybe give away a Pentium to the person who finds it? (Assuming donations
from list members, of course)
