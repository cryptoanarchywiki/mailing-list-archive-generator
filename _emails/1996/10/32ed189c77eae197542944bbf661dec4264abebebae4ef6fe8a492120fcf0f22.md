Indeed, not all Microserfs are millionaires. Accessing the URL,
http://microsoft.com/list_of_millionaires, I find that as of the close of
business yesterday, there were 13 non-millionaires at Microsoft. Seven were
part-time janitors, three were in food service, and the remaining three had
no identifiable jobs. (And two of the janitors are expected to become
millionaires any day now.)

And http://microsoft.com/list_of_billionaires reports three on the list.

Glad to be of help.
