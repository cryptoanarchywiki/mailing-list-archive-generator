While I have worked through essentially none of the details, if the system 
can be implemented well enough, all this kind of information will be blinded 
into oblivion.  Donations won't be tallied individually, and news of their 
arrival will be disguised, possibly by limiting the size that is credited to 
the candidate per day and thus in effect splitting up a donation to make it 
"arrive" over a period of a week or two.  Only overall totals will be 
reported, possibly rounded to only two significant figures, and even then 
possibly only on a weekly basis.

Try again.  Rather than trying to prove that a system won't work, why not 
help develop one that will?

But "vote delivery" can't be proven, or even demonstrated with a strong 
degree of assurance.

I'd LOVE to "get rid of the career politician."  And every other kind of 
politician, as well!

What I consider wrong is that government affects way too large a fraction of 
our lives, without apparent Constitutional justification.  If the government 
at all levels were only, say, 1/10th of its current size, there would be 
much less motivation for corruption.
