The Oregon DMV database will once again be searchable on the web, in
a few days, at http://www.notek.com/or-dmv.  Suggestions on what
sorts of privacy-related propaganda should be on the page are welcome
(and encouraged: currently there's really nothing there...)  Also, 
looking for a volunteer to write a quick press release we can
send to Oregon media, regarding the reasons behind the page, etc. (I
suck at such things, and would prefer if someone else with a talent
for writing on cypherpunk-type topics would do it.)

A few details, for those who want to know:  the actual databases are 
stored on a 486DX/33 (the only machine I could spare for the task..)
running linux 2.0.13 with 8 megs o' RAM.  The search isn't quite as
speedy as Genocide2600's (the previous home of the Web-Searchable dmv 
database), but it's reasonably fast.  The license database is indexed 
on last name, the plates database is currently indexed on plate number, 
but when I can find more harddrive space, it will also be indexed (and 
thus searchable) by last name, which is a bit of an expansion on Genocide
2600.

Anyway, all that's really left is a few hours of work tidying up 
the cgi/database server code and finishing the actual web page, 
which I should get to tomorrow or possibly the next day.  I'll post
a notice when the page is officially up, but in the meantime, please
let me know what type of privacy propaganda/tools/info (if any) would be 
appropriate.  Thanks...
