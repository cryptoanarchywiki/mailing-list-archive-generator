No doubt.

The banks offering these pre-paid 'credit', really debit, cards are already
offering such an instrument.  Although I've got my hands full at the
moment, I've been asked by several money sources to investigate some
unconventional, but legal, instrument services.  Seems, as you say, you
only have to guarantee the holder that they and establish and transact
business with relatively good anonymity.

I'm not making any promises, but I have some banking experience (6 years at
Citicorp) developing financial products, ATM, wireless and transaction
crypto.  The most difficult part, besides the marketing, would be getting a
MC/VISA franchise under acceptable contractual terms.  I've never done this
sort of thing.  Seems you wouldn't need to pitch this to MC/VISA any
different than many of the other similar 'debit' cards.  Unless their
contracts specifically contain a 'know you payee' provision (required for
checking and savings, which are Fed insured, and money transmitters), it
shouldn't be a problem.
