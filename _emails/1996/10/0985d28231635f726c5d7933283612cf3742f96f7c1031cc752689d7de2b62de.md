Yes, if he were just to modular add the key to the plaintext (or XOR 
them) he would have an OTP if AND ONLY IF the key were real random, 
however, he doesn`t do this, he uses the key to seed an array or 
linear congruential generators, which have been cryptanalysed to hell 
and back.

Basically, ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS dismiss anyone trying to sell an 
OTP, they are totally impractical, he`s just using technobabble to 
get around the fact that his system is actually a stream cipher and 
is of no value because it has been broken within days of being 
announced.
