No, this is not true of a good PRNG

Good PRNGs are as likely to produce these key values as anything 
else. the reason random looking patterns occur more often is because 
there are more of them.

The fact is a PRNG may *LOOK* predictable, ie. 111000111000 but the 
next bit will have an equal probability of being a 0 as a 1.

None whatsoever.
