Bay Area Cypherpunks,

I am hereby pledging US$100 towards a fund to fly Dimitri to the
SF Bay area for a Cypherpunk meeting.  I certainly would like to
meet a real cryptographer, and I'm sure many of you would too.
We should throw in a hotel room and local transportation as well.  
I want Dimitri to be our featured speaker--his choice of topic, 
of course.

I am ABSOLUTELY serious in this offer, but I will need donations
from other Cypherpunks.  If I get sufficient pledges to cover 
Dimitri's travel expenses, I will coordinate with Dimitri and
make the necessary travel and hotel arrangements.

Dimitri, what say you?  Are you willing in flying to California 
to address the Mother of All Cypherpunk Meetings?  I hope so.
I'm sure it would be one of our most highly attended meetings.


 S a n d y
