Timmy May continues to post nonsensical praises in his name using
an anonymous remailer....

Timmy May is an ignorant coward. He's got nothing better to do,
so he starts up flame wars on this mailing list. He can't contribute
anything crypto-relevant because he knows nothing about cryptography.

This is a lie. Anyone who's been subscribed to this mailing list for
a while knows that Timmy May posts to most personal attacks (inlcuiding
attacks on his many enemies' religion and ethnicity), lies, fabricated
quotes, flame bait, and overall noise.
