I think you would also be able to use Procmail and Formail (two UNIX mail 
processing programs) to set up a quick and dirty remailer.  

Procmail could be set to look at the headers of a message for something 
like a header of "Remail-To:", or [REMAIL] in the Subject: header.  If it 
finds this, it would use Formail to replace the headers with generic 
information, put the specified address into the To: field, and send the 
message on its way.  I don't really know if you'd be able to set this up 
for chaining remailers or not though.

If you need to know how to set up a mail filter or defend against 
emailbombs, send me a message with the words "get helpfile" (without the 
" marks) in the SUBJECT: header.  I have several useful FAQ's and documents 
available.
