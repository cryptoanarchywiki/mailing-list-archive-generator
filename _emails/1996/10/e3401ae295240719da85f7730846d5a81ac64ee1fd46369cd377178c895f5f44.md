While I realize that religious arguments, in the large sense, are a 
well-honed skill of many of the participants of this list, the current 
threads concerning the LDS/Mormon church are so far off-topic that
it isn't funny, just annoying.

PLEASE take this stuff to private mail. Most of us have little or no
interest in it, and it's creating entirely unnecessary discord and 
hatred (not to mention using up bandwidth).

Unless a group takes a stand on encryption, lets keep them out of
it.

Please!
