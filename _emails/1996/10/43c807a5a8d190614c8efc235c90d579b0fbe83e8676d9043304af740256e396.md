Disagree strongly.  The islands are very conscious of their image
particularly when it comes to organized crime and drugs.  EUB not exist in
its present form or anything like it.  The U.S. still has strings to pull
in that area.  Avoid the islands for these reasons.

The U.S. is getting to clever at this to just shoot at the front end.
Gorelick and friends will see to that.

A rather large speedbump.

The United States is full of thugs with guns, but they do tend to have
problems getting involved where there is not even the vaguest hint or
jurisdiction.  EUB solved that problem for the US quite effectively.

I disagree, but time will tell.
