PGP works on files, not disks, and it's been talked about here pretty often :-)
The Secure Drive and Secure Device programs (secdrv and secdev) 
do disk encryption.  Some of the commercial products use single-DES,
so they're marginally useful if they don't implement things carelessly,
some use "Our really fast proprietary encryption" and are thus worthless.
Others just try to encrypt the FAT or other headers and therefore don't
stop Bad Guys from grepping through your disk for real data.
Your Macintosh mileage may vary.  For Unix-like systems there's CFS, Matt
Blaze's
Crypto File System.

Don't bother.  The KOH folks once talked about using virus techniques to spread
encryption that was good for you, and can therefore be presumed to be
terminally clueless.  If your description of KOH's disk encryption
strategy is correct, it's not really useful against professionals.

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
  and the politicians had to count them all.
