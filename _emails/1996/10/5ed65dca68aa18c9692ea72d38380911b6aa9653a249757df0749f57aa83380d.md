For the last time I react on these (political) issues, and then I will gladly 
return to business. Our views should be clear by now.

I don't agree.

I am not suggesting anything of the kind.

I suggested we had a difference of opinion, and I can very well live 
with that. It's a matter for you to decide in the States, and for us 
to decide in the Netherlands/Europe. My only concern is that measures 
we take are compatible with foreign measures (mark compatible, not 
the same), and that the US is not pushing foreign states into measures 
they don't really want to take.

I suggest you try and read what people write first, instead of skimming 
through a message and jumping to conclusions.
