While the message blew by a little while ago (and I didn't save it),
someone had posted a URL with information about Dimitri's sordid/alleged
past on the Net.  At roughly the same time, I ran across (by accident) a
URL that lists Dimitri as a "net.legend" and offers yet another
perspective.  Apparently, Dimitri is far more well known that any of us
(at least me) gave him credit for.  The notion that the idiom "dandruff
covered" is indicative of anti-semitism is one passage that I found rather
amusing.
