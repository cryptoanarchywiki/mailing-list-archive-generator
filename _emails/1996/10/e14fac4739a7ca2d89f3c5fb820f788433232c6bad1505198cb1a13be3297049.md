HP, then, might be a good company to approach as a potential donor on a 
DES-cracker.   While they want to be able to portray their products as 
reasonably secure, at the same time they want to be able to de-fuse any 
export limits.  Showing that, say, $25,000 of hardware could crack DES in a 
year (and thus, presumably, $25 million could crack DES in 1/3 of a day, a 
budget available to the NSA et al.) would demonstrate that there's no strong 
reason to keep it restricted in any way.
