Hi cypherpunks,

   It has come to my attention that there may be problems sending mail
from the anonymous remailers to AOL accounts. I'd like a volunteer with
an AOL address to recieve a test messages sent by me, and report back to
me which mails got through and which didn't.

   Thanks very much in advance.

Raph Levien
