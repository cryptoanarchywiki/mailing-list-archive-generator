I'm totally nonplused.  Does anyone on the list have any idea 
what Dimitri is talking about?  Has he posted a RESPONSIVE answer
to my invitation?  If so, I never saw it.  

Does anyone have any idea why Dimitri uses the term "threat"?  I 
have not threatened Dimitri and I have indicated that as my guest 
he will be under the mantle of my protection.  He'll be safer here 
than he is in his own bed.

Assuming /arguendo/ that such threats have been made, I hereby
request that anyone making such threats desist.  I further pledge
that I will personally hire a lawyer to defend Dimitri if any 
such suit is brought in California.  (If someone wants to sue
Dimitri in New York, now or later, that'll be his problem.)
