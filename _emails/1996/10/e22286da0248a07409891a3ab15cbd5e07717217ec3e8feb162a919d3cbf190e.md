If that were so, you could supply a proof, couldn't you?  Since you
can't, this "mathematical certainty" crap just proves you are a bozo.
Is this what you are trying to prove by sending all these messages,
that "some bozo really dislikes Tim May"?

Is there any substance to these attacks on Tim May?  Is there any
reason a disinterested reader of cypherpunks should distrust or
dislike Tim May?  What would you like us to conclude from these
seemingly false statements you keep making about him?

If Tim May really is a terrible person for some reason, why don't you
tell us why?  Are you not trying to get us to dislike Tim May?  Are
you just trying to drive people away from the cypherpunks mailing
list?  Would you be satisfied if everyone unsubscribed?  If Tim May
unsubscribed?

What exactly are you trying to accomplish?
