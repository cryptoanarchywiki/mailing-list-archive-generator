The airlines don't yet carefully check IDs (no SSN or DL # retained).  They
merely check that the name on your ID matches the reservation.

Are SSN and other ID required when opening a 'pre-paid' credit card
account?  That is, the ones for persons with poor credit who are required
to maintain a balance sufficient to pay off the charges?  Perhaps we could
put our heads together and determine a way to become franchised by MC/VISA
and offer 'affinity' type accounts with no address requirements (all
statments are sent via remailer/nym email).
