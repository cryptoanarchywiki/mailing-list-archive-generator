How do you know that it's him?

Lesse now, you must be projecting. After all, you were invited to speak 
in San Fran, you declined backing out as only a coward would, not 
outright "No" but rather "When I have the time" and refused to plan this 
ahead, even months ahead.  Yet, you seem to have plenty of time to flame 
here, so you really have lots of free time - to flame and be cowardly.  
And your ignorance is legendary around here.  You ignore netiquette and 
flame and cause flame wars and spam.

So what do you contribute other than copyrighted news postings and huge 
flames, and do so without the author's permission? Or do you have their 
written permission?

I have been on this list since 1992 and can attest to the fact that the 
above paragraph which you have written is false.  I have seen more personal 
attacks, flames, racial prejudice, and lies from you than from anyone 
else on here.  I guess you are of the belief that if you lie in every 
message about someone violently enough, eventually someone will believe 
your bullshit.

That someone isn't me Vulis.  An asshole is an assole, and you sir sure 
fart like one.  Get off this list.  Take your shit elsewhere, we don't 
want you here.  Be gone!
