Dimitri is certainly welcome to bring his video with him, but 
just sending the tape defeat the whole purpose of a physical 
meeting.  When we have speakers, there are opportunities to 
expand or contract one's talk to conform to the particular 
audience's interests.  A live presentation allows the listeners 
to ask for clarifications and to provide useful feedback to the 
speaker.

I am again extending my most sincere invitation to Dimitri to
come to San Francisco to address a Cypherpunk physical meeting.
What I need now is a simple "yes" or "no".  After that, I will
bend over backwards (but not forwards) to accomodate Dimitri's 
particular concerns.
