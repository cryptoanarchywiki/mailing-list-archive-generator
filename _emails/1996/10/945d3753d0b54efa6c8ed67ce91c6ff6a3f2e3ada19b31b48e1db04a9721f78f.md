Has anyone tried this to see whether the LOS would or wouldn't be acceptable?

On a related note:

I've been charged with developing an Internet service which needs to assure
its clients of anonymity.  However, we fear some clients may abuse the
service and we wish to prevent the abusers from re-enrollment if
terminated for misbehavior. (In your example, it would be the person(s)
trying to discover the service host via flood).

My thought was to base enrollment on some sort of 'blinding' of their
certified signature (e.g., from Verisign) which produces a unique result
for each signature but prevents the service from reconstructing the
signature itself (and thereby reveal the client's identity).  I'm calling
this negative authentication.

Have you come across anyone who has considered this problem or
another one which is mathematically very similar?

If the service could negatively authenticate users it would need such
limits and might not be subject to such attack.

I've never heard of the eternity service.  Where can I get more information?

BTW, would Eric Hughes' Universal Piracy System also solve such a
situation, by distributing or parking snippets of encrypted file data
across many 'cooperating' ftp (or whatever access/storage mechanism) sites.
Perhaps the negative authentication approach would help here too by
preventing flood/denial of service attacks against the 'key' sites.  If
only snippets of encrypted data are stored on any one host it might make
the SPA's goal even more elusive legally.
