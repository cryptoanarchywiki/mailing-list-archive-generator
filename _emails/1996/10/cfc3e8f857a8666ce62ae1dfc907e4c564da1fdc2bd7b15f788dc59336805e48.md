Clipper is dead.  It makes no sense for anyone to pay >$70 for a hardware
encryption device when many tools are available on the 'net for free.  AT&T
is manufacturing a clipper phone and there aren't any software products that I
know of that support Fortezza(?) cards.  The much larger danger is the recent
"key recovery" initiative.
