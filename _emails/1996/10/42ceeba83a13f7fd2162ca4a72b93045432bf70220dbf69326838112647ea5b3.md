What Mr. Bell probably means is that 'if the powers that be' decide 
to unilateraly change the rules, you are lost in limbo. The notion
that 'the powers that be' can be relied opun is seriously flawed,
for example take in account some of the dealings of our own guvment,
the abolishing of the WIR -overnight-, the proposals of Vermeent
that totally neglected art. 1 WvSr.

Basicly 'fraud' is a definition that benefits 'the powers that be',
one that seriously harms our rights and liberties. You also state
"If you want to play the game, play by its rules, otherwise don't 
play it." Well sometimes people have no other option then to play,
and dropping out if gouvernment changes the rules unilateraly can 
be to costly an option ..
