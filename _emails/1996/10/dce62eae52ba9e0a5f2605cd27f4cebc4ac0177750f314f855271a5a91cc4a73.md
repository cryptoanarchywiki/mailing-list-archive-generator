Before addressing the problems of crypto, how about addressing the 
problems of opaque envelopes in snail mail.

Opaque envelopes not only facilitate criminal conspiracies in the
same way that crypto does, it also makes possible such things as
letter bombs, which have no crypto equivalent.

The solution:   Mandatory tranparent envelopes.
