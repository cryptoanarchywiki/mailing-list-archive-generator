There was also an interesting comment made in session three of the 
Joint Australian/OECD Conference on Security, Privacy and Intellectual 
Property Protection in theGlobal Information Infrastructure,
(Canberra, 7 - 8 February 1996), reportedly by a representative of 
the DSD:

"... PGP may not survive as a viable option for private security."
