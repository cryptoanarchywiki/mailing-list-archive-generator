   U.S. Attorney Gen. Janet Reno offered to "set the record
   straight" at FCBA lunch Thurs. on why controversial
   issues of encryption and digital wiretapping "deserve
   support" of communications industry. She said law
   enforcement community agrees that encryption is
   "critical" to citizens who want to protect sensitive data
   but "our ability to protect life and property is
   threatened" if people use encryption that can't be
   accessed by law enforcement officials: "The only solution
   is encryption that allows data recovery." She said it's
   "important to understand" that digital wiretapping
   "doesn't expand the government's ability to conduct
   electronic surveillance."
