An acquaintence of mine works at a firm with little cryptography
experience. They are thinking of including cryptography in a 
future product, and Elementrix's Power One Time Pad is a
serious contestant.

I'm looking for independent critiques of the system, something
better than 'it's not really a one-time pad.' Is the cryptosystem
which is actually implemented worth a damn? Does their claim
to have solved the key distribution problem hold water? I
seem to remember something about them wanting to
generate keys for you, and ship them to the customer. Is this
correct?
