	An interesting idea, but how are you going to exchange
fingerprints? As far as I can see, the only tangible effect that this
scheme would have is to accelerate the call for detailed biometric
data (perhaps retinal scans or even DNA profiles) as proof of
identity.

	I'm not sure that we'd want to encourage that...
