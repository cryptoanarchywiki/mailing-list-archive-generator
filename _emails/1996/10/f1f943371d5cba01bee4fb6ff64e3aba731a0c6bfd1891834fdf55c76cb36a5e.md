Clearly curtains aid criminals.

One way of allowing private citizens to have privacy from their 
neighbors while still enabling legitimate government supervision
of citizen units would be to have microphones and observation
cameras in every home and shop that can be activated by the government
without the citizen units knowledge, thus allowing citizens full
curtain enabled privacy without interfering with legitmate government
security interests.

This will also help the government protect the citizen unit from 
exposure to dangerous and harmful thoughts and ideas.

Present efforts to inclulcate children with a correct outlook on life
are often frustrated by subversive, racist, or anti social teachings
at home.   This measure could help citizen units to ensure that their
speech is sensitive to the concerns of minorities and oppressed groups
and to current government views.

Since many shopkeepers already have such devices in their shop, there
is ample precedent for this system. 

A good start on such a system would be have the existing shop devices
run to the police instead of the shopkeeper.
