Oops - when I posted the previous announcement I gave the file the .html 
extension out of force of habit, the URL should in fact be 
http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut01/paper.txt (you can also get to it using
the previous URL, but your browser will wrap the text.  To fix this, either
load it as text or use the .txt URL).

Peter.
