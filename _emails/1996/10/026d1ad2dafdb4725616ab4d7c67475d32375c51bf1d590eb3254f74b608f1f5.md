I would tend to think that if you held on to the money long enough, you 
would
thwart them tracking it via linkage-especially once it becomes more 
commonplace
to do electronic transactions on the Net.  Actually, if you wait long 
enough, you
likely will  run the risk of there being a crackdown on nym servers, 
remailers, etc, and
maybe even specialy designed cancel-bots on usenet.
