   "U.S. to Ease Encryption Restriction." Page One lead. 
 
      Sources at IBM say scientists there have devised a 
      scheme that uses several steps to encrypt information 
      and the keys for unlocking it. Law enforcement officials 
      authorized to unscramble information would not get a key 
      for unlocking a message but instead the instructions for 
      how to break open a specific encrypted message.
