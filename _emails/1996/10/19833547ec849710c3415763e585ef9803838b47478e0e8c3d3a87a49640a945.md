Okay, correct me if I'm wrong on this (as if you wouldn't...):
1. Microsoft markets NT with C2 security
2. Numerous industry magazines report that you can bypass NTFS file security
by booting
    off of a diskette and using NTFSDOS.
3. Numerous industry magazines (and I believe MS finally mentioned it in some
routine status
     update) all say that NT should now be considered C2 *ONLY* on machines
w/o floppy 
     drives.

Sounds like they weren't quite honest on this one.  Or are you trying to say
that security-by-obscurity (relying on NTFS's then lack of external mounting
programs) was a good choice?

I know that you can get in there.  It just seemed odd that it would be setup
by default...
