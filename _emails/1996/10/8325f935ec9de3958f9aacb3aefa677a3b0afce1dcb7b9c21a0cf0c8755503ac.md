WASHINGTON - US First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton unveiled a new
Superman comic book for Bosnian children during an East Room ceremony
Monday. The comic book, written in three languages, shows the
mythical American hero flying down to save two little boys in Bosnia-
Herzegovina. The comic books will be distributed throughout the
country. With several Bosnian children standing nearby, Mrs. Clinton
pulled the drape on a blown-up reproduction of the cover of the comic
book. Mrs. Clinton said the initiatives show the United States'
"clear commitment to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina." She said
"Superman wlll bring a special message" to the Bosnian children.
