This is misstating things. Recall that it was the Digital Telephony Act,
passed only two years ago, which said that _phone switches_ had to be have
certain wiretap-friendly mods made, and authorized funding of up to $500
million to pay the phone companies for upgrades. design changes, etc.
(Arguably not enough money, arguably the money won't reach many companies,
and in any case the funding was delayed by Congress for a long time.)

The point being that not even a traditional phone company is in violation
of the law for not having wiretap-friendly designs! So your examples of
cellphones, etc., are beside the point.

We're discussing futures, not current illegalities.

The issue of ISPs falling under the DTA or not is, I think, a battleground
that is coming.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
