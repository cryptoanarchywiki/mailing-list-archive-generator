If anything, it would not be in their best _marketing_ interests to 
support GAK.  Rejecting GAK in favor of promoting strong crypto will 
make them look like "good guys".

This is also true of Micro$oft.  And contrary to an earlier opinion, 
I think Bill & Co. have been soured by their experiences with DoJ.  
While their are far larger motivations involve, I certainly don't 
think Micro$oft will skip at the chance to thumb their noses at the 
government if it's to their advantage.

Both of these companies may be willing to support a DES-crack effort
