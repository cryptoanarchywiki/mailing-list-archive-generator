	A: highly doubtful; B: what's that quote about Liberty and Security?
I'd comment on the increased searches that, from what I've seen, they'll do
no good whatsoever. I was searched on going through the Newark airport, and
had a _lot_ of hardback books in my suitcase... which the security drone
completely failed to riffle through to see if they were hollowed out with
explosives inside. Given the commonness of books as hiding places, this would
appear obvious... but what do you expect when people are selected for such
jobs by piss tests, "background checks" (e.g., not having any political
thoughts in their head other than pro-government ones), and Affirmative
Action?

>   Speaking at the bill-signing ceremony, Attorney General Janet Reno
>   called the legislation "another stage in our battle to secure our
>   people from the danger of terrorism."

	Unfortunately, her retirement due to Parkinson's won't help matters,
at least from how the current political situation looks.
   
>   Clinton made no mention of the provision in the bill that has upset
>   organized labor.

	At least there's that to say for the dammed bill.
   
>   Despite the flap over the Federal Express provision, the aviation
>   spending bill won Clinton's approval because of its central features:
>   authorizing $19 billion over two years for airport improvement,
>   maintenance and security.
   
>   The security provisions, such as requiring background checks of
>   baggage handlers, are among a host of new actions Clinton has pushed
>   to combat the threat of terrorism.

	Standard emotional politicking. I have every sympathy with the
victims, their families, and their friends (one of whom I know, from the
TWA 737 explosion)... but emotion isn't how to decide to pass laws.
   
>   The bill also authorizes the government to produce computer "profiles"
>   of passengers to track of travel patterns or other indicators that
>   raise suspicion of a security risk.
   
>   Flight lists also could be matched with lists of known terrorists
>   compiled by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Similar methods
>   have been used in drug interdiction efforts in recent years.
   
	I suspect my family won't be seeing me as much...
