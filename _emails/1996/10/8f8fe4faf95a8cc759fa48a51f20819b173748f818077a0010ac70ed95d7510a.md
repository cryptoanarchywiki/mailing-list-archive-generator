That's _my_ interpretation.  I look at it this way:  Missile launches can 

1.  Return to the country of origin.
2.  Splash down in International waters.
3.  land on foreign soil.
4.  Orbit for awhile and land "somewhere."
5.  Orbit essentially forever.
6.  Go somewhere in space other than an earth orbit.

All this stuff is obvious to the people who wrote the regulation. In 
addition, it is not necessarily certain which of these outcomes will occur 
in any given launch.   The terminology in the rule above does not 
distinguish any of these outcomes.  In the absense of further clarification, 
it is logical to conclude that which particular route the missile 
subsequently takes is irrelevant to the applicability of the exception.

This is particularly true, since the writers of that regulation were free to 
add clarification should they have chosen to do so.  Further, that they 
DIDN'T "clarify" is logical, because if the outcome of any given missile may 
be uncertain, and assuming that this regulation was written as a 
mutual-suck-up maneuver between government and industry, it is reasonable to 
assume that the regulation would be interpretated to immunize the launcher 
regardless of the launch's outcome.  One can reasonably suppose that 
Rockwell wouldn't want to be declared in violation of ITAR simply because 
the second stage of a rocket failed and dropped a crypto-carrying satellite 
onto China.
