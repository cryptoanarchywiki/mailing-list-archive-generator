Florida Supreme Court Home Page Adorned With Porn

TALLAHASSEE, Fla (Reuter) - A Florida court's Web page was restored Friday
after two days'
absence following a break-in by a hacker who placed pornographic images on
the site. 

Court officials Wednesday took the state court system home page off-line
after a computer hacker
apparently broke into the site and added pictures of nude men and women in
various stages of
sexual activity. 

The photos caused a stir among those who use the court page to access
Florida Supreme Court and
Appellate Court decisions. The home page is normally a little more staid,
with a plain wood-grained
background and hypertext links. 

Prurient, but disappointed, surfers looking for thrills on the net gave the
court system home page one
of its busiest days ever Friday. 

"We've had a significant number of hits today on our home page," said Craig
Waters, executive
assistant to Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Gerald Kogan. "With all the
publicity surrounding
this, a lot of people are curious." 

No files were tampered with and court records remained intact, Waters said.
The Florida
Department of Law Enforcement was contacted and was investigating the break in. 

Court officials intend to prosecute the perpetrator, Waters said.
