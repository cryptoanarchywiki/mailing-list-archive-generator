I doubt Tim May has posted this - he's done a fine job of staying out of 
this stupidity.

As I recall, he posted ONE piece of satire back in August. It was a 
humourous jest, and you do make yourself an easy target. You've been on 
him ever since, which proves that you can't take a joke at all. Your 
rants have been the longest running one-sided response to a troll that I 
have ever seen. Quit while you're behind.

Sandy has made you a generous offer to come out to the west coast,
expenses paid, and enlighten everyone with your knowledge of crypto.
You seem to find all manner of excuses to avoid the trip, and are using 
his offer as a further opportunity to insult the list.

Look in the mirror - attacks on religion, ethnicity, flame bait, NOISE ...

Fitting description of Dimitri, no?

Sandy - nice try at shutting up the kook, but you're just giving him the 
attention he craves at this point.

Not one person has spoken up publicly in defense of dlv; one person who 
has met him did speak on his behalf via private mail, but appears to have 
changed his mind. The points have been made. The best thing to do is drop 
dlv into the killfile, and ignore him.

I, diseased nocturnal marsupial, pledge to post no more crap to this list 
in response to, or regarding, one Dimitri Vulis, KOTM.

Take the pledge. Just say no.

-r.w.
