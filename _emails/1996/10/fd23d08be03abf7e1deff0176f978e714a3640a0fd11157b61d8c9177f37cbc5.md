Were I implementing this on my present system, with three hard disks (.5,
1.0, and 2.9 GB), I would just move the mail spool for the "no backups"
customers to one of the disks and then just not back it up. I realize this
could be a headache for ISPs, but the principle seems easy enough to
realize: move the mail files to a place that is not backed up.

(By the way, the backup utility I have is very easy to configure to back up
some files, not others, on all kinds of varying schedules. I would've
thought "tar" and other such vaunted Unix tools are at least as
configurable.)

Again, I think the most straightforward approach is to offer two kinds of
service: backups and no backups. And the "no backup" customers know that no
backups are kept. (BTW, it's also possible the ISP could offer a "crash
recovery" buffer of, say, a few days or a few weeks, to cover crashes of
its own system. The crash recovery disk would, ideally, be overwritten,
with no permanent copy of it ever made.
