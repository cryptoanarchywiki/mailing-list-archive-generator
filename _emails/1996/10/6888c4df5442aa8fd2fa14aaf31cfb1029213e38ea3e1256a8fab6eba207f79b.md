Just informally, how many of the people on this list do you think have
bypassed any cooperation with the USG on general principles and are using
International PGP?   ("Well this one uses non-banned math")

cpunks will use Underground Crypto.  What's missing is evidence that business
(and thus Joe Sixpack - either directly or indirectly) will.
