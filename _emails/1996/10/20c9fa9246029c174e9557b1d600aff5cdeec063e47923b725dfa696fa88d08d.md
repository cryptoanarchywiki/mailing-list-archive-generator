Pardon me for butting in.  Some remailer says I post too much, and I 
should cut out some. They didn't say which posts I should cut out, tho'.

Anyway, as I understand it, the current technology in voice/stress 
analysis goes way beyond the polygraph at its best (current) level of 
technology.  There was at least one agency that did voice analysis 
during the Simpson debacle, and the results were (as I recall) very 
promising.  Apparently, a person who can beat a polygraph cannot beat a 
voice/stress analysis.

BTW, the rule for these debates (as all presidential discourse) is:
"He's lying."
"How can you tell?"
"His lips are moving."
