The math heads are busy doing math, so I'll answer instead.

The probability goes 1:2^1...  1:2^2...   1:2^3...   1:2^4...

Two bits hold 4 possible values, 2 of which are bit-alike.  Three bits 
hold 8 possible values, 2 of which are bit-alike, of course.

1:2^(bits-1) is exactly what you would expect from a RANDOM sequence.  
This was also implied in the followups to your previous thread re: DES 
keyspace optimization.  Remember the Gambler's Fallacy...

Regards,
Doug
