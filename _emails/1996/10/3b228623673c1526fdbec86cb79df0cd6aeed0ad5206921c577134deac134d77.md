     Well, I guess that by the above paragraph, I am perfectly just in 
calling you a nearsighted fool?

     <BZZZZT> thanks for playing. Nearly _all_ chemicals can be manufactured
into poisons, not to mention explosives. You wanna register your bottle
of bleach with the feds? I can make a mustard gas clone out of it. You wanna
register your bag of sugar? There are explosives that can be made out of it.

     Hell, **OXYGEN** is toxic in high concentrations. You wanna track THAT?

     Life is %100 fatal. You can't change that.

> -tracking of all automobiles and deadly weapons

     Why? What percentage of murders are _solved_ because the police find 
the murder weapon, and use THAT to track it back to the killer? I'd bet that
it is an insignificant percentage (first person who points out a single case
gets the twit award--a free copy of GNU emacs source code mailed to your email
address--I KNOW it happens, but is it statistically common? No.) 

     And why track autos? Nosy little feds wanna know where I am?

     But by saying MEAN THINGS, you are hurting people, and that is wrong.

     Defending yourself isn't necessary, We, the government will do that 
for you.

     Tracking chemicals...

     1) Torture doesn't change someones mind. There are other means of 
doing that. 

     2) Very unimaginative.

     Or just make it unnecessary to carry out terrorist acts.

     You don't trust _any_ government, yet you want them to track _every_
chemical that people purchase? 

     There is crypto relevance in there somewhere I think...
