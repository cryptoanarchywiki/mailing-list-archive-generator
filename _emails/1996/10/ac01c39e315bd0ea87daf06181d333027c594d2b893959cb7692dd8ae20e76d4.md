Double plus agreed.

These are both possibilities.

Well, I believe that we are better off if the general perception
catches up with reality.

We need 50% success in one month to make it reasonably worthwhile.

I don't think we will fail :)

Other CPUs: MC68k, PowerPC, SPARC and Alpha versions, in roughly that
order.

Good question :)

An X screen saver would also be good. Lots of
Linux/FreeBSD/NetBSD/BSDI weenies in the world.
