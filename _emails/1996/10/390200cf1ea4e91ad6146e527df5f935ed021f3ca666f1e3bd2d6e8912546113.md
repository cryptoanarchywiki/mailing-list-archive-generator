No. In the scheme Law Enforcement (that is your LE, right?) agencies are never
handed over the private keys of Trusted Retrieval Parties (TRPs), only the session
keys. So for each sessionkey LEs will have to go to a TRP. Moreover, the choice
of TRPs should be large, so the idea is that you can always pick one you trust. Or
set up your own, for that matter...

In our scheme any third party, which is probably never a TRP, can check
equality of the sessionkeys send to the primary recipient (the TRP) and
the second recipient (the real adressee), i.e. *without* needing secret
information! In your suggestion checking can only be done with secret
information (you need the secret key of the primary recipient). Also,
"random padding" information of the second recipient is very secret as well, just 
compare the results Don Coppersmith presented on Eurocrypt97: if you
know the enough padding you know it all. So for instance sending
along the padding info along will make any key-escrow superflous (-;

As far as we are concerned, anybody - willing to follow regulating - can set
up his own TRP.

Who is they, governments as a whole? If you simplify discussions in this
way, I might as well say: "you guys only want to help criminals". I understand
your fears, but don't exaggerate.
