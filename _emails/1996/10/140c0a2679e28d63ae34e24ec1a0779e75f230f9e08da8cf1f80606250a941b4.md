1) "...the number of security problems inherent in SMTP are legendary"

Incorrect. SMTP is safe. 
Some (most?) implementations of SMTP have not been safe.
There is a big distinction between the protocol and its implementation.

2) "C2...now being applied to networked single-user systems over
   multiple windows (which may require different security levels)"

I'm not aware of anyone doing that - doesn't mean it's not happening -
just seems an unusual configuration.

Other than these nits seems a v. thoroughly researched paper.

In general you equare security with cryptography - which is fine - 
but there are other tools that you need to use in addition to cryptography
to secure a system and network.
