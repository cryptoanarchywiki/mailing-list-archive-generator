-.Did y'all see the NBC (I think, got this from a friend) ad for the new
-.monitoring system for cars?  It's based apparently on the lo-jac  (spelling
-.unsure) technology, but expanded so the monitor can locate the  car anytime
-.immediately, and can determine all car statuses such as  whether the engine
-.is on (and the monitor can kill that), how much gas  is in the car, whether
-.the windows are up, roof up, everything  basically.  So if they want to
-.detain somebody, they turn off the  engine, put the windows up, lock the
-.doors, and have someone come and  get you (you're locked in until they get
-.there, see).

-.BTW, this is a reality now.  This was an ad for a current service. This
-.apparently is part of the reason why all cars now are moving in the 
-.direction of more electronic features, all of which can be put under 
-.centralized control.
