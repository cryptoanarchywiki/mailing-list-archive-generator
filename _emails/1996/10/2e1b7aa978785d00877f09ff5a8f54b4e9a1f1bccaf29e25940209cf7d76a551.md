So could anyone anyway by asking the TRP.  The TRP returns a Yes/No
answer, withou disclosing the session key.  Is your binding scheme motivated mainly
by avoiding that workload on the TRP ?  Or by the fact that everybody might
prefer a different TRP ?

I suspect the scheme is incomplete anyway.  After skimming the web page I
see that the aim is to show the same session key has been encrypted under
different ElGamal pubkeys.  Now who's to say those pubkeys belong to anyone ?
Or is this what is meant by "such as Margaret's identity" ?  You'd list the
ids of the TRPs and also prove that the pubkeys used were theirs ....  ?


Now to the politics...

The usual Big Problems for GAK 

  1)  What's in it for the user ?
  2)  What happens when the Feds recover meaningless data ?

2 does not seem to be addressed except by proposing restrictions
which Eric dismisses as follows:
