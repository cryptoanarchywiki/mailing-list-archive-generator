I guess this is the crux of the matter.  I believe that most or all of
ITAR's munitions should be constitutionally as arms.

I doubt they were unanimous on most any issue.

Yep, when they saw that some of the principles which help fuel the
Revolution could be used to oppose a new order they adopted some of the
same tactics and governmental view points of their former oppressors. The
original calls for strong states rights and a weak central authority were
swept away under Hamilton and early Supreme Court rulings.  In some sense,
the new government became just different clothing on the same old body.

        [The Constitution preserves] the advantage of being armed which
        Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation
        [where] the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.

>[PS. Why do you privilege the authors of the bill of rights over the

Many of the framers, their mentors (e.g., Machiavelli) and even
dyed-in-the-wool pacificists (e.g., Mahatma Gandhi) feared a central
authority which, after making arms unavailable to general population would
commence to tyranny.

If I did I appologize.  It was not intentional.

I hope that includes all comuniques from our government's Executive branch
(although they almost never discuss these things publitically, with the
possible exception of our raid on Kadaffi).  How about the popular U.S.
consensus that the government aught to have killed Saddam?

Seems to me that some of the natural rights the people gave the government
need to be taken back (such as the perogative for personal actions
affecting those outside the U.S.)  Though I doubt that the government would
ever allow it. Why should the government call all the foreign policy shots
and have all the fun?  Especially when you see what a poor track record
they have.  Seems they should step aside for while and let some direct
democracy go to work for a change.

Thanks for your informative responses.  I don't expect a reply as you've
undoubtedly placed me in your kill file (as some other may have already).
