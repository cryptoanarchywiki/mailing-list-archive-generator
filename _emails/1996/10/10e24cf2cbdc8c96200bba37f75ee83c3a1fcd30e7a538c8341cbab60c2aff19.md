Your point what that customers do not care.  I gave examples showing they
clearly do care.  The fact that disclosures of questionable banking l
practices cause customers to move their money is the active issue.  While
these may result in A and B above, that is entirely irrelevant.

I'm not sure why this has anything to do with my assertion that anonymous
money, when connected to regulation infringing conduct, tends to repell
banking customers with "legitimate" sources, except perhaps that you felt
you had to do a little grandstanding.  For the record I agree that
Switzerland's curtailing of banking secrecy has driven out some money, but
bear in mind that it has also brough a lot of money in.  To state, by the
way, that Switzerland no longer upholds investor anonyminity (or depositor
anonyminity) is an innaccuracy and an oversimplification.  This is not to
say that I like the trend, just pointing out that you have managed to skew
the facts.

What connection might this have to the threat of increased regulation by
the banking authorities or the SBA due to large scale public disclosures
of questionable banking practices?  The answer is left as an exercise to
the student.

every government that may be interested.  

No, so you can verify that banks suffer losses following the disclosure of
questionable banking practices like randsom payoffs.

Where, by the way, did I indicated otherwise?

And, incidently, the terms legitimate and illegitimate money are related,
in my view, only to the presence of regulation, not the moral or ethical
standing of the funds themselves.

Given the woeful lack of facts and misconceptions you expose in your own
knowledge, I think you might wish to reconsider your own position and then
revisit the above line.

Walter Wriston was still  alive and well. :) (Incase you are too clueless

Walter Wriston [sic] is in much disfavor in the banking industry just now.
Attempts at name dropping aside, my invitation for you to do a bit more
research on banking and the actual nature of anonymous banking is renewed.
