Thanks for helping to demolish Koops' argument, what little there is of it.  
It's particularly inappropriate that he would try to use a "game" analogy to 
defend his idea, because games are generally considered voluntary and it's 
obvious that his invention would not be used in a purely voluntary basis.  
Even if the only interference is the taxation of people who don't "play" and 
the subsidy of people who do, that can't be consider a voluntary arrangement.

I look at it this way:  Koops is building only one piece in a jigsaw puzzle 
of tyranny.  He doesn't want to talk about the complete picture, but it's 
there and it's not pretty.
