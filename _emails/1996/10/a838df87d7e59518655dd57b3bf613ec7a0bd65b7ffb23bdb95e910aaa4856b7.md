sorry, I must have been distracted with the references
to assassinating politicians. (hee, hee)  (BTW, why don't you
get an AP web site together if you are so hot on the idea?
collect all your writing on the subject and the objections
of your enemies. do you believe in it or not? put your web pages
where your mouth is!!)

but then again, if "we the people" didn't challenge a usurpation of
our rights when it happened, something's wrong here. hence my
opinion that wiretapping should be challenged in court.

>Are police entitled to use thumbscrews if simply asking a question won't get

very poor analogy. a rhetorical loser imho characterisitic of 
painting the issue in terms of extremism.  wiretapping doesn't involve 
any physical pain to the surveilled. also it is barely analogous
to "search and seizure" in that there is nothing physical being
seized. (just playing the devil's advocate here)

well, if the person entered in a contract with their phone company
to provide protected communications, maybe you'd have a case there.
in fact such a thing is not such a bad idea. perhaps some would be
willing to pay a premium for phone companies that reject wiretaps
and the whole thing could be solved ala capitalism. perhaps as a
"thousand phone companies bloom" over the next few years this 
will become a reality, assassin-boy.

on the other hand, there are clear laws that say you can't withhold
evidence. these and the "right not to incriminate" are intertwined.

no, you have it backwards; without real challenges, there 
is no validity to anyone trying to defeat the status quo.

no, ITAR has been around a long time and they are challenging it. you're
mixing up the issue.

ah yes, we revert to the basic cypherpunk nihilist position oft repeated
by lucky green, tcmay etc-- "essentially, we're screwed"

interesting and very significant point, one that I was not aware of.
more good legal arguments for challenging "secret wiretaps".

more and more I think cpunks could win on this issue by asserting
that the government doesn't have a right to "*secret* wiretaps" of
the kind they are pushing and ramming down via CALEA. if we got
a court to agree that secret wiretaps are illegitimate, that
leaves the government only with "announced" ones, something
that cpunks find permits an acceptable level of monkeywrenching.
i.e. start making the distinction between the way wiretaps are
secret and the suspect is not ever informed of the wiretapping,
contrary to physical search-and-seizure procedures.
