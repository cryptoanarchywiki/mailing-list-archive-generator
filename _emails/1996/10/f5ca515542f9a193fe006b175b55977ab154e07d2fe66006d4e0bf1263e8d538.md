Your command:

                          SIGNOFF COOL_TRAVELS

has been received. For security reasons, you are now required to reply to
this  message, as  explained  below,  to confirm  the  execution of  your
command. If  you have problems with  this procedure, you can  contact the
list owner directly  (COOL_TRAVELS-request@LISTSERV.XWEB.EDS.COM) and ask
to be manually removed from the list.

To confirm  the execution of  your command,  simply reply to  the present
message and type  "ok" (without the quotes) as the  text of your message.
Just the word "ok" - do not  retype the command. This procedure will work
with any mail  program that fully conforms to the  Internet standards for
electronic  mail. If  you receive  an error  message, try  sending a  new
message  to  LISTSERV@LISTSERV.XWEB.EDS.COM  (without using  the  "reply"
function - this  is very important) and  type "ok 7B3F47" as  the text of
your message.

Finally,  your command  will be  cancelled  automatically if  you do  not
confirm it  within 48h. After that  time, you must start  over and resend
the command to get  a new confirmation code. If you  change your mind and
decide that  you do NOT want  to confirm the command,  simply discard the
present message and let the command expire on its own.
