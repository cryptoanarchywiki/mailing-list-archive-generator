   "Hitachi, Fujitsu to develop key-code data security
   system."

      They will cooperate to develop "hack-proof" encryption
      for telecommunications networks. Planning for the
      system includes formation of a "bank" to maintain
      duplicates of decoding keys, an aspect which has
      raised some concern over potential invasions of
      privacy. The U.S. has been lobbying other nations to
      adopt such a system.

   "Singapore devises system to combat Internet business
   fraud."

      The new technology, known as the Singapore Enterprise
      Security Architecture (SESA), could be applied over
      the Internet "within the next few months" in
      Singapore. It may begin in Singapore first and then,
      depending on the response from those outside,
      overseas."

   Patent: "Computerized theme park information management
   system utilizing partitioned smart cards and biometric
   verification."
