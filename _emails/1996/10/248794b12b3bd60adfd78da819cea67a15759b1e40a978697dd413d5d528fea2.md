21st Century Banking Alert No. 96-10-17
October 17, 1996

National Security Agency Report Raises
Systemic Security Issues Related to Anonymous Electronic Money


     A recent report prepared by the Cryptology Division of the National
Security Agency's Office of Information Security Research and Technology
discusses the potential for security failures in certain electronic cash
systems and their likely consequences.  While demonstrating concern over the
attributes of non-traceable electronic money, the report points out methods
that may be used to minimize security breaches and losses, including
limiting the number of coins that can be affected by a single compromise,
requiring traceability for large transactions or large numbers of
transactions in a given period, and the creation of a mechanism to restore
traceability under certain circumstances.  The report contains an excellent
summary of basic electronic money cryptographic tools, electronic cash
protocols, authentication and signature techniques and related security
issues.
