Among the possessions of a murder victim (not suspect), the local police
have found a floppy disk with some provocative-sounding files on it. Rather
than getting them into the habit of cracking other people's personal files,
I'd prefer to give them the password myself, but there seems to be no freely
available cracker for WordPerfect 6.x, and I'm not sure this one-time use is
worth $100 to me. Can anyone lend a hand? Just four small files. I can give
you more than enough details off the list to assure you that this is totally
on the level. Feel free to discuss the implications of providing such help. 

Failing that, does anyone have a technical, political, or personal
preference for or against AccessData or CRAK, who sell the two commercial
crackers I've found?
