Prediction:  Nothing much will happen to European Union bank.

Possibily their US web site will be closed down, in which case

Lesson learned.  The United States is just a speed bump on the information
highway.

The critical error is not involving the United States directly, the 
critical error is leaving assets or information in a place and form

I see no reason to believe the EUB has made this error.
