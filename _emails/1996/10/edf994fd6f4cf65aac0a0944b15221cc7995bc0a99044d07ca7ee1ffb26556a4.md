Recollect all those World War II propoganda movies where 
the evil Nazi would sneer:
"Ve know you have relatives in ze Fatherland"

According Scientific American (page 40, october 1996, 
an early version of a proposed German web control law 
would require operators of "media services" to provide 
German authorities with the name of a german resident 
who would be "subject to unlimited criminal liabilities".

The Scientific American commentator predicted a low
rate of compliance.
