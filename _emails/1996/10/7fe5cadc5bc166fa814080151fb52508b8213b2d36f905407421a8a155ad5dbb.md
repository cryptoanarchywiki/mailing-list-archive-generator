I have records of three warnings to discontinue sending robotic email
harrassments.  I think that 3 instances of "send no mail whatsoever to
the domains of scytale.com and cybrspc.mn.org" carries some weight.

Unwanted physical mail doesn't cost me money to receive.  Unwanted
email, on the other hand, carries a real and calculable cost.  I don't
have flat rate access to a POP mailbox.  I have UUCP mail forwarding for
my 2 domains, carrying hourly connect fees.  How does this differ from
the cost of consumable fax machine supplies?

IANAL, but at least one interpretation I've read finds a computer, modem and
printer equivalent to a fax machine.  And CyberPromo's mail campaign is
"continuing, persistent, and extensive", given that the messages persist
in the face of no less than 8 demands that they cease.

The invoices I send clearly state that the charges are handling fees for
harrassing email, and include dates and message id's.  I'm not invoicing
for copier toner or light bulbs.  I'm keeping copies of the
harrassments, as well.  Therefore, I'm charging for a service actually
provided: that of handling the harrassment.  Let him sue.

True enough, but I'm going to do what I can.
