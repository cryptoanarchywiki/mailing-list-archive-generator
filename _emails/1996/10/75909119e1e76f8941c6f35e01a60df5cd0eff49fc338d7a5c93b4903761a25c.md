Mark and friends -

I just returned from the Internet Expo in Boston, at which the NSA had a booth 
where they were pushing the FORTEZZA card. Some interesting things (at least 
to me):

* Netscape has a working prototype of their browser and server that uses
  FORTEZZA for encryption

* There are three (or 4??) companies building FORTEZZA cards, including 
  National Semi (the only one I recognized).

* The NSA guy I talked to said that they planned to market a "token card" 
  that uses RSA/DES, instead of Skipjack and friends, "sometime next year".
