QUOTE

A direct quote from:   http://www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/spam.html

We think that junk email should be made illegal in the same way that
junk faxes have been outlawed in the US. Unfortunately it will take
lawmakers some time to get around to it, and even then spammers would
probably try remailing through other jurisdictions to evade
regulation. 

END QUOTE.

I have only posted to this list RE: Internet Marketing and Spam.  I 
have found that the general feeling runs against regulation of the 
internet.  These Junkbuster people are crying for government 
intervention.  The government coming into the internet is a bad idea.
Therefore: Junkbusters is a bad idea.
