	Just finished with 'The Cobweb' by Neal Stephenson and his
uncle,* writing under the nym Stephen Bury.  The Cobweb is
entertaining, and easily worth the $14 I paid.

	Its cpunk relevance is a little limited except for the Iowa
deputy sheriff who figures out an Iraqi biolological weapons scheme in
the US, while the CIA, FBI and NSA fight State, Agriculture
and each other over how, or if, to react.  Mercenary Soviet Antonov
transport planes, stateless Kurds, and encrypted radio links all play
their parts.  We never do find out if the NSA can decrypt them in time.

	ISBN 0-552-37828-7.  Bantam, Sept 1996.


*I forget his uncle's name; hes a history professor who can't be seen
writing books with a Sci-fi author like Neal.  The usefulness of nyms.
They also wrote 'Interface.'
