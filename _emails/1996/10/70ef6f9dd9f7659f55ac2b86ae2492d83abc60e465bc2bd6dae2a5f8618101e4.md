In the UK, the National Lottery is run by a company called Camelot (in 
case anyone didn't know)

A while back, they introduced a new option, in that if you checked a 
certain box on your ticket, 6 numbers would be 'chosen' for you, 
presumably 'randomly'

Does anyone have any info on how this system works?

i.e. The PRNG used? Whether the PRNG is in the shop terminal or at the 
central computer @ Camelot? et cetera.

(I am looking at the problems of PRSG for my Masters dissertation - hence 
the interest) 

Please reply either to the cypherpunks list or to my e-mail address if 
you think this doesn't have any crypto-relevance.

Thanks in advance...
