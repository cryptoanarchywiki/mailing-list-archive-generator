Is this good advice?  When attacked, isn't it good to offer as strong a
defense as possible including (but not limited to) verbal abuse, physical
confrontations, countersuits, standing outside people's houses, picketing,
letters, public appearances, urging other people to express their views, etc.

What is lost by a complete defense.  If you develop a nasty reputation,
people eventually leave you alone.  It doesn't even hurt you in court.  See
for example the new Milos Forman film "The People vs. Larry Flynt."  In
spite of Larry's tactics, Justice Rhenquist gave him the unanimous decision
he wanted from the Supremes.
