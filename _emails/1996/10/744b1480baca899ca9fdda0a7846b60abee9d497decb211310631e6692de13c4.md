Although using physical/electrical attacks to cause circuit disruptions to
ICs (like smartcard) may be feasible, it appears to be much more difficult
to mount this sort of attack on specially hardened crypto modules, which
can more effectively isolate themselves from invasive sources or detect
them and take action (i.e., key clearance) before an attacker can pry out
their secrets.
