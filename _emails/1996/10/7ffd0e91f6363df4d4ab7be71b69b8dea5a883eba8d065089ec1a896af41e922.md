Not to me. Geographic diversification requires either significant 
research on part of the individual or trusting one's assets to the 
goodwill of third party consultants.

There are a number of individuals on this list that have claimed in the 
past to know the detailed techniques required to achieve such 
diversification. Not one of them has ever posted "How To" instructions to 
the list. Sure, we heard many generalities, but never concrete instructions.

Tim has asked several times on this list for details, but, to the best of my 
knowledge, was never provided with a workable solution to secure his 
fortune, most of which seems to be held in stock in the US.

Compare this to the dozens of FAQs available for crypto. If they were 
limited to "find some cryptographic software, it will protect your data", 
considerably fewer individuals would use PGP.

Crypto FAQs have URLs, step-by-step instructions, etc. I have not seen 
anything even remotely like it for asset diversification.
