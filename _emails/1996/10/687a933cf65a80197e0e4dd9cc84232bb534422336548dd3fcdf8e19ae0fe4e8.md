The difference is, Tombstone people didn't have computers and instant 
communications all over the world.  If the govt. of 1881 were to send 
bunches of troops to Tombstone to raid the place and kill everyone, the 
poor slobs who lived there might not even know in advance to protect 
themselves or run away, save a relatively new invention called the 
telegraph.  We lived with the telegraph and iron horse, and we'll live 
with crypto and AP (some of us, anyway, hee hee).

I wonder what "proper" tribunals might be.  Ramsey Clark wrote 
extensively about the convictions of Bush, Schwartzkopf, and others, but 
all that happened in the "great white world" was these folks getting 
knighted by Her Majesty.  Try to visualize Bush and Schwartzkopf down on 
their knees with the queen's sword over their heads.  Justice has to 
start at the top, not with Bosnia.

1. If you find the duplicity appalling, why would you want to invite
   those same lying scum to preside over the "war crimes tribunals"?

2. I don't think those leaders are trying to catch terrorists who might
   attack "their citizens", their concern is to catch terrorists who
   threaten their money directly, and citizens are important to them
   only in the same sense as workers in a corporation to a supervisor:
   The more underlings you have under you, the more you get paid.

Every year some 60,000 people die and hundreds of thousands are severely 
injured in the U.S. from traffic "accidents", which are almost totally 
the result of unnecessary acts of aggression by neurotic drivers who 
will not give the proper safe space to others.  And this is deliberate, 
don't forget.  And you worry more about mistakes?

Beating up on dogs and monkeys, tsk tsk.  Sounds like speciesism.
Next thing you know, it's racism, sexism, and homophobia. Besides,
what's to fear from spiteful and arrogant players?  You'll know
who they are in advance.

Gotta give Atilla credit - business is business.  It's not like the Pope 
doesn't know the risks of sitting up there and collecting the glory (and 
the money).

Yeah.  At Nurnburg, how many were tried, and how many were executed? 
Very, very few.  John J. McCloy is reputed to have arranged the trials 
in the first place so we could launder out the guys (and their secrets) 
we needed to keep, to fight the Cold War.  Justice?  Or just us?

Why do you have to equate what we have now with leaders?  Are you saying 
that Dick Armey, Charles Schumer, Newt Gingrich, Larry Eagleburger, and 
Brent Scowcroft (to name a few) are leaders?  Like Martin Luther King, 
Jr. was a leader?  Surely you jest!

I see here a passionate, emotional, and nostalgic argument for what 
never truly was; an illusion as it were.  We'd be better off with 
reality, and without these parasites.  It's called growing up, getting 
off of the really bad kind of welfare, dependence on lying scummy 
parasitical politicians who'd run over their own grandmother to get 
their man elected.  And BTW, I'm sure the SOB Colson actually said it.

Gosh darn.  Think of what the world would be like if we had to take Suzy 
down to the independent book store, the one with all those conspiracy 
and new-agey sensitivity books and stuff.  Wouldn't be nearly as comfy 
as the trip to Borders with the Starbucks coffee shop inside.

Did you ever think about legality?  Why were the laws developed?  To 
protect us, the little guys?  Please be a little cynical, anyway.  The 
laws were developed to protect the big guys and their investments, be it 
the Constitution (protecting slave owners and the Yankee investors who 
depended on Southern production), the USC and UCC, or NAFTA and GATT.

Serve the people.  Good idea.  Assassination has been serving the big 
guys essentially unimpeded by public objection or protest, so how can a 
person argue against AP without first applying the objection to govt.?

When the U.S. Justice Dept. can fake evidence to "get" someone they 
don't like (Demjanjuk, for example), and then the Israeli supreme court, 
realizing that the U.S. govt. has far less integrity than they'd 
imagined, had to release the man because of this embarassment, in spite 
of vehement opposition in their own back yard, what do we do then?

Actually, when the authorities become as corrupt as they have in the 
U.S., the law of the jungle is already applied defacto to the masses 
anyway.  Again, laws mainly protect those the lawmakers serve, and the 
little people get just the crumbs when the system is more-or-less young 
and working.  When the system gets older and more corrupt, even the 
crumbs are hard to come by.  It'll be interesting to see what they'll do 
to pacify Maxine Waters on this CIA/crack cocaine expose.  You just know 
there won't possibly be any real justice, not with the SS/CIA involved.
