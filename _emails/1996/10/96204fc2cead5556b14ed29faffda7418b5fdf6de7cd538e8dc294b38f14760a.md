   10-27-96. WaPo:

   "Heightened Tensions Over Digital Taps. Telecommunications
   Industry, FBI at Odds Over High-Tech Tools"

      Telco officials say that the FBI aims to force phone
      companies to build extensive surveillance systems into
      their telephone networks that will likely open new
      avenues of surveillance for government wiretappers.

      Freeh has testified that his agency is "simply trying to
      catch up with technology." In recent interviews,
      however, his senior aides insisted there are virtually
      no limits to the types and amount of information they
      can intercept once a judge signs a court order.

      "It would be stupid of us, as a police agency, not to take
      advantage of information in the system to solve crime,"
      said James Kallstrom. "That shouldn't shock you. The
      technology offers a lot more."
