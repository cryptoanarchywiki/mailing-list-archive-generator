And just what would you call PGP?

Long before the MIT deal, people in the U.S. were using their "OK in
America" (not counting RSADSI's issues) software to communicate with
"illegally exported" copies in foreign lands.

This model--leaking a U.S. version and then communicating freely between
U.S. sites and the "leakee" sites--worked for PGP. I believe the USG fears
this will happen again.

Hence my speculation that they may try to illegalize the mere communication
with an offending product.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
