   "Check Point to Provide Safeguard Against TCP SYN 
   Flooding." 
 
      The new module, now available free of charge on Check 
      Point's Web site (http://www.checkpoint.com), provides 
      protection against this denial of service attack, which 
      has crippled several ISPs in recent weeks. 
 
   "Certicom Introduces Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem 
   Instruction To Its Security Classroom."  
 
      It has launched new information about its Elliptic Curve 
      Cryptosystem on the Information Security Classroom 
      section of its web site (www.certicom.ca). 
 
   "IBM to herd cave-in cats for rat encryption." 
 
      IBM will be joined by Digital, TIS but few others. An 
      executive at TIS declined to comment on whether it is 
      involved in the IBM cave-in. The company is in a 
      quiet period before making an IPO based on government 
      bribery. 
 
   "Battle brewing over gov.crypto bribery." 
 
      Last week, the DARPA announced it has awarded Trusted 
      Information Systems, Inc. a two-year, $1.5 million 
      contract to develop what it calls security wrappers for 
      a Java Prototype System as well as one for the Unix 
      operating system.
