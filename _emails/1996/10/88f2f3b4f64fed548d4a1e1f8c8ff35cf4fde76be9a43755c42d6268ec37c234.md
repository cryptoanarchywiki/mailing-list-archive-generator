Why?  They seem just as likely as any other sequence.

I left out a piece: again heuristically speaking, most DES keys are derived from pasword hash, or
similar technique.  In such a case the statistics of the generated keys are (it looks like) _highly_
skewed.

Again, which randomness property?

The property that essentially _no_ predictability is found in a hash-derived key.
