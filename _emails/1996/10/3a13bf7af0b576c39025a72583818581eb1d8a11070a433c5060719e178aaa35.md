I'm very sorry that you apparently didn't show up to discuss your
concerns; I thought the talk went quite well, with some good give and
take, but nobody really tried hard to tear apart FV's system.  Believe
it or not, that was a disappointment to me.  I always enjoy an open
debate with a spirited opponent.

FYI, the content of the talk was largely the same as the content of my
paper that appeared in the June issue of Communications of the ACM, in
the special issue on electronic commerce.  Readers of this list will be
particularly interested in the section entitled "Cryptography:  Myths
and Realities".
