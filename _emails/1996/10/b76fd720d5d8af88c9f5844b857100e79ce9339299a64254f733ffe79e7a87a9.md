The L.A. Times has run at least 3 major (full- or nearly-full-page) 
articles on encryption subjects in the last 4 or 5 working days.

Tuesday's (8 Oct) article concerns Doug Kozlay, a "former" researcher 
for NSA.  A few excerpts:

"Not a dollar (of 2 trillion in govt. payments) goes through unless the 
electronic key Kozlay invented turns in an electronic lock..."

"He (Kozlay) envisions future consumers using electronic cash cards with 
all the anonymity and easy spending of paper money."

"All the new devices he imagines would be protected by IRE's encryption 
technology."

The article goes on to describe how could standardize encryption all 
across the Internet.  IRE has a current contract to encrypt MCI's 
Internet access service, for $12 million.
