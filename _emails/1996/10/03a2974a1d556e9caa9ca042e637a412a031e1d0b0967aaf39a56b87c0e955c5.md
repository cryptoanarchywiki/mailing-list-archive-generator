Censorship is something else than demanding (and checking) that people comply
with the policy of a voluntary system. Would you consider Microsoft sueing users
of illegal Microsoft software also a "censorship".

There is no harm in firing at somebody, harm is only done when hit somebody.
Distribution is part of the manufactury process. Don't go to Belgium for a
vacation, and start stating these kind of things.

I agree to some extend that our system could be used in a totalitarian country, to make
certain censorship possible. On the other hand, it doesn't make their job especially easy:
they can forbid and control any type of "strange" data, i.e. encrypted data. One could
argue that our system at least gives security between citizens. 

The whole problem is that you don't trust your government, well I do (till some
extend). I get the impression that this is a typical USA problem.
