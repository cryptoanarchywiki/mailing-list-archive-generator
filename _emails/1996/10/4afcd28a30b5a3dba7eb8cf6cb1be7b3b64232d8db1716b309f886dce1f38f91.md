Now, for those folks who oppose the personal ownership of firearms, or 
at least "really dangerous" firearms, I'd like to know exactly what's 
the difference (in principle) between the above "...high-quality 
encryption widely available so that the private sector can protect 
itself from criminal or...", and making firearms widely available?

Surely the NYT is not going to join the NRA equivalent of pro-personal- 
crypto crackpots, anarchists, and all that?
