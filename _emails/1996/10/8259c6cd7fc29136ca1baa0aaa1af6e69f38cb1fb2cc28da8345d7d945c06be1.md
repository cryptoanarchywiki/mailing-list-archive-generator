Is there, however, a notion of legitimacy here?  In other words, are PGP's
claims valid while RSA's are not?  I'm not talking under "The Law", but
under notions of what's good and what's not.  Many would assert that RSA's
IP claims are overstated, invalid, way too far reaching in scope, and that
they're being greedy bastards who are not telling the truth about what
happened with the agreement with Phil.  PGP, as far as I know, hasn't
started being "fastidious" about IP claims (in fact, I don't think their
position has changed at all), and bases their assertions on Phil's rather
straight-forward PGP license and his basic assertion that he owns the
rights to the encryption software called "PGP" and he don't want nobody
else selling it except he and his licensees.

(not taking sides here - just holding up one perspective for discussion)

Not to pick a fight, but you generally take that position with most
IP rights, correct?  I _think_ you've voiced opinions that align with some
anti-copyright positions in the past, but I may be wrong.  Stepping aside
from that for the moment, why would you feel that PGP's property rights
are not respectable?

Ditto.
