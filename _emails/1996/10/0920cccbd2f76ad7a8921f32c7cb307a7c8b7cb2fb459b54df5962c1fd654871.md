The "impractical" I was referring to is the impracticality of the government 
implementing and enforcing restrictions on communications using (non-GAK) 
crypto.  The only place this seems to exist is in ham radio.

The crypto itself is eminently practical, as the PGP example makes 
absolutely clear.
