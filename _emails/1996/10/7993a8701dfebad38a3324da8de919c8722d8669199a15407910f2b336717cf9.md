This really doesn`t seem a good idea to me seeing as not only are we 
going to be wasting time on an LFSR runtime wise but we will be 
covering a lot of duplicate keyspace, if you look at the mersenne 
prime finding exercise which has its homepages somewhere on 
compuserve (i`ll give the address if you need it but I can`t remember 
it at the moment) they have a set of numerical blocks of exponent 
space that are allocated to people then removed from the list, not an 
option of course if we are going to be "stealing" runtime, unless we 
do it on networked workstations using some sort of UDP packet or 
similar.
