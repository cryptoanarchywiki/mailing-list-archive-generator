Hi all,

I'm Alex Newman, on of the conference organizers for "Computers & The
Law III", Dec 1-4, 1996 in San Jose, CA.  The theme this year is
"Assessing the Internet Threat".  I was wondering if there was anyone
in the San Francisco/Silicon Valley area who was going to be there who
wanted to sit on a panel about the CDA.

Drop me a line if your interested.  If you just want more information
about the conference, take a look at www.sug.org/CL3 or send mail to
conference@sug.org
