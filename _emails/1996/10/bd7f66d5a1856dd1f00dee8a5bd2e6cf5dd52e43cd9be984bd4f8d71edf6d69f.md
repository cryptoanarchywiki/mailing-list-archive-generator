Dunno - sounds to me like an act of desperation that is at least 99.44%
hype, from a company that has refused to acknowledge that the UNIX
market is crashing even as we speak. While I was Intergraph HQ in
1989-1993, we saw projections of that coming demise from IDC, etc.
Which had a lot to do with the big switch there to Intel/NT. 

Especially love the way they don't figure the price of any of those
"fat $ervers" (from guess what California company) into the overall
costs.... seems to be mostly a way to dupe folks into shifting funds
from all those wonderful, independence granting PCs into paying for
it-was-good-enough-for-my-dad-it's-good-enough-for-me big iron at
the center, with dumb terminals (no matter what you call 'em) tethered
to it. And $1500 is a lot for a dumb terminal.

And that dazzling array of nearly 500 craplets.. I mean Java apps...
that's sure a lot of eye candy, but I'd hate to try to run a business
with them.

Get real. No one, including a badly aging Sun, will ever put the
distributed computing genie back in the "glass house" bottle that
PC's allowed us to escape from DECADES ago.
