I think market forces should cope with this just fine, without
governments.  The government `stimulation' imposed by the US
government on clipper/encryption export has cost the US software
industry billions of $ in lost trade, and the US tax payer many more
millions paying for the failed secret NSA development of clipper I.

I don't see anyone calling for the `government stimulation', quite the
opposite; the US software industry is calling for removal of export
controls.  The US software industry has been extremely uncooperative
with Clipper I, II & III.  The US public out right rejected clipper I.
Then Clinton passed it as a government standard by presidential decree
anyway.  The USG achieved some small appearance of cooperation from a
few companies they black-mailed and bribed into signing on for clipper
IV.

The USG managed to persuade the OECD to discuss key escrow, and now we
see that the USG says that it must pursue key escrow because of the
pressure from the OECD.  This is simply manipulation, and deception.

I agree, binding cryptography is an important new technology for
implementing conditional third party access to keys.  Have you applied
for patents?

Cypherpunks vote is for none.  We vote that the civilized countries
set a good example to China and Singapore etc, by having no key
escrow, TTPs, TRPs etc.

If its voluntary then "abuse" is not abuse, it is just not opting to
use the voluntary system.  Where is the problem?

The problem is that you appear to want to make those who do
voluntarily use the escrow systems non-interoperable with those who
don't.  (The USG wants this also, they can coerce big business into
offering escrow software only).

I do.  I want the information society to be free.  I want free speech.
I can not do a hit and run with words.

If some group of prudish people do not want to hear free speech, they
can hide in enclaves, pay for a censored USENET feed, etc.

If the system is voluntary, circumventing it is opting not to make use
of the voluntary key escrow.  This is by definition not a crime.

I don't undestand your point.  You give away less by letting the
recipient check than you do by letting the government (point c), or
anyone (point d) check.

This is how I envisioned it working, RSA and IDEA encryption:

parties:

Alice:  Alices public key = PK_a, Alice's secret key = SK_a
Bob:    PK_b, SK_b
Government:    PK_g, SK_g

Alice is sending Bob the message M. 

E_b = RSA_encrypt( PK_b, left-pad_b || session-key || right-pad_b )
E_g = RSA_encrypt( PK_g, left-pad_g || session-key || right-pad_g )
encrypted-data = IDEA_encrypt( session-key, left-pad_g || right-pad_g || M )

Alice sends Bob:

C = E_b || E_g || encrypted-data

Bob can decrypt.  He can check that the government can decrypt by
repeating:

E_g = RSA_encrypt( PK_g, left-pad_g || session-key || right-pad_g )

If Alice replaces the session key in E_g with garbage, then the data
is not GAKed.  Bob will be able to detect this.  The government will
not (at least not without trying to decrypt).

It's voluntary, if it turns out that you did not use key escrow during
a warant, then the keys weren't escrowed.  This is what you get with a
voluntary system, people don't have to use it.

If you choose to allow the person who you are corresponding with to
verify that you are escrowing your keys, that is your business.

If you choose to allow the government also to check (option c, or d)
then that also is your business.  The whole system is voluntary.  I
don't see how you can arrange it any other way, and still claim that
it is a `voluntary' system.

The TTP might want to be the only checker.  With c), the TRP itself can not
check compliance.  The TRP has no information until the TTP decrypts, and
hands it the key for recovery.  This means the TTP does not have to trust
the TRP not to decrypt packets, without cooperation from the TTP.

user calculates:

E_trp = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_trp, session-key )

and sends:

E_ttp = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_ttp, random-pad || E_trp )
E_user = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_user, session-key )

(random-pad to avoid any further binding checks)

now TTP can check, by decrypting E_ttp to get E_trp, and using the
normal binding check that E_trp and E_user are encryptions of the same
session key.  The TTP sends TRP E_trp, and TRP can decrypts it, if the
request satisfies it's policies.

If the TTP further wishes that the TRP does not see the session key,
even when the TTP has cooperated with the TRP to get the key, you
could arrange key splitting:

user calculates:

session-key = session-A XOR session-B
E_trpa = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_trp, session-A )

user sends:

E_ttpa = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_ttp, random-pad || E_trpa )
E_ttpb = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_ttp, session-B )
E_usera = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_user, session-A )
E_userb = ElGamal_encrypt( PK_user, session-B )

recipient calculates:

session-A = ElGamal_decrypt( SK_usera, E_usera) 
session-B = ElGamal_decrypt( SK_userb, E_userb) 
session-key = session-A XOR session-B

TTP checks:

check = bind( E_usera, E_trpa ) AND bind( E_ttpb, E_userb )
session-A = ElGamal_decrypt( SK_ttp, E_ttpb) 

TRP at TTP's request:

session-B = ElGamal_decrypt( SK_trp, Etrp )

Then TTP calculates:

session-key = session-A XOR session-B
