Ah. I feel *much* better now...

For the time being, anyway.

Cheers,

Since this issue was brought up here a little while ago, it seems
appropriate to forward this..

Cyberpromo is a suspect in sending mail from a host with the name and
local domain of compuserve.com (the exact name of one of our mail
gateways)  They were creating fakeing mail headers by actually haveing a
machine on their network with the same name and domain.  I could have
thought of more creative ways to do this but this is what we saw... Since
were getting an influx of mail from upset individuals asking why
CompuServe was the host of all this spam.  After we found out what
Cyberpromo was up to, we asked for cooperation from Sprint to pull the
plug.

At this time (and to my knowledge), CompuServe has not yet made an effort
to engage in any legal action.  I am unable to comment on anything
else at this time.
