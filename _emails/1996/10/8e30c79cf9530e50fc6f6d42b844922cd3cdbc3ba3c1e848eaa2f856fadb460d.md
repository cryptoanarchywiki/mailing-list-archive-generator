I agree that binding cryptography, or any "recovery" system can be subverted
by nesting another cryptosystem into it. However, the advantages gained this way - in my
opinion are small; people wanting to do this might as well use/make their own system.

Compare this with the simple "recovery" system where users are obliged (*if* they voluntarily agree
to *use* the system) to send along a session key encrypted with a public key of a Key Recovery
Agent, and where *no* binding data is required. Then it would be trivial to convert this system
into a criminally useful one - by a simple manipulation in software - with:
- *not* having to build another cryptosystem (and its key-management) into the system;
- packets send can by no means be distinguished by third parties from "correct" ones.

As we liked the flexibility of choice in Key Recovery Agents of this system (which in our
opinion amplifies privacy properties of the scheme) we proposed binding cryptography, as
a middle between non-liberal private key escrow and the too liberal simple "recovery" system.

We know, see above.

I think that architectural problems with key-escrow systems are more
difficult than that associated with our scheme. The NRC study in fact
raises the question of key-escrow on a large scale is at all possible.

I respect your opinion, but I think there is a middle ground. Maybe you should be
ashamed for not realizing the future problems that arise when even the part of the
Global information superhighway that is paid for by society can be very conveniently
used by criminals to harm society.
