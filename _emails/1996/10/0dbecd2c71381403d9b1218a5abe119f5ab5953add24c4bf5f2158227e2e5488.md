Timothy C. May must have been sharing needles with a rabid hedgehog.

Just as a matter of interest, my own personal interest, what type of
society do you come from?  The insults are not the type normally
originating from a person of the American type culture as these
insults would mean nothing to the average American. I have been to
places where people give serious concern to such statements but I
doubt many people in those places read this list and I doubt anyone
on this list does anything but delete your messages.  But, please
give me a hint where you developed this classy style of insulting the
character of Mr T. C. May.
