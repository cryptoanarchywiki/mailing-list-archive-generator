C'mon now, you guys sound like a bunch of old men, groaning over the checkers board 
about how you can't keep track of the six or seven medications you take every day.

Some amazing and true facts:  I'm 50 years old, learning Windows programming (yuk!), and 
actually, never went to college, but make good money writing code and also teach other 
programmers certain techniques....  I can also run a mile in six minutes, and haven't 
missed a day of work since 1975.

People die, things die, so what.  There are so many things to do, and not enough people 
to do them.  Get busy and you'll feel better.

Don't expect anything to be static.  The "right kind" of talented people will find the 
other like-mind folks, on this list or elsewhere.  It doesn't need to be managed or 
bemoaned.

True invention as a concept is controversial.  One could make a valid argument that 
"new" inventions, while not new in every way, or even in a way that has agreed-upon 
significance, are nonetheless as inventive in many cases as the great ones like the 
telephone, the laser, or the public key concept. Perhaps you could analogize judgement 
of a particular invention to judgement of a person's intelligence - no clear, concise 
table of numbers to work from.

"Pinnacle" appears to be another (possibly flawed) judgement, usually be persons who 
don't fully understand the methods and motivations of individuals who have "great" 
minds.

There's a scene in the old Star Trek, in one of the very first episodes, when Gary 
somebody-or-other starts getting a *lot* smarter after passing through a barrier at the 
edge of the galaxy.  Kirk walks into the sick bay, and seeing Gary(?) reading some 
really deep stuff on the computer, says something to the effect "I never knew you got 
into person xxx, etc.", to which Gary replies "actually, he's kind of simple once you do 
get into him, childlike, even."

My suggestion is, learn to be more like that (you can, actually), and save the nostalgia 
for appropriate situations.  Don't put yourself down with all that hero-worship.  That's 
for kids.
