I can`t do the port myself unless the PC code is going to be in C as 
I don`t write amiga assembler anymore (not for about 2 years).

As for the speed I have an A4000/030 here which is about equivalent 
to a 486 dx 33 or similar and the average amiga, an A1200 is about 
the same as a 486 sx 25

I really don`t think a port is worth doing though because there are 
few amiga owners who use the internet extensively because the TCP/IP 
stack (amitcp) for the amiga is a load of crap.
