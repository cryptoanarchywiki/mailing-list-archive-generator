I suggest you RTFM again. It was a commentary on the sad state of 
scientific practice as germain to today's egomanical pirannah who inhabit 
the domain of the "scientist". To publish is to exist, and the first rule 
is "draw your curves, then plot your points." The second is "Thou shalt 
not critisize your mentor."

Save the anti-religion rhetoric for someone who gives a damn.

...Paul
