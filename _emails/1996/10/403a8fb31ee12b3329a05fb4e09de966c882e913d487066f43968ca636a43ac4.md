If you define off-the-shelf as what comes on the CD-ROM, true.  We certainly
couldn't find drivers for half the protocals we use...

Otherwise, I'd be tempted to point out the hazards in trusting one piece of
code more than another.  Particularly since that linux box would come with
source code, whereas most NT services don't...


Also, it came as a great shock to me that there was an "average" linux
install.  Is there an average Linux anything? <g>
