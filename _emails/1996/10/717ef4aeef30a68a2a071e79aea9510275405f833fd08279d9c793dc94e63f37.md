I'm enclosing a header taken from a message in <Cypherpunks Lite Digest
96/10/05>. Can anyone tell me how to determine (1) who wrote it; (2) who
sent it  to me; (3) Who was the original recipient?

It seems like it's to Cypherpunks Lite <cp-lite@comsec.com>, but that can't
be it, since the author starts by saying "I must first say that your
program is one of the finest in news reporting, and I tune in every day."

I must first say that your program is one of the finest in news
