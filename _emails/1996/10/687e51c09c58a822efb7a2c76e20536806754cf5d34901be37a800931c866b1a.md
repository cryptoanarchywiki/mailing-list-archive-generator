Interesting (potentially; the Anonymizer isn't currently listening to me,
and I'm not going to set up an account non-anonymized there.
The operator nicely provides an Anonymized URL for getting there.)
SSL is down, ostensibly for performance reasons.

The mail system says it's basically pseudonymous - there's a privacy policy
which says he doesn't log what accounts belong to whom.
If the government wants to use subpoenas or warrants to seize his logs,
the operator won't stop them, but the log files will be disappointing...

The IP address is in space that appears to be hotwired.com Class C space.
Poking around whois was interesting.....
