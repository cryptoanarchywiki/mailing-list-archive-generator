Not that I recall. From the excerpts you included, it looks very naive, in
the sense of being unsophisticated. And the "NSA is forbidden by law" point
is a real howler; obviously the authors are unaware of Bamford's book, not
to mention other confirmations of NSA domestic intercepts.

Sure, with "traffic escrow," all traffic will be escrowed. Of course, there
are just a few minor problems with the Constitution saying one has to
escrow what's on one's computers without a warrant, and with privacy issues
galore. And there the minor issue of storage of all of these terabytes of
data....

But if RAND wants to get on the bucks being doled out over this
"information warfare" hype, they've got to put some of their best and
brightest new college grads to writing papers like this.
