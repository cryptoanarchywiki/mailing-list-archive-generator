When I subscribed to this list, I thought it would have decent
communication on worthwhile topics.  I've come to realize though that 75%
of the messages I receive are from people whining like 4 year olds.  I am
making a huge assumption in saying that most of the people on this list
are adults.  It is time to start acting like it.

Please take my name off of this list.
