Considering the situation -- considering that RSA has even signed on 
to this scheme -- I'd have to say that I don't give a rat's ass what 
Bill Gates claims.  If Micro$oft bucks the system, I'll gladly 
applaud their stand.  
        
The situation is not good at all.

Cracking DES (whether distributed or through a hardware crack, or 
both!) seems critical at this point.
