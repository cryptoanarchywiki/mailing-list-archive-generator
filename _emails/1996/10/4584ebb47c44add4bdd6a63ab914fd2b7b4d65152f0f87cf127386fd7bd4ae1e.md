Title: Non-Malleable Cryptography
 Speaker: Cynthia Dwork, IBM Almaden Research Center

ABSTRACT:
The notion of {\it non-malleable} cryptography,
an extension of semantically secure cryptography,
will be defined.
Informally, in the context of encryption
the additional requirement is that
given the ciphertext it is impossible to generate
a {\it different} ciphertext so that the respective
plaintexts are related.
Common public key cryptosystems are quite malleable:
for example, in RSA it is trivial to compute
$E(2x)$ given only $E(x)$.
Although defined with public key cryptography in mind,
non-malleability issues also arise in private-key cryptography.
Indeed, the security of
many common protocols, such as Kerberos, relies
implicitly on the inability of an adversary to compute $E(f(N))$
given only $E(N)$, for simple functions $f$.
The talk will focus on non-malleable public key cryptosystems.
with a few remarks on non-malleable schemes for
private-key cryptography, string commitment,
and proofs of possession of knowledge.

This is joint work with Danny Dolev and Moni Naor.
