I guess I was mistaken about how rigorous identification checking was
performed at various CAs.  Verisign used to advertise three levels of CA
checking, although I can only find two on their Web site at this time.  The
lowest, Class 1, is simply tied to your email address and is inadequate for
my purposes.  Class 2 Digital IDs provide identity assurance by requiring
third-party confirmation of your name, mailing address, and other personal
information.  Although by no means bullet-proof dependence on Class 2 might
be a workable alternative to a substantial, up-front, money escrow (as
suggested) which I believe would make my service unworkable.
