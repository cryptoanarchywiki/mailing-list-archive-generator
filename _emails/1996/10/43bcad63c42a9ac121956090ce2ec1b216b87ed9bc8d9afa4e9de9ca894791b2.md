No, Mathematical proof makes it true...

Absolute sanctimonious twaddle, the algorithm has already been 
analytically compromised by Adam Shostack with a known plaintext 
attack requiring only a few bytes of known text, I have also 
theoretically compromised the system using timing attacks, 
furthermore I believe that linear and differential cryptanalysis may 
provide an even more efficient attack, though I have yet to take the 
time to see if this is indeed true, whatever the case, the algorithm 
is broken, there is nothing more to discuss

For the last time it is not a one time pad, it is a stream cipher, 
and furthermore it is an insecure stream cipher, soon available in a 
town near you.

As I said, they are not OTPs and they never will be, they are not 
provably secure and are therefore not a one time pad.

Well said Perry.

It appears the IPG guy needs to perfect his Latin too, the phrase is 
nihil est demonstratum - nothing has been proved (perfect tense)
There is no such Latin word as demonstandum.

And what they know believe is that you are a fool, in addition to 
this they can prove mathematically that the system you have put 
foward is a stream cipher and not a one time pad, and that it is 
insecure.

Absolutely, your system is therefore provably not a one time pad, the 
very definition of which is that it has equal or greater state than 
the message it is used to encrypt.

Rubbish, we have not extrapolated anything, Shannon proved in a 
statistical framework of pure mathematics that the only provably 
secure system is a true one time pad, NOT you system.

So you are claiming now that your system does not use arithmetic? - 
tell us how my good man, you may well have discovered the worlds 
first non arithmeric algorithm to use a purely arithmeric machine to 
execute it.

The above passage is an oxymoron, it is plainly a contradiction in 
terms to call a PRNG an OTP.

It is not only a PRNG stream, it is an insecure PRNG stream as Adam 
and I have shown.

Rubbish.

If the entropy is limited, you do not have a One Time Pad, period, end
of discussion, its over.

Your whole diatribe on this subject has been utter bullshit, 
throughout the whole discussion you have made no effort to listen to 
what people have said, and you have made no effort to understand our 
attacks on your system, god only knows why we bothered, you system 
really doesn`t deserve our valuable time.

An insecure stream cipher you are planning to flog to unsuspecting 
people knowing nothing about cryptography using the same mindless 
technobabble and high worded crap you have used on this list.

We have already established that your cipher is easy to
break, so your mindless babble that it is secure really don't matter.

We will ignore you from now on, you are really just an insignificant 
silly little man...
