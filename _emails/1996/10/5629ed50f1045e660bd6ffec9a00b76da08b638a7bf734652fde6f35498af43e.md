After considering everything carefully, yeah, it's probably good to make a
strong statement disputing the essentials of the suit. But given the
counterintuitive nature of contributory infringement, it's also probably
good to think carefully about what to say, when. I wasn't trying to tell
Sameer what to do - just trying to make it clear that it's normal for him
to take a few days or longer to say anything. I'm sure the SPA's press
release was cleared by their legal people - it was probably prepared before
the suits were even filed.
