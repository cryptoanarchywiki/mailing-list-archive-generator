I think any protocol even similar to one used in a financial type 
transaction, protected by DES would be a good target.  The press 
could say that DES, the same algorithm used to protect financial 
transactions, has been broken.  

Hal Finney provided the target data in the last couple of these
distributed cracks, I believe. 

Sounds like there needs to be much more involvement in this one,
because of the number of cycles required.  The doling out of keys
will be a bigger job, also.  If a 100 Mhz Pentium takes 4133 years,
then I guess 4133 Pentiums takes 1 year.  One year is too long to
prove the point of weakness.
