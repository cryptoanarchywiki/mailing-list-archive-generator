True, but what's reported is a joke, just like other media scams.

I didn't say no possibility, just very little probability.  And what 
motive did this wealthy man have to savagely (inhumanly, yet) murder 
those two people?  There are people who have plausible motives, though.

CIA, remotely?  I guess Colby, Jr. living next to Nicole is outside the 
boundary of remote?  I guess A.C.'s boss Ippolito, *close* friend of 
George Aronow, *close* friend of George Bush, etc. is also out of 
bounds?  Ever hear of international coke rings?  OJ was up to his neck 
in Mob, and looks like Denise Brown likewise.  Too remote for you?

Lessee, an apple and a banana are "not even remotely comparable", due to 
so many differences, etc.  But, I can eat both of them, and get 
nutrition from both, so, they *do* have quite a bit in common.
The Warren Commission, and all "official" treatments of the JFK 
assassination were not based on the real evidence, nor was the OJ trial. 
If you're one of those people who saw Ruby do it, and you said "gee, 
musta been just another wacko", then you could look at the OJ trial the 
same way and say "gee, just another crazy black man", etc.
