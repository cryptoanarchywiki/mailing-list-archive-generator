Good stego is difficult.  Very low bandwidth stego is doable, but
stego of reasonable bandwidth, and good plausible deniablity is
difficult.

What are our options?

- Stego in english text.

Highly desirable, but very difficult, I think.

- Stego in audio and graphic file formats

Easier.  Not so much plausible deniability.  You've got to scan your
own pictures, and post lots of them.  (Become an avid
alt.binaries.pictures.* poster?)

- Stego in Internet Phone protocols.

Bill Stewart discussed some of the problems with this a short while
ago.  If I recall the basic problem is that the higher quality lossy
audio compression CODECs, which typically get used for low bandwidth
(28.8k and below modems) to get reasonable quality, don't have that
much room left, as they are compressing, and lossy, and by design
trying to leave as little as possible redundancy left.

I have also seen claims made for digital watermarking, that if enough
channels and redundancy is used, that digital watermarking survives
all kinds of abuse, analogue reproduction and redigitizing, etc.

Digital watermarking that I have seen discussed most involves image
files.  Is there any published work on digital watermarking of audio
files?

It would be interesting to see if any audio watermarking techniques
survives internet phone CODECs.  However, the problem still is that
the two aims are in tension: stego is trying to make the fact that the
data is there at all undetectable, the main aim with watermarking is
that you not be able to remove all traces of watermarking, and the way
that this is achieved is to spread the watermarking through many
channels.  The fact that there is watermarking in the document is not
necessarily being concealed, the primary aim is to stop removal, and
encode the watermark so that the image is not appreciably damaged
visually.

- Stego in Internet video conference formats

This kind of technology is difficult for similar reasons to that of
audio.

Also the technology is a bit premature, I don't think you would be
able to get a very good frame rate of high resolution video over a
28.8k modem.

> Where are larger keys for symetric ciphers?

The recent discussion on using IDEA with larger keys, or using 3IDEA
(triple IDEA) might be one way to get larger key spaces.

Peter Gutmann's MDC or the Luby-Rackoff method for constructing a CBC
mode block cipher from hash functions are another way.  However,
Schneier, in AC2 voices concerns about basing ciphers on hashes
because the design goals for hashes are different from those for
symmetric ciphers.

I would be interested to discuss the options of combining
cryptosystems so that the resulting cipher is as strong as the
strongest of the used ciphers.

For instance ways to combine IDEA, 3DES, and MDC say, such that all 3
have to be thoroughly broken before the combination is broken.

How good is simple multiple encryption:

	C = IDEA( key1, 3DES( key2, MDC( key3, M ) ) )

The same question for public key, how good is:

	C = RSA( pk1, ElGamal( pk2, Rabin( pk3, M ) ) )

mixing in a PK system based on a hard problem other than one based on
discrete logs / factoring would be nice also, in case there turn out
to be problems in this area.

Also Schneier has this one:

generate a one-time pad P, XOR it with the data M, then:

	C = IDEA( P ) || 3DES( P XOR M )

generating the pad is left as an exercise to the reader (just
remember, you need at least 112 + 128 bits of security).

Also this has the problem that it doubles the message size, but it is
guaranteed to be as hard to break as breaking both IDEA and 3DES (or
whatever algorithms it is you are using).

Also another problem for all of this, you need really top quality
random number generators, to get full use from your long key length
algorithms.

> Where is a fully functional and secure "stealth PGP"?

PGP stealth 2.01 beta is at: http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/stealth/

It is not release quality.

I've been meaning to fix that for a while now, a release version will
be out RSN.

Do you, or anyone else who is interested see any advantage in having
stealth functionality integrated into PGP, say as a patch for PGP263i
/ mit PGP262?  Not that hard to do, if there's any interest for it to
be integrated.

Zbigniew Fiedorowicz <fiedorow@math.mps.ohio-state.edu> added stealth
and SHA1 support directly to a MAC version of PGP.  The key words `fat
mac pgp' in a www search engine would probably find it.  Or `Zbigniew
pgp'?

Folks working on this?
