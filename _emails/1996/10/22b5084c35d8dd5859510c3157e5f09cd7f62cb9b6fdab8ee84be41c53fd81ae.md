As there is with political donation restrictions generally.  I suppose the 
fig leaf they wrap around this is to buy the cooperation of the candidates 
by matching funds for those candidates who agree to restrictions.  Do the 
laws really prohibit the giving of more than a certain amount of money, or 
just the act of receiving it?

Sure, you can't keep people from talking.  However, one way to sabotage the 
usefulness of telling is to allow everybody else as well to make the same 
claim, with essentially no way for the candidates to tell who is REALLY 
giving the money.  Make the lie just as credible as the truth, and the value 
of knowing the truth is destroyed.  If nobody can trust anyone else's word, 
then no candidate could know who REALLY ought to be rewarded for a campaign 
contribution, breaking the circle of quid-pro-quo.  

The candidate still gets the money, of course, and the contributor is still 
free to both donate and speak...separately.  The thing that's been cut off 
is the association between the money and the speech...which is exactly what 
the problem is, isn't it?

I haven't thought this through well enough to know just how possible such a 
system might be, but this is exactly the kind of goal that cryptography and 
data-blinding functions can accomplish.  Frankly, I'd prefer a more 
effective (and more lethal) solution, but for all those who object to AP, 
here's my alternative plan.
