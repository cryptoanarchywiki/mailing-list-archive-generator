The thing is, *how* exactly are you gonna prevent the advent of e-cash?  The 
same mechanisms that will make a group try to prevent it's apparition will work 
for groups that try to promote it.  Prostitution was virtually always 
repressed.  But was it ever eradicated?  Only, the odds are immensely stacked 
in favour of AP as long as *any* kind of e-$ exists.  Doesn't even have to be 
denominated in dollar, donations could very well be made in ounces of gold...

Well, let's get into that passionnate topic... Many peoples pretend that theses 
pieces of paper are worth nothing *right now*.

But what about gold e-bonds?  You don't like gold? OK, what about a composite 
of precious metals, patented antibiotics, some choosen chemicals, some choosen stock, 
etc, all of them *privately owned* by the issuing bank?

:-) ROTFL!

While some peoples want anarchy, I jsut want peaceful living...

The example of Columbia is completely out of context.  Some dictators were 
replaced by other dictators, both being different sides of the same coin.

In Columbia, any member of the gang of drug cartels could be identified and
get targeted by peaceful citizens the same way they would target politicians. 
AP would thus stop street terror.  AP is not against govt per se, it is
something acting against any opressing "leadership", whomever it might be.  

Jim Bell's conviction being that the human animal is basically a reasonnable
animal that enjoys life, AP, IHHO, will bring a world in which the golden rule
will be "live and let live (or die).... or get killed".  

Here, "live and let live (or die)" is opposed to "live and make die (or live)" 
The operative is *let* versus what we currently have now: "make"

Jim Bell, as it is evident by his writings, believe that the word "freedom"
means "to be free from other men".  In that sense, an I think that I am quoting 
him, he claims that anarchy is not "the lack of order" but rather the "lack of 
orders".
