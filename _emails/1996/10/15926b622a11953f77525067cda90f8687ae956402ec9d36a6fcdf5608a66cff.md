There is a really cool service being offered on the web. It allows
users to trace the paths of trust between two keys in the PGP world.
It is worth checking out:

  http://www.research.att.com/~reiter/PathServer/

This is a good way to find the paths you want in the web of trust.
For example, you can type in your key id, and the key id of a new,
candidate key, and you will find all of the signature paths
from your key to the new key. You'll be surprized at how connected
the graph is.
