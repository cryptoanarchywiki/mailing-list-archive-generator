Windows NT 3.51 is a real operating system.  It is not as secure
as I would like, but it is much better than Windows 3.1, which was
totally insecure.  It has some good security techniques,
but I don't know how secure the networking is, and networking
is the big technical insecurity on most machines today.  
(Well, bad administration is the biggest insecurity on almost all 
machines for almost all time.  And physical security is also big.)

Windows 4.x moves the graphics/windowing system into Ring 0,
where the "secure" parts of the kernel are.  Bad.
This means graphics bugs can make the kernel insecure or crash.
I don't trust it, especially because Windows 3.1 crashes all the time
for me, and stupid bugs make Windows 3.1 behave badly for me.
So if they put the window system in the kernel, I don't trust it.
