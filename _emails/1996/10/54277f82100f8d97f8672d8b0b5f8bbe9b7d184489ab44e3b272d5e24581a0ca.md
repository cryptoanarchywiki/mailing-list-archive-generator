Not seen it either.

2048 bit PGP signatory key, long passphrase conventional encryption.
If you are doubtful of the entropy of the passphrase you could encrypt
with a second PGP public key signed by the first, and simply reveal
the secret key.

Post the message to cypherpunks via a nice long chain of mixmaster
remailers.  (Then you can't be coerced into releasing the key early).

Spoofing is difficult to prevent because anyone can repeat what you
are doing, publish a key, publish the explanatory text and encrypted
message, then post the decrypt key later.

With Tim May's BlackNet key, there were several after the fact
attempted spoofs of it, people publishing other keys with "BlackNet"
as the key id, as a kind of denial of service attack.

Getting a timestamp from a PGP timestamping service on the key, and
also having the encrypted message and explanatory text timestamped
before releasing it would help.  Then people couldn't spoof unless
they knew before hand what kind of topic your release would be about,
so that they could pre-sign a selection to pick from as a spoof.
