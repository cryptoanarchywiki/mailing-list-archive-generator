But would they be able to image identify my
butt when I moon 'em?

(And I'll have none of those "If it could image your face,

 LANGHORNE, Penn., Sept 30 (Reuter) - Digital Descriptor
 Systems Inc said on Monday that it had received the first
 $140,000 phase of a proposed $1.4 million contract from IBM.
     The money is to be used by the Bahamas for the installation
 of imaging identification systems. The first segment of the
 imaging program will be installed in the Bahamas by the end of
 this year.
     Digital Descriptor, in a three-year partnership with IBM to
 create a program needed on a country-wide basis by the
 government of the Bahamas, manufactures and markets imaging
 systems for municipal and private criminal enforcement markets.
