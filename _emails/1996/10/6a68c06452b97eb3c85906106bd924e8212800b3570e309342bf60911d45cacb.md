What about the heuristics of partitioning the keyspace?

Seems to me that a _subset_ of all possible keys is much more likely
to appear than a random selection from an equidistributed population 0..2^56.

(P)RNG's just aren't that likely to produce a key of 010101010.....
nor 001100110011... etc etc and I have been thinking about how one might formalize 
and exploit this randomness property to increase the probability of finding the key sooner.

So a keysearch strategy should be something other than a partitioning of 2^26 into N bins
with a linear search within each bin.  I realize that it is POSSIBLE that a key of 1010101010...
was used, (excluding weak keys from consideration) ---- but I have seen "certifiable" RNG's and,
God Bless 'em, they just dont ever produce anything with any predictability.  

Is not the lack of predictability a predictable, and therefore exploitable, attribute?

Any thoughts here?
