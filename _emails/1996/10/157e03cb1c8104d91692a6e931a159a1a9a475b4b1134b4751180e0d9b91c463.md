I'm still waiting for a briefing from Dorothy Denning, Dave Maher,
and the rest of the Clipper Chip review team on their findings
and a final report :-)  They released a preliminary report,
saying that SkipJack was strong, and never did release a final report
analyzing Clipper itself - the Clipper protocols, the chip itself, 
the master key loading system, or the master key handling procedures
(or if they did issue a final report, they didn't advertise it widely...)
