Being that I totally agree that you get what you pay for in banking,
and have had the opportunity of using a small private bank for 
business some time ago.  What would be your list of best offshore
banks to do business with, Keeping in mind the ease of opening an
account but still getting top notch service?  Bank of Ireland???
