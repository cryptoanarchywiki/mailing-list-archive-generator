side-point:

Somebody mentioned that one of the features in the new go-around is that 
only session keys need to be made available, and warrants will be needed 
for each message to be decrypted.

Doesn't this essentially rule out the use DSS/Diffie Helman based
key-exchanges, or at least diffie-helman with ephemeral paramaters?
