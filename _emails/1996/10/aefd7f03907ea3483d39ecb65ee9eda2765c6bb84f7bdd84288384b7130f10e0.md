You, Rick Campbell, shaped the electrons to say:
+
+So, I just finished watching the debate and at the very end, Bob Dole
+suggested that people check out www.dole-kemp.org.  I was already on
+playing decision96.digital.com so I went for it.
+
+The first page says ``Oops!  You've tried to access the old
+way.  Please choose the new way instead.''  Clicking on `new' gives a
+black background page with two yellow arrows, one left and one right.
+The left one gives you ``Nope, you can't go back now''.  The Right one
+gives you www.cg96.org, the Clinton-Gore home page.


Yeah.... definatly hacked... not much point in mirroring this one.

hmm it goes to www.dole-kemp.com which then sends it to cg96.org......
hmmmm the INTERNIC entry for dole-kemp.com looks find... and its a 
redirect,
so they prolly hacked both sites... not sure... anyone else have any
ideas?


My understanding is that everyone has been fooled.

The addresses www.dole-kemp.com and www.dole-kemp.org seem to be spoofed 
sites.  The REAL sites are www.dolekemp96.org and www.dole96.org.  These 
sites have not been touched.  Hmm, and I thought that internic was supposed 
to be watching this stuff (domain names).  I wonder if mcdonalds.org is 
still available...
