It's nice to hear I was listed as a good guy. Maybe I can regain some 
credit if I explain why I co-published the binding cryptography 
proposal ;-).

I haven't yet made up my mind how the crypto problems for law 
enforcement are to be addressed. It's my Ph.D. subject, and all I can 
say at present is that the issue is complex.

That is why I want there to be as much information on the issue as 
possible. I don't say I agree with key-escrow, GAK or binding crypto, 
nor with demanding a suspect to decrypt, but I want to know all there 
is to know before I make up my mind. 

Having a new proposal helps putting things into perspective. At least 
the binding crypto proposal shows (as other proposals have) that 
there's no need to escrow your private keys, and that's a point.
Also, as I said in my first comments, binding crypto isn't meant to 
solve the crypto problem, it is "merely" meant to provide a 
trustworthy crypto system with some safeguard. 

Finally, to my mathematician's sense of aesthetics, binding crypto 
is an elegant proposal. It merits publication in its own right. Not 
because I think it should be established, but because I think it 
should be known.
