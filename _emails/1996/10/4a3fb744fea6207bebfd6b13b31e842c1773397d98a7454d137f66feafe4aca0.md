:Date: Wed, 02 Oct 1996 08:39:50
:
:It has come to my attention that Cypherpunks no longer allows users of 
:Microsoft browsers to access their archives.
:
:Is it contradictory for an organization who proclaims an interest in the free 
:exchange of ideas through the mechanism of the Internet to limit the exchange 
:of ideas using an individual's software decisions as the criteria?
:
:Are issues of annonymity and privacy and the encouragement of private use of 
:powerful encryption and remailer tools secondary to and less important than a 
:crusade against a software manufacturer?
:
:Should corporate users of the Internet or individuals unable to access the 
:Internet through any other means than corporate or public computers be denied 
:access to information because the computer owner insists on a particular, and 
:freely chosen software package?
:
:Will the Internet continue in the direction of propagating propaganda or will 
:the original rule of releasing all information to the public and letting the 
:public decide be the rule of the Internet?
:
:I, of course, know my own feelings on these issues but want to know how far 
:out of the pale I am.
