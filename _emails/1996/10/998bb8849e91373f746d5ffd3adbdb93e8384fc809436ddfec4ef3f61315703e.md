I don't know if Tim said that as well, but I certainly did. The 
government's move is ingenious. By appropriating the term "key recovery" for GAK, the 
government made it almost impossible to discern between key recovery as 
required in many commercial environments and GAK as required by an 
Orvelian surveillance state.

Yes. What is good for the government and what is 
good for the people will always be opposite.

I agree that true key recovery for the corporate environment is often 
desirable. I do not believe that it will ever have to include an outside 
'escow" agent.

That's me.

The problem is that what the Funding Fathers considered "reasonable" and 
what today's courts consider reasonable have *nothing* in common.

Those who believe that the infringements on our rights can continue for 
all times with impunity are living in a fantasy world. While I am a 
peaceful, non-violent person, an ever increasing number of others feel 
differently. If the government 
continues on the course they are on - and requiring (never mind the 
'voluntary') GAK is doing just that - there will be those who will feel that 
armed resistance is the only option left. I will try everything in my 
power to not let it come to that. Therefore I must oppose GAK.
