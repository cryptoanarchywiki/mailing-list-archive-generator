"Extending credit" refers to the customer's ability not to pay the bill
in full at the end of the cycle, but effectively to borrow money from 
the issuer at a very high rate. Smart people don't use this feature of
their credit cards and pay off in full every month. :-)

Every secured credit card I've ever seen is still a credit card - the
holder maintains an account with a balance equal to his credit limit.
if he defaults on the cc payments, the issuer just takes the money
from the account, so it's a kind of a collateral.

But you don't have to pay in full at the end of the month (or have the
amount deducted from your account at once), which would make it a
charge card or a debit card.

One large card-issuing bank was in the news their other day: they're
using supercomputers for "data mining", analysing the purchases made 
with their creditr cards. Buyer beware.
