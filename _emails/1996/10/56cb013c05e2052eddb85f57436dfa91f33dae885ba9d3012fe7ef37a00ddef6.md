Not quite, 

It is so unlikely that any DES key would exist to turn a one time pad 
encrypted message into an intelligible plaintext with no errors, 
proper linguistic structure etc. that it just wouldn`t wash.

I shiver at the idea of calculating the probability (my statistics is 
a bit rusty) but it is a pretty damn small probability given that the 
set of all possible DES ciphertexts is a smallish subset of all 
possible binary values (if memory serves correctly, I may be off the 
mark here though).

This may work with a stream cipher (which is pretty similar to a OTP 
apart from not being provably secure because the entropy of the key 
is greater than or equal to that of the message) where you can have 
any possible binary value as your ciphertext...
However, for a block cipher, this would appear to me to be impossible 
for most ciphertexts.
