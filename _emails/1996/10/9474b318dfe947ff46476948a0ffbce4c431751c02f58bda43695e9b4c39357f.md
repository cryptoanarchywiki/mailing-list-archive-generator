Dimitri has not told the truth--at least according to the 
"threat" he included, infra.

The "threat" has to do with his postings to this list, not with
his visit to California.  (Dimitri's failure to tell the truth is 
probably not a lie but arises from his limited skills with the
English language.)

Nothing there about visiting California that I can see.

P.S.1	For what it's worth, most Bay Area Cypherpunks 
	are straight.  Some are gay, that's life.  WE
	DON'T CARE.  Privacy is our concern.  

P.S.2	It seems that the only folks who have a real
	fixation on homosexuality are latent homosexuals.  
	Gays and straights who are confident in their own 
	sexuality don't get that worked up about it.
