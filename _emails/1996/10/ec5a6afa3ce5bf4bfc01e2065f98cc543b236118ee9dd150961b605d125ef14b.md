I must say I like the way OS/2's Workplace Shell can crash entirely (doesn't
happen here anymore; did with some really crappy video drivers for an old
Trident 8900) and you can watch while it restarts it (takes about 10 seconds
and didn't bother open apps).   NT's shell seems to be a *little* harder to
screw up, but when it does it goes bigtime.

You lose speed but gain security and stability - the continual operating
sytem tradeoff.
