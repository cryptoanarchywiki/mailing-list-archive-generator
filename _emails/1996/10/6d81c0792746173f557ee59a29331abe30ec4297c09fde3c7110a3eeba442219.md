I did a "who" and didn't see them.  Maybe someone already took care of it...

BTW, the messages I was receiving from "abusebot@savetrees.com" were sent
to me, not the list.  I wrote the address in their email and was told that
apparently someone was forging notes to their "abuse" address from mine --
the information about reporting abuses, etc, comes back in response.  I was
told the messages would be blocked, but I'm not sure if it happened as I'm
now filtering them.
