Yes, a large and widely distributed message pool would seem to be a way 
around this ...

Yes, I suppose the actual transmission would be robust, if no mistakes 
were made. As you pointed out - if you can make the first hop secure (or 
any hop, for that matter).

The only problem is that you're the only one turning up w/ 
a sudden large ecash sumin the Cayman Islands (and that "clue" won't be 
there with wider use of ecash ...).

Perhaps we should write our own script. Can we get Attila to play "El 
Dictator"?
