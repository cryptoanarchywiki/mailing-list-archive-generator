What bothers me about such schemes is this:  What happens if the insecure
machine which accepts your PIN and transfers it to the iButton then
performs a transaction which you have not authorized.  E.g. it transfers
$10 rather than $.01.  You can collect quite a bit by repeating the scam.

I have not heard of a trust protocol which does not require some form of
input and/or output on the iButton itself.  All the ones which can be used
by normal humans (e.g. do not require the user to do public key
cryptography in his/her head) require both a small display and a
approve/disapprove button.  I think the credit card calculator form factor
is attractive for this application.
