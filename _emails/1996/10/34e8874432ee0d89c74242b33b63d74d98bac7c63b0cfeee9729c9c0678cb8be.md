     And you still claim that AP has _no_ moral basis? 

     Is there more than one person using your account? 

     This may get me in a lot of shit, but if anyone _anyone_ treats a member
of _my_ family that way, Ohhhh shit, I'd _never_ get out of jail, assuming that
I make it that far. 

     I am not old enough to have served in Vietnam, but I did serve in the 
military, and I didn't do it to protect scumsucking politicians and shithead
sadist facist police. I did it for the college money, and because at one
point in my mis-guided youth I beleived in the constitution.

     I still think it's a good idea, and I realize that the great one-horned one
is probably right about the courts interpretation of the constitution. I also
realize that they have a certain vested interest in the status quo, and that
they had to _start_ with a certain mindset/attitude to get where their 
interpretations carry the weight that they do.

     I think he was refering to geovernments in general, rather than _just
the US government (although I won't deny that it has happened here) the 
SS in germany certainly used rape and torture, and I'd bet it still goes 
on in certain countries.

     1) You might not live thru it, and if it was legal, then they _might_
be tempted to go just a little too far.

     2) I am really hoping that the above was sarcasm.
