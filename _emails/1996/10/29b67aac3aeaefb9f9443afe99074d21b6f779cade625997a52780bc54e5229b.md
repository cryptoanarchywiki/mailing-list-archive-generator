I never argued that these regulations did not have the force of law.
In fact, I conceded that they did.

Nevertheless, they are not laws.
They were neither debated nor voted upon by our elected representatives.
They can be changed at a moment's notice by the State Department, which takes its' orders from the President. The announcement that prompted Mr. Gibson's editorial did not come from the State Department, who putatively has authority over the ITAR.  Instead, the announcement was made from the office of the Vice President, and begins "President Clinton and I" and speaks throughout of "The Administration's initiative".

_That_ was the distinction that I was making.

FWIW, I was unable to find the announcement on the White House's web server, but it is availiable at <http://www.epic.org/crypto/key_escrow/clipper4_statement.html>


Here is another example (taken from the Clipper debate):

In a paper about privacy and the original Clipper proposal (in 1994) A. Michael Froomkin of the University of Miami School of Law pointed out that since the entire key-escrow infastructure was created by presidential decree, and the proposed key holders were part of the executive branch, the provisions for release of the keys could be changed at a moment's notice by another presidential decree, which need not ever be made public. [ Yo, key escrow dude! Email your key database to wiretappers@fbi.gov, and don't tell anyone! ]

See <http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/6095/articles/froomkin-metaphor/partIC.html#ToC29> for the following quote, and <http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/6095/articles/froomkin-metaphor/text.html> for the entire paper. (It's very long; but suprisingly readable, given that the author is a law professor ;-)
