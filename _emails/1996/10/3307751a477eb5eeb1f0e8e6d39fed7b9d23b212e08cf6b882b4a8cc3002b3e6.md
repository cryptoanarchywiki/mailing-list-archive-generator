   "OURS releases Internet security white paper"

      The new white paper, titled "Recommendations for
      Providing Secure Business Services over External
      Networks," is the industry's first objective,
      comprehensive tool for businesses evaluating security
      options for conducting business -- including
      advertising, sensitive information services and
      electronic commerce -- on unsecured networks, such as
      the Internet.

      It represents the experience and foresight of over 25 of
      the industry's leading information technology users and
      vendors, including: American Express, Chase Manhattan
      Bank, Bellcore, Digital Equipment Corp., Levi Strauss,
      Motorola, Novell, Pacific Gas & Electric, Phillips
      Petroleum, SunTrust Banks and Union Camp as well as
      experts within the industry at large.

      The paper is priced at $49.95 and is available
      immediately by calling the OURS headquarters at
      312/527-6782. The executive summaries of this new white
      paper, and 11 others from OURS, are available for free
      by going to the OURS Web page at http:\\www.ours.org.

We'll get the paper, and if it's worthy, put it on the Web, dirt cheap.
