Why, James, this reads very much like Robert McNamara's best 
and brightest in the Nam glory days, cheerleading the B&B 
gang's gory battles slaughtering the worthless masses for 
vain comfort of the elite Pentagon planners.

I presume you are not a savagely scarred vet, wrecked by 
over-heated ambition of the B&B elite, just another rightly 
ignored McNamara crybaby aged-Whiz Kid.

Take R&R for a long while, you need it. Go to your nearest
VA Hospital and wipe-up bed pans. Then come back to c'punks
and earn your rank, not just flaunt the vanity plates.
