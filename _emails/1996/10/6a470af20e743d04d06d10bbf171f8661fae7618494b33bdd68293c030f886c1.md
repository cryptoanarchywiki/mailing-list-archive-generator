In practice, its easier to use the statement against interest exception to
hearsay.

Of course, going by this standard, it would also be difficult to prosecute
any crime involving, e.g., stock or wire transfers.  This is one reason
why the absolutist and the formalist schools of legal thought were
abandoned.

This is essentially my position, the esteemed objections of Mr. May noted
for the record.

I think better discretion than reliance on the ability of others to learn
forgiveness.

Adopt a pseudonym, if you haven't already.  :)
