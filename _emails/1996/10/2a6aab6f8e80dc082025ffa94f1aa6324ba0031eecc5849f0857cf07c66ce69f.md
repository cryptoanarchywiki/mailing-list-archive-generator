Not like it matters.  Have you ever looked at how many machines are on
nsa.gov?  Its not a really big number.  Actually, its 1.  The *only*
machine on nsa.gov is gary7.nsa.gov, aka www.nsa.gov, which is run by
bbnplanet.com anyway.  The rest of the NSA machines are on ncsc.mil (or
some other .mil)
