I really don't see how that's possible, given the possibility of me
taking my laptop to Ecuador, dialing into a stateside ISP, and being
issued an IP address in the ISP's domain.  In other words, anything
that bases a decision on host location by inference on the domain 
will inherently be rooted in the notion that hosts in that domain are
stuck to the ground "nearby".
