Fascinating, isn't it?  Whatever they're trying to protect me from I'm 
not getting, I'm only getting their trash. Better to just filter it out.

And speaking of being "protected" by the system, did anyone notice the 
several hundred billboards around L.A., all solid black background, with 
large white letters (all caps) that say "STILL GUILTY"?

I drove up Crenshaw from the 405 to Wilshire, and saw maybe 15 or 20 on 
Crenshaw alone.  Looks like somebody's trying to start a war (Simpson 
case, no doubt).
