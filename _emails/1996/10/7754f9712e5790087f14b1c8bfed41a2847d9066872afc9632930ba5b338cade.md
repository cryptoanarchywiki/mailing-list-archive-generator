A quickie post-debate-update from the oddsman.

Looks like Ladbroke House is still heavy on Clinton, with prices
the same as last time, William Hill and Ladbroke's have now agreed
on a {bearish} number for Dole, but the strange disparity in Perot
odds remains. The oddsman still seeks a Moscow correspondent for
UK arbitrage opportunities. Possible nym soon, so stay tuned.

The oddsman's roving reporter can't get any reply on the phone from
Coral, so they may be out of the running on this year's horse race.
I'll keep you posted -- 'till next post-time.
