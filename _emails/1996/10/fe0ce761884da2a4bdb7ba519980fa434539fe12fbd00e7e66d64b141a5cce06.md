   This is to announce the release of premail 0.45, an e-mail privacy
tool for Unix. The major new feature is support for the nym.alias.net
style nymservers. Most of this code was contributed by the admin of
nym.alias.net. Thanks!

   Other than that, it's a minor maintenance release. Several small
bugs have been fixed. Thanks to all who wrote in with bug reports.
