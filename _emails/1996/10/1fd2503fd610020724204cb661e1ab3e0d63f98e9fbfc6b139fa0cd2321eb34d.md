     10-7-96. NYP:

     "Seymour Cray, Computer Industry Pioneer and Father of the
     Supercomputer, Dies at 71." Markoff

          "I was fortunate in having an instructor at the
          University of Minnesota who was looking after me in the
          sense that when I said, 'What's next?' he said, 'If I
          were you, I'd just go down the street here to
          Engineering Research Associates, and I'd think you'd
          like what they're doing there." The company was doing
          contract work for the Navy in cryptography. Mr. Cray's
          first supercomputers permitted researchers to crack
          enemy codes.
