Yes, but how would you know the TRP was telling the truth?  Also
asking the TRP is an online protocol with respect to the TRP.

The paper suggests that in one plausible implementation, the checkers
referred to could be network service providers:

from the summary of the paper posted here:
: The idea is that any third party, e.g., a network or service provider,
                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: who has access to components 2, 3 and 4 (but not to any additional
: secret information) can: 
: a. check whether the session keys in components 2 and 3 coincide; 
: b. not determine any information on the actual session key.

This would allow for instance for a software only implementation of a
madatory key escrow system.  The government in question could then
deputize ISPs to do their mandatory GAK compliance checking for them.
(Deputizing companies is a recent trend in law enforcment techniques
anyway).

This would allow for instance IP level encryption, with non-conforming
encrypted packets being dropped by all ISPs in the country in
question.  Something the Singaporeans might find useful.  The checking
functionality could also be added to a key escrow enabled router.

For this kind of application, binding cryptography is spot on.
