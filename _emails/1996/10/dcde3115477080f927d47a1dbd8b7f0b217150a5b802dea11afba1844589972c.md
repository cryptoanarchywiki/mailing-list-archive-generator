No, I don't. I've heard it all before. I'm not interested in what you or 
anyone else believes from a religious point of view - with regards to 
this list. That's your business. What I object to is the automatic pigeon 
holing that takes place the minute someone openly questions the religion 
of scientific method. Suddenly one's percieved personal beliefs come 
under negative scrutiny with the presumption that the accusor need not 
answer to the same - because they are defending truth, honor and the 
faith. Historically, it used to be called the Inquisition.

Pseudo-scientific? in what regards? Is Geophysics pseudo-scientific? Is 
geology pseudo-scientific? I've been paid well to persue seismic studies, 
plus other geological persuits under both categories for several years, so 
I think I can argue the venue on the merits of accepted operation without 
having to drag religion into it. Secondly, having some passing familiarity w
ith Alan Olsen's background, I am not aware of any paid or unpaid 
experience in these fields of expertise.

No thankyou. Take this private if you want to persue it further.

Crypto - in an oblique manner, it hints at the blinders scientists can 
unwittingly place upon themselves in persuit of a goal - especially when 
that goal involves tenure. Publish or perish. Instituitonal offerings 
many times can be inferior to private persuits for just that reason alone.

privacy  - this is what's at stake every time you use crypto. Can you 
trust your tools?

personal freedoms - a broad issue that covers much more than just crypto. 
How much history do you know? That more than anything else will determine 
how willing you are to fight for your freedoms, and how fast you will be 
willing to give them up.

Mormons - nothing.

....Paul
