Obligatory AP solution:

If Netcom and every other telecommunications company doing business in 
Massachusetts were to pool their money, say a half a year of their normal 
payments, they could (in effect) buy an "AP Insurance Policy" which would 
guarantee that they wouldn't have to pay the tax...forever.

Since Netcom is a known entity, all they'd have to do is to announce 
publicly that they are not going to pay the tax because they don't believe 
they owe it, but that they are going to allocate a certain proportion of its 
gross receipts into a fund to disable the tax collection...by "other 
means"...if it was ever tried.  This would have to be a rather powerful 
deterrent to any state attorney considering opening up this can of worms.
