        after I figure out how to allocate the $400+ it takes to get 
    out of here --the disadvantage of living nowhere: $119 each way
    just to deal with SLC for transfer plus SLC to SFO/SJO

        it's too late in the year to even consider crossing the sierras
    on my chopper, ...other than airplane, the sole means of transport.
    
        sold my category D twin tprop since I do not have a valid 
    medical endorsement from the FAA  or the required certified 
    copilot for Cat II or IIIA landings if SFO is pure blind slop.  
    so, it's commerical time.

        so far, being in the high desert away from population in an
    enclave of 100 families as ornery as I, has been a blessing. 

        travel had become more than old.

        hopefully you can make this one hang together --particularly,
    if I can be the roastmaster --and choose the panel...  <g>
