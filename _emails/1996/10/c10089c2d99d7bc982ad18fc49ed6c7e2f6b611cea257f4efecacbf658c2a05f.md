This indicates exactly our difference of opinion, which I noticed 
already in my posting. We have different views on governments, so be 
it.

If you can tell me exactly how criminals can get around the 
cryptographic protocol in the way the proposal tries to prevent 
(unilateral fraud), I very much would like to hear so. If you mean 
criminals can agree to use superencryption (or PGP for that matter), 
I don't deny that, as you might have noticed.
