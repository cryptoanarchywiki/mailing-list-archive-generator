>1) is there a system that can handle unix, windows and mac filenames
>
	Yes. Use Rock Ridge extensions. That will allow for long UNIX
names. If you couple it with ISO9660 youget both worlds.

	Caveats: Macs don't accept RR. Hell!

	Solution: Use level 2 (32+32) names.

	Problem: that's OK for VMS and perhaps Macs, but not for PC's.

	Solution: Use level 1 (8+3) ISO.

	That's easily done with the tools for Liux/Unix. I used them when
I created my personal Crypto-CD a year ago. You tell the program to use
Rock Ridge and convert all names to 8+3. That gives you a double directory
hierarchy, one that's compatible with everything (8+3) plus one that
allows long names (RR).

	If only Macs supported RR...

ObCrypto:

	Have you considered the possibility of filling the unused portion of
the disk with random noise from a good source? Some people could find it useful
even if it is only for trial/test purposes.

	And, is there any possibility of making an international version of
it?
