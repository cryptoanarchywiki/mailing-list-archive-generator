Ha ha ha! Timmy May really lost it. Now he spams this mailing list with
"anonymous" rants, praising himself in third person. He is pathetic.

I'd almost feel sorry for Timmy May if he weren't such an ignorant, arrogant,
obnoxious, loud-mouthed jerk.

Timmy May doesn't know shit about cryptography. He wouldn't know a public key
cryptosystem from a man-in-the-middle attack if one of them bit him on his ass.

Timmy has no life. That's why he floods this mailing list with his stupid
off-topic rants.
