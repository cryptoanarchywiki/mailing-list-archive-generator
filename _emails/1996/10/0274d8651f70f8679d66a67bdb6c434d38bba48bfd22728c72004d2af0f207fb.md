Does that fix the "export only the signature" problem (for the 
government)/opportunity (for the rest of us)?   You know, present Microsoft 
with the software, don't tell them it's already out of the US, and they sign 
it.  Export the signature only  (who cares if this is legal!) and edit the 
international software to contain the signature.
