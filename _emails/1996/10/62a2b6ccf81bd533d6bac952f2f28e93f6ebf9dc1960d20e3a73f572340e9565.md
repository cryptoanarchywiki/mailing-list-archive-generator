It's remarkably hard to erase modern magnetic media. (High coercivity means
field strengths have to be high, and magnetic heads are typically very
close to the media.)

No HERF, HAARP, or other Buck Rogers gizmo is going to even partially erase
floppy disks, let alone Winchester disks inside cases (their own cases,
plus the  outer enclosures). RF leakage is not at all the same thing as
kiloguass magnetic fields (and, more critically, the flux reversals per
unit length).

What the damage vectors might be, such as electrostatic discharge
("sparks"), or dielectric breakdown of oxides, or latchup, are covered in
various conferences, such as the Nuclear and Space Radiation Effects
Conference.

Personally, I think there's a lot of hype about this whole "infowar" thing.
Sure, security measures and vulnerabilities always need to be looked at,
but a lot of the rhetoric is being driven by journalists looking for lead
stories.
