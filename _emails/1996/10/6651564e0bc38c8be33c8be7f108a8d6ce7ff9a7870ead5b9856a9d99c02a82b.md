As best I can figure, extracting the secret from a Mondex card gives you not
merely the money from the card, but the "digital plates" with which to mint
arbitrarily much more money. I only say this because the only protocol the
I can think of that fits what we do know of Mondex has this problem. This fault
does not plague Chaum cash.

I don't know how to code the card application so that a transient errors
won't just occasionally cause the secret to be exported. Then again that
may be possible to code it for "fail safe". If it were my money backing
the Mondex cards, I would want to know how it worked.
