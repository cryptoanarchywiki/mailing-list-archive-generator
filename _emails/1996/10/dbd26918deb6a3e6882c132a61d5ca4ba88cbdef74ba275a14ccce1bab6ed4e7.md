[many things on "fraud"]

Excuse me if I don't react on this in detail. We have already 
explained it, and there it stands: fraud means playing a game without 
abiding by its rules. It's perfectly legitimate to establish a game 
and to introduse rules of the game with it. If you want to play the 
game, play by its rules, otherwise don't play it. If you play it 
while cheating, though, you must bear the consequences ("go directly 
to jail" ;-).
