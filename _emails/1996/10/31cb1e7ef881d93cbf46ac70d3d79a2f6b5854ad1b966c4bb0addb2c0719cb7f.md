Be careful about the Wild West analogies.  Current theory is that contrary 
to what Hollywood cooked up for our movie-viewing pleasure, it was a rather 
peaceful place most of the time.  If anything, the reason that certain 
incidents (OK Corral) were so memorable is that they were, likewise, rare.

I would be far more worried about "mistakes" if I hadn't already thought 
through it, and concluded that abuse and misuse and errors would be strongly 
deterred by the very structure of the AP system.  It will most easily attack 
who coerce the most people, for example politicians, bureaucrats, and some 
government employees in general, precisely because the cost will be shared 
among hundreds or thousands.  It will also fairly easily get rid of "common 
criminals," since most people have been a victim of crime at some point in 
their lives and would be willing to pay to prevent this in the future.  
However, using AP to attack undeserving people will be difficult precisely 
because it would be rather expensive, since the cost will presumably not be 
shared.

True, it isn't any kind of centralized coercive control, but it is a 
excellent form of control, somewhat analogous to the "invisible hand" 
concept of free markets.  The problem is, it's difficult for some people to 
comprehend the kind of distributed-control that free markets represent.

There is a powerful limitation as to how much one individual can manipulate 
the system, as I've previously described...  And besides, the problem you 
describe already exists:  Gang-related murders are an example.   AP would 
eliminate the gangs, at least to the extent that they are a threat to others.

I'm afraid yours is a vastly distorted question.    Let's go back to the 
beginning, shall we?  I've claimed that AP will:

1.  Eliminate war and militaries.
2.  Eliminate government and taxes.
3.  Eliminate dictatorships and political tyranny.
4.  Drastically reduce crime and the costs of crime.

Add all this up, and presume that I think it's a good thing (I do) and how 
can you claim that this is not "a single social moral fiber"?

Sure, you could claim that AP won't do these things, or not all of them, or 
not very well.  I happen to believe it will.  Even if you're partly right, 
at most you have a challenge to my judgment, not my morality or sincerity.

What, exactly, is wrong with a society without leaders?  Do we NEED leaders? 
 I understand that people have probably gotten so used to the concept of 
having leaders around that its hard to imagine the alternative, but you're 
going to have to do better than this to support the existence of leaders.

This may sound odd, but what is there wasn't any news to report?  Maybe 
that's exaggerating things a bit, there will always be weather and the 
occasional accident and other events.  But watch the news for a while, and 
notice what a large fraction of it is government-related, politics-related, 
war-related, coercion-related, etc.

It's unclear why you think AP will prevent this?

Is this line of argumentation a throwback to the "we've got to have a 
dictator!  How else will society operate?"

BTW, in an AP society Vietnam couldn't ever happen, for at least a dozen

No, I won't.  But I will be happy to help eliminate that rot.

"Laws" will no longer be enforced, it's true.  However, legitimate interests 
will be defended and intiation of force will be punished.
