	I seem to recall someone predicting that China and other such countries
would set up an internal net with strict controls. Good prediction... I wouldn't
be surprised to see Cuba recruited to it, for instance, although North Korea
doesn't appear likely (too insular).

	I've about concluded that we'll see a Web dominated by two languages -
English and Japanese. It's very hard for native speakers of Indo-European
languages to learn Japanese, it's very hard for native speakers of Japanese
to learn English, and no other such language has a prosperous-enough home
country to work. Such internal nets may alter this, however...

[...]

>   Unlike the open-access Internet, CWW was modelled on internal company
>   networks or "intranets," Edelson said.
   
>   "There will be a lot of real-time information available," he said. "I

>   China Internet would enjoy free use of Xinhua's communications network

	Heavily edited domestic economic information...

	Ah, yes, the old claim of cultural difference to try to justify
censorship. So Nazi Germany was due to a cultural difference?
