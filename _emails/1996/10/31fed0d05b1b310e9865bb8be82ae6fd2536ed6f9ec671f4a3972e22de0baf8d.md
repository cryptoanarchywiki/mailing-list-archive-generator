The problem was with the seed; it was especially vulnerable to attacks
from somebody running on the same machine. Sufficient entropy is now
obtained during initialization and the PRNG is reseeded reasonably often
during execution. For the Navigator, this is every time the user event
loop cycles.

A pointer to the fixed code was posted to cypherpunks last year.
