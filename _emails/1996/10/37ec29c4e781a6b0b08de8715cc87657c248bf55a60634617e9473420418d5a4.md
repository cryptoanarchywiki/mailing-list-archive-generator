Although we're (allegedly) governed by the Constitution, the principles 
contained in the DOI have precedence.  With issues such as modern 
National Security (in a nuclear age, etc.), where certain aspects of the 
Constitution seem to get skirted or excepted for The Greater Good, you 
might want to include the DOI in your analysis.
