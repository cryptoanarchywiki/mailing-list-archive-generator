Armenia couldn't have entered the war because it wasn't an independent state.
It surely would have been an Axis ally if it could.  However tens of thousands
of Armenians volunteered to fight for the Nazis and to help kill the Jews.

The "incident" at Pearl Harbor was provoked by the U.S. oil embargo on Japan,
which was viewed as a declaration of war by the Imperial government, who said
so before commencing hostilities.  You should stop repeating U.S. propaganda
and learn some historical facts.  Remember how the U.S. bombed the hell out
of Iraq and murdered thousands of people over a much less crucial oil source?

(I suppose the use of census data to ferret out the unfortunate Japanese and
to ship them to concentration camps makes this somewhat crypto-relevant. :-)
