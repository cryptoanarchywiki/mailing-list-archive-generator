The recent posts about GPS made me research the state of the art of GPS 
receivers. Seems they are getting pretty good. Two pounds, sub-meter 
accuracy, attitude determination, all at altitudes up to 60,000 feet and 
speeds up to 1,000 nmph. But what really caught my eye was the fine print 
at the bottom of the spec sheet:

"Higher altitude and velocities up to 25,000 nautical miles-per-hour 
options are available in the U.S."

I gather from this that as long as you are in the US, you are welcome to 
use this technology for applications that require larger than 1,000 nmph 
speeds.

Seems the software industry is not the only industry that's suffering 
from silly export control laws.
