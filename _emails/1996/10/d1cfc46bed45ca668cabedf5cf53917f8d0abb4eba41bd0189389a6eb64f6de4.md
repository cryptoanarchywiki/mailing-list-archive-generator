   "U.S. Considers Slugging It Out With International
   Terrorism"

      Officials contend that the main threat now comes from a
      murky network of home-grown, privately financed and
      largely independent groups forming a kind of
      international "terrorists' Internet." That network is
      proving extremely difficult for U.S. intelligence
      agencies to locate and penetrate. "Today's terrorists
      don't have to depend that much any more on states for
      access to financing or the technological means."

   "Postal Service Plans to Leave Its Mark on Electronic Mail"

      Cylink is developing a system for electronically
      postmarking and encrypting computer messages and Sun and
      Enterprise Productivity are developing software that
      will allow bulk mailers to calculate the price of mail
      shipments on the Internet. The Postal Service predicted
      that the new system ultimately will account for $5
      billion in postage a year, about 9 percent of all
      postage.
