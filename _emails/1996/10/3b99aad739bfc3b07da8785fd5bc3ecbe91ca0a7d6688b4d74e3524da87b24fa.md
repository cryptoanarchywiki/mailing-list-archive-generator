The attacks on FEAL are pretty lengthy.  _Applied Cryptography_ 2nd edition
by Bruce Schneier has a list of attacks on page 311.  The Shamir attack is
not the one to worry about.  Matsui and Yamagishi have an attack that
breaks it in 2^15 known plaintexts.

If you do not have a copy, I can dig up the references on it.  (It is too
late/early for me to do it clearly at this point...)

Hope that helps.
