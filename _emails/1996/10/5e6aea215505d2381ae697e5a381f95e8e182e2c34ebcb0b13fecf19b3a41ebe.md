>   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the bill

	Translation: now that we're no longer using Communism as the
standard threat to justify stuff, we'll use terrorism et al.
   
>   The bill:
   
>   --Gives the FBI power to subpoena local telephone records.

	Remind me to use pay phones.
   
>   --Authorizes the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security
>   Agency to collect data on foreign citizens for U.S. investigations.
   
>   --Requires Senate confirmation of the CIA's general counsel. That is
>   meant to prevent political influence over a position designed to block
>   illegal covert operations.
