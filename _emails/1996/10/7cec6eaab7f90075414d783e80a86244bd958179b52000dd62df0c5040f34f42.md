Front page of the Technology Post section of the 15/10/96 edition
of the South China Morning Post, next to a cheesy photo of the two
men quoted in the article looking (peering?) through venetian blinds.

Headline: Anonymous e-mail site launched.

Byline: Keala Francis

Highlights:

"Hong Kong advertising agency Momentum has created an anonymous
e-mail service for Internet users around the world."

penet closed down "because it was perceived to be condoning child
pornography. [Director] Tobin said PINmail (http://www.PINmail.com)
was designed as an offshore address only for legitimate businesses,
but the compay could not necessarily control its users."

Tobin: "If there is proof of illegal activities, I would give up a
name."

"Momentum created and owns shares in AsiaFocus International, which
owns PINmail."

Access via Netscape 3.0. IExplorer due before December. (Uses CGI and
Javascript in a way that is incompatible with IE3.0.)

Daley (Momentum GM): "There are really no disadvantages to having
your e-mail sit on a server rather than your PC."

"PINmail can also allow you to maintain an anonymous address."

"Momentum has set up three server sites in Hong Kong, California and
Amsterdam to enable easier and more efficient access."

PINmail = USD19.95/yr.
