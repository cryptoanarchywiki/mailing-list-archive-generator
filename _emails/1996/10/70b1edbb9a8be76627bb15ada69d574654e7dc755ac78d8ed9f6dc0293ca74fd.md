In actual fact, most public officials profess (if not practice) a belief in
an 'absolute right to privacy.'  That is, they profess opposition to
torture.  They believe that coercion for testimony should be limited to two
years imprisonment (or less).  There is no *official* pro-torture lobby in
America (though in practice torture does occur).  

We've already established that they believe in an absolute right to
privacy, we're just arguing over how far beyond the brain that extends.
And since we control our brains and we control our i/o we can probably
expand that zone of privacy in practice.

My "Brain Tennis with Dorothy" post of a few weeks ago expands on this
argument.
