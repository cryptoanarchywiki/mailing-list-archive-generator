Agreeded.  I was assuming some degree of competence on the part of the ISP.
 Since it is a service they are offering, they are responsible for its
correct operation.  Reducing the size of the data you must lose is quite
valuable.  It means you don't have to pass large amounts of tape to stomp
on the file.

The article offers some solution to this problem, as I remember, but I
don't really have time to re-read it and summerize (unless you want to
outbid my current client :-).
