There are several such programs.  The general term is "Steganography",
which means "hidden writing", so you'll see programs with names like
stego, jsteg, mandelsteg, etc.  Look in the usual archive locations
such as ftp.ox.ac.uk and ftp.funet.fi.  Also, for Romana Machado's
stego programs, look at her home page on www.fqa.com.

It's not an _excellent_ alternative, but if it's all you can get,
it's all you can get.  It helps to use encryption algorithms that
don't have special forms, e.g. don't begin with "----- BEGIN PGP"
or other easy-to-spot headers, don't limit their output to printable ASCII,
and (tougher) don't have other subtleties such as the statistical
properties of RSA keys or checksums that can be tested without decrypting.
There's been a lot of discussion on the subject here, and there are
some stealth-PGP versions that obscure PGP's form.

One difficulty with stego'd encrypted data is that it's tough to use
it for applications like encrypting voice between your cellphone and
the cellphone company, since _they_ won't be implementing it.

One suggested place to stash encrypted data is in the low bits
of compressed voice on an internet phone product.  It's difficult -
you need to pick a voice compression algorithm that has room to
substitute bits without messing up the voice quality a lot,
which means you need to work closely with the compression algorithm.
For 64kbps PCM, this is easy (some of the T1 standards already do this
to send signalling bits, which is why data is often limited to 56kbps.)
ADPCM and Delta Modulation can probably handle it fairly well, though
they're generally used only down to speeds of 16 kbps.  Tighter compression
algorithms have less room for noise, are much more sophisticated,
require much more computation, and are probably a lot tougher to use,
but they're where most of the internet phone products are.

And then there are applications like CU-SeeMe (low-speed video conferencing)
which are generally flaky enough that you could toss in the occasional
stego frame and blame it on your cheapo camera or the overloaded reflector :-)

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
  and the politicians had to count them all.
