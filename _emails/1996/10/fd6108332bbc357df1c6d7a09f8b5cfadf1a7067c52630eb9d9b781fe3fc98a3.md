     You mean like Cash? The (in the US) green stuff that can be transfered 
with _no_ ID? That you can use to go down to the local convience store and 
get a money order with to send across state lines thru the US mail?

     Nah. Can't imagine what would happen with something like that.

     No, you DON'T have to. Laws make criminals, and Laws restrict freedom. 
Any law put into place to _prevent_ crime actually does the opposite. In 
what, 1907? Congress criminalized certain drugs (canabis & cocaine and some 
others) what was previously legal became a crime, and it's practicioners 
criminals. 
     If Congress criminalizes Crypto, I and others on this list will become
criminals. We will _become_ criminals to "stop" crime, and others will give
up their freedom to "stop" us from commiting "criminal" acts. 

     Your biggest fallacy (vis a vis crypto) is that criminals will _follow_
the law. They won't by defination, execpt as needed for their schemes. That
is why they are called criminals, because the commit CRIMES, not because they
follow the law.

     The lock is there to stop criminals. The registration _plate_ is there
to allow the government to collect Taxes, and track people. There are serial
numbers on cars used in theft _recovery_ rather than theft prevention.

     The middle is defined by the extremes. I'd take the most extreme possible
stance, execpt that it is where I already stand, that the government is an
_barely_ necessary evil, and needs to be made an unnecessary evil ASAP.

     If you had _no_ lock at all, and locks weren't avaiable, guess what?
Your bike would get stolen _less_ often because you wouldn't let it out of 
your sight (well, I wouldn't let _mine_, but I spent a LOT of money (for me) 
on mine, so...) 

     And no, a lock isn't 100%. Nothing man made is. Nothing natural is.

     Ask yourself this, given a foe with more resources than you, can 
you keep him _out_ of a given computer system? Not totally.
