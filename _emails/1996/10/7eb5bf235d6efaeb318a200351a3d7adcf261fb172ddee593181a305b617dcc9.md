A really _fine_ post!  I'm also impressed by the way they announced it
just _after_ Congress ended its session, while they're busy losing the export
level in court.

On the other hand, boycotts aren't particularly useful, when 
RSA (who is or is not joining the Bad Guys) owns half the public key patents and
Cylink (who definitely is) owns the other half.  If you're selling public key,
you've got to pay the Bad Guys, until the DH patents expire in 97 (later for
RSA.)
Or you've got to buy from somebody who's paying the Bad Guys.

And the Bad Guys Unindicted Co-Conspirators' announcements haven't even
_mentioned_ permitting export of public key technology (since 56-bit RSA
doesn't quite make it.)  But they _could_ export Kerberos, with only
minor hacks needed to implement Key Ripoff.
