Security First Network Bank officially opened just over one year ago
(they had their one year anniversary this past Thursday).
SFNB actually had been on-line about 4 months before that
(I helped with their security when I was with a different company).
SFNB was the first Internet-only bank.

SFNB is planning on opening some bricks + mortar branches which
means that, technically, AIB's press release may be correct
(only "Internet-only" bank), but it will be a couple of months 
before AIB is actually on the Internet. According to local 
newspapers AIB is only available through AT&T's
network - it will be a couple of months before they are on the Internet.
