        (RSA Signatures, Blind RSA Signatures, The Schnorr Algorithms, 
         Schnorr identification, Schnorr Signature, Blind Schnorr
Signature, 
         Chaum-Pederson Signature, Implementations of the Schnorr
Protocols) 
  3.3  Summary of Proposed Implementations

Section 4.  Optional Features of Off-Line Cash 
  4.1  Transferability 
  4.2  Divisibility 
 
Section 5.  Security Issues 
  5.1  Multiple Spending Prevention
