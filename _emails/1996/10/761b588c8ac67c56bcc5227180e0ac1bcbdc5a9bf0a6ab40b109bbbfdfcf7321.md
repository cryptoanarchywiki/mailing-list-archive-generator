The two aren't mutually exclusive.  I suspect the government plans to buy
lots and lots of GAK'ed products that come out of this consortium.  Not only
will this sweeten the pot for otherwise reluctant companies, it will also
help make the products the defacto standard.

In any event, the things that caught my attention most were the date
(October 1), and the phrases "Export controls as they apply to encryption
and security products", and "Public policy issues of cryptography and Key
Escrow".
