please elaborate.

I find it as ludicrous as you do, but it's the clear insinuation
suggested by hard-core cypherpunks / anarchists in this forum.

I said, "at least it is rarely quoted here", lawyer-boy.

nevertheless, you might not come off as so utterly condescending
and self-pretentious if you gave even the slightest smidgeon
of a reference yourself, instead of preferring to insult a poster.

>I propose you go to the library and do your own work for a change.

I propose you try to show some civility in cyberspace for a change.

>I wonder what caused you to think this was some kind of novel revelation.

I wonder why you always revert to sarcasm instead of making
constructive points.

there are no claims, merely ideas as usual. I am not posting to 
show off my pretentious laywer skills. the cpunks have you for that.

"your work"? apparently it is "my work" to research case law involving
wiretapping now? hmmmmm, my job description must've changed again
while I wasn't looking. @#$%%^&* don't you hate it when that happens!!

Unicorn, instead of posting something that is so utterly devoid of
any informational value, and merely tries to invent new and clever
ways of tangentially, scurrilously insulting someone without directly
addressing a single actual point
involved, why don't you do the obvious and use the
post as a leaping off point to show off your own mastery of the
arcania and minutia of our legal system, such as it was intended?
do you really think you are getting reputation brownie points or
something by doing this? hee, hee.
