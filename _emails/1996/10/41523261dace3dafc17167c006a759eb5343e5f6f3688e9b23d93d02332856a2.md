Graphics bugs will not crash the system since graphics bugs still run in protected mode. (ie bugs in applications that screw up GDI).

Buggy video drivers though can bring the system down. 

But this does not affect security, only stability.

Security in NT can be defeated by any clever, out of work, bored, NT device driver author who brews up a stealth device driver replacement (perhaps a COM port improvement) that could run amok on the file system or basically do anything. Of course, any clever device driver developer is making enough money to not be bored nor even consider writing a backdoor into a driver. Right?
