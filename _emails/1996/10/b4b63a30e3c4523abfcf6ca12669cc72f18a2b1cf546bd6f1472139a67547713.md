Hooray for a great post.  I'd really like to see this person live up to 
his/her words, and killfile (in *every* applicable way) all those 
homicidal bastards, including, but not limited to, Bill Clinton, Lloyd 
Bentsen, Bush, Eagleburger, Scowcroft, Summers, Reno, Freeh, Deutsch, 
and so on.  Kill(file) 'em all, and let God sort 'em out.  Heh heh.
