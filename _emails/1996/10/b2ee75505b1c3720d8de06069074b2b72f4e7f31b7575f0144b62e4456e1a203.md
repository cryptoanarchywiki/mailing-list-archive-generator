scandals=unwarranted media hype.

True scandals of interest to the investment & banking community are along the lines of fraud, theft, embezzlement, poor or risky investment. Items that directly relate to 1 & 2. The S&L debacle in the US during the 80's is a good example.

The rest is just crap to either:

A: Sell more newspapers, and/or

B: Increase government power.

What about the cost to Switzerland's banking industry due to the fact that they nolonger uphold their investors anonyminity?? Their industry has lost Billions due to their cow-towing to US and other governments snooping into investors accounts. What "cost" does that have to the account holders of their banks??

>And if customers are unconcerned about elements ther than #1 and #2,

Because it is justified by avoiding government interference in their financial activities which in the long run increases their rate of return well above the added cost of doing so.

>> The rest of it is a bunch of Govenment & Media hype & bull shit!!

>The above incidents are easily found with a quick trip to the library.

<sigh> Why so I can re-read the unwarranted media & government attacks on banking institutions because, god forbid, they actually took someone's money without running them over the coals first. Dam those nasty banks all to hell, they don't report every transaction of their investors to every government that may be interested.  

>The bottom line is that until anonyminity is not seen as some kind of

No the bottom line is money is money. Their is no such thing as "legitimate" or "illegitimate" money. Banks should not be forced to play policemen, their job is processing money.

Next time, get a CLUE.

>Next time, stick to web consulting.
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Who died an made you god of the banking industry?? Last time I looked Walter Wriston was still alive and well. :) (Incase you are too clueless to know who that is I am sure a trip to your local library should help.)
