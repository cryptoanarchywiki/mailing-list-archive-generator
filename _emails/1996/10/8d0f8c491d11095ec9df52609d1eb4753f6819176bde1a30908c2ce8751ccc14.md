We would all do well to remember Sturgen's Rule.  For those of
you who do not know the story, Theodore Sturgen(sp?) is/was a 
noted science fiction writer.  At a science fiction convention
some years back he began a speech by saying, "Ninty percent of
all science fiction is crap!"  

The audience was stunned into absolute silence by his blasphemy.  
After a pause of several beats, Sturgen quietly added, "Ninty
percent of EVERYTHING is crap."

Cypherpunks should take pride in having a crap content of only 
seventy-five percent.  Keep up the good work folks.

You're an adult, Dave.  You'll have to do that yourself (and no
whining, okay?)
