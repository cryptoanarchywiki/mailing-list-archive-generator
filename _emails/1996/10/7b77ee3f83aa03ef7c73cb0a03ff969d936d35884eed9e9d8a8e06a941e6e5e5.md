It has to do with this: That religion is connected here, because people 
are connected here.  Religion is the people's way, when they're not 
getting precise answers about crypto, to offload their frustration onto 
the/a superior being, who has no such limits.

When the best thing you can say about PGP, the Golden Calf of crypto, is 
that it "may very well" or "probably will" protect your messages from 
scrutiny by the NSA et al, you can always fall back on God when they 
come and pick you up to take you to the "family camp", like you've seen 
on so many of those TV docudramas.
