I apologize in advance for this.  I only wanted to comment on the Walter Wriston quote
above.  This is the kind of moronic crap they try to brainwash people with in school.
Didn't Hitler say something relevant like "You come at me with your bibles and etc.,
and I'll come with my tanks and guns, and we'll see who wins." (something like that).
Well, we "won", but it wasn't because "the pen is mightier than the sword", etc.
