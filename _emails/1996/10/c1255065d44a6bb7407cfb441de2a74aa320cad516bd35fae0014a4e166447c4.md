I invite you to study law and with it the doctrine of "plain meaning."

They were thinking in enough detail here.  

Thankfully, along with the title political scientist, Mr. Bell also
never had a calling as an attorney.

"A launch vehicle or payload shall not, by reason of the launching of such
vehicle, be considered an export for purposes of this subchapter."

Focus on "by reason of launching of such vehicle,"

Launching a vehicle alone is not export.  It takes more than launch to
make it an export.  More than the launching is not much.

If they wanted to be as inclusive as you would suggest, they would have
left out "by reason of launching of such vehicle." leaving "A launch
vehicle or payload shall not be considered an export for purposes of this
subchapter."

I do get tired of Mr. Bell's half baked attempts to derail any point I
might make.  I wouldn't find them annoying if they were based in anything
like fact rather than some innane and childish attempt to recover the
credibility he so sorely lost in trying to argue with me months ago.
My only regret is that I was so tolerant and patent that I bothered to
respond to most of his lunacy.

It is "right" in its literal meaning.  You, being anything but a
representative of the public, are wrong in intrepreting it.

One might say the same about the size of the hole in your logic and good
sense.  One would have the advantage of being more accurate in this
instance as well.
