This may have already been posted, but I found it interesting...

from: http://www.aa.net/cyber-survival-hq/

     Development of the ALPHACIPHER product line has been voluntarily cancelled
due to the possibility of
                 non-compliance of users of ALPHACIPHER with the new key escrow
law.

   Every key created by a user that would encrypt messages for international
correspondence would have to be
  registered with the US Government. Cyber-Survival-HQ cannot insure that the
users of ALPHACIPHER would
     voluntarily comply with this new law, and so ALPHACIPHER is hereby
withdrawn from the marketplace.

        ALPHACIPHER currently has no built-in key generation function, and the
proposed release of an
 ALPHACIPHER key generator has been terminated. All purchasers of ALPHACIPHER
are entitled to a complete
                               refund, and this has already been done.

         The New ADFGVX cipher is still offered for sale, as it is a breakable
cipher, at least in theory.
