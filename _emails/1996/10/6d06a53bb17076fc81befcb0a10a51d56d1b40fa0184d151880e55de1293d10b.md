So Snow,

Should your parents be (have been) allowed to pass
curfew laws along with the rest of the community
so that their wishes about you not going out could
be enforced?

GAK is for the "common good", after all, it is only the people who are
doing wrong that will be hurt by having their data scanned by the Government,
it is just maintaining decency standards.

     For most of my life I have had insomnia, and when I was in my early
to mid teens, I used to wait until my parents had gone to sleep, and 
go out and wander the neighborhood, Mostly alone, sometimes until 2 or
3 in the morning (during the summer, not when I had to be at school).

     Why _shouldn't_ I be allowed to do this? In my case, it was against 
my parents wishes, but I still harmed nothing, commited no crime (there 
was no curfew where I lived). My father almost caught me (he knew I did it
from time to time, but figured as long as I wasn't causing trouble, he 
wouldn't be able to stop me). Just because other children cause trouble, why
should _mine_ be restricted? Just because it gives the APPERANCE OF MORALITY?

     I'll say that again, THE APREARANCE OF MORALITY. Forcing someone to 
follow a given set of rules doesn't make that person moral, it makes them 
a slave. Morality only comes in when there is choice. 

     Also, the waters are calm on the surface, but what about underneath? 
What is going on behind closed doors? Here in the outerworld, we have 
fornication on the streets, but we know who is doing it, we _know_ who the 
problems are. Do you?

     Almost all teenagers are on their way to a dead end. It is called 
"Adulthood", which if you look at it a certain way looks a lot like 
A Dolt Hood. 

     I don't necessarily think it is a bad idea to mix kids (mid to late 
teens) picked up for "real" crimes in with "real"  criminals, but then
I don't think that staying out late should be a crime. 

     Fear can be a powerful motivator.

     Really, I should be in "the system" because I like wandering around at
night? 
  
     Real libertarian of you.

     Mr. May's usage of "state" means "governing body" rather than "state of
the union". But you knew that. There are many other "interception" points 
that can be utilized to identify children whose parents are not providing 
them with the state approved ideological underpinings, Let's take a look 
at some shall we? 

     Your children do well in school correct? Straight A's in most classes? 
it is obvious that you are driving your children too hard, teaching them tp
be overacheivers. You shouldn't push them so hard, they should stay at the 
level of their classmates. 

     Ok, that was hyperbole. Seriously tho', if you talk to many "social 
workers" <pardon me--*spit*> they can give you certain behavior patterns that
indicate a child is being abused in the home. They could (and I am sure some 
would like to) go so far as to include certain types of religious and political
indoctrination as abuse. 

     If the state (city/county) mandates it, and it gives the apperance of 
"stopping crime", or simply provides a smooth surface, is it worth it?

    Not in your area, and maybe not my LDS's, but try Pell City Alabama.
Same mentality, different name on the church house door.

     Yet you argue for the abridgement of freedoms based on age. Does the 
state know better than a parent when a minor is old enough to be out after
midnight?

     Which really only pisses most people off because it is a different
revisionist history than they want taught.

     Remember, Klinton can't do it without congressional approval.
