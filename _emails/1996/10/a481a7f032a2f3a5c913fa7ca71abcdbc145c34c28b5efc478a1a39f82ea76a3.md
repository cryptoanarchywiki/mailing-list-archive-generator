SOUL CATCHER IMPLANTS

British scientists are developing a concept for a computer chip
which, when implanted into the skull behind the eye, will be able to
record a person's every life time thought ands sensation.

Hahaha!  That's a good one.  Maybe these guys should share some of their 
findings w/ the worlds leading neurologists, since they seem to know so 
much.  "Every lifetime thought"??????  Even one thought.  Hmmm, perhaps 
they would care to explain human emotions in scientific terms, fully 
explained, no vagueness allowed?  Care to share "translation tables" for 
neuro-electric impulses that show signature of certain emotions?  This is 
just so ridiculous.  I would just like to ask them one question.  "How?" 
 Record what someone sees?  Maybe....
