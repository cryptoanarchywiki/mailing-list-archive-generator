There are several cases which refer directly to what you say.  Get off
your fat and go look them up yourself.

Stop asking and start paying lawyers to educate you.  Or sweat through
three years of hell in law school like the rest of us..

Go ahead, but don't complain when I flame my testicals off and call you a
lazy ass because above you have just admitted that you are one.  If you
want lawyers who are going to talk to laymen, try a few ABA dinners.  When
you have alienated each and every lawyer there, come back and beg here
again.

No such animal.

A [hypothetical] civilized lawyer will tell you tell you that you can't do
it as quickly as an uncivilized one.

Though I can only speak with certainty of myself, I think many of the
legal types on the list are tired of typing pages and pages of things only
to have you bring up more innane arguments and demand more cases and so on
and so on.

Witness reputation capital, or debt, in action.

I don't think I would mind so much if a noted and credible source asked me
the same question.  With you I ask, what the hell for?  He can do his own
damn work and will probably post less if he is spending some time in the
library.  It is directly against my interests to make anything easier for
you.

Why when you use the word "wiretap" is it cause for me to get huffy?
Because you are below the level of capital where I will have any part of
supporting or contributing your "arguments."

1>  The Status Quo is so entrenched and useful to law enforcement, that
the likes of EFF will never change it.

Gee, might it be that cryptography cases are a new area of law where
limited resources are better applied because uncertainty in the law is
greater?  Duh.
