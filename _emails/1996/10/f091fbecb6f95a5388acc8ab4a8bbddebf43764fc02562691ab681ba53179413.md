And you all accept this without complaining? (Not you personally,
since you obviously are complaining, at least on this list.)
Aren't students supposed to be rebellious?

Well, then don't go to the sports hall or any social events.
Pay for the beer with cash even if it costs a few pennies more.
And, for Godzilla's sake, don't vote (it won't make any difference
anyway).

Open your own, competing services just outside campus limits.

Try to discredit the system. Spread (false, if so be it)
rumours about the selling of beer-drinking records to future
employers, about you knowing a guy who's father, a devote
Latter Day Saint working in the security department of a bank,
spanked the guy for his outrageous social activities, about
the guy who got unfriendly with a 'hacker' and suddenly ran
a bill for 2000 beers in a week, and so on. Yes, especially
stories about fraud and personal loss of money are good. Such
things scare people.
