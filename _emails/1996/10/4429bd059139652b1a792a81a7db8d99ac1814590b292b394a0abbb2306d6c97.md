To nobody@replay.com (Anonymous):

I will use simple words so you can understand.

My IQ is not 207 but I know BS when I see it.  Too much bravado without
substance.  Too much hot air without mass.  You claim that thermodynamics is
about hot air.  Anyone with a basic course in physics knows that
thermodynamics is not just about hot air.

Present the algorithm and it's proof if you want someone to listen or stop
wasting everyones time with your rantings.

Pat
