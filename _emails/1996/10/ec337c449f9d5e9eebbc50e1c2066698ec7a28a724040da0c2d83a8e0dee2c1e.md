I think you're talking about the definition of "export", located at 22 CFR
120.10:

     "Export means, for purposes of this subchapter:
      (a) Sending or taking defense articles out of the United States
    in any manner; or
      (b) Transferring registration or control to a foreign person of
    any aircraft, vessel, or satellite on the United States Munitions
    List, whether in the United States or abroad; or
      (c) Sending or taking technical data outside of the United States
    in any manner except by mere travel outside of the United States by
    a person whose personal knowledge includes technical data; or
      (d) Disclosing or transferring technical data to a foreign
    person, whether in the United States or abroad; or
      (e) The performance of a defense service on behalf of, or for the
    benefit of, a foreign person, whether in the United States or
    abroad.
*   A launch vehicle or payload shall not, by reason of the launching
*   of such vehicle, be considered an export for purposes of this
*   subchapter.  Most of the requirements of this subchapter relate
    only to exports, as defined above.  However, for certain limited
    purposes, the controls of this subchapter apply to sales and other
    transfers of defense articles and defense services (see, e.g., Sec.
    126.1) of this subchapter."
