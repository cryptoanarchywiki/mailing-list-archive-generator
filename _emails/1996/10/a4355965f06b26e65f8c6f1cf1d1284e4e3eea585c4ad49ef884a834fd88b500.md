Hi Jim!
Could you please tell me where I could find more about it?  Is there a URL
presenting the story?  Did you broadcast the story to other groups?

There is one other thing that you probably saw but did not point out:  At least

here in North America, networks and cables are *privately* owned.  A bit tax
would thus tax the use of private property by it's ownner.  That is going a bit

far!  Also, the only one who could file for fraud is the owner.  Otherwise, I
could file a complaint and charge you for fraud that there are too much fart
marks in your underwear...  Or maybe they could institute a spoon and fork

tax.  Or a comma or alphabet tax, why not since it is in the same line?

This is absolutely absurd and anybody planning such a scheme has *much more*
than innocent intentions in mind.

Ciao
