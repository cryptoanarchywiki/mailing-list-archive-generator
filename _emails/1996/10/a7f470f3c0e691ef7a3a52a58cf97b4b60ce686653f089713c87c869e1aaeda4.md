Relax Derek,

Attila hasn't been bitting you in public over this. Patience is not one 
of his virtues sometimes, but I have never known him to be purposefully 
rude and pushy, unless invited.

I can understand that a 60K line project from the ground up can be most 
tedious exercise; sometimes a real mountain to climb. I've done this dance 
for 17+ years in many venues. However, in terms of volume, you are 
complaining at someone whose last project was 1 million+ lines of code; 
most of which he wrote himself. Volume and 90/10 doesn't impress Attila.

Instead of carping at him out of frustration; why not ask him for some 
help? 

...Paul
