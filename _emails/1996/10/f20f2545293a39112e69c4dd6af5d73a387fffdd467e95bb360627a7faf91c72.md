If your schedule looks anything like mine, you only have time for something if
you make time for it.

If your YES is to be worth anything, you are going to have to make time.
Will you make the time? If not, a NO would be a more honest response.

Ciao,

Never put off until tomorrow what you can put off doing altogether.
