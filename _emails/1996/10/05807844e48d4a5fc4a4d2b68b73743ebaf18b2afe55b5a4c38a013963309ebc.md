56 bits + GAK does generally mean DES/GAK, though RC4/56/GAK is also possible.

One "56-bit" protocol that might be allowable under the new rules is
"something strong with all but 56 key bits revealed", e.g. RC4/128
with 72 bits salt revealed (like the RC4/128 with 88 bits salt revealed that
Netscape uses, or 3-DES with 112 bits salt revealed), which would be 
substantially stronger against cracking than raw 56-bit DES.  
A big advantage is that it makes pre-computation of lists less useful,
since two cyphertexts with the same 56-bit key might be different in the
top N-56 bits of key, and the key schedules are less reusable.
The 3DES version, for instance, also gains because some of the big
DES hooks that let you scrounge a few bits don't work.
