* ELECTRONIC-COMMERCE STANDARDS GROUP FORMED
In a push to encourage online commerce, the Electronic Frontier Foundation
and CommerceNet have teamed up to implement eTrust, a global initiative
that would allow qualified merchants to bear the eTrust logo. The
initiative has thus far formed a standards body made up of such companies
as Coopers & Lybrand, the Firefly Network, and Test Drive. This body,
dubbed the Commercial Guidelines and Auditing Standards Committee, has
developed a series of guidelines for an accreditation program, which the
group will take through a pilot phase towards the end of the year. A
commercial offering and a pricing structure are expected in the first
quarter of 1997. More information is available at http://www.etrust.org.
(Cowles/SIMBA Media Daily 10/17/96).
