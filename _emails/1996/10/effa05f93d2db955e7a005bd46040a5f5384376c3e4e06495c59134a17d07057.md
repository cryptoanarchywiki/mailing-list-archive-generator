"My last reply"?  Sorta the rhetorical equivalent of "I think I heard my 
mommy calling," huh?

Except that "sizeable" donations won't appear.  If you don't understand 
this, you haven't been reading the descriptions of how the system would 
work.  Individual donations won't be identified either by name of amount; 
they'll be accumulated and only approximately reported.

I wonder how many people will still be donating if they can't get their name 
associated with the donation...

And it'll be even less when this system is adopted.

Who needs "national defense"?  As for "information infrastructure, are you 
under the illusion that private industry couldn't do it?  Hell, it DOES it!  
The Internet is essentially fully privatized, NOW.

And "physical infrastructure"?  Sure they'll be physical infrastructure.  
It'll just be _privately_ owned.

The difference between private and public corruption is that in private 
corruption, individuals presumably have the right to fight that corruption 
where it impacts on their rights and assets.  In PUBLIC corruption, the 
taxpayer is rarely given the opportunity to fight the loss of his assets.

It appears that you've convinced yourself that ESP exists and works.  Given 
that, it isn't surprising that you would believe that donations to 
candidates can't be "blinded" sufficiently to help dramatically reduce 
political quid pro quo.

How do you know this?

The winning margin is ALSO clearly less than the number of many different 
identifiable groups.  You seem to be making assumptions in support of your 
theory.

ESP again, I see...

Except that plenty of voting blocks exist.  And there's plenty of unknowns 
that you can't figure out with any certainty:  How certain are you that 
"Block Y" ALL voted for Z?  How do you know some other group didn't?  Etc.

It's pretty close, even if not entirely the "root of all evil."
