Your command:

                             SIGNOFF COOL_TRAVELS

has remained unconfirmed  for more than 48h and is  being cancelled. If you
did want it executed but were unable to send the confirmation in time, just
re-issue the command to get a new  confirmation code. The one you were sent
before can no longer be used.
