        well, if we can get Dimitri to be the victim, I would enjoy 
    nothing more than exercising some well honed skills of cynicism,
    sarcasm, and the classic art of insult on *his* chosen subject(s).

        take no prisoners!

        the fact English may not be his native language (the Russians
    require fluency in American English to matriculate past age 14) 
    --I have no conscience, in other words,...

        of course, that assumes you will tolerate a roast where the
    stated goal is his resignation from the list; maybe we can send him
    off to Perry who apparently has become too personally disgruntled to
    stay with us.  ??--after all, code is on coderpunks.

        several literate assaults managed to clear Dr. Fred from the 
    list.  Dimitri just does not know when to quit.

            ...attila out!
