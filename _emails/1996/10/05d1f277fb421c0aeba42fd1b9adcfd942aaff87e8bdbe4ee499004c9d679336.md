Oh my, you mean diffferent sides of a controverial topic are saying
different things? What's a po reporter to do?

Translation: I'm a lazy journalist who considers any controversy that
requires more than just asking the two sides about it as too complicated to
understand, and my editor wants me to dumb everything down anyway.

I guess it is hard to turn a large number of mathematical, technical, legal
and philosophical issues into no more than 3-syllable words, 15 word
sentences, 5 line paragraphs filling 1 column of a magazine. 

Maybe this reporter should have viewed the article on lattice crypto in The
Economist a couple of months back It's not impossible to explain the basic
issues at stake if you are willing to do some research and not insult the
intelligence of your audience. 

Of course, Time would be unlikely to print such an article that precludes
the semi-literate from understanding it. Besides which, I'm sure that there
is something *important* happening to Brad Pitt or Julia Roberts that needs
to be covered first.
