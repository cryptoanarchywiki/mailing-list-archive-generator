Well, if it were up to me, I'd "unsubcribe" you all right, but it's not.  I don't think 
you realize who you're dealing with. I've crossed the wrong people now and then, posting 
messages I shouldn't have, and I've been lucky so far.  If I were in your position, I'd 
get some advice from one of those guru-types who know their way around these places.
