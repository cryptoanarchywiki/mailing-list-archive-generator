Well if you are running OS/2 you might want to check out:

http://www.carbonbased.com.au/csinfo.htm

They have an ISF (installable file system) that supports DES & 3DES in ECB & CBC
modes.

I personally haven't check this product out but bookmarked the page as it is the
first crypto IFS I have found.
