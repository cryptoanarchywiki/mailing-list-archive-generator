For those of you not in PacBell territory, PacBell really misunderstood
the Internet access market when they set their current rates.
ISDN costs $X/month (about 2-3 x POTS) plus (daytime) per-minute charges
of 4 cents, (nighttime 7pm-7am) free.  (This probably requires that
your ISP have Centrex access in your local calling area.)
What they didn't realize was that computer people think 
"It's free at night" means "It's free at night", so they dial up and stay on.
(Many of us non-ISDN users do the same with POTS, of course.)

ISDN call setup times are fast enough that it's possible to
do IP support that tears down calls after X seconds of non-use
and sets them up again when there's traffic, which is practical
since you don't have 30 seconds of modem retraining time per setup.
If PacBell's really bugged enough about usage patterns, they could
go write a good Winsock package to support it themselves
and give it away free to ISDN customers....

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
  and the politicians had to count them all.
