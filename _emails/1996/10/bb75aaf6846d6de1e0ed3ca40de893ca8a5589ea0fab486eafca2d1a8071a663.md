I *loved* this from the Washington Post reporter who showed that he is a
little light on his understanding of the First Amendment too.

"As it has been interpreted by the courts for years, the
 First Amendment doesn't protect lies, and it doesn't
 protect obscenity, and it doesn't prohibit government from
 regulating what's known as 'commercial speech.'"

It does protect most lies.  It does protect some obscenity.  It does
protect quite a lot of commercial speech.
