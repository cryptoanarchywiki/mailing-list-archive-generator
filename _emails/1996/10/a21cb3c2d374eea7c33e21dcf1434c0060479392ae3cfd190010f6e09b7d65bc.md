yes ... the more one looks at the "random sequence" question, the more
questions that arise!  Again, referring to Knuth ... anything that takes
as many pages in one of his books as "Definition of Random Sequence" does
is certainly nontrivial.

A "gap" in my current inquiry is the number of bit positions between occurrances
of a specific bit-pattern.  My current investigation uses same-bit repetitions (00, 11),
but of course that generalizes to any specific n-bit pattern (e.g. we should get
the same results **in a perfect random sequence** if we count gaps between the
pattern "11" or the pattern "01".

I'm going to have to chew on this .... but thanks for the Poisson hint.  Actually,
it looks like some graphs I've generated just might have some similarity to Poisson
distribution!!!  Bears more thought.

I certainly appreciate your time in replying in such depth.  It'll take a few days to
digest.

Thanks again,
Regards
