After establishing your offshore banking account you can move moderate
amounts of money there from the U.S. by using private money order or
travellers checks.  Most money transmitters and banks won't ask for ID or
that you fill out the payorpayee in the process.  If you live in a large
city there should be enough outlest to enable you to transport
$10,000s/month without seeing the same merchant twice in same month.  It'll
just look like you don't have a checking account and are paying you're
monthly bills.

The advantage of these instruments, of course, is that they are relatvely
safe from loss.

As was pointed out earlier on the list, you can use FedEx to send int'l
parcels w/o providing identification.
