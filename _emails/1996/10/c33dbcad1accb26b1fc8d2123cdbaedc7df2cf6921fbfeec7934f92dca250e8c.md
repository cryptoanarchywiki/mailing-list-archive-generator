I notice two conference announcements this morning, both focussed on the
Internet as a _threat_. While the conference organizers no doubt don't mean
to play into the hands of the Administration's self-serving scaremongering
about the Four Horsemen, it _is_ interesting that the focus of more and
more attention is on threats to the Internet. (And a possible subtext of
threats _by_ the Internet.)

Here are the two announcements:

I assume the Rutgers conference is more about the threats _to_ the
Internet, and that the "Assessing the Internet Threat" is more about the
Four Horsemen, pedophiles, decency, V-Chips, key escrow, export
restrictions, import bans, zero tolerance for crypto abusers, and all that
Big Brother stuff.

If my theory is right, that the Internet is increasingly being portrayed
(by some journalists, by many politicians, and by conferences) as a scary
place that needs to be regulated and policed, expect our various friends
and families to ask us about the "dangers" of the Net.

Creating a sense of fear is always the first step.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
