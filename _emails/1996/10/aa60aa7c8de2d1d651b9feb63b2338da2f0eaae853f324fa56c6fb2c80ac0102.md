How'd that old line go about cooking implements and carbon deposits?  

As has often been enumerated on the list:
	If someone wishes to say something - anything - to a group of like-minded
people, that is his choice.  If they choose not to listen, that is their
choice.   If declan chooses not to forward mail to a list he moderates, it's
his choice.  He doesn't force anyone to read that list.  He certainly doesn't
force them to avoid any other lists. If they don't like his list or disagree
with his views they can show their disapproval by going elsewhere (seealso:
Free Market)


Consider your argument in a different light:  Do you complain that Rush
Limbaugh never lets the head of N.O.W. or Bill Clinton do a show?
