I thought we had a 5th amendment.  Isn't turning over your key that may (or
may not) expose encriminating evidence an extension of self-encrimination?
Haven't there been dozens of famous witnesses (Patty Hurst, Oliver North,
etc) that "take the 5th" dozens of times on the stand.  Why couldn't I
"take the 5th" when asked for my encryption keys?  When asked for your key,
can't you say: "I'm sorry your honor, but I respectfully refuse to answer
that question on the grounds that it may incriminate me.".

Any legal-eagles out there?
