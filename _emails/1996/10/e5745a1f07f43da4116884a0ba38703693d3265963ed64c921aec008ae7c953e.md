They could, however, take random checks which could also be
performed off-line (after the connection was established or even already finished again). Remember we called it fraud-*detecting* not fraud-*preventing*.
BTW, some people on the cypherpunks list seem to think that you can't fraude with a *voluntary* system. However, that is possible: when you do not comply with the *agreed* rules of conduct then the phrase "fraude" is appropriate. The same holds, for instance, when you make copies of microsoft word and resell them. Then you don't comply to the rules that you voluntarily agreed to when buying it...

I agree, that is inevitable.

Can you imagine what would happen if governments would (help to) set up a system that has no safeguards at all, i.e.  that could give criminals all the anonimity and confidentiality they need? Governments can't probably prevent criminals and the like to use encryption to stay out of sight of law enforcement agencies, but they should not facilitate them either. In the next few years all kinds of "standard" commerical software will come on the market with all kinds of standard security in it. I don't want criminals to be happy with Custom of The Shelf products for security, let them work for their security.

We have set up the TRPs in such a flexible way that anybody could find one he can trust, one might even set up his own TRP. Also in the paper we describe how two or more TRPs could be used. Maybe some countries don't want TRP at all. The bottom line is that law-abiding citizens always have to give up some of their freedom to stop criminals (that is why you have to have registration plates on your car, a lock on your car, bicycle, house etc.). That is a fact of life; one I hate. So the point is: where is the middle of giving up freedom and stopping criminals? Well, I think that our concept gives a flexible way of implementing any national middle.. I agree with some of the poster to cypherpunks that governments involves the general public too less in the determination of this middle (some posters said it more strongly). Cryptopolicy is not a binary discussion; although some posters on this list seem to think so.

You are absolutely right. However, as said above if governments (help to) set up a security system then they should at least attempt to make criminal abuse difficult. The lock on my bicycle is not really 100% either (as I found out quite to often); if I'd no lock at all I would have a lot more problems. Also, I am *not* for a mandatory system.


Best regards, Eric
