A hearing is scheduled in federal district court in San Jose for 10/30 at
10:00 AM on _Schlafly v. Public Key Partners_ and _RSA Datasec v. Cylink_.
The hearing is on defendant Cylink's motion(s) for summary judgment
regarding the validity of the Diffie-Hellman and Hellman-Merkle patents. 

The district court is located at 280 S. First in San Jose. Judge Williams
is in Courtroom 4 on the 5th floor. There are 12 matters scheduled at 10:00
AM so it's unlikely that this matter will be heard at exactly 10:00. (It's
listed as fifth in the court calendar in The Register and the Daily
Journal, but I've got no clue about their algorithm for calling cases.) I
don't know if it will be interesting or boring. The fewer metal things you
bring the faster you can get through the metal detectors.
