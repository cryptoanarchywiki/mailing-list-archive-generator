Unless the "YES" was in private email to Sandy, he lies (again)
about ever having given any form of a straight answer.

Sandy, I am not even sure that this is such a good idea...
rewarding the annoying with a free, wintertime trip to CA
with free lodging seems to be a way of encouraging more of
the annoying... The last thing we need. Respected c-punks
are dropping like flies as it is. Perhaps you'll prove me
wrong and shut him up, if he proves me wrong by attending,
that is.
