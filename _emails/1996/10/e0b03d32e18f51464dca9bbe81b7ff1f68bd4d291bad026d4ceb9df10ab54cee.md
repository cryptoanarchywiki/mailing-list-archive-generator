Given that keys = data, this just transfers the problem from one set of
data to another set of data. (Wanna bet a lot of ISPs would keep backups of
the disk with the keys on it?)

Granted, there's a compression factor, but the basic issue is not changed.
If the ISP is trusted to not make backups of user files, and overwrites the
disk, this is about as good as the vendor encrypting the files and then
agreeing to "lose" the key.

(Though let's hope he neither loses it, nor "looses" it (the common
misspelling), by throwing it in his Dumpster trashcan, a la the infamous
Mykotronx "losing" (and hence "loosing") of Clipper secrets.)
