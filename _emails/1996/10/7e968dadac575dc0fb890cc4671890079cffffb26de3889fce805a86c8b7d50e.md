I just wanted to weigh in on a couple of points that have
been raised with respect to the SPA lawsuit against C2Net:

1) I don't think this is some sort of evil plot by SPA members
   because we hadn't joined or because we're competing with
   some of their members. A lot of their members compete with
   other members and non-members and nothing like this has 
   happened before. It's pretty clear that they were oblivous to a 
   great many things, including the fact that we're primarily
   a software company these days.

2) As obnoxious as the lawsuit is, we don't miss the humor in
   the fact that we've been grumbling (on-line and off) about 
   folks who pirate Stronghold (our commercial, secure version
   of the Apache web server). We really were looking into 
   joining the SPA, to see if it would do us any good in dealing 
   with this problem.

3) If you run across any mention of this lawsuit in the media,
   either on-line or in print, it would be great if you could
   forward it to me at cman@c2.net, or fax it to me at:
   510 986 8777. I want to be tracking the press coverage
   very closely, and our clipping services takes about 5-10
   days to read and process clippings for us.

Thanks for your help,

Douglas Barnes
