So, by virtue of declaring "this" area as a Drug Free zone, are they 
declaring other areas drug-unfree zones?  Does this legitimize the use of 
drugs in other zones? (could be an interesting flow of logic, only it's 
doubtfult it would hold "But yer honor, there was no sticker saying it 
was a drug free zone, so that means it's okay to do drugz" :)

So what happens if you're just hanging out and aren't doing drugs, say 
two guys wait for their friend or something, and have no drugs on them 
but don't disperse?

Can there a lawsuit be there against the officers who would arrest them 
for wrongful arrest?  (probably not)

This is of course vewy vewy silly.
