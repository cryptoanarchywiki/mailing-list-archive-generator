Just got off the phone with the NSA.

"There are so many places in the NSA that deal with cryptology
we haven't been able to find the document yet. We'll call you
back once we locate it and let you know if it can be released
or not. We've been getting phone calls about the document. Did
you read about it on the Internet?"
