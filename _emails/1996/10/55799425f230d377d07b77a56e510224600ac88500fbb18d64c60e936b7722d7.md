Emotionally:  no
Biologically: maybe  (There is that unexplained trip to Sweden.)

I think that he should look into Trepanning, Phrenology, or both opon his
trip to the Bay area.  (When and if he ever goes...)

Actually Vulis has proved his colors over and over opon the net.  That is
why he gets so little respect here and elsewhere.

Maybe he thinks that you are all planning some sort of welcome out of
"Deliverance" or something...  ("We're gonna make you squeal like a modem,
boy!")  Explains the request for banjo players on some of the other lists,
however...
