This is a very dangerous statement to make.  IBM is nowhere near as powerful
as they were, but they're still very solidly entrenched in the business
world*.   Money is what will ultimately decide this issue - if  Bill
Clinton's VISA was abused after a hacker sniffed a network transaction ITAR
would be dead within seconds!


* - people have said that OS/2 is dead.  Well it turns out that IBM is making
several *BILLION* in sales every year on it from their business deals. 
According to figures I've seen, they have a high percentage of the F500
market.
