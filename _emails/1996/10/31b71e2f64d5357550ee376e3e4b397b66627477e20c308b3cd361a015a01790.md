I think the biggest problem with allowing "anyone" to check the correctness 
of a key is that what is a technical possibility today, will become a 
legally-mandated requirement tomorrow.  What if Internet backbone companies 
and/or ISP's were told that they had to implement software check these keys, 
and if they discovered an "incorrect" escrowed key, they were legally 
obligated to either refuse to forward that message, and/or forward a copy of 
that message to someone like Spooks@NSA.gov or Thugs@DOJ.gov.    

Even worse, if this checking process revealed the sender, or at least a 
coded identity unique to the sender, the government could issue "digital 
APB's" where it would insist on being sent copies of all messages with a 
given ID number.  Suddenly, the Internet might go from being hard to tap, to 
being practically automatically tapped.
