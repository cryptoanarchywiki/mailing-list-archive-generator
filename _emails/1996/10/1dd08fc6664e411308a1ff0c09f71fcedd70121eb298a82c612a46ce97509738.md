Well, sad to say, a lot of Navajos are being used as intermediaries for 
"black-ops" projects.  It's the sovereignty scam (used when it's useful 
to them), like British subjects intercepting U.S. phone calls, etc.

You're getting close to something.  There's going to have to be a 
definition of intent for international (and eventually domestic) audio 
communications, to establish the originator's intent, even ignoring 
stego issues.

If they're not careful, they could open up a juicy can of worms.  For 
example, when the L.A. Times ran a recent headline to the effect that 
areas around China were becoming a hotbed of weapons dealing and so on, 
you could interpret that (if you're paying attention) as an invitation 
to weapons dealers and buyers to "come and get it while it's hot".

Look at the time lines for getting secure crypto into the hands of the 
more-or-less average person, then imagine a much shorter time line for 
the spinoff programs that do these specialized tasks. Short time lines 
don't give bureaucrats much time to work with, so if such programs get 
into wide use, the govt. will have to generalize the prohibitions more 
than they've announced so far.
