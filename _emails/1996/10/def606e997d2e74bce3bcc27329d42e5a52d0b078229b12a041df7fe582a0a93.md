I still maintain (and I'm working on some proposals --- 
it just takes more time than I have to form them well) that there
are strategies for partitioning the keyspace that are likely to be 
more efficient, given how likely it is that the key is 
constructed/derived/etc., using certain common techniques.

Now, if there is **NO** information as to how the key is constructed/derived, then
all the assumptions about a perfectly distributed keyspace result in the
conclusions we are all familiar with.  But you know the adage --- smarter, not
harder, and all that.  There WILL (almost always) be knowledge of the key 
generation techniques.  It is unlikely that geiger counters are in use by the
banks.  **IFF** there is a-priori knowledge of the key gen techniques, then 
it should be used if possible.

Now, I happen to be working on ONE SPECIFIC and common generation technique,
and there is some reason to believe that when it is used there is a more
efficient approach to partitioning.

There are a lot of caveats here ... and don't overgeneralize what I'm after -
I'm only espousing these ideas to stimulate other thought along the same
line.

Regardez.
