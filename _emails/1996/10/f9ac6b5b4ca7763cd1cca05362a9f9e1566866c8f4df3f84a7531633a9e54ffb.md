At the Bernstein case oral arguments last September, I distinctly
remember the government lawyer stating that the United States does
not restrict "financial cryptography." Perhaps he should have
qualified his argument somewhat.

This statement bothered me, as I cannot understand how an encryption
algorithm can "know" that it is encrypting a financial transaction,
rather than some non-financial document that would be export-restricted.
