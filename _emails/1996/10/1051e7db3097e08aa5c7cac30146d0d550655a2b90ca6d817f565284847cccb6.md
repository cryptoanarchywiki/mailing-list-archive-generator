The point is, the govt. already has the info, much as if you had a bunch 
of computers and digiboards or whatever monitoring all your neighbors' 
phone calls.  It's whether they can legally present the info in court to 
put you away or not that matters.  The law tends to move in the 
direction of recent decisions, particularly in saying that the police 
"acted in good faith" in collecting the info, and that they "didn't 
conspire to collect the info deliberately knowing it wasn't legal", etc.

Problem is, the govt. will continue to ease the restrictions on the 
latter argument, since in the former, they *always* act in "good faith".
