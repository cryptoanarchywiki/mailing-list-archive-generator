Show me the scientific proof that a monkey cannot write a bestselling
novel in 100 minutes.  Of course you can't.  This is called "proving a
negative."

The fact that this little nuance has escaped you does not bode well for
your software generated OTP scheme or, indeed, your general intelligence.

Ok, what scientific proof exists that a truely random number generator can
be software based?  There is not one scintilla of sustainable evidence to
support this concept either.

Ok, here comes the part where you tell us that you are the Einstein of
cryptography and will prove all the experts wrong?  "They laughed at me at
the institute, but I will show them!"  (In this case they laughed at you
because you are an idiot, not because they were shallow minded.

Yadda, yadda, yadda.  Does your software not use arithmetic?

All of the above is substanceless hype.  Why, exactly, are you telling us?
Clearly none of us are going to buy your product.  I suggest trying to get
the FTC procurments section to purchase EUREKA in bulk for their own use.

"Captain, the phase dampener has overrided the antimatter flux capicator.
I think I can pin it down with a phased neutreno pulse if I isolate the
presence of diocrastic radiation."
