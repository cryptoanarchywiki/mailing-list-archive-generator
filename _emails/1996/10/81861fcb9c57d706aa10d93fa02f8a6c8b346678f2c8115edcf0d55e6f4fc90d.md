You can start with http://www.c2.org/nofv/


Basically, if you can get access to someone's email, then you can
defraud the system.  FV protects themselves by holding payments for
90 days before they pay the merchant.  It's an unsecure system, with
no encryption.  FV will accept no responsibility for this, and when
people cheat, the merchant gets screwed.
