I think the Wombat may have this one nailed.  I have made the
same mistake others on this list have made--I assumed some 
semblance of rationality, civility and knowledge of appropriate
social behavior in another.  Giving someone the benefit of a
doubt is not a bad thing, but to continue doing so indefinitely
is.  

I'll let my offer of airfare, lodging and transportation stand 
through the end of the month, then it will automatically be 
withdrawn and the pledge partners will be off the hook.  If
Dimitri wishes to address a future meeting of SF Bay area 
Cypherpunks at our expense, he must unequivocally commit to it
before midnight (California time) October 31.  After that, it 
will be up to him to pay his own way or to pass the plate on his
own.  (Personally, I'm convinced that he is far to big a coward
to ever come here, no matter what the inducement.)

Other than with regard to my offer, I am taking RW's pledge.
Shunning works for the Amish; I think it can work for us too.
