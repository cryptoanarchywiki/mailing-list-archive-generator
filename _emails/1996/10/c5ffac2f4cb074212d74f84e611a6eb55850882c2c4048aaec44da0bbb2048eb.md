This is exactly why the hell *we* shouldn't be in Bosnia.

Very simple explanation. You go to that much trouble (murder) when you *really* need to 
get some SOB or parasite off of your back.  I'm still not sure BTW how to relate to the 
betting pools, etc., as a (relatively) healthy market-driven instrument.

If you're talking about the "new" KKK (a la David Duke), forget it.  Duke was and is a 
CIA agent, from his missions in SE Asia for his father circa late 1960's. It's amazing 
how much of this media hooey sticks in people's brains.  Did you know that the largest 
contingents of KKK members of all time, by far (50,000 per city), were in Akron and 
Columbus, Ohio?  And where the KKK originated, in SE Tennessee (about a mile from where 
I worked for four years), is also where one of the greatest events for freedom ever took 
place - an armed uprising of the citizenry with its sole purpose to get an honest vote 
count for local sheriff, which they did. It'd be nice to get a public vote count today.

As far as contract killers with an agenda of their own, Joey the Hit Man (a real person, 
and very scary) says that professional killers very rarely kill for personal reasons 
outside of getting paid.  Just don't do something stupid like John Gotti's next-door 
neighbor did, and backing out of your driveway, accidentally back over Gotti's daughter 
and kill her.

This in some ways is the most crucial question in these rants.  Are you saying that 
society can really reject digital cash?  That it will go away completely when this 
society says it should?  I guess I'm to assume here that the "secret" agencies will 
maintain use of such cash for their purposes, while *preventing* the rest of us from 
using it somehow.

Can I assume that since the Internet is global, that e-cash will be too?

A lot of people make disparaging remarks about "third world" countries, where you have 
to bribe everyone to get anywhere. But can these ranters really claim that the U.S. is 
any different when it comes down to serious issues?  Try attending some city council 
meetings, with the intention to "make a difference", and you'll see what I mean.
