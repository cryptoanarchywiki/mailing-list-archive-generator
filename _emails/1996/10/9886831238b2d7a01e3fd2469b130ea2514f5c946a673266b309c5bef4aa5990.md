Cryptography is, basically, the area of hidden meanings.  In a sense, a 
voice-stress analyzer is intended to seek out hidden meanings in a person's 
statements.  So I'd say it's as on-topic as most of the stuff 'round here.

One thing I wonder is this:  Can the stress indications be removed from a 
voice-containing signal by some sophisticated DSP processing?  Just look for 
whatever effect that indicates stress, add it in equal and negative amounts 
to eliminate the apparent stress, etc.    It might not make sense for 
anything less "critical" than debates, but if the control of the debates is 
as monopolized as we think it is, it is reasonable to think that debate 
participants would insist on a certain level of control over the audio signal.

Well, I sorta assumed this.  But I would still be interested to get some 
kind of quantitative feedback on the debates.  If anything, the ABSENSE of 
the news media's attempting to use voice-stress analysis is telling.
