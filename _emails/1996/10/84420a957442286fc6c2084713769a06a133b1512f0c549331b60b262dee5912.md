This is certainly the case with 99% of the computer industry press!

I certainly have no problem believing that a group of well-supplied
professionals could, with enough time and [political] support, take down a
single target.   For instance, if the CIA,FBI and NSA wanted to hose the 1st
Bank of China, I have a feeling that they would - eventually.   I have strong
doubts that someone would come up with a non-nuke that could destroy stuff
indiscriminately within a useably large area.
