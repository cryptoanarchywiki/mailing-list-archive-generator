Sounds to me like there's a need for a program that can produce secure 
encryption, yet the output looks like "real junk", i.e., not anything 
like what one of the *better* programs would produce.  Then you can 
claim (with testimony of experts if necessary) that "I didn't encrypt 
it, must be just garbage".  And even if you got some bozo govt. person 
testifying against you, you shouldn't have much problem making them look 
stupid and vindictive in front of a jury.
