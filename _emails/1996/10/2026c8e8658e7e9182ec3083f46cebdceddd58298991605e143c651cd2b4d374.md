Apologies for repeats, & please repost where appropriate.

Well, now Ladbroke House is not even selling Clinton, and he has gone
up from 1:8 to 1:10 at William Hill, while Dole fell a bit more, and
just *look* at the William Hill Perot odds, doubling from last time!
Whee!

Wide disparity there, as Ladbroke's is still holding steady at 50:1 on
the little guy, now that they're offering him again. Still no odds yet
from Coral, and the nym's giving troubles, and still no offer -- or
official explanation for the lack of odds -- on Harry Browne. I suppose
folks can keep speculating, still seems like easy money for the house
to the oddsman.

Our roving reporter had the following to say:

   "Looks like you're getting trouser-brain back !      :-)"

I suppose so, we get the government we deserve. The oddsman wishes to
thank all involved, and he is still looking for a Moscow correspondent
for possible UK arbitrage opportunities. :> Thanks also to all who are
"in the know" for not revealing my identity. 'Till next time.
