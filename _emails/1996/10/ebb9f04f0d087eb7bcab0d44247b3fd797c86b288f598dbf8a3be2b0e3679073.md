  The truly frightening thing here is that Bill gates has come out more
often on the strong crypto side than Netscape, Apple, IBM and just about
everyone else.  Why is this?  Has Justice crapped on him once too often,
and now he's looking for payback?
  At first I thought that it may be that Microsoft has big financial
transaction plans.  If this were true, they would probably get the leniency
that banks and others get for crypto. 
  So what is it? Here is my theory, if you will indulge me for a minute; It
was a dark and stormy...uh middle of the afternoon in Redmond.  Bill is at
his desk reading the latest sales figures for Windows and Office 95.  "600
million, hot shit! But I grow bored with commonplace software, I need new
money schem..uh challenges".  Somehow Bill finds his way into Building 666
on the Microsoft campus.  The building is home to Microsoft's Security and
Crypto division.  He hails a young minion. "Here my son, what have you done
for me today?" The young man gulps, "Uh well let me see Mr Gates...".
Suddenly Bill notices the boy's shirt. It is black, on the front are
printed the words; "This T-Shirt is a Munition".  Under the words are a few
lines of code.  Because they are not Basic, Bill is confused. He blurts
out,"Say that isn't Java is it!". "No Mr. Gates, it's Perl. This is the RSA
code implemented in it." Bill says,"I see, carry on my boy". The young man
scurries back to his office.
  Suddenly it strikes Gates like the first time he envisioned the DOS
liscening scheme. "Munitions! Hot shit, weapons on a floppy I could make
billions! I could arm the whole world with Microsoft weapons of software
and dominate any governments who got in my way! Then I could have Larry
Ellison and Marc Andressen and any other punks who made fun of me locked
away".  
  I'm sure it didn't happen just this way.  It's quite possible that Bill
gates never says "hot shit".
