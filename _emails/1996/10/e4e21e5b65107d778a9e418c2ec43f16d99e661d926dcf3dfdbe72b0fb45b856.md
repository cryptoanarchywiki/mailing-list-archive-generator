Excuse me for saying this, but the above simplistic statement is no more 
valid than saying "...but I only drove the car, I didn't shoot the bank 
teller...", or, "...I only built the plant that made the V2 rockets, I 
didn't fire any...", or, "I support my local police (who shoot people 
sometimes), but I don't believe in killing.", and so on.
