Phone numbers in the US look like CountryCode-NPA-NXX-XXXX, where
CountryCode=1, NPA is the Numbering Plan Area, N is 2..9, and X is 0..9.
NPAs used to look like N0X or N1X, and exchange codes used to look like
NNX, and the not-very-powerful computers in old telephone switches
could tell a long-distance call from a local call by translating on the
first three digits.  Switches are smarter now, and the number space
is filling up, so exchange codes and NPA both look like NXX.

Memorizing Stuff still leaves you a Clueless Newbie.  Learn Stuff.
Understand Stuff.  Do New Stuff.  (Not that memorizing hurts, of course...)

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
  and the politicians had to count them all.
