I'm rather sorry too.  I found the information at http://www.c2.org/nofv 
to be of interest and would have liked an answer to the privacy issue 
specifically and the other issues brought up by that document.

Unfortunately I had a work-related problem that kept me from 
leaving Monroe in time to make the trip up to East Lansing.

If you would answer that point on privacy, that was to be the main 
interest I had in attending the meeting.  Having read through the 
material offered at http://www.fv.com, I still feel the privacy issue and 
the ability to intercept email confirmations still haven't been 
addressed.  You discuss email interception in 
http://www.fv.com/pubdocs/FAQ-security.txt, but that document is from 
Nov, 1995 and doesn't address the concern adequately in my opinion.
