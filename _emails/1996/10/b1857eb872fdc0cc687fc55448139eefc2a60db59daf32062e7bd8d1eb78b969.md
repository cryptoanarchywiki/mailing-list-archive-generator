Sorry, but you asked.  Brown's plane was deliberately guided into a 
mountain by a different tower signal than was guiding it in mid-flight.
Someone had the real tower kill or redirect their signal so the second 
tower or whatever could switch in.

I thought everyone knew that.

Bear in mind, when you first go to work for a U.S. intel agency, the 
first thing they teach you is "there are no coincidences" (of any real 
significance).  And how fortunate for Mr. Eisner and his hundreds of 
millions in personal income per year that Frank Wells (Mr. Disney's 
protege) expired in that helicopter(?) crash a couple years ago.
