Automobiles, computers, chips, steel, tobacco, televisions....

All have had, or still have, various "import restrictions." Sometimes
quotas, sometimes heavy duties, sometimes complete bans. Sometimes the
rationale was that foreign nations were "dumping," but often the real
rationale was protectionism.

(This may not have been the type of example the questioner was asking
about, but it fits the definition of "import restrictions." In fact, the
whole raison d'etre of "U.S. Customs" is to control imports as well as
exports, and certainly not just "illegal imports.")

There are also various animals which may not be imported, various
agricultural products which may not, etc., even if the animals and
agricultural products may be found in the U.S. (Examples: various reptiles,
tropical birds, endangered species, etc.)
