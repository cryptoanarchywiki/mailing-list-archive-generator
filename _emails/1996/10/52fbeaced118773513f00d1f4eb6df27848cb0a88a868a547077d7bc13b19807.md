Congress doesn't need to explicitly approve the use of new investigatory
tools or techniques. Do you think that cops needed special legislation
before they could use cars, or telephones, or helicopters, or cameras, or
fancier guns, or ..? 

Also, Congress is not the only legislature to think about - the individual
states can (and have) developed their own statutes relating to wiretaps,
law enforcement use of wiretaps, and so forth. (See, e.g. Cal. Penal Code
s. 630 et seq, Oregon Revised Stats. s. 165.540 et seq) 

Also, Congress' intent when it passed Title III in 1968 was not to
"legalize" wiretapping but to standardize it. I quote from Pub.L. 90-351
(1968):

    "On the basis of its own investigations and of published studies,
	the Congress makes the following findings:

	(a) Wire communications are normally conducted through the use of 
	facilities which form part of an interstate network. The same
	facilities are used for interstate and intrastate communications.
	There has been extensive wiretapping carried on without legal 
	sanctions, and without the consent of any of the parties to the
	conversation . . . The contents of these communications and
	evidence derived therefrom are being used by public and private
	parties as evidence in court . . .

	(b) In order to protect effectively the privacy of wire and oral
	communications, to protect the integrity of court and administrative
	proceedings, and to prevent the obstruction of interstate commerce,
	it is necessary for Congress to define on a uniform basis the
	circumstances and conditions under which the interception of wire
	and oral communications may be authorized . . ."

It took me less than ten minutes to find that. You could have taken that
ten minutes instead. It's abundantly clear that you don't give a shit about
the accuracy of what you write. If you're making things up or speculating,
you could at least say something like "I think Congress was probably acting
to legalize previously illegal wiretaps in 1968", so that it's clear that
you're writing on the basis of speculation, not research. It'd also be nice
if you'd add some sort of indication that you're posting about your own
secret version of the law instead of the one that's used in courtrooms, but
I'm going to go ahead and assume that the former is what you mean in the
future.

As a matter of Constitutional interpretation, the Supreme Court cannot be
"wrong". You and I can disagree with them, but their interpretation is the
magic one that trumps ours in court. If we're going to try to organize our
lives around a body of writings (e.g., laws) it's not useful for everyone
to make up their own meanings for the laws because if we're all following
different laws, that's more or less the same as having no law at all.
Somebody's interpretation has to be the "right" one; and the United States
is organized and has evolved such that the Supreme Court's is the right one. 
I think it's reasonable for you to say that you don't want to play that
game, but I don't see why you need to pretend that your failure to play the
game has anything to do with law or legal reasoning. 

If what you want is anarchy (and as I understand things, you're arguing
that people should live by their own interpretation of what's right and
wrong, and should kill people who disagree with them, which seems like a
fair although unnecessarily dismal view of anarchy), there's no point in
arguing about the Constitution.

It's not inadvertent - I meant what I said. The Constitution is a document
for organizing a government. If you're going to interpret it into such a
pretzel-like format that it no longer describes a functional government,
it's much more sensible to just say "I don't want to have a government". If
you do want to have a government, interpretations which prevent it aren't
useful. 

Your hypothetical "conflict of interest" problem seems beside the point; I
don't see how the "can government ever be legitimate?" or "can the
government exist?" or "can the government act to enforce the laws?" sort of
questions which would create a conflict would ever really be up for debate.
There's simply no meaningful argument that the Constitution was intended to
do anything but create a government; and it envisions that the executive
branch will enforce laws that the legislature chooses to enact.

Again, there are certainly other ways to organize human behavior and human
societies. But they don't need to have anything to do with the Constitution. 
In particular, I don't see any reason to try to make anarchy and the
Constitution compatible in some perverted logical universe.

Sorry. I skipped a step. I see no meaningful distinction between wiretaps
and other searches & seizures. The rule you want to apply to wiretaps
should, if it's a good rule, be applied to all searches & seizures. There's
nothing special about phone calls.

If we're going to give people notice & an opportunity to be heard before
even preliminary steps are taken in a criminal proceeding, very few
prosecutions will get off the ground. (We can either leave people free
pending decisions about searches & arrests, in which case they've got
reason & an opportunity to make themselves scarce or destroy evidence; or
we can lock them up and seize their houses while arguing about
search/arrest warrants, which is also a problem because most of the
evidence about guilt or innocence isn't available yet .. so you're holding
people & property with very little evidence of wrongdoing. And that's not
constitutional or good.)

Also, the premises of your argument were known at the time the Fourth
Amendment was written & adopted. I think that if the writers & adopters had
meant for there to be a pre-search hearing for the target of the search,
they'd have said so.

You and Detweiler seem to be missing the distinction between what's
constitutional and what's useful or possible. I believe that wiretaps are
constitutional (assuming the cops jump through all the right hoops). I
believe that laws which force me to use wiretappable phones in my home or
business are unconstitutional. If many people use unwiretappable phones
then wiretaps will become obsolete. But they will still be constitutional
in their obsolescence. These two approaches "wiretaps are not allowed" and
"wiretaps are allowed but citizens are able to make them ineffective" do
reach a similar result (very few or no wiretaps) but the approach used to
reach the result is meaningfully different. In particular, the second
approach doesn't require a reorganization of search & seizure law. Such a
reorganization is unlikely to occur.

Your arguments are only "highly embarrassing" to someone who identifies
with the legal system only in that they have enough buzzwords and are
internally consistent (even if based upon fantasy) enough that people with
no meaningful contact with the legal system might mistake you for someone
familiar with it.

Depends on your perspective.

As this is really no longer even tangentially related to technology or
privacy, I won't post further about it (absent a renewed connection to
technology or privacy, which I don't anticipate). Jim, you and anyone else
who wants it are welcome to the "last word". Please don't interpret my
failure to respond as agreement or endorsement of anything beyond an
attempt to get the list back closer to being on-topic.
