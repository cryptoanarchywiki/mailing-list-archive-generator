(1) If I were faced with an opponent who had a crypto system I couldn't
break, I would attempt to make him think I could break it so he would stop
using it.  AKA FUD.

(2) If I could break his system, I would want him to continue using it.  I
would have to be very careful about how I used the material so he didn't
catch on to the break.  There are some wonderful examples of this logic in
"The Code Breakers".

(3) The devil is in the details.  I still am not convinced that MacPGP has
enough sources of entropy for its IDEA key generation.  (But I am not
convinced that it doesn't either.)  I put integrating Jon Callas's entropy
manager into MacPGP as a high priority.
