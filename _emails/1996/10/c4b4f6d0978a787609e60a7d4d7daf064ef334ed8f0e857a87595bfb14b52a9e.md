I suggest you take your beliefs to talk.origins.  I am sure that there are
a great number of people who will be willing to explain just *WHY*
creationism is no longer accepted as a rational belief.  

The current line of thought in evolutionary science is not just a whim or
"pissing in the wind", it is based on WHAT WORKS.  Creationists have spent
alot of time making claims as to why the earth was created by God, but none
of them has come up with the slightest shread of EVIDENCE as to it actually
being done that way.  What passes for "Creation Science" is alot of
nitpicking about evolutionary theory.  (As if somehow "disproving"
evolution will somehow "prove" creationism.)  Most of the so-called
"proofs" for Creationism are based on ignorance of what evolutionary theory
actually consists of.

I suggest that you actually read the talk.origins FAQs.  They might teach
you something about real science instead of that pretend science you have
been getting at church.

As for what this whole thread has to do with crypto, i have no idea...
