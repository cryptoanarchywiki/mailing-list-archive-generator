No, I doubt this is what folks are referring to when they talk about the
forthcoming "Second Edition."

I bought the 1982 hardback of Bamford, in 1982 (even before I really knew
crypto issues were of such interest to me...quite possibly reading Bamford
helped prepare me). A paperback edition came out a year or two later, with
some added material. But it was--so far as I know--still the First Edition.

The long-awaited Second Edition will be a major rewrite, as noted in the
various comments over the past couple of years.
