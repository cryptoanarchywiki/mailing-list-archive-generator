My comments here are not vitriolic, just factual. Clearly, while the
"guerilla" crypto meeting was happening, the higher-ups were selling out
their customers and going much further than they needed to in ensuring a
Big Brother State.

(BTW, in response to my "the surveillance system for the rest of us"
comment, Andrew Loewenstern sent me a note in which he contrasted Apple's
"1984" commercial with the current reality.)

This is the epitome of armchair psychoananalysis. How can you _possibly_
know what I thought about things? Jeez.

Who cares? Such comparisons are odious. I responded to Vinnie, not to the
"us" implied in "we asked," and the matter would've remained between Vinnie
and me had he not shared our e-mail with you and had you not then gone into
one of your  "free association" rants. Recall that even Vinnie was highly
critical of this performance.

Fuck off, to be blunt. You've got to learn to start making actual points,
and not trying to show your writing chops from the Hunter S. Thompson
Correspondence School of Creative Writing.

Fuck off. Back into my killfile you go.
