Graham, why would cypherpunks care about yet another net-scam?

Heh.  Ok, now I'm laughing-

someone with slightly less scruples than I, and a little more time, and
their own domain name & server, might consider writing a small
program to create a few thousand accounts.  Then sign them up with PINmail.
Every email address that's registered to PINmail gets you $5, right?



BTW, I think Graham's point is that they're probably neither really
secure nor really anonymous.  I don't know; I haven't checked them
out.  I do think it's interesting that they seem to think that there's
money to be made this way.  Even if their system is trivial to crack
they'll help make anonymity more noticeable to the general (net) public.
If they are easy to crack, some CP will do it and post the crack
with pointers to really secure anonymous services.
