  REM_ail

Now that Helsingius has shut down Penet, what's to stop him from simply 
LYING about the source of the messages in question, maybe claiming that they 
came from the output of a cypherpunks remailer and are thus permanently 
untraceable?

(one feature it might have been useful for him to have included in Penet is 
the ability of the user to re-address a return address, which would 
presumably erase the original address in the records.  Just sending email 
and some particular password would do it...)
