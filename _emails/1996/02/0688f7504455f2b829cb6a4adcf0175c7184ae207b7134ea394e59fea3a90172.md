        This fact seems to pique you, Duncan, as though it were somehow
unjust. If you feel so strongly, maybe you should get out and organize
those oceans of people who're waiting to think and vote just like you do.
Or is "organizing" too gauche for your finer sensibilities?
        I'm no fan of the man myself, but he _did_ win.
        Don't like it? Change it.
