   I hope that his code was not stolen, if it was actually stolen and then
released and we knew that for sure, then trade secret rights would probably
still apply. However the code was posted anonymously we do NOT know for
certain that it was MISAPPROPRIATED. As such it may have been reverse
engineered in manner that does not violate trade secrets and hence it can be
used. The burden is with RSA to prove that any one person KNEW it was
misappropriated. That is why we are seeing all these messages flying around
on the web, RSA attorneys are trying to shut the barn door after the horses
have left...

a rushed,

   Adam, Esq.
