      Congress has passed laws calling for sweeping censorship
      of computer networks, and the President is ready to

      the Communications Decency Act and Internet Censorship.

      ...And tell the Congress to repeal the CDA!!!!!!!!!

	Confirmed Speakers include:

	   o  Jonathan Wallace (A plaintiff in the ACLU court case
	        against the CDA, and Editor of The Ethical Spectacle)
	
	   o  Jonah Seiger (Policy Analyst, The Center for Democracy
	      	and Technology)

"With this act of Congress, the very same materials which are legally
available today in book stores and libraries would be illegal if posted on
World Wide Web sites or usenet newsgroups. If signed by President Clinton
as expected, this bill will transform the Internet overnight from the
freest communications medium to the most heavily regulated medium in the
United States." 

	- The Center for Democracy and Technology Policy Post 2:5.
