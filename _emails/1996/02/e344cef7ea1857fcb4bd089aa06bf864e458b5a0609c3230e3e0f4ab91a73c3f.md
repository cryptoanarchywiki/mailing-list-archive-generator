It appears to be legal, as MIT has done it. A written opinion has held
that other crypto sources can be taken out on paper, but no formal
opinion of the PGP sources in the MIT book has happened. It may only
be legal to take these sources out in the form of a published book,
however -- random printouts you do yourself may or may not be legal to
export since they don't qualify as "public domain" information.

In practice, of course, if you don't tell anyone and you arent someone
prominent you will never be caught no matter what you do.
