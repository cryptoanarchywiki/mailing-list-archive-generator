Uhhh- wait a second.  Anybody can always copy the file *and*
the signature to a new site without changing the
authentication.  And anybody can always copy the cleartext
and then sign it with a different key.  Right?  What are you
getting at?


Now what you can do is put the site's URL in the signed 
text, forcing the copier to change the URL and re-sign it
with his own key.  And you could time-stamp your document, 
proving that you had possession of it before the copier did.
But that's the extent of what you can do, AFAIK.

Yeah that was my idea.  A little "PGP signed" logo.  If the
user clicks on it it gives them the signature, and/or a href
to a PGP page.  (Probably one maintained by yours truly.)


> Yeah, I like the idea of a standardized logo. A lot.


I have a little logo which is (as I recall) 32x32 pixels
which is just "PGP" with a red check-mark superimposed.
I'll hack on this idea during what I jocularly refer to as
my spare time.
