interesting you should mention that. because of my interests
I've heard various legends that this list (long ago in a galaxy far away)
was sabotaged by piles of trash sent
through anonymous remailers, and the moderator quit instead of put
up with it (not provided the tools to keep out mail from unsubscribers). 
perhaps a little data point about forms of information
technology (and the absence of it) that *doesn't* necessarily lead 
to an improved form of human interaction. 

apparently there is some pretty harsh antagonism towards "electronic
democracy" among the people best suited to experiment with it, i.e.
the pioneers of cyberspace. but hell, alienation and nihilism is
so much more convenient and versatile than bubbly enthusiasm. 
it's a one-size-fits-all philosophy. "screw everyone!!!"  "it'll never
work!!!"  "government == tyranny!!"

something tells me that "electronic democracy" is going to survive
the death of an early mailing list dedicated to its discussion, however.

but thanks very much for the pointer,  Klaus! I'm always impressed with
the helpful spirit of everyone on this list.

(speaking of which I'd be interested in talking to anyone with spare 
resources to start mailing lists.)
