One point of stealth-pgp is to make an encrypted message you _can_
safely hide with stego.  Since the Bad Guys can take your stegofied picture,
destego it, and see the string ------ BEGIN PGP CONTRABAND DATA,
you can't get away with saying "no, that's just a picture of my cat,
blurred a bit because he was moving", which you can if you use a true
stealth version of PGP or other crypto program.

Another major point is to make PGP messages that you can post in public,
which the recipient can decode, but which _don't_ say
"From 007 To 86 and 99" in the headers.  That's easier, but still a bit of work.

You're down to key exchange; the big reason for public-key systems is to
avoid it.
