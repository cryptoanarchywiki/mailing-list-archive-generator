## Raw message

(aeb@cwi.nl is included, as he seems to be the last person to have
touched loop.c before it was put into the standard Linux kernel sources,
but I may be wrong.)

The file loop.c, included in recent Linux kernel sources, includes calls
to DES routines, such as:

#ifdef DES_AVAILABLE
static int transfer_des(struct loop_device *lo, int cmd, char *raw_buf,
                  char *loop_buf, int size)
{
<snip>
                        des_ecb_encrypt((des_cblock *) tmp,(des_cblock*)
                            loop_buf,lo->lo_des_key,DES_ENCRYPT);
<snip>
}
#endif

AFAIK, the presence of these hooks (even if surrounded by the ifdef's)
makes this file illegal to export from the United States.  Its presence
on ftp sites in the US could get someone in trouble.
