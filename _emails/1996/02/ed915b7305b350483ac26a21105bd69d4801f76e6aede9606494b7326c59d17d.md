How do I send Email through a cypherpunk remailer?

I know that I encrypt with PGP, but where should I write to who the email is
for???

I have list of remailers and I have their public keys, but it would be nice
if someone could add some remailers to my list!
Public keys to them aswell is appreciated!

There might be some FAQs about this, but never seen one.

 -- Please refer to where I can get the FAQ if there is one! --
