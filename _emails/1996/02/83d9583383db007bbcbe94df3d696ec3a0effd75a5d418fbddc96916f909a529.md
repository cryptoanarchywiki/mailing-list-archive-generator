I am just assuming that the Association (PCMCIA) has a way of distributing
specs, etc. I also assume they have a web page and all that, maybe 
even a citizen-unit subscribed to this mailing list who probably could
point us in the right direction.  I think PCMCIA cards offer a lot of
potential as wallets and general purpose privacy prophylaxis engines.
I don't know anything about the technology, but the device drivers, et al,
could be publicly reviewed and recompiled on trusted machines, presumably,
and the device itself could be tested (I assume) with a publicly 
available routine that once again one could install from source, etc. 

how much do the slots cost to add on to pc's that don't already have them?
Is there a parallel interface, for instance, that can plug into a 
printer port?
