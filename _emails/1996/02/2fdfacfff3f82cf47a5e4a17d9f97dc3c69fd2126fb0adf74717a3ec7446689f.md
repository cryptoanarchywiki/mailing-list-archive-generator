Democracy works because it recognizes the power of a majority.  If a
leader's policies are at odds with the will of the majority, sooner or later
they will rise up against him/her.  If you will allow me to throw a cliche
back at your "tyranny of the majority", how about "might makes right"?  Or
as Churchill said (more or less), "Democracy is the worst possible form of
government, except for all the others."

Notice that "might makes right" does not imply that any education is necessary.
