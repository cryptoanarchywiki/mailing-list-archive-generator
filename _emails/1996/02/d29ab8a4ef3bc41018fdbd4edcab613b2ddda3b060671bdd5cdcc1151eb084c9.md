I do not think that sound bites are the way to deal with these complex
issues. 
 
"Sound bites," (a.k.a. bumper stickers, advertising jingles, or more
accurately "magical thinking") contribute to the problem where
emotionally-charged issues are able to bypass the critical facilities. So
many of the attacks on crypto and the net are based exactly on sound bites
around the "Four Horsemen" coupled with magical incantations on simple ways
to defeat the problem. 
 
One does not fight magic with magic but with science; one does not fight
bad hysteria with good hysteria but with adult thinking.
