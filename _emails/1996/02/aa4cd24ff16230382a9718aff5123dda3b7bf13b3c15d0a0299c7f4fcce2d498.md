Those were the words beaming on the cover of this week's _Information
Week_. The totally worthless article on internet security contained
this little gem:

Federal Law enforcement agencies, alarmed by the growing threat of
Net-related security breaches and crimes, are stepping up their
investigations of online intrusions. "We're aware that this is a
serious problem for any industry using the Internet," says Jim
Freeman, special agent in charge of the FBI's San Francisco office.
"The ultimate solution will be through better technology such as
encryption, but we will investigate any crimes in which a computer is
used as an instrument of intrusion or fraud.


Complete with a picture of Freeman standing in front of an American
flag.
