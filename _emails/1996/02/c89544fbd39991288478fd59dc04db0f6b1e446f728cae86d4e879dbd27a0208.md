Rushdie is just low on your target list.  I agree that it's much harder
to protect 10,000 people (say the Iranians put out a contract on Baha'is
and other heretics, at $X/head...) but it's still abusable.  Maybe the
Anonymous Captains of Industry put out a contract on strike leaders.

>From a cypherpunks perspective, yes you could run an assassination lottery,
though it might be hard for the assassin to collect - how do you prove
that _you_ were the hit man, and not merely the nearest person to a phone
after it happened?  How do you prevent an anonymous escrow agency from refusing
to deliver the cash?  Some of the protocols may be difficult to work out.

An assassination-sponsoring society is _not_ a polite society.
