Frankly, Jim, the only reason I haven't torn apart all the utterly
ennervated simulacra of arguments you have posted to support your
"concepts" is that they are *all* off topic and I do not participated
in the discussion of off topic postings.

That does not, however, mean that I don't agree with the people who
think you are a loon, which is apparently a nearly universal
opinion.

Consider what I'm about to do kinder than using bets to encourage
someone to put a bullet in your brain, which is apparently your way of
solving all the world's problems.

PLONK.

Perry
