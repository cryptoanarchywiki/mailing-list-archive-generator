An article on the front page of WebWeek this week discusses digital
signatures and CAs.  The best point made was that a small company could
undercut (pricewise) the post office as a CA.  Overall it seemed a pretty
fair article.

It mentioned UC Berkeley researchers "spoofing" a Netscape server's
identity and sending false data to the client.  This was news to me, I am
curious as to how this was done.

The paper article also listed as a "resource on the net" the URL for Tim
May's cyphernomicon.

Here's the link.  Enjoy.
