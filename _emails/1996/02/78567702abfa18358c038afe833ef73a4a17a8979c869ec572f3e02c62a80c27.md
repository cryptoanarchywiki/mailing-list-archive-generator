You're right, I do remember reading about these somewhere... didn't
realize they were already in use.

Even so, I still don't think such a repeater would pass quantum-crypto
signals, excepting any photons that happened to just "leak" directly
through.  Your useful quantum state information resides in the
individual photons originally sent, and any even the optical repeaters
you describe achieve gain by by gating in *more* photons under the
incoming signal's control.  In so doing it will collapse the
wavefunctions of these incoming photons.

Not to say repeaters on the line aren't possible, but they'll have to
decode your data using a copy of the "secret" key, then re-encode for
transmission... so this will be a potential break-in point and need
good physical security.

You said power for the amps comes from a high-intensity,
shorter-wavelength beam... can this be superimposed on the original
signal at the point of origin, as with in-line coax-cable amplifiers?

Nice... :)
