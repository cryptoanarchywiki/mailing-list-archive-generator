Answer - No, there are other things involved, time to microseconds, as 
well as the actual algorithm, recipient - name and relative number, and 
an additional user OTP. Remember that every OTP is a true OTP, and a new 
one is used for each transmission. The information to recreate the 
starting OTP is transmitted but is encrypted with the real starting OTP set,
so it is not easy to figure out what the starting OTP is.

Isuspect the answer is "yes".  However if I

  I don't know the answer to this question.

It is definitely NO: You must have the the individual OTP to XOR out the 
message - It is the key to the encryption, and the obvious decryption.
The algorithm is impotent without the OTP.

 Assuming it is no, then I ask you: when can

 That is true, except you have a monstrous problem with key distribution 
 and the generation of the OTP keys. In effect, such a system would be 
 can OTP system, except it would not be as clean and as fast, and as 
 simplye as XORing the plain text with the OTP.

  I cannot argue with that characterization;however, I would point out 
  that a true One Time Pad must qualify as unpredictable, not 
  absolute random. We could generate indeterminate length OTPs but they 
  become unwieldy for huge files because the lengths must correspond - so 
  we have gone to the propogating method!

Yes, but it would be trival and not that big of a space problem to 
expand to a 10,000 bit key, or even a 20,000 bit key. We simply change a 
few parameters, in the C programs.

We will provide you with a free demonstration if you would like. We will 
also provide you with the methodology in written form, but becuase of 
certain methods employed, we will not release the source code - we want 
tio buy some time.

In general, you will find the kernel of the propgations consists of 64 
equation sets of the form:

       Bi=(Bi+Ci MOD Di) Mod 256             Large prime numbers  
       ENCRYPTEXTi=OTP[Bi] XOR PLAINTEXTi    Encryption
       OTP[Bi]=ENCRYPTEXTi                   Makes the OTP Dynamic

Where the intial Bis, Cis and Dis are all randomly selected from a 
tables of 2048 random prime numbers, the 5600 bit OTP is used to make 
the selections from the 6144 prime numbers, Dis are always larger than 
either Cis or Bis. The Cis and Dis are also different prime mods of 256, 
there might be some repeats but not many from a selection of 64 from 
a set of 6144. The effect is that you put a plain text character into the 
system and the envcrypted character is XORed against a random character and 
the resultant becomes a part of the dynamically changing OTP. 

There is a little more to it but that is the essence!

We would be most interested in allowing the cyberpunks to examine the 
program and use it as they like. We will provide source code for the 
propgation kernel, generating the large pseudo OTP from the real OTP - 
Actually there are two real time pads involved - a user oriented one and 
a message oriented one, nut that os only used to secure a user and for 
some smoothing operations. But that is the gist of it.
