Subject:       To All Plaintiffs in Online Decency Lawsuit

To all Plaintiffs in the Online Decency Lawsuit:

This morning we filed the lawsuit in Philadelphia.  Judge Buckwalter,
to whom the lawsuit was assigned, held a hearing this afternoon on our
motion for a temporary restraining order to prohibit enforcement of
the Act.  The Government agreed at argument not to enforce the
"indecent" and "patently offensive" provisions of the Act for 7 days. 
We count this as a victory.

However, the Government did not agree not to eventually prosecute
for material available during the next 7 days.  Thus, we believe
there is still a risk.  With regard to the abortion provisions, the
Government conceded that they are unconstitutional and will not be
enforced.  We will not be satisfied on this matter until they so
stipulate in writing.  The Judge gave the Government until Wednesday
to respond in writing to our motion.  He will then rule on our
motion.
