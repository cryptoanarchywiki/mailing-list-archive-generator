What the cookie mainly does is allow a normally stateless server to
maintain state while using a normally stateless protocol, letting
the client machine store the state data at the cost of some extra
transmission and parsing.  If the cookie data is kept separate
for separate web pages, this gives you more privacy than having the
server keep the same information, since you can see it and maybe
change it.    (The documentation indicates that you _can_ do that,
but it looks like the amount of separation you get depends on
the cookie-generating-user's choices of options.) 

As a separate note, it looks like cookies will be bitten by the Year 2000
glitch; anybody who bakes cookies between now and late 1999 that
wants them to expire early in 2000 should probably just give up
and go for 12/31/99 expiration....
