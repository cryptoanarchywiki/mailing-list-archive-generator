Brian,

While I agree with your point of view, I must inform you that your word is
one of the "Seven Dirty Words" and that you have thus violated the
Communications Decency Act. There are several self-admitted minors
(including several high school students) subscribed to the Cypherpunks
list, so use of such indecent language as the above is a violation of the
CDA on the face of it.

I presume you will not be allowed to prosecute yourself.
