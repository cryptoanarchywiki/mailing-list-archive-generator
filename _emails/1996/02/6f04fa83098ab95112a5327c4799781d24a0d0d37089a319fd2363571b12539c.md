Greetings from the Electronic Frontier!


As you likely already know, on Feb. 1 1996 the United States House and
Senate voted on and overwhelmingly passed the Telecommunications Act almost
immediately after being reported out of committee, before the public was
able to read, much less comment upon this bill. 

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), decries the forfeiture of free
speech prescribed by the sweeping censorship provisions of the
telecommunications "reform" legislation

EFF is launching a campaign using a blue ribbon as a symbol to visually
communicate support for free speech in the electronic world.  As a provider
of content on the Internet we invite you to join in this awareness campaign
by displaying a link to our "Blue Ribbon" page where we will update what is
happening in the effort to preserve free speech. 

Pictures, HTML anchors and information on the progress of the campaign are
all available from http://www.eff.org/blueribbon.html. 

Don't wait in silence. Please join the fight against Internet Censorship!!
