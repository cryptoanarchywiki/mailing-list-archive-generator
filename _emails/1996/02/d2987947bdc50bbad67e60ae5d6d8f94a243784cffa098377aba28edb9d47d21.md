Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, will debate Cathleen Cleaver of the Family Research Council
TONIGHT (Thurs 2/15) on PBS's 'News Hour with Jim Lerher'. (Formerly the
MacNeill/Lerher News Hour).

Check your local listings for time and channel.

Cleaver and the Family Research Council were strong supporters of the Exon
"Communications Decency Act." Topics to be discussed include the CDA, court
challenges, the recent announcement by Compuserve to un-block Usenet access
and provide parental control technologies to CIS subscribers, and other
issues relating to Internet Censorship.

it out the pipe).
