While talking with Alan Olsen about the impending Telecommunications Decency
Act, a thought struck me: one of the groups that's really going to be hurt
by this is pagans. Me, I'm one o' them Christian types; it's my anarchism
that'll get me on lists. But insofar as cypherpunks have contact with pagans
(and aboriginal American groups and the like), probably there are a lot of
folks who should be ramping up for privacy right away.
