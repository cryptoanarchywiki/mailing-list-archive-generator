Lipka. Details are in the usual news sources, such as Reuters
(http://www.excite.com/Bulletin/), under Net Directory in Netscape.

No CP relevance that I can see, except that Lipka didn't use remailers to
protect his identity when he tried to reestablish contact with the Soviets
()who were actually FBI).

Lipka was a low-level 20-year-old when he worked for the Army, probably
assigned to the Army Security Agency (considered part of the NSA).
