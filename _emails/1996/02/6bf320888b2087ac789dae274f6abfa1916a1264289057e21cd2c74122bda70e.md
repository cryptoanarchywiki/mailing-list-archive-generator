 I'm pleased to announce the opening of a new Anti-Virus oriented Web Page.

                          http://www.a1.com/cvhd

  This page allows the download of the latest versions of ALL the popular
 DOS, WINDOWS and WIN95 Anti-Virus Software as well as links to EVERY major
  Anti-Virus software developer or distributor in the world. On Line Virus
 Encylopedia, Anti-Virus Tutorials and other utilities are available as well.

   The page also contains VERY extensive links to Encryption, Privacy,
    Military, Intelligence, Government and Law Enforcement Web Pages.

 Look for the addition of a new "On Line" real-time Anonymous Pre-mailer with
   remailer chaining capabilities to be added in the very near future.
