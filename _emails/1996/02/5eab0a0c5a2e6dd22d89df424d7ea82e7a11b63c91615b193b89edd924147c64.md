You clearly did more than merely vote, as even the LP has no way of knowing
who you voted for. Maybe you registered formally as a member of the LP,
maybe you made a donation, maybe you volunteered your name. Whatever.

But suggesting that by voting for Ed Clark you got on a mailing list is
unlikely in the extreme.

-Tim May, who once dreamed about Geraldine Ferrarro and got beg letters
from the Democratic Party for the next year!

Boycott espionage-enabled software!
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
