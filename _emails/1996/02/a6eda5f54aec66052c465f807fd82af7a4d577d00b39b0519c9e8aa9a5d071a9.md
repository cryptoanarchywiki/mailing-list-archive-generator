<sigh>  Well, I suppose that if there is anyone who is most opposed to the
opinion you expressed in the paragraph above, it is myself.

I believe:

1.  Governments will no longer be "necessary," if they ever were.

2.  Protection will no longer depend on having a "government."

3.  Anonymous networking technology will protect our rights, to the extent
they can be protected.

4.  Your statement, "...anarchy is a massive step backward..." is absolutely
incorrect.


Note for the others:  I am forwarding this person a copy of my essay.
