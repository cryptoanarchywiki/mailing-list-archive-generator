Exactly. Catharine MacKinnon, for instance, has called the EFF and other
Rimm-debunkers part of the "pro-pornography power block" which
represents the "howling fury of the pornographers protecting their
penises and their wallets."

The Family Research Council, which wrote today's Newsday today, has
launched similar attacks. The FRC is run by Gary Bauer, a former policy
assistant to Reagan and a former undersecretary at the Department of
Education. Now he heads the FRC, the DC-based lobbying extension of
James Dobson's "Focus on the Family." Dobson's history includes serving
on the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (the Meese
Commission). Bauer also embraced Marty Rimm's cyberporn study as gospel,
calling the ACLU and EFF "porn industry apologists" who are "taking
cheap shots at this comprehensive study."

ObCrypto: Yes, Know Your Enemies and work with the natural enemies of
the religious right, such as groups like the ACLU and the FEN. The
theocratic push to outlaw nonescrowed crypto is next.
