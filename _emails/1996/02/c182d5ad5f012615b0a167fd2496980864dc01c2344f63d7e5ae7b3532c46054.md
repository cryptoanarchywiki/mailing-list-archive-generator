You could try but I don't think you would succeed.  I have problems doing 
OCR on faxes with a top of the line OCR program.  Don't tell me your 
trojan horse is going to be able to OCR images that are designed to be 
hard to OCR.

Here is an example of an imagemap for secure number entry.

Since this is inherently a visual thing, I thought I would cook up a 
graphic on the web siince you cannot do this via email easily.
