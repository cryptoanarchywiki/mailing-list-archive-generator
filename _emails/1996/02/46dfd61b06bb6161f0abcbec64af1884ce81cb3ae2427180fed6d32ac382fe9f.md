Has anyone heard any developments on the forthcoming Visa "Cash" cards? 
Release date or other info? (for those who haven't heard of it _is_ 
anonymous, can be refilled at ATMs. Supposedly in a test release in Atlanta.)

Has any attempt been made to remove the "munitions" classification from 
cryptographic materials. It seems a lot of our legal difficulties start 
there...
