Unfortunately, it would also:

*  Require government registration of computers and databases containing
information about people (whether these computers are used by business or
individuals).  This eases regulation of computers and future confiscation.

*  Reduce market efficiency by making it harder to match buyers and sellers
(because neither could easily find out about he other) thus causing higher
prices and poorer people. 

*  Do nothing to protect personal information from the government which
would get to collect more of it than ever in the course of enforcing data
protection laws.

If you don't want people to know things about you, don't tell them.
