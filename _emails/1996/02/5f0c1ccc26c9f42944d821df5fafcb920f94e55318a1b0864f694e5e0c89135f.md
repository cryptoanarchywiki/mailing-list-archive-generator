Uh, okay, sorry.  See, I wrote the response for you, and at the last minute
I realized that I might as well include it to the list as well.   Yes, it is
"off topic" but I thought it was interesting reading anyway.  In addition, I
gave the list 12+ hours of "warning" and asked if anybody objected...  All I
got was an "attaboy" from Dr. Dmitri Vulis.

As for the inclusion of your private note:  sorry again.  But at the time,
it just didn't occur to me that you'd object to this.  "Nettiquette" is new
to me.
