I've file-attached a first attempt at something like this to Robert Hayden
(the original poster.) It's the international 'no' sign superimposed over a
drooling baby.

If he likes it and is able to post it somewhere, he's free to do so. I'd
post it myself, but I have no web access (not yet, anyway).
