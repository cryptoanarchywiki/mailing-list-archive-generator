what if I had written some code which doesn't function properly unless
certain indecent words were in the source code and then put the code
on the WWW :).  Would that violate Congress' Despotic Action? 

What if when you looked at the text on a 80 column screen and because
of line wrap it said something indecent otherwise it was
unintelligible?  It seems that no reasonable person would go after a
person for that but then aren't we talking about selective
enforcement.
