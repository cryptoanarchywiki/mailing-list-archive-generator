Yes, that's true, but they also allude to "a large number of randomly
spinning dice" [rotors?] of which some are selected by contents [perhaps]
the autokey stream.  This from a discussion held with the POTP people.  The
allusion to the numerous 'dice' is what suggested to me a similarity with
the new [unknown but perfect, of course] system.  The autokey of POTP was
supposedly only part of the scheme....
