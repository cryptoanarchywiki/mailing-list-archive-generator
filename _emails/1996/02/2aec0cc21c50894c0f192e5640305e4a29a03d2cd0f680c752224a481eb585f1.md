The Feb 16, 96 edition of the Baltimore Sun announces that a computer
program similar to one used to attribute unknown poems to William
Shakespeare has been turned to solving the mystery of who wrote
the best selling book, _Primary Colors._ The work was apparently
done by Donald Foster a professor at Vassar College who discovered
that both Joe Klein and the author of _Primary Colors_ used these
adjectives quite often:

especially, entirely, fiercely, incredibly, mortally, particularily,
precisely, profoundly, reflexively, relentlessly, seriously, subtly,
surprisingly, ultimately, utterly, vaguely, wistfully

More information will be published in an article slated to run in the
copy of _New York_ magazine that goes on sale on Monday. This article
seems to be the major source for the Sun piece.

If Joe Klein, a well-known political writer, is indeed the author, it
is clear that he didn't learn one of the first lessons of Washington.
If you're going to leak information or quotes to the world, make sure
you use the diction of your enemy. That's ventriloquism Washington
style.
