Perry: I plead necessity. 
 
"The reason I posted my latest tract on why all men are rapists to the
cypherpunk list was so that I would have plenty of practice in case I ever
find myself in a society trying to argue against fundamental rights. I need
to practice arguing against these things under less stressful circumstances
of the current US. Without practice, I won't be able to argue for civil
liberties smoothly and thus might have to obey bad laws in a society
without those liberties. This could put me in jeopardy under those laws.
Necessity defense."

Other than that, nothing is wrong with it, Duncan. Within limits you can
argue in court whatever the judge lets you argue. I am not sure that the
judge would even listen. 
 
I also suspect that if you relied on this defense you would rapidly be
convicted. But that,of course, is something you have the freedom to do.
