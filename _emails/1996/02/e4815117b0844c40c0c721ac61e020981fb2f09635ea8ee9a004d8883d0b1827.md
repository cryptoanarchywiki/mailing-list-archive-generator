Nothing, except biometric methods (fingerprints, retinal scans, electronic
signatures (the pen type), DNA, etc.) That is, if the credential is
transferrable by transfer (not a syllogism), then it can be transferred.
If, however, the credential needs some input from a local biometric input
device, then this makes it harder to transfer the credential.

Unless the biometric device is bypassed....

(Likewise, Carol could log on to the illegal activity and "let Bob watch."
Another form of bypassing viewing credentials.)

There are interesting questions here....mostly I think of the "True Name"
as only another credential, but this is a complicated argument to make, and
I don't have the time right now.

(Also, Perry is even now composing a "what does this have to do with
cryptography?" perrygram.)
