I'm counting my blessings for not suffering carpal tunnel syndrome yet, so
I'll chime in here before we hear back from Strata.

Assuming shutdowns continue at the same rate, which is a rather large
assumption that I happen to doubt.

So much for the-net-as-I-know-it, where people don't have to call outside
the country just to log in to the net. Most of the people I want on the net
are very unlikely to do this.

Presumably the govt. can use all the same means everyone else will be using
to find ISPs. They can also go around tracking physical net connections etc.,
which is out of reach for most folks.

Meanwhile the govt. will have coerced *.gov and *.edu and the corporate
sites to establish and enforce restrictive local use policies.

(0) Strata did not claim that the net is not anarchic.

(1) Do you really believe that the net "doesn't consider itself anarchic" ???

Some mores are mostly bullshit. "The other ones are complete bullshit."
It is entirely consistent to defend everyone's right to his/her own set of
mores, and still attempt to convince some people that some of the mores they
observe are crocks. Many of the net.prejudices are particularly absurd,
counterproductive, and worthy of change, IMHO.

Uh, I guess that's why there's no need for anonymizers, pseudonymizers, etc. ?

I'd be interested to see the documentation of the number of peasants in 
the U.S. (or elsewhere) who have done anything like this. Documentation of
the number of peasants who could manage the technical details would also
be interesting.

And of course, all peasants have plenty of disposable income to spend on
long-distance phone charges....

That's nice, but are you seriously claiming that the portion of the average
set of voters in a Congressional district that strongly agrees with you on 
those issues matters a whit in a Congressional election ?

But the USG has to go out of its way to ignore creeps like Bob Dornan, just
for openers.

Well, for openers the USG can saddle all DNS companies with onerous
legal obligations. Let's not forget the stories we've heard about the
wiretap equipment set up at various telcos. Maybe it's high time for the
USG to _give_ a monopoly to InterNIC, or an ambitious competitor hungry for
market share.

For many people, yes.
