  marketing works, and companies have to use it to stay profitable.

I would not mind if fv made bogus claims in their press releases.  
People expect that in press releases.  But I think that they should 
keep their press releases on their web site, where we can ignore them, 
instead of disguising them as "discoveries" in netnews.

  So, what do you think of their product?

No client or potential client of our online mall has ever asked us
to implement fv payment.  Everyone seems happy with credit cards.

I think that the people at fv could see what was happening, and this
ill-considered post was a desparate attempt to make everyone take fv
seriously.  In my case it had the opposite effect.
