I seek to censor no one.  I prefer to confront racisim whenever and wherever
I see (read) it.  Mr. May embarassed himself with his denigrating application
of the word "Jap" to describe the Japanese people after demonstrating a gross
lack of knowledge and sensitivity about Jews.  It is NOT a matter of "political
correctness" unless YOU and Mr. May believe refraining from addressing an
African-American as a nigger the moral equivalent of sucumbing to "politcal 
correctness".

a> with this, I suppose I have been entered upon your "list" of

All three of you would be flattering yourselves if any of you thought you made
anybody's list.
