Here is a fragment of html that points to several online money or payment
systems.
The first two, SEPP & STT, are the two credit card protocols from the
previously competing camps and out of which the new standard, SET, is
supposed to emerge. STT and SEPP are vague in different ways. Perhaps their
offspring will be more completely specified. They both hide the credit card
number from the merchant. I would be pleased to receive further such URLs.

SEPP;
STT;
NetBill 
Cybercash, and
Ecash.
