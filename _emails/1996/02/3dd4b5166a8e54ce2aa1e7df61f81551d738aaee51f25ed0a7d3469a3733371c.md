Utter rubbish. You can look at the source code and easily convince
yourself that there is no backdoor. I have personally done this for the
key generation bit, and I know others who have done it for the
on-the-fly encryption. Also, 2.6ui (old version) was based on 2.3 and
interoperated fine -- it had no back doors.

What 2.6 *did* have was a built-in incompatibility with old versions, in
an attempt to make people upgrade to a version which got Phil out of
some patent-raleted hot water.
