I just heard on WBUR (NPR) here in Boston that our own L. (I know his real
first name now...) "Futplex" McCarthy was busted by the UMASS diginarks for
putting "Nazi material" on the internet. This must be one of those
Nazi-mirrors I've been skipping articles over...

They were pretty hysterical, NPR. Maybe we should call him "FUDplex" in
honor of his newfound notariety...

;-).

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
