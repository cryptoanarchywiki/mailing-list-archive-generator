And why don't you stop cluttering up the list with supposedly cute stuff
like this?

The couple of fairly short messages I've written in response to comments by
Perry are *as nothing* compared to the tons of verbiage in the Jim Bell
flame wars, the VZNUri/Detweiler flames, and even the Black Unicorn vs.
Netscape battle.

(If anyone can point to examples where I have engaged in protracted--more
than a couple of short messages--flames, please send me pointers to these
examples in private mail. I claim no especial morality, but I do think I've
stayed out of ongoing flame wars. I haven't even commented on
"assassination politics," even though it's just a watered-down and
poorly-thought-out version of what I wrote about in 1988...easier to just
delete the ramblings.)

And yet people like Bob and Uni feel compelled to throw their two cents in
about what a spectacle this is.

Get real.
