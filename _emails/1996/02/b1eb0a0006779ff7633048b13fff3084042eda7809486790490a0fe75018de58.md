It is Infocalypso.

Infocalypso is a new dance involving laptops.  It is similar to clog
dancing, except the laptops are hit together in a rhythmic fashion while a
lively beat is played on magnetic drums.  It is usually found in countrys
which have alot of spare laptops.  It was made popular during certain MIT
social gatherings and EFF meetings. The dance has gotten more and more
violent as the speed of laptops have increased.
