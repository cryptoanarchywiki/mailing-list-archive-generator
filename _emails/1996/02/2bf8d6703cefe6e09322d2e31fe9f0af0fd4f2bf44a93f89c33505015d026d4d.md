According to radio reports here, the French government has just announced
it's intention to pressure the European community to create 
international laws to control the Internet.

This is in the wake of the net publication of a certain book that had
been heavily censored in France.

Does anyone have any more details - has an actual policy been put forward
stating how they intend to control the net? And what do/will the laws
cover?

Bofur.
