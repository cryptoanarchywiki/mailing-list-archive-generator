You're clearly confused. I was responding to an accusation that I was
defending seeking somebody's death simply because of a disagreement of
OPINION.  My comment was intended to remind the reader that it is the
ACTIONS of a person which justify the self-defense; not simply the
disagreement.  

You falsely imply that a person can't be correct in his assessment that his
rights were, indeed, violated.

Since you just got through misrepresenting my position, probably
intentionally, it's pretty hard to take the rest of your opinions seriously.

You're wrong yet again.  Let's see, tallpaul needs a logic lesson:

Let's suppose I _believe_ my rights are being violated.  While that, in
itself, does not guarantee that this is CORRECT, on the other hand it
doesn't mean that it is INCORRECT, either.  You're falsely implying that I
was ignoring the issue of correctness; I wasn't.
