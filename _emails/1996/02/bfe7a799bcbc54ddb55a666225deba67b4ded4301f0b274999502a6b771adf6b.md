Whether there is a conspiracy to convince people to believe things
about PGP or not, there is no need to take PGP's characteristics on
faith. You can get out the source code and read it.

No change in algorithms occurred between PGP 2.3 and later versions,
so any claim that it was made breakable at that point cannot be made
on the basis that computing power is somehow now able to crack it when
it could not do so before.

I'm sorry, but I am bringing knowledge to the discussion. It is my
personal knowledge that PGP was built as well as the people who built
it knew how, and that it is believed to be free from major flaws by
them and those who have examined it. I do not believe that PGP is
totally bug free, and a subtle flaw in, say, the PRNG, or some other
spot, is not impossible. However, no such flaws were put in place
deliberately, and if such flaws exist they have escaped the notice of
literally hundreds of people examining the source code for problems.
