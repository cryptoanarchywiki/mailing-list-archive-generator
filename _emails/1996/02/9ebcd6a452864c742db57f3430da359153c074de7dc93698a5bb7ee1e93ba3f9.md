This is my perception, too, though I haven't been in Corporate America for
almost a decade. Still, I would encourage people to take this position,
that "we don't need no steenking key escrow!" (to borrow again the B.
Traven phrase I used yesterday)

Bravo!

And we should all remember, again, that basic observation: even if "key
escrow" is needed to recover *stored* files, it sure ain't needed for
*communications*!!

The only entity that really has a compelling need for "key escrow" for
_communications_ is Big Bro himself, nto companies or individuals. Think
about it.

TIS is just playing the shill role for Big Brother and the Holding Company.
