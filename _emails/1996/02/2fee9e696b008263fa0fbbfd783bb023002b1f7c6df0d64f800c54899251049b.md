Farley Mowat (author of such pinko-Canadian books as "Never Cry Wolf")
had also "violently attacked" the US Air Force.  He was annoyed at them for
flying
nuclear bombers and such on training runs over Canada, and shot at them
with a small rifle (I think it was a .22 or something equally dangerous to
airplanes at 35000 feet...)  They didn't like it.
