A single electronic timer.  The lengths of wire from the timer/detonator
to each piece of explosive was exact - thus, the pulse reached each piece
of explosive at the same time. 

I think Clancy used multiple timers, each triggered at the same time.  I
don't think that one would need but one timer, though.
