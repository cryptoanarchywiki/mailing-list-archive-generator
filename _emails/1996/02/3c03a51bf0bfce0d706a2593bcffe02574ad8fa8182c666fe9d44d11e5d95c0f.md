Suppose you didn't trust the from fields in usenet articles, and you
wanted to index everything so that you could pull up articles that appear
to have been written by the same person.  How would you go about doing
this?  Would you set up n statistical measures for text, assign each
article an n-tuple, and look for points that are near each other? 

Isn't this a similar problem to indexing satellite photos or 
fingerprints?  How good are the spooks at doing that sort of thing?
