A number of years ago, the Political Correctness folks at AT&T cleaned up
the termcap and terminfo files that were distributed with Unix.
You really can't talk about the Hazeltine terminal without using the word
"brain-damaged", and the "2621-ba" was redescribed as "broken arrow keys" :-)


                        Bill, who spent far too much time tweaking termcaps....
