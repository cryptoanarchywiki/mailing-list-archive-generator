"Protecting the right of privacy"? If I tell Joe Bob that you welshed on a
debt made in the past, something that the person you welshed on has
informed me of, how is this a violation of your right of privacy?

Better yet, abolish the laws about so-called "Fair Credit Reporting."

If Tim's Pretty Good Credit Reporting knows that Joe Blow filed for
bankruptcy in 1975, by what right should men with guns come to his file
cabinets and announce that he may not reveal true information that is older
than, say, 8 years? Facts are facts. Not just for 8 years, or even 20
years. Debts incurred 30 years ago and not paid may still be useful bits of
information in deciding whether to extend credit to a person.

And even possibly untrue things are not the main justification for the
FCRA. The FCRA is _not_ primarily designed to correct wrong information,
but to place time limits on correct information. It limits speech. And it
interferes with rational economic decisions.

Fortunately, strong crypto and cyberspatial data havens will make
enforcement of the FCRA increasingly difficult.
