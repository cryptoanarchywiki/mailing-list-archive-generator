  "In the US, ViaCrypt pays the royalties to Ascom for every copy of

  about.  Personal users of MIT PGP in the US also have nothing to worry 
  about because Ascom's published position deals with 'commercial use'. The 
  only people who need to do anything are people overseas using PGP 2.6i or 
  2.6ui in their businesses.  They need to license IDEA from Ascom."

As another data point, I (sitting in Australia)
attempted to buy a licence through the Web page
and encrypted emailed credit card, and in return
received a phone call from Zurich. I was informed
that IDEA was not patented in Australia, and my
attempt to pay was appreciated but declined.

Europe generally has patent coverage I believe.
