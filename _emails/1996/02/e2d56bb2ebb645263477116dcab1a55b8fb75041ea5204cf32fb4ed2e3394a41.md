Bob,

I'm confused by these two messages, as a non-lawyer (but I realize you're
also a non-lawyer).  How can RSADSI, on the one hand, expect to be able
to assert trade secret status over RC2 (with a warning to "...any person
who acquires, discloses or uses this information...") while at the same time
encouraging the world to examine and better understand the (illegally-
published) RC2 code?  To my lay mind, I cannot see how one can reconcile
your two messages.

I'm not trying to be cute or play lawyer.  I'm honestly confused as
to just what RSADSI's position here is.
