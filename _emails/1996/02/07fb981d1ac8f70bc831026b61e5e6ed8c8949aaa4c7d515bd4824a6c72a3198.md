After doing a total reinstall of my system (don't ask) I discovered that I
don't have a copy of the Aegis PGP Shell distribution archive anywhere. I
attempted to grab it from http://iquest.com/~aegisrc as listed in the docs,
but the site doesn't exist.

Doesn anybody know what gives and where I can get a new copy of the archive?
I really like this shell and haven't figured out how to otherwise integrate
PGP with EudoraPro.

Any other suggestions are also welcome.
