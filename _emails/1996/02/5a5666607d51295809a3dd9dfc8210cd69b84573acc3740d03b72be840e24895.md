I agree that this is a problem but I still feel that an individual should 
have more rights than a corporation. It is true that there is a 
possiblity of the owners of the corporation may have their rights 
diminished, but you have to balance this against the protection that they 
get by being incorporated. Either the files belong to the corporation or 
they belong to the owner or shareholders. If they belong to the 
corporation, the individual wins the rights contest. If I follow your 
scenario, one need only form a corporation to avoid responsibility for 
any violations of the law.
I wish to reiterate here and now, that I am NOT advocating government 
access to computers or files. I am simply suggesting that data 
corporations should be required to take responsibility for the data that 
is in their care. If they do not take such care, they should be subject 
to sanction.
