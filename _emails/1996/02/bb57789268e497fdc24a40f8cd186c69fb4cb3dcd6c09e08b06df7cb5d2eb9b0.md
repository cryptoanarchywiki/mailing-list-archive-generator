I've tried to stay out of this thread, as it is mostly off topic, but I 
do have one suggestion to people setting up clones of the zundel site. 

There's a fine line between defending someones freedom of speech, and 
actively promoting that speech. The reason these mirrors have been set up 
is to counter the restriction on access to the original site that has 
been put in place by Deutche Telecom; however, in addition to defeating 
this restriction, this approach also makes the material more widely 
available than it was previously, which could be seen as crossing the 
line between defence of free speech, and active promotion. 

One approach that would stop this line being crossed would be to 
configure the clone servers to only allow access to sites in Germany 
affected by the original restriction. This compromise defends freedom of 
speech, but does not give the site any wider promulgation than it would 
have had had no government restrictions been emplaced.

Simon
