Has the list really sunk this far into trolling? Obviously we're
starting to see dreck posted simply to draw people into fights.
If I want a religious war, I'll hang out in soc.culture.pakistan, 
thank you. <Insert Perrygram here.>

Oh, and for the still-clueless, posts like the following have 
about as much of a foundation in reality as your average Zundelsite.
Don't even bother replying.

True, there are risks in generalising from the actions of one individual 
to the group as a whole.  Nevertheless, where Islam is concerned, there 
are so many individuals behaving badly that we are justified in thinking 
the whole religion a force for bad.

Doubtless, I shall be told that "true Islam" is "true tolerance", "true 
freedom", and even "true apple pie".  I may be told that the horrors of 
actually existing Islam - remember this phrase, or something like it? - 
are all somehow the fault of the West.  But the fact is that most Moslems 
venerate old men in beards, who think that anyone who disagrees 
with them about God should be put to death, that a woman with a 
clitoris is a kind of devil, and that Western classical music is evil.

By my standards, these people are disgusting.  My only dispute with Tim 
is in our manner of expressing our disgust.
