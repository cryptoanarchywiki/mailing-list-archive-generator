   2-22-96. TWP:

   "CIA Can Waive Prohibition Against Using U.S. Clergy Abroad
   for Covert Work."

      A controversial loophole permitting the CIA to recruit
      American journalists as agents also allows the agency to
      waive a similar 19-year-old ban on employing clerics or
      missionaries. An official also disclosed that CIA
      regulations prohibit recruiting employees of members of
      Congress or congressional committees "without the
      approval of the member" for whom they work.

   "The CIA: No Cover For Failure."

      Now we know why the CIA, the NSA and the DIA and all
      those other spook agencies that get $25 billion-plus
      every year can't bring down Saddam Hussein: They have
      not been able to use journalists or priests -- the
      latest the Washington/New York national security
      establishment has come up with to ride out the lean
      years after the Cold War. In a justification for
      continued massive spending on spying, the experts ask us
      to focus on the extraneous and stupid, rather than look
      at the obvious.
