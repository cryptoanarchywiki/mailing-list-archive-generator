Oh, hey, no problem.

You're not the only one, despite the explicit reference in the document.
Whether I like it or not, this industry is largely centered around and
run by men.  I always got a kick out of people's assumptions that my
resume and my writing must "naturally" belong to a guy.  Apparently
the dominant paradigm thinks I'm holding my own in the rat race.

I learned to take it as a compliment years ago; the same thing
happened in 3 out of 5 phone screenings for job interviews.  
What's really been entertaining is where we did email prescreening and
I showed up for an interview and got to watch someone's mental
transmission popping its syncromesh for a moment.  <grin>  They always
recover quickly and continue the shift into "interview mode", and I
get that nice warm glow of having broadened someone's horizons. 

Cheers,
_Strata
