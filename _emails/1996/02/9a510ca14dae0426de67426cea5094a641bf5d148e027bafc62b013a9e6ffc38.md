OK, I give up. Took off the head phones  connected to the TO, went downstairs,
set the V-15 Type II on the Dual 1019 to 7/8 gm. Patched to the Pioneer 1500TD
amp feeding front AR-5's and rear AR-2ax's, cranked to "pain" and spun some
vinyl.

Full Tilt Boogie Band, Columbia PC 32168 (first one I found in the pile -
believe the original was on a album with her standing spraddlelegged with
the big grin - is here *somewhere*. Credit on th record was K. Kristofferson
and F. Foster. (Had to go downstairs, contrary to popular belief, everything
is not in my den 8*).
						warmly,
