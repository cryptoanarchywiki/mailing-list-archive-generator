  Sites that use the Netscape Merchant system for online malls use cookies
for keeping track of your "shopping basket".  I don't think they use
persistent cookies, so they will never get written to the file on disk.
Such sites include the netscape online store (merchant.netscape.com)
and the MCI mall at www.internetmci.com.

  It is an artifact of the database library that we are using.  The
certificates and keys are not actually being written each time.
