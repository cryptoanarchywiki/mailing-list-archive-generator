Frankly, I though much of what you said was not really in the form of an
argument, and thus did not bear response. At any rate, see my message prior
to this, in which I have gone back and responded to everything I didn't
explictly address before.

It helped that Americans formed an army and otherwise took up arms against
the limeys. (ObImpunity: I'm a limey by birth.) Ah, I see you are about to
address the difference between flying-lead wars and flying-electron wars
below....

I disagree. I presume that Jim Bell will now pounce, call me a "fucking
statist" or some such, and induce many folks to killfile the remainder of
this thread. I don't plan to respond to anything he says about this.

I disagree. (This level of debate seems rather unproductive.)

> you, you must refrain from harming those who do not oppose you.  

I disagree. It seems to me that all sorts of "innocent bystanders" etc.
get mowed down, usually at no noticeable detriment to the mowers. Since
this thread is already doomed, I'll plough ahead and suggest that lots of
people who didn't oppose the U.S. were obliterated by Fat Man and Little
Boy, and yet the Enola Gay's mission(s?) was/were effective for the USG.

Probably true.

See my comments above.
