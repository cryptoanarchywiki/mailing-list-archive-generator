Since it wouldn't do me any good to write code (I've _seen_ my code, it's not 
pretty), I'm writing in English instead. :-)

I've started work on what I currently call Privacy Without Tears, a guide to 
PGP and related programs pitched specifically at a novice audience. I would 
appreciate comments, particularly in the fact-checking line (more on this in 
a  moment). I'd also appreciate anyone who feels like it passing the URL I'll 
give in a moment on to crypto newbies and seeing if they can follow the 
instructions and get good results.

So far, I've only written an intro and a section on PGP. Now I'm working on 
a section on DOS and Windows front ends.

I'm only discussing software I can actually use on my own system, so 
explaining to me about the merits of tools for other OSes won't do any good. 
But if you have useful information about such, I'd be happy to link to your 
pages. Likewise, I'm deliberately not getting in a number of technicalities 
up front - only in the last section, for instance, will I explain about IDEA's 
role in PGP keys. This is for _novices_, the people who have as much need to 
protect their privacy as any of us but fewer clues.

One thing I could really use is a short - paragraph-length - discussion of 
probable times to crack keys of various lengths.

The URL (for the moment):

http://www.aracnet.com/~bruce/privacy/privacy.html

Thanks in advance for constructive comments!
