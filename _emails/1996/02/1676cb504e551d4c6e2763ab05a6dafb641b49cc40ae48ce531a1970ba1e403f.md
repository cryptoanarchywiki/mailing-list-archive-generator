FYI. Might be amusing. I'll probably go, if I can find a free moment.

BREAKING THE CODE
by Hugh Whitemore
Based on the Book: Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges

The private life of an extraordinary and brilliant man becomes the means of
his destruction in this dramatic story, which won acclaim on Broadway. At its
center is Alan Turing, the mathematician and British war hero who broke the
famous German Enigma Code, giving the Allies the key to winning World War II,
and yet was persecuted by his government for his sexual orientation. This
portrait of a complex, visionary man torn by society's conflicting rules is
chillingly powerful.
