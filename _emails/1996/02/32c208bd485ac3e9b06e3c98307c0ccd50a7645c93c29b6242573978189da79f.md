Interesting idea. Trends may be externally visible, You would probably
want to normalize it, and you would find that there was quite a few
deterministic elements of network load -> delay.

Oh, did I mention clock granularity?

In short you really aren't going to get 'random numbers' from such a
scheme, but that's not to say you couldn't have fun playing with it,
you might even find some use for the ways of calculating immediate
network load around a node. Especially with regard to interception of
packets and allowing for time discrepancies whilst doing so.

Altogether off topic, but could maybe be developed into an idea with,
maybe a 30% change of being Perrygrammed. Keep working.

Bounce me the code, could be interesting
