Mr. Hayes MAY have used a condescending tone but you have exposed your
racist roots again.  First you embarass yourself with you lack of knowledge,
sensitivity and understanding about all things Jewish and now you insult an 
entire race with the use of the word "Jap".

Stick to cypher related topics - - - - - -  You're elevating the Ugly American to
another level altogether.
