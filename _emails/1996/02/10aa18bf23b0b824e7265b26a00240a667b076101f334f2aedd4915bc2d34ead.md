Ok please view my three points fromn the standpoint that so much of the 
total traffic would be affected by at least one, that "uncontrolled"
communications would be minimal.

I think you had better review the concept of "property rights". Unless you
have a contract that says you can, or can establish "expectation", the
property owner who allows you to use their equipment may control how it is 
used.

>>3) communications with anyone (Internet merchant, etc) who says "this

That is fine but what if MasterCard refuses to accept this method ? (Not
saying they will, just "what if" ? You are free to use digicash if you
want but is not "legal tender for all debts public and private".

>Comments?  Bring 'em on! :-)

I dood it.
