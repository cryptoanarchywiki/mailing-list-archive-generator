   2-23-96. WSJ:

   "H-P Acquires Most of Internet Security Firm."

      SecureWare technology is used by the Pentagon to
      safeguard transmission of military secrets. The firm's
      team of about 40 programmers is "a substantial fraction 
      of the hired guns available in the on-line security 
      world" who snake oil an extra virgin security that not 
      even hackers can cross. Hackers would question that; 
      they have a remarkable history of eventually figuring 
      out ways to get past advances in faked chastity.

   "Netscape Will Issue Fix for Flaw Found In Browser System."

      The company confirmed that Princeton researchers found
      a security flaw in the "applets" created with Java, but
      said the flaw was minor and that the company will issue
      a software fix for it next week. Jeff Treuhaft said
      exploiting the flaw would require extremely skilled
      hacking. Marianne Mueller, Java security engineer, also
      said the chances of such hacking occurring are "remote."
