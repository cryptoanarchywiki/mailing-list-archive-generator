Presumably, you'd need a Chinese-approved identity key in order to get
packets into the country.

Hold on..

Assuming we really believe the net is a good thing, if the Chinese block
it, they're hurting themselves.  We don't need to get bent out of shape.
They could as easily refuse to connect to the rest of the world.

The more they repress their population, the more their population will
want to rise up in protest -- maybe not this millenium but probably in
the next.

All we have to be sure of is that we don't let the Chinese dictate to us
what content we can provide.  It's like the CDA.  The Chinese might choose to
implement a nation-wide SurfWatch at all connection points at its borders.

...their problem, IMHO....
