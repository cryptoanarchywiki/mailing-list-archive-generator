I agree these problems will continue to show up from time to time.  With a
large security kernel, you will have security bugs.  However, if the fixes
come out in a week, then the hacking potental is greatly reduced.

A very good idea.  An advantage for web based products.

This is all true.  However, from what I know, in this case you would need
to know the details of the flaw, and be able to generate a java bytecode
stream which takes advantage of the problem.  If the fixes come out
quickly, then your attackers don't have much time.  However if they
discover the flaw before you do you are in deep shit.
