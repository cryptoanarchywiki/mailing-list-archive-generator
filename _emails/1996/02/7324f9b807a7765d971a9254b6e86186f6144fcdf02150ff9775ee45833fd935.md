        well, remember, Congress has a prime function that their "duty" 
    is to legislate a bunch of laws for _us_ to live buy; and, that being 
    done, to legislate a second set of laws, more to their liking, for
    _them_ to live by and collect $5M pensions, and 100% health coverage
    at the very best for the rest of their lifes.
