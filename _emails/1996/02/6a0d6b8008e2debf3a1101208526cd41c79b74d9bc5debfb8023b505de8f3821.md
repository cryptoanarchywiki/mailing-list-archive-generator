Historical facts and or personal interpretations thereof were never called in to question by me.  I took umbrage with Mr. May's insulting, insensitive and racist comments about Jews and the Japanese.  Whether Mr. May's is personally embarrassed by his public display of ignorance and bigotry matters not.  He did indeed embarrass himself on an 'International Stage'.

I may not know shit from beans (actually I do) but I do know cultural  insensitivity, racism, bigotry and ignorance when I see it displayed so blatantly.  I encouraged Mr.
May to return to topics 'cipher' before further embarrassment ensues.  I urge you to do
likewise.
