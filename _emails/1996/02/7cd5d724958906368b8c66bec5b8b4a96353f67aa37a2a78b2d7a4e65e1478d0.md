To the message_fronter of the public majordomo lists I control
(win95netbugs and win95netbugs-digest), I have temporarily added the
following, as a way of limiting my liability:

############################################################################
## WARNING: Any use of this mailing list in violation of section 502 of   ##
## the Communications Decency Act of 1995 will immediately be referred to ##
## the appropriate authorities for prosecution. See http://www.eff.org/.  ##
############################################################################

I will of course remove this notice, or maybe move it to the footer, 
after a couple messages go by with the notice prepended. No need to be 
*totally* obnoxious.

I'll probably also post a notice that all submissions to
comp.os.ms-windows.announce (I'm the new moderator) must comply with the
CDA. Hmm, I haven't had time to put up a "submissions guidelines FAQ" yet. 
This could be fun, but I will keep it clean.
