Recursive-capable formats are clearly the way to go; the difficult problem is
deciding how many layers of recursion to do while decoding (e.g. all the way
down,
or one layer at a time asking the user for each round), which is largely
a user-interface issue rather than a platform issue, though it also lets you
build limited-purpose tools instead of an all-singing, all-dancing camel
of a platform.

Unfortunately, the formats being considered give you too much known plaintext
to make triple-encryption a useful way around the 40-bit-key silliness.
*/MIME has MIME headers, PGP has the (expendable but present) ------BEGIN.
A new MIME header like
        X: parameters
where parameters are ignored would limit you to three bytes of known plaintext,
which is at least a start.

The prevailing philosophy is also that we need to build an API toolkit
so PGP components can be easily included into programs.  This means that
PGP will inherently no longer be able to decode all the PGP-based messages,
which may have different layers of other material wrapped around them.
PGP/MIME is probably one of the better excuses for doing so, as are
improved keyring-handling applications.

Where can we find the new specs for MSP?

Will it be GAK-enabled?
