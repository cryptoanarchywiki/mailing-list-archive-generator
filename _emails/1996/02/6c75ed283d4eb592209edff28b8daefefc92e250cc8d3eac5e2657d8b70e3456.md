Seems less likely ... you would need qualified surgeon, etc. ... my
suspicion is that biometric devices are actually more susceptible to bypass .

For that matter, if you can replace an amputated finger, how about
transplanting a hand?  <shrug> 

I think the distinction between an implanted device and a naturally occuring
biometric is 1. not that important, 2. not all that large, anyway.

My point is -and I think this pretty obvious- without the "something someone
IS" 
as opposed ot "HAS" there is no stopping the exchange of credentials.  And
then as you go to "HAS", it's just a matter of how far you want to raise the
bar.

I like that idea of surgically swapping tokens ... where do I find the Dr.?
Assuming s/he's illicit, then where do I get the $?  And the person to swap
with?  What's in it for him/her?
