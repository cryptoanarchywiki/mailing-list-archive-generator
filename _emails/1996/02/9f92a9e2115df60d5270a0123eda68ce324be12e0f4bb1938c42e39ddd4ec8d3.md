It should be possible to fake a source address.

Also, if you want to traverse a firewall from the inside, its usually
pretty easy to do with mail, or over telnet.  Stego in ping would show
up in a firewalls logs more prominently than a lot of mail.

Err, you can put up to 1500 bytes into an ICMP echo request, if its
properly implemented.
