    attila sez:

	It is not whether paralax does not know shit from beans, but that
    he proves to all that he would prefer to censor TCMay and James A.
    Donald than listen to their opinions, despite the fact he posted his
    own rather trivial and absurd point. 

    political correctness and the liberal news intrepretations of "all
    men are created equal" with reverse discrimination, destruction of
    the work ethic for the dole, and the New World Order whose need is
    more and more cheaper labor, even to the point of disenfranchising 
    whole element of America society to achieve a worker's underclass is 
    the shit part of beans and shit.

	with this, I suppose I have been entered upon your "list" of 
    enemies of the 'statist' nation along with TCMay and James A. Donald,
    and that my prejudged conviction and sentence requires me to write
    30,000 lines of debugged C source code before the end of this year. 

	how about 30,000 lines of debugged Ada source for you?  --while
    I add you to procmailrc:

    	    :0:
	    * ^[FRST].*paralax
	    assholes

	have a nice day, hopefully enlightening

I took umbrage with Mr. May's insulting, insensitive and racist comments about Jews and the Japanese.  Whether Mr. May's is personally embarrassed by his public display of ignorance and bigotry matters not.  He did indeed embarrass himself on an 'International Stage'.
