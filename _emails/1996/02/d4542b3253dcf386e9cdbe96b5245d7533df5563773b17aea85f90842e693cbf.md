For the record, this includes me (Yes, I work for HP now).  Please
note that most of the story content is, if not wrong, at least poorly
stated -- so what else is new?  Also, the specific quotes there --
including the "hired gun" quote above -- are from an "industry analyst"
not from anyone at either HP or SecureWare.
