Of course, in a market environment, you can do better than that.
Because there are almost always other people who want what you want,
and barring major government interference, there are ways to find them
and usually people interested in offering you and your fellow-travellers 
the service you want.  Most of the time, there are economies of scale
that make it cheaper to get the service together rather than each doing
it yourself, and you can decide whether to do it as a cooperative
or buy it from the vendor who's supporting the bunch of you.

ObCrypto: Even _with_ major government interference, there will be ways
to find your fellow-travellers.  Anonymously.
