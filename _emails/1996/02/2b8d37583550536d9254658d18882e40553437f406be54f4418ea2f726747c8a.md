So you get the fun of attacking this straw man called "libertarians" without
any responsibility to identify any actual people it might include other than
a handful of folks that the vast majority of us think are kooks. And you've
also acquired the remarkable mental power, apparently, to discern who is or
is not an LP member based on their posts here.

Neat tricks.

But until they're joined with a willingness to look at a wider range of
libertarian posts than the fragment that feeds your pet peeves, I reserve
the right to be impressed.

And yes, this is off-topic. So this is all I have to say about it.
