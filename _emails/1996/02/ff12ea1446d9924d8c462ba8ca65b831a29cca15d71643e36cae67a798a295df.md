Yes, it is.  It was a big surprise (like, absolutely nobody knew what
was going on except for two or three VP's, and the CEO) (and I guess
the board, of course, but they mostly don't hang out around here
anyway).  Lots of ex-IBMers sorta freaked a little, but I think
everybody's happy.

Uhh, well, I might have to sell myself a little...  But thanks very
much.
