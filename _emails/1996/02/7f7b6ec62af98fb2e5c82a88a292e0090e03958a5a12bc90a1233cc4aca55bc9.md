Hardy har har!  This sounds like a joke, right?  Anything you WANT the 
Constitution to have said, "is not mentioned in the Constitution because it 
was a given."

Thanks for making me laugh...at you!

This statement is internally inconsistent.  If the speech is truly "free," it 
is (and should be!) unconstrained.  To whatever extent it is constrained, it 
is not entirely "free."  Now, even if we all agree that SOME speech should 
be limited, don't try to use this argument to allow the government to 
restrict ALL speech!

Here you get wacky again.  You first make a true statement, and then come to 
a false conclusion.

Logic lesson for Padgett:

There are at least three categories here:

1.  Government restricts communication.
2.  Government neither assists nor restricts communication.
3.  Government assists communication.  (through stolen tax dollars, BTW.)

Your first sentence in the paragraph immediately above simply says that item 
3 is not required.  That is a true statement.  However, you falsely 
(apparently deliberately?) suggest that item 2 cannot exist; the only 
alternative is item 1.

Get real, Padgett.  Wake up.
