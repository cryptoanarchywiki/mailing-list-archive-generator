Now I have a firmer grasp on the dynamics of escalation. ;)
        A couple of notes. (1) The people Mr. Strassman CCed in his first
response remained CCed throughout; one of them is his co-author, William
Marlow (Senior Vice President, Science Applications International
Corporation [SAIC]). (2) He hasn't responded to my last mail, and probably
won't, at least in private; obviously, he's free to respond to it on
Cypherpunks. (3) I find his claims to understand and properly represent the
arguments for remailers to be, er, lacking: claims like "remailing
capabilities are operated [...] as a public service, almost always at no
charge because it costs so little to set one up," the absence of the
standard penet-type arguments--about support-group discussion re sexual
abuse etc.--speak for themselves, imo.
        Anyway:

>Greetings.
>        Your article on remailers <http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/
>anon-remail.html> was fascinating.
>        The "connection" you draw between disease and techniques of
>anonymity is arbitrary and tendentious: in place of a careful, sustained
>analysis of anonymous remailers _as such_, your article relies on a
>bizarre rhetorical substitution of disease for anonymity--"Information
>terrorism poses a threat; anonymity prevents punishment; the fact that
>legislative and policy bodies aren't dealing with the issue reminds me of
>the history of public medicine; therefore anonymity is a disease like
>AIDS; Russian criminals are using remailers; this is how remailers
>work..." This isn't an argument--it's a hodgepodge of free-associations
>and very peculiar allegations. What evidence is there that "the Russian
>(ex-KGB) criminal element" (whatever that is) constitutes a *statistically
>significant* segment of remailer-users? If they aren't statisticaly
>significant, why mention them? In the absence of any specific evidence, I
>can only assume that this claim is pure fantasy--like the confusing
>association between "AIDS" and "terrorism." Certainly, both are bad for
>society, but so are many other things--littering, starvation, and poor
>workmanship.
>        If you plan to develop your work on remailers further and present
>it to governmental agencies and NGOs, please take the time to *understand*
>the arguments of remailer advocates, rather than merely quoting them at
>length. You'll be doing yourself a favor--because, really, the only
>sections of your article that seem to make much sense are the quotations
>from people who develop and maintain remailers.

> Dear Mr. Byfield:
>
>Thanks for your comments about our remailer paper. I believe a few points
>are in order in response to your observations:
>
>1. It does not seem that you have finished reading the paper. There is a

>spectrum of opinions and beliefs of those who develop and offer remailer
>services. I am satisfied that I have represented fairly the views of those
>who see in remailers the defense of privacy and civil liberties. I also
>conclude that remailers are here to stay.
>
>2. With regard to the evidence of that remailers are used by the criminal
>element, and particularly by the Russian (ex-KGB), I am satisfied with the
>evidence I have seen so far. As court proceedings become unsealed, everyone
>will have an opportunity to examine that evidence. Meanwhile, you may wish
>to browse for recent stories with the keywords <Citicorp> and <Cybercrime>
>for such disclosures.
>
>3. In your letter you employ a technique which is not appropriate for the
>conduct of a civilized discourse. You start by  attributing to me
>statements which I did not make. Then, you proceed to debunk them. Let me
>illustrate:
>
>I did not use the expression "statistically significant" in describing the
>use of remailers by the criminal element. Therefore, your argument "...if
>they aren't statistically significant why mention them?" is both false as
>well as logically inconsistent.
>
>Your debating style shows similar flaws by avoiding facts and arguing your
>own constructs of what you attribute as my views. It is only because of the
>importance of this subject matter that I have decided to respond to your
>"flame".
