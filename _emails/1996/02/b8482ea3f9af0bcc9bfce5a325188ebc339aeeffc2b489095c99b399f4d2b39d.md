Traffic analysis can happen even with only one address. (just spam attack
the one, or whatever)

You can protect yourself somewhat by putting lots of latency into your reply
block, including random. You could have one nym point to another.

ObMindWandering
Since expiration dates were "supposed" to be added to type I, and there's at
least some spam-detection code, why not add "Hi, I'm reply block #XYZ. Watch
for spam attacks from me." warnings inside the reply block. (To be lost on
the next hop, of course)

If good spam-detection code ever catches on in type I, it would be nice to be
able to trigger it yourself. 

ObSnakeOil: Post your source code or go away, you're wasting bandwidth.

ObNoiseInGeneral: skipping it in leaps and bounds. MUCH quieter. =)
