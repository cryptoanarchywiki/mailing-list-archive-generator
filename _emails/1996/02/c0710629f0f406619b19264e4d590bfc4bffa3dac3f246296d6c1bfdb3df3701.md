Reminded me of that scene in "Sneakers" where they steal the guy's keycard
to get in.  Risks of leaving that sort of thing in one's jacket pocket. 
Also, lots of high-tech places have at least one automated
unattended/unmonitored entrance, so if you get a keycard, it's easy to get
into the place (my current employer has unattended entrances with
cameras).  Even with the manned entrances, the ones with just a
receptionist/secretary, they seldom check that the picture matches the one
on the badge, so even if they've invalidated the badge, the receptionist
will still more than likely let you into the place if you wave your
keycard/badge around. Highlights the need to *still* concentrate on
physical security and authentication - all the electronic toys just make
security folks lazy.
