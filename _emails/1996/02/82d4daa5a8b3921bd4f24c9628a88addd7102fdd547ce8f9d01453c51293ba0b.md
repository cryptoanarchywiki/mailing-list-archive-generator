I thought this clip would be of interest. Just in case you were not sure 
which directionship censorship on the net was heading. Anyone remember Joe
McCarthy?

Goosestepping in cyberspace

The politics of the Internet make strange bedfellows. When the German
government moved to bar German Internet users from downloading material
on a neo-Nazi net site, the free-speech-in-cyberspace crowd reacted by
downloading the stuff and posting it all over the net. Joseph Goebels
would be proud.
