I was musing over this phrase, "a government rules by consent of the governed"   [.......]
does it mean, "majority of the governed?" how exactly is consent expressed?
.......................................................................................

.  How exactly is consent extractedH^H^H^H^H^H^ requested?

.  When exactly is consent identified? 

.  How exactly is government applied to the consentees? 
   (caning, jailing, fines, etc.)

.  How exactly do consentors change methodologies when they suddenly realize that they, too, can be subject to their own device?

.  Why should non-consenting citizens live with governing methods which in fact conflict with the pursuit of those three human virtues:  life, liberty, happiness?

Supposedly, government is devised for ruling the "unruly";  a matter for definition and (dis)agreement which can provide endless hours of amusement for authoritarians, especially in court.

I hear tell that many who are no longer amused are now learning the many uses of encryption.  Thus the list.  

(end of my comments)
