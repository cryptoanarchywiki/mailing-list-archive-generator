Few days ago I found good page for it.

  http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/FAQ.shtml#License

This page said that:

 + Can I use PGP 2.6.3i for commercial purposes?
 + 
 + Yes, you can, but you need to buy a separate license for the IDEA
algorithm used in
 + PGP. (RSA is not patented outside the US, so you don't need a license
for this
 + algorithm.) IDEA licenses can be purchased from Ascom Systec AG in
Switzerland.
 + (The licensing of the IDEA algorithm was formerly administrated by Ascom
Tech, but
 + this responsibility has been transferred to Ascom Systec. Please, do not
contact
 + Ascom Tech about this matter!) The fee is charged on a per-user basis as
follows: 

# Sorry, this is about 2.6.3i, not 2.6ui.

P.S.
Now I'm studying MacPGP...
