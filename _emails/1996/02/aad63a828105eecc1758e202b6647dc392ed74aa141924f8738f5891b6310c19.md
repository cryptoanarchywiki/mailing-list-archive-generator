We've been doing some work with the thing and have actually got a crypto 
product built for a customer.  Some things to know:

1.  It' unbelievably slow.  Key generation on this things takes an order 
of magnitude longer than what you see in the "average" PC environment.  
Encrypt/decrypt times are equally extended, but aren't that obnoxious if 
5-20 second/'average' e-mail message lag times don't torque your user.

2.  Buy the PersonaCard API Developer's Kit or you're hosed.  It's the 
only real source of relevant data.  It's got Visual C++ source in it, 
etc.  You also can then contact Nat-Semi with questions.  You can order 
the thing (I think it's around $100, but I'm not sure) from:

iPower Technical Support
iPower Business Unit
National Semiconductor Corporation
1090 Kifer Road, Mail Stop 16-225
Sunnyvale, CA 94086-3737

3.  The drivers suck.  They appear to be essentially a "protocol stack" 
that gets loaded into memory (LOTS of memory) and then they conflict with 
just about everything.  Lock ups are common.  These things have to load 
in sequence, before anything else, or they won't work.  We have not been 
able to get them to peacefully coexist with any other PCMCIA drivers, nor 
with such things as CD-ROM drivers or tape backup drivers.

Summary:  A fun thing to play with, interesting toy, but probably not 
something you can actually make useful (yet).

Enjoy.
