Brilliant.

You could even set it up so that it also proxies your smtp out going, and
compares each destination to a list of people you want to automatically
encrypt to.  I suggest a list because while you may have some people's keys
in your keyring, for a variety of reasons they may not want to receive
trivial pgp mail.
