	How about a lawsuit by the atheist against the site? Since the CDA
claims that such material is harmful, and tries to make it illegal, such a
lawsuit would appear to have grounds - especially if the atheist has a child
that is "surfing the Net." Now, they're unlikely to _win_, but the atheist
can cost them some money _and_ make the CDA look stupid. If I were in the
American Atheist Foundation or some such, I'd do such a lawsuit against a
Christian Right organization that had supported the CDA.
	Of course, the selective enforcement will be a good argument in favor
of the law being unconstitutional.
	Crypto relevance? Criminal laws aren't the only things that a
crypto-anarchial system will make less effective. Civil lawsuits (under things
like libel) also will be. I'd call this a good change.
