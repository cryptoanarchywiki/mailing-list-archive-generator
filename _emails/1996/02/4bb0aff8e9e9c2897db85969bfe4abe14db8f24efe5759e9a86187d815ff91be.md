I only just managed to go through my mail backlog and read
Simson Garfinkel's original Mercury News article. I was appalled 
by FV's double standards in evaluating security risks. Both First
Virtual and real-time transaction models (without encryption, or 
with it e.g. Netscape) require that the recipient not be compromised. 
FV relies on e-mail (domain names); Netscape relies on IP addresses. 

IP addresses are much harder to intercept than domain names
(which can be hijacked - see my earlier posts). This essentially
means that while e-mail can be mis-routed, IP packets can't.
Additionally, plaintext e-mail as well as IP traffic can often be 
sniffed along the way. 

FV demonstrated, through it's "card sharp" or whatever, that
real-time transactions are vulnerable to sniffers on the recipient's
own machine. Of course. We all knew that. But the mistake is to
assume that FV isn't _equally_ vulnerable to that threat. If you
can write a trojan that will somehow get privileged access to my
machine, trap my keystrokes, and identify my credit card number,
you can certainly write one that will, sitting on my machine:
    "intercept the user's electronic mail, read the confirmation 
    message from First Virtual's computers, and send out a fraudulent 
    reply" 
(to quote from Simson's article). Simson further quotes FV's Lee
Stein: "A single user can be targeted, Stein said, but ''it is very 
difficult. . . . There are too many packets moving . . . to too many 
different machines.''" - which is of course equally true for real-time
Netscape transactions. 

Simply put, if there's a program sitting on your computer with
privileged access, it can read your mail, hide it from you, and reply,
as easily as it can read your keystrokes. Even simpler: if there's
a privileged program on your machine, NOTHING IS SECURE - not SSL,
not FV, not plaintext credit cards, not PGP, NOTHING.

This is old hat, and FV has shown nothing new with its one-sided
stunt; the only reason there has been little hype recently about
card-sniffing trojans is that trojans and viruses and the rest of
their ilk have being dying of exposure in the media, ever since the
Internet Worm grabbed headlines years ago.
