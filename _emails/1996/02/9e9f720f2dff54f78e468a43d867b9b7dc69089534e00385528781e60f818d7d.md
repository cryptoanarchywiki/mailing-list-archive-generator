It gets even worse by my reading of this thread.  They send out the first lot
of pseudo-OTP via some *nominally* secure channel, but then the send you
the subsequent months via the Internet.  (Presumably encrypted with one of
your existing keys.)

This adds up to a system that isn't event a pseudo-OPT.  It's just a conventional
rotor-based cryptosystem, with an unevaluated implementation.  Break one message
containing a batch of new keys and the entire system is defeated forever.
