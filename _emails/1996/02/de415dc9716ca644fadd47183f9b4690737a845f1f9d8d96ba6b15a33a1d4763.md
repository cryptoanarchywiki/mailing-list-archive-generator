Norton pcANYWHERE and Stac ReachOut both claim to use encryption
though I don't have any details of what that encryption is.

However, if you use a direct telephone link to communicate, your need
for encryption would mostly be in the event that your telephone lines
were being tapped (though these products can also be used over most
network protocols including IP and IPX).

btw:

In general, when I speak with PC software vendors (product managers)
they almost always talk about how secure their products are but never
have the details (either, "oh, that's proprietary" or else "I'm not sure, I'll
have to get back to you on that...")
