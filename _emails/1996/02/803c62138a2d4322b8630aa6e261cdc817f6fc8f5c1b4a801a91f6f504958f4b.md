It is irrelevant if you keep copies of the OTPs or not. The point is that
you might. There is no way to prove to me or anyone else that you don't
keep copies. [why this is true is left as an exercise to the reader].

I would not trust anyone outside my company to create keys for us. I would
urge any others interested in keeping their data inaccessible to outsiders
to exercise the same fundamental caution. There is no further need to look
at IPG's source code or algorithms.

As I said, end of story.
