}Frankly, Jim, the only reason I haven't torn apart all the utterly

}"concepts" is that they are *all* off topic and I do not participated
}in the discussion of off topic postings.

Frankly perry, you're a fucking child and I can't remember reading anything
intelegent from you in this list at all.  Jim Bell at least contributes
ideas.  You generate garbage.  I'm a patient man, but you've finally done
it.

PLONK!

"Prohibition... goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to
control a man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things
that are not crimes... A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very
principles upon which our government was founded."

On the meridian of time there is no injustice, only the poetry of motion
creating the illusion of truth and drama.
