Here's a quick script I hacked together in the last few minutes to sign 
web pages.  Very simple-minded, it nonetheless does the job.  If you want 
to see how it looks in action, visit http://dal1820.computek.net

#! /bin/sh
#
# signit - use PGP to sign a web page
# Written 02/08/96 by Ed Carp (ecarp@netcom.com)
#
# This could conceptually be used to sign (and optionally verify)
# shell scripts, etc.  The possibilities are endless...
#

#
# Set up some variables...
#

# Change this if you're so inclined...
PGPHELP="http:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/Computers\/Security_and_Encryption"

# Look for a line that starts like this...
LOOKFOR="This web page has been signed with"
ADDLINE="$LOOKFOR <A HREF=$PGPHELP>PGP<\/A>.  To see the digital signature, click <A HREF=$1.asc.html>here<\/A>."

#
# First, we need to make sure that the page hasn't already been signed...
#

F=`grep "^$LOOKFOR" $1|wc -l`
F="`echo $F`"
# If it hasn't already been signed, add signature line
if [ "$F" = "0" ]; then
	echo Adding PGP signature HTML to document
	echo "s/<\/BODY>/$ADDLINE<\/BODY>/g" > $1.temp.$$
	echo "s/<\/body>/$ADDLINE<\/body>/g" >> $1.temp.$$
	sed -f $1.temp.$$ < $1 > $1.$$
	rm -f $1.temp.$$
	mv $1.$$ $1
fi
pgp -asb $1
# Add rudimentary HTML
echo "<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>PGP Digital Signature of $1</TITLE></HEAD>" > $1.$$
echo "<BODY><I>PGP Digital Signature generated `date`</I><HR><PRE>" >> $1.$$
cat $1.asc >> $1.$$
echo "</PRE></BODY></HTML>" >> $1.$$
mv $1.$$ $1.asc.html
rm $1.asc
echo Done.

"Past the wounds of childhood, past the fallen dreams and the broken families,
through the hurt and the loss and the agony only the night ever hears, is a
waiting soul.  Patient, permanent, abundant, it opens its infinite heart and
asks only one thing of you ... 'Remember who it is you really are.'"

According to the Communications Decency Act, these are the words you may
no longer use in your Internet correspondence:  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt,
cock-sucker, mother-fucker and tits. The use of shit, piss, fuck, cunt,
cock-sucker, mother-fucker and tits, may now earn you a substantial fine
as well as possible jail time, should President Clinton sign this Bill
into law.  Please refrain from using shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock-sucker,
mother-fucker and tits, to protect your children as well as others, from
their evil influence, thus keeping America "ideologically pure".
