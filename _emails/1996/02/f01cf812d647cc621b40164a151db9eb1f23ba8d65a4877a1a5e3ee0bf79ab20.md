Which simply proves my point;  money is not the limiting factor, here.

But remember, Rushdie is merely ONE PERSON.  And keeping him safe has 
consumed a lot of resources.  You don't think the government could protect 
each of their most publically hated employees to a similar level if a reward 
of, say, $20,000 were put on each of their heads.  How much could we collect 
to "get" Lon Horiuchi, for example?  Or the hundred or so agents immediately 
participating in the initial Waco incident, or the dozen or so decision 
makers immediately above them?   Etc.

The Rushdie incident is simply so far removed from "Assassination Politics" 
that it can't possibly be used to refute it; I still believe it actually 
demonstrates how much effort somebody has to go to, to protect a targeted 
person.  One targeted person is easy to protect.  10,000 would be FAR 
harder.  And the moment a few of those guys got "whacked," the rest would 
want to resign their jobs and hope they would be allowed to retire in peace.

In a sense, qualitatively you absolutely correct, but (quantitatively) 
you're wrong.  

I think the problem is that when most people hear the term "Assassination", 
they think of only the highest-level targets.  Quite the contrary; I think 
this system will get the medium and even the lower-level people FIRST, 
de-populating the government primarily by hurried resignations of worried 
people.  The remaining  people would be terrified to actually make anybody 
angry, and they wouldn't have a paycheck because they couldn't collect any 
taxes.  The whole system would collapse in a heap.
