As strange as my politics are ;-), I've never been one for political
protests, at least not since I graduated college and grew up.

However, it seems that I've done enough protesting for silly causes in my
youth to excuse me for doing one small thing about something I still *do*
believe in, the freedom to talk about what you want without the threat of
someone hauling you off to jail.

With that in mind, I'm joining the EFF, VTW, and thousands of other web
sites across the world today and making the e$ Home Page black for 48 hours.
I'm hoping that others out there will join me in making Black Thursday as
memorable as they can for the people who think that censoring the net is
even possible, much less conscionable.
