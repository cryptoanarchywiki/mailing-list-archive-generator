The parts of the Privacy Act that I remember are all restrictions on
_government_ actions, not private actions.  It's an important distinction;
even though TRW may know way too much about you, it's all information that
you voluntarily released to somebody, unlike data that the government 
requires you to give them.  And, yes, it's out-of-date and toothless.

If you're going to propose laws, you should not only think about
whether they'll do what you want, but also about what else they'll do,
how they'll be enforced, what are the side effects of that enforcement, etc.
How is the government going to ensure _non_existence of databases?
If I'm a prosecutor, and claim that you _might_ have personal data about
somebody on your machines beyond the Politically Correct Data Elements,
can I get a search warrant for _all_ your databases?  What about that
encrypted file on your PC at work?  Such things have been used to hold
personal data before (even by police like the LAPD or Stasi.)
No thanks.

If you want to require that a database exists, then a business can
demonstrate that they have it by producing it (though proving
whether or not in really includes all transactions is still difficult.)

On the other hand, if you don't make the law adequately enforceable,
you're encouraging violation and selective enforcement.

Yes!  GAKed encryption, to be sure - once there's a requirement that
you be able to produce your data for the government, they'll discover
that they need guaranteed access to data that would otherwise be guaranteed
inaccessible by strong encryption.

>o reduced propagation of personal information

A much stronger way to increase privacy is to eliminate one of the most
popular unique keys used by these databases - the Social Security Number
which the government requires you to give almost anybody who gives you money.
Give each taxpayer a pile of taxid numbers (either cryptographically related,
or just randomly generated and stored in a big tax-department database)
so you can use a different taxid for everyone who needs one, making it
impossible for anybody but the government to correlate them.
