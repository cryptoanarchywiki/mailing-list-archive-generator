   "If you ever wondered how a particular computer technology 
could attract the interest of the directors of three 
intelligence agencies, the heavyweights in the computer 
industry, a gang of programmers turned freedom fighters, and 
the President of the United States, you need look no farther 
than Building in Big Brother. This book outlines the next civil 
liberties battle in the United States."

   - Marc Rotenberg, Electronic Privacy Information Center

   
   "One-stop-shopping for even the most sophisticated analyst 
of the policy wars over cryptography."

   - A. Michael Froomkin, Associate Professor of Law, 
University of Miami Law School

   
   "Lance Hoffman has compiled an extraordinarily useful and 
well balanced collection of materials on cryptography and its 
applications. This book will instantly become a definitive 
compendium."

   - Peter G. Neumann

   
   "Though Lance Hoffman is a dedicated opponent of current 
government policy, he has assembled a volume that should be -- 
and will be -- on the desk of every cryptographic policymaker 
in Washington. He has accurately recorded the many voices in a 
debate that will profoundly affect our future, for good or ill, 

well into the twenty-first century. This book is an important 
contribution to the history of encryption. It is an even more 
important contribution to those who are struggling to shape 
that history."

   - Stewart Baker, Steptoe & Johnson (formerly General Counsel 
to the National Security Agency)


   "An authoritative source of political writings by the major 
players in the crypto revolution."

   - Philip Zimmermann, Creator of PGP

   Includes Steven Levy's peerless "Cypherpunks vs Uncle Sam" 
and other Shortstop-proof cpunx ammunitions.
