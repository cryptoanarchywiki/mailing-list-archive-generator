I haven't seen Goodlatte's legislation, but I can safely say he
doesn't have our privacy rights at heart. Bob Goodlatte (my local
representative) was the CC toadie partially responsible for putting
"indecent" back in the CDA. I don't trust him any further than I can
spit on him.

I'll keep an eye on this. I'm very suspicious of his intentions.
