   The same people who are running the anonymous http proxies. If you've
got a T1, it's not much of a problem. And for some people, privacy is
a selling point, like Sameer's c2 system.  Also, let's say NOW
wants to put up a site with abortion information. They could pay a set of
anonymous proxy servers for the "service" of providing a anonymous mapping
service for them. And of course, all the various CyberPorn companies,
many of whom may have their business illegalized, will want to pay for 
such a service. Especially, if the proxies are offshore.

   I'm not really concerned about who will want to provide the service.
I think there are many individuals who would. I'm concerned about making
the software available. Inline images could always be turned off in the
script if need be.
