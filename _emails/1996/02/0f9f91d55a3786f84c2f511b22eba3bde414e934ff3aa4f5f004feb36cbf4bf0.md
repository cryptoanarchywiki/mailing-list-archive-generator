The following is an excerpt from a bill proposed to become law in the
State of New Mexico. (It did not succeed.) I wonder if the same sort
of thing should be enacted to apply to the testimony of economists?

"A BILL REGULATING EXPERT TESTIMONY IN COURTS. BILL____.

AN ACT RELATING TO EXPERT TESTIMONY IN COURTS; REGULATING THE
TESTIMONY OF CRYPTOLOGISTS AND COMPUTER EXPERTS IN THE
HEARINGS OF CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS IN COURTS; BE IT ENACTED BY THE
LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO;

When a cryptologist or computer expert testifies during a criminal
defendant's penalty hearing, the cryptologist or computer expert
shall wear a cone-shaped hat no less than two feet in height for the
duration of the hearing. The surface of the hat shall be imprinted
with stars, moons and lightning bolts.

Additionally, the cryptologist or computer expert shall be required to
wear a white beard no less than eighteen inches in length for the
duration of the hearing. The cryptologist or computer expert shall
punctuate crucial elements of his testimony by stabbing at the air
with a wand no less than one foot in length.

Whenever a cryptologist or computer expert provides expert testimony
regarding the defendant's methods, the bailiff of the court shall
dim the lights of the court room and shall administer two strikes to
a Chinese gong."
