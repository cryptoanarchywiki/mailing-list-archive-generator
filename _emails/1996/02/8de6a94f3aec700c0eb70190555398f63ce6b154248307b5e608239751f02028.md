It's real simple folks. Turn the damn set off.

If parents wont accept the responsiblity to monitor what their kids 
watch, then they get what they get. If I don't want my kids watching 
television when I am gone, then I take the remote with me, as that is the 
only way my TV works.

The V-chip, like every other type of electronic lockbox devised to date, 
is nothing more than a band aid trying to cover the real problem - lack 
of attention paid to one's children and what they are doing. A 
govermental solution designed to regulate and legislate morality. History 
has demonstrated that every time a government makes attempts to enforce 
what is considered the basic tenants of civilized behavior then the game 
has already been lost. The people and the politics have become so 
corrupted that no form of democracy will survive for long - as it is 
dependant on the individual's willingness to abide by the principle of 
personal honesty.
