4-1-99. NYT:

   "Congress Passes "Children's Protection and Safe Information Highways" Bill"

      "In a vote of 479-12 in the House of Representatives and 93-5 in the
Senate, the "Children's Protection and Safe Information Highways Bill" was
sent to the President, who is expected to sign it on Thursday.

      "The Bill criminalizes the possession of unauthorized cryptographic
programs and extends the Telecom Act of 1996 and the Digital Telephony Act
of 1994 to regulate the new cyberspace frontier.

      "Attorney-General Louis Freeh pushed for the legislation, citing the
growing use of cryptography by dissidents and criminals. "We are hoping
Congress will next pass the "Secure and Decent Cyberspace Bill." This bill,
nick-named the "Crypto-Kingpins Bill," will subject traffickers in illegal
crypto to the same harsh penalties meted out to drug kingpins. "While it
may seem harsh to execute a person for possession of a key greater than 60
bits, we must consider the terrible consequences for our children of people
writing down things the government cannot read," Freeh said.
