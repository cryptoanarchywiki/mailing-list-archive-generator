>Welcome to the Zakat homepage at http://www.ummah.org.uk/zakat/
>which has been setup by the Bait al-Mal al-Islami (BMI).
>
>Bait al-Mal is the public treasury of the Islamic political system (state 
>or nonstate). BMI acts as the finance department function of an Islamic 
>political authority (IPA).  This BMI in the UK operates under the 
>authority of the Muslim Parliament (the IPA in this case).
>
>An IPA may or may not be directly responsible for the management of 
>Mosque(s). The IPA may or may not be directly responsible for relief 
>work. These activities may be carried out indirectly by other agencies 
>operating under the authority of the IPA or supported by it.
>BMI does welfare work in UK and externally.
>
>Zakat collection and distribution is the responsibility of the IPA (which 
>may be a Khalifate or in its absence a regional entity in your part of 
>the world).
>
>Zakat collection and distribution is not a free-enterprise do-it-yourself 
>project. Khalifa AbuBakr (RA) went to war against those people who did 
>not want to pay Zakat to the central authority and who instead wanted to 
>do it 'their-way'.
>
>Any one can setup a registered charitable organization; anyone can't 
>setup a religion or Deen and do it 'their-way'.
>
>The Zakat page is at http://www.ummah.org.uk/zakat/
>
>The online Zakat payment facility is at:
>http://www.ummah.org.uk/zakat/pay.htm
>
>The long term strategy is that we Muslims need a major presence in
>cyberspace. This would include intelligent agents (robots, sheriffs,)
>roaming cyberspace collecting Zakat funds and Jihad funds and doing other
>things we can't yet imagaine. Islamic Gateway http://www.ummah.org.uk
>(and affiliated net entities) is only a primitive foundation for future
>workers to take further. If you want to help realise the dream or want
>free webspace for public service projects contact info@zakat.org.uk
>
>If you are running a BMI function in your part of the world and you wish 
>to co-operate or obtain further information on the UK BMI then contact:
>
>Dr Muhammad Ghayasuddin MMP (*),
>Secretary/Trustee,
>Bait al-Mal al-Islami,
>109 Fulham Palace Road,
>London W6 8JA, UK
>Tel +44 181 563 1995 or 1994 (fax 1993)
>
>WHY is BMI/MP doing this: policy questions to Mohtashim Shaikh MMP, BMI 
>trustee responsible for the online Zakat service at:
>mohtash@ummah.org.uk
>
>Technical questions to the IG chief designer, Brother Ibrahim at:
>query@eurolink.co.uk
>
>(*) MMP = Member of Muslim Parliament
>
>Flames to Mohtashim before Feb 9, afterwards to info@zakat.org.uk
>
>MP as an IPA raises both Zakat funds (using BMI's charitable status in 
>the UK) and also Jihad Funds (NOT using BMI - Jihad is NOT covered as a 
>charitable activity in western law!). Only an IPA can do BOTH Zakat and 
>Jihad fund raising. Let any 'Charity' org try and do that.
>
>Just as a personal aside: a major UK Muslim charity is a part of the 
>Saudi lobby (accountability to Mr Fahd?) whilst another Islamic charity 
>is about to get U.N. affiliation (accountability to Boutrous Boutrous 
>Ghali?). BMI on the other hand is accountable to the Muslim Community and 
>its leadership.
