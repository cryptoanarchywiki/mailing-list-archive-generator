Depends on how much you're in British databases. I imagine that when
those who desire to track your movements feel the need they'll check
with UK and European sources.

A lot of the databases are already linked up and shared. An acquaintance
from the UK who came here several years ago was able to use his debit
card in local ATMs, for instance.
