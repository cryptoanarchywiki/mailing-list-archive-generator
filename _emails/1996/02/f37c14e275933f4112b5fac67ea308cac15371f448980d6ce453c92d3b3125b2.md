Two things are wrong with the law.

1) Parents still can turn the TV off.  They don't need any V-chip or 
   bills from congress to do that.   (This obvious fact seems
   to escape every bug-eyed person)

2) The v-chip would have already been deployed as an option
   if congress hadn't stepped into the ring.  The marketplace
   saw the demand and had already developed the technology.
   Congress got it's finger in the pie and it will probably be
   2 years now before its actually deployed.  Gee thanks Newt.
