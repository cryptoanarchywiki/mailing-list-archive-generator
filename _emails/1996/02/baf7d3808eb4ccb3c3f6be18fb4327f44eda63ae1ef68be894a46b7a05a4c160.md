"Sophisticated"?  Any first-year comp sci student could do the same.  
Hooking into the keyboard interrupt is child's play.  Reading the display 
memory is even easier.  Who is this guy trying to bullshit, anyway?

Uh-huh.  So, no one should ever use a computer ever again, if this

The only thing that this post "dramatically proves" is that the poster is

First Virtual's apparant "intent" is to scare the public and panic people
into believing that they, and only they, have some sort of "magic bullet"
that will save us all from Evil Computer Geniuses.  Just another scam to
try and make money off of unsuspecting people by trying to scare them to

Nonsense.  This also implies that Windows, MS-DOS, NT, etc., are all some 
sort of "insecure platform" and they are presumably infected from the 
start.  I suppose that when Bill Gates picks himself up off the floor 
from laughing, he just might send his lawyers after you.  Maybe.

With a Windows program?  I guess it runs on every known platform, under 
every known OS.  My, that *is* one hell of a program...

I guess I'd better stop using my linux box .. it could've been infected 
with the "FV Windows Virus" ... hehehe
