Lasers DO accomplish one task.

They force the interceptor to commit vulnerable forces to the attack.
It's pretty damn hard to get into room 24Z6 @ the Fort & prove that they
are working on YOUR text -- snatched in a phonetap.

It's a lot easier to catch the two guys on a bucket truck, or the Feebs
doing a black bag job on Ames' PC. That's exactly why TPTB prefer 
Option A, the FBI wiretap act, to B.

But a more interesting question, maybe for Brian. How DO the wiretap
laws treat non common-carrier communications -- be it YOUR wire strung
from Tom to Jerry's house, or such? And where does the FCC authority
stop, and whoever regulates laser-safety start? 

I vaguely recall that some BBC competitor was going to use the
wavelength loophole to get around the Beeb's monopoly... so the Crown
immediately raised the bar up to the gamma ray level or such.
