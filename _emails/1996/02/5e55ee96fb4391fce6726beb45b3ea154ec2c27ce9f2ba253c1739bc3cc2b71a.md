Forget about Jeff, how about PGP? Put it on a rocket (I'm *sure* there's
an amateur rocket club conveniently located near the border), and off

Have I missed anything?

If you want an answer, please mail to <jirib@cs.monash.edu.au>.
On sweeney, I may delete without reading!
PGP 463A14D5 (but it's at home so it'll take a day or two)
PGP EF0607F9 (but it's at uni so don't rely on it too much)
