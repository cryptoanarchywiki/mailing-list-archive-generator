I rarely understand the points "tallpaul" makes, but this one is especially
confusing to me:

As a card-carrying "lib'ber," it seems to me that I have written more than
enough articles denouncing the CDA, making fun of it and Congress, etc. And
so have numeous other "lib'bers" on this list, including (but not limited
to) Bill Stewart, Duncan Frissell, Jim Ray, Rich Graves, Sandy Sandfort,
Vince Cate, and others too numerous to mention.

tallpaul must be reading a different list than I am reading if thinks those
he dismisses as "lib'bers" (in his other posts, and this one) are somehow
in league with the Christian Right in supporting censorship.

[This Bible excerpt awaiting review under the Communications Decency Act]
And then Lot said, "I have some mighty fine young virgin daughters. Why
don't you boys just come on in and fuck them right here in my house - I'll just
watch!"....Later, up in the mountains, the younger daughter said. "Dad's
getting old. I say we should fuck him." So the two daughters got him drunk and
screwed him all that night. Sure enough, Dad got them pregnant....Onan really
hated the idea of doing his brother's wife and getting her pregnant while
his brother got all the credit, so he pulled out before he
came....Remember, it's not a good idea to have sex with your sister, your
brother, your parents,
your pet dog, or the farm animals, unless God tells you to. [excerpts from
the Old Testament, Modern Vernacular Translation, TCM, 1996]
