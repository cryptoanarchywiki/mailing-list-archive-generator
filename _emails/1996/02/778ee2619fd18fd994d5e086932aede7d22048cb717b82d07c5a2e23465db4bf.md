  Yes, we have thought of adding such a facility, not just for security
patches, but for general release updates as well.  However some folks may
remember some discussion (I think it was mostly in other forums) about
the possibility that Netscape was "phoning home" to deliver to us information
about your browsing habits.  Of course we have never done this, but if we
were "phoning home" periodically to check for new releases it might raise
some suspicion among the more paranoid.

  I guess we could make it an option...
