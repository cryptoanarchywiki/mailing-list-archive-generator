The Nebraska-based neo-Nazi publisher who was picked up in Denmark and
extradited to Germany pretty much knew his actions were illegal in Germany,
but I doubt (sheer speculation on my part) he had ever been formally
notified that an arrest warrant had been issued by Germany and could be
exercised in Denmark.

The situation with Declan, Sameer, Duncan, and others, is even less clear.
Things are moving much faster now that the Net is the means of
distribution. I was of course half-joking about Declan visiting Europe, but
surely France could decide to throw the book at him, and any EU country he
entered (such as Ireland, judging from his name) could hold him at their
entry point and ship him off to France to "set an example."

I suspect the U.S. never officially notified that Monterrey, Mexico alleged
drug dealer that he was wanted in the U.S., and as other kidnappings of
foreigners have shown, the U.S. feels it unnecessary to formally announce
to foreigners that they may be arrested in the U.S. (or kidnapped into the
U.S.). Thus, I strongly suspect that France will not bother to notify
Declan or Sameer or any of us that they face arrest in France (or
affiliated EU countries).

In Declan's case, I suspect France wants him for the Mitterand book and
Germany wants him for the Zundelsite mirrors. The lesser European countries
will of course follow their leads.

Seriously, Declan, I admire what you've done, but I hope you don't plan to
leave the U.S. for Europe anytime soon.
