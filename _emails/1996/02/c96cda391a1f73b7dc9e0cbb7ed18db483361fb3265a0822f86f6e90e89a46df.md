Or, you can develop a public-key stego system...

ie a stego system that uses bits in specific ways depending on the 
private key of the recipient.

Something I've been thinking about, but haven't quite figured out how to 
do yet, except that one could use certain bits based on a PRNG and begin 
the message with an RSA-encrypted seed (ie the first X bits will be the 
seed, encrypted with your public PGP key).

(If anyone actually wants to code this, lemme know...)
