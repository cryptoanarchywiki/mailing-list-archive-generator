	I don't wish to get this one going on c-punks, but you will see
    shortly just how quickly the "feudal" national powers are going to 
    be able to erect national firewalls. 

	We are entirely dependent on AT&T, Sprint, MCI, British Telcom,
    and so on for nation to nation or region to region communications
    --and they in turn are entriely dependent on the various national
    governments for the _franchise_ to "enter" or operate within the 
    country. 

	telephone lines are a trickle of information --the old uucp
    when I complained when the daily _total_ traffic exceed 2 megabyte
    and the heydey of TrailBlazers.  today it's 154 Mb/sec trunks, and
    they are bogging down. the governments regulate these lines and 
    outside the U.S. most governments own these lines.

	satellites are another perfect example; the governments control
    the franchises for the up and down links and the allocation of 
    frequencies. and, who controls the satellite launches? Even the 
    European consortium is controlled --forget the Chinese and the 
    Russians!

	Is the government doing something illegal vis a vis 
    communications policy (other than the obliteration of free speech with
    CDA)?  No, but it is obvious they will, since the CDA or whatever is
    their intent and they have the power to enforce their intent --if
    nothing else by invoking FEMA, which a cornered Clinton might do. 

	the extremists are almost always ignored. we are certainly viewed 
    as extremists. nobody took the Libertarian party seriously until
    Howard Stern ran for governor of NY --and that was the circus of Will
    Rogers, not a political platform. Years of cooperative political 
    graft (the interest in the status quo) has made the two party system
    the only __succeedable__ political system in the U.S.

	eventually, only violent revolution of the masses succeeds --men
    of rational thoughts and wise counsel are easily suppressed, if not
    eliminated.

        As for the dreamers who believe the government is or will NOT
    do (be doing) something illegal, the line forms to the right for 
    reeducation.
