If people are going to criticize X.509, they ought to at least get their facts 
straight, beginning with the difference between Printable String (standardized 
around the time of the IBM 1403 printer with its 48 character print chain) and 
some of the more extended alphabets. In particular, X.500 has been amended to 
include BMPString within DirectoryString, and BMPString is essentially Unicode. 
Now, there may be some who would argue that a 16 bit character isn't sufficient 
to represent every language in the galaxy (Old High Martian may have some 
additional requirements), but as a first approximation it should certainly good 
enough. 

And one of the virtues of ASN.1 is that a compliant implemtnation shouldn't 
have to be concerned with such details as the alphabet that is used.
