In a nutshell: FUD Virtual's press release glosses over the hard part
of the attack -- distribution and collection.  Yes, the credit-card
system is broken as designed, but that's already reflected in its cost
structure.  The proposed attack will never make up a significant
fraction of credit-card fraud.

You know, FV should put out a press release warning that all
encryption-based payment systems are insecure, due to the threat of
the proposed "Chinese-lottery virus".  Bet you could get the Times to
print it...

Who would bother?  Ask yourself if you'd have been quite so excited
about this "new attack" if you were just Nat Borenstein, private
citizen, with no financial interest in a competing technology.

You wave your hands and say that "consumer machines are insecure", but
I don't think you have any conception of what it would take to get
your trojan onto "MILLIONS" of machines.  There is no historical
precedent for such an attack (no, Ping-Pong and Stoned don't make the
cut).  Your suggestions of such things as rogue GIF viewers aren't
even in the ballpark.  What fraction of the victims will expose their
credit card numbers?  what fraction will notice your trojan and warn
against it?  The ratio has to be very, very large.

I didn't see the part where you explain how this works, either.

You wouldn't have shot your reputation so badly if you weren't so
damned disingenuous about the whole thing.  Paragraphs like the above
really irritate me.
