The Sun Observer -- "An Independent Journal Devoted to the 
Sun and Compatible Markets" -- ran an article in the Feb 96
issue entitled "New technology eliminates need for keys to
encrypt e-mail messages".


Byline: Bob Harvey.  About the author:  "Bob Harvey is vice
president of the Internet Security Corp., a Lexington,
Mass.-based network security solutions provider."


Content:  includes diagrams entitled "Link Level Encryption"
in which sender transmits keys to receiver, and "Packet
Level Encryption" in which sender transmits key sto
certificate authority which transmits them to multiple
receivers, and "Synchronized Random Key Generation (SRKG)" 
a la "Power One Time Pad" in which no keys are transmitted 
and multiple recievers magically decipher messages via 
built-in encryption devices.


Am I right in thinking this is utter unmitigated
bullsh snake oil?  Does anybody have any other
dirt on this Bob Harvey guy and his Internet Security Corp?
What is his relationship with the POTP folks?  An Alta 
Vista search revealed several Bob Harveys, but none who 
matched with "Internet Security".


I'm Cc'ing this to the editor in chief of The Sun
Observer.  If he doesn't know about the cypherpunks he might
want to request some explanation...
