Could you use IPv6 / IPSP authentication to do the job?  You'd obviously
need to create network software for the various operating systems,
but for most of them it's not a big change and various well-known people
are working on implementations :-)  You could get by with something
cheap like an RSA-signed key used for a MAC with either RC4 or MD5,
reducing the problem to one RSA signature per connection plus faster algorithms.
For email, that's probably still one signature per mail message, but it's
a manageable load...
