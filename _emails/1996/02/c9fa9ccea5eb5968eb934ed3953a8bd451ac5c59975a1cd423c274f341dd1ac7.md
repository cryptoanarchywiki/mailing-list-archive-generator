True, there are risks in generalising from the actions of one individual 
to the group as a whole.  Nevertheless, where Islam is concerned, there 
are so many individuals behaving badly that we are justified in thinking 
the whole religion a force for bad.

Doubtless, I shall be told that "true Islam" is "true tolerance", "true 
freedom", and even "true apple pie".  I may be told that the horrors of 
actually existing Islam - remember this phrase, or something like it? - 
are all somehow the fault of the West.  But the fact is that most Moslems 
venerate old men in beards, who think that anyone who disagrees 
with them about God should be put to death, that a woman with a 
clitoris is a kind of devil, and that Western classical music is evil.

By my standards, these people are disgusting.  My only dispute with Tim 
is in our manner of expressing our disgust.
