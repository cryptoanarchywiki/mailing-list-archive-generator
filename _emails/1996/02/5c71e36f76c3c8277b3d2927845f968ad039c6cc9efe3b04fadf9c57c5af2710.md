I *think* that the Federal GST already applies to internet services: 7% on
all goods and services, and internet service provider as a term seems to
leave you wide open. The suggestion that this would drive out ISPs trying
to set up in NS is odd; the tax will make internet access more expensive in
NS, but with distances what they are in Atlantic Canada, there aren't many
options for going elsewhere. If it does anything, it'll drive the customers
of ISPs away, probably to New Brunswick. (Frank McKenna's government in NB
has made wiring the province a crusade, to the point where it is probably
the best-wired province in Canada, and much of it would rank against Toronto,
Montreal or Ottawa for sheer connectivity. At a CATA conference a year or so
ago, someone talking about the SchoolNet initiative remarked that, "in New
Brunswick, the washrooms had wire.")

This topic probably mainly comes up since the government of Canada is
currently making a tidy amount on the doubloonie, our new $2CDN piece.
[Rather pretty, two-tone, unfortunately, the copperish centre tends to
 come out with a little pressure, leading to the term, "pieces of two".]
Um. I rather doubt that the Bank of Canada is most worried about losing
money because people aren't using its cash any more; their greater worry
I would expect to be that they'll lose what precious control they have
of the Canadian economy.

This tenuous grip (though driven from the south) is fairly precious, and
becomes more so when faced with the prospect of Quebec trying to run its
economy without a central bank or currency.
