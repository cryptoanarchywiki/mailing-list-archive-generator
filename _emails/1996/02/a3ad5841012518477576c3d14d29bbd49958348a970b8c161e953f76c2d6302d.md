CDA means that virtually all underground or 'illegal' traffic will be
distributed via encryption.

As soon as the loony right and fundo Christians realise this, they *will*
call for legislation against encryption, and if the CDA is any benchmark,
they will easily win.

My 0.2 cents worth for the day.
