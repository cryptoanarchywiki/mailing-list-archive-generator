I believe that ACLU/EFF/EPIC have found the necessary plaintiffs for the
court challenge, but they still may be interested in others. Send me
mail and I'll pass it along. (The original call for plaintiffs went out
last fall, and the lawsuit was filed last week.)

But generally, to be a plaintiff you have to have standing to sue. You
have to be specificially hurt or negatively affected by the law. The
plaintiffs include folks who run web sites, mailing lists, and offer
other public online resources that may happen to include indecent or
patently offensive speech.

Say, the hearing when we find out if we get an injunction preventing
enforcement of the CDA is going to be this Wednesday in Philadelphia.
Anyone else want to go?
