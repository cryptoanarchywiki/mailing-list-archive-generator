For those people who have Netscape / an SSL-enabled web-browser, wouldn't 
it be useful to have secure web pages that did the following:

(1) An anonymous remailer web page, like the current ones (this one has 
    the obvious advantage that plaintext doesn't travel to the http server)

(2) A pgp-sending web page (type in key id into field, send message to 
    address given, encrypted)  This isn't a bad idea for the same reason that
    (1) above is a much better idea.

(3) Ultimately, a server that did (2), through (1).  Being able to send PGP
    encrypted email to a recipient through anonymous remailers, over the web
    with a secure browser might be PGP's "killer app" in one way or another.

How hard would this be to implement? Would it be worth waiting until the PGP 
3.0 API is released?
