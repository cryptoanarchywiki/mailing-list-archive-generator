I just forwarded my last post to some other list  favouring
- sort of - proposed privacy legislation in California. As
it may not have appeared here, and is very short, and I don't
have the URL, and I believe my response was relevant to
cpunks, I've reproduced the bill.

   Existing law, the California Constitution, provides that all

to privacy.
   Vote:  majority.  Appropriation:  no.  Fiscal committee:  no.
State-mandated local program:  no.


  SECTION 1.  The Legislature hereby finds and declares the
following:
   (a) All people have an inalienable right to privacy as
declared in Section 1 of Article I of the California
Constitution.
   (b) Advances in technology have made it easier to create,
acquire, and analyze detailed personal information about an
individual.
   (c) Personal information, including information about a
person's financial history, shopping habits, medical history,
and travel patterns, is continuously being created.
   (d) The unauthorized use of personal information concerning
an individual is an infringement upon that individual's right to
privacy.
  SEC. 2.  Section 43.2 is added to the Civil Code, to read:

profit any personal information concerning a person without that
