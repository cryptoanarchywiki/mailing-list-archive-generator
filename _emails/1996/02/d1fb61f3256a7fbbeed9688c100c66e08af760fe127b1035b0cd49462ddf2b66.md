Well I consider PGP to be "Good Enough" (C - quantum economics). And
with the new "enclyptor", encrypt/decrypt from Windoze is just
a clipboard away. Seems like there are two kinds of crypto/firewalls/???
these days: those that are like French cars with beautiful GUIs and a
4 cyl engine, and the American ones with great drivetrains and terrible
coachwork (why is purple so popular ?). And then there was the Facel-Vega 
HK-500...
						Warmly,
