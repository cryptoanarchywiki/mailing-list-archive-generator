A Frank Zappa icon would be highly appropriate for that - I don't know how
his record publishers would feel about someone scanning it off an album cover
and retouching for the web, but you could probably work out something.
A Zappa IMG button with HREF to a copy of his album language rating label 
would seem very fitting.

        Before Bill Clinton signed the Exon Internet Censorship Bill,
                Tipper Gore brought you Music Censorship.
