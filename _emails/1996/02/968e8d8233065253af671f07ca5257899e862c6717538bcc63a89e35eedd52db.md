Hello Andrew, I recommend that you set your line widths so a
smaller number so that people who quote you, as above, don't
generate >80 col lines, as above.


But anyway, I drew my own PGP logo for my "Bryce's Auto-PGP"
distribution site.  The logo's a kloogey piece of work, but 
I like the motif of an envelope with "PGP" stamped across 
the seal, so I use it.  If anyone else does the same idea
better, I'd love to see (/copy) it.


Anyone is welcome to copy my "PGP- the electronic envelope"
logo, but by doing so you are assenting to this contract,
which states that the next time we are hanging out together
in the same bar you will buy me a beer.
