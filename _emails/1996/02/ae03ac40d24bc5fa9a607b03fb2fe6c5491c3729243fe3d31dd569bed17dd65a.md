I do not recall that I said that we would retain you - The question was 
asked about unbiased judges - we simply stated that we would agree to 
you, Derek, and Immcarth as Judges - As I recall, it was Derek who asked 
for the Algorithms employed for investigation by the Cypherpunks, as he 
referred to them as a loose knit organization - but if you prefer, we 
will call them a mailing list - running fakers like us out of business 
should be its own reward 

Please do as you choose - you too  seem to be skating - please put up or 
shutup - I do not mean to be rude, and apolgise, but everytime we agree 
to something, everyone wants more - 

Appreciatively, 
Ralph
