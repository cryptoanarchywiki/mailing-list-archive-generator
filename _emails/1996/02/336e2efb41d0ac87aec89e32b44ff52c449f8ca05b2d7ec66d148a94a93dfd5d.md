I've added a couple of features to BAP (mainly being able to
quote an encrypted message that you are replying to, and a 
command-line interface for script-writers.) and called it 
v1.1 and I'm distributing the 1.1beta at <a href=
"http://www.c2.org/~bryce/Niche.html"> the Niche </a> for 
20 cents payable in Mark Twain Bank Ecash.  If you are too
technologically backwards or miserly to pay 20 cents for
this then you can probably convince me to e-mail a copy.


BAP is "Bryce's Easy PGP"-- my own PGP<->Unix programs 
integrator script.  When I set out to write it, my goal was 
to make it easy enough to use that my mother could do so.  
She does now, so I consider it a success!  Here is what some
other people have said about BAP:


   "Great job!  Much better than the hacked sendproc 
    I used to use with MH!"
           - Philip R. Moyer <prm@rome.isl.sri.com>

   "I've tried competing products and found this to be the 
    cleanest, smoothest and easiest to install.  I have no 
    personal, commercial or financial interest in this 
    product.  It does 'auto-pgp' for pine, elm and tin."
           - Henry W. Farkas <hfarkas@ims.advantis.com>

   "So far, I've been absolutely _thrilled_ with BAP and how
    easily it integrates with both elm and trn.  As you can 
    see, I actually have it running on almost everything 
    I post or email from this site."
           - Alexander Williams <thantos@runic.mind.org>

   "I have just 'bought' copies of your bap_in and bap_out
    software, and I'm just letting you know so that you can 
    add me to your user list.
      You may be interested to know that this is the first 
    thing that I've found worthwhile 'buying' using 
    [cyberbuck trial] ecash since I joined the digicash 
    ecash scheme just after it started.  I've been wanting 
    to incorporate pgp into email (I use elm) for a while 
    now, and your software has enabled me to do so easily.  
    Good on you, keep up the good work."
           - Glen Pringle <pringle@cs.monash.edu.au>



I'm not going to be available to work on BAP for a little
while so all the glaring security holes, uglies, crashing
errors and so forth that come with 1.1b1 are just going to
stay there for a week or two unless someone else fixes them.


People who give me complaints, bug reports and feature 
suggestions have the privilege of being added to the
<a href="http://www.c2.org/~bryce/BAPThanks.html">
"Hall of BAP Contributors" </a>.  <BLINK> tag available upon
request.


Oh yeah-- and I've marked down the price of "BAP classic"
(v1.0whatever) to US$0.50 for each piece.  Come and get 'em!

:-)
