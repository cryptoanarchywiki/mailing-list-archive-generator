I don't think that it matters whether you convert to electronics or amplify
with laser techniques.  The cryptographic secret is kept in the quantum
uncertainity of the state of the (single) photon.  Anything that collapses
that quantum uncertainity acts as a man-in-the-middle and stops the key/OTP
generation.
