That's a misleading statement:  You said, "simply because..."    As should 
be abundantly clear from my other arguments, I wouldn't wish to see anyone 
killed "simply because"  of the fact I "don't agree with them."  It is their 
ACTIONS that I feel violate my rights; that is what  justifies my seeking 
their deaths, should I choose to do so.

That's about the weakest argument I've heard in a long time.  I'm amazed 
that you weren't too embarrassed to post it to the list.  While I don't know 
precisely what your definition of the phrase "government employee" really 
is, I "every citizen" is a "governement employee" then you must have a 
REALLY weird definition of that.

Somehow, I think that this is where  your argument fails, and it fails 
miserably.

Sorry, I disagree.  Now, I am certainly aware of the classic "Gandhi-type" 
total non-violence principle, but it turns out that very few people actually 
believe in that.  Most people seem to think that they are entitled to 
protect themselves from violations of rights.  The fact that these 
violations of rights may be done by "government employees" is at most 
irrelevant, in that this doesn't justify it.  Anybody who feels entitled to 
use violence against a burglar, rapist, or murderer is correct; attempting 
to deny me the right to protect my property from GOVERNMENT people is, in 
itself, a violation of my rights.

Are you a statist?
