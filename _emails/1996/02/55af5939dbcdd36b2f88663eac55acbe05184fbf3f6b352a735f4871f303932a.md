The ernstzundl@aol.com imposter obviously does not know that Xenu will
chain him to an Antarctic volcano and annihilate him with nuclear
weapons. Beware the thetans!

ObCrypto: Obviously someone as controversial as Zundel needs to PGP-sign
his messages. (Actually, *her* messages, since Ingrid posts for the
Zundelish One.) Does anyone want to show her how to use PGP? I think she
has a PPP connection from her computer at home to cts.com. Message
headers don't indicate what mailer she uses.
