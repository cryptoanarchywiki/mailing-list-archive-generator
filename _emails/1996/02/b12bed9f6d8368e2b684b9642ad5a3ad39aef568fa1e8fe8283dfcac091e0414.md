Given the massive number of "degrees of freedom" compared to earlier days
when the Iron Curtain "sort of" worked, albeit with lots of leaks, I see
little chance it can be pulled off.

The Chinese want a Bamboo Curtain, the Muslims want a Veiled Curtain, the
Jews want a Wailing Wall, and the Germans wanted barbed wire. It ain't
gonna work.

The usual suspects: SAIC, Wackenhut, NewsCorp, etc.

[This Bible excerpt awaiting review under the Communications Decency Act]
And then Lot said, "I have some mighty fine young virgin daughters. Why
don't you boys just come on in and do em right here in my house - I'll just
watch!"....Later, up in the mountains, the younger daughter said. "Dad's
getting old. I say we should do him." So the two daughters got him drunk and
did him all that night. Sure enough, Dad got em pregnant....Onan really
hated the idea of doing his brother's wife and getting her pregnant while
his brother got all the credit, so he whacked off first....Remember, it's
not a good idea to have sex with your sister, your brother, your parents,
your pet dog, or the farm animals. [excerpts from the Old Testament, Modern
Vernacular Translation, TCM, 1996]
