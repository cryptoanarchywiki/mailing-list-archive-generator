There's an easy test.. set up the real RC2 to encrypt data and have this 
one decrypt it, then reverse the two, use different keys, etc...  a few 
thousand rounds should give a strong indication if this is the true RC2.

It doesn't mean that it wasn't rigged to produce weak keys and such, 
however a closer analysis of the source will point that out. :)
