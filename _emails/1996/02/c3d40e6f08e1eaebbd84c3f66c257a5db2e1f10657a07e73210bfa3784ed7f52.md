They _haven't_ gained that knowledge, only the knowledge that it isn't
_totally_ broken and spewing zeros.  For example, the output of
       while(1) printf("%8c", des(i++, key));  // Pretend syntax is correct
would probably pass the randomness tests just fine, in spite of being entirely
predictable and having only 56 bits of key plus log(i) bits of state, 
and is  vulnerable to most cryptanalysis attacks on DES systems as well.
But it's not a One Time Pad, it's just counter-mode DES.
