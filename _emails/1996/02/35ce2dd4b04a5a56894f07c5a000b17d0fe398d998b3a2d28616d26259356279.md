This does not accurately represent what I said, and it certainly does not 
represent what I have done. You are still identified as "My friend 
Declan," and I recommend that people visit your site.

I actually would have appreciated it if you had crowed, or at least 
shared, your media contacts. For example, I only just now found out about 
Steve Pizzo's poorly researched article in Web Review, where he presents 
as my views deliberate lies that I told Zundel in order to get his 
cooperation and trust.

This does not accurately reflect your mail. At this time, you have not
removed my full name, either.

You will find that Haggai had been Cc'd on several messages back and forth
on fight-censorship, and he was Bcc'd on my original request (at the
header of my message to you was a notice that it was being Bcc'd to other
people at Stanford).  While I don't appreciate his mommying me, I hardly
consider his mail unsolicited or unwarranted, since you have still failed
to honor my request.

The "speech code" was never applied to anyone, and was widely regarded to 
be unenforceable. I opposed it. It was a joke, yes.

What were we talking about again?

Then you, kadie, and I agree. I have a point. Why do you persist in 
identifying, in two places, a Stanford University Mirror Site?

I strongly disagree.

Which has more symbolic power for good, a single man standing in front of
a tank in Tiananmen Square, or nuking Hiroshima and Nagasaki?

It is not ethical to abuse this power we have. Especially because neither 
of us are students at the universities whose machines we are abusing.

I do understand the way the media works. They live on "press releases" 
from "recognized authorities." Most

Since my mirror site has been limited to .edu and selected other domains 
for a full day, this is an odd question. 

The demonstrable harm, as you now agree, is that the Ottawa Times, 
http://intranet.on.ca/ott_time.html, the Stormfront-L neo-nazi list, and 
so on are full of lies about how universities sympathetic to Zundel's 
fight against Zionist oppression and the Holocaust Lie have jumped to his 
defense.

No distributors. Only point sources. And as has been pointed out, they 
often get off with a slap on the wrist.

You have been duped by Zundel's false claims of persecution. I bet you 
even bought the "Dr. Axl Clocstein" story for a while.

1. As I've been saying for the last day and a half, please remove all 
occurrences of the strings "Stanford" and "Graves." I hardly think that 
requesting not to be so identified is egotistical.

2. While you're at it, it would be good to remove the following as well, 
which does not accurately reflect the facts.

 In early January, Zundel contacted the Simon Wiesenthal Center and asked
 permission to reproduce some of their materials. He wanted to disprove
 some of their views as he had tried to rebut those of the Nizkor Project.
 (The Nizkor folks earlier had requested bidirectional linking. Zundel
 agreed to their request, heralding the experiment as "The Great Internet
 Holocaust Debate.")

Nizkor's response to this is rather prominent on their Web site.

3. Please fix this:
 
 January 29, 1996: This site goes online, with the help of files supplied
 by Rich (rich@c2.org), supplemented with more recent documents taken
 directly from the Zundelsite. Rich's site at Stanford University goes
 online. (Note that Rich and I mirrored the Zundelsite at our own
 initiative, not by request.)

To bolster Zundel's coyright claim against the National Alliance, please
clarify that "we" specifically requested the materials from Zundel, and
that his handler Marc uploaded them all to "one of our machines" (since we
could not have run a WebWacker on the highly overloaded webcom.com). Also 
remove the string "Stanford." In any case, the files are no longer 
available at Stanford.

4. February 1, 1996: Web Review Magazine reports on the mirror sites.

I have sent mail to Steve Pizzo and requested that he call me to correct 
some false statements attributed to me.

5. February 1, 1996, afternoon: UMass censors mirror. Simon Wiesenthal
   Center sends letters of protest to participating mirror universities.
   Sameer announces University of California at Berkeley mirror. 

Every one of these is false.

a. The operator of the UMass mirror objects to your characterization of 
   what happened as "censorship," and to your posting his private mail.

b. Where is your confirmation of Simon Wiesenthal's action?

c. Sameer has not announced a UC Berkeley mirror. He specifically asked 
   that it not be listed because like most of us, he is beginning to have
   ethical qualms. 

6. On index.html you have:

 There is an apparent campaign of email and web bombing being launched
 againt Zundel's site on Webcom, making it near-impossible to reach. 

Do you have a source for this besides me? Well, I retract the rumor. In
fact it seems that the problem is that Zundel foolishly put a bunch of
huge RealAudio files on his page that are overloading the server.

I guess this is supposed to be something clever about how the vanguard is
supposed to discard their personal interests for the common good. 

I am a member of no vanguard.
