Commtouch has decided to offer a controlled release of Pronto Secure to the 
Cypherpunk community. We believe that scrutiny of the product by members of 
this list will help us to release a safe and secure E-mail client.

Pronto Secure is an Internet E-Mail client for Windows, which uses external 
security providers to enhance e-mail with cryptographic security features. 
The current beta version relies on the proven security facilities of PGP to 
provide encryption, authentication, integrity and key management features.
Future versions will include S/Mime and MOSS compliance.

Product requirements: 
- - MS-Windows 3.1 / Windows for Workgroups 3.11 / Windows 95 / Windows NT
- - Winsock 3.11 compliant environment (TCP/IP stack)
- - Installed version of PGP.

We plan to make Pronto Secure available via FTP at the end of this week. 
Parties interested in joining the beta-test program are invited to send me 
pgp-signed e-mail requesting down load instructions and our public key for 
authenticating the version. Beta-testers who provide us with feedback will 
be eligible to receive a free final release version. Sorry no T-shirts, but 
we guarantee that you'll get more wear out of Pronto Secure :).
