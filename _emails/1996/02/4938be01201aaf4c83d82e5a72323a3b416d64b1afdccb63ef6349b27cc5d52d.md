While people in the Bay Area were taking part in Naked Jello Wrestling
and other dubious pursuits, the best 'n the brightest of Minnesota 
were pestering the waitstaff at an Applebee's franchise overlooking
frozen Lake Calhoun in Minneapolis, where yet another good time
(though maybe not as spicy a time) was had by all. If you want to
know more, you'll have to ask: we didn't have a hot tub, so none
of us expect a book deal anytime soon.
