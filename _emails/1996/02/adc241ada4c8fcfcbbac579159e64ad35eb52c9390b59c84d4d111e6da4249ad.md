There are remarkable similarities between this 'system' and the Elementrix
one.  Could it be that E-ix is selling some licenses to the unsuspecting?
Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Both involve:

- An ill-defined cure-all solution which can't realy be revealed because of
patent-pending status

- An OTP (so they say) that's not really an OTP

- Starting with a 'seed' that is truly random and then algorithmically
generating a stream that is XOR-ed with the data, based on analogies to
"rotors" and "dice"

- Encrypting keystream data using portions of the previous keystream

** fairly remarkable coincidences.  Or is it that great minds think alike?
