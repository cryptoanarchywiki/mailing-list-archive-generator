Not like I have the time or anything, but is there any value in
attempting something like "bruterc2"?

(IANARC (I am not a real cryptographer), but it looks like one trick
to that would be to somehow short-circuit the key setup stage.  I
suppose you could just start after it's mapped the user key into the
"xkey" array, but I might be missing something.)
