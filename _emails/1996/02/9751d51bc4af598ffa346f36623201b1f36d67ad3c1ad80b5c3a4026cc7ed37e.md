Some of Friedman's instruction manuals from the (pre?)WW2 days have been
declassified.  When I was down at Computer Literacy Bookshops
(408/435-1118) in San Jose, they had 5 or 6 titles on codebreaking. 
Applied Cryptography talks about some more modern attacks, such as meet in
the middle.  Starting from the references and going to a good technical
library might produce some information.

Good Luck - Bill
