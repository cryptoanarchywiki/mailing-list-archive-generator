In that case, I expect it will be fascinating to see what happens to *.hk
when it gets swallowed by China. Presumably the Chinese govt. will at least
try to enforce the regulations (registration etc.) it has announced so far.

What is the Hong Kong part of the net doing in anticipation of the 
transition ?  Depending upon what happens in the next couple of years, it
seems to me that *.hk could be an impressive Trojan horse for the mainland
authorities to handle. I suggest that anyone who wants to deploy crypto tools
behind the Great Firewall should seriously consider outfitting the Hong Kong
populace with them.
