Perry sent me a polite note asking why I had posted the original post, and

He suggested that in the future I make it clear why I think my posts are
relevent to the subject of the list.

I agree that keeping the cost of market entry low, by having the technical
standards freely available at no cost is an excellent way of furthering
this goal.  (The IETF has a similar policy.)  In addition, free software
(in the sense of the Free Software Foundation) will help.

BTW - I do not consider oligopolistic control of the net of the net to be a
serious danger in the five year time frame.  I am less sanguine about the
30 year time frame.
