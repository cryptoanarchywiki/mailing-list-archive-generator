Somebody please hand the guy a textbook on information theory. The entropy
of your "larger OTP" *can not* be greater than the entropy of your original
OTP. You are suspending Golden Gate Bridge by a string. Anybody using it

Side note: why do these snake oil salesmen tend to have such horrible
spelling? Let me guess. Because they design their software with the same
care they use to compose their posts?
