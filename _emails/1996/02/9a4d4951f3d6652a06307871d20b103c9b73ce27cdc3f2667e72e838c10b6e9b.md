I have responded privately to Jordan Hayes on this issue. Reasonable people
can disagree on historical events, and historical motives, and certainly
the "decision to drop the bomb" has long been a contentious one.

I regret that Jordan Hayes believes a condescending tone, implying others
are not as scholarly as he, is the way to make a point.

(I've also received several long articles from people who seemed outraged
that I was belittling the dropping of the bomb. I wasn't belittling it. Far
from it. The Japs surrendered after the second bomb, so it was obviously
not a trivial matter to them.)
