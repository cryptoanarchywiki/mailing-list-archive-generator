	Since the only cryptographic relevance here is whether the US knew
about Japan's current state, and that isn't actually relevant, I won't
respond to the list further on this. I regard the dropping of the bomb as
right because it saved American lives, no matter who you believe on how many.
America was on the side of good in WWII, and the Japanese (as much as they
fail to admit it publically, including to their schoolchildren) were on the
evil one. This is the case for several reasons:
	First, the Japanese had allied themselves with the Nazis.
	Second, the Japanese had done definite wrongs in China and elsewhere.
	Third, the Japanese attacked the US first (and it doesn't matter
whether the US knew about it beforehand).

	It also doesn't matter whether Truman et al were considering the
effects on the Soviet Union. To use a current example, just because an ISP
is paid doesn't mean that that ISP is wrong to keep on Neo-Nazi material. 
	If you wish to continue this discussion; feel free to do so via private
email.
	-Allen
