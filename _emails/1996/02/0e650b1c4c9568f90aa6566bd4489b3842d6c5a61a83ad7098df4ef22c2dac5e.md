They may have integrity; they just adhere to different moral principles.
E.g., if their salaries are paid by the advertisers, they may feel that
they owe their allegiance to the advertisers, not the readers, and that
pleasing the advertisers is more important than telling the (whole) truth.

I can determine what's not worth reading for me. (I wish I had better technical
means to filter out the incoming traffic that I know is not worth my reading --
freedom of non-association, in addition to freedom of speech and freedom of
association :-). I could share my opinions with others (through a rating system
or by publicly urging everyone to *plonk* someone I don't like, although I find
this in bad taste). I can't determine that an item is so unworthy that it
should be suppressed and that someone else should be deprived of his right
to read it. In my opinion, I can't determine that a certain item of information
is not worth being published/transmitted at all. Someone else is likely to
be interested in the information that I'm not interested in.

Frankly, I've never looked at the stuff the WC is trying to suppress. I know
enough on the subject to be convinced that it's not worth my time and effort.
But if someone wants to publish it, and someone else wishes to read what they
publish, they should be at liberty to do that. I don't think they're the same
as the WC's, who seek to suppress speech.

As for pciking a more popular cause for a test case, yes, I wish there was
something more savory (like PRC or SG dissidents), but "popular speech doesn't
need protection".
