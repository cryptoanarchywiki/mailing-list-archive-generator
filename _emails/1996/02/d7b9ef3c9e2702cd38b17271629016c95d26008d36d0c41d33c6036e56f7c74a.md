Sophomoric idiocy.  I can think of few actions that would marginalize
the on-line community more than for a bunch of geeks to mailbomb the
"white house".  Some poor sysadmin will be stuck dealing with his
filled-up mailbox, and that's it.  Is anybody so seriously delusional
that they imagine poor Bill Clinton having to work his way through all
the mail with elm?

Sheesh.
