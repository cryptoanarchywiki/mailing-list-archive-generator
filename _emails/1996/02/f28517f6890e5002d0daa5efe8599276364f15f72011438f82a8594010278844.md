Thank you for such a well-written defense of my philosophy.

Clearly, the government is now out of effective control of the citizenry; it

I describe, while it may appear to some to be extreme, is a sincere attempt 
to return control to the populace.

Yes, please.  Frankly, Allen, it's a pleasure to see people really 
UNDERSTAND what I'm talking about!  You obviously do, better than mos
t.
