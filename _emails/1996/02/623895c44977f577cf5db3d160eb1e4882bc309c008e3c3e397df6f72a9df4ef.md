McMickle also drafted the Grassley bill which would turn ftp of PGP into
a RICO-enforceable federal crime.  That's the bill the FBI declared was
laughably extreme.  It sank into nothingness -- but I did have a few
rounds with McMickle on the phone about it.  He appeared to take special
pleasure in the idea of putting PRZ in jail and siezing all his worldly
goods for the crime of nose-thumbing at the USGov't.
