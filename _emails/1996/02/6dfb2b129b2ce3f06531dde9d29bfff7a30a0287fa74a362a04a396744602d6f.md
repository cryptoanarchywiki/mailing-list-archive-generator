Know your enemies:

There's an op-ed in LI Newsday by Cathleen A. Cleaver ("directory of 
legal studies at the Family Research Council..." in LI Newsday today.

Serious pro-CDA spin here. Justifies the bust of Amateur Action BBS, 
ignoring that they were set up by the gov't, and then insists the CDA 
only prohibits making porn accessible to kids. Calls anti-CDA folx 
"free-speech zealots" and "friends of the porn industry", claims the 
courts can determine merit on a per-case basis, and claims objections 
to CDA are really from "arrogance and greed... Most Americans do not 
have access to the Internet. The on-line elite would like to keep it 
that way..."
