There are a number of process viewing applications available for Win95/NT.
I use two of them: one is called pstat.exe and the other is ps.exe.  Both of
them
show most of the visible processes running.  ps does not show running services,
but pstat does.  Both of them are available at

ftp://csa.gt.ed.net
