I have created several FAQ'S that I hope will streamline the
creation and subsequent sending of postings or email using
Private Idaho. I would like any feedback, pro or con on the
usefulness of these documents. My goal throughout the writing
process was to make it as EASY as possible to set up an account
on alpha.c2.org. As most people know, subsequent to setting up
your account on the alpha server, one can post anonymously to
newsgroups and send anonymous email.

This by NO MEANS is the ONLY way to send anonymous mail, but is
a popular way of doing so. I was prompted to write these FAQ's
because of the amount of frustration that I experienced while
trying to setup my anonymous account. Hopefully others will have
an easier path, subsequent to reading my FAQ's. I have sent a
copy of these FAQ's to the author of Private Idaho and hope to
be hearing from him soon about any
glaring omissions or errors. Should you find any errors, please
point them out. It is most important that easy to use, step by
step documents be made available for the public. The consequence
of enabling individuals to easily set up an anonymous presence,
is the free flow of information and to be able to challenge a
"fact" or individual without hesitation or possible
repercussions. I hope my FAQ's will help in this regard.

The FAQ's can be found at:

While you're there, check out some of the other spots that have
caught my attention. Hope you enjoy, and don't forget to give
me
your feedback, pro or con.
