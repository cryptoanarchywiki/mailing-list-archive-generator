Dude, while these subject lines are very quaint, given the level of
traffic, I would really appreciate more descriptive subject headings. You
may use any official UN language that can be written in 8-bit characters.

Prevent? How about "Band-Aid?"

Recall that in many cases, Band-Aids actually promote infection by 
providing a dark, humid place for growth.

What's the matter? Their mothers didn't like them or something? Just try
