Here's another idea (don't laugh): to set up a system where mailing
lists and newsgroups have public keys that you can encrypt directly to.
Advantage for anonymous mail is that if a remailer is untrustowrthy,
there's still some security in the final remailing of the document.

Furthermore, non-encrypted mail is less at risk of tampering. And some
newsgroups or lists could requires a signed message from an approved
key before posting.
