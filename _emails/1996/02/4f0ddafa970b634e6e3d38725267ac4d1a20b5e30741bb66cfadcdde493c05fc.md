Subject: New discussion group "CDA96-L" = COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT of 1996 

     In light of the recent furor over the airwaves, in the media, and in 
lawsuits regarding the COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT of 1996 that United 
States' President Clinton signed into law on February 8, 1996, I 
have created a forum for people to discuss the concerns raised by this 
(and similar) pieces of legislation.

LISTNAME:      CDA96-L
FULL TITLE:    Communications Decency Act of 1996 Discussion Group
FORMAT:        Un-moderated, Postings must come from registered subscribers
SUBSCRIPTIONS: via LISTPROC software
LISTOWNER:     Gary M. Klein <gklein@willamette.edu>

DESCRIPTION:   
     CDA96-L is open to the networkng community.  Its primary role is
to serve as a means of communication among people who are concerned
about the implications of the United States of America's COMMUNICATIONS
DECENCY ACT of 1996 (signed into law by President William J. Clinton
on February 8, 1996).  Its secondary role is to serve as a discussion
forum for similar legislation or regulation that may be in the formative
or final stages in any other country, or at any local jurisdiction that
would restrict, limit or inhibit use of Internet resources based on
"decency", "morality", "offensiveness", or based on the age of someone
using, operating, or accessing an Internet resource.
