I don't believe that this follows at all. All that would be required 
would be a statutory obligation to comply with the legislation. Should a 
breach occur, civil and criminal penalties would apply. No need for prior 
restraint.

It would not make it harder for buyers and sellers to get together, it 
would simply increase the risk. It may lead to higher prices, but I am 
prepared to pay something to protect my privacy.

It would be very hard to prevent the government keeping files on you. 
They have requirements such as tax collection etc that would require 
keeping files. What I would like to see is similar protection of my data 
that is stored on goverment computers. Should my information be released, 
the agency responsible should have to pay compensation. Such is the price 
of not keeping my information secret.

I agree that in the absolute sense, this is true. However, it is not 
practical to do so in our modern society. If you are prepared to live 
without credit or health insurance you can do this but the price is too 
high for most people to consider.
