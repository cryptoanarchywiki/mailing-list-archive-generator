I recently picked up "PGP Windows Shell".  I have found it to be an excellent utility for encrypting and decrypting messages as easily as cutting to and pasting from the clipboard.  All operations are automated, you can use whatever mailer you want, and it's freeware.  The URL is http://iquest.com/~aegisrc/utils2.shtml 

Also, if you want something to automate usage of the cypherpunk style remailers, check out Joel McNamara's Private Idaho.  It's an excellent tool, also freeware, and is available at URL http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm/pi.html

Another utility you might like to look at (of course it's freeware too) is PGP WinFront.  While it's a little more cumbersome than PGP Windows Shell, it has all the same functionality.  There is also a shareware utility available from the same URL, called PGP QuickFront.  The combination of QuickFront and WinFront make using PGP under windows almost pleasant.  It can be found at http://netaccess.on.ca/ugali/crypt/ .
