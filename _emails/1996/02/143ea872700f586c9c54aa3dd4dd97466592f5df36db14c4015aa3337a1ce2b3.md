Nice try - but the virtual machine model used by intel supports interception
of I/O operations.  Now one could get into timing how long the I/O takes to
detect interception by the memory manager but it would be a royal pain since
the keyboard I/O controller latency is rather machine specific.

I still think the basic 'if the machine is not secure all bets are off'
premis stands.
