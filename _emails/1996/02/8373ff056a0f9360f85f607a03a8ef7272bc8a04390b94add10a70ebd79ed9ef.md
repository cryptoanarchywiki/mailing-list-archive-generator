I have just read your conditions for releasing the information tha the 
group felt was necessary to evaluate your product. A couple of comments.
First, the Cypherpunks are not an organized group who can agree to your 
conditions. This is simply a mailing list not a corporate entity to be 
contracted with. To attempt to treat them as such and to use their 
resources for your marketing gain is, in my opinion, less than honest. If 
the code has not been broken in 5 months, nothing will have been proved. 
A better model to follow would be that used (eventually) by Netscape. 
Release the code for comment and make changes based on weaknesses 
discovered by the group.
	My last point has to do with one of your restrictions. Why will 
you not release the information to Canadians? It cannot be ITAR, because 
it does not apply to Canadians. How can you claim that the Cypherpunks 
failed to break your system if you exclude its most brilliant members! <G>.

Regards from Canada,
