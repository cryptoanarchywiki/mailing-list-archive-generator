DAY 10: DR. BLACK located a promising entry point at the target site. DR.
BLACK recovered four of the six password tokens before his position was
compromised. DR. BLACK will be replaced by DR. ORANGE.

Estimated time to recover the remaining two password tokens and gain access
to target: EIGHT DAYS (03.01.96)

Confidence is HIGH.

My team has been working around the clock for a month now. Please tell your
people to be more tolerant. Yelling doesn't help anything.
