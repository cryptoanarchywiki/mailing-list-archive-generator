	Right. it's a tough call though. Suppose the list didn't go
into paroxysms and someone lost big by using snake oil. Then our
friends at FV will say "oh look at this crypto which lost people
money". -- and we did nothing to prevent that opportunity.
	I'm not saying that paroxysms are -good-, just that one should
be wary of the consequences of what may happen if someone loses big to
snake oil.
