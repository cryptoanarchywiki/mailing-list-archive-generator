Let's not celebrate just yet.  While it is a great improvement, it still causes errors if you try to encrypt an attached file and conventional encryption still doesn't work here.  The only one that is working all around for me is Private Idaho.  We are moving in right direction though.

Can I just add a loud HURRAH! on the integration of PGP and Pegasus 
using the PGPJN add-on. 

It is by far the smoothest melding of PGP and a e-mail routine to 
date. The only way it would be smoother is on one program. THe 
learning curve is also negligible. 

For all those griping about no good PGP windoze e-mail programs, your 
wait is over. This mail program won over a die hard Eudora fan in 
about 15 minutes... Someone else already posted the sites to get this 
so forgive my laziness of not repeating their words.

Oh, did I mention this is seamless under Windoze 95 as well?
