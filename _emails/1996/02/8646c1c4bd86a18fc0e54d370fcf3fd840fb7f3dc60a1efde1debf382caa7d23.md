   2-10-96. EcoMist:

   "We know you're reading this." A survey of US privacy
   issues, with GAK, crypto and anonymity options. 

      Americans think they have a right to privacy but they 
      have lost control over who knows what about them. The 
      chief culprits are lots of little brothers, all 
      gossiping with each other over computer networks. But 
      Big Brother is doing his bit: in the struggle against 
      crime, terrorism, deadbeat parents, illegal immigrants 
      and even traffic jams, the government keeps an 
      ever-closer eye on its citizens. Technology itself 
      may provide a partial answer. All-but-foolproof 
      encryption technology is freely available over the 
      Internet and will not go away no matter how much 
      Uncle Sam wishes it would. 

   "Virtual privacy." A related editorial which examines
   privacy protection regulation.

   "Magic armour."

      The Shortstop system deploys coherent jamming to fool
      a proximity fuse into thinking that its shell has
      arrived at detonation height when it is actually at an 
      altitude of 100 metres or so. To do this, Shortstop 
      uses a special "durfum" chip.

   DUR_fum  (For the 3)
