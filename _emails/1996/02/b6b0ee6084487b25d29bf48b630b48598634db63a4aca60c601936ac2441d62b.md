Find out if yours ( or any ) representative or senator voted for the 
CDA.  Send me email with the subject CDA-YES.  Put their name and 
where they are from in the body. I'll compile the list and post it.
When this is over they'll wish they realized how powerful the 
internet REALLY is.

Besides, what makes the US Congress think they have any control over 
a worldwide network?

PS. Repost this msg where appropriate.  I'm only posting to 
cypherpunks.
Another "Logical Conclusion" by:
Tim Cook <twcook@cts.com>
Support THE US Constitution...
Vote Alexander in '96 and '00!
