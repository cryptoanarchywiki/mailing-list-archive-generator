I've just finished my monthly round of type I remailer testing. This test
doesn't include remailers announced after I started; they'll be inclued next
month. (Also coming in March will be tests of at least one other nym server.)


As in January, I sent posts from my PPP account here (at Aracnet, this time,
rather than Teleport) through a given remailer to an account at alpha.c2.org,
then back through the remailer to me. This is, by design, a very different
sort of test than remailer pinging and the like; in the number of hops and
chances for things to go wrong, I think it reflects actual usage much more
closely.

Trip time is the interval from being posted to mail.aracnet.com to arriving
in my mailbox there. All times are given in hours:minutes. Posts were made at
all times of day. Unsurprisingly, those made late at night (particularly in
the midnight-to-6 am range) returned most quickly.

I've included the January figures for comparison persons. I remain curious
about the differences and eager to find an explanation.

I'd particularly like to thank the remailer operations who (mostly in private
mail) answered a number of questions of mine.
