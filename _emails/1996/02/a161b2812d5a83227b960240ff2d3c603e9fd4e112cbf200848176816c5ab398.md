Nuke *Fulham*? I thought you might have picked up a few tidbits from the
last nukepunks thread, but just in case- despite what you may have heard,
nuclear weapons are not precision tools. A device dropped on Fulham would
probably not be welcomed by Her Majesty's Government, although since the
blast damage would probably level Kensington Palace to the ground, it
would solve the Diana problem.
