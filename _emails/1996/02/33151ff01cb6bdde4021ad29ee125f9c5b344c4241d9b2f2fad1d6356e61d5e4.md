not as much, IMHO, as you would seem to suggest.  50% mirrors picking off
those laser beams would do it, and you could not detect the resulting
attenuation as distinct from naturally ocurring attenuation and variation.

KNOWN opposition ... hmmm.  you're back to obscurity=security.
It's always expensive to eavesdrop (tapped any fiber cables in pressure
jackets recently?) ... and (having been in the same business as yourself
once) alignment and bandwidth problems of them pesky little scanners is a
pretty hefty problem.

The concept seems to have merit ... but I don't think I'd want to have to
implement it!
Easily adapted .... ?????
