If you reject that possibility, you imply that the result of your work 
for yourself might not be your own property.  It does not matter if the
idea patented was originated be the patent holder of was purchased by the
patent holder.  Money is equivalent to personnal work.

And the property rights *are* fundamentals (even if not implemented in 
Biiieauuuutifull Canada...).

You can not have your cake and eat it too...

AFAIK, such clause already exists in Canada.  But again, I am not a layer.
