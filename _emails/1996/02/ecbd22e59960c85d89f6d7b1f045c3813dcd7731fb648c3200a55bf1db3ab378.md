Just as many people program their televisions using VCR-Plus codes to
record the shows they want (using TV Guide as a rating service)
it would be easy for any rating service to publish a list of the
codes for Approved Shows, Banned Shows, Rated-by-interestingness shows, etc.
without putting any government-mandated rating chip in the TVs
or forcing the TV producers to rate them (which also has a chilling
effect on the shows produced.)
