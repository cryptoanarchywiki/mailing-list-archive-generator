	I'm a libertarian, and I mailed TCMay about that post - in private
email. I preferred not to clutter up the list, and am only doing so now in
case of political newbies otherwise believing you. I would point out that
Islam is currently noticeable for wrongdoing _when in control of a government_;
the same tends to be true of any religion, including my own of Christianity.
An example of such wrongdoing is the restriction of women in countries such as
Saudi Arabia (and, of course, Iran). Have you seen any libertarians advocating
banning the chador in the United States?

	Unfortunately, neither of these would take that much. A university with
competent physics, engineering, and chemistry departments could do the first;
smuggling could do the second.
