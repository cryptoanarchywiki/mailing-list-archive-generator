Speaker-independent recognition of digits is a done deal.
For large-scale automated attacks, you obviously don't wiretap the customer;
you hire The Dread Pirate Mitnick* to wiretap the 800 number for the
Home Shopping Channel, and hoover down the CC numbers of a large
number of known frequent-shopping cardholders.  (Actually, hitting on them
might be a bit tough, since they've presumably got direct T1s or T3s from
one or more carriers, which are harder to tap than the average residence line.)


(*Not the original Kevin "Dread Pirate" Mitnick, who's retired,
but Fred Bargle, who's got the current Dread Pirate Mitnick franchise.... :-)
