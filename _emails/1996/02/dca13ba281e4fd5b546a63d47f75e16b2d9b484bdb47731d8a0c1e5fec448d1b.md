Given that the world of telephony is moving towards Local Number Portability,
isn't it inevitable that the internet will be expected to provide the
equivalent functionality?  In the world of telephones it's being mandated
in the name of local loop competition, which presumably isn't a problem
for the internet.  But if someday i can move across the country and
keep my telephone number, i'd expect the same of my internet address.

That said, the issue of who manages the database is a significant one, but
more political/economic issue than technical.
