Libertarians do not believe in killing civilians with nukes.  Libertarians
do not believe in murder, period.  We're not the ones calling for the
death penalty for drug lords.  We're not the ones calling for military
force in foreign countries, be they Kuwait or Bosnia.  Infact, the
Libertarian Party has often called for nuclear disarmament. 

Libertarians are interested in democratic change, not violent 
revolution.  

ObCrypto:  

William Winter, Director of Communications of the Libertarian Party, not
only ordered the Libertarian Party web site to go dark for "Black
Thursday," he also delivered an empassioned speech at the anti-CDA rally
in Washington, D.C., last saturday.

(http://www.wam.umd.edu/~tedwards/rally.html for pictures and links to
audio)

The Libertarian Party has consistantly sent out the strongest statements 
of any political party in support of cryptographic freedom and freedom of 
expression on the Internet.
