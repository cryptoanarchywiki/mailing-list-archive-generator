-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

When the RC4 implimentation for the HP48 was posted, someone else mentioned
the existence of a DES implimentation for the same machine. I remember
seeing this mentioned on the list earlier as well, but...

I've done searches with Archie, Alta Vista and Yahoo, as well as looking
through the excellent hks.net archives, but I haven't been able to find it.

Can someone point me in the right direction?

(Since I'm probably just too stupid to construct a proper Yahoo search, and
to keep list noise down, I'll sumarize privately e-mailed responses.)
