You need to cut back on your medication (or increase it).  The water damage
in oregon has little to do with the action or inaction of government.  It
has much more to do with a strange set of weather patterns in Oregon.
(Mainly a whole lot of snow and ice followed by heavy rains.)

Right now the weather here is just creating lots of land slides and
flooding.  The worst seems over for now.  Time to wait for the water to
recede and then clean up the mess.  How this can be blamed on the Oregon
State government is beyond me...

What it has do do with Cypherpunks, I have no idea...  (Not even much of a
conspiracy there.)

Sounds like someone just wnats to rant.
