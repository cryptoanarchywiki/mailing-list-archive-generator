	I'm an almost complete novice at cryptography, and even I know that
Perry is completely correct in this. Look at it this way. You've got a computer
algorithm doing something or another. Given the two pieces of information
(the entropy) of the initial somewhat random number and the number of
iterations, it will produce _one_ and _only one_ number out the end. Now, if
you have a high-quality PRNG (that's what this is), it will be very hard to
predict what set of numbers will turn out just from knowing the algorithm, but
you're still not adding to the number of possibilities from your initial
random number.

	Quite. It's about like my doing an experiment with randomly selected
groups and deliberately selecting only ones that match my preconcieved notions
of how it's supposed to be. You can do that for things that aren't what one is
looking at (i.e., controlling for stuff), but do it with the _result_ and
you'll be laughed out of any respectable journal in which you try to publish
it.
