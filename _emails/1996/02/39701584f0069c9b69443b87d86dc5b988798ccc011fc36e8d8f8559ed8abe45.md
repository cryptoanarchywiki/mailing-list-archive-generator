Building big brothers
book reviewed by Parveez Syed (c) Shanti RTV

   Building in Big Brother:
   The Cryptographic Policy Debate
   Edited by Lance J. Hoffman
   Springer Verlag Publishers
   Copyright: March 1995
   Price:$29.95
   ISBN 0-387-94441-9
   
"If you ever wondered how a particular computer technology could
attract the interest of the directors of three intelligence
agencies, the heavyweights in the computer industry, a gang of
programmers turned freedom fighters, and the President of the
United States, you need look no farther than Building in Big
Brother. This book outlines the next civil liberties battle in
the United States," according to Marc Rotenberg of Electronic
Privacy Information Center.
   
"One-stop-shopping for even the most sophisticated analyst of the
policy wars over cryptography," according to Michael Froomkin,
Associate Professor of Law, University of Miami Law School

"Lance Hoffman has compiled an extraordinarily useful and well
balanced collection of materials on cryptography and its 
applications. This book will instantly become a definitive 
compendium," Peter Neumann said.
   
"Though Lance Hoffman is a dedicated opponent of current 
government policy, he has assembled a volume that should be -- 
and will be -- on the desk of every cryptographic policymaker 
in Washington. He has accurately recorded the many voices in a 
debate that will profoundly affect our future, for good or ill, 
well into the twenty-first century. This book is an important 
contribution to the history of encryption. It is an even more 
important contribution to those who are struggling to shape 
that history," Stewart Baker, Steptoe & Johnson (formerly General
Counsel to the National Security Agency) added.

"An authoritative source of political writings by the major 
players in the crypto revolution," according to Philip
Zimmermann, Creator of PGP.

Food for thought?: "In politics, as in the snake oil business, it 
pays to have a short memory and a chameleon-like quality. That is 
why the relationship between a journalist and a politician should 
be like the one between a dog and a lamp-post".
But who is doing what to whom? One wonders ;-)
