Now, hold on here.  I was at the meeting and I don't know what you are 
referring to as "highly unethical behavior", could you expand this 
for myself and others.

As for "FOR:  I've received commentary which suggests that they believe that
key-signing somehow vouches for the HONESTY of the person involved; not his
IDENTITY."  Unless I'm in the minority, the key-signing process IS NOT a test 
to determine if the person is a 'honest' person, but to ensure that the keys 
where valid and that someone did not make a mistake somewhere.

Keep in mind that the meeting was a mixer, not a board of directors meeting - 
take a chill pill.
