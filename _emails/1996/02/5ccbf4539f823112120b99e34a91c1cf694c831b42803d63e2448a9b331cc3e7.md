        True enough.  Of course, those are the folks who take the weight
when credit card sales go sour... or the system is victimized by widespread
automated fraud.

        Actually, the most striking thing about the Garfinkel articles was
the degree to which he made the First Virtual marketing/propaganda Campaign
against consumer-PC-based credit card encryptors _the focus_ of the Mercury
News articles.

        FV's attack-code demo was overtly presented as a propaganda ploy --
"a direct attack" on Netscape's security model -- by Garfinkel.  There was
nothing in the Merc text that carried the hysterial pitch of the press
release FV posted to C'punks; nothing of the pious Crusade to Save
Electronic Commerce that set everyone teeth on edge.  FV's Stein and
Borenstein were presented as competitive businessmen, out to rough up a
competitor who had been getting too much uncritical attention.  (The long
sidebars on FV's technology are what you'd expect for the Mercury News'
coverage of a local SoCal contender.)

        The Murky News' "Chief Scientist, FV" quote -- Borenstein recalling
audiences in the White House, Treasury, etc., who declared, "We thought
that only the  NSA knew how to do this." -- was absolutely priceless.
Everyone who didn't need a ten-page memo to supply the technical and
historical context got the giggle. It's the Quote of the Week in Silicon
Valley and NoHo.

        Deftly, with a straight face, Garfinkel left Nathaniel standing
there with his pants down, wondering where the draft was coming from.  (Mr.
Borenstein, no slouch on-line, has faired far better in his give and take
among the Cypherpunks -- who in their rabid majority only wanted to lynch
him.)

        Your observations had me wondering if we read the same articles.
My thought: would that all  snow jobs were handled by journalists with the
same dry perspicacity!

        Now _that's_ a useful and on-target observation.

                                Suerte,
                                                _Vin
