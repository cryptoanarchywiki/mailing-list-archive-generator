I have been slogging away with my own SSL browser trying to make it
crash less frequently (it actually crashes more often than Netscape).

Before I started on the latest round of changes I had managed to PGP
enable the browser (using my own implementation of PGP) with two web
linked functions:

a)  In the mailto:  Link a PGPKEY="ABCDE" field contains the PGP
public key of the recipient the program then encrypts the mail before
sending it.

b)  In forms using mailto a similar function acheives the same.

I have almost certainly broken the PGP implementation through all the
work I have been doing on the code recently although I think I should be
able to sort this relatively soon.

In other words:

It has been done (ish) see
ftp://193.119.26.70/mktnet/pub/horse.zip

(It also covers 128bit SSL)
