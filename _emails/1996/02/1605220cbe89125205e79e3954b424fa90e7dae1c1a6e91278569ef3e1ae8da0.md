This is why we do not need a "true" democracy.  Why should any individual act in a way
that is not in his best interest?

The blanked-out concept here is the concept of "best-interest"

It would be *very* interesting to drag the collectivists into such a debate.

But they are wise enough to thread away from what is, to them, quicksand...

of the vast majority of individual in that society...
