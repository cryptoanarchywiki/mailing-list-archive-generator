And BTW, since they told you to disconnect your machine from the net, 
*where* exactly are they gonna find "lost e-mail" ?  Lying around
*clogging* telephone wires and optical fibers?  :-)

I can just picture the usual disclaimer:
WARNING: FIRE HAZARD!
if you let old, undiscarded e-mail accumulate in your modem/computer
it might catch fire!  E-paper is just as flamable as the regular one...

ROTFL!
