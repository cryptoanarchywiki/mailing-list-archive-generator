CNN had a piece on crypto last evening. Jim Bidzos spoke about 
selling RSA products to China, and lamented export 
restrictions. PRZ commented on crypto-enabled privacy. A 
voice-over warned of crypto use by criminals and terrorists and 
its threat to law enforcement and intelligence.


While not there now, presumably the story will be on the CNN 
Web site later:
