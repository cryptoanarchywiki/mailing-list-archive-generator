I would think that the action of a optical fiber amplifier is, in a sense, 
"negative loss," or the inverse of the kind of loss normally found in a 
fiber cable.  Thus, if quantum crypto can be done through a long fiber at 
all, the fiber amplifier shouldn't negatively affect it.  However, if 
polarization is important (and I know that "polarization maintaining" fibers 
are available) then I assume that the amplifier would probably also have to be 
designed to ensure that polarization would also be maintained through the 
EDFA (Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier.)
