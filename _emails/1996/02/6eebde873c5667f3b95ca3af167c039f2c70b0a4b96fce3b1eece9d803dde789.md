Does anyone have a list of who voted for and against this monstrocity?
Campaigns on the Internet made a difference in many campaigns in the last
election.  I am sure that we could help make that pressure felt in the

Maybe we can get canidates to sign their press releases with PGP.  Get them
to see that there are very good reasons for them to use crypto and have it
available for the general public as well.
