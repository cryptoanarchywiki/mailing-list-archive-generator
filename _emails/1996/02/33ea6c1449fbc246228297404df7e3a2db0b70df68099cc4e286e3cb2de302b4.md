No. You don't need "a wealth of dough/technology" either. Basically you just
need to create packets at a sufficiently low level in the protocol stack.
I'd say it's much easier to use a remailer, but then I'm biased. :)

Indeed, they can have the mail servers under their control emit pretty much
anything. It's nice to be able to launch the packets at a site ostensibly
not under your control, though, so the return path will really be cold.

Well, the sender needs to have some useful encoding of the recipient address.
You can hide the address by encrypting it (reply blocks) or you can use an
address you don't need to hide (nym accounts, newsgroups and mailing lists).
I can't think of any other way to do it right now.
