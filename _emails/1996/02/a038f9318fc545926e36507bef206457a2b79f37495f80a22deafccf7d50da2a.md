It seems to me that the actual result of the Chineese experiment in net
censorship will probably be something in between what the Communist
government is hoping for and what some hard line crypto anarchists are
predicting.  Nets and good crypto tools aren't going to make it possible
for everyone in China with a pc to discuss any subject without fear of
government reprisal, but the new technology will almost certainly result
in a significant loss of control for the state. 

Censorship will persist in China, but evading it will be easier and safer
than it is now.  Nets being what they are, it will be easier for people to
organize, and discussions and debates will probably be more productive
than they are now.  The pressures of crypto anarchy might not be strong
enough to liberate China overnight, but they will exert a powerful and
steady force towards liberalization.  Once Chineese society has coexisted
with a vibrant black information market for a decade or two, making 
things legal will probably seem sensible to most people -- no one will 
expect the sky to fall if people are allowed to speak their minds.
