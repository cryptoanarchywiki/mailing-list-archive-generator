Excerpted from today's Zychik Chronicle

The Los Angeles Times writes: "rivers raged through Oregon" [should say
"Oregon taxpayers sunk by Oregon government"]. "the regions worst flooding
in three decades" [should say, "State of Oregon has been wasting tax payer
money for 30 years"]. "At least 3 deaths were attributed to the flooding
[should say, "State of Oregon kills 3 more innocent citizens"]. "13 counties
were declared a disaster area [should say, "State of Oregon has been
screwing these 13 counties especially"] "And the worst is yet to come" [the
citizens will blame the weather]. "Rats by the hundreds started crawling out
of Portland's sewers" [should say, "The parents of Oregon's politicians and
bureaucrats came forward."]
