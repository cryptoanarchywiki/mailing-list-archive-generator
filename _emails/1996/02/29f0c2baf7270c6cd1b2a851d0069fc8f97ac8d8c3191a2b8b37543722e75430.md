| At <URL:http://www.osf.org/~loverso/javascript/track-me.html> find
| some interesting "surveillance" applications of Javascript.

	I pointed to a need for configurability for Livescript in
December (http://www.homeport.org/~adam/java.html).  Now, it seems
that Javascript a bigger security hole than Java.  We can turn off
Java, but only downgrade to version 1 to avoid Javascript.

	The problems in Javascript are due to (in no particular order)
lack of design for security, lack of configurability, lack of
authentication in scripts, and a lack of control over whose scripts
are run.

	A design for security would have compartmentalized Javascript,
so that it only ran with access to the browser main window.  It would
not have access to the screen, nor to disk, or memory owned by
Netscape, except where parts of Netscape *explicitly grant* access to
JavaScript.

	Configurability means Netscape OBEYS /etc/netscaperc,
/usr/lib/netscape/security.cf, or some other file that allows me to
turn off Java and JavaScript completely, as a security officer for a
company.  It would also accept restrictions from a gateway or proxy,
which could add http and or headers such as <JAVA=off> and
<Javascript=off> (and perhaps others.)

	Configurability also means that Java or Javascripts can be
made, in a sitewide manner, to ask permission to run, announce
themselves when running, log themselves, (source, output,
interactions, etc), not do things such as shrink below a certain size,
etc.

	The next needed feature is strong cryptographic authentication
in the Java/JS engines, such that only digitally signed scripts can
run.   Again, the site needs to be able to configure this, to say
'Only scripts signed by the Dalai Lama or Perry Metzger can run at
all.  Only scripts signed by Perry and the bank security officer can
get at my e-wallet.'

	The start of this is not complex.  Create a set of standard
headers that http-gw or other web proxies can add, so people behind a
firewall can have sitewide policies.  (Notice that this has the clever
effect of making locally written scripts runnable, since they don't
pass through the firewall, even if all we get is an on/OFF switch.)

	Add authentication services at several (site configurable)
levels.  Digital signatures, one time run tokens are easy to do.
They're not even that tough to do right.  (One time tokens would be
nice for meter-ware as well).
