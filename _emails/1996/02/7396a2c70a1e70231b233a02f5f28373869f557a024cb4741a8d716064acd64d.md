Indeed, congrats Steven, a swell, crackerjack story well told.


Flattering exhibits of Damien and DW.


Ponder the garish payback frontis-pieces announcing Steven's 
tale of "a throbbing collaborative network of potential 
crackers -- and, maybe, thieves and saboteurs." 


Steven, your credit sez the next book is "Crypto," about the 
revolution in cryptography.


Can you give a date for publication?
