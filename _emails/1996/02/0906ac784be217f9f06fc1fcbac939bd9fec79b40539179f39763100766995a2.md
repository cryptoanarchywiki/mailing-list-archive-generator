I downloaded this so-called "report". It doesn't even mentions PGP.
Gotta wonder why the 007 wannabe "experts" and the Big Business (BSA)
want you to only use 90 bits for your keys and why they've never heard
of PGP...

Anyone who listens to crypto advice from people who's purpose in life
is to listen to *YOU* gets what they deserve. I'll stay with PGP which
has a 2048 bit key.
