Now, I'm way (WAY) over my head on this forum wrt crypto. However, an idea --

ADC might mean Analog Digital Converter. LOB might mean Low Order Bit 
(singular). So, IPG may just be watching the LOB of an off-the-shelf analog 
input card. Rash speculation, of course. 

However, if true, a Novitiate Crypto Wizard might be prompted to ask: 

"Assuming I use an audio source to drive the ADC, which of the following would
yield higher entropy?:

	* Greatfull Dead 
	* Al Gore speeches
	* The Beatle's White album (at 78, backwards)
	* The hiss after the local AM station shuts down for the night.
"

:-)

	might actually coincide with my own - but probably not.
