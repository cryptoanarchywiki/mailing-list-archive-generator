If we're talking about a US-based, on-shore operation, the reason
why you should not be able to sell my buying habits, ethical
and legal, would be that I gave them to you in the first place,
for a specific purpose. If we're talking about Costa Rica, which
has achieved mythical status as a data haven in some future
cupherpunked world, thenwe're not in the US any more. We're
in the world of the Internet, of the technology-is-law life
that appeals to so many of us (including me), and you wouldn't
be able to track my buying habits anyway.

I'd be using the alpha.c2.org remailer, which would have conveniently
located itself in - where else - Costa Rica.
