I'm confused. Instead of you alone getting a copy of every reply, you'd
prefer the scenario where you get a copy of every reply, and so does 
everyone else on the cypherpunks list, because _you_ get too much mail ?
How does this scheme reduce the amount of email you get ?  Are you not in
fact subscribed to cypherpunks ?

(I have no objection to everyone replying to the list; I just don't
understand how this eases the burden on ZA's mailbox.)
