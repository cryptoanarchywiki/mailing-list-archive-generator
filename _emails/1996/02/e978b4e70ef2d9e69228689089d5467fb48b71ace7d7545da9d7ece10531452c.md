I strongly suspect RSA distributes source to those customers who pay enough,
with the caveat that the customers don't share it, of course. My company
does that, even with its most sensitive code (of course, for a lot of money
:-) ). I find it extremely unlikely (from just a probabilistic standpoint)
that this leak came from within RSADSI.

I would first suspect someone of disassembly, of which I am envious. Not
because I couldn't do it, but because I don't have time to install a new
CD-ROM drive, never mind sit down and read hex dumps and assembler.

My second suspect is a disgruntled or "Crypto Freedom Fighter" employee at
some customer's site. If this is the case and the given anonymous remailer's
(or remailers') integrity is (are) not compromised, good luck to RSA in
trying to prosecute: They're gonna need it.

This horse is out of the barn, down the road, and in the next county.

My one question: Who cares about RC2?
