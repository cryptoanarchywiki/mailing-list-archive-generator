The article starts with "SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- You motherfuckers in
Congress have dropped
over the edge of the earth this time." and gets better.

>The American Reporter, working in conjunction with other groups opposed
>to the CDA, commissioned a writer to produce a special article to
>celebrate Clinton's signing of the new the law.
>
>Steve Russell, the author, retired after 16 years as a trial judge
>in Texas and is an Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at the
>University of Texas at San Antonio.

>This article was specifically and carefully designed to be completely
>and utterly in breach of the CDA. If you are opposed to the CDA and
>you are not offended by the "seven bad words", you'll probably find
>it highly entertaining and insightful.

>OTOH, if you are easily offended and don't like bad language, JUST
>DON'T READ IT.
>
>If you are easily offended and like to be offended and then like to
>file Police Reports, please go ahead. After all it was written to
>help ensure that the CDA gets challenged in the courts as soon as
>possible.
