No, actually I haven't. 
 
I do seem to observe strange sounds of silence from lib'bers on the
cypherpunks list about the legislative body who passed the law, although
they must know about the law since they blast the "libera;" to "socialist
statist" President who signed it. 
 
I seem to observe similar sounds of silence from people who get upset at
ostensibly liberal Tipper Gore's godlike powers to implement, as a single
individual, some form of record labels while remaining silent about the
conservative forces supporting Gingrich clustered around fundamentalist
christianity who were calling for censorhip.
