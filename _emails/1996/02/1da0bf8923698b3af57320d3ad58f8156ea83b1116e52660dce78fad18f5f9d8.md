Things do work both ways.  Fill the web indexers with information on
yes voters to the CDA.

An Altavista search on ``voting record congress'' yields the URL:
	http://www.vote-smart.org/congress/votes/

Pick either House Votes or Senate Votes as appropriate, look for the
Communications category.

If people opposed to the bill were to attach something to their
.signature referring to their wayward congressman, it would make a
dejanews or altavista news search on that congressman's name most
interesting.  As Tim May has pointed out, this stuff will live forever.

A quick small Web page can be set up merely containing text like:

Andrea Seastrand (CA congressional rep, 22nd district)
Dianne Feinstein (CA Senator)
voted yes on the CDA, reward them appropriately in the next election
(Di-Fei will have to wait until 2002 :-( ).

Barbara Boxer (CA Senator)
voted no on the CDA.

Submit the web page via submit-it to as many indexers as possible.
