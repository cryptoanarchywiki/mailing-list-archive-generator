The Cypherpunks figure prominently in an article by Steven Levy, called
"Wisecrackers" (p. 128), about codebreaking efforts like last year's 
Hack SSL effort and Ian Goldberg's and David Wagner's crack of Netscape's
encryption.  A quick scan reveals what seems to be a sensible and intelligent
article.
