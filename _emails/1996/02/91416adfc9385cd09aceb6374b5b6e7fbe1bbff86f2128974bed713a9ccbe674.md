Actually, the song is deliberately ambiguous.  Because the phrase "Bad Boys"
is repeated at both ends of the verse, you can't tell whether it refers to
the cops or perps or both.  I don't know the origin of the song but I recall
in life or in fiction a special (Las Vegas?) police unit that called itself
the Bad Boys.  Certainly the Bad=Good reversal is well established in
popular culture.
