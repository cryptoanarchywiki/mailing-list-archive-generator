	He signed the military spending bill, too.  And, unfortunately
(because of the bigotry it reflects), being painted as protecting gays
isn't going to be much better than being painted as protecting
pornography.  My point is that Clinton _doesn't_ have the same "this
provision is unconstitutional" feeling about the CDA as he does about
the AIDS provision.
