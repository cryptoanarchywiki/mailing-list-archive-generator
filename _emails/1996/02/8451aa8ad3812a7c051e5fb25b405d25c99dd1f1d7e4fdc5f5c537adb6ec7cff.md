	I would have appreciated it if you'd sent this to me privately, or at
least didn't enclose my message to you (which was sent in private email). Among
other reasons, it is rather off-topic (unless one wants to count it among bomb
information available on the net).

"Multiple very thin flexible hollow tubes (1 mm ID? teflon?) filled with a
homogenous liquid 
explosive (for example, pure nitromethane), length accurately cut to produce 
the exactly desired delay.  Kept separated from each other by foam spacers 
to avoid inter-fiber detonations. Detonated from a single cap, with an 
intermediary chamber of liquid explosive to stabilize the shock front, the 
detonation wave travels along each tube simultaneously at (presumably) 
identical velocity."

It's a race, designed so that the detonation waves reach their targets (the
foci) at 
the same time.  If the detonation velocity was, say, 5,000 meters per 
second, an accuracy of 0.5 millimeter in length would produce a delay accuracy 
of 100 nanoseconds.

Whatcha think?

Now where did I put that pit...   <G>
