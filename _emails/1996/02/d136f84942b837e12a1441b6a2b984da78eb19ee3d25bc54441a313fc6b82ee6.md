OnTrack are one of the biggest data recovery companies in the US, there
are probably many others ... but some of the smaller operators are 
less well equipped with (software) tools ...

The biggest problem is that the guy has already re-installed DOS &
his wordprocessor, this has likely destroyed much of the residual
information about his disk layout *unless* the format operation left
'unformat' recovery information on the disk.  (Deliberate attackers
would likely know how to disable this.)
