ROTFL

But this is not nukepunks...

and that wasn't my point. There is considerable debate about whether
dropping the bomb was right. The moral clarity of a Gandhi, MLK, or (to
add someone who actually killed people, I think) Thomas Paine is much more
useful when you're talking about winning hearts & minds. 

If you have a choice, don't nuke.

But yes, sometimes ya just gotta nuke em.
