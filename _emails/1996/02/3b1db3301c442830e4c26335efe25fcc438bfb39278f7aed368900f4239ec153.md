Well, maybe something like using the same core algorithm but a very 
different (and better?) key expansion algorithm, for instance.

But what if someone reverse engineered an algorithm, worked on 
it a few months, and then published something on the net, with a 
different key set up routine, and a very similar core algorithm 
(different for one or two operations, but an improvement) and 
discussed it in terms of having constructed the algorithm himself.

It has nothing to do with anyone signing non-disclosure agreements, 
since if the cipher is widely used in popular software, sooner or 
later someone will reverse engineer it.

And my point is that what if somebody publishes something and offers 
it in the public domain that is strikingly similar but not the same, 
with no clear way to tell if it was invented separately or reverse 
engineered and fudged?

I can imagine a hacker doing that to another trade secret cipher... I 
can also imagine someone reinventing the same cipher if it's simple 
enough.

That's another problem with trade secrets.
