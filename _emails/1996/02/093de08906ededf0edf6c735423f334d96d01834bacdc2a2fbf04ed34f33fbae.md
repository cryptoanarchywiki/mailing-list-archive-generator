     As I recall, this is incorrect. Without a signature/physical presence,
it's the _merchant_ who is liable. Thus, a lack of (sufficient) encryption
is a problem for the merchant, who thus may decide to not sell products via
the Net - a loss for the consumer.

>CREDIT CARD SCARE TACTICS
>Sending your credit card information over the Internet is really no big
>deal, says Simson Garfinkel, author of a book on Pretty Good Privacy
>encryption software.  "The whole thing about encryption over the Internet is
>that it's not to protect the customer -- it's to protect the credit-card
>companies.  By law, if there is no signature, the customer is liable for
>nothing.  If there's a signature, they're liable for $50.  The reason the
>credit-card companies want cryptography is to limit their own liability.  It
>has nothing to do with protecting the consumer."  And although Netscape
>Navigator sends a stern message each time a user attempts to send
>information over the Web, Garfinkel labels the warning just another scare
>tactic:  "Netscape Navigator is printing those messages because they're
>trying to sell encrypted servers.  It's an ad.  It doesn't look like an ad,
>but it is."  (Tampa Tribune 19 Feb 96 B&F3)
