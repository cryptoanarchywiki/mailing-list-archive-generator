Nope, not necessarily.  Hypermail goes off of different headers than most
MUAs do (it's a slut: it'll use anything it can find).

Too bad it dumps core on Message-ids that don't have greater-thans or less-thans
(or did: that's the latest round of patches that I sent off to be ignored by
 its author).
