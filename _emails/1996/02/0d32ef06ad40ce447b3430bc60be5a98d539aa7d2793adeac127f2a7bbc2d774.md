The affiliation of the authors is interesting:

----
by Paul A. Strassmann, US Military Academy, West Point; and Senior Advisor,
SAIC
and William Marlow, Senior Vice President, Science Applications
International Corporation (SAIC)
----

Now, what were people saying about SAIC and its role in intelligence
