Jeff,


You shoot electro-ammunition straight, so your credibility is 
solid. HQ should take target practice from you. Although 
explanations on this list may not be comprehensible to the 
public, or to NSCP's PR Dept.


What are the chances that NSCP might add a feature that would 
allow customers to say yes or no at login to tracking their 
movements at any site visited, with a friendly notice that 
tracking analysis was being done?


That might redeem the exchange value of cookies, and perhaps 
come closer to gving customers equality with the merchants, and 
merchants credibility with customers. As you are giving 
Netscape here, despite Wall Street's treachery.


Thanks for your even-tempered and well-aimed potshots here.


John
