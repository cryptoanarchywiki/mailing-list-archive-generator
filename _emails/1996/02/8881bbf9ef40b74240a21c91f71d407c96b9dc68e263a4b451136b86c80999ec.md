Perry, fractions of what you say are true, but only small fractions,

Stubborness and stupidity are twins - 

Save all those lives you were talking about a few days agao, show us how 
easy it is to break the system - and reqad the messages form others - you 
are spouting a bunch of supercilious crap and everyone else knows that, 
except maybe you, you are obviously too stupid to recognize that - please 
save all those lives at stake
