  Friend, 
 
 
  02 08 96 Associated Press newsstory datelined Washington, headlined 
 
                 COPYRIGHT VIOLATORS SHOULD FACE 
                       CRIMINAL PENALTIES 
 
  reports: 
 
     The House Judiciary Committee's panel on courts and intellectual 
     property is considering legislation...to clarify copyright law for 
     electronic information. 
 
 
  Panel = subcommittee.  Its chairman is Carlos Moorhead, R-CA.  He says 
   
                the legislation [is] a "skeleton bill" 
 
  which  
 
        "We want to make sure we get...into law this session." 
 
 
  The skeleton of the skeleton law = "recommendations by the Clinton ad- 
  ministration." 
 
  Moorehead also says: 
 
     " We don't want to put so much meat on the skeleton that it dies of 
     obesity." 
 
 
  Testifying before the subcommitte were 
 
     the Motion Picture Association of America's Valenti and 
 
     Broadcast Music Inc's Preston 
 
  who "agreed that the legislation should be passed quickly." 
 
 
  Preston and Valenti  
 
     rejected a proposal by Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., to exempt on-line 
     service providers from copyright infringement liability.... 
 
 
  So there goes cheap access to the 'Net. 
 
  That's what 
 
     "We don't want to put so much meat on the skeleton that it dies of 
     obesity" 
 
                                 MEANS! 
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim
