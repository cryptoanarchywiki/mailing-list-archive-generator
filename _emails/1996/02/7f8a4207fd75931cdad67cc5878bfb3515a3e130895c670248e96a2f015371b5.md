   2-26-96. FT:

   "Net's rivals feel the squeeze. A quiet revolution is
   transforming global electronic trade."

      Value added networks (Vans) such as GEIS and Advantis
      are already at risk from the Internet, according to
      Price Waterhouse's *Technology Forecast*, a panoramic
      sweep through today's electronics, from chip designs to
      video compression software. Electronic commerce, the
      forecast says, has become a worldwide phenomenon,
      reshaping marketplaces, trading relationships and
      international trading boundaries.

   2-27-96. NYT:

   "AT&T Makes Belated Move On Internet." John Markoff.

      AT&T is to introduce a service Tuesday that it hopes to
      use to link millions of its long-distance telephone
      customers to the global computer network. Analysts said
      the entry by AT&T was certain to alter the competitive
      landscape for ISPs. It will offer relatively inexpensive
      dial-up access to the Internet and the Web to personal
      computer users at home. Company officials said pricing
      will "be aggressive enough to make the industry sit up
      and take notice." "You're about to see a new AT&T," said
      an analyst. The service will use Netscape for browsing
      and a search tool designed by Verity Inc.
