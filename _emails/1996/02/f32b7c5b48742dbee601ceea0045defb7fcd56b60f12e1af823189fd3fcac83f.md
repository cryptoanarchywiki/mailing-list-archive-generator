Needless to say, I disagree.  Government does not possess ANY "rights."
Merely powers.  Secondly, the Constitution says NOTHING about the authority
of the Federal government to "regulate" (or, for that matter, even merely
MONITOR) communications cross-border.  Sounds to me like you're arguing the
statist line.
