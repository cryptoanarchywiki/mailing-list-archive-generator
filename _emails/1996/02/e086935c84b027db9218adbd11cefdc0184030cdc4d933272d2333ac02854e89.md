No, those are managers. (Have better equipment at home anyway 8*).

The ones I know who could, don't. Is considerably harder to write an
antivirus program that can account for Zenith ZDOS 3.21 or the original
PC-AT BIOS than a virus that blows up if you run it under NW-DOS.

You missed my point (and my canary trap). When a Pentium starts up it is
in 8086 "real" mode and is limited to the same 1 Mb basic address space
(know about the 64k - 16 bytes, is different from 8086/8).

What I was referring to was the "640k limit" imposed by 1-2-3 waaaay back
when - is stored in Bios data area (0:400) and CMOS.

Actually I prefer WordStar 7.0. Magazines and the gov like WordPerfect.

Have been warped. Have Liniux & FreeBSD. As for Win95, why would I want to
degrade my system ?

Wasn't a challenge (though getting something to work on a "strange" NCR
notebook like mine might be 8*), never saw a BIOS leave dangling interrupts
following POST before...)

It is not that they are written badly, just that most virus writers lack
experience and their worldview is narrow - the [Mich] we mentioned - is
obvious not that the writer did not know how to handle floppies, rather that
all he/she/it/other knew of were either 360k or 1.2 Mb. "Nightfall" writer
had apparently bever seen a Zenith 248 kit 5 BIOS. Ludwig's LBB boot sector
virus will only work under Dos 3.3 because DOS 4-up leaves different
values in the registers.

No, you can get *some* programs to run and on your machine you may get *all*
your programs to run. But they will not run on *any* machine.

Type 7 ? Nothing magic, just different.

Strength from diversity 8*). 

Meanwhile, back at FV, if someone wants to break it badly enough, they'll
buy one (or one of the FV employees) and take it apart at home. No
"professional" would attack anything that she/he did not already know
how to break. A *real* professional would buy two or three just to see
if they were all the same. Is the same problem with the "Sidewinder 
Challenge" though it did get a lot of print.
