> Here's something I did about Senator James Exon:

In my protest against the Hon. Jim Exon, I went to his office this week
and dropped off a printout of indecent speech that I have on the Justice
on Campus Project:

   http://joc.mit.edu/lawsuit/examples.html

I told the bewildered receptionist that his boss was to blame for making
me a criminal.

I'm now a plaintiff in the ACLU/EFF lawsuit challenging the CDA, BTW.
Two articles on our lawsuit are at:
