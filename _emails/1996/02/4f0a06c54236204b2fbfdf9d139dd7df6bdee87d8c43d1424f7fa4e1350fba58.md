I have a copy, but I have not yet verified the key sizes.  It is on my list
of projects.  (My current project is for determining if an app is accessing

I might need the DDK to compile it.)

        `finger -l alano@teleport.com` for PGP 2.6.2 key 
                http://www.teleport.com/~alano/ 
         Is the operating system half NT or half full?
