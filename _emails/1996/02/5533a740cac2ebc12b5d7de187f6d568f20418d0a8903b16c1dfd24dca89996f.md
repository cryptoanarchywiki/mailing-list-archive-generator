They could use no stock software, and they would grind every machine
in the country to its knees doing the signatures. RSA signatures
aren't cheap.

Furthermore, you couldn't check the signatures at the other end fast
enough and it would probably be easy enough to steal keys. I doubt
this would fix their problem.
