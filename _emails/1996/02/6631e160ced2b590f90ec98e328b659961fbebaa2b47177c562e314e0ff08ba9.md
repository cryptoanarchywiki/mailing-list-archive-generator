Doubtless that is why they assume chips that are very far from state of the art:

Since interprocess communication is trivial for key cracking, 
you are better off using large numbers of cheap chips, than 
smaller numbers of good chips.

Again:  Interprocess communication is trivial.  A brute force key cracking
machine is *not* a general purpose massively parallel computer.

Suppose you have a million chips.  Each chip tries keys.  A few bytes 
of the plaintext, headers and stuff are known.  Assume eight bytes known.  
Then we could handle the interprocess communication with a single desktop 
computer.
