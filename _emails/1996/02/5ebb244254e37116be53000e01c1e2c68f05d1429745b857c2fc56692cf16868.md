I love to be picky about such things.  Yes, I think bosons _DO_ interact 
with each other.  Before all you physics nerds flame me, hear me out:  
Photons, while they have no "rest mass" do indeed "gravitate" (they are 
energy, recall?).  In a reference I can no longer find in my 1970 
Encyclopedia Brittanica, it stated that a cubic mile of sunshine "weighs" 
1/100,000,000 of a milligram.    From another source (or maybe the same 
one?) it stated that the photon "weight" in a cubic centimeter of volume at 
the core of a star such as our sun (or at the core of a nuclear explosion) 
is about 1 gram per cubic centimeter.

Thus, presumably photons self-gravitate, and thus, SOME bosons "interact," 
although admittedly this kind of interaction is a few dozen orders of 
magnitude lower than what you probably intended when you said "Bosons don't 
interact with each other at all."
