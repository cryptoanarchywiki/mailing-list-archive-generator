Note the SAIC name in the byline.  Note that CIA folk have often
published stuff and not fessed up to having a CIA background.

Anonymous remailers are the number one threat to total control via
government.

If you read something anonymous you can discard it simply because the
writer is unwilling to stand beside his words.  Or, you can see if it
is an apt piece of writing and decide that it does apply, even without
an author.

This thread is part of a "school" of such topics now reaching us
through various media.  Note the recent news made by an internet
announcement that a girl was being abused by her mother. Kids are said
to be making bombs from instructions via the Internet (and why were
they making so many bombs learned from libraries and colleges before
and not even making it past the local news?).

Some people don't like utterly free speech.

My most serious question about anonymous remailers is this:  How can we
be sure that the operator of such a remailer is not a federal or other
governmental agent?  That person is trusted with our privacy and has
all the data needed to identify a user.

If I were the Feds I would already have set up such a "sting"
operation, the temptation is just too great.
