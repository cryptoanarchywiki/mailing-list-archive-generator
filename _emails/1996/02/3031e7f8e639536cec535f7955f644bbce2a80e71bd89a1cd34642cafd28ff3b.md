Between irresponsible online behavior and media-spins, such as the example
posted by Mr. Young, will probably make '96 the year of the remailer wars.
If they're not out-and-out banned in the U.S. by '98 I'll be surprised (but
damned happy.)  Hats off to HRoller and Broiles who've fought the good fight.
