	That does have its problems. I've got the same sort of dilemma in my
life; to take government funding (for science) or not, when I disapprove of
most such funding. I wind up deciding to, because otherwise the funds in
question could be spent less efficiently on science (thus further wasting
taxpayer funds) or on something even less legitimate (i.e., the Wo(S)D), given
that bureaucratic budgets tend to be decided by who uses up the most money.
	I can justify this by that one would pick a target that had done
something directly wrong: participating in the writing of a bill that violates
individual rights. In other words, pick a target that deserves it enough, and
striking back at them is justified. The problem is the old ends justify means
debate.

	You have a point.
