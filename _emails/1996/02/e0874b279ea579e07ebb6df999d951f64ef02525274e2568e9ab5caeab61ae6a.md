One important point here is what is "reasonable care"?  In a very real
sense, all consumer computer operating systems are not secure.  I have
posted a theoretical virus born attack on PGP's secret key to the
cypherpunks mailing list (archives at http://www.hks.net/cpunks/). 
Nathinal Borenstein of First Virtual has posted to the same list, a
description of a partially implemented attack on credit card numbers which
has received heavy response.  If there is enough reward, these attacks will
occur.

The question I have is, does "reasonable care" include keeping your machine
"virus free"?

The historic precedent is the liability limit on nuclear power plants.

For both these problems, a relatively low liability limit would force
people to use other techniques (e.g. old style signed contracts) for large
transactions.  While we are working the bugs out of a new technology, with
new standards of "reasonable care", everyone might win if the risks are
limited.


>PRIVACY

I believe the area of privacy is where the real problems lie.  I will let
other, more qualified, people suggest alternatives to the Utah law
proposal.
