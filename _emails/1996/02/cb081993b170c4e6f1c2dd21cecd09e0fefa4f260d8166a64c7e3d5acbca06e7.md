I'm sure that Rich vs Declan is exciting but I have to agree with Declan
that the more Zundsites the merrier.

It rarely pays to be subtle with nation states.  They don't have good
information processing capabilities.  It helps to really hit them over the
head with things.  It also means more to the public if you can say "Sure the
Germans banned this site but we put up a dozen copies within a few hours."
It is this casual ability to defeat nation states that is the significance
of the net and should be emphasized.
