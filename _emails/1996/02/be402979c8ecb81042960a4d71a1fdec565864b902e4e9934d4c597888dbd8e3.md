A similar method was (is?) allegedly used by H.M. Government depts (and no
doubt others) in restricted documents: the apparently even spacing of
letters along a line to acheive proportional spacing was in fact slightly
uneven and different on each copy, so a whistleblower (or spy) who
photocopied and leaked a document in their posession could be identified
if the copied document were examined.
