Looks like good news for a change... Senator Leahy is expected to introduce
a bill tomorrow with some of the following language; no S-number as yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

      "It is the purpose of the Act:

      (1) to ensure that Americans are able to choose the most appropriate
  encryption method to protect the security, confidentiality, and privacy of
  their lawful wire or electronic communications; and

      (2) to establish privacy standards for key holders who are voluntarily
  entrusted with the means to decrypt such communications, and procedures by
  which investigative or law enforcement officers may obtain assistance in
  decrypting such communications."

  AND:

      "Nothing in this Act or the ammendments made by this Act shall be
  construed to:

      (1) require the use by any person of any form of encryption;

      (2) limit or affect the ability of any person to use encryption without
  a key escrow function; or

      (3) limit or affect the ability of any person who choses to use
  encryption with a key escrow function not to use a key holder."
