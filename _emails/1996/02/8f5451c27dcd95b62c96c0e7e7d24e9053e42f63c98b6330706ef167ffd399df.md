Anybody got some good URLs for info on anonymous remailers for novices and
experienced users alike?  I need to know which are which so I can hand them
out like candy to my .edu friends who aren't _as_ net savvy, but aren't
dumb as dirt clods either.  Much appreciated.

that are not crimes... A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very
principles upon which our government was founded."
