-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

In a project relating to the need for anonymous remailers, I would like
to find out about someone in particular. (I would like to do so without the
resulting information getting circulated any more than it probably already
is.) Specifically, I have a full name and an email and am curious how much
information can be collected. (whoever has those US-population CD's, that's
the kind of thing I'm looking for) Preferrably I would like to go from
the email address only to a SSN or address or something unique, but I will 
make the two of them my starting point if necessary. 

The point being, of course, that anonymous remailers are the only thing
that keeps many email addresses from becoming a life history.

Anyone who can help me research please send PGP encrypted (key 0x994b8f39)
mail.

Thanks
