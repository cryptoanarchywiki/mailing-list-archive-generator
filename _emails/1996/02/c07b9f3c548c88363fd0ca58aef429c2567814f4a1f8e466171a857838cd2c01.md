Even if operation of such a system is "outlawed," the government would still 
have to TRY to enforce the law, which would be mighty difficult.  Remember, 
the whole system is based on anonymity, which means it'd be hard to get 
witnesses to any overt act.  And we have 1st amendment issues to consider:  
If this system were operated from overseas, it would be difficult or 
impossible to restrict communication with the main organization, etc.

I believe that the enthusiastic support by some well-known software company 
(even if they didn't intend to actually run or assist in the running of the 
operation itself) would make the politicians shit bricks, leading to a 
cathartic national debate that we sorely need.

I don't deny that such an organization might spring up.  (Anti-abortion 
activists are the group which come most immediately to my mind, BTW.  I'm 
not in sympathy with them; quite the opposite.)  I've never claimed that 
this system is totally immune to such abuse, in the same way that the seller 
of a gun can certify that it will never be used to commit a crime.

Fortunately, "Assassination Politics" will achieve this "crypto anarchy" 
even if only a tiny fraction of the population participate and use it.  The 
reason is that the number of decision-maker government employees is 
comparatively small and most will resign before being "terminated." (with 
extreme prejudice.)  The total cost to bring down the US government will 
probably be substantially less than $100 million.

I realize that this takes a bit of thinking to recognize.  I've thought 
about this whole thing for nearly a year, now, and it is still a fascinating 
and yet a bit terrifying subject.

Again, only a tiny fraction of the population needs to participate...

I've been asked what I think would be the average payoff for a medium-level 
government official "kill" would be.  Naturally, that would be 
market-driven, but it is reasonable to assume that most of the payment for a 
CURRENT contract killing is based on the risk; not merely the risk of doing 
the job and/or getting caught, but also the risk of dealing with (and 
trusting, etc) the other guy.  I suspect that the vast majority of 
convictions for contract killings occur not because the killer was caught in 
the act, but because of these relationships associated with it.

Since "Assassination Politics" promises essentially perfect anonymity to the 
donors as well as the "predictors", the majority of the "risk" associated 
with having such a job done would be far lower than currently.  I estimate, 
therefore, that you could get "action" for around $10,000.

Since "Assassination Politics" is based on a combined-donation system, even 
people on a subsistence wage could contribute; a quarter here, a dollar 
there, pretty soon it turns into real money.

I understand your concern.  I wish there was some simple argument I could 
give which would assuage your fears.  However, I look at it this way:  The 
Federal government (and all other governments, around the world) are 
curently parasites on the rest of the population.  Now "parasite theory" is 
that the parasite has some sort of optimum "parasite level" above which he 
cannot go.   Once the cost for such parasitism is removed, there will be an 
economic boom for those "hosts" of the parasite.  Naturally, the parasite 
will be in trouble, but that's only justice.
