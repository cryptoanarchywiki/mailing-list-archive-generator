>>>To whoever may read this,
>>>
>>>This is not a typical letter, in that by passing it on to as
>>>many people as you can, you are taking part in what may yet become the
>>>world's biggest practical joke. The U.S. Government has rece ntly
>>>passed an act which enforces censorship on the internet. A group of
>>>internet users has now come together to kick back at this oppression,
>>>and have a bit of fun at the same time. >The aim of this exercise is
>>>to re-establish the United States as "The land of the Free", not a
>>>fascist state where freedom of speech and thought are curtailed.
>>>Communist Russia fell as a result of s uch limits being placed upon
>>>the minds of the general populus. On receiving this letter, please
>>>pass it on to as many friends or E-mail lists as you can. We predict
