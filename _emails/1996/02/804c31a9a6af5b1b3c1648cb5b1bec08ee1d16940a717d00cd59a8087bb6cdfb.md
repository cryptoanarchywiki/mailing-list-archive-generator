C'punks,

I easily had 100+ people at my party last night.  Attendees on
this list are invited to share there impressions, but as far as
I could tell it was a resounding success for crypto-anarchy
solidarity.  

There will will be some great pictures on the Web site sometime
this week (http://www.c2.org/party/masquerade.html).  Amond them
will be a picture of Sameer dancing like a madman, Annette Haven,
the movie star I promised you (a legend of X-rated films) and 
your's truly, driving home a point about the CDA during an
discussion with Romana Machado, plus many others.
