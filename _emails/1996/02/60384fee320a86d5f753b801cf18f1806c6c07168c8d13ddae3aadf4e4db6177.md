Hi CPunks.

I went into www.umass.com, somewhere into it up untill I could find an e-mail
adress, and mailed this letter:

While I do not believe nor endorse the neo-nazi movements and their ideas, I consider interesting to be able to look at their arguments, if only to make my own opinion of them.

I understand that you banned a WWW site providing such information.  I also understand that this site presented this information to oppose the german govt. in their censoring actions against some such sites.  I do not have a first hand knowledge of the content of the specific site (Zundel) that started the whole thing and I am convinced that many other pro-nazi might use some material presented in a decent way for quite questionnable ends.

But nevertheless, from what I read, you seemed to have banned a site out of political correctness.  I hope it is not true.

Unfortunately, freedom and liberty, thoses crutial and typically american values, seems to be eroded first by thoses trusted to protect them: the american intellectual and scholar.

We live in a very sad world, where reason is dissapearing slowly, being replaced by fear and low animal instincts.

Please pardon my poor english.

Jean-Francois Avon
