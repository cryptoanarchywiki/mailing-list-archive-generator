There is a theory which states that the correct way to unsubscribe from
mailing lists is defined by the mailing list charter and principles, and
that sending misspelled "unscribe" messages to the wrong place, and
including "unscribe" messages intended for other lists, is bizarre and
inexplicable.

P.S. to Ewout: Send a message to "majordomo@toad.com" with a body message
consisting only of "unsubscribe cypherpunks".
