The code looks something like this:

1) hook into the winsock and look for an FV message in the web data stream,
save the ID.

2) now look for an approve/deny/fraud, when you see one you know that the
user uses 
an IP connection for mail and web.

3) Forward the ID to an anon box.

4) Look for outbound FV messages with 'fraud' or 'deny' and change to 'approve'.

Clearly this will miss AOL, CI$ etc al but thats not important.

The issue is not FV noticing the error, they will, it's how long it takes
 and how much you can steal in the interim.

There is a Helen Keller quote I'm rather fond of which starts:
 "Security is mostly a superstition ..."

  *If the machine is not secure all bets are off*

The most likly failure vector for this attack is that so few people use FV :-)
