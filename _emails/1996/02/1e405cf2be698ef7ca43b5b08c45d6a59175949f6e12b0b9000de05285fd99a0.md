   This can be fixed as easily as allowing the protected MIME part to be
an S/MIME signed message. The S/MIME spec will need to recommend that
mailers deal gracefully with this case; if not, there will be user
interface disasters. I'd recommend that mail readers treat recursive
encrypted and signed S/MIME messages identically to non-recursive (i.e. 
PKCS #7 native). Even better would be for the RSA's S/MIME toolkit to be 
able to perform the translation automatically.

   I agree with Brad that it needs to be fixed. If a large installed base 
of S/MIME clients gets deployed that cannot handle the S/MIME format 
hiding the signatory, then we will have failed in an important way.

   Agreed. The changes to PGP could be good, bad, or some combination. My 
real point is that whatever the reasons have been for PGP's success or 
failure, they won't resemble much the reasons why PGP will succeed or 
fail in the future.

   One of the action items from the conference was for the contenders to
converge on any pieces that were not gratuitously different. For S/MIME
and PGP/MIME to simply adopt receipt and labelling standards, even to lift
them wholesale from MSP, would be well in accordance with this goal, I
think.

   Hear, hear. My point is that it isn't just cypherpunk advocacy of
strong crypto. Any company that ships a 40-bit product is going to get
badly burned by well publicized breaks. Their customers are going to feel
betrayed. They thought they were buying a "secure" solution, but they
weren't.
   Perhaps this is putting it a bit strongly, but using the word "secure" 
in conjunction with a 40-bit produce borders on fraud. Perhaps it makes 
more business sense to defend against the ITAR on First Amendment grounds 
than to defend against fraud charges on ITAR grounds. If not a lawsuit, 
then a disillusioned customer base, which is just as bad.

   I think we just did. The only other way for the field to reduce any
more is for PGP to tank (unlikely), for RSA to drop S/MIME (unlikely) or
for MSP to disappear (won't happen entirely - witness X.400).

   I was speaking about others ;-). A lot of people have announced that 
they're going to implement S/MIME. The remaining question is whether 
they're really going to do so. Without sticking out my neck and naming 
individual companies, the impression I got is that they are.

   There was support, but was there consensus? My brain is just too fuzzy 
to remember.

   Absolutely.
