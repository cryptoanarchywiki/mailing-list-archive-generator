Odd that you would say this, even more odd that you would post it to the 
Cypherpunks list.  The only reason I am posting this is that you appear to 
be taking a remarkably similar position to Alan Olsen.

Then why didn't you send me the email directly, and NOT copy the list.  
Somehow, it appears you have a double standard.  The only reason I'm 
responding to you now, ON CYPHERPUNKS, is that you appear to be 
hypocritically asking me to "keep it off the list" at the same time to 
failed to do the same yourself.  Sounds like a double-standard.  Your 
behavior is remarkably remeniscent of Alan Olsen himself.

>  If Alan posts responses to the

It's been pointed out to me that because Alan flamed me in public, 
anonymously, on Cypherpunks, I am entitled to have it known what he did.

I think you're deliberately pretending to misunderstand.  I have nothing 
against anonymity.  While a "newbie," I was under the impression that the 
term "stable nym" (my usage) refers to an anonymous alias that is 
untraceable.  In fact, it was _I_ who suggested that this anonymous flamer 
(now apparently self-admittedly identified as Alan Olsen himself) adopt a 
stable nym and debate me on some other area more appropriate for the 
subject.  While I do feel there is CP relevance to the digital cash/good 
encryption/network applications of "Assassination Politics," I didn't want 
to force this on what I would like to think of as a "not particularly 
political" list.

(Recent topics have battered the distinction, I realize.  I don't want to 
make it "worse," however.)

The point is, some people seem to agree that what this anonymous flamer did 
was against "nettiquette," or at least against CP typical behavior.  Had he 
made his criticisms with a stable nym and been willing to sustain a serious 
debate (possibly on another area) that would have signalled that he was 
believeable and serious.  He was not, however.

"..other nutty political theories"?  Harummmph!  Well, I guess you got your 
"not so subtle" dig in, there.  I'd like to see a bit more widespread 
approval of such a discussion before actively starting it, anyway, 
especially by some of the "old-timers" here.  (Sadly, as I newbie, I don't 
really even know who the "old timers" are!)  But recently, there's been too 
much traffic anyway!

Not necessarily.  As I pointed out before, I'm happy to debate a stable nym 
(a term I learned only a few weeks ago, BTW).  But completely anonymous 
flames from a person who cuts and runs does not improve the S/N ratio of 
this or any other list.

I didn't want anybody to even be able to use the excuse of "I feared for my 
life debating with that vile purveyor of that wacky idea, 'Assassination 
Politics.'  "    I invited him to use a stable nym.

You may be surprised that I absolutely agree.  However, the post was not 
merely "anonymous" but flaming, and the poster didn't stick around.  In 
other words, its anonymity didn't do it in, the motivation of the poster 
did, however.

But on the other hand, a flaming "debate" on CP doesn't help any of YOU 
guys, the other readers of CP.

No, I merely translated "Olsen-speak" into language most of the rest of us 
could understand.  He had that right.  On the other hand, the exercise of 
this right displays Olsen's behavior for all to see.  I wanted there to be 
no doubt on the national list what Alan Olsen was doing.

I am, too.

As long as the record reflects his misbehavior, I am satisfied as well.
