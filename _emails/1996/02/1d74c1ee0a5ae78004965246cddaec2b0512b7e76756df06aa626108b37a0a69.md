Marketing Fluff - read "we don't *want* to revel it".  Patent stuff doesn't
take long to get the initial disclosures filed.  Cypherpunks are 
generally engineers and are immune to such crap.

So.  Large "random" prime numbers are generated.  From what?  How?
Obviously these act as keys to your "OTP".  Figure out how to 
match this prime and you can generate the same "OTP".

So the data coming out appears random.  Big whoopie.  Lots of algorithms
can generate the same thing.

The key is how do you seed that random number generator? 

This isn't even close to being a OTP.  A OTP by definition has a random
set of data that is transmitted to the receipient over a seperate
secure channel from the actual message to be sent.  The actual message
and the OTP are XOR'ed together and sent.  The receipient then XORs
the OTP and the encrypted message to get plaintext.

That is pretty simple - even a marketing drone should be able to figure
that one out.

Now - explain how (in generic terms) your system acts as a OTP.

Yes - hopefully someone will take the time and money to decompile it.
.... but if you are so sure of yourself,
why not give away some demo copies.  Why not source of the security
functions?  (Shove that patent crap someplace - you wouldn't be 
selling it if your disclosures weren't already filed)

"unbreakable" - Bullshit - you obviously don't know crap.
