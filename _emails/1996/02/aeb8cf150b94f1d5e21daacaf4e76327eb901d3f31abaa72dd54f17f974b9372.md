In my opinion, only the most basic of services, trash collection, road 
maintenance, education (decided upon experts, not just people with opinions. 
I don't claime to be an expert on history, so why should I have a say on how it 
is tought, I have no expertise in that area).

In a true democracy, which is based on a very diverse general populace, will 
result in a system that will not be able to pass any legislation except those 
described above, it will be imporable for the majority to agree to anything 
except the most basic things.


Why I hate this goverment is that it tries to decide what is right and wrong, 
that is my decision, not theirs.  I am accountable to me and my God as to what 
I do with my life, I am not accountable to any society as long as I do not 
infrige on someone elses rights.

Unfortunalty, I don't see such a goverment happening, I don't care about if 
anyone else likes the way I choose to conduct my life or not, but the majority 
of any country has this assine persistance to perpetuate their traditions and 
beliefs on others, it is their form of progegation.  It's true what is being 
said  sometimes you just gotta Nuke'em
