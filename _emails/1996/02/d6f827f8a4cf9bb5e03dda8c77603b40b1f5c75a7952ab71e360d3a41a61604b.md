	come on Lewis...  where's the sight <sic> address? 

	on a little more serious point; the use of multiple high
    bandwidth proxies is fast becoming essential to screen your
    address from the enquiring target, thereby forcing the Feds to
    use either very extensive sniffers or the power of the subpoena (not 
    much luck if the records disappear nightly...).  The only clinker is 
    the big sites are startig to require registration with legal warnings 
    --next of course is payment and they want a credit card --not a check
    or cybercash --a credit card for open debit.
