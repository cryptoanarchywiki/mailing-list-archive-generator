	And that alternative was killing many hundreds of thousands of
people, Americans and Japanese, military and civilians, in an invasion
of Japan.  Have you looked at how many Japanese soldiers fought to the
death while the US was 'island hopping' toward Japan?  Do you think
that they would have been less willing to fight to the death when it
was the home islands themselves?  Especially since many of the
military leaders were arguing against surrender after the _second_
bomb was dropped?  Sorry, but 'war is hell'.
