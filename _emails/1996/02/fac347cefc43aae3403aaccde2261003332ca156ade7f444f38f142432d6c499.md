Yes, but isn't there a fundamental difference here? Cypherpunks are
pushing for the spread of encryption to enhance our personal
freedom. But when the FBI says that "the real solution is through
better technologies such as encryption," they fail to mention that
they wish to restrict personal freedom through such things as
GAK. This is why it is so ironic that he is draped in the flag. "It's
the FBI: crusaders in defense of the first amendment!"
