  Friend, 
 
 
      A 02 11 96 Bloomberg newsstory from Cannes, headlined 
      ----------------------------------------------------- 
 
              EUROPE'S ONLINE INDUSTRY TAKES SHAPE, 
                     COMPETITION HEATS UP 
 
  reports: 
 
   Even as they increase their subscriptions in Europe, online 
   services are beginning to work on the legal and social aspects 
   of the services they are providing. 
 
 
  How very thoughtful! 
 
  But what do they have in mind? 
 
  Jack Davies, president of AOL International, has the answer: 
 
   The issues involved are "bigger than a prosecutor in Ger- 
   many, bigger than just Germany, it's a global issue.  It in- 
   volves a legal structure that may not have kept up with the 
   technology and I think as an industry we have to work very 
   carefully through this issue." 
 
 
  Expanding from the Reich to the globe, what does Hans have in 
  mind? 
  
                   DEUTSCHLAND UBER ALLES! 
 
 
  But when it comes to contracting,...Jack's in charge. 
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim
