I don't think that you understand one thing.  If we (the users of the
internet) say that X-THING is unacceptable on the internet, we open up the
floodgates for everything else that ppl what to censor.  There are better
ways to keep children from looking at sites and spams like the one you
posted.  Parents.  It's their responsibility to keep their children from
getting into this stuff on the net.  If we allow the govt. to take care of
our issues and do not take responsibility for them ourselves, we deserve to
have a big brother who can take care of us (see what I mean?)  No control
can be given to the govt.  If it comes down to it, we can have a rating
system like the movies and music.

Our lists are moderated, BTW, so that we don't have to wade through a bunch
of irrelevant data while trying to read about the lists/newsgroups topic.
Some of my favorite groups are alt groups, and as much as I hate having to
read about Grubor all the time (please ship him off to a dessert isle), the
moderation would limit the scope of the groups and interesting, sometimes
relevant pseudotopics would be gone.  I want the psudotopics!  That's where
some of the best threads get started!  But moderated groups have their
place too.  Who wants to read a bunch of trolls while trying to read a
science group.  And soc.support groups would not be of much use if flamers
and lusers kept posting disruptive and disturbing articles.  But in all the
cases here, it is we, the users, who decide what stays and what goes.

Peace to all.
