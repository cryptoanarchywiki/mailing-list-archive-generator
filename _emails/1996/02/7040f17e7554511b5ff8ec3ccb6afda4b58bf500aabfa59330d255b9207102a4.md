   2-20-96. FT:

   "Cash versus cashless."

      Assays Y/Ns of e-cash and declares DigiCash the winner
      for its privacy and anonymity. Echoes DC privacy mantra
      and sketches DC/DC tests underway by the EU. Compares
      froth of issuers, fear of banks and so-what of 
      consumers: "Physical cash already offers consumers a 
      product that is universally accepted, convenient, 
      anonymous and has no direct costs."

   2-20-96. WSJ:

   "Security Sytem On the Internet Contains Flaw."

      Two Purdue University students discovered a major flaw
      in Kerberos that could allow a hacker to penetrate
      corporate networks in about 5.8 seconds, giving another
      black-eye to electronic commerce.
