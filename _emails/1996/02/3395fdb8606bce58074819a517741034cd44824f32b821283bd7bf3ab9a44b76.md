Similar notes have been posted to the newsgroups and faxed to a number of
press critters in Germany, Canada, and the US. The Ottowa Times is
probably going to be the first out with a reasonably in-depth story. If
you have something of import to say, I'll give you the reporter's number. 

We won already. OK? I believe even the Wiesenthal Center is waking up to
the fact that the only acceptable and efffective way to deal with evil
lies in the modern age is by drawing them into the open and smothering
them with the truth. They should have a statement shortly. 

Share and enjoy.

Declan et al, I sent the enclosed to the white supremacists' moderated
mailing list in order to foster the free flow of information, and Don
Black approved it for distribution. Now they all know about all the 
mirrors. 

Since there is no longer any censorship, and since Zundel has released a 
press release about how "major universities have come to his defence" 
against this Zionist repression, I believe it would be appropriate to 
express our true feelings now. Of course copyright and good taste 
dictate that his pages remain on the Web completely unedited, but I see 
no reason for them to be the only thing there.

I would recommend adding a link to the following additional publications
of Zundel's, which were similarly "censored": 

 http://www.almanac.bc.ca/hweb/people/z/zundel-ernst/flying-saucers/

To prevent the saving of bookmarks within his site, I further recommend
moving his pages into a subdirectory with a name that changes from time to
time, as I have done. 

I apologize for blowing up at Declan. The link text from my page to his
again reads, in part: "My friend Declan's page has some more developed
ideas, most but not all of which I agree with. He has more time for this."

You might want to consider this on your own sites. An IP filter is no 
good if the IP address changes.
 
I would also suggest holding your own press conference on February 28th.

Thomas Leavitt from WebCom tells me that Telekom has blocked all accesses
to hosts within the webcom.com domain, though WiN has not. 
 
Apparently Spiegel TV is interested in reporting on this. One of their
reporters told me that the AntiDefamation League in NYC has been compiling
a list of offensive resources (primarily web pages, I think) on the
Internet. 
 
They're going to hold a press conference on February 28 to "demand reduced
access" to this material.

Anyway, this is all moot, because there are so many holes in the 
censorship curtain. See the full list of mirror sites and supplemental 
documentation at any of the following, all accessible from any computer 
in Germany:

The Berlin Wall has fallen.
 
Next stop, the Great Firewall of China.
