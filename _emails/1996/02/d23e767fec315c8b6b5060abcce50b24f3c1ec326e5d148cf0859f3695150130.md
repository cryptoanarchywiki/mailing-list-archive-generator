I'm not entirely sure what you mean. Present remailers don't save anything
except for (parts of) RFC 822 message bodies, and occasionally some SMTP
mail headers. Certainly no packet-level headers (like IP) are saved at all.

Presumably The Chinese Wall (and many other gateways, routers, etc.) would
simply drop any packets that managed to arrive without originating IP address
information. You could use something that emits packets with "incorrect" /
"forged" IP headers, but that crosses an ethical line that I consider rather
important not to cross. The IPsec WG has been working on interhost 
authentication that should render the point moot, anyway.
