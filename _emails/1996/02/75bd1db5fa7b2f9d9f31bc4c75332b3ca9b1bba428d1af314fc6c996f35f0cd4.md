>If the intent is to motivate others to kill or otherwise harm others simply
because you don't agree with them or their actions is reprehensible and
moraly or ethicaly undefensible.
-------------------
	So you don't believe in self-defense, or the defense of another? While
I'm not as sure as Jim whether such a system would just be used by the good
guys, if someone has taken action to seriously violate the rights of another
I can see the death penalty as being appropriate.
