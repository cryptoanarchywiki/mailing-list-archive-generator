I say we elect Jim Bell, then kill him.

More seriously (or maybe I was serious), an "Internet party" just makes 
no sense to me. There's far too much diversity of views for the Internet 
to be a "party." Perhaps the "Internet party" could take shape as a 
corporatist pressure group, but hte record of corporatist systems is not 
great. 

I'm happy with the EFF and such remaining special interest groups with no 
partisan political baggage. "No entangling alliances," as Washington 
said, and no compromises.
