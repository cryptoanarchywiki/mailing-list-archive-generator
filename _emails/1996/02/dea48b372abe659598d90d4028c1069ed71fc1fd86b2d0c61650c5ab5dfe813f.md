No she didn't! She brought us voluntary labelling, which is completely 
different. Some local governments have then tried to use those labels to 
commit censorship, but that's illegal. Ms. Gore's attitude is and always 
has been that parents should be responsible.

 Exon's CDA (Chicks, Dicks, and Arseholes) is different because it
restricts content by law, including material protected by the first 
ammendment.

 The Administration has repeatedly stated its belief that those parts of 
the bill are unconsitutional, and does not intend to enforce them. 
Unfortunately, because the rider was attached to such an incredibly 
corporately popular bill, it would have been politically impossible to 
veto it for this, epecially since they believe that the courts will throw 
out the (ir)relevant parts. These corporate interests in getting the bill 
past also make's those who did vote against the bill in the house and 
senate especially deserving of praise; they won't be getting many 
Telebucks this year. maybe CypherPAC can reward them?
