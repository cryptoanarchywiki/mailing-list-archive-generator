On an ecouraging note, I recall a Packet Radio case where someone posted 
what amounted to an advertisement for a 1-900 service.  Commercial 
advertisements being prohibited on all Ham Radio, the FCC moved to 
censure ALL of the dozen-or-so packet stations which had automatically 
forwarded the offending message.

Great alarm was raised in the packet community, and I believe it was the 
ARRL which enlightened the FCC that enforcement in such a manner would 
destroy packet radio by requiring each message to be manually inspected 
prior to retransmission - an obvious impracticality.  (Even though the 
letter of the law may have permitted such a strict enforcement by the FCC.)

In the end, only the ORIGINATOR of the message was "punished."
