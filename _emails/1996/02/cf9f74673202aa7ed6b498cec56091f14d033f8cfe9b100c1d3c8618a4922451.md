They already have one of the best compilations of racist links on the 
Web, which according to posts on Stormfront-L is often used by the Aryan 
Overloard types (snicker) to keep tabs on each other.

There are some copyright and ease-of-updating issues associated with 
mirroring the opposition's files. PGP authentication of Web pages would 
help. I've offered to show Zundel how to do it, but for some strange 
reason, he hasn't been answering my mail as promptly as he used to.
