Does anybody have a list of crypto software/algorithms
 that are forbidden for use without GKE in france?   

More specifically, I would like to know about the 
algorithms used in :
 - PGP (IDEA, RSA, etc.)
 - blowfish
 - 3DES

What I am really after is *precise* information, 
with references to official govt documents if possible,
about the restrictions on thoses algorithms and/or
key size limits (if applicable).


Thanks.
