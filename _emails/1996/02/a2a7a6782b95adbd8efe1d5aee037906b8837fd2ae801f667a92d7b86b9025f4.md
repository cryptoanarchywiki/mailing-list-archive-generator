                 White House Site Blocked

Add the White House to the Internet's extensive list of dens of
sin.

Surfwatch, a widely used software program that prevents access
to, and downloading of, sexually explicit material on the
Internet, accidently blocked access to the White House home page
recently - all because a "White House for Kids" Web site address
contained the word "couples."

That's a dirty word in the Surfwatch universe because many
sexually explicit online sites use it as part of their come-on.

In this case, "couples" merely referred to the Executive Branch
tandems of President and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Al and Tipper
Gore.

Surfwatch fixed the problem within hours, although some might
still find the site offensive.

For political reasons, that is.
