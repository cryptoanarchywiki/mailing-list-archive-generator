  There is a lot of confusion about cookies.  They do not allow
a web site to access private information such as the user's
e-mail address or other preferences as was recently reported
in Web Review.  They only store information that the web site
already has.  If you never give a web site private information
about you or your identity, they will not be able to match your
access patterns to your identity.
