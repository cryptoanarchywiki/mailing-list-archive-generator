I don't agree. The theory of natural law is basically that when people 
come together to form a society and create a government, they enter into
a social contract. If a member of the society breaks the contract (by, 
say, blowing someone's brains out) that member has breached the contract and
can be punished by the government. Similarily, when the government breaks 
the contract (by say, killing off an ethnic minority, or maybe banning 
indecent speech) the government has breached the contract and the 
government may be destroyed. To say that the law is always right because it
is the law, is to defend ethnic cleansing, book burning, detention camps, 
taxation without representation, slavery, and all the other evils 
governments have done, while condeming those who would free slaves or 
fight in revolutionary wars. Making something a LAW does not make it 
right.

Agreed. Though we must fight to preserve it.

Read the fourth amendment. :)

Most legal limitations (outside of indecency/obsenity) on speech are 
concerned not with the speech itself, but when speech becomes an action.
Yelling fire in a crowded theater is NOT A CRIME. Insiting a riot in 
which hundreds are killed, just for the hell of it, is a crime. 
(Just clarifying)

A good point, but I don't know if those who want to ban crypto will think 
about it that way. They will assume that it will be obvious who is using 
crypto and who is not. They will leave it to the courts to determine 
what is crypto and what is not. Obviously they are wrong, but thats not 
gunna stop them from enacting laws. Of course, as another person 
responding to my post pointed out, *good* stenography cannot be 
identified, so laws are not gunna stop people from encrypting, it will 
just make it kinda difficult to get away with.
