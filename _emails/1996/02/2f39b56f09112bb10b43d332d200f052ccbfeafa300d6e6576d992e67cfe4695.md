The problem with the CDA in this regard is that it doesn't seem to
respect other jurisdictions. It's very irritating for us in other
countries to know that if we put 'indecent' material on our world
readable sites, then we commit a crime in the US punishable with
2 years detention, even if chances of prosecution, extradition or
Noriega-style international arrest are minimal - so far; we all
know that there is now only one de-facto superpower, and that power
could do anything it really wishes to do. But USA still wants to
look good and possibly law-abiding on the global market of morality,
so I think the international legal system ought to be investigated,
by lawyers knowledgeable in the field, for possible processing of
the CDA in the International Court in the Hague (by a non-US person
or organization).
