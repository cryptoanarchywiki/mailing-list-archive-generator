You must also then know that you do not always get what you want with a 
pent - sometimes you do not get anything, or not enough to cover you. 
Until we know, we are reating much of the material as trade secrets, as 
we are sure you would also do. Once, you discover how simple the system 
is to install, use, update, and add to, you will understand our concern.

Starting with an OTP as seed? The algorithm may be fixed in a sense, but 
it employs a truse hardware random OTP to select intial settings, adds, 
and limits, so every one is new and unique - a lot of algorithnms can 
generate pseudfo trandom numbers, but onece you knw the algorithm, you 
can generate the random sequence. Our system does not do that - in 
oReder to solve the system, you must know what OTP was used, that is what 
was the true hardware generated OTP. Unless you know what that was, 
knowing the algorithm does nothing for you. If you understand that 
principle you understand the system.

Perhaps so, but our system does employ a true hardware generated OTP, and 
operates similiar to what you describe -  however, the important 
differernce is that we use a smal;l OTP to generate a larger OTP, like 
stringing the cable across the Golden Gate narrows. Just becuase we 
convert over from a full OTP to a prime number wheel system configured 
from the OTP doers not mnean that the result is not an OTP - in theory it 
is simple to break RSA systems, but factoring a 2048 bit number, or 4096 
number, or whatever, makes the problem enormous  - our system for large 
messages/files is similiar in difficult except that it is much nearer 
an 8192 bit number than 2048. The possibilities to be examined ar4e so 
large, that iot is not possible to solve then with a computer, even if 
all the particles in the iuniverse, all 10 to the 80 power of then were 
a Cray T3E, or better.  Furthermore, all you would get would be all the 
possiblilities which would be everything!

I believe that you have some basic grasp of OTPs, but obviously you do 
not understand how the Golden Gate Bride Cable was strung: A 
string, a rope, a small steel cable, all of the cables - we employ a 
similar technique to fdeliver the follow on OTPs.

Time will prove one of us wrong, and that wiill prove to be you - it is 
unbreakable as a thoprough examination of the literature will reveal.
