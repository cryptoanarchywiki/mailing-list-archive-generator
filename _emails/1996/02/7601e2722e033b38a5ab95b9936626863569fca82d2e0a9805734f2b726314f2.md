I have "standardized" the PS files on the MS website, so there should 
be no more problems. Sorry for the inconvenience.

| Has someone here managed to extract PostScript hardcopy of the
| CAPI from this Web page? I tried earlier this evening and
| wound up with a miniature
| ecological disaster on my hands. The page says:
|
| "For ease of online reading and printing, we've provided copies of this
| lengthy document in Microsoft Word and Postscript formats."
|
| I grabbed the ZIPped PostScript version and unZIPped it, which resulted in a
| single file called "capiapp.ps". Making the wild assumption that this was
| indeed a PostScript file, I sent it to the printer and forgot about it for a
| while.
|
| An hour later I discovered a chaotic scene in the printer room, as the
| printer had spewed about 1.5 reams of raw PostScript printouts. The 
output bin
| had overflowed for a while, spraying paper in several directions. 
<heavy sigh>
|
| As it turns out, the file unhelpfully begins with
| 	%-12345X@JPL ENTER LANGUAGE=POSTSCRIPT
| preceding the usual "%!PS-Adobe-3.0" line. Worse still, it appears that the
| capiapp.ps file is actually a catenation of many PostScript files (one per
| chapter?), each beginning with a version of this ensnarling line.
|
| I could do some global search-and-replacing, etc., but I think I'll wait for
| Microsoft to distribute a decent PS version of this document. Perhaps they
| should consider not generating it with MS Word....
|
| Grr!
