  Actually that position would in fact be quite inconsistent with our
more recent actions.  For example we have implemented blinding code to
protect against Paul Kocher's timing attack, even though it has
not been demonstrated against any real world system.  I think that you
are misinterpreting the intent of Jamie's posting, but I will let
him defend himself.  I just wanted to say that the company takes
security problems very seriously, even if there has not been an
active exploit.
