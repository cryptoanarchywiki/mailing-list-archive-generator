Ok, so I've got my BeBox and so finally have an SMP of my own again; 
anyone want to suggest any cool crypto stuff that parallelises well?
Rogaways hashs look interesting, and nDES offers an obvious process 
network for pipelining, but what about things like running multiple 
interleaved CBC streams in parallel, with each stream starting off from a 
different IV? I can't think of any practical ways of speeding up a single 
RSA operation, although twice as many processors obviously gives twice 
the thruput.
