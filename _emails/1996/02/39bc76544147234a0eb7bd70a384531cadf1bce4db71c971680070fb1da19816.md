    I don't recall who made the comment that X.509 used IA5, but I was
the one who noted (wrongly?) that IA5 had no representation of the at
sign ("@"), and instead used a lower-case letter "a" inside of
parentheses.

    I remembered it then in context with all the work I'd done on the
X.400 projects tying together the DISA cc:Mail and the OSD MS-Mail
backbones, and I'm still quite convinced that at least in the context
of the systems we were using, this is exactly what IA5 meant.  There
was much wailing and gnashing of teeth over this one, because it made
our directory sync and directory query stuff all that much more of a
pain.  It could even have contributed to the stillbirth of those
projects, the omnipresent and oppressive spectre of DMS not
withstanding.


    Now, perhaps the definition of IA5 has changed, and if so, then
that's great.  Or maybe DISA and the X.400 we had (not too unrelated
to the formless but very chilling DMS) were badly broken and this is
what they made us live with.


    In any event, if X.509 certificates don't have this problem, then
that is wonderful.  It's another reason why we might want to support
X.509v3 certificates as an absolute minimum acceptable standard.

    I await the wisdom of Steve Crocker to be visted upon us regarding
the use of ASN.1.  I do know that, from general principle, the mere
concept of being forced to go out and buy something like an ASN.1
compiler just so that I can implement a parser for a format seems
abhorrent in the extreme.  Not to mention the additional complexity,
unwieldiness, and sluggishness it lends to the final product.
