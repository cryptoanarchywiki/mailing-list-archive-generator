--------------------
	To their credit, yes. One application of this that others may be
interested in is that ILL requests (I have been told) come from a library, not
from a library's user. Thus, when I made one and got it back from the CIA's
lending library (yes, they have one), they didn't know who I was...
fortunately, given the book in question. Sort of a lesson for things like
sites, et al. If all that someone can tell is that a IP or whatever request
came from a particular site, then traffic analysis and other such things are
disrupted. One way to do this would be to set up fictional accounts
automatically to serve as proxies (relayed to the real account), which would
make it impossible for a normal proxy-detector (lack of information or a
particular set of information) to filter them out.
