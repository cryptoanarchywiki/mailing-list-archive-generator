The NYT Sunday magazine tomorrow has a longish article on the 
federal Witness Protection Program. It traces in detail one 
family's entry, the arrangements for the "death" of the old 
identity and the new "birth," and describes the unsettling 
nymity transformation.


It also lays out the ballooning cost of a program once thought 
to be relatively cheap.


Some techno stuff about carefully orchestrated communication 
between the relocated family and relatives.


Is everyone in the galaxy still able to get free and easy 
access to the NYT Web site at:


     http://www.nytimes.com


?
