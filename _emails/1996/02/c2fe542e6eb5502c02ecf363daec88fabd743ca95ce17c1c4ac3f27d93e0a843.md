The protocols for both Usenet and the open mailing list were designed with the
assumption that the posters will follow the rules and post into "appropriate"
forums. This sort of worked 10 years ago, when I started reading Usenet, but
clearly doesn't work anymore. People should be free to post anything they want
anywhere they want. As more and more posters excercise this right, the readers
lose the right not to have their time wasted by the traffic they don't want to
see. A good friend of mine called this "the right to non-association". It's an
imporant part of one's privacy. While we have some technical people left on
this mailing list, perhaps we can discuss technical solutions to this problem?
