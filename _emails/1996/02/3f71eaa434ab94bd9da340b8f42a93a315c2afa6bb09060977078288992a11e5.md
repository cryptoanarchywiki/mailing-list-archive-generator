Nope. The VB program should give a popup window where you can enter your
passphrase to sign/decrypt the message. Such a popup can have a <NO> button
if you don't want it to do its thing.

But how often do you receive an encrypted letter for which you have the
secret key, and don't want the letter decrypted?

Actually, I was already working on such a program when these posts came by,
so any suggestions to functionality are welcome!
