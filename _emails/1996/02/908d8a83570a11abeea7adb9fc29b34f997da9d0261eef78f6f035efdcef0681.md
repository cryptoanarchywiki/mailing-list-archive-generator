I got email because I got linked to; this is the first I've heard of it.
AltaVista's upped the stakes on WWW data collection.  Apaprently aqui
(the spanish word for here) is a "link" database -- it lets you make
links and profile who would be interested in them.  You can register
(altho the intro page says "I wanna play anonymously" as a link) and
get links of interest to you.
