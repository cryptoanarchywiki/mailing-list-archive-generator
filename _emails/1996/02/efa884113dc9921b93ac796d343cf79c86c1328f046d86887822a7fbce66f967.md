Hello:

I have been noticing that the sizes of the Public PGP Key Block
on some of your messages are different sizes. 

When I set up my PGP key pair, I selected the largest key size
which was 1024. It then gave me a public key block that look
like this:

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6.2

mQCNAzD5t24AAAEEALSR4OvQ9lfGpTjqDsuYgtCtI9eYC82E29VO6tL6cBDNCWc/

tBxNYXJrIEFsbHluIDxhbGx5bkBhbGx5bi5jb20+
=Q3/s
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

This is only 4 lines and a few characters long.

I have noticed that some others have public keys that are
larger than this. I have noticed one public key that is about
10 lines long.

What is happening here? Are there keys that are bigger than
1024?

I am using the latest PGP that is available from MIT.

Please help!

Thank you!
