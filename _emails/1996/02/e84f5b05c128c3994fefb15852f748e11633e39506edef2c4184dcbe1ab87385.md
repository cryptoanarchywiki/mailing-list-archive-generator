A few psueudorandom points regarding this post:

        First, it seems silly to implement a separate standard that only
works for the credit card number.  What about the privacy of the rest of
the info (what I am ordering, how much, etc.).

        Can (or will) this be layered with Netscape's SSL?

        How is this to be implemented?  It sounds like the merchants will
just pass the encrypted number to the credit card company.  If this is the
case, key management could become an issue.  I suppose this could easily be
implemented using public key crypto, but only DES was mentioned.  If only
DES is used and everyone uses the same DES key, that would be a valuable
key to break!

        How about a MITM attack.  Get the encrypted credit card #, and
change the purchase amount, delivery info, etc if that is not encrypted.

If there is anyone on the list with more info on this, I would love to hear
it (heopfully we will hear something from Netscape, since they are quoted
in the article).  From what I know so far, it seems like a poor compromise.
