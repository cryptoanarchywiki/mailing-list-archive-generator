  Friend, 
 
 
                            (1) 
 
 
  The Centre de Recherches Mathematique is hosting a year-long 
  program in combinatorics and group theory in 1996-1997.  The 
  year will be organized around a number of workshops spread 
  throughout the year. 
 
  Among the workshops: 
 
 
        WORKSHOP ON PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATION 
 
                       06 03 / 28 96 
 
 
  The CRC's at the University of Montreal. 
 
  Details: 
 
               ACTIVITIES@CRM.UMontreal.CA 
  
                          or 
 
               http://www.CRM.UMontreal.CA 

 
 
                           (2) 
 
 
  If you'd like to read RFC 1750, "Randomness Recommendations 
  for Security," but you're too busy to ftp, email 
 
                mailserv@ds.internic net 
 
 
  and in the body of the message include the command 
 
                document-by-name rfc1750 
 
 
  In due time it will arrive in 2 parts. 
 
  At the end of the 2d part:
