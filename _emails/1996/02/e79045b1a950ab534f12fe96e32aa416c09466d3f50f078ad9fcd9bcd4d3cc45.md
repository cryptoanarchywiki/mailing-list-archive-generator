Anyone heard of DSN? I think thats the right order of the initials...
... its supposedly the only crypto-hardware solution for protecting an 
entire network on the Internet. You put one of these $5,000 units at one 
end of a lan, and another one somewhere else on the Internet, and the 
company gaurantees secure, encrypted transmissions. The TCP/IP headers 
and data are mangled, encrypted, etc.

It uses 512bit keys and I was just wondering how the authentication is
done. Does anyone have any specs on these units? Supposedly it does not
require a 3rd party entity to verify that the two units are both valid,
when determining the initial public/key pairs. Perhaps there is hardcoded
data in the units that is used to verify this? The company supposedly has 
some proprierty method ... how can we be sure this expensive unit can do 
its job if information on the encryption has not been released. 

Is there any freeware software solution that has been put through more of
a torture test, and proven to work? It seems to be the best approach would
be to put such a program on a server that is acting as the
gateway/firewall on each network. 

(define(RSA m e n)(list->string(u(r(s(string->list m))e n))))(define(u
a)(if(> a 0)(cons(integer->char(modulo a 256))(u(quotient a
256)))'()))(define(s a)(if (null? a)0(+(char->integer(car a))(* 256(s(cdr
a))))))(define(r a x n)(cond((= 0 x)1)((even? x)(modulo(expt(r a(/ x
2)n)2)n))(#t(modulo(* a(r a(1- x)n))n))))

           "SGI and Linux both run Motif and X11.  They both compile c++
                cleanly (using gnu g++). They're the same!"
