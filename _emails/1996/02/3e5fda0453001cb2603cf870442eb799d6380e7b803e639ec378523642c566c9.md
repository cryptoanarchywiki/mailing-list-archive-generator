   Although it has not been completely settled that disassembly is a
legitimate form of reverse engineering, the trend has been to consider the
two equivalent. So, whoever posted RC2 had at least a good idea of how to
present it. 
   I don't think it would be be a good idea for them to come out and sue RSA
for libel for the accusation that it was misappropriated however.
