You probably had no problem with seat belts being manditory eqiupment ,
because they 
protected YOU and the people YOU cared about. 
You probably had no problem with manditory airbags, public building smoke
alarms, unleaded
fuel, restaurant health codes,etc....Because they protected you and or
people you care about,
even though they cost YOU more money.

 though I walk through the valley of laziness and deficet spending I shall
 fear no evil, for the government is with me. It prepareth an economic utopia
 for me by appropriating the earnings of my grandchildren. It filleth my head
