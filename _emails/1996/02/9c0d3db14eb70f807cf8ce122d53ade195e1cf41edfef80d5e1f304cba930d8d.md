Exactly.

Further, in an earlier message Bruce Baugh asked why some remailers did not
more promptly remail their messages. Bruce, you need to look at Raph
Levien's statistics on remailers, inclduding batching/latency: rapid
responses tend to defeat the traffic analysis features of remailers!

Also, preserving subject lines through remailings, another feature Bruce is
requesting, is kind of like barium-tagging one's messages! Why use remailer
chains if the messages are tagged all the way through?

(There are wrinkles that work, such as adding a subject line based on stuff
stored inside the encrypted block a remailer opens for furhter processing.
The nth remailer can add a suject line that may be different for every hop,
or only added near or at the end of the remailings...)

Those who want more "user-friendly" remailer features would do well to
think about what the properties of an "ideal mix" are.

And for "casual-grade remailing," where no encryption is used and where
minimal other mix features are used, there are Web pages that will send
simple messages through a user-selectable remailer
(http://www.c2.org:80/remail/by-www.html).

This Web remailer will _not_ automatically add a .sig, as it is not a mail
program per se, and the only text that is remailed is what is entered into
the on-screen window.
