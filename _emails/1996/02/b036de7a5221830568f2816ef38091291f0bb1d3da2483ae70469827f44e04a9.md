I would have thought you and Colin would have some communication with 
Phil regarding PGP3, since PGP is his trademark.

The web page referred to it as being in beta, so maybe they are 
working with the old specs... could also be that they completely 
rewrote and improved on the old version.

(Of course if I have questions I should address them to ViaCrypt...)
