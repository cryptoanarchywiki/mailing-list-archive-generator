Oops, Jeff, for the fun mirror; gotta watch these pseudo-random 
walks, what with all the Net security deals favorably affecting 
more and more c'punks.


BTW, the full REM_ote package includes articles by The Wash 
Post and Fin Times, each of which have slightly different 
descriptions of your clearly respected, and valuable!, company.


And another BTW, I hope you got a respectable slice of the 
buyout pie. If so, keep in mind as you consider where to 
dispose of your new hard-earned wealth that I design extra 
virgin fancy houses to camouflage impenetrable, and not-at-all 
cheesy, Swiss vaults.
