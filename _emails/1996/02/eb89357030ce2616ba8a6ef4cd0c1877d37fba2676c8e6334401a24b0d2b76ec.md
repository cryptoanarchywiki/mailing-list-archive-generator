	I'd like suggestions from people on what style/grammar checker is best
for reducing this kind of interpersonal variablity (and increasing the
intrapersonal variety by only using it sometimes). I use Grammatik 5 on some
posts, and it does seem to help.

	At least for the synonyms, I'd hope that a good grammar checker was
seeing if you weren't using a very large vocabulary. That's one problem I have
with Grammatik 5, in that it doesn't do this very well.
