Declan:

Please take down the "build your own Zundelsite" files immediately,
because it appears that they are being used improperly. Surely you do not 
want to violate Mr. Zundel's copyright.

Ingrid/Zundel:

I am pleased to hear that you do not agree with Mr. Bunkley's use of your 
materials.

You should pursue legal action against Mr. Bunkley for copyright
infringement. I think an injunction and a seizure of assets might be in
order. 

I'm serious. Think about it.

Please let us know which of the mirror sites linked by Declan are 
authorized. I know mine and Declan's were, and I assume that you approve 
of the partial IHR mirror.

Because so many unblocked mirror sites currently exist, I have restricted 
access to my mirror to stanford.edu and a few other places.

A limited number of closely controlled mirrors is certainly in your
interest, because then it wold be much easier for you to update them. For
example, your lack of control leads to the perception that well after
Nizkor responded to your call for open debate, you have still not
acknowledged their response. You look like a bunch of liars claiming that 
Nizkor won't answer you. Surely this is not what you want.
