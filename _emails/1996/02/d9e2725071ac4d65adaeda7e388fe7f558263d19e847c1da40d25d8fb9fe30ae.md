	A land invasion of Japan would've likely cost half a million
	American lives, and perhaps a million or more Japanese
	citizen lives, according to comprehensive studies I think
	are on the mark.

Sorry to inject a little scholarly research on this topic, but I
would urge those of you who are interested in how this mythology
was created and disseminated to do an AltaVista serach for Alperovitz;
he's potentially the leading scholar on this subject.  I've read
his book, and Tim probably ought to as well ...

If you read nothing else on this topic, I urge you to check out
an interview with him at http://www2.ari.net/home/bsabath/950711.html
