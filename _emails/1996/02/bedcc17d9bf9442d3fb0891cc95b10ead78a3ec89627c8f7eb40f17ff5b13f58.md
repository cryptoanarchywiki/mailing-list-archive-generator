The statements i have seen as to what the V-Chip (The V stands for
"Verbage"), it will not be that selectable.  You might be able get a version
that will not show you anything with a sex rating less than x, but then the
thought police will come and take you away.  (Crimethink in the presence of
minors is punishable by death.)

You have to remember that such products are brought to you by "People
Against Fun In Our Lifetime(tm)" and the "Hell On Earth Foundation".  Any
misuse of such products will be against Federal Law.  (Similar to the laws
on other household products.)
