Verisign will offer a number of levels of certificates.  The
certificate that Jeff refered to requires only a unique email address
and is available for free.  For obvious reasons you should not trust
theses keys for credit card information or anything else that you feel
is confidential.  This is why Navigator allows you configure what keys
you accept as well as what certifications you will accept.
