                 The Digital Commerce Society of Boston
            (Formerly The Boston Society for Digital Commerce)

                               Presents

                             Mark Bernkopf

                        Tales from the Dark Side:
                       Non-Anonymous Digital Cash?


                        Tuesday, March 5, 1995
                               12 - 2 PM
                   The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
                     One Federal Street, Boston, MA



This past autumn, Mark wrote a couple of studies on electronic money.  He
will offer some general thoughts on likely winners and losers of the
cash-card competition.  Mark opposes totally untraceable electronic cash.  He
is skeptical of private currencies, although he concedes one type of private
currency that might succeed.


Since late 1993, Mark Bernkopf has been an economic and financial policy
analyst at Bruce Morgan Associates, Inc., a small international consultancy
in Arlington, VA.  He prepares a semi-annual World Economic Outlook, and
writes on such subjects as central banking and monetary policy, currency
boards, the economics of Korean reunification, derivatives, bancassurance,
and industrial policy.  His firm's clients are mostly Middle Eastern
governments and large East Asian corporations and thinktanks.

In previous "incarnations" Mark served at the Clinton White House Office of
Communications and at the Open Market Operations Department of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York.  He is a Wharton grad and a clandestine contributor
to Pasi Kuoppam√§ki's "Jokes about Economists and Economists"
http://www.etla.fi/pkm/joke.html



This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held on
Tuesday, March 5, 1995 from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of the
Harvard Club of Boston, One Federal Street. The price for lunch is $27.50.
This price includes lunch, room rental, and the speaker's lunch. ;-).  The
Harvard Club *does* have a jacket and tie dress code.

We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or if we *really* know
you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by
Saturday, March 2, or you won't be on the list for lunch.  Checks
payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will have to be sent
back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The Harvard
Club of Boston".

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've had
to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for instance), please
let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something out.

Planned speakers for the following few months are:

 April       Donald Eastlake  CyberCash
 May         Perry Metzger    Security Consultant and Cypherpunk
 June        Dan Shutzer      FSTC
 July        Pete Loshin      Author, "Electronic Commerce"
 August      Duane Hewitt     Idea Futures

We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on the
first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a presentation to the
Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program Commmittee, care of Robert
Hettinga, rah@shipwright.com .
