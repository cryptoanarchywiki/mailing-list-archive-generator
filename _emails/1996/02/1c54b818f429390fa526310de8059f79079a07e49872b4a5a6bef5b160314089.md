	While it fortunately seems that the German government is getting some
sense, I've had one idea for future such anti-censorship efforts. It's that,
despite Alta Vista and other spiders, sometimes things on the web don't get
spotted by search engines very soon. Having information out there doesn't do
much good if people who haven't been following newsgroups, etcetera don't know
about it.
	Rich and Declan may have thought of this already, but I haven't seen it
on cypherpunks. There is a web page for multiple search-engine submissions at
http://www.submit-it.com/. I don't know how well it works, since I haven't used
it (yet). But it might be something to try.
	-Allen
