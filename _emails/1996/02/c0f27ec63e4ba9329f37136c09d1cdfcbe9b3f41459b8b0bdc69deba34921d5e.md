Might want to be careful calling Marianne a borderline liar. She's our host
for Cypherpunks meetings at Sun, where's she's in the Java group. The
article didn't make it clear that she's with Sun and not Netscape. She's
also been coming to Cypherpunks meetings since the beginning, and posts
here occasionally.

I'm sure she can speak for herself, but she may not see this comment for a
while, hence my comment here.

As for the substance of her remarks, best to let her elaborate. Though,
knowing journalists, it's quite possible that her "remote" remark was
embedded in a much longer comment, which the reporter chose to cut.
