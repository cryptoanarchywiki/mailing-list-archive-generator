I realize that Phil Z. is an "icon" to many people, but icons sometimes are
overrated. In this context, I mean symbolic icons, or logos, e.g., little
pictures.

Why is an icon or logo preferable to "Begin PGP signed..."? The little
rose, or chevrons, or escutcheons, or whatever, then have to be explained
to people. "PGP" is actually its own best logo.

(There is also the important point that most uses of PGP are in
primarily-ASCII settings, in e-mail. Yes, I know that MIME and whatnot can
support graphics, but such uses are rare. Look at this mailing list, and
Usenet, for examples of how most messages are composed. I routinely delete
all messages that have "attachments converted" to them, and others have
told me they do the same thing.)

Logos and signs typically are useful to attract customers from afar, as
with roadside signs, or to establish consumer preference. In the case of
PGP, neither situation seems especially germane.

Finally, the idea of a "contest" and a "vote" comes up once again. Being an
anarchy, no one is stopping anyone from attaching logos to their articles.
But I can't imagine a "vote of CPunks."
