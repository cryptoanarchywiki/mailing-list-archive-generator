<sigh>   It really isn't as simple as that!  What I mean is this:  It sounds
like Clancy doesn't really understand much about the requirements to trigger
explosives to detonate an atomic bomb.  

Where do I begin?  The big problem is getting all the explosions to occur at
basically the same instant; ideally, well under a microsecond accuracy.
Well, it turns out that if you just want to trigger a single blasting cap,
only a little current does it.  But the exact time delay of the explosion is
related to the amount of energy applied to the cap.  Put "just enough" power
into it, and it goes in a few hundred milliseconds, but you don't know
EXACTLY when.  Put A LOT MORE into it and the delay is not only shorter, but
also better defined.  While I've never been exposed to specific numbers, in
order to get the explosions REALLY simultaneously normally is thought to
require two types of unusual devices not normally encountered:  High voltage
coaxial capacitors and krytron tubes.  The combination of the two puts a
HUGE amount of energy into each cap, essentially instantaneously, and they
all go off more or less simultaneously.

All this is sophisticated and difficult to deal with.  I've developed a
method that uses materials commonly available in the average medium-size
city, and with the exception of a single blasting cap, are extremely
innocuous to purchase.  I'd be happy to share the information, if there are
no strong objections from the peanut gallery.
