Why doesn't Perry just shut the hell up?  I've got more important things 
to worry about than Perry's ignorant, fetid whining.  Such as that CDA 
thing in the Telecommunications Bill.

Anyone for suing Bill?

through the hurt and the loss and the agony only the night ever hears, is a
waiting soul.  Patient, permanent, abundant, it opens its infinite heart and
asks only one thing of you ... 'Remember who it is you really are.'"
