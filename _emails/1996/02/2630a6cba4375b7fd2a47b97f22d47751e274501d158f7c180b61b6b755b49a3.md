  You may choose not to believe me, but I have been planning to add an option
to disable cookies in the next release for quite some time now.

  Just disabling cookies won't keep sites from tracking your movements.
Many sites require you to register and log in when you access them.
These sites will be able to track your movements through them with or
without cookies.
