I caught the last few seconds of a CNN story on FVs FUD this morning. It 
followed with the RSA selling crypto to China story, where they clearly 
opted for soundbytes... the cut Phil Z's words short when he was talking 
about the benefits of crypto... they asked him something about why crypto 
is good for national security and you hear him say a few economic things 
but then he's cut off (probably before he can mention personal freedom as 
benefitting national security... but that's only a guess).
