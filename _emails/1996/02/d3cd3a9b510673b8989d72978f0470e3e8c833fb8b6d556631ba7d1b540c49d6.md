The differences here are because gondolin.org had serious DNS problems
in January that caused alot of mail to be bounced.  Those problems were
rectified.. hence our traffic flows now...

The latency differences are normal for gondolin because we are not on the
net, we get our mail via UUCP one hop away from the internet itself.  
Since our polling is fairly irregular, our latency will move up and down 
from month to month.
