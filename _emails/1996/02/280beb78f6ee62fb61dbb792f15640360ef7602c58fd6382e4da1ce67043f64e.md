And the biggest secret of the war was that "Fat Man" was the *last* A-bomb
we had or could build for about a year (had taken several *years* to
separate enough fissionable material for the three via two entirely
different processes).

To me this is the great strength of the USA: given a theoretical problem, we
will develop a hundred different solutions, try them all in parallel, and at 
least one will work.
