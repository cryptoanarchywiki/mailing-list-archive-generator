[Hmmm - a crypto-related technical discussion that looks like it's 
coderpunks material?]

The article on Digital Signature Legislation by Brad Biddle <biddle@acusd.edu>
Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, Ctr for Public Interest Law
http://pwa.acusd.edu/~prc
had good coverage of the legal issues related to the Utah digital signature law,
but it touched on one interesting technical point - signature verification
systems that use Certificate Revocation Lists are vulnerable to traffic analysis
because you need to check the CRL at a CA every time you want to verify a
signature from a user certified by that CA.  (There's also denial-of-service
risk.)

For example,  Alice wants to check the signature on Document D, 
which is signed by Bob, whose key is certified by Carol's CA.
Alice may have Bob's public key, or may need to fetch it from somewhere
(this is only a minor traffic analysis risk; she can get it from Bob
or from some public server, or even download all keys from the server.)
If the signature on Document D is good, Alice needs to verify Bob's key.
Alice can check Carol's signature on the key (perhaps fetching Carol's),
but she also needs to know if Bob's key is still good or if it's been revoked.
In a PGP environment, Bob is the only one who can revoke a key, and he's
responsible for shipping out revocations.  In a X.509 environment,
Carol the certifier can revoke her certification of Bob, so Alice has to
check with Carol to be sure she hasn't.  This creates a transaction record.

Biddle's article is concerned about the privacy implications of
Carol knowing about everybody who wants to verify Bob's key, because
the law doesn't address who she can sell the data to.
For cypherpunks, there are more concerns - it's tough to have a 
private conversation if you've got to exchange messages with
your friendly Government Post Office Certification Authority.

Is there a need to build anonymous CRL-checking proxies so people can
check X.509 signatures (e.g. the ones used by Netscape) anonymously?
How much caching can you do?  How would you decide how much to trust it?
The failure modes look different from anonymous remailers, where
a dishonest remailer can save your address, but you can protect yourself
by chaining remailers in serial.  With anonymous CRL proxies,
a dishonest proxy can tell you that "Bob"'s key isn't on Carol's CRL when it is;
to avoid this problem, you need to ask a bunch of proxies in parallel,
which means that any dishonest proxy can reveal your queries.

There's also the denial of service problem - depending on your policies,
and their implementation in software (especially packaged software),
what happens if you don't get a reply saying either yes or no on revocation -
what if Carol or a Man In The Middle decides not to respond to Alice's requests,
or to requests for certifications on Bob's key?  Are you hosed?
