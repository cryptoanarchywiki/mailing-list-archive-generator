That's the killer.  Signatures take a huge amount of CPU time.  Signing
each packet is not going to be cost effective.

However, they could have an authenticated key exchange and then symmetric-
encrypt each TCP/IP connection.  That can perform -- and has the nice
side effect [from the Chinese POV] of depriving the NSA of Chinese civilian
net intelligence.  As long as the key exchange is signed, everything
travelling using that key is authenticated implicitly.
