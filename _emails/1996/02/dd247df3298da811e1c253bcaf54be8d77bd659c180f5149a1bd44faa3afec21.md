Let me see if I understand  this concept correctly.  The remote site would
pre-encrypt the transmitted data, so that when received it could be
decrypted by the requestor according to his (or a temporarily chosen, to
avoid disclosing the actual recipient.) public key, so as to disguise both
the material and perhaps also the actual requestor?

Excellent idea!
