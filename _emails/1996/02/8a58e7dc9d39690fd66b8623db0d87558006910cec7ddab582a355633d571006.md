Obviously you want to criticise without investigation. He who knows all,

It uses one time pads - yes - but true OTPs, not random number generators 
with a key like the POTP people. The mere fact that POTP sells the entire 
package, should tell you something. For long Messages, the basic kernel 
of our system is also a random number generator, but the source key, 5600 bits,
is a true random one time pad generated from a hardware source. 

>From that 5600 bits, a combination of a prime number numbers, picked from 
a large random table, by 512 of the random bits, ie 64 large prime 
numbers, and the other random bits are used to generate the random numbers 
used. This in effect creates a humoungous cycled encryption wheel 
system, with over 10 to the 2300th power possibilities before repeats, 
similar to engima but more like the most secured electronic encryption 
systems used prior to the advent of computers.

You obviously are too informed - since you already know everything, 
perhaps there is nothing more for you to learn so you are right, don't 
waste you time, since you already know, But others, less informed, might

We did refer people to Paul Leyland as you note in your next paragrapgh - 
Unlike PGP, and other RSA systems, DES, and even POTP, the PCX Nvelopes 
system is mathematically unbreakable - if you labor uner the delusion 
that the PGP protects your privacy be our guest. Ask yourself " Why are 
Freeh, Gore and all the others not screaming more than they are about 
RSA systems, DES systems and so forth? They are talking about 
interceting 1 in 100 messages n urban areas, are they doing it 
because they want to waste their time?

Every message is encrypted with a separate Nvelope, and as indicated in 
our site, nver repeated. If the message is less than 5600 bits, it is a 
true random one time pad, from hardware sources - if longer, the one time 
pad becomes a random number generator as partially explained previously.
Each nvelope, hardware one time pad, an ADC LOB system,  is used once and 
only once, the system absolutely precludes reuse.  The $15.00 per moth 
keeps all users supplied with the necessary one time pads, which in the 
case of high volume business users might be a few hundred a day, a stock 
broker, anb accountant, auditor, an attorney or the like.

Obviously you again already know everything, so there is no need to 
try to explain it to you, but others might be interested. As to 
combinatorial explosion, it really ius not as ad as people might think!
A user does not jave to keep all the combinations, only the ones paired 
with, thus in a thousand user system, there is only a need for 999 paired 
Nvelope and Nvelopeners, and some of those will little usage. We keep 10 
Nvelopes/Nvelopeners for each pair, 20 in duplex, and each is 700 bytes.
Thus in a 1000 user system, about 7.2 MB would be required to handle all 
the one taime pads, a lot os space but not unmageable, As Nvelopes are 
used, they are replensihed accordingly to a heuristic algorithm built 
into the system.

That is precisely why PCX Nvelopes is such an extraordinary system. 
That is the beauty of PCX Nvelopes, it lifts that  burden from the 
user, eliminates it entirely. You may have worried about key 
management, but with our system, you will not have to do so in the 
future. The system itself, manages all the OTPs, you do not have to do 
anything but use the system. Key management is the problem with all existing 
systems, but it is no problem at all with the PCX Nvelopes system, as you would 
see if you looked at the system, instead, of talking about something 
when you have no idea at all of what it is about. The first set of keys 
must be sent by a secure source, US mail, FED EX, or whatever, but
thereafter, all updates can be accomodated over Internet.

The combinatorial problem that you referred to previously, would indeed 
generate almost 500,000 pair sets, which we call packets. What is the 
best way to generate those 499,500 sets? 999 We can automatically generate 
them, and all the software that goes with them on 1000 sets of 6 diskettes
each, each of which goes through a separte verification process, and certification 
process, larger systems are delivered in parts, two diskettes 
direct, and the others over internet.

Every onetime pad is subjected to analysis at the bit level, character 
level, couplet level, triplet level, and set level, 5600 bits. As you 
might, but probably do not know, all hardware generation of OTP's are 
irregular, otherwise they are not random. Thus at times, a hardware 
source, such as ADC LOB system, can generate nonrandom data, unless 
this is checked, it can destroyed the integrity of your system. At all 
levels, we check standard deviation, chi Square, Delta IC, and other 
statistical tests. Moreover, we check sets of packet, at the 2, 4, 8, 
16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384 etal. Our 
packets are random, and you can take that to the bank.
