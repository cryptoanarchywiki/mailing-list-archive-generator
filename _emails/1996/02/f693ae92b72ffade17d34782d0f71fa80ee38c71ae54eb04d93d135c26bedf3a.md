I think Lewis McCarthy was very brave to put up the Zundelsite mirror.
(Maybe unwise, too.) It's certainly not something most of the rest of us
are doing on our sites at universities, corporations, and even private
sites.

(Many ISPs will drop a customer who creates any trouble.)

And it's sad that the couple of days of the UMass Zundelsite's effect, even
now being lost in the "spin" coming from the German press about how UMass
forced the removal of the site, will perhaps result in a much lower public
presence by Lewis. (From what I've seen at California universities, the
folks with the long knives will still be trying to "get him."
Unfortunately, with search tools like Alta Vista they can keep tabs on him
semi-automatically and report any further evidence of his racist,
mysogynistic, and anti-democratic views to the Dean of Students.)

(I could add a smiley here, but it's really not very funny.)
