I received a curious mimetic e-mail. The cypherpunks relevance is: will we
or will we not bring down the White House server? :-)

---------- Forwarded message ----------

To whoever may read this,

This is not a typical chain letter, in that by passing it on to as many
people as you can, you are taking part in what may yet become the
world's biggest practical joke. The U.S. Government has recently passed
an act which enforces censorship on the internet. A group of internet
users has now come together to kick back at this oppression, and have a
bit of fun at the same time.

The aim of this exercise is to re-establish the United States as "The
Land of the Free", not a fascist state where freedom of speech and
thought are curtailed. Communist Russia fell as a result of such limits
being placed upon the minds of the general populus.

On receiving this letter, please pass it on to as many friends or
E-mail lists as you can. We predict that if everybody copies the letter
to 5 other addresses, by February 29th 1996, this letter should have
reached in excess of 2 million people. That's when the fun
begins........

On February 29th, please send the message:

Dear Mr. President,

Do you remember this:

And afterwards enclose the pre-typed copy of the Bill of Rights. By
sending the letter on the date above, you will contribute to either one
huge petition for freedom, or else lead to a crash of the White House
server.

Send all letters to:

President@Whitehouse.gov

Remember that solidarity is the key to success
