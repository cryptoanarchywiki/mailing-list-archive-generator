When i was a child we were taught in school that our society was better
than the USSR's 'cause (( wow, the CD i'm playing on my computer just said
"shit"! ) er, ah, excuse me ) children were encouraged to spy on their
parents and turn them in and wouldn't it be horrible if we American
children had to do the same.  As an adult in my twenties i discovered that
children were being encouraged to spy on their parents and turn them in
here in the wonderful USA, in the Holy Name of the War on Drugs (everybody
in my family gets their psychotropic drugs by perscription now so we're all
safe).  It's already too late.

Unless there's another youth revolution maybe?  First the twenties, then
the sixties, next the double noughts?  Dare i hope?
