They laughed at Fulton, but they also laughed at Bozo the Clown.

You, however, aren't funny. You're basically a laetrille salesman.

1) Anything used to drive an algorithm is a KEY. A One Time Pad is not
   something you use as the key for a PSEUDO-random number
   generator. Use the term KEY and not OTP.
2) The term is PSEUDO-random number generator, not random number
   generator. Software cannot produce truly random numbers. It can at
   best take a key for use as a seed in doing so.

There is less than meets the eye. All you guys are doing is running a
PRNG stream cipher from what I can tell. Who knows how bad it is given
the rest of your competence. Your babbling about "wheels" and "prime
numbers" makes one wonder.

> you have been given the opportunity to save all these lives 

If I actually feel you are a threat to anyone, I'll simply let your
local police and prosecutor take care of you. I have better things to
do with my time than bargain with con men.
