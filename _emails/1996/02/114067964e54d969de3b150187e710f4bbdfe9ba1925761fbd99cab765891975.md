Thank you very much for your suggestion. I do not know if you have 
noticed or not,  but we have already done that, with the exception of 
private mail to a very few unspecified individuals, and this letter alone 
among all of the dozens of C'punk and other letters, we have suspended 
replying to the attacks. Please also note, that other than to four 
selected cypher lists, generic, we have made no postings to usenet, or 
listserve groups. We are eager for your cooperation, but there are problems
with complying to some of your requests. Give us a chance to explain that to a 
few of your people, and we will get back with you. Also, please read my 
revised response below,

I believe that the first priority is establish the strength, or lack 
thereof, of the algorithms, Everything else is irrelevant unless that 
can be established one way or the other. Accordingly, I am taking 
the necessary to initiate that effort. Please be patient, for a few days.


Appreciatively yours,


Ralph,   

That applies to even you Perry - the appreciative part that is
