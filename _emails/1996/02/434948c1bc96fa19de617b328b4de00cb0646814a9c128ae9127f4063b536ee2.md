Why oh why am I getting the idea that "cypherpunks" would better be called
"cryptoauthoritarians." From murder-as-political-liberation, to the
universalization of the libertarians "feelings" onto everyone else in the
world, to the mass nuclear bombings of civilians to the mass nuclear
elimination of religions. 
 
My, my. For a group of people so uspet at taxes you certainly have faith in
the ability of private individuals to generate the capital for things like
the Manhattan Project and high-cost nuke delivery systems!

I was wondering if S. Gabb, as a self-declared expert on Islam, if he might
explain the difference between the Sunni and Shi'ite sects, and the
respective size of each? 
 
I am also curious if he could point us to a single written example where he
or anyone else has ever been told the various things that he "doubtless"
will be told? 
 
In short, is this important history posted on cypherpunks, more libertarian
political demagogery,  or another J. Bell-like reference to the
universalization of the libertarian's feelings onto the rest of the world?
