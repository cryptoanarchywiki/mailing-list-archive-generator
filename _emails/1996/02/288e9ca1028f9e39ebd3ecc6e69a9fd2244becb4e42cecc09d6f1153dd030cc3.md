I find less and less disagreeement with your comments - with one major 
exception - for a given message length - say 10 to the 500th power, a 
OTP seeded algorithm, a better term would be to call it an OTP driven 
algorithm,  can produce the exact same effect as an OTP of that length - 
that is, the encrypted text can be any possible message of that length, 
and it is not possible to predict in way what the RNG generated stream
is - 

We can prove that to your or anyone eleses satisfaction - 
It obviously fails to do that somewhat short of infinity, but not short of 
what is  needed to prove system integrity for practical limits. If all 
the paricles in the Universe, 10 to the 80th, were Cray T3Es, and they 
had been calculating since the big bang, according to my rough 
calculations, it would still take over 10 to the 370th power years to 
just generate the message possibilities -for a 10 to the 500th power 
message length possibilities - we assert that if it can do that, and it 
can, it functions like a OTP of that length - and is unbreakable 

We also have a light, but only a slight disagreement, about whether the 
the key is truly symmetrical - we assert that because of the aprticlaur 
data feedback system employed it is not symmetrical, but that is entirely 
beside the point, we believe 10 to the 500th, or whatever should be 
sufficient 

Appreciatively, 

Ralph
