I want to write on the theme posted to the list in the message below where
J. Bell wrote "It is their ACTIONS that I feel violate my rights; that is
what justifies my seeking their deaths, should I choose to do so." 
 
First, one thing that marks the sane adult from the child and the floridly
psychotic adult is the sane adult's knowledge that "feelings" and "facts"
are two different things. 
 
It is one thing to "feel," as J. Bell or all of us might, that our rights
have been violated. 
 
It is another thing to maintain, as J. Bell uniquely appears to do, that
the "feeling" gives him the right to seek another person's death. 
 
This and other posts by J. Bell and other lib'bers lead me to believe that
their claimed interest in human freedom for everyone is little more than a
cover for a set of authoritarian expectations that they can do whatever
they want, free from any control, responsibility, or accountability. 
 
The argued centrality of J. Bell's "feelings" over other people's lives is
something that puts him in the god category. (Thankfully J. Bell is not one
of the dreaded tax collectors or "socialist statists.") 
 
Should J. Bell act on his "feelings" as he seems to think he has the right
to do, he may find that his "right" is little more than another "feeling"
not reflective of reality. 
 
He might also "feel" his rights are violated when a dreaded tax-collecting
socialist-statist called a cop detains him, another dreaded lawyer called a
prosecutor says nasty things about him in a court, a jury says "guilty,"
and another dreaded socialist-statist chowing-down-on-tax-money figure
called a judge says "death." This is also likely to produce an even greater
"feeling" that rights are violated immediately before another figure living
on tax money called an executioner pulls the switch. 
 
Death is sometimes Nature's way of telling us that our "feelings" were out
of sync with reality. 
 
But by then it is too late to do much about it.
