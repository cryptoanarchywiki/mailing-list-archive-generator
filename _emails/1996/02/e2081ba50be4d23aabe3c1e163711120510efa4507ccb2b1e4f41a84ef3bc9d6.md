I'm in the process of running what I guess will be my monthly series of
remailer tests, where I send posts through a given remailer to a nym at c2
and then back through the remailer to me. While it'll be most of a week
before I'm done, some preliminary observations.

- armadillo and hroller are sorely missed.

- remailer@valhalla.phoenix.net is, so I'm told, not a valid address. And I
get a failure to find the host name at wmono@spook.alias.net. Anyone want to
shed light on this?

- performance is noticeably slower throughout. In January I routinely got
messages back in five to ten minutes. Now the shortest round trip is about
fifty minutes. Is the load on the remailers that much higher, or are other
factors at work?
