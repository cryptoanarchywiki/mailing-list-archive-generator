61 Federal Register 6111 (Feb. 16,  1996)
To be codified at 22 CFR parts 123 & 126
Effective today.

Excerpts:


	"After extensive review, the Department of State has decided to 
further amend the regulations to provide for an exemption for the 
temporary export of products for personal use.  The exemption does not 
apply to other circumstances, for example, those in which a person 
contemplates sales, marketing or demonstration....

	... for purposes of this exemption, a product is considered to be 
in the possession of the exporter if the exporter takes normal  
precautions to ensure the security of the product by locking the product 
in a hotel room, safe, or other comparably secure location; and, while in 
transit, the exporter keeps the product in his/her carry-on luggage or 
locked in baggage accompanying the exporter which has been checked with 
the carrier.

	This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States and thus is exploded from the procedures of [ordinary rulemaking].

	However, interested parties are invited to submit risen comments 
to the Department of State, Director, office of Defense trade Controls,  
attention: regulatory change, personal use cryptographic products, Rome 
200, SA-6, Washington, DC 20520-0602.
