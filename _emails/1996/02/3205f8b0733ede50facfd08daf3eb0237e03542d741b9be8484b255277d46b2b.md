Hi.

I was wondering if some of you ever used Nautilus, if it was 
good, if it has a backdoor, etc.

I am not knowledgeable enough to inspect source by myself.

Any comments?

Since the topic was probably discussed extensively, feel free 
to reply to me directly.

Regards to all cyphering punks!

Why, you might wonder, is it that civil servants never look out 
through the window in the morning?  What would they otherwise 
occupy themselves with in the afternoon?
