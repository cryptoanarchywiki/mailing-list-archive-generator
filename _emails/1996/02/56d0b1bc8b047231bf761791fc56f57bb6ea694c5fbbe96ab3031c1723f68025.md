Yes this is all fine and good - but your process does not allow for real time
delivery of goods.  For example:

Somebody wants to buy say micrsoft office from me for electronic delivery
(yes they have a lot of bandwidth :-).  I can authorize a credit card, fun
it by my fraud screen and start shipping in less than 30 seconds.    At this
point the transaction is done.

In the FV model as I understand it I'd have to ship the software and wait for 
an approve/deny/fraud from the user.  If it's anything but approved I'm SOL,
I still have to pay Microsoft for the product but I didn't get paid.

Solve that process flaw and I'll add FV support to software.net.
