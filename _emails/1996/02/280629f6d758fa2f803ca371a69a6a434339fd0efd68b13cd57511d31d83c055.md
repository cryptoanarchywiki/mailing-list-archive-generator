The point of the original article was that those products probably would 
*not* have been sold.  What life would be like in other circumstances is
hard to consider... and rather moot (a friend of mine has an expression
for describing hypotheticals... "What is my grandfather had four arms?").

FSF/GNU and projects like FreeDOS, if they were several years earlier, 
would have made things quite interesting....

A point NOT in the orig. article but hinted at in the subject, though: if 
people cannot *buy* the software because of regs like ITAR, they'll steal 
it.
