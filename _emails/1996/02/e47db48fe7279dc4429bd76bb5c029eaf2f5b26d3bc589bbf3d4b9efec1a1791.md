GTE & Cylink Team On Encryption For ATM
     
Washington, D.C., 31 January 1996 -- During a press
conference last night at Comnet, GTE and Cylink unveiled 
InfoGuard 100, a jointly developed offering billed as the
first encryption system able to work with ATM
(asynchronous transfer mode).  

InfoGuard 100 is meant to provide the security needed to 
induce business and government to use ATM public
networks, said Michael M. Guzelian, GTE's marketing
director for broadband systems, speaking at the press
conference.  

GTE is the number one provider of encryption to the
federal government, while Cylink holds a 70 percent share
of the commercial encryption market, according to Kamy
Kavianian, senior product marketing manager at Cylink for
SecureWAN.  

GTE and Cylink will also jointly market the new ATM 
encryption system. "The deal (for InfoGuard 100) is
mutually exclusive, but we don't know anyone else who can
do it," noted Jeff Callo, Cylink's director of business
development.

InfoGuard consists of two main components, according to
the officials. An ATM adapter from GTE provides ATM
interfaces and cell processing and control functions.  

Cylink's CIDEC-VHS contributes "high-speed data
encryption and decryption," in addition to physical
security and "full automated key functions."  

Kavianian told the journalists that InfoGuard 100 is
based on DES encryption. Users of InfoGuard will foil
"key exhaustion," a method used for breaking encryption
codes, if they "change their codes frequently," Guzelian
added. 

Essentially, CIDEC-VHS has turned out to be "the first 
encryption method fast enough to keep up with ATM,"
Guzelian maintained.  

The agreement between Cylink and GTE represents "an 
excellent example of coopetition," Callo said.
