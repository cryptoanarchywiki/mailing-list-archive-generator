Well, that's the way the net is *now* - but it wasn't always so.  I 
remember the days when the net was composed of a *lot* of point-to-point 
UUCP connections eventually winding up at the backbone.  People could be 
many hops away from the backbone and still have email and news access.  
True, there was no such thing as the web, nor TCP/IP, but we *did* have 
connectivity and communications.  If the Feds pulled the plug on the 
backbone, I can see that there are a lot of people who would drag UUCP 
and pathalias out of the closet, and the UUCP Mapping Project would live 
again (hams have their own backbone are would be not as severely affected 
by the backbone going away).

Not that it wouldn't be hard - but it's doable.
