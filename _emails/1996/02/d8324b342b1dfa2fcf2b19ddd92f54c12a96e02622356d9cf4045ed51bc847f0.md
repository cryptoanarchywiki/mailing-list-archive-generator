The way I like to think of such a scheme is to consider the secret
algorithm itself to be the key, which then drives the cryptosystem
composed of the CPU instruction sequencer on the encrypting machine.
Thus all messages are encrypted with the same key; it should be easy
to see why that isn't secure.
