I think it is, to most people who read my words.

How specific do you want me to be?  I think the examples I gave in my essay 
made it clear what I believe.

"recognized"?  Usta be, "free speech" wasn't "recognized" in many 
jurisdictions.  Are you suggesting that because it wasn't "recognized" that 
it wasn't a right?

Or what, exactly, WERE you suggesting?

Ultimately, your questions are more philosophical than is appropriate for CP.

The answer to that depends dramatically on that someone else's actions, now

Already contradicted above.

I'm afraid your "logic" is a more than a bit faulty.  This reasoning would 
deny anyone the right to self-defense.

Perhaps, but bigotry isn't a crime, nor a violation of someone else's rights.

Voting in an election does not make a citizen a "government employee."

I am not particularly concerned with "this government."  I don't consider 
"this government" to be somehow "special" from a rights standpoint.

On the other hand, exercise of self-defense is not generally considered 
"wrong," either.  I merely am advocating a new type of self-defense, one 
that can be exercised anonymously.  In doing so, it can be a vastly more 
powerful weapon against government tyranny.

So what's your point?

Aha!  So what this means is, anybody who can assemble a sufficiently large 
force (governments, usually) can use the threat of use of that force to keep 
people from resisting, without hope of ever winning.

Classic statist position.

Who says?  Agents of the government punish criminals every day that do 
things to OTHER citizens.  Do you find that to be wrong?  If not, your 
problem is clear:  You have a double-standard about rights.

But the big problem with this position is that the government specializes in 
NON-IMMEDIATE threats.  The cop says "come with me", and if you don't comply 
he pulls a gun.  If you pull one back, he shoots at you.  If you're holed 
up, he brings in reinforcements.  Etc. Etc. Etc.

In effect, you have defined "self-defense" quite carefully in order to ALLOW 
the use of threats and violence by GOVERNMENT people, without the right of 
the citizen to fight back.  As long as those threats and that violence is 
overwhelming and "legally justified," you'll give the citizens no right to 
resist.

Sorry, but I won't play your little tyrannical games.

Apparently you are simply confused.

Justa sec.  In early 1800's England, nominally considered a "civilized 
country" many such crimes carried the death penalty on conviction.

Further, until about the 1960's, rape was a crime which was often punishable 
by death in the US.

Are you as ignorant as you sound, or have you forgotten that YOUR version of 
reality isn't the only one that has ever existed?

Shouldn't the crime victim decide?  After all, it's HIS property, right?   
What makes you think YOU have the right to decide what crimes he should have 
to tolerate, huh?

If employers were to start doing this, they would have a VERY difficult time 
finding new employees to replace their former ones.

Like most statists, you ascribe way too much legitimacy to "the legal system."

So do I.  But we clearly differ.  Hmmmm.    How can this be?

The only reason I didn't delete the previous paragraph is that it makes 
absolutely clear that you believe in YOUR way of doing things, and that 
there cannot be any other way.  Sorry, I disagree.

>> Are you a statist?
>>

That's part of your problem.  It is probably more accurate to say that you 
are a "strict Establishmentarian."  You hide behind the Constitution as if 
it is some sort of "Gift From God."  It isn't.  

As the recent joke goes, "The Constitution may be bad government, but it's 
better than what we have now."

Because it's true.  The current government doesn't follow the Constitution.  
 Some of the people who call themselves "strict Constitutionalists" simply 
want to force a slightly modified version of tyranny on us all.
