Me neither, in general.

A possible exception: I wonder if the checksums on Ethernet or IP
packets use a reasonably strong CRC algorithm. If so, they might be
a decent source of randomness in an environment where you could be
sure the Black Hats couldn't see them. e.g. using only packets from
your own LAN, suitably protected by firewall & good administration.

I'd be more inclined to hash the kernel's internal tables, e.g. process
& file descriptor tables. These should vary quite a lot & if the enemy
can see them, random number quality is the least of your worries.

RFC 1750 is a good reference on this problem.
