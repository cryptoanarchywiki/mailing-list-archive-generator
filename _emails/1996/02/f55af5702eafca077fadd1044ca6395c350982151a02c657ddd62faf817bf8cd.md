  China orders Internet users to register



   BEIJING - In its latest move to control the flow of information, China
   on Wednesday ordered all those who use the Internet and other
   international computer networks to register with the police within 30
   days. China embarked on a broad crackdown on Internet users and other
   sources of information potentially harmful to government interests in
   December.

Oh well.
