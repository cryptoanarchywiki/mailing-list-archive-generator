Mmmmm....  
It seems that there a market demand for a stealth-capable product.  Many peoples here
seems to discuss it.  And for the time being, AFAIK, this type of products are used
by a specific class of peoples, most of which knows what 'stealth' means.

So why is it that they design a program that would not permit the use of a feature 
considered desirable by it's customer base?
