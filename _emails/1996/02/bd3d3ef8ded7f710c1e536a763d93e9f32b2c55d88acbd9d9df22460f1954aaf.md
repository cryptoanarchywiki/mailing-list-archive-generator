DUH!!

Nobody is going to freeze to death if they dress warmly.  That is just a myth
about Antarctica.  It is really a tropical paradise, but THE JEWS don't want
you to know that.  Besides, we will all be going *inside* a VOLCANO!  Even if
somehow Antarctica were freezing cold, we will be plenty warm inside the
volcano which leads to the Aryan Nazi UFO Base at the center of the Earth.

I am not asking Nazis and Holocaust deniers to freeze to death!  I am
inviting them to jump into a volcano, you fool!
