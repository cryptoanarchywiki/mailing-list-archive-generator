Ready the article about the COOKIE.TXT file that Netscape creates.  
Apparently my copy has yet to modify it since it was installed... so 
much for 'hacking' it (I decided to try and leave it write-protected 
for now).

I'm curious if anyone knows which sites use/modify it.

Also wondering why Netscape seems to touch/modify the certification 
key files every time it runs.

Rob.
