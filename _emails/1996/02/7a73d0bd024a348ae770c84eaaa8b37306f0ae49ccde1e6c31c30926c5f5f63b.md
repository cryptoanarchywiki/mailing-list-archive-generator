   Computerworld, February 19, 1996:

   Internet Privacy: How far should federal regulation go?

   "Only The Force of Law Can Deter Pornographers." by Sen.
   Jim Exon

      Don't let opponents of CDA fool you: Nothing in it
      applies to constitutionally protected speech between
      consenting adults. Opponents forsake reason when they
      say they want to protect children from indecency,
      seduction and harassment but maintain that the
      overriding issue is freedom of access to anything by
      anybody. There is too much of the self-serving
      philosophy of the hands-off elite.

   "The 'Net Doesn't Need Thought Police." by Marc Rotenberg

      The U.S. is getting drawn into this craziness because
      religious zealots and their allies in Congress have
      decided they know what is good for us and our children.
      CDA gives federal investigators the right to comb
      through Web sites, newsgroup posts and even private
      electronic mail to find evidence of indecent speech. The
      bill even threatens the right to use privacy
      technologies, such as encryption, because the government
      now will have the right to open private E-mail if it
      suspects the message contains offensive language.
