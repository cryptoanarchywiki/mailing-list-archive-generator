        "Politically incorrect" on this list? What's gotten into you, Dave?
Really! PCism is what all those goddamn Tax-n-Spend Leftist Liberals
do--you know, like the ones in the _Life of Brian_. Folks here would never
engage in _any_ kind of PCism. I'm shocked, shocked...
        Don't you get it? Nation-states are going to collapse Real Soon Now
(after all, their Imminent Death has been Predicted), and the Markets,
guided by an irresistably beckoning Invisible Hand, will Rise Up against
their Tyrannous Masters and be guided out of State Space into
Crypto-Anarchy[T{C}M], the land of milk and honey. And everyone who's
positioned themselves shrewdly--as your friend no doubt has--will prosper.
No problem!
        Tell your friend she has _nothing_ to worry about. In a few months,
she'll look back and laugh.
