In '87, many people received an unsolicited executable from a known source, and
ran it without thinking twice. (If A has B's address in his nickname file, then
B probably knows and trusts A to some extent.) I hope users today know better.

I don't see why stopping a keyboard sniffer is any harder than stopping any
other virus/trojan - and most shops manage to keep them out.
