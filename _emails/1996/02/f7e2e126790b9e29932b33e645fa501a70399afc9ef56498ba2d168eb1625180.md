My single favorite work is by Ross Anderson.  His paper 'Why
Cryptosystems Fail' is excellent, and unknown for reasons that are not
clear to me.  Perhaps its because he diesn't spend all his time
telling the media how wonderful he is. ;)

Next would be Cheswick & Bellovin.  Both are very smart guys, and they
talk a lot about the philosophy of security.  They have a book
'Firewalls and Internet security,' and both have authored many papers.
