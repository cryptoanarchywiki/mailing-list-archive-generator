Even more important, I believe that many (most?) remailers still leave
signatures in by default.  This is extremely dangerous, and inconvenient
too, since some mail programs make you jump through hoops to turn off the
signature feature.  I think it'd be a good idea if ALL remailers omitted
them by default and, if anything, allowed the sender to optionally leave
his or her signature in (though I imagine that'd be a rare request).

I know that there's no sure-fire way to find signatures that aren't
prefixed by, say "--", but that's better than nothing.
