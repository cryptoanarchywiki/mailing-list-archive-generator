DES has been scrutinized for about 20 years.  If there are any trap doors in
the code, then they were built in very well.  DES is weak because of its short
key length, not because of any flaws in its design.  AFAIK, there is no
efficient way to crack 3des (encrypt, decrypt, encrypt).  3des has a 168-bit
key, so brute-force is not efficient.

IDEA and RC4 (with at least 128 bits) seem to be pretty secure.  If you really
don't trust DES or 3DES, IDEA is probably currently the best symmetric
encryption algorithm.
