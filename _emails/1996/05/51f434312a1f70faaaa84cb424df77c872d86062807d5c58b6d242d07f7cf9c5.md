I disagree.  Plenty of laws do not increase freedom, nor leave it at its 
former level.  They decrease freedom. Moreover, they usually do it without 
increasing the level of "security" of the ordinary citizen.

If all the government did was to "protect citizens from predators" the 
government would be dramatically smaller than it is today.

Which "community"?

Does the amount of crime which is demonstrably on the Internet, today, 
actually justify the interest shown by government agencies?  Or, more 
likely, they are merely using whatever crime exists to foist regulations and 
control for their own hidden agenda?

To whatever extent that exists, it will be stopped.

I have different opinions about what is "inevitable."  But I won't get into 
that right now.

Maybe it really _IS_ a "new form of society"?  Maybe that's exactly why the 
government-and-control-types are terrified.  Let it alone a few more years 
and it'll come back and destroy the control they currently have.

Could you be more specific?  And why is the government passing bad laws?  
Could it be that their goal is not more freedom, but is in fact less?  And 
why should you do anything to support the government that's passing those 
bad laws?

I don't think it does.  Cumulatively, we're better off if everybody has 
unbreakable security, because it'll assist the ordinary citizen more than it 
would assist a hypothetical criminal.

But government is not neutral.

And less work for agents of the government to do.  That's what terrorizes them!

Laws being broken does not equate to less freedom.  The presence of those 
laws is what produces less freedom.

I think the ordinary citizen has far more to fear from the government than 
the criminals.  For one thing, it is the actions of the government (by 
passing victimless-crime laws) which actually put a great deal of profit 
into crimes.

Well, then stop sending any.  Or get your head straight on this "freedom 
thing."  People will view you as being dangerous if you keep talking the way 
you have been.
