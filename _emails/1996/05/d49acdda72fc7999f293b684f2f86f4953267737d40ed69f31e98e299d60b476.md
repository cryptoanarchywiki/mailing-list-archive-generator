In their paper (Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public Safety in
the Global Information Infrastructure), McConnell and Appel state that they
are willing to allow 80 bit GAKed hardware to be exported, but only 64 bit
software.  They state the reason for this difference is because it is
harder to hack the hardware to defeat the GAK.

Now we all know that, should this proposal be adopted, the four horsemen
will use some non-GAKed cypher system, e.g. PGP, inside the GAKed envelope.

When privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy.
