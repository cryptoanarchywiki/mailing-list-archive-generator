I stand behind my original post and the analysis in it. 
 
I am amused at the tremendous attempts by people with certain political
affinities to bail out Weaver by a series of arguments based either on
profound ignorance of political realities or with their own private
dictionaries. 
 
The whole argument of racism vs. white separatism vs. white suppremicist
seems more to come from people who argue whether someone is a Baptist or a
Christian or a Southern Baptist or a Protestant. (In mathematical set
theory one would trace the fallacy in thinking to the false idea that any
given element of a set cannot be the element of more than one set. Thus, if
(X is a member of Y) it cannot also be a member of Z.) 
 
I understand that James D. is not accusing me of being a "child molester"
but merely using it as a reductio ad adsurdem argument. 
 
Let me continue in this vein. 
 
The issue of  child molestation was dragged in and had no relevance on the
immediate political isues of Weaver et al. 
 
But imagine people are arguing about the deep fundamental differnces
between someone who is a "child molester" vs. a "pedophile" vs. a "boy
lover."
