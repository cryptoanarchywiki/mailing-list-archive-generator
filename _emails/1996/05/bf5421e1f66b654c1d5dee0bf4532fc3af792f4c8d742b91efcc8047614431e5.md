Qualitatively, perhaps.  But quantitatively, no.  I think that blame for any 
given situation or government behavior will be distributed in a reasonably 
fair fashion, with those directly responsible for abuse becoming "dead meat" 
while those on the periphery only marginal targets.  Your generous 
interpretation of their guilt is certainly not binding on me.   And in any 
case the fact that the people involved will usually be able to resign will 
be a logical "out."

I agree.  Which is why I'd much prefer a method to preferentially target a 
relatively smaller number of people, and I've invented (discovered?) just 
such a system.  Why not let it work?

Why not kill those Iranian leaders, using AP?  And if you're afraid they'll 
retaliate against "our" leaders, I see nothing wrong with that, either.  
It's the leaders who maintain the dispute.

> Your methods will be used for ends you do not agree with. 

Hey, I realized that long ago!  But I'm not under any illusion that this 
system can be molded to conform to my wishes alone:  If I could, I'd become 
a dictator and the cycle of tyranny would continue.

"Very hard"?  If they'd tried "very hard" they would have succeeded.  No, 
the various leadership groups controlling different countries have far more 
in common with each other than with the ordinary citizens.  They all are 
perfectly aware that if a precedent is established that killing the 
leadership is to be used to solve a dispute, eventually they'll all be dead. 
 Thus, they reject this solution like the plague.  The government only 
pretends to not be able to succeed at this task in order to assuage the 
natural desires of the public.

They are misled, of course.

The only reason there might be "many others waiting to take his place" is 
that assassination is actually a rare event.  Make it easily accomplished, 
and who would want to take any politician's place?

Unless I capture the public's imagination, and they realize what kind of 
improvements it promises.  Or, at least they recognize that opposition by 
those in government is entirely self-serving.

It doesn't take a great deal of perception to see this.  The media and the 
government are dependent on each other:  The media needs access to news, the 
government needs a pliable sounding board.  Chomsky has gotten smart on this 
subject, a little bit late in my estimation.  Chomsky's main advantage is 
that he's been a public figure for years, which means when HE spouts this 
stuff it's considered news.  When we talk about it, it's ignored.

It isn't that it "has to" be violent.  Resignation is always an option.  
Problem is, they don't want to give up their positions of power.

That depends entirely on what your definition of instigating violence really 
is.  I happen to believe that the act of collecting taxes, involuntarily, IS 
the "instigation of violence" even if the victim gives up his assets without 
a fight, if there is the prospect of eventual violence should he refuse to 
cooperate.  Until you see this, you'll have a warped view of the propriety 
of AP, not to mention the libertarian non-initiation of force  principle.
