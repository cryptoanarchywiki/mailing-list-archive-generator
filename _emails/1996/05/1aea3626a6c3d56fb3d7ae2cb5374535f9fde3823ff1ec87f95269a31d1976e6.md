These off-shore data havens, possibly in Anguilla, possibly elsewhere, have
long been a motivation for crypto anarchy.

"Illegal to collect in the U.S." is the operative phrase.

(P.S. Cf. the sections in my Cyphernomicon for a discussion of how the main
U.S. credit-collecting agencies (TRW Credit, Transunion, and Equifax) have
various cozy relationships with the U.S. government and intelligence
agencies. Many of the laws about collection of data are ignored when
needed. Ask the credit agencies why and how they willingly participate in
the falsification of credit histories, and even the creation of credit
histories out of thin air.)
