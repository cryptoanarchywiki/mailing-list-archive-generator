I think you could add Estonia to the list. Although I have not discussed
this with local ISP's, I think running a remailer or nymserver from a Unix
shell account should not be such a big problem. The Internet connection to
the rest of the world is quite good and there are no government
regulations.

MicroLink OnLine (info@online.ee, http://www.online.ee/) has a PPP/Unix
shell account (on Sun Sparc) with 1MB disk space for 170 USD a year or 15
USD a month.  Just pay in advance, they have an on-line registration. 

Teleport (info@teleport.ee, http://www.teleport.ee/) is another company,
which has PPP/Unix (on Linux) with 1 MB for 8 USD a month or 96 MB a year.
