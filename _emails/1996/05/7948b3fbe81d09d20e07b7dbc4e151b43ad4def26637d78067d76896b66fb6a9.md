That's just lack of creativity. Try this:

Get a friend of yours to setup a consulting company and
hire you (and maybe a few more people who pay too much
taxes,acting like a mixmaster). The company pays you salary
to cover your cost of living. Anything above that, i.e.
money that you would otherwise save, is paid to an offshore
company as license fees (or something, this is the creative
part).

This is really legal as long as you don't receive any money
from offshore without paying the taxes. If you borrow the
money back it gets a little fuzzy.

Thousands of people in upper middle class are doing exactly
this, so the mixmaster is really in place already. The local
mix is just an extra precaution for deniability (it was my
friends company, I had no idea what he was up to!).

For the friend to accept the (very minor) risk of jail,
he/she should probably be much poorer than you, or have
a *lot* of clients, to make his pay outweight the risk.

By the way, are there any PGP encrypted mailing lists for
discussing serious tax fraud?
