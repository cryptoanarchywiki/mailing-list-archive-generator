On the whole, I like it. The problem comes when someone is trying
communicate anonymously with some other person who doesn't have a clue about
the whole thing. It would be neat to have soem way of generating a message
to the effect "Someone is trying to communicate anonymously with you. [short
explanation of good and bad uses of anonymity] If you would like to receive
this message, [instructions about permitting]"

Unfortunately, I don't know how one could separate those messages from all
the rest of the traffic.
