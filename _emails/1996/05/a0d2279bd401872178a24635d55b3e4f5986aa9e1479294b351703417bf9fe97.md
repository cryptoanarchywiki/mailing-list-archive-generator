It's better than nothing.  And besides, the more remailers there are, the
more difficult it is to do traffic analysis on remailer traffic.  Actually,
its the more remailers people chain messages through, but there are software
packages that can do this easily.  The more remailers there are, the longer
remailer chains have the possibility of becoming.
