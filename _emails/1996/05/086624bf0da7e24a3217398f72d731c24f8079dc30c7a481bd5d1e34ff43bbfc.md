As far as I can tell, Perry's requirements are that *no* uncertified "code" 
should be running anywhere inside the firewall, whether it be a java 
applet or a game disk brought in by a temp in settlements.

One application of Solid Oak could be used to help out here; many applets 
are not custom written for a single page, but are instead just instances 
of fairly standard code. If this code is signed for by the software house 
that produced the applet, then the code can be accepted or rejected based 
on a approved vendors list.  This works for most medium security applications

There are situations where this is not enough; normally these 
organisations will have there own security divisions capable of doing 
there own evaluations. In these cases, the local security division could 
sign the code, and the application on the desk be configured to only run 
applets authenticated by the local security team.
