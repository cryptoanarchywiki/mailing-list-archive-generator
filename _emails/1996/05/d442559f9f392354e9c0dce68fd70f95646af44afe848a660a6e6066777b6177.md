So what, pray tell, is the IRS going to do?  Impose a "we see no income"
fine and seize property?

They can audit, but audits are winable too.  An offshore company simply
keeps dropping cash into the local business.  That's not a crime.  The
local business is losing money like crazy, but who is to say they are
defrauding per se?  Bad business judgment is hardly tax fraud, and how do
you know (with a properly blinded ownership) that the assets that are
pouring into this company with all these expenses are taxible in the U.S.
in the first place?
