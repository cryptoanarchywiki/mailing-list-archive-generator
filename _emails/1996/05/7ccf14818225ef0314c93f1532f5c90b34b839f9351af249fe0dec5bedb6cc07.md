You don't have to disagree with me here.  I've said this all along.  It
can be expensive and difficult to set up a system to reduce tax offshore.
But the expense is mostly in setup costs and very front ended.  Once a
structure is in place, it's not that hard to continue to benefit.

I have to strongly disagree here.  But now you're talking about evasion,
not avoidance.  It's trivial to hide stock ownership from the IRS.  This
is perhaps one of the easiest things one can do.  Consulting fees?  These
too can be concealed.  It takes more work, but its possible.

Were you to liquidate and move out of the country and renounce
citizenship, and consult from abroad, and if you did this properly with
your t's crossed, you could very easily and legally avoid (not evade) U.S.
tax.  The question is whether this is an option for you or not for other
practical reasons.

The IRS almost never settles like this.  Not in my experience anyhow,
unless they have a feeling that an aggressive auditor was over zealous
with your returns (and this should have been caught before you get to the
settlement phase in any event).

> Call me a skeptic.

You're a skeptic, but a reasonable skeptic.

You have an idea about what you're willing to spend, and what your willing
to "pay."  Your decision seems to be (quite logically) based on those
factors.

I'll not claim its easy, and I know too little about your financial
situation to make specific recommendations.  (This is not, by the way, an
invitation for discloseure of anyone's financial dealings).  I
will say it's possible, and your mileage will depend on several factors.
How much you're willing to spend.  What you're willing to risk.  How risky
you want to get. etc. etc.  The nature of some people's business
makes it costly, others, who have mostly passive income, have an
easier time of it.

Here I'm not so sure I agree.  Several of us are working on making it
happen, soon.

Expatriate, have your expatriation pass the "Furstenburg" test and be
certified as being made for non-tax avoidance reasons, and you will pay
$0.00 in capital gains when you liquidate.

Should you be unable to pass the "Furstenburg" test, you can still enjoy
your dividens for 10 years before liquidating tax free.

If you don't want to wait 10 years, you can do a installment sale of your
stock via an exchange mechanism, tax free.

All 100% legal, until the Clinton "Death on expatriation" tax reform bill
passes and is signed.

I don't know what Mr. Sandfort suggested exactly, but I suspect he was
talking about an exchange of stock for debt instruments.  In some cases
such an exchange can be a non-realization event.  A form of this is one
way IPO execs still get cash from their options without being able to
exercise them and thus avoid the time restrictions on sale of stock and
condequently, often the realization of such sale.  I have to brush up on
my U.S. tax to tell you exactly when this works.  Let me know if anyone is
interested.

Coral Atolls are not the only jurisdictions you can live in and enjoy low
or no tax.  Consider Monoco, Liechtenstein and Panama for starters.

Imprisonment is another matter.  None of my clients have ever gone to
prison, only one has ever been audited.  (Issue was recommended for 
referal then dropped for lack of evidence)  Then again, I don't have as
many clients now as I once did.

Is it easy to minimize taxation?  No.  The United States has intentionally
made it so.  Is it impossible?  No.  Never will be.

Part of the problem is inertia.  There is a (not unreasonable) view that
taxes to the extent that the U.S. imposes them are a fact of life and that
no efforts can mitigate them which will not cost more to implement than
will be saved.  The truth of this view varies in degree with each
taxpayer.

As to the future, I predict powerful tax evasion options at the click of a
WWW button in 2-3 years.  Not that I would ever advise anyone to break
U.S. law.
