	Surely you don't conclude from the fact that _you_ think I'm
stretching it that most others would think so as well... My point wasn't
that the committee was "right" in any elegant sense but, rather, that their
misperceptions are almost certainly indicative of the kinds of
misperceptions that will propagate far and wide--and be effective--as
public-key encryption becomes more common. Humanity managed to get by for
centuries laboring under the delusion that cheese produces worms: the fact
that they were wrong doesn't make those centuries of fact go away.
