	Yes, even the CC types can get some things right. Take a look at the
opposition to the Anti-Terrorism bill, for instance. Quite a few militia
organizations are Christian fundamentalist in orientation (unfortunately); they
were in alliance with the ACLU in opposing it.
	However, the objection to banning address lists of interference with
private business still stands, so long as the addresses are not gotten from
governmental or quasi-governmental (e.g., allowed/regulated monopoly/ogliopoly)
sources.
