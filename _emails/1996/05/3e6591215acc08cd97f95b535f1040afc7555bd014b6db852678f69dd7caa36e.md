Indeed.

Plus, should one "just make a number up," odds are good that it "won't
compute," that is, that it will either collide with an existing number (and
identity, and reported income) or that it will fail the checksum/allocation
tests.

(That is, not all xxx-yy-zzzz numbers are valid SS numbers. See Chris
Hibbert's "Structure of Social Security Numbers" FAQ, at
http://snyside.sunnyside.com/cpsr/privacy/ssn/oldSSN/ssn.structure.html
for details.)

The IRS imposes penalties for faking SS numbers. (Not to mention the
punishment meted out by the Sturmgruppenfuhrers of the SS!)

A simple transposition of two digits may not get you zapped, but a
large-scale transposition or outright falsification will. If and when they
catch up with you.

I'm all for avoiding taxes, but this is not a cost-effective way to do it.
