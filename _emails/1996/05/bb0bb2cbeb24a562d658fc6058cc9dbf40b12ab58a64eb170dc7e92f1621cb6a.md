The same is also true for cpunk and penet-style remailers that do not use
encryption.  You always have to trust remailer operators regardless of whether
encryption is used or not.  The situation will become much better when there
is some way to chain proxies and encrypt to each individual proxy.  If the
operator of a proxy is more trustworthy than the operators of any sites you
visit using the proxy, then you have nothing to lose.
