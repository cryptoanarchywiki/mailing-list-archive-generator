Do tell.  How would someone, just for instance, who is considering
leaving a "permanent" job for the higher compensation available to
contractors and consultants be able to structure a business in such a
way as to benefit from these techniques?  If we assume a rate of
between $60/hour and $125/hour (typical in Boston, New York, and the
Silicon Valley), how much can one save?  How much effort and money is
required?  How much risk is involved?

There are many books on the shelves claiming to show how to avoid
taxes using these techniques.  Most of them have the smell of
"dangerous crackpot" about them.  Can you recommend any in particular?

If this is too far off topic for cypherpunks I'd be interested in
learning of a more appropriate forum.
