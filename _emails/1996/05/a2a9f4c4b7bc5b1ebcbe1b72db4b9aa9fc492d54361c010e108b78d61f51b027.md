One is trying to remove liability for a tort, the other is instructing
the purchaser on the conditions of use.

While a ski-lift ticket could be considered a "license" to use the
property, selling an actual intellectual property ITEM makes the limiting
terms of its purchase a bit easier for a court to stomach.  Telling a
licensee that if he gets hurt its too bad, and telling one that he cannot
call a function or copy the work are fairly distinct in this way.

In the practical world, the plaintiff who is trying to enforce a software
licensing agreement is much better off than a defendant trying to resist
liability for a tort.

It's a question of appearances which can get lost in the nuances of
definition and technicality.

That depends.  If there was reason to believe, for instance, that the
message might indeed be four-horseman type (as a plaintiff's attorney I
would jump all over any messages which came from "soandso@PLO.com" or
somesuch) then negligence becomes an issue regardless.  Perhaps the host
was the site from which other nastiness was mailed?  Anything that could
be shown to put the operator on effective, implied, or constructive notice
that something was amiss.

Remember, technical savvy judges are few and far between.  Technical savvy
juries are nearly non-entitites.  My concept of what is or is not
suspicious when it comes to such things is going to be much more
sophisticated than that of a judge or jury in most if not all cases.

This is an important point.

The truth of the matter is entirely pointless in the U.S. Judicial system.
The APPEARANCE of the matter is key.

'punks seem to forget this in all their discussion of what a court might
do because, simply put, they know more than 99% of the population about
the subject.

I would simply put a notice of where complaints can be directed to, and
publish a stated (and carefully worded) policy for addressing abuses.

This will go a LONG way to insulating remailer operators.

"Your honor, my client has made every effort to filter the legitimate
users of his system from the illegitimate.  He has a stated policy
regarding complaints and investigates them to the full extent of his
ability in every case in which a complaint is filed.  Even as this is so,
he can no more completely assure that harassing messages will never slip
through than can the U.S. post office protect every citizen from mail
bombings."

Or some such.  If you can say this in court and back it up, you're in
better shape.
