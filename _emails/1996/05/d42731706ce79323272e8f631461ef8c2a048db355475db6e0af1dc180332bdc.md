When the NSA ordered large workstations from a supplier they had the
supplier leave them at a motel parking lot in Maryland.

Many such stories exist in the intelligence community.

That's standard procedure for some appropriations where the instalation
location is secret and the vendor is untrusted or marginally trusted.

If you have two trusted parties, and the transaction is secret then unless
you have a mole or something else, who is going to say the item was sold?
Leave semi-trailer in truck stop parking lot, second cab comes and picks
it up and drives away.  This too hard to comprehend?

No.  I have an anonymous transaction with you.  You feel I cheated you.
Who are you going to direct the massive jaugernaut of the AP machine
against?  Eh?
