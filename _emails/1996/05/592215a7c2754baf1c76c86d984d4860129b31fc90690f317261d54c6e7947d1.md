The only reason that Keith could post NOTS 34 at all was because it had
previously been posted to a.r.s anonymously. Prior to that, no-one outside
of the Church had a copy of any NOTS materials(or so the Church says).

Grady Ward got sued by the Church just because he _asked_ for a NOTS pack to
be sent to him. The Church will do everything within its not inconsiderable
power to prevent NOTS material being disseminated on the Internet - up to
and including destroying the anonymous remailer network.
