Actually, I once lapsed and *did* say the "h" word about the network layer
around here about 6 months ago, and I got slapped severely around the head
and sholders, by Gilmore, if memory serves.

Knowing enough not to argue with my elders and betters, :-), I immediately
recanted and now assert geodecity(!) until proven otherwise.

If I remember right, Gilmore said something about a monstorous
preponderence of packet traffic still being handled by relatively beensy
direct lines...

Cheers,
