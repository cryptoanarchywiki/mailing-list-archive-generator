Where does the company get the funds to pay you?

As the source of personal services income is the site of the preformance
of services, your salary will be taxible at U.S. rates.  Licensing fees
hoarded into an offshore holding company will be taxed yearly regardless
of their distribution as dividens (if the money is invested as equity)
and the principal taxed on repayment if characterized as debt.  It will
not, of course be legally yours if deposited without either
classification.

Except that it is going to cause your friend who set it up to incur the
penalities that surround classification of his company as a Foreign
Personal Holding Company.  If he is a U.S. citizen, he can deduct the
costs of sending you salary, but that means he still has to pay about 60%
of what goes out.  (Revisit the double taxation issue).

What pay?  I don't get it.  Where does this friend gets his money?

If such a list existed, would we tell an anonymous poster/fed?

If your above scheme is intended merely to conceal funds it is a fairly
poor example as it depends on the secrecy of each and every 'employee' of
the company.
