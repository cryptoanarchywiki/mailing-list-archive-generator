>EU TAKES A CLOSER LOOK AT THE INTERNET

	We've heard a lot on the German one. What's the Great Britain one look

>CANADIAN SATELLITES TARGETED
>The race into space with direct broadcast satellite TV has created a

>(Toronto Financial Post 4 May 96 p1)

	Of course they're going to try to control it.
