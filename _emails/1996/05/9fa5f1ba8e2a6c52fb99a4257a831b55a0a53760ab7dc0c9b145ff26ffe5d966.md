Several months ago I filed a set of export applications requesting 
permission to export cryptographic software from Canada. I learned a 
few things from these applications, my conversations with people at 
Export Controls, and my own careful reading of Canada's export laws.

    There are a few countries to which you may not export anything,
    without a permit.

    You need a permit to export most cryptographic software.

    It is legal to export Canadian software, even cryptographic 
    software, which has no restrictions on distribution (this must be 
    explicitly stated, not just implied by being available for public 
    FTP). No paperwork needs to be filled out.

    Cryptographic software of U.S. origin may be exported, but you 
    need to file paperwork.

    Cryptographic software from other countries may be exported without 
    any paperwork.

    These are the Canadian rules. Canada interprets and enforces the 
    U.S. export laws when they think it is necessary. While the U.S. 
    government has sometimes objected to a Canadian interpretation, no 
    Canadian exporter, acting with Canadian permission, has been charged 
    by the U.S. government.


The export of cryptographic software from Canada is under review right 
now. All of this could change at any time.

A complete explanation of the process, and results is available from the 
Electronic Frontier Canada's web site at:
