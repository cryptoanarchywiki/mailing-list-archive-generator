                                  DESCRIPTION
                                       
   This library contains a suite of cryptographic classes for Java. All
   of the classes have been implemented in native code for performance
   reasons, and have been tested on Windows 95, Windows NT and Solaris.

   Download in source or binary form at http://www.systemics.com/software/

   
                                   FEATURES
                                       
   All of the following have been implemented using native methods:
     * BigInteger class (based on code from Eric Young).
       This class implements arbitrary length integers and some
       associated mathematical functions.
     * DES class (based on code from Eric Young)
     * IDEA class
     * MD5 class (based on code from RSA Data Security, Inc.)
     * SHA class (based on code from NIST and Peter C. Gutmann)

       
                                   COPYRIGHT

   owned by) the following:
     * Peter C. Gutmann
     * NIST
     * RSA Data Security, Inc.
     * Systemics Ltd <http://www.systemics.com/>
     * Eric Young <eay@mincom.oz.au>
       
   

   Also planned for release:

     * Cryptographic library for Java
     * PGP library for Java
