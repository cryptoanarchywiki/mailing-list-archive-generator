The goal, obviously, is to make the cost of collection of $1 in taxes 
sufficiently expensive  so that they can't do it economically.  But let me 
draw an analogy:  The easiest form of shooting is paper target practice:  
The target is fixed.  More difficult is trap and skeet, where the target 
moves.  More difficult still is hunting, where the target (animals) is at 
least somewhat intelligent and usually very mobile, as well as camouflaged.  
This is analogous to encryption.  But the most difficult form of shooting is 
war, in which the "target" can shoot back.

If a computer model could be constructed of it, I think you'd find that the 
most effective way to avoid taxation is to invest money to target those 
doing the collection.  In fact, I'll go so far as to say that it would 
probably cost less than 10 cents to prevent the collection of $1 worth of 
tax, and probably closer to a penny.  Any analysis of the destruction of the 
state is incomplete without considering such a scenario.
