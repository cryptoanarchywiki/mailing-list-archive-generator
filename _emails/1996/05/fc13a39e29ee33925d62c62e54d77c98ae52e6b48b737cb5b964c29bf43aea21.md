Apologies for replying to a reposted article; I wasn't subscribed when
the (very interesting!) open books protocol was originall proposed.

Yes, if the bank manufactures a fake transaction to a customer's
account, I see that the customer can discover the discrepancy & step
forward to identify the bank.

But what if the bank manufactures a fake account, without a real
customer, and fakes a transfer into that account, pocketing the
money that should have gone into that account?  There is no real
customer corresponding to that account to check up on the open
books, so it seems to me like a bank employee can embezzle money
undetectably this way.

Did I miss an important part of the protocol, or does some extra
mechanism need to be added to counter this threat?
