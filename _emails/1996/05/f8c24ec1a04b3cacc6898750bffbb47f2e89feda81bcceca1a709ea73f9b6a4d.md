	Fascinating. I would think the IRS would care - that's how they know
how to tax interest. They don't put any pressure on the banks to get the right
one? I seem to recall showing the bank a driver's license or some such with
a SSN on it the last time I opened an interest-bearing account.
	As I recall, government branches are authorized to get SSNs - if they
show you the privacy act paperwork. If they forget, I would suppose that
lying to them is perfectly permissible. What about if they do?
