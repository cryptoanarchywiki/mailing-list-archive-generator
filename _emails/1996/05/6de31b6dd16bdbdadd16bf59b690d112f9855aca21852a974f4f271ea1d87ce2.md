                      Pari

                    talk by

                   Carl Hansen

       Monday, June 10 from 7:30 pm to 9 pm

        BMUG, 2055 Center Street, Berkeley

Carl will give an introductory talk on Pari, software that supports
arbitrary precision arithmetic and includes many function for doing
number theory.  He will compare it to other math software and show
the special features of this program, including how Pari can be used
as a cryptographers workbench.

This presentation will be at the BMUG office at 2055 Center Street
in Berkeley.  The office is near the north west corner of Center Street
and Shattuck Ave. which is half a block from the Berkeley BART station.

Driving directions:
        Take the University exit off 80.
        Head east on University toward the UC Berkeley campus.
        Turn right at Shattuck (McDonalds will be at the corner.)
        Go 2 blocks.
        Turn right on Center and look for parking.
        I recommend the parking garage on the left, as the one on
                the right may close at 8 pm.
