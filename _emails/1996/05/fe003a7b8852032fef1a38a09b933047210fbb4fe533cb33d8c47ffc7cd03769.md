	There are, however, some possible difficulties with this.
	A. If the Feds know about some scheme, they are more likely to be able
to thwart it. The extent to which this is true, of course, depends on the
method(s) being used.
	B. Sting operations.

	These are arguments for the list being closed in format, with some
form of security check. The major problem with this is that the security check 
will break the anonymnity of participants... you may not want to trust whoever
is doing the checking, even if they're public (as they should be for this).
