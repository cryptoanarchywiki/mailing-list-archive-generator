	One wonders what their hashing method would be. If it's not very
cryptographically secure, one could (via selection of image file names,
comments, etcetera) cause it to be the same hash for a very different set of
images. (A Fun With Animals page from riding lesson photos to bestiality, for
instance.)

	And how are you defining "misuse"? If the system is not good, then
rating something differently than how the system says it should be is using it
properly, not improperly.
