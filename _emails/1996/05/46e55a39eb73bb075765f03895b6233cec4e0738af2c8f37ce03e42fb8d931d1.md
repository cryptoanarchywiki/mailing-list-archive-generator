	Might I suggest setting up another computer with Java enabled, and
_without_ the critical applications? Somehow, I think they can afford an
extra computer for each desk - it wouldn't have to be a high-capability one.
That would also cure having to have Netscape and other high-network-access
programs on the same computers as the critical applications. (Of course, some
of the critical applications may also need to access the Internet... but they
probably wouldn't need http capability.)
	Of course, feel free to tell me that I don't know what I'm talking
about.
	-Allen
