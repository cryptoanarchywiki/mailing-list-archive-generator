Krazy glue _will_ glue fingers, if applied properly. I proved this to a
fellow sailor in 1976 by gluing his thumb and forefinger around a JP-5 vent
pipe aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. 

Some folks might want to try liquid latex, contact adhesive, silicon sealers
(RTV), or similar products. Soft, flexible, relatively convenient when
applied, and can be 'layered' to the desired thickness. Liquid latex can
usually be found in hobby/craft stores.
