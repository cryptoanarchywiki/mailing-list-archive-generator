    THe IRS is very aggressive about making sure that employment taxes are
paid. If your boss has the right to tell you _how_ to do your work, he is
your boss, not your consulting client. It doesn't matter, whether your
boss choses to exercise his supervisory powers or not. If he has the
_right_ to do so - you are an employee. This has been wrung out in the
courts many times.
