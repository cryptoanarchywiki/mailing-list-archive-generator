	I am not quite certain if the model of
[content provider]-[ISP]-[Phones]-[ISP]-[ISP]-[user] is going to work much
longer. That routes the material through quite a few too many bottlenecks,
among them the phone lines. I could reasonably easily sign up with two ISPs
and start myself as a router (with a good computer and the right software),
from what I know of the subject; with ecash routing of messages, this might
get quite common (and profitable).
	When you've got a few large organizations doing the routing, what
you've said is _probably_ correct. When you've got a lot of people doing it
out of their garages, then it isn't.
