It's not just marketing, it's a fact of life. 16 bit operating systems are not
supported any more. Just as 8 bit OSes haven't been supported for quite
a while either. There will come a day when 64 bits are considered the
minimum for useful software (large database systems are already there).

You just can't stick with 16 bits forever, MS-free or not. Face it.
