Definitely - aside from severe dangers like automated theft or incorrect output,
even software that takes a PC down for 5 minutes during the trading day
every once in a while can cost big money to a brokerage firm.

Netscape now lets you turn off Java and Javascript.  An ideal would be to
support running applications signed by your choice of application-certifiers,
