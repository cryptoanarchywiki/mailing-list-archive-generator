Q.E.D.


Actually, I think Duncan's "high school + marriage + any job" point is a
bit simplistic, and I'm surprised about the ".02%" estimate. As someone
else noted, there are a lot of folks in the rural South, Appalachia, and
other places, who graduated from high school, are still married, and have
some sort of job, and yet who make $6-8 an hour or less.

I think more is needed. I would have added "savings/investment" and "hard work."

Those who can force themselves to set money aside for investment get the
compounded returns later on. And of course hard work--including taking a
second job, having the extended family work, etc.--is also key.

(Many immigrant Asians arrive penniless in the U.S., then get help from
immigrant Asian who arrived earlier, live in crowded houses and apartments,
have 4-6 wage-earners in a household, save as much as they can, and then
open a small business. Success is almost inevitable. Hence the cycle
continues. This tradition of the various Asian subcultures is almost
completely lacking in certain other subcultures in America. More's the
pity.)
