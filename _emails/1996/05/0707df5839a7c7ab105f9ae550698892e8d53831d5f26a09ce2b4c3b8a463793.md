Nah, what happened to Escobar was a business falling-out.  His business partners, the thugs in the US and Colombian governments, provided the illegality of drugs, a necessary element in keeping profits up.  Escobar provided the drug trafficking, a necessary element in keeping thug...er...police employment high.  It was a great system; worked for years and is still generally operational.  Escobar must have done something to upset the arrangement, like refusing to pay off his handlers or maybe going out of business, etc.
