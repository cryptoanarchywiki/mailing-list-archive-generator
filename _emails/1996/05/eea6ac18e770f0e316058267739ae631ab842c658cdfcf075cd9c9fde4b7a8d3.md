	The instructions in question, at
http://www.safesurf.com/cyberangels/#look, are for their "volunteers" to report
- including to both the page's ISP and to government - any page with sexual
content that doesn't have a PICS such that it can be censored. In other words,
they want to try to kick off systems - including potentially via legal action
such as nonsense like "corrupting a minor" or whatever - any pages that don't
set themselves up to be censored. That would include by government such as
China, as well as by fundamentalist parents.
	Given their approval of Detweiler, you're making it more and more
likely that you're him....
