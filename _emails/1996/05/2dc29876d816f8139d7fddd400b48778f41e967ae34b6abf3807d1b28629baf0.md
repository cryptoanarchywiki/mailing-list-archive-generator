Hmmm... this is getting fun.  Now I have something to take out my
frustration at 3Com shipping me a broken 100baseTX hub...

I guess that farm subsidies, school lunches and the infamous "government
cheese" are all figments of our imagination...

Are you aware of the fact that it is next to impossible to disconnect
gas/electricity for poor customers during the winter in these areas?
Have you ever wondered why the services rep asks you questions regarding
your income when you sign up for phone or electrical/gas services?

Gee, I seem to remember when the only phone system of any consequence
in the US was the Bell System.  A heavily regulated monopoly with the
government overseeing almost all aspects of the services offered.

Can FedEx send a 1 oz. letter to anywhere in the world for 32 cents?  A
classic example of cherry-picking among private companies.

A private physician who must adhere to governement standards and who could
not practice medicine without the permission of the government?  [okay, you
sort of have a point on this one but you were really shooting blanks on
the other issues.]

Yes, but you should give better examples.  This is not an issue which is
easily argued using the "sound bites" you are trying to give us.
