Thanks to prompt faxing by Ed Roback of NIST, we have transcribed and sent
to Pat Farrell the Draft Key Escrow Paper entitled "Enabling Privacy,
Commerce, Security and Public Safety in the Global Information
Infrastructure," 25 pages (50 kb). Pat will shortly announce its
availability on his Web site. 
 
 
Much easier to grab it from Pat, but for anyone without Web access, we'll
E-mail it. Send a blank message to jya@pipeline.com with the subject

Here's the cover letter of the report:

MEMORANDUM FOR INTERESTED PARTIES 
 
SUBJECT:  Draft Paper, "Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security 
          and Public Safety in the Global Information 
          Infrastructure" 
 
FROM:     Bruce W. McConnell [Initials] 
          Edward J. Appel [Initials] 
          Co-Chairs, Interagency Working Group on 
          Cryptography Policy 
 
 
     Attached for your review and comment is a draft paper 
entitled "Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public 
Safety in the Global Information Infrastructure." It presents 
a vision and course of action for developing a cryptographic 
infrastructure that will protect valuable information on 
national and international networks. 
 
     The draft paper is the result of the many discussions we 
have had with interested parties concerning the use of 
encryption. While those discussions have explored the use of 
both key recoverable encryption and non-recoverable 
encryption, the draft paper addresses an infrastructure which 
uses key recoverable encryption. We believe such a key 
management infrastructure, voluntary and supported by *private 
sector* key management organizations, is the prospect of the 
near future. It would permit users and manufacturers free 
choice of encryption algorithm, facilitate international 
interoperability, preserve law enforcement access, and, most 
importantly, provide strong system security and integrity. 
 
     Recognizing that a robust infrastructure is not yet a 
reality, we are also considering measures to liberalize export 
policy for some non-escrowed products. Appendix II of the 
draft paper begins to summarize current policy, and we intend 
to expand and improve that section. 
 
     We believe that clearly articulating such a vision will 
accelerate the ability of the United States to realize the 
full advantages of the global network for commerce, security 
and public safety. However, such a vision cannot become a 
reality unless it is widely shared. Therefore, rather than 
being a finished product, the attached paper is a draft which 
we ask you to help us improve. We hope it will contribute to 
constructive discussion and promote a clearer understanding of 
each others' needs and concerns regarding the use of 
encryption. 
 
     We welcome your comments and look forward to further 
discussion. Written comments may be sent to our attention, 
Room 10236, NEOB, Washington, D.C. 20503.
