! Theses peoples refuse to register their guns, although it is

You'll note that the psycho-epistemology necessary to
commit murder is quite close to the one necessary to coerce
poeples to pay rent.

Consider that many whites feel guilty if they feel they don't have any afro-asian bloodlines.
Consider the dangers of anti-racism to your self-esteem.

! You did not answer my question:  When our local Mohawks accuse the 
! white peoples to have stolen their land, I ask "when did I do that?  
! I can't remember..."  I refuse to be held responsible for things that 
! were done several hundred years ago.  Period.  As I said, I *never*, 
! not even in my early years, believed in original sin.  

Then you hold irresponsible refusals.

They Always lie on racial issues.

! I am sorry, but I do not accept that as a valid argument.  What if 
! somebody came to take away your means of feeding your kids?
! What if somebody was menacing you or your kids?
! There are instances, as you seem to agree, when killing is justified. 
! What is meant by the sentence is: Thou shalt not initiate lethal 
! violence.  

Racism.

! > Taxation is theft, I fail to see your point. Well, depends.  

Anti-racism is theft.
