No need for people to point this out, as my point was an hypothetical, to
show that there simply _is no objective standard_ in such matters.

For every proposed "ratings" system that involves value judgments about who
should see something, I can think of examples where a quite opposite view
is held.

I still think we are being led down a dangerous path in trying to architect
ratings systems. As I said, we don't rate written words (at least I don't),
we don't rate newspapers, etc.

If a system gets built into the WWW, as with proposals for PICS, it _will_
be used by those who want to control content. We should think twice before
helping in any way.

(No, I'm not _against_ private ratings services...but this has little to do
with _me_, and I won't participate. More importantly, I won't have my
content have any kind of tag attached! Thus, the PICS thing looks intrusive
to me, and not at all what I think of as a "private ratings service." I'll
elaborate if my point is unclear.)
