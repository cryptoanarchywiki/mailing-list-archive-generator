NEWS

Rave reviews of Senator Leahy's appearance on HotWired's WiredSide chat
are coming already.  With this appearance, the gentleman from Vermont
proves once again that he knows net.politics on a personal level, and
can understands the subtleties that we assume many in Congress are just
learning.

If you missed Sen. Leahy's appearance, arranged by HotWired, the Center
for Democracy and Technology (CDT), and the Voters Telecommunications
Watch (VTW), you can still hear the Realaudio transcript from the
front page at http://www.crypto.com/

A new Clipper III section has been added to www.crypto.com, with pointers
to the online version of the White House proposal and the initial analyses
from EPIC, CDT, and John Gilmore of the EFF.


                                DON'T FORGET!

Representative Rick White (R-WA) will be on HotWired Wednesday June 5th
at 9pm EST at http://www.hotwired.com/wiredside/  You can tune in and listen
to the chat with the RealAudio software (http://www.realaudio.com).  You can
ask questions of the Representative through a moderator and get real,
immediate responses.

Rep. White is part of the new breed of legislators leading Congress to
make better net policy through his leadership in the Internet Caucus,
a vanguard group of legislators who have vowed to provide sound leadership
and advice to other members of Congress in the area of net.policy.
