   5-14-96. FiTi: 
 
   Reports on "Photobook," a "visual intelligence" comp.sys  
   for facial recognition designed by Alex Pentland at MIT's  
   Media Lab to "identify people who use multiple  
   identifications to commit fraud." 
 
   BT, the US Army, Kodak and Sensormatic are nibbling and the 
   White House is ogling it to "combat terrorism." Also: 
 
      The program could help find missing children, verify 
      indentification for electronic purchases and track down 
      on-line pornographers. Although the Big Brother aspect 
      may be troubling to some, to others it will provide 
      comforting security.
