The US decided that the end justifies any means, and thus decided to

They are free to charge more. Oh, I forgot, prices are regulated...

When grand'pa came to Canada in 1912 with his parents and his 11
brothers and sisters, he and they did not have a penny, nor did they
speak the language nor had access to any socialistic programs.  When
he and his sister and brothers died, most of them were wealthy.  And
all they did all their life was to grow vegetables.  They had very
good reputations and I do not know any story of any one of them being
con men. `

Why assume that I hid in some closet? I did not militate either.  I
do not endorse libertarian ideas.  I've never read any "libertarian"
litterature.  I only read a bit of Ayn Rand, and the regular
Objectivists will tell you that they are *not* libertarians. Actually
they object to the libertarian doctrine.  And again, I am no
objectivist.  Many of them refuse to talk to me.

Why don't you just use a microwave link?  Oh, I forget, the FCC might 
not permit it...  And then, why don't you just get together all the 
bunch of peoples and decide to obtain a right of way for a community 
cable that would carry data?  And while you are at it, maybe you can 
try a fiberoptic company to subsidize you, tax-deductible from their 
income... It's worth a shot!  Oh, but again, the FCC and half a dozen 
other ministry might object.

You don't find enough donations? No problems, simply sell your 
project, aided by your reputation, to every neighboor.  Simply issue 
shares to raise money...  Oh, again, I forgot, the SEC would 
object...

How does a data link cost compare (long term and short term) to the 
initial expense of purchasing a computer?  Like, since you mentionned 
it, how much did your project cost per user?

Not at all.  We only realize that the cost of building 
infrastructures in *this* statist world is almost not affordable.

Why don't you read about railroad history and come back later?
