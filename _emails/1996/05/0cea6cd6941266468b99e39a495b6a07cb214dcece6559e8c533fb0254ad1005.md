Good and valid points about the CPA's hypocrisy and inanity, but this
doesn't really address the bill (was it meant to?). 

CDA + CPA = bad. CDA = bad. CPA is still indeterminate.

I recognize that criminalizing the free flow of information is like trying
to stick your finger in a dike, but every little bit has an effect. In
this case, I'd call it a positive effect. 

I was certainly disappointed to hear a couple of cypherpunks the other day
discussing for-profit offshore data havens full of personal information
that is illegal to collect in the US as a business opportunity *they* were
interested in pursuing. I just can't see myself doing that, for anybody.
Gubmint or private, doesn't matter.
