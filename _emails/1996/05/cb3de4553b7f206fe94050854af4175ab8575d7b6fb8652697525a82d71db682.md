this is really horrible. I hope that no precedent of having internet
providers involvement in ratings is *ever* established. this proposal
reeks. separate ratings from content and delivery.

"content-providers" != internet providers. that former is OK. the
latter is a horrible nightmare. please, please, please, 
I hope this system is not asking/demanding people who run hardware 
& communication services to get into the rating business.
 such a thing is atrocious and odious
and exactly what should be avoided.

the government becomes just another rating agency. I don't like it either.
but as long as we emphasize, "the individual always has the ultimate
decision", which fortunately this press release does,
little can go awry, hopefully.
