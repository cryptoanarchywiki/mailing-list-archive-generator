Oh, I have no doubt that he believes everything you tell him. So, Charles,
do you think I'm a net.loon, and why? Please reply publicly on
cypherpunks. I'd like E. Allen Smith and Jim Bell to read this.

Declan, I sincerely apologize by "avoiding" you by going to a long-
scheduled DHCP implementation meeting with Rob Riepel and Roger Avedon
rather than taking your one call.  As I told you, again, yesterday, my
alphanumeric pager can be reached via rich@beep.stanford.edu (80
characters from the Subject: line), and I'd be happy to talk to you at any
convenient time outside working hours.
