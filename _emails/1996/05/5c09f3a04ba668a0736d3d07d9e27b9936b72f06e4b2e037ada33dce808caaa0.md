	Hmm.... has anyone ever created a specialized computer (or computer
running a specialized program) that would put multiple screens on the same
screen, perhaps with some GUI manipulation capabilities? If they're trying to

exact same situation from their viewpoint.

	I should have remembered this from reading Liar's Poker; thank you.
