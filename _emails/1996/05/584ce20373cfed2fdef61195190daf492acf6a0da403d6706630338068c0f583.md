Not that I am aware of. David Chaum (DigiCash) holds the patents on the
blinding technology that lies at the core of Ecash.

Coin based software that uses blinding would infringe on DC's patents.

That is not the case. At this time, there is only one Ecash issuing bank in
each country that has an Ecash issuing bank. There is no reason why there
might not be several Ecash issuing banks in a given country in the future.

Such companies could negotiate a deal with one of the current Ecash issuers
in which the company gets exclusive use of one of the many currencies that
all Ecash mints are capable of issuing.
