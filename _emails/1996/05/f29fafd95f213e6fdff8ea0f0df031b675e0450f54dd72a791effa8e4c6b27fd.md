Of course.  With the modified protocol the payor has no choice in the matter.
It's a case of giving the payor a blinded unsigned coin and demanding he get the bank
to sign it - if he doesn't do this the payee will notice immediately.
Even with payor and bank collusion there is nothing that can be done to identify
the payee.
