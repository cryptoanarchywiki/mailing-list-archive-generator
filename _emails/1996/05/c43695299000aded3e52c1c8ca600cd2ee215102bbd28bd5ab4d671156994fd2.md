	This does, of course, depend on one's knowing where the holes in the
OS are. The Java approach, at least by default, appears to be to shut all
the places where they think a hole might be, while leaving open those which an
applet practically has to use. (E.g., it shouldn't be possible under the
current design for an untrusted applet to access the disk; since an applet does
need to use the CPU, it can consume CPU time.)

	I suppose that the new certificate is created through a message
signed by the old certificate's private key?
