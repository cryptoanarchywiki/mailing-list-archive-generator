no, you want credit, otherwise you wouldn't care ("cyberanarchy"? how
far is that? in many ways it is more descriptive/accurate for what
is being connoted).  you get credit when people use "your" term, the
etymology you love to wax on occasionally here.

a pseudo-word that you invented. any pseudo-word is as good as any other.

I think you need to reevaluate your life when you get upset that people
don't use word you invented. for example the term "pseudospoofing"
has many applications to recent news but has never been properly used by 
journalists.  (hee, hee)
