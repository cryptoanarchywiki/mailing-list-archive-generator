Does Tempest detects only the emission from the electron gun in the 
monitor or can it get a usable "lock" on some other signals generated 
within a computer?

As an example, can it grab the keystrokes?  If the answer is yes, can 
it do it:

a) rarely
b) occasionally
c) most of the time
d) almost all of the time
e) never

Could somebody knowledgeable in Tempest can rate the various 
emissions from a computer?

(such as: keyboard, COM port, modem, lpt, video signal(from the 
card), disk write, monitor emission, network comms, etc)

Ciao

JFA
Just curious...
