Be careful to distingiush "owner" from "employee."  All to common a

Until someone passes a constitutional right to not be fired, well, you're

He also made a killing on predicting crops by his knowledge of the
weather.  Go with what you know.  If you aren't a good corporate analyist,
that's what mutual fund managers are for.
