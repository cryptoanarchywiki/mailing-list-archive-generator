There are a couple of main reasons that the poor spend more than their
reported income.  First, many of the elderly are included in the "poorest
20%", since this is based on income alone and not net worth.  Many of the
elderly are spending down their retirement savings.  Another factor, of
course, is that welfare, food stamps, free/subsidized housing and other
transfer payments are not included in income calculations.  I have seen
reports that show that in many states, this is equivalent to a full-time
job paying ~$9/hr.  Not showing these as income helps keep the "official"
poverty rate high.  I'm not sure if social security is included in income
calculations for "poverty rate" purposes, anyone know?
