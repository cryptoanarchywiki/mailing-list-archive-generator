	Would this be extensible to the remailer question by saying "agree to
hold us blameless for the contents of this mail or don't mail it back to us
for decoding"? Admittedly, this might not get around the problem of overly
long mail used for bombing, but with Mixmaster you'd get such a letter for
each section as I understand it.
