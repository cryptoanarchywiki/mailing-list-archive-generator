Libyan embassies don't get bombed. They just have thugs shooting unarmed 
WPCs from them under protection of diplomatic immunity (I used to live in 
Pimlico, and went to college in South Kensington, and going past the 
Yvonne Fletcher memorial always got me upset

Anyway, they're not just state sponsored terrorists, they're the actual 
terrorist state, and can thus can easily get access to whatever 
crypto they want; in extrimis shipping OTPs by diplomatic pouch; it's the 
smaller, unofficial groups where the case is most easily made.

If I thought that restricting crypto were possible, I might be convinced 
by solid argument along this line, though as a Londoner and having spent 
some time working in Israel, I'm probably easier to convince than most 
people here (just about the only tube station I used to use regularly 
that wasn't hit by the IRA was Chigwell, and that isn't wholly a good 
thing :-). 

However, now that the four horses have gone, and all that's left in the
stable are the my little ponies, why slam the barn door and bop their
noses for no good reason?
