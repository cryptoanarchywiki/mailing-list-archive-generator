Summary:

Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ) and Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) have introduced 
the Children's Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act. The bill 
would establish fair information practices for personal information about 
kids and curb recent abuses in the direct marketing industry.

The Children's Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act would:

Prohibit the sale or purchase of personal information about children 
   without parental consent.

Require list brokers and solicitors to disclose to parents, upon request,
   the source and content of personal information on file about their 
   children.

Require list brokers to disclose to parents, upon request, the names of 
   persons or entities
   to whom they have distributed personal information on that 
   parent's child.

Prohibit prisoners and convicted sex criminals from processing the personal 
   information of children.

Prohibit any exchange of children's personal information that one has a reason
   to believe will be used to harm or abuse a child.
