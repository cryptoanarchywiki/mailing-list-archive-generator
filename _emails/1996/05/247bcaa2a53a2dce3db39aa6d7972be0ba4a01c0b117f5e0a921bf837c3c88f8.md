I can just visualize a trusted party dropping discretely a bright
yellow Caterpillar D-12 in a dead letter box... ROTFL!

Sorry, but I couldn't resist.  I just *love* silly humor...

Why? is it because of the nature of a transfer, it lend itself more 
to reporting and detecting?  Or is it simply because of the legal 
system structure?

I think that Mr. Bell defined the context quite well and thoroughly.
And, as he said, the president is unlikely to be the target of
choice because it is not the most efficient one.  Who cares about the 
president?  Who is he without the govt machine?

If anonymous transactions are feasible, so will be the AP scheme...
AP can be, in a way, characterized as a weapon because it behaves
like one.  And no weapon in the history of humanity remained unused.

Theses were the first two that constitued part 1 of 4.  I wondered if 
you posted the other parts.  If so, tell me so I can get to the 
archives.
