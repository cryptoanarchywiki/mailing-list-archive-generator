	Quite. The poor can get away with this for multiple reasons, including
being on more of a cash-based economy. But the largest reason is probably
that the IRS doesn't care nearly as much about each individual at the low
end of the income ladder as they do about any evasion involving a lot of money.
Now, the low end tax evasion probably costs the government a lot more than
the rich does... but it's also a lot harder to pursue.
