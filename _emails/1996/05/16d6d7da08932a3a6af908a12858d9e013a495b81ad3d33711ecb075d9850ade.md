The people who run www.whowhere.com (a knockoff on the excellent
www.four11.com, with a database partly based on a script they wrote to
extract addresses from okra.ucr.edu) want to discuss how they can serve
the Internet community better while protecting privacy.

I suggested "shut down your site and become cloistered monks," but they
didn't find that consistent with their business plan. So they suggested we
do lunch early next week. Either Monday or Tuesday would work, and we'd be
meeting in downtown Palo Alto. Anybody else interested in coming? 

For a good demonstration of why WhoWhere? is not necessarily the greatest
thing since spice racks, look up "Louis Freeh," "Fuck You,"  "Asshole,"
"System Privileged User," and "Stephen Hawking." I keep telling them that
they'd better remove this last, but they don't consider it a priority.

P.S.   Yes, I just resubscribed. I just love you too much to stay away.

P.P.S. If anyone wants to carpool from the Palo Alto vicinity to Joe &
       Cindy's beach volleyball shindig this Sunday with an alleged
       FUCKING STATIST CAPITALIST SOCIALIST NAZI J*W ANARCHIST, send me
       a note.
