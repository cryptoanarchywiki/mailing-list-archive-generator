Exactly so:

Some nyms are valuable, most are valueless by design.  All remailers
should be valueless by design.  The penet.fi remailer design is 
unsatisfactory precisely because it penet.fi is valuable, hence a
target.  If it gets shut down a lot of people lose their nyms, 
causing much inconvenience.
