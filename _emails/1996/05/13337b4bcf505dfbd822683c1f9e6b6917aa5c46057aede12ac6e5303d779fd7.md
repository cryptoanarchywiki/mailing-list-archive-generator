According to your report, the guy made a comparison to MacDonalds,
having only 10.000 outfits in the US compared to the Post Office
having 50.000. But MacDonalds has a strong international presence
while the US Post Office has almost none. And then one could eat
a tasty burger, waiting for one's smartcards to get signed by the
trustworthy attendants (I mean, they do where uniforms).
