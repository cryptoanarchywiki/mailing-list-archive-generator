Since I hit C'punks around 6 months ago, I have no idea who this 
mythical figure is, alhought I see the name pop-up occasionnally.

Is there a Detweiller FAQ somewhere?

Interesting.  Has AP ever popped-up in the conventional medias?

Then, again, I know an awfull lot of people who would applaude Bell.  
But most of them are not computer litterate.  They are from another 
generation, not brainwashed by "Don't ask what your country can 
do for you; ask what you can do for your country"...

[Black humor] any AP proponents with an eye (or a buck) on you?  :)

Please, do point out the similarities and the differences... I think 
that the context is very different.

Are you talking of an open war a la Bosnia?

This is what I was talking about taking things out of context.  Since 
you agree on that, the Cherokee thing is ruled out.  But govt action 
are a matter of the present and future.  Some peoples see it as 
legitimate self-defense.

Among the peoples who do not object to be coerced to pay taxex for 
services are two groups the one that:
a) figure out that they get more than they pay
	and
b) want to pay, even if they realize they get less than they pay for.

the a) group is much bigger than b).  At least by an order of 
magnitude.

Now, in a world where the govt would not use coercion on economical 
and fiscal matters, b) would keep giving.  But what a) would do? 
What they've already done since a hundred years: push for legislation 
that favor them.


> Bottom line for me: "Two wrongs don't make a right." 

Please state the basic premise that make you declare what is "wrong"
in the context of AP.  I am not bugging you simply to do so.  For
example, do you think that, for ethical reasons, you are not only
justified but actually *obligated* to use physical violence in
certain contexts?  I guess not.  But many peoples think they have
to...

I think that you simply try to evade the necessity of defining for 
yourself what exactly is what the govt is doing.

Personnally, I did not reach any conclusions yet.

General opinion is not what define truth nor reality.  If I refuse
to pay my taxes, they'll use physical violence to get what they
want.  You might object that I enjoyed the benefits of the spending
of taxes, but I am yet to see any contract that I entered with
"society".

This scheme is *not* an oligarchy.  Pay a visit to any good dictionary 
near you.  Words have precise meaning and it is *much* better to 
stick to it...

Actually, since it is ruled by money, it might be a "buckarchy", but 
again, everybody can spare a few bucks, so it might be a democracy 
too if you insist on twisting the meaning of words.

At first look, of course.  But operationnally, you have to consider the 
mind of the statist to figure out the likeliness of their using the 
system? I do not deny that it is very likely that a few statists will 
use the system.  But most won't because they don't like to slain 
their milk cows.

Remember, we are idea-processing machines.

Many peoples cannot stand to see any opinions that differs from 
theirs.  But why care at all be read by such peoples?
