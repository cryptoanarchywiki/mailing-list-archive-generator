I'm confused as to how "merely" putting your after-tax (you *will*
declare this consulting revenue on your Schedule C, won't you?) bucks
in an offshore account will "save" you money.  This only "works" if you
are able to use what you've taken away to advantage; you may generate a
tax "savings" on those gains.  Oh, and it also only works if you are
willing to expose yourself to being arrested at some point for tax
evasion.

This is silly; there are legitimate reasons for structuring business
efforts in other tax juristictions.  Avoiding income tax on your
primary source income isn't one of them.

My answer to the original question: save your $1k you'd send to Sandy
for the "advice" (plus travel associated with finding your 'haven') and
open a SEP.
