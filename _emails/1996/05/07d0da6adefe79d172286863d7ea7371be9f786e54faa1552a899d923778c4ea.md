Not so.  Just send postal money orders totalling US$1000 to:

			Sandy Sandfort
			Simple Access
			One Sutter St., #500
			San Francisco, CA 94104
			USA

Have it made out to me, or leave the payee blank and sign it with 
an illegible scrawl.  Include a for-this-purpose-only public key, 
and I'll give you more advice through the remailer of your choice.  
Q.E.D.

I'm shocked that I would have to explain this to a member of this
list.
