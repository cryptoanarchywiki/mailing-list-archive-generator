The minimum denomination for each currency is (sort of)
configurable. For instance, for Belgian Franks the minimum is 1 (and
no '.'). If a bank requested a currency capable of handling a
mimimum of 0.00005 we could make that happen real easy. Note that
with the maximum coin size 2^15 times minimum amount, the maximum
coin would get a lot smaller, so that it would become more
impractical to pay large amounts in that currency.

On the longer term we can of course even change
- the 2^15 maximum
- maximum number of coins per message (currently 75)
if the requirements were there.
