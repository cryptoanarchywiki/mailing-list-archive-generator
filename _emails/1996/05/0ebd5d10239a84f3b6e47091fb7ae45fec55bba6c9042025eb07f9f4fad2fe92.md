You might find hints at "the briefing" in some of the recent terrorist-porno
novels by Tom Clancey (for example). Also, "Spike" by Arnaud de Bouchgrave
(apologies for possible misspelling) is an interesting book to read between
the lines

The briefing might go something like this: "Remember the terrorist bombing of
the Libian Embassy? Well, "they" were planning to bomb the <??> embassy,
but we intercepted their messages and prevented the attack.
