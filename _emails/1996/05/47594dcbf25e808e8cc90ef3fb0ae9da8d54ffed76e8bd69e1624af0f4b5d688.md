Perry, that essay was, as I said, sent out before it was finished. I did
not even get to the part I was planning about classifying the Java
supporters/detractors as either scruffies or neats!

Now, while you may have _anticipated_ the point I was going to make in the
completed essay, you cannot say I have "mischaracterized" anyone's attitude
at this point!

Unless you have a source of thiotimoline I'm not aware of.

Boycott "Big Brother Inside" software!
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
