Well, you might have a point.  And I hope so.  The AP scheme finds its
uses mainly against govts or non-anonymous large entities that are
perceived as coercive in nature.  I do not think that it will become
prevalent in the inter-individual interactions.

What I hate about the scheme is that I see it being used for pulling
down peoples that are too good at what they do.  I never pretended
that petty feelings, jalousy and envy does not exists.  I can see at
least half of the business peoples putting a price on another half of
a given field.  I personnally believe that most peoples were thaught
screwed-up ethics and that therefore, they are highly unpredictable.

But I doubt that AP won't get started locally for various reasons and
various uses.

As for Jim Bell's opinion that it might overtake govt, it might be
true.  After all, the initial reason for anonymity, if not for conning
somebody else but to protect oneself from government's point of
view...

An anonymous transaction system would become hunted down by govt
pretty quickly.  They could probably prosecute zip out of anybody but
OTOH, they could very well make life a living hell for many
individuals.  The natural reaction for some of theses individuals
would be to seek/set-up an AP server.  And from that moment, the news
and reward would be known around the world within a short time, even
to peoples not connected to the net.
