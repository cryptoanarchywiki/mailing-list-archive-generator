	Accounting costs as a result of a deduction based,
	multi-tiered, progressive, and supplimented system of income
	taxation are silly.

By the way, the IRS (in spite of it's shortcomings) is (by far) the
most efficient tax collecting organization among the major economic
powers.  It costs roughly $0.50 per $100 collected.  Canada is second
at about $1, Germany (for instance) is at about $7, mostly because they
don't have payroll deductions.
