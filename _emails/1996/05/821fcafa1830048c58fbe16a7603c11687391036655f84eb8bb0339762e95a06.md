The Java Wallet is supposed to work with any Java enabled browser. The
wallet takes care of moving all the data even through firewalls, so I would
assume it just piggy-backs on http. Note that anyone can create a Wallet
"cassette" for their own present of future payment system. In order for the
cassette to work with the wallet, it needs to be signed by Java Soft. Java
Soft will charge for the sigs. Last I heard, the exact fee was still
undecided.
