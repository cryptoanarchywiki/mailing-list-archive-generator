Nah, that would be "eli++".  Or better, "++eli".  Actually, this keeps
CMU's overly-clever mail system from delivering my mail to an "Edward
Lawrence Immelmann" -- it prefers initials to login names.

But PK doesn't make the key distribution problem go away.  This thread
has been about a particular approach to PK key distribution, the web
of trust, and how to model its behavior.

Generally insufficient.  If someone is going to go to the trouble of a
key-substitution attack, they're going to take the time to compose a
plausible response.  This approach is useful if the intended recipient
*is* well-known to you.
