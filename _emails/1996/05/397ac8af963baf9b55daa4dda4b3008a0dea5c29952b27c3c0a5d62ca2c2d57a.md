   The S/MIME spec indicates the use of X.509v3 certificates, which, in
turn, are explicitly allowed to contain trust roots originating in the
client's local configuration. In other words, yes, the spec allows for a
Web of trust.
   The big question, of course, is how easy the key management will be
in such a case. Everything I've seen points to key management being
super-easy if you use VeriSign certs, and probably just as bad as PGP
otherwise. Unlike PGP, most e-mail clients will probably not come
configured with the capablity to sign other keys - in the X.500 world,
e-mail clients and "certification authorities" are two separate
applications.
   But it's too early to tell. There's a lot of ferment happening here.
