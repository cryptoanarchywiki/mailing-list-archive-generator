It's not just for me.  I seem to recall a comment around here (Tim May, 
perhaps?) who said that when he first read of digital cash in the late 
1980's, the feature of payee anonymity was present, and that he was 
surprised later to see early implementations not containing this.

Deal with the devil?

Any "complete" digital cash implementation has to provide for payee anonymity.
