No, I don't think "low literacy" in some subcultures is something that
"needs to be taken care of." If members of that subculture think it a bad
thing that their kids (not to mention themselves) are not readers and are
not sufficiently literate to thrive in a high-tech world, then they need to
take steps to change the basic values of their subculture.

As I mentioned, many subcultures--too numerous to name, actually--have a
strong belief in literacy, learning, and success, and are doing extremely
well in modern American society. Other subcultures do not, and are seeing
the fruits of their bad values realized. (One notable subculture currently
has 40% of its adult male population either in prison, on parole, under
indictment, or otherwise involved with the legal system in a debilitating
way. This same subculture now has close to an 85% illegitimacy rate.)

There is nothing "I" can do about such subcultures. Loads of tax dollars
have not helped. As Charles Murray points out in "Losing Ground," the loads
of tax dollars and special giveaways to some subcultures have very likely
made the situation much worse than it was 30-40 years ago when the programs
started.

"True democracy" is actually much worse than what we have now. The
advantage of what we are doing with strong cryptography is that it
undermines democracy.
