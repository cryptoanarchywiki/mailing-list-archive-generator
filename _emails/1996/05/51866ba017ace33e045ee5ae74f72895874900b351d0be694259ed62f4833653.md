Of course, this appears to be implying that _domestic_ data will be subject
to Clipper 3  restrictions, else this statement is meaningless.

So, will my stored-value cards that I "charge up" in California and carry
in my wallet to Zurich be GAKked? If not, Morris's statement is
meaningless. If so, domestic data is intended to be GAKked.

(But we knew this, didn't we?)
