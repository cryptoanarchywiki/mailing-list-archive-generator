PICS.

	In other words, the CyberAngels want to eliminate any pages that
contain material they think minors shouldn't see that aren't self-rated with
a PICS self-rating (the first of the three types) intended to block minors
from seeing it. Yes, this is an abuse of the market oriented variety of PICS;
they obviously don't know and/or don't care. If you want to convince them
otherwise, start cc:ing your messages (and forwarding mine, on this I give you
permission) on PICS and the CyberAngels to angels@wavenet.com.
	Incidentally, their pressure (especially the legal variety - acting as
informants) could also include against an ISP that doesn't do the second for
material the CyberAngels don't like.
