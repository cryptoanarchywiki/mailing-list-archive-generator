THE LATEST NEWS

Senator Burns went online tonight and discussed encryption and his
new bill, PRO-CODE, with Internet users in America Online's News Room
auditorium.  The full transcript of this session is available at
http://www.crypto.com/.  Some highlights from the fifty minute discussion:

Question   : Senator Burns, As a small business in Montana that provides
  	     web-space to local Montana businesses, I'm concerned that the
	     lack of privacy and security on the Net will keep many of my 
	     potential customers from purchasing online. How will this bill
	     help?
Sen Burns  : That's exactly why I introduced this bill. Right now I don't
	     think any of us feel safe transmitting our credit card numbers
	     over the Internet, and many companies who have workers around
	     the nation or world are worried about how they can safely send
	     sensitive information back and forth between them. If we can
	     raise their level of security, we can guarantee that that
	     information will be sent without unwanted eyes looking in.



Question   : What do you think the Administration, FBI, and NSA reaction
	     to your bill will be? Have you already heard from them? (I run
	     an ISP in Missoula, Montana.)
Sen Burns  : We expect them to have some concern with this, and we will work
	     with them but we have to undertsnad that the people we are 
             concerned with can already gain encryption that is already
	     longer than 40 bits on teh international market.
