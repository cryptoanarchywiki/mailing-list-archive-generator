	One application of an anonymous remailer that has come up is using POP
to get into an account via which remailing could be done without the remailer
having to run on the machine receiving/sending the mail. It would instead occur
on a machine running the remailer software and equipped for doing POP. Has
anyone written a mixmaster version (or additions onto Mixmaster) that will do
this automatically?
	While having the entire remailer with logs and private key in a
different country would still be best, if an anonymous POP account were used
this would still shield the remailer operator from forced disclosure. It would
also cut down on the costs; for instance, offshore.com.ai's monthly price for
a UNIX shell account is 50$ a month, but theirs for an email-only account is
20$ a month (albeit with only 20 M/month of mail). 
	Thanks,
	-Allen
