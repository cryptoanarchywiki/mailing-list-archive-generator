Almost.  Actually, they mention at one point that they don't want to 
GAK the signature keys, but it's almost an afterthought.

The thing I find peculiar is that they wand GAK through access to private
keys in a PKI, ala Micali or Banker's Trust, but the only keys which need
to be in a PKI are signature keys -- ones even they admit should not be
recovered.

Can you spell "empty intersection", boys and girls?

:)

Mighty clever of the cryptographer who started them down this path.
