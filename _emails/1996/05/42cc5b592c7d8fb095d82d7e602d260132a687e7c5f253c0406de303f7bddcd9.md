Uh, so the whole of this plan relies on.

1)  The secrecy of the company.
2)  The secrecy of every 'employee' in the country
3)  Mr. May's ability to conceal his domestic spending.

Do you understand how naive this sounds?  Do you understand the extent to
which you are over simplifying the situation?

The plot thickens.
Do you know that there is imposed on U.S. citizens (corporations included)
a withholding tax for payments to foreign entities subject to U.S.
taxation?

In this case the people paying the offshore company for Mr. May's services
are also subject to reporting requirements and a 30% withholding tax for
which they will be held liable.

This adds the requirement that the individuals or corporations receiving
Mr. May's service be involved in this conspiracy.  If they could have
been, why do you need the offshore connection?  Why not just conspire with
them to pay Mr. May in cash and not report it?

Puhlease.

Continue your participation in such a plan.  I will send you cigs.
