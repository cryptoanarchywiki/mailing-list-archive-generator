   5-28-96. NYPaper: 
 
   "Physicists Put Atom In 2 Places At Once." 
 
      A team of NIST physicists has proved that an entire atom 
      can simultaneously exist in two widely separated places. 
      The achievement not only sheds light on the paradox of 
      Schrodinger's cat but could also have important 
      consequences for cryptography, a science that creates 
      codes to safeguard the electronic transfer of money, 
      state secrets and other valuable things.
