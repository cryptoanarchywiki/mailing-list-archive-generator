	I was thinking about this last night, hence my question about
running mixmaster under Xenix (or minux for that matter).

	How about this as an idea:

	Get a few (3 to 5) accounts in a high density market (i.e. lots of
ISP's locally) set up a unix machine on a cheap machine. Have the anon
messages get sent to the pop accounts. Once an hour (or less depending on
budget) have the unix box poll the different pop accounts mix the messages
and resend them the next hour. 
	This could be further obfuscated by batching the messages up and
posting a whole chunk of messages to a different similar remailer else
where, or by just plopping an encrypted tar'd file on a ftp site where
another remailer grabs them and splits and remails them.
