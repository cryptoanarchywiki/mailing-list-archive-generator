        Perhaps someone with a better legal understanding of court cases
could help me out. I understood from a law course I took that appeals could
only be filed with respect to process rather than result. One cannot appeal
a decision, rather one has to appeal the manner in which it was reached (if
witnesses were biased, important evidence was suppressed, etc.) I was rather
surprised by this, but obviously this doesn't prevent people from appealing
willy-nilly because they just fabricate some reason why the process was
corrupted.

        However, in a venue such as this, what basis can one appeal on? On
the ACLU side I can actually see an appeal with respect to the
constitutionality (but I'm not quite sure what) and on the Reno side I don't
see what they could appeal. Was some evidence poorly presented? It isn't
like there are any witnesses to lead.
