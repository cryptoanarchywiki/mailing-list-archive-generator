	democracy is _never_ the ideal government. the difference in the

    republic in the techno age is that the press and/or advertising 
    creates the images --and can be bought, stolen, coerced, etc.

        my intent is to "lament" that the American voters do not 
    influence the choice of candidates --who are vetted my money, or 
    money's interests. 

        most mat not wish to consider the hidden importance of the CFR

    group with an agenda --except they have the money and influence to
    _buy_ the agenda over time --amd on their schedule.
