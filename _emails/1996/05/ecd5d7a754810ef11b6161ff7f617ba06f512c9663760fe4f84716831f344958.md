I normally don't read or post to this list, so I'm hoping e$pam will pick
up any relevant replies or people Cc: me personally (information overload).

My ignorance is probably showing, but it seems that we have a real
fundamental problem here.  IP numbers of re-mailers, whether free or 
commercial, are easily identified and therefore become easy sniffing 
targets.  This means that the choke points currently used to censor and 
otherwise restrict information can easily come into play - i.e. ISP's 
(we've already seen censorship being applied to at the ISP level, so we 
have sufficient aggregation to filter and sniff).

Therefore, in the abscence of roving remailer destinations that change 
quick enough to evade some sniffing (notice, I didn't say avoid), it 
seems that there really is no anonymity.  Even if we could randomize 
destinations (a la Pirate Radio with roving dial locations), that would 
defeat the purpose - the ability to allow anybody to use anonymous 
remailers.  So, if we feel this capability is important (and I do), how 
do we solve the problem?
