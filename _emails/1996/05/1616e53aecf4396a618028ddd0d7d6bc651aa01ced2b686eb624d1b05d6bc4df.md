The issue at hand was legal and non-tax evasion type advantages.  If by
"bad-boys" you mean private plaintiff's, then your position might apply to
the question at hand.  If, on the otherhand, it refers to the IRS or
government types, it won't.

The IRS may or may not know what's in the tax legislation books, or the
code or the regulations which the treasury itself submits.  This is not
the point.  The point, in legal tax avoidance cases, (as distinguished
from illegal ones) is that _you the taxpayer_ know, and can defend your
actions during process.

Again, the author was not asking for tax evasion advice, but tax avoidance
advice.

In any event, I'm not talking about technicalities or "magic pieces of
paper," but rather utilizing the loopholes that are built into the tax
process to your advantage.  There are small loopholes in which you might
get your head stuck, and larger ones that pose little or no risk, and
still larger and intended policy oriented ones which are literally
sanctioned by the authorities.  Many of these are as available to the
small taxpayer as to a MNE.

God knows I've written enough about illegal asset concealing, but that's
not the issue here.

Replies to e-mail would probably be prudent.
