Sorry to send this in blind.  Over a year ago I switched from watching
the "mutitions" R&D works to being an observer/participant on a small
"test war."  Once in a while, I send in a report.  If you have comments
which you want me to see, email them.  Thanks,  Keith Henson

Hoyos, you *can't* destroy copyright, period.  Trade secrets are another
matter, and I suppose you can make a case that the ability of a certain
powerful cult to extract money or labor from the gulible has been reduced. 

I know some of the people who wrote the first cypherpunk remailers.  
They have been watching the uses to which the remailers have been put.
The long drawn out battle between the CoS and the Net has been of as
much interest to them as the performance of large guns at the front
was to Krup.   I can't speak for all of them--actually, I can't speak
for *any* of them, but the ones who have said anything about the
recent uses of the remailers do not seem unhappy.  There may be
some discussion related to this on the cypherpunks mailing list.
But if you sign up, be prepaired for a flood.  Keith Henson
