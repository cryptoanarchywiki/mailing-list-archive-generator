They probably will once the Post Bank gets going with ecash. Until then
there are legal difficulties. Swedish online merchants can't even accept
credit cards. They need an order in hand writing or voice before they
can charge the card.

My offer was to open an account with any ISP, whether they accept ecash
or not. I think that improves the anonymity of the account.
