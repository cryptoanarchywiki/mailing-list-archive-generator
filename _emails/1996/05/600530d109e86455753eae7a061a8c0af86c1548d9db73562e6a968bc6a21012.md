Okay, before you flame me and tell me to pipe it through
a symmetric cipher filter, hear me out.  Tape handling is
hairy, depending on what kind of functionality you want.  A regular
filter may write(2) in strangely sized blocks, not working very well
with your tape drive.

Mostly though, things get difficult when you have to/want to deal with
multiple tapes.

Although I could probably hack up "catblock" to do the job, and use
a line of the form
dump -0uBf ... | symmetric_cipher | catblock blockfactor > /dev/tape
if there exists something which already does this job, or something like it,
I'd like to know.  Now that I think about it, maybe this is the cleanest way.

PS: If there is a place where I can get reviews of the crypto software
that is out there, that'd be fab because csua just has a TON of stuff!
The "security-faq" is pretty good -- I want more! :)

Keep codin'
