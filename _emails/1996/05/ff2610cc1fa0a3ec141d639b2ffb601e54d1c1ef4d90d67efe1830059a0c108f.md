I can think of two good reasons for Senator Leahy to publish his key:

(1) To show his support for the right to use encryption.
(2) To sign open letters to the Internet community.

I will be really impressed when he gets some big-name signatures on his
key.  e.g. Matt Blase, Ron Rivist, PRZ, Tim May.
