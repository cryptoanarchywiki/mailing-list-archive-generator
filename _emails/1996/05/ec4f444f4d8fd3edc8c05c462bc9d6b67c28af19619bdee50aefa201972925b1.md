This is a very good idea.

It keeps the advantages of having persistent accounts (which other users,
chaining programs, etc. can use) while making it appear that the mail is
coming from another account.

"Security through obscurity," I hear you snort. Well, not really. The
_legal_ account is the one that an unhappy recipient sees on the "From:"
line. The Church of Scientology sees "disposable@foo.com" and fires off a
letter to foo.com requesting that foo.com cause this account to disappear.
So it does, but "transient@bar.com" picks up the slack.

An idea worth trying, of formally/legally separating the functions.

Of course, in some sense this is a special case of having disposable
accounts for "instant remailers" (see recent thread on this).

Traffic analysis will be quite easy to do, of course, as all mail sent to
the persistent address comes out of the "disposable@foo.com" address.
Q.E.D.

(Hal, to use him as the example, could start using his own choice of
remailer hops to accomplish much the same result. We've talked about this
for a long time, too. If I ran a remailer, I think I'd route *all* traffic
leaving my site through at least one other remailer...kind of a "hot
potato" effect. Of course, if _everyone_ did this, an infinite loop would
result. Lots of interesting twists, though, as messages could be set to
"leak out" of the loops.)

But this scheme, here, and Mark's scheme, are variants on the idea of
trying to make the remailers less clearly-identifiable targets.
