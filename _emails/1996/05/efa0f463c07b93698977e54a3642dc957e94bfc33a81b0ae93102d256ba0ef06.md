If he was indeed subscribed to 2200 mailing lists, you can assume that
he didn't read all the "welcome messages." For people who are stuck with
old fashioned mail systems (no filters, no macro language) this is a serious
problem. It would be rude to call the victims clueless and subscribe them to
even more "clueless mailing lists."
