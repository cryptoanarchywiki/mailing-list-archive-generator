But not a very good one, unfortunately.  Humor only works if it
has at least a nodding acquaintence with the truth.  This silly
screed had none. 

Once again we are treated to an attack on his betters by an 
anonymous nobody in the form of a feigned (and strained) mask of 
"witty" commentary.  What disappointments in life could have
produced such an impotent, resentful loser?
