	In general, I agree... but one important point to make is the contract.
If the contract says that you can require the employee to tap dance, then you
can require the employee to tap dance. If the contract _doesn't_ require the
employee to get shot, then the employee can refuse to get shot (including
shooting back if you try it anyway, bringing in law enforcement, etcetera.)
	The problem is that current contracts don't (usually) cover employee
privacy in its electronic aspects. They don't say whether or not the employer
can read your email. Thus, it's up in the air. If it says the employer can,
then the employer should be able to. If it says the employer can't, then the
employer shouldn't be able to - including via the employee using PGP to encrypt
the mail.
