The Internet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
Your question was:

> unsuscrive me from this list

And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} After serious contemplation on The Oracle's behalf and with his trusted 
} associates (read=lawyers), we have decided to deny you of this 
} privilege.  I, being the supreme knower of all, know that hidden deep 
} inside  of you there is this funny person waiting to escape from his dull 
} and dreary daily life.  You will remain on this list until further 
} notice.  Do not attempt to manually unsuscribe, as this will result in 
} physical bodily harm.  Trespassers WILL be shot.
} 
} You owe the Oracle a Freudian couch.
