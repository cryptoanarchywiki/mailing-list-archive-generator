Agreed. The more that can be explicitly spelled out about these matters, the
better.

A separate problem arises when the government compels the disclosure of
information for one purpose - getting a driver's license, say - and then
turns around and sells it to others. It's much harder to either negotiate a
new contract or go to a competitor when the other party is a government.
