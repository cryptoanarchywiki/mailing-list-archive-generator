A while back someone posted a note saying that an ecash protocol
garaunteeing payee as well as payer anonymity had been devised.

Did that ever get posted here?  The last message I saw said that it would 
be posted soon.

Also, I missed whatever discussion there was about why the archives got 
shut down.  Was it a copyright thing?  A lack of resources?  No one to 
volunteer?
