	After taking a look at www.cyberpass.net, I can see why you're
encoraging people to use it - about like Sameer encouraging people to use
c2.org. Your work on remailers does give you some reputation capital, however.
The signup form isn't very clear about anonymnity, BTW - I suggest dividing it
into optional and mandatory sections, and stating what will be the policy for
a lack of the optional ones. What's the 17- vs 18 differentiation for?
	Thanks,
	-Allen
