Absolute BS.  Since the late seventies, the mandatory registration
of all firearms purchased is in effect and you must hold a valid (in
french) A.A.A.F.   But you did not have to report firearms you
already owned.  But with our new law, you *have* to register them
within 7 years.  And apparently, you have to show proof of ownership 
of a registered firearm to buy ammunitions.  But I must read about 
this aspect a little more...
