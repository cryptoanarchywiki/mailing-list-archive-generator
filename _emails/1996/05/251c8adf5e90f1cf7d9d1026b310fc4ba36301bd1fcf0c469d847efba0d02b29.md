>   SAN JOSE, Calif. (May 27, 1996 12:53 p.m. EDT) -- Xilinx Inc. said it
>   will slash the price of some of its programmable microchips by as much

>   Xilinx said a new manufacturing process also will allow it to increase
>   performance of the chips, known as field programmable gate arrays,
>   which are found in a variety of complex electronic devices.
   
>   Xilinx said that by the end of the year, it expects to be selling its
>   XC5202 field programmable gate arrays for $5 apiece, down 44 percent
>   from an earlier projected price of $9. That price should decline to
>   $4.50 by mid-1997, Xilinx said.
   
>   The San Jose, California-based semiconductor maker said it also will
>   trim prices of more expensive gate arrays by as much as 53 percent,
>   bringing XC5210, for example, to $18 in mid-1997 from a current price
>   of $38.
   
>   The price cuts are for customers who purchase thousands of gate arrays
>   at a time.
