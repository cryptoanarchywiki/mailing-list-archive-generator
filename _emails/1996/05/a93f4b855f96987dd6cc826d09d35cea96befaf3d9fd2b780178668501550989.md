It wasn't the Fishman Affidavit that was posted - it was the NOTS materials.
The Affidavit material has been in a public court record for some years now,
and was an important factor in the favourable Dutch ruling. The NOTS have
never been subject to public scrutiny. In fact, the Church claims them as
trade secrets as well as copyrighted materials. That may or may not have
changed now that the NOTS have been viewed by who knows how many people.

The Church dislikes anonymous remailers intensely, despite exploiting their
advantages themselves. The few comments that their PR reps have made
indicate that the Church wants some way of stripping someone's anonymity
away if they "abuse" this anonymity. I dislike that idea intensely. Everyone
remember anon.penet.fi?

Like it or not, posting the NOTS _is_ a violation of copyright. While many
people think the Church of $cientology is abusing Intellectual Property laws
in order to keep their secret materials secret, the remailers have the
ability to violate _anyone's_ copyrights. I can imagine a scenario in which
the NSA starts spamming wholesale copyrighted works anonymously in order to
give the Government a compelling reason to legislate against anonymous
remailers.
