Sure, Alice can always herself add remailer steps. I explicitly mentioned
this in my  message last night, when I wrote: "(Hal, to use him as the
example, could start using his own choice of remailer hops to accomplish
much the same result. We've talked about this for a long time, too...."

But this is just using more remailers. We know this works. What Mark Grant
was suggesting was something different, a kind of "disposable final
emanation point," designed to go away easily under legal pressures.
