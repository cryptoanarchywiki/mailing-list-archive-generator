Incorrect.  There are many options for after-tax funds (including
investing in offshore corporations with active business income derived
elsewhere, offshore mutual funds, offshore funds in general, and the
advantage of extremely high interest rates in some jurisdictions).

The real trick is to structure things to take advantage of pre-tax funds.
This is complex, but certainly possible.  Did you know, for example, that
foreign tax credits can offset U.S. source income and can be carried back 
two and forward 5 years?

Incorrect.  There are many legitimate applications for placing funds
offshore that permit an individual to reduce his taxes legally.

False.  Avoiding tax is as legal as the constitution.  You mean evading
tax by failing to file truthful returns or otherwise concealing income.

Poor advice.  My advice to you, study tax a bit more carefully.
