Now three people, counting me, have corrected him.

I feel flattered knowing folks are actually watching
what I say so careully. If I'd only known, I would have
kept my mouth shut. I had a typospasm earlier today
during my pre-coffee jury-nullification rant this AM,
so I guess I should also try harder to do my best
to take care before hitting the ol' button.
