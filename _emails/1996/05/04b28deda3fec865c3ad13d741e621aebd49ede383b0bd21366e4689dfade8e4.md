Just the one I pointed out in theses two paragraphs.  I don't like 
the scheme either.

Here, again, Jim Bell would probably say that this sentence proves

I somehow agree with you here.

Well, here, you are threading on a very difficult path.  Of course, 
the ends does never justifies the means in an *uncoerced* context.  
But what JB says, is that AP would be a justified "self defense" 
against coercion.  It is only that the self-defense uses statistics.  
You'll note that the psycho-epistemology necessary to commit murder 
is quite close to the one necessary to coerce poeples to pay taxes.

Thus, he might pretend (JB) to only turn the living expression of an 
idea against itself.

Personnally?  I still was not able to sort it out...
