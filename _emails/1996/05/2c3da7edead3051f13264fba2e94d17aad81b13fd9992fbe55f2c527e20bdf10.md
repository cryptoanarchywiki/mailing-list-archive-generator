It should occur to all of us that if the NSA was actually doing the job we 
are vastly over-paying them to do, it is THEY who should be finding, 
exposing, and correcting these kinds of cryptography faults.  Has anybody 
ever heard any evidence that the NSA has ever acted in this sort of 
responsible role?

Another question:  If the government provided DSS, and it's now toast, and 
it provided Clipper...  Somebody ought to ask The Wicked.... er...  Dorothy 
Denning how she thinks we should be willing to trust the government's 
vetting of anything like Clipper when DSS may be flawed...and the government 
didn't find the error!

Think about it.
