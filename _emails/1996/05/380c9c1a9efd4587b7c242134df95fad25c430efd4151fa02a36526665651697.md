Nor was "excommunication" a political posting:  There was no 
indication in the posting as to whether the Burmese regime was 
left or right or fascist or whatever.

What the "Excommunication" post was about was the fact that good
communications undermine the state, and repressive states fear
them for that reason.  This is exactly the sort of post that should
be on cypherpunks.
