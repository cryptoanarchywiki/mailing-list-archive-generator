OK, someone tell me why the END USERS don't pay for this!

If a school wants to be wired, the local school board can pay for it (and
the local taxpayers can vote for the millage increase).  If you don't think
every five year old needs a net connection (maybe because you are afraid of
them seeing nekkid ladies, or because you just think teachers should teach
and not rely on technology to do their jobs for them), you can vote against
spending the money.

As for subsidizing rural customers, those people made a choice to live in a
rural area, for whatever reason.  I see no reason to subsidize that choice.
Unless of course they want to pay higher taxes to subsidize the costs for
my living in the city.
