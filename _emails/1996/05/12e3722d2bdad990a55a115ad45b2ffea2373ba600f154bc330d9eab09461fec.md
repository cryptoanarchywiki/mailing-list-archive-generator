The entire organization would clearly have to be double blinded.  If this
can be done for mailing lists (which I believe it can) it can be done for
corporations too.  The real trick is getting the costs of anonymous (and I
mean secure anonymous) communications low enough.

If payment is made weekly, it should be made in advance to an escrow agent
who would issue a certificate that the payment for employee r2dd54 has
been received.  The payment would then not be released to anyone without
the consent of the corporation and the employee.

Obviously the escrow agent would have to be trusted.

This prevents an anonymous employee from running off with money without
working and prevents an anonymous corporation from screwing the employee.

Even if a payment gets hung up in a dispute, it's only for a week.

You could break the payments into monthly, or bi yearly or however you
like.

This is what unemployment is for.  No reported income = no job = get
portions of your previously paid tax back before you die.

In addition, why not exchange virutal cash for spending money offshore and
have it forwarded to you?

It's not hard to hide the kind of small pure cash transactions that day to
day living requires (Food, telephone, etc).  The only problem is the large
purchases which require reportable type transactions.

For these a company running at a constant net operating loss could be
formed to purchase cars for resale (funny how no one ever buys them) and
manage property (which no one seems to ever lease).
