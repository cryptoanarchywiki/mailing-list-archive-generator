    Huh? 'a rather strong tradition of protection of individual privacy'? 
In 
Sweden, for many years  you could (and for all I know, still) go to a 
public
records office and look up all kinds of personal data on anyone, without
restriction - you could, for example, find out your co-workers exact 
salaries if you were curious.

   My understanding is that Sweden's postion vis-a-vis the Internet has
been particularly clueless, with international email technically a crime,
and government officials who regard modems as criminal tools.

   I hope things have improved.
