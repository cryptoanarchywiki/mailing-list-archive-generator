This 'middle-man' remailer... What does it really accomplish? Sure, the
operator is hidden, but that's only because of his/her nym at c2.org...
AFAICS, the 'middle-man' has just taken the liability off himself and put
it on the unhidden remailers. Why not just use the existing unhidden
remailers??? 

I think this is similar to the idea that came up about having some (but
not all) remailers only deliver to other remailers, for use as any link in
a chain except the last link. The operator doesn't have his email address
attached to spam, and there's very little liability because Co$ and other
pressure groups will always(?) go after the last remailer in the chain,
since that's the only one they can know was involved. 

I think the pseudonymously hidden remailer is an interesting idea, but I
don't think it offers anything over the unhidden remailers, since it's
still depending on the unhidden ones.. If you want to aviod liability,
what's wrong with running a remailer that only delivers to other
remailers, as I mentioned above? 

Am I missing something here?
