	I was originally creating this as a list of places for me to look at
for sponsoring a remailer, and then decided that the list might find it useful.
I would find over 25$ a month impractical. However, in the 2nd edition I'll
include http://offshore.com.ai, with a note on the cost (and on Vince Cate's
political orientation.)

	Yes. As I recall, there's supposed to be an ecash library coming out
soon. I trust that someone involved in remailers is planning on making up one
that charges ecash once those facilities are available? There's also the
deposit idea for ones that serve an end-posting function; I didn't have this
in mind when I created the list initially, again.

	Good point. I'll try to look up on the Berne convention.

	I've discussed this somewhat above, but whether one needs to charge
may depend on how one runs the remailer. If it only sends to other known
remailers (ideally only to other mixmaster remailers), and the traffic analysis
defeating features work properly, then it's going to be hard to charge you for
some mail going through the net that may not have even gone through you.
	In other words, we may get a division into two types of remailers:
	A. those that charge, and do send messages other than to other
		remailers; these may also be nym servers demanding a deposit,
		with a confirmation as to who's who via signatures
	B. those that don't charge, and don't send messages other than to
		other anonymous remailers.

	A combination of the above could certainly work, also; just charge for
messages going to other than other remailers.
