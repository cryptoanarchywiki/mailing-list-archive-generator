The ads say they are selling it - that doesn't mean shipping it... yet
at least.  (Note that my employer is a direct competitor of Lucent 
so I have a vested interest in setting the facts straight)

Yes - this is still very much a lab situation only though.
It will be quite a few years before we hit that in real systems.

An OC48 signal (~2.5 Gb/sec) will handle 48 T3's or 48 * 672 voice calls.
Multiply by 8 for 20 Gb/second and you get 258048 voice calls.
Pretty close to 300k I guess.

I don't know that any number fiber cable is "standard" but 
36-fiber cable is not unusual.  To find the capacity of a cable, you
have to cut the number of fibers in half (as you did) because
generally each fiber is used only for a single direction of traffic.
You then have to cut it in half again because phone companies have 
everything redundant.  So, for a connection between two cities,
there are generally 2 cables in different locations (so one backhoe
doesn't get both), with on average only 1/2 the fibers in each carrying 
paying traffic.

I can't vouch much for your cost numbers - other than to apply the 
factor of 2 adjustment noted above.  I would add that much of a 
phone companies cost is in billing and customer service, etc.
Not the cost of installing and maintaining the fiber and equipement.

This is how the smaller carriers buy lots of bandwidth off of the
big guys, and remove all the billing, etc. problems to themselves.
They big guys are still making money selling the bandwidth, and the
little guy makes his profit by selling for slightly less
than the big guy and somehow making his billing, customer service, etc.
cost him less.

Internet telephony should make the use of bandwidth even more
efficient - thereby cutting costs.  The big guys who own
the fibers will still make money - the pipes that carry internet
traffic are still needed.  But the little guys will get squeezed out.
(until they become ISPs ;-).  Internet traffic could theoretically
be carried over this large amount of protection fiber (mentioned above)
that is out there for a much lower marginal cost than the current 
T3 or OC3 pipes that are being used.  The only "problem" being that these
are lower priority channels, so that if a failure occurs anywhere,
the traffic on them is dropped.  Most customers are demanding 
high uptimes so much that the idea of a very lost cost, 
but much less reliable service hasn't caught on yet.
