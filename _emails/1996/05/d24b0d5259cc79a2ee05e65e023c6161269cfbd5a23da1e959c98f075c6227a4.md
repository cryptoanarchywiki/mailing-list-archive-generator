I have a partial implementation of this for Mixmaster if anyone wants to
try integrating it into the main code. It works (or worked) for single
packet messages but I never finished the multi-packet code. Of course, if
Mixmaster is being rewritten anyway then it won't be much use. 

AFAIR it also relies on the 'In-Reply-To:' field in the header working 
correctly.
