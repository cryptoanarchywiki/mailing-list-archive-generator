The fact that I quote Rand occasionnally does not mean that I endorse 
everything she said.  The word "spout" seems to be derogatory here 
and I see nothing that guarantee it.

Some of her ideas did not pass the test of reality, and some other 
did.  But the fact that some did not does not invalidate the other 
that did.
