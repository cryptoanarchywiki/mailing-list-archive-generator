We don't really disagree.  What Black Unicorn writes is quite
correct IF ONE IS CONCERNED WITH LEGAL CORRECTNESS.  Not everyone
on this list could afford to do completely legal international
tax structuring.  I still stand by my statement, however, that
most list members could afford to use offshore techniques.  (If
you have a ton of money, by all means, hire Black Unicorn or
someone similarly situated, to help you with your planning.
Big money is a big target, andy you definitely need to have all
your i's dotted and t's crossed.
