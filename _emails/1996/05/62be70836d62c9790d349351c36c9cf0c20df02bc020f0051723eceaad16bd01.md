They don't want that much information, nor do they really check it;
the big thing they're doing is sending you advertisements
and probably selling your name, but they may have privacy policies.
The big negative about using them as alias servers is that you have
to use _their_ software and dial up to them; you can't get your mail
by POP (though you can argue that it's harder to trace that way),
and you have to use their silly advertisement-displaying user interface
(shades of Prodigy!).  I assume that behind their silly interface
is a standard network protocol, which somebody can decipher and
figure out how to use SLIP or PPP or X.3/X.28/X.29 or whatever instead.
