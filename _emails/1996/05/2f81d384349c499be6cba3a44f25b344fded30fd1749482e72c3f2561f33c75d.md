As I said yesterday, there are in fact people dealing with billions
in all major currencies that keep their money in 64 bit floats. The
precision is far better than anything you can do in 32 bit integers.
Trust me, this is a fact and can easily be proven.

The "get real" was a pun on floats. Many languages, such as Pascal,
calls them real numbers. Sorry I forgot the smiley.

In my client (2.1.5a MT) there is no way to do currency conversion.
If I go to a FIM or DEM merchant I can't buy anything in the store.

This will probably change in the near future when a new client is
released, and then we'll have the question of how to represent these
currencies in one wallet.

What do you think will happen if you have a one italian lira coin and
you try to deposit it with Mark Twain's USD account? With integer
math it won't be pretty.

Maybe you should start looking for it. You'll need it when the lira
arrives...
