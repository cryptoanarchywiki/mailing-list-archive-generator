To those unfamiliar with the issues, ars is not a good example. At first,
it looks like a bunch of louts screaming.

I'd mention alt.revisionism, where anonymity is used and recognized by all
sides, usually responsibly (though that probably wasn't true before I
dropped in). It's the stupid skinheads configuring Netscape with
"anonymous" addresses that bug me; I usually find their real address and
tell them how to get a real remailer or freenet account. 

Of course, to people who don't know what to filter, alt.revisionism also
looks like a bunch of louts screaming.
