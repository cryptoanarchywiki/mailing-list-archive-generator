This is the most concise and logical response yet, to my
suggested answer of "Truth" to Bell's question.  Blanc has
masterfully shown why that dog won't hunt.

Thanks for the compliment, Sandy.

I understood what you meant.   I appreciate the general nature of truth, in spite of the possibilities for misinterpretations of or prevarications from it. 

Jim, a quote for you:

	"We are able to act at all - that is to say, we have the power 
	to order our conduct in such a way that the ends we desire 
	can be attained - only because the phenomena of the world 
	are governed not by arbitrariness, but by laws that we have 
	the capacity to know something about.  If it were otherwise, 
	we should be completely at the mercy of forces that we should 
	be unable to understand." 
				~ Human Action, Ludwig Von Mises

Substitute the word "truth" for "laws" and it makes equal sense.  We would be at the mercy of forces that we could not control, if our perceptions and interpretations could not correspond to the actual, the real, the truth.

(and anyway, what does God have to do with crypto? 
Never mind....)
