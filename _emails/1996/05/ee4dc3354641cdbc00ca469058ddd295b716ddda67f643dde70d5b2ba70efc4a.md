   5-10-96. WaPo:

   "House Panel Approves Intelligence Reforms."

   Reports on the House intelligence committee's differences
   with the Senate and White House reforms. Also, it reports
   on Freeh's testimony yesterday at a hearing about the need
   for new federal laws to protect against economic espionage.
   He cites spying by 23 foreign governments and methods used.

   at PSI's VA switches, so they say (or maybe plummeting
   stock and insider dumps): incoming and outgoing mail oft
   delayed up to 24+.
