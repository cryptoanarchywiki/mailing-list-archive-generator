That's the problem, installing the plugin.

I (and some others, I think) was hoping that it would be possible to build
powerful crypto applets and put them up on web pages.  That way everyone 
with a java enabled copy of Netscape could use a remailer or send crypted 
mail without having to download, install, and configure software.

If people have to download and install a plugin to use a java mixmaster
applet, why not just download and install a native mixmaster client?

Of course there are other reasons to use java -- platform independence,
for example.  But it's the user's ability to download and run applets just
by jumping to a web page that has everyone excited.  With that gone (for 
crypto), java loses a lot of its lustre (again, for crypto work).
