	Hmm... the first (license vs item) could be argued with by that the
remailer operator _is_ sending the recipient a copyrighted work, which the
remailer has - so far as it knows - been given proper permission to choose to
transfer to the recipient.
	The second is more bothersome, and is an instance of the unfortunate
overuse of liability in the American legal system. As you state,

	I would gather that countersuits for violation of a contract - that not
to sue - would not be likely to succeed. Unfortunate.

	A clear reason for demanding that mail come from a recognized remailer
before putting it to an output end. In this case, the ouputting remailer never
has to worry about it - that's the job of the actual primary inputting
remailer.

	The simple way to put this is that juries and, indeed, the voting
population, are completely incompetent to be in power. This is always
something that one should remember, and an excellent argument as to why
democracy is not a good system of government.

	Would also doing a respond-back hold harmless agreement, of the form
perhaps of: "We do our best to guarantee that this system will not be used
illegitimately. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. By responding to
this message and requesting us to send you the information in question, you are
agreeing to hold us harmless." help any? Or would this be seen by the court as
an attempt to reduce liability when the court (incorrectly) believes it should
be assigned?
