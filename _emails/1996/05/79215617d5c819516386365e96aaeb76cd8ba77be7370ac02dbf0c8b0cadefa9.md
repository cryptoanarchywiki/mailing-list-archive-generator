Unless Alice will automatically rotate between some random set
of Bob1, Bob2, Bob3... It also wouldn't be too difficult
to set up a message that goes through several points before
emerging at a randomly-chosen exitpoint, including a
completely independent remailer.

Actually, there's an Idea.  Set up a single address; use added
headers in the style of:

::
Remailers-To-Chain: 7
Remailers-To-Avoid: remailer@nsa.gov
Final-Destination: tcmay@got.net

Each remailer could construct a message that decrements the
remailers counter, preserving the other headers.  The
usual caveat on encrypting at each step would apply; but since
remailers' pubkeys are available, that's a trivial concern.

A lot more could be done with this general concept.  One immediate
problem is that the frontend address is a target, even though
it can't be obviously connected to any objectionable messages.
Packet sniffing is always a concern, etc etc...

Flame away.
