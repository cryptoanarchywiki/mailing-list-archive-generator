True, but if I oppose and you don't, and my opposition results in their 
forced removal from office, what you believe will be irrelevant.

They obtain their salary through theft from taxpayers.  I'd say that's 
plenty of an offense.

Or, at most, an exceedingly minimal one, operated by donation or extremely 
minor tax levels.

But it wouldn't matter.  They wouldn't know who to target, and the people 
wanting to form a state have an inherent disadvantage against those who do 
not:  The act of forming the state identifies them.

How would you distinguish between just some ordinary citizen and somebody 
that ought to be targeted because of opposition to the state?  With my 
system, the latter can be silent and get the job done.

Then there will be a fight, won by the group that isn't publicly recognized. 
 A group trying to form a centralized entity (and force this on others) will 
fail; those opposing it will win.

It doesn't work like that.  The act of formation of a state inevitably calls 
attention to oneself.  The act of opposing that formation does not.  AP is 
"biased," as it were, against centralized, organized political structure 
that arouses the ire of even a tiny fraction of the population.  A person 
who dedicates himself to ELIMINMATING the state, and does so anonymously, is 
difficult or impossible to target.

I don't deny that a group of people can, willingly, form a subset of society 
where they agree to be bound by certain conditions that the rest of society 
does not tolerate.  However, the key word is "willingly."  If that 
mini-state ever becomes abusive of the rights of its own citizens, or 
becomes threatening of any outside individuals, its leaders will be 
targeted, either by its own citizens or those outside who feel threatened.

I have no problem with that.  That's just great.  Arbitrarily serious guilt 
should be followed by arbitrarily harsh punishement, even if it is years or 
decades later.  Resigning is in no way respected by the AP system per se, but it 
_may_ be considered by the average citizen to be a reason for mercy.

No, AP has no inherent ability to punish those who "play unfairly."  
However, the cost to purchase "predictions" (and the number of other 
citizens who share in this cost)  will probably depend substantially on the 
perceived guilt of the target, in the minds of others.  A person who 
resigns, and especially one who did little to directly anger the populace, 
other than to collect a stolen paycheck, is probably fairly safe.  An 
ex-employee of a particularly abusive government agency is, however, far 
more likely to remain  considered a legitimate target by the public.

Perhaps, but the current system does, and even after AP is instituted there 
will still be common criminals to keep down.

No, the donations will be made against those people who are actually seen by 
the people as the real problem.  In an "AP-world," there would be no 
"Islamic leaders" to call for Rushdie's death.  True, if an author like 
Rushdie said or wrote something that really angered a substantial number of 
people, they might individually be aroused enough to target him, but that is 
far less likely than ire directed by an Islamic leader today, I think.

I (and others) have predicted that there will indeed be "court systems" in 
place, although they will be numerous, competing, and voluntary, which will 
turn most offenses into crimes punishable by fines.  That will adjust the 
punishment to the crime, in most people's opinions.

No "values will be protected," except those that the individuals in society 
choose to be protected.

Who is "we"?

Don't call it "murder," then.  It's self-defense, at least by those who use 
it legitimately.

Ultimately, that's the way it's going to happen, UNLESS the society's 
control is waylaid by government.

Yes, that's great.  But I don't think we (the public) should have to depend 
on the good will of the elected officeholder, especially one who DIDN'T make 
such a promise.

But what is the minimum in "minimalist"?  I was a minarchist for a couple of 
decades, because I couldn't think of an intellectually consistent way to get 
rid of the last vestiges of government, permanently.  Now I can.


 The most

Sigh.  I'm afraid that kind of thinking has been obsoleted...

The whole concept of having to maintain "the national defense" is totally 
obsoleted by the stable anarchy formed by AP.  After AP, all defense will be 
local, because no large attacker could survive the "predictions" of the rest 
of the world.

I agree it sounds a bit scary, but that's mainly because it's so different 
from the current system.

Reminds me of the old saying, "Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on 
what to have for dinner."

The problem with the concept of "compromises" is that it assumes that it is 
necessary to make those compromises.


> I personally find socialists endearing and am willing

I don't care what they THINK, but if they try to enforce their society on me 
I'll feel no hesitancy to eliminate them.


> AP will draw

No, it'll make compromises totally unnecessary.

Historically, that has been often true.  But then again, I think the rules 
have changed.  (or will soon change.)
