[stuff i kind of agree with deleted]

I have my own mini-solutions... for personal mail, I use a kill file. 
For Usenet (when I'm really stuck with too much free time and 
actually read it) FreeAgent and Agent have some ignore 
thread/kill-file abilities (my setup only retrieves headers... so I 
have that luxury for now).

How to deal with the problem as an admin is an entirely different 
story. Solutions?
