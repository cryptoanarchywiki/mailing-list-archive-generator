Jackie Speier's at it again!  Now she's proposing AB3320, a bill to regulate
sales of goods and services to protect consumers on the Internet.
It's in its third revision, and much improved, but still obviously
doesn't get it - the bill talks a lot about physical delivery
of services or tangible goods (use or copying of information
appears to fall through the rather wide cracks here)
and providing written notices and toll-free telephone numbers,
not quite realizing that an electronic mail address would do fine.

The original bill was a proposal to require computer BBSs that
charge for their services to register with the State at a cost of $50.
It was marked up into a hybrid bill, and then into current form.

I'm not sure what Assemblymember Speier is trying to accomplish,
but she's clearly thrashing around trying to define it and do
_something_ helpful to consumers.  Those of you in her district may
wish to get in touch with her and help her understand the Net
and electronic commerce and international connectivity and such.
Alternatively, if your Senator or Assemblymember is on the
committee, you may want to talk to him/her.

Here's the current bill status, according to leginfo.

Here's a quote some of you privacy supporters may enjoy....
(The {- -} and {+ +} are some kind of addition/deletion markup.)
