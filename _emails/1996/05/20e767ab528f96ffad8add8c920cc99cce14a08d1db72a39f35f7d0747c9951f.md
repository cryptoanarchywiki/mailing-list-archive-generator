Not with a MITM. Mallet just signs the certificate first and turns it in, 
before the other entity even receives it. The bank has no way to tell 
which of those two certificates would be invalid... and the anonymous 
entity gets screwed. Signed bearer certificates are great for 
non-anonymous communication...
