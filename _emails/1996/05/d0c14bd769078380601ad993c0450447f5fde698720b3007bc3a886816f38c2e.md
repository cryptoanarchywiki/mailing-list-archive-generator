I don't know if Ian ever posted his scheme on cypherpunks? There are some 
obvious approaches that were discussed here about six months ago; they 
 involve collaboration between payer and payee (the payee has to 
supply the payee with the blinded serial numbers, which can then be 
reblinded by the payer for transmission). 

This scheme can't be used with the ecash API, and I believe is not looked 
on kindly when applying for ecash licences. It makes you a lot more 
vulnerable to  traffic analysis
