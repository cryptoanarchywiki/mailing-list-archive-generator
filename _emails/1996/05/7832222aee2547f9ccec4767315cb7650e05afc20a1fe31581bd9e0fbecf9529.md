I'm sure you know the law and practice better, but my insurance seems to
have a "preexisting conditions" clause. Knowingly doing the above
constitutes fraud. (Of course lots of people probably get away with it.)

Moreover, when the insurance company pays out, that ultimately comes out
of premiums. I don't have Huntington's, but I don't mind paying an extra
$X into a risk pool for people with Huntington's because it means I don't
have to submit to genetic screening, either. You don't have to have
something to hide to see it as an invasion of privacy. It's a pool of
consumers establishing preferences, not just individual consumers v. 
producers. The meaning of microeconomics changes as it scales.

[Yawn]

By "fairness" I meant that equal risks should be treated equally. Cost of
disease A = cost of disease B. The detection of predisposition to disease
A is politically feasible, but the same isn't true for disease B. I'd say
you were discriminating against people predisposed to disease A, because
they're paying into the risk pool for B, but B isn't paying into the risk
pool for A.
