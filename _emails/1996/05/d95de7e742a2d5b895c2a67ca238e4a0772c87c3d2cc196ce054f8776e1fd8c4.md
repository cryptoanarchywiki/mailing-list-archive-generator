	The other messages on this appear to be saying about the same thing,
with the exception of this last part. _Except_ for that, the payor/payee
collusion part doesn't appear to be a problem on the anonymnity side of
things. I would guess that Lucky Green's comment was then that there was an
additional complexity for payor and payee.
