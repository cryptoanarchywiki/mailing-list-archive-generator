That's why terrorism is so effective.  It only takes a few pounds of 
Sentex or C-4 to produce millions of dollars of damage.  It only takes 
the T's getting lucky *once* - we have to be lucky *all the time*.

Now, take that scenario and turn it around.  It only takes a little 
effort to frustrate the IRS, the FBI, or whoever your target happens to 
be.  The problem, however, is twofold - (1) the government will play mind 
games on the rest of the population to make you look like a terrorist, or 
whatever turns the populace against you, and (2) the government tends to 
use a sledgehammer to crack a walnut.  They don't care what kind of 
collateral damage they inflict (witness Waco and Ruby Ridge) as long as 
they can make their point.
