	Pointing out encryption, anonymnity, etcetera as means couldn't
hurt...

fellow, with a web address for "Asset Protection & Becoming Judgement Proof."
I'd be interested in a review of it.

Subject: FTC Workshop on Consumer Privacy in Cyberspace


      FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION WORKSHOP ON CONSUMER PRIVACY
              IN CYBERSPACE TO BE HELD IN JUNE 1996

     The Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Education
will hold a public workshop on June 4 and 5 to focus on privacy
issues in the online marketplace.  The development of technologies
such as the Internet and the World Wide Web has allowed online
businesses to collect and use personal information about consumers,
often without consumers' knowledge or consent.  The workshop
will examine consumer privacy issues in this new marketplace,
consumer and business education about the use of personal
information online, and ways to enhance the growth of the online
marketplace by fostering consumer confidence. 
     Workshop topics will include the use of consumer information,
the use of medical and financial information online, the collection
and use of information about children, electronic approaches to
protecting consumer privacy online, and the European Union's
directive on the protection of personal data.
     The workshop will be open to the public and will be held on
June 4, 1996 from 9:00AM to 5:00PM in Room 432 of the FTC
headquarters building, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., in
Washington, D.C.  On June 5, 1996 the workshop will be held from
9:00AM to 12:30PM in Room 332 of the FTC headquarters building.  
     The Bureau invites representatives of consumer groups,
industry, government agencies, and other groups to take part in the
workshop.  Any person wishing to be considered for participation in
the public workshop must file a written request, on or before May
24, 1996, to Martha Landesberg, Division of Credit Practices,
Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission,
Washington, DC 20580.
