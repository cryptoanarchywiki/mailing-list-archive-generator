Not at the moment. It was only banned in one state(can't remember which one)
and that ban was lifted some time ago.

It was tried, but didn't work. The final court ruling was that Australian
Government wasn't allowed to decide what did or didn't constitute a genuine
religious practice. $cientology can charge what it likes.

And the religion cover let them skip away unharmed. The Church's "benefits"
are spiritual in nature(allegedly) and therefore not subject to medical
regulations.

Now to try to get this back on-topic, there was one NOTS document which was
posted anonymously before the whole pack made it to
alt.religion.scientology. It described a process(or "ritual" if you prefer)
designed to help _physical_ affliction. It _may_ violate an FDA ruling
prohibiting the Church from practising medicine. It is _definitely_ a
violation of copyright to post it and one person, Keith Henson, is getting
sued for quoting it. Now, was sending this NOTS document through an
anonymous remailer a good or a bad thing to do?
