There are a couple of different ways that a remailer can be used to support
mail-to-news.  The easy way to block binary posts, is to scan the first few
lines of the message for "begin xxx pic.jpg" and it could also scan for
base64.  Also, messages that are sent to a newsgroup could have a maximum
length.

One way that mail-to-news works, is that the message has newsgroup headers and
it is directly passed to inews for posting.  In this case, the headers could
be scanned for any binary newsgroups.  If mail2news software is being used
which creates a mailing alias for each newsgroup, then the e-mail addresses
of all the binary newsgroups could be placed on the block list.  Unfortunately,
you do need root access to set up such an alias.

If you don't have root access, then grepping the newsgroups header for binary
newsgroups before piping the message to inews is probably the best way.
