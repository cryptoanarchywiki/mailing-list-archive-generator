Since I use UNIX, I have set up the mailing program so that it actually takes
extra effort to not sign something.  I have nothing to lose by signing my
e-mail messages.  Yes, I know that not everyone in the world uses UNIX and
I don't know if there is a transparent mailing interface for Windoze or
Macintosh.  As for encryption, I encrypt a lot of my messages because if I
only encrypted "secret" messages, that would automatically draw suspicion
to every encrypted message that I send.  I also always use ssh to log into my
UNIX shell account.  I know the probability of someone intercepting my
password is low, but again I have nothing to lose.

As I said above, there is plenty of integration between PGP and UNIX mailers,
but such is not the case for Windoze and Macintosh.
