	Hmm.... a useful distinction in this is between multiple paths with
no common elements except the beginning and end and ones with common elements.
The sections of the ones with common elements that have no common elements
can probably be treated as a subset of the larger path - a virtual link, if
you will - with its values (trustworthiness et al) determined by the paths
contained within it.

	Milgram? Thanks, I'll check for that name.

	I'm not disputing that... just that you don't need to be able to go
through the web to reach everyone who's got a key. Admittedly, the subsection
of people who have keys are more likely (through being more technologically
sophisticated et al, on average) to be useful to contact than those who don't.
