	Can one use a web-of-trust for S/MIME, for the cases when a structured
hierarchy is exactly the _wrong_ thing to use? I'd think so, but I don't know
anything about it.

	A public breaking of some S/MIME messages would work to discourage
this unsafe mechanism. One wonders if PGP Inc. could sponsor some variety of
contest?
