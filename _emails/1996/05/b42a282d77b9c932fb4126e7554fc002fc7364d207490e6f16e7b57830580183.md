	Yes... but he does appear to keep track of the log file; he had up the
name of someone who allegedly misused it a few days ago. He states:
	"If this remailer is used for something illegal, it can be traced.
Also, if people use it to insult me, I will probably want to look in the logs
and find out who it is!"
