Really hard to get courts to pay attention to these.
Signing away the right to process is a thorny thing.

Remailers on the attack points (first in chain, last in chain) simply MUST
be disposable as tissue.  They must be run as anonymously as possible,
with as little connection to the ISP's assets as possible and immediately
disposable.  They must be easy to set up, runable without root and there
must be a much more efficent tracking mechanism.  (Mr. Levin has done a
terrific job, but even more needs to be done).

This wanton suing, as I think we all know, is an abuse of the copyright
protections and their intent.  The only way to really deal with it is make
remailers unassailable.  Doing that with tricky dick type legal arguments
will, in my view, eventually fail.

It only takes ONE operator to get a tiny ($2500-$10,000) fine or judgement
and that will be the end of most of the mailers.  Poof.

This we cannot allow.

I wouldn't go this far.  It is an excellent argument for picking juries
that are experts with regard to the subject at hand.

In my view trying to balance bias rather than eliminate it is much more
effective.

If harassing mail is the issue, I can see how this might help in terms of
image.  I don't think its a complete solution however.

Again, I think the attack points have to be protected.
