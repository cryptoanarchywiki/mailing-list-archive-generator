	Oof... I see the problem. No, it's not you, it's them. I've forgotten
exactly what claims RSA has; patent (when does it expire?), copyright (can
it be rewritten), or trade secret (wasn't it broken?)? Without some form of
getting around this (or licensing from them), usage for pay will be kind of
difficult.
