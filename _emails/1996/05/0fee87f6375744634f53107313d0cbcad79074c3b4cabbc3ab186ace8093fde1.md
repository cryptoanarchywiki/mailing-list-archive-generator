How would you know that the message you received is actually from them? I
don't see how this would really help.

I like the "knock-knock" approach, though it would of necessity impose
load. If someone has an anonymous message waiting, send them a simple note
with instructions on how to retrieve it.

 From: Anonymous Remailer <hfinney@shell.portal.com>
 To: random person <somebody@there.com>
 
 An anonymous message is waiting for you. If you wish to receive this
 message, simply send an email message with [some unique string, maybe an
 MD5 hash of the actual message] in the body of a message to
 hfinney@shell.portal.com. The simplest way to do this is to reply to this
 message, quoting this text. 

I certainly think that limiting newsgroup posting would be prudent. It's
inexcusable that it's possible to use anonymous remailers to post
*forgeries* (see the smoking flames cross-posted to alt.syntax.tactical).
