What!!!!

Now you tell me, after I spent all that money on a "fire and forget" contract!

Well, Jim, all I can say is keep your head down. Sorry!

(Seriously, I knew the "Jim Ray wrote" must've been a misattribution, as
that is not the kind of stuff Jim writes.)

(Oh, and the "fire and forget" contract assassins were well-described by
William Gibson in, I believe, "Count Zero.")

Boycott "Big Brother Inside" software!
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
