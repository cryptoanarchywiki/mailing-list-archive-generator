Yup.  It's a classic Unix tools approach - let each piece do what it
does best, and use a standard simple interface between tools.
You don't need to write "catblock", though - there's the "dd" command
designed for just such applications (well, designed for the way
those applications looked 20 years ago, when you needed to do things
like EBCDIC conversion and line-length padding to deal with IBM tapes,
and the syntax has a certain evil OS360 JCL look to it :-)
Newer versions may handle multiple tapes a bit better.
