I disagree.  The key is prior or on site clearing.  Anonymous businesses
will have to depend more on reputation, and even reputation has its limits
when it comes to parties that obviously have no accountabilty at all.

Participants in such a market will have to be wary of the "last shot" or
"last round" problem.  (Specifically that one party to the transaction may
no longer wish to participate in the market, and not need to and thus is
free to screw the market, "cash in" his reputation and retire on the
proceeds as a result.

Still, escrows or multiple escrows will be the answer here.

Now, tell me how AP is a solution if everyone in the corporation is double
blinded?  Who do anonymous parties put out betting pools on?

[As AP has been discredited in this application, your argument for it is
deleted.]

And so?  Because I possess or have received cash from someone does not
mean that it is mine, nor that I earned it, nor that I am not merely
holding it, nor that I am not acting as trustee.

Income tax and currency taxes depend on realization events.  Even in the
strictest sense, realization is a thin and vague concept.

Your only remaining option is to tax possession of currency.  Good luck.
