If the payor is not colluding, then the payee will immediately discover
he has not been paid, because the checksums are wrong, and his software
says "bad payment"

If the payor is colluding, then no matter what he reveals to the bank,
the bank cannot discover the payee.  Note that with payee anonymity,
the payee does not have to promptly check in his money, so the bank
has no hope of narrowing the search by coincidence in time.

But if the payee is colluding, then the payor can be detected by 
coincidence in time.
