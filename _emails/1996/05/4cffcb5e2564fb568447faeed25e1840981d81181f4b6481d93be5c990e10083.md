I don't see that this is necessarily true for information any more than it
is property. Property can be bought, sold, traded, given away, made...but it
can also be stolen. Just as I have a right to complain if you walk off with
my couch without my permission, so if you walk off with data on my blood
chemistry or credit history without my permission.
