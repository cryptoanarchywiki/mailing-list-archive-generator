! 	I was thinking about this last night, hence my question about
! running mixmaster under Xenix (or minux for that matter).
! 
! 	How about this as an idea:
! 
! 	Get a few (3 to 5) accounts in a high density market (i.e. lots of
! ISP's locally) set up a unix machine on a cheap machine. Have the anon
! messages get sent to the pop accounts. Once an hour (or less depending on
! budget) have the unix box poll the different pop accounts mix the messages
! and resend them the next hour. 

YES YES YES!!!!!!
SLIP/PPP/SHELL IT DOESN'T MATTER, DOWNLOAD MAIL, PROCESS, UPLOAD, MAIL, POST!!!!!
LINUX MODEM/CUA1 OR SLIP/PPP!!!!!!!!
PAID WITH *FAKE* NAME/ADDRESS WITH POSTAL MONEY ORDER!!!!!!
I SUCK, I DON'T CODE!!!!!!
IF THEY WONT GIVE YOU "FROM: " AND 50 POSTS/500 EMAILS A DAY GET ONE THAT WILL!!!!!!
THIS IS A CYPHER EMERGENCY!!!!!!!!
WE NEED 1,000 SERVERS F A S T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
POSTAL COUPONS AND FOREIGN ACCOUNTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WE NEED SERVERS NOT CLIENTS!!!!!!!

! 	This could be further obfuscated by batching the messages up and
! posting a whole chunk of messages to a different similar remailer else
! where, or by just plopping an encrypted tar'd file on a ftp site where
! another remailer grabs them and splits and remails them.

THE USER/CLIENT DOES THIS SORT OF STUFF!!!!!!!!!!!!
WE DON'T NEED ANYTHING BUT 1,000 WORLD HACKTIC STYLE REMAILERS!!!!!!!!!!!
