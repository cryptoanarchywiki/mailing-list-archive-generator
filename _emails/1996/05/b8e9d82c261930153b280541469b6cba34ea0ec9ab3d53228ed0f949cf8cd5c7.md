	I am curious as to what systems these throw-away accounts are on; they
would appear to be good output systems for ephemeral remailer endpoints.
Admittedly, I suspect that this will take ecash remailers unless they're all
through systems like aol.com that accept credit cards with inadequate
verification (from what I know, check digit(s) only).
