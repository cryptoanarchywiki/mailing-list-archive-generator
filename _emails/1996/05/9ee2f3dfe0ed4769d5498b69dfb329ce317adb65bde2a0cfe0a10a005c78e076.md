Irrelevant to AP since nobody knows anybody, nor what anybody else 
do.

Again, irrelevant to AP.  This scheme suppose some clan against 
another (the govt).  Re-read Jim Bell's essay and you'll realize that 
it wouldn't work that way at all.

Not in AP.  Because the aim when using AP against government or any 
other entity is not to get rid of it by killing it's members, but 
rather to get rid of it by scaring any individual that would 
participate to it.

<Lots of stuff absolutely irrelevant to AP deleted>.  

Re-read the essay again.

Are you saying that problems are difficults to identify?

To Cypherpunks: I did not write the following paragraph.  It was
probably from Jim Bell, but I only guess.  

To: Pat Trainor: Ask Jim Bell to send you his paper. I'm
sure he will do it wilfully.
