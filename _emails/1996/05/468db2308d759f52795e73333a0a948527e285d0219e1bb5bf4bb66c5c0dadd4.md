One should also note that the surplus beyond subsistence was much smaller
at that time. A more useful figure might be the percent tax on surplus. If
the serf was taxed at 10%, but only had a 5% surplus above survival needs,
then he was in a difficult position. Unfortunately I see no chance of an
agreement on how to define surplus.
