1)  Read as wide a variety of the stuff out there you can 
    (even the books by "dangerous crackpots").  
2)  Take a vacation to a tax haven you like because of what
    you've read about it.
3)  Open a bank account with an established bank.
4)  Ask your banker to recommend a trustworthy lawyer.
5)  Tell the lawyer what you want to accomplish and do
    what he or she says, if it makes sense to you.
6)  DON'T talk to anyone else--especially in your home
    country--about what you have done, are doing or
    are planning to do.
7)  As your resources increase, repeat steps 2-5 in 
    other tax havens.  Don't put all your eggs in one
    basket if you have enough to spread around.

8)  Send me $1000.  If you follow my steps 1-7, you will
    save many times that amount.
