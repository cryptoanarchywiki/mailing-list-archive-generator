If they lose they are almost certain to appeal both cases.  If they don't 
appeal a loss, it means that plaintiffs won, i.e. get what they asked 
for.  The government isn't going to sit still for that while another case 
is proceeding.

No problem with two sides each appealing different verdicts to the 
supreme court.  That's what it's for - to sort things out and make the 
circuits consistent.

Sorry, I don't recall the language well enough and I'm on the road.  I 
thought it went to the Supremes no mater what; that's the usual practice, 
but i could be wrong.   there is a procedure for by-passing the Court of 
Appeal in urgent cases.  Also, if one case is on a slow track and the 
other one is on a fast track, there are procedures for getting involved, 
at least as amici, in the fast track case.
