Personally, I'm not terribly worried by such concentrations (for reasons
I'll mention at the end).

But I'll note that Eric Fair's recent post described the far-from-geodesic
traffic situation, with a relatively small number of "super-nodes" (like
"MAE-West" and her sisters) handling huge fractions of traffic. These
super-nodes are obvious points of attack (in the nuclear war--or
terrorist--scenario oft-cited as the motivation for packet-switching) and
lessen the "geodesic" nature of the Net.

Economies of scale may be pushing us away from the "full-distributed"
geodesic nature toward super-nodes.

The reason I am not really too worried is that encryption and remailers
allow a kind of "meta-geodesic" network to be (virtually) layered on top of
the physical network.

(In the famous network hierarchy of network levels, it seems we can add a
new level.)
