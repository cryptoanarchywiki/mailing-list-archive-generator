I'd like to hear more about the timeline.  From a snippet I heard yesterday, 
he telephoned his wife and said he'd be renting a canoe.  Okay, who and why 
did "they" visit a cabin (?) to find him? (If somebody called me from a 
cabin, and he had a telephone, I would not consider his failure to later 
answer the phone to be particularly suspicious...)  

 And one version I heard said that the canoe was at the cabin.  How often do 
fatal canoe accidents occur what might have been a few feet from shore?  
(You can't sink a modern canoe, especially a rental, because they have 
floats under the seats to prevent this.)   We can't tell, because the 
information being released is so sparse.

Somebody's not telling us the whole story.
