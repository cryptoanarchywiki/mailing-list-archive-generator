   5-19-96. WaPo: 
 
   "From Out Of the Shadows." Book review. 
 
   Spies Without Cloaks: The KGB's Successors 
   By Amy Knight 
   Princeton University Press. 318 pp. $24.95 
 
      Knight suggests that Russia's new security forces are 
      not only continuing the same kinds of skulduggery as 
      they undertook in the past but are now also expertly 
      manipulating public opinion in Russia and the rest of 
      the world to obscure and disguise what they do. 
 
      What Knight suggests is that the old client-master 
      relationship between Russia's elite and the KGB has not 
      only been reversed but may even have vanished, because 
      these "children of the KGB" have subsumed large chunks 
      of Russia's economy and government. 
 
      If *Spies Without Cloaks* is correct, much of Russia 
      today is little more than a mutant KGB, the communist 
      ideology it once served now replaced by ruthless 
      devotion to great-power politics and bottom-line 
      capitalism. 
 
   The book is worth reading for its applicability to the 
   transformation of the US and international intelligence 
   "communities" into free-market racketeering of espionage 
   technologies and expertise and insider secrets -- as WaPo 
   reported May 2 on high-tech intel patrons Perry and Deutch.
