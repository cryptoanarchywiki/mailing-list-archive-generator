I don't have any hints, but I think people need to be aware up front
that calling native code from a Java applet disables
any security that might otherwise be enforced for the applet.  

It's OK to do this, as long as you understand up front how things work. 
One of the restrictions on applets is that they can't load DLLs or .so's. 
People get around that restriction by choosing to install a DLL on the
local machine in such a way that the applet can invoke methods defined in
that DLL (or .so) By choosing to do that, they're deliberately saying
"it's OK, I understand this native method might do anything at all on the
machine and it's OK by me"
