With regards to filling in your own card, what about using a disappearing 
ink?? Then your prints would disappear! You could even do your name, 
right infront of them, and it would disappear, leaving these anynonomous 
prints behind!!

Or you could make an inkpad that is damp with sodium hydroxide (lye) 
instead of ink.  That way, you could lightly roll your fingers in it, 
like it was ink, and then wait a minute, and wipe it off.  That way, the 
only skin being eaten away, would be the ridges of the fingerprints.  Do 
this enought times, and the rigdes will end up the same height as the 
valleys, and will then essentially be flat.

Just a thought, but I'd like to hear if anyone would think either ideas 
would work.
