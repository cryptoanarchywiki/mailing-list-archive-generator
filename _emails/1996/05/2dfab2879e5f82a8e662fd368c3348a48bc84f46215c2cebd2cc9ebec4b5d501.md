For example, see http://www.digicrime.com/id.html . I believe they got
these certificates using the Web, rather than e-mail.

I think with e-mail, you'd actually have to be running a packet sniffer
or doing an active attack such as DNS spoofing. However, the Web is
much, much more convenient.

In any case, the page I referenced above is worthwhile reading.
