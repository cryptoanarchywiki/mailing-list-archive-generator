Couple quick things:

At 11:46 AM 5/9/96 -0700, you wrote:
>I don't like the use of the term "objective" here. (I object!!)

No, it isn't the best term, there is some bias which can be an issue with
dealing with this at the international level, but I think there are
solutions to that...

>a judgement like "child approved" is more subjective than "sex: moderate",
>but they are both value judgements.

        It doesn't even say "sex: moderate", but "(s 3)", and then the
parent can consult a chart that is a summary of the questions that directly
ask about the content:


		VIOLENCE	
	
ALL (0)  HARMLESS CONFLICT;  SOME DAMAGE TO OBJECTS
1        CREATURES INJURED OR KILLED; DAMAGE TO OBJECTS; FIGHTING
2        HUMANS INJURED OR KILLED WITH SMALL AMOUNT OF BLOOD
3        HUMANS INJURED OR KILLED, BLOOD AND GORE
4        HUMANS INJURED OR KILLED, BLOOD AND GORE	
         WANTON AND GRATUITOUS VIOLENCE TORTURE; RAPE

So we can argue about "objective," but this is _atleast_ very
"non-arbitrary" and the process (if people are non-malicious) is deterministic.

        This is a significant issue.

        Try it for your own page and see!

        People who misuse the system can be fined. (By using the system one
also has to "AGREE"). However, the status of this contract is up at grabs
IMHO since they relied on trade mark to enforce their system (the pic on a
box). Now, gifs and the like (banners) may still be of issue, but the real
meat here is a system (s 3 l 2 v 0), there is no IP protection for this, and
if there aren't signatures, this can be a serious problem.

>creator, as it should be. (in my view ratings and the content should

        I see it as an author provided a value added service to his content
same as anyone else.
