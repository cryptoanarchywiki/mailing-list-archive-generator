	Well, that would depend on the traffic analysis defeating features
not working right. Admittedly, for the next-to-last or so remailer, they
may not work well enough anyway... but proof beyond a reasonable doubt would
be difficult. Civil suits unfortunately don't follow that standard (even for
the punishment done through punitive damages), but they do require some proof.
