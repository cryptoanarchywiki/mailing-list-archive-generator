He who wants an Other Guy to certify him as a good guy is a supplicant. If 
the Other Guy wants you to get naked and stand on your hands in front of 
the Dutch Queen's front lawn, then that's their rule and you make your 
choice about obeying.

If the Other Guy wants your fingerprints so he can check whether you're 
escaped from prison for a mail fraud conviction, well: that's their rule.
If you want the Other Guy to certify your good character, then give your 
fingerprints. If you don't like it, then ply your trade without their 
peice of paper. You don't have a God-given right to have the peice of paper.

Your customers and clients can decide if they still want to hire you.
