The problem is entering this "Web of trust".  You have to know someone who
is already in The Web in order to start signing your keys.  I don't know
anyone around here who uses PGP but me.  That's why I've been getting
keys off of this list.  Gotta start somewhere, however, I feel that this 
is a very shaky way to start.

I agree that once the WOT is set up, everything should work hunky dory, but
introducing yourself into this web isn't an easy thing.  Since we know that
the keyservers aren't bulletproof, how many keys do I grab from there in 
order to start my keyring?  One?  Ten?  500?  Statistically speaking, how 
many of those have been compromised and can no longer be trusted?

That's what I'm trying to do.  Maybe I'm just looking at it all backwards 
or something, but it's something I've been thinking about since I've been 
collecting keys lately.
