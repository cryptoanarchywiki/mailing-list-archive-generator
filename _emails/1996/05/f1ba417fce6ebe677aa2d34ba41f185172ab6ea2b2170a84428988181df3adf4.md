Hmm... This person doesn't seem to realize the size of the internet, or
it's decentralized nature. 

I wouldn't worry about this guy. Even if such a list existed, he wouldn't
know what to do with it. 

"C:\>type isplist.txt"... heheh... :)


(Yes, I know some people compile lists of ISPs, but those lists cover 
only the tip of the iceburg. And yes, I also know that the root 
nameservers have massive databases, but they don't provide much info 
beyond the domain names and IP addresses.)
