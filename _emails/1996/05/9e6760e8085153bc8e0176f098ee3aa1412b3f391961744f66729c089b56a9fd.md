Look at the signators and judge for your self. When I look at the people I
trust through one level of introducer, I find I have a very high degree of
confidence in their identities. Two introducers out, it still looks fairly
good. I have not looked farther than that. It is the limit of my trust.

In many ways it is easier to establish the authenticity of a pseudonym than
a verinym. The only question with a pseudonym is whether the nym who posts
is the same nym who posted last time, and the time before that. If, over
the course of a year or two, there are no attempts to spoof the pseudonym,
then the key will have become well connected with the nym. That is all that
matters. Even if a "Sameer" has posted for years, I still have to worry if
the person's real name is Sameer (given the current understanding of the
meaning of a signature on a key).

I once refused to sign a key because I thought the driver's license was
forged, but I would be likely to accept a better forgery at authentic. I am
at least as confident of the identity of Uni as I am of many of the other
keys I have signed. The only ones I have more confidence in are those of
long time close friends, and family.
