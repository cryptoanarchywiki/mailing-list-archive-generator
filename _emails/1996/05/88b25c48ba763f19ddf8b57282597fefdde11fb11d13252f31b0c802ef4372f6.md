        I would agree the questions seem too video game orientated, and I
don't like some of the questions either. However, it is a fair effort, and I
don't think if something is questionable (for instance, someone errs by
labeling someone that is 18 years old as a teenager) the whole system falls
to pieces. Or some crucial piece of information on my home page, that some
child might have seen, but won't be seen because I labeled a character in
one of my stories as a teenager even if he/she was a teenager.
        I'm sure this is something that could go on for a very long time in
some cypherpunk thread (something I'm not interested in argueing about), but
there is no such thing as a perfectly objective or unbiased system. For
instance, I don't like the distinctions other systems make for
homosexuality, but I also understand some parents may wish to screen on it...
