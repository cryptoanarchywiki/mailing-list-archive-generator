	This is interesting in light of social networks analysis as applied
to the web of trust (one interesting web-reference on such analysis is at
http://www.mpi-fg-koeln.mpg.de/~lk/netvis.html; as well as some examples - use
a graphics-capable web browser - it has some links to a FTP site with
programs). One method of such analysis uses what is sometimes called "gravity;"
under it, positions move to be close to those to which they are linked. This
can be one-way or two-way; the above fact may imply that signing someone's key
should move one closer to that person - and not the other way around. Of
course, when analyzing the result, one should keep in mind that one may not
have beneficial intent when signing a key; LD's signatures are examples. Thus,
closeness on such a network may imply a high degree of relationship, but not
a high degree of _positive_ relationship.
