   From:  Ed Roback, NIST 
 
   Subject:  Release of DRAFT Key Escrow Paper 
 
   FYI, today the Interagency Working Group (IWG) on 
   Cryptography Policy released a DRAFT paper entitled 
   "Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public Safety in 
   the Global Information Infrastructure." 
 
   The DRAFT paper discusses a voluntary draft key management 
   infrastructure, supported by private sector key management 
   organizations, that would permit users and manufacturers 
   free choice of encryption algorithms, facilitate 
   international interoperability, preserve law enforcement 
   access, and, most importantly, provide strong system 
   security and integrity.  FYI, the paper was released by the 
   IWG co-chairs Ed Appel (NSC) and Bruce McConnell (OMB). 
 
   Comments on the draft paper are being solicited.  No 
   deadline is specified.   
 
   At present, I do not have an electronic copy of the draft 
   (25 pp).  Copies are available through the OMB publications 
   office at 202-395-7332.  I anticipate that the document 
   will soon be available widely on the net and will forward 
   you a web address when available.
