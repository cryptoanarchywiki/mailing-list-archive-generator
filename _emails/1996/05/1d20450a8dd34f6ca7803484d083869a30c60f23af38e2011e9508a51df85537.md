The Python programming language has built-in support for multiple bignum  
packages (including the GNU MPZ library).  It also has MD5 built-in.  Andrew  
Kuchling also has written a nice crypto package that gives you access to a  
lot of good crypto primitives.  The language was written in the Netherlands,  
is free to use for any purpose (commercial or otherwise), easily runs on  
EVERYTHING (Mac, DOS, Windoze, NT, just about any flavor of unix, etc...), is  
embeddable, and has a Nutshell book about to be published.  Check it out...
