     Please post widely.

     To whom it may concern:

     The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the
     National Research Council (NRC) has completed a congressionally
     mandated study of national cryptography policy.  The final report,
     Cryptography's Role in Securing the Information Society, will be
     released to the public on May 30, 1996 at a public briefing.  A large
     number of the authoring committee members will attend.

     The public briefing will take place in the Main Lounge of the National
     Press Club, 14th and F Streets, N.W., Washington, D.C., from 1:00 PM
     to 3:00 PM, on Thursday, May 30, 1996. Committee members will respond
     to questions from attendees, and a limited number of pre-publication
     copies of the report will be available at that time.  By the close of
     business on May 30, a summary of the report will be made available
     through http://www2.nas.edu/cstbweb; the full publication will be made
     available when final printed copies of the book are available
     (probably around the beginning of August).

     The committee also intends to conduct a second public briefing on the
     report in
     Menlo Park, California at SRI International.  The briefing will be
     held in the Auditorium of the International Building from 10 to 11 am
     on  Wednesday, June.5.  The address is 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo
     Park, California, 94025.  For more information about the briefing at
     SRI, contact Alice Galloway at 415-859-2711
     (alice_galloway@qm.sri.com).

     If you have suggestions about other places that the committee should
     offer a public briefing, please let me know (crypto@nas.edu or
     202-334-2605).

     If you wish to be kept informed of various other public activities
     regarding dissemination of this report, you can sign up for an e-mail
     list by visiting the web page

     I apologize to you for the short notice on this invitation, but hope
     that you will be able to attend.
