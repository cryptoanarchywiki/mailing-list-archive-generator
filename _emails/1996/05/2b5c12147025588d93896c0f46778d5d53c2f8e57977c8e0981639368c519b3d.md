So far, I've seen DES software from a couple of U.S. companies. The question
is "Is it the U.S. domestic DES or "export flavored" DES? As for the hardware,
would'nt it be inconsistant if the DES supplied is the Domestic DES?

I know DES as a subject here is one big YAWN, but for guys like us in the
Asia, it's not. Why? 'Cause the US crypto companies here in Asia keep telling 
us about how good and wonderful and secure DES is, and that it is THE standard
used by the American Banking Association.

whether it's been broken, URLs..ect...

Thanks.
