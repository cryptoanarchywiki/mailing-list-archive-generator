I think that Ed Carp recognizes that these caveats were somewhat valid based 
on a pre-Internet era, when control of news and information was relatively 
centralized in newspapers and TV networks.  Then, you were told what to 
think (although it wasn't quite phrased this way) and few people got an 
alternative story.   But as you correctly point out, it is getting harder to 
pull the wool over the eyes of the public when they can get alternative 
information.

I don't think anybody in the media is going to have the guts to stick with 
the government as it sinks into the depths, torpedoed by its own 
technological inventions.  The big names can just resign and keep their 
wealth; the small fish have no long-term credibility or hope to achieve the 
levels of their predecessors.

I expect that few government workers have any idea how dangerous the net is 
going to be to them in the next few years.  The various proposals we've been 
seeing, such as Clipper and others, are probably the product of a very few 
strategists who began worrying in the early 1990's about the fate of 
centralized government systems.  It will be interesting, someday, to talk to 
these people who monitor us, and ask them when they thought their position 
was hopeless.

I understand your...uh...caution.  But as scary as it may be to "us," it's 
going to be even more terrifying to those it is likely to eliminate.  Sort 
of the difference between two parachute jumps:  With and without a parachute!
