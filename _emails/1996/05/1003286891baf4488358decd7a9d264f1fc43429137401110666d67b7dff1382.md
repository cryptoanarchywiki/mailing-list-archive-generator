If all you need to do is beat the cost of commuting 20 miles/day, no problem.

You could require daily payment and forgo the escrow agent.  (Assuming you
are willing to risk a day's pay as an experiment in reputation.)  Note that
AP won't work if everyone is anonymous because you won't have a target.


What may be a problem for such a company is a social problem.  All the
creative groups I have worked with have had close personal relations. 
(Although they have not had wide agreement on significant non-work
subjects!)  I don't know if good, creative, group-produced products can be
built without such a relationship.  Does anyone know of an example of such
a product from an "anonymous" environment?
