I was offline for the Memorial Day weekend, and I'm hundreds of messages 
behind on cypherpunks, so ignore this if it's redundant...

But anyway, a reminder:

The National Research Council's report on crypto policy will be unveiled
tomorrow at the National Press Club at 1 pm in Washington, DC. I'm going
to try my best to be there. 

>From their web page at <http://www2.nas.edu/cstbweb/>:

   The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the
   National Research Council (NRC) has completed a congressionally
   mandated study of national cryptography policy. The final report,
   Cryptography's Role in Securing the Information Society, will be
   released to the public on May 30, 1996 at a public briefing. A large
   number of the authoring committee members will attend.

   The public briefing will take place in the Main Lounge of the National
   Press Club, 14th and F Streets, N.W., Washington, D.C., from 1:00 PM
   to 3:00 PM, on Thursday, May 30, 1996. Committee members will respond
   to questions from attendees, and a limited number of pre-publication
   copies of the report will be available at that time. By the close of
   business on May 30, a summary of the report will be made available
   through this web page; the full publication will be made available
   when final printed copies of the book are available (probably around
   the beginning of August).

   The committee also intends to conduct a second public briefing on the
   report in
   Menlo Park, California at SRI International. The briefing will be held
   in the Auditorium of the International Building from 10 to 11 am on
   Wednesday, June.5. The address is 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park,
   California, 94025. For more information about the briefing at SRI,
   contact Alice Galloway at 415-859-2711 (alice_galloway@qm.sri.com).
