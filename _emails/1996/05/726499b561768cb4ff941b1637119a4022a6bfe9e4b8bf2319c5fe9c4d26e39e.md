To determine key validity, you do have to consider all paths.  If a
single trusted path to the bad key exists, the attacker wins.

Milgram's "small world" experiments used a much looser sort of "link"
than we want here.  It would be certainly interesting to know how
large a difference this makes.

Gee, let me guess which group you're in... I'll go with "people I want
to talk to" versus "people I don't want to talk to", thanks.

It's true that you don't need to talk to everybody.  The problem is
that I might want to talk to people whom I don't know personally, but
know by reputation, or by function ("DEA Rat Hotline" -- well, maybe
not).
