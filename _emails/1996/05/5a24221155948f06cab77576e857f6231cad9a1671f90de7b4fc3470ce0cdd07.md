(1) 27 REPRESENTATIVES URGE PRESIDENT CLINTON TO ABANDON KEY-ESCROW POLICY

A bi-partisan group of 27 Congressmen, led by Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA)
and Tom Campbell (R-CA) on Wednesday (5/15) sent a letter to President
Clinton urging the President to abandon the Administration's key-escrow
encryption proposal and "instead immediately liberalize export controls on
non-key escrow encryption technology."

Expressing "serious concerns" about the impact of current U.S. encryption
policy on individual privacy and US competitiveness, the bi-partisan group
wrote: "The ability of companies and individuals to ensure that the
information they send over communications and computer networks is secure
is a prerequisite to exploiting the potential of the Global Information
Infrastructure."

The letter was signed by several prominent members from both parties,
including Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Tom Campbell (R-CA), Anna Eshoo (D-CA),
Rick Boucher (D-VA), Bob Barr (R-GA), Pat Schroeder (D-CO), Carlos
Moorehead (R-CA), and 20 other members.

The bi-partisan call to President Clinton to abandon the Administration's
key escrow policy is yet another encouraging sign of increasingly strong
Congressional support for reform of US encryption policy.  Congress is
currently considering several bills designed to encourage the widespread
availability privacy-protecting technologies for the Internet by lifting
export controls on strong encryption:

* HR 3011, the "Security and Freedom Through Encryption (SAFE) Act of
  1996", sponsored by over 30 members including  Reps Goodlatte (R-VA),
  Campbell (R-CA), Eshoo (D-CA), Boucher (D-VA).

* S. 1726, the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (Pro-
  CODE) act of 1996, sponsored by Senators Burns (R-MT), Leahy (D-VT),
  Pressler (R-SD), Dole (R-KS), Wyden (D-OR), and Murray (D-WA)

* S. 1587, the "Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996", also
  sponsored by Senators Burns and Leahy.

Hearings on HR 3011 (Rep Goodlatte's bill) and the Burns/Leahy S. 1726
(Pro-CODE) are expected in June.

INTERNET SECURITY DAY - A NATIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE NEED TO REFORM US
ENCRYPTION POLICY

In July, CDT and over 25 other organizations will hold a daylong education
event in California's Silicon Valley in July. The "Internet Security Day"
will bring together industry leaders, members of Congress, encryption
experts, and others to discuss the need to reform US encryption policy.
Similar events, to be held throughout the US and on the Net, are also being
planned.  Sponsors of the event include the Voters Telecommunications Watch
(VTW), EFF, Americans for Tax Reform, AT&T, Pacific Telesis, America
Online, Netscape, the Business Software Alliance, the Software Publishers
Association, and several others.

(2) SENATORS GO ONLINE TO DISCUSS PRIVACY AND SECURITY ONLINE

Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), the "Senior Senator from Cyberspace", ardent
proponent of Net.Freedom and co-sponsor of 2 bills to repeal encryption
export controls, will hold an online "town meeting" on Wednesday May 22 to
discuss privacy and security online.
