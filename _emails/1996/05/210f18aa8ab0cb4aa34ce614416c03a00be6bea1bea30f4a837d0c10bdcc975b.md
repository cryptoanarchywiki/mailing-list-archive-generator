And any successors that take their place, as well.  Remember, even a tiny 
fraction of the population can eject (by forced resignation or worse) an 
officeholder.  The only ones who survive (literally or figuratively) are the 
ones who don't irritate even a tiny fraction of the public.  Those will be 
the ones who don't do anything, and are not paid by stolen taxes.

To a great degree, the "public perception" of drugs and drug laws has been a 
_product_ of the news media, in particular the TV networks and the 
newspapers, as influenced by the government.  Study the matter and you'll 
find this is true.  There is no reason to believe that the community will be 
as anti-drug as the conventional wisdom says they are.

This "whipping" is quite intentional.  It keeps cops, prosecutors, and 
judges employed.  Not to mention politicians.

Please understand:  While the term "assassination" is usually used to refer 
to killings of high-level people, I'm using a broader definition to refer to 
ANY target, including middle and lower-level people.  My solution is far 
more thorough than you've implied.  Anyone who exercises force for the state 
is subject to "recall."  Even people who just take a government paycheck are 
at least nominally at risk.

How "removed" do they have to be to be innocent, in your opinion?

Nuclear bomb design.  Done with funds stolen from taxpayers.  Done to 
protect the leadership of this country, not the public.

In practice, it probably WAS "self-defense."  However, it may not have been 
a particularly selective example of self-defense.  The system I describe is, 
in fact, vastly more effective than this at getting rid of the bad guys, and 
far more selective than a planted bomb.

That's why I think my system will be far better.

Notice, however, that the US government fails to use a cleaner method to 
defeat its opponents (killing the leaders) and in  its place puts the lives 
of thousands of solders at risk.  Isn't this illogical, unless you realize 
that if WE can do that to those foreign leaders, THEY can do the same to OUR 
leaders?  Isn't this more than a bit self-serving on the part of our leaders?

And isn't it immoral for George Bush, for instance, to choose a solution 
that results in the deaths of tens of thousands of comparatively innocent 
Iraqis, both during and after the Gulf war, rather than bumping off Saddam 
Hussein?  Think about it.  Exactly why does he do the former, rather than 
the latter?

"Another set of costs"?  Yikes!  Read the essay, governments as we know them 
can't possibly survive post-AP.

It may be looked at as an example of vigilante action, but it will be 
ANONYMOUS vigilantes.

That's conventional wisdom.  Historically, anarchy is considered unstable.  
Freud though so, but he was wrong.  Read part 9.

Well, I disagree.  Until recently, public opinion was almost entirely
manufactured.  It was a joint project of the government and the news media.

Is there any significant likelihood that the people in power today will 
relinquish power absent a system such as AP?  I'm not optimistic about that.
