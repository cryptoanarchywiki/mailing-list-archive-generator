An organization that is efficent at enforcing a immensely complex set of
regulations incomprehensible to joe sixpack is not a good thing.

Recall also that the IRS enforces the rules and intrepretations that it

Our discussion is about the costs born by the citizen, I don't much care
how much the IRS is getting paid for its services.
