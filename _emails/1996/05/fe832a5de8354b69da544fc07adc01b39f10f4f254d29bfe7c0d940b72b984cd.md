a good idea.  what we really need to do is to obtain, by whatever means
seems available, a copy of "the briefing", and to publish it, 
on the web/net, with detail anotations of each point. having
their story in public view would certainly take away a lot of it's power.
also, on the off chance that there were any errors in their version of 
the facts, it could make for an interesting q&a session when the next
receiptent didn't buy the pitch.

ps.. no, i don't know, right off-hand, how to obtain such a copy, 
but if the employee manual that was making the rounds a few years was
what it porported to be, well, there's hope for this document to
see the light of day. (-:
