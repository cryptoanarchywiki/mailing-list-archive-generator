It does.  My apologies.

Any increse less than $50 in the bracket rates is rounded down to the next
multiple of $50 under Section 1(f)(6)(A).

I do also recall a threshold statement of some sort, but I always thought
it refered to the $50 rounding exception.

Agreed.  And many states do not adjust taxation brackets for inflation.

My 1994-1995 code indicates 39.6% for single heads of households with
incomes over $250,000.  (Pay $77,299, plus 39.6% of the excess over
$250,000).  That was for the 1994 tax year.

If there was an explicit raise, I haven't heard (though this isn't too
surprising, I haven't paid much attention to domestic U.S. tax rates
lately).

There is a phaseout of personal exemptions and deductions for the highest
bracket which can effectively bring the tax rate above 40%.  Is this what
you mean?  (Or have I been sleeping through the tax legislation process?)

Agreed.  As per other forces, I can't see any given the Forbes fall and
the lack of interest in a flat reform measure.

I do, however, predict that compliance will begin to fall much more
dramatically following any explicit raise above 40%.
