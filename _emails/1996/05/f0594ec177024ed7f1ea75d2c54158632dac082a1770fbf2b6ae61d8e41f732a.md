Except see footnote 1.

Looks like someone paying offshore for Mr. May to me.  Again, 30%
withholding requirement unless you intend to hide it.  The only way to
avoid this is to conceal Mr. May's involvement.

I really suggest you read some U.S. tax code provisions.

Such a jurisdiction will have extensive information sharing provisions
with the United States.  If you're planning on secrecy, avoid 
jurisdictions with tax treaties.

Also note that payments to an account for which Mr. May is the beneficiary
can trigger realization in several circumstances.

In this case the offshore entity can easily be classified as a Foreign
Personal Holding Company.  The resulting assets will be taxed per Subpart
F income.  (i.e. without regard to their distribution).  If the offshore
entity is held by U.S. stockholders it is going to cause major problems.
If not it still has major problems.
 
What you fail to mention is that in the event Mr. May actually holds the
assets until his retirement, he will still have to deal with realization
and full taxation when he taps into the funds.  You also fail to mention
the reporting requirements for U.S. citizens holding offshore assets of
significant size.

Because this plan can't seem to decide if it is secret or not, it has
serious shortcomings.

The example given looked to take advantage of large numbers of fictitious
employees all participating in the endeavor.  This is foolish.

Even in your example above, secrecy is poorly thought out.  Either it is a
tax avoidance plan, or it is a tax evasion plan.  Which is it?

Practically speaking I think you have merely altered the plan to adjust
for my comments and are stuck between both fact scenerios now.

See above.  See also foreign personal holding company and passive income
provisions.

Wherever Mr. May sends his money it is still subject to taxation in the
United States if Mr. May is a citizen.  Structuring the payments to an
offshore entity in an attempt to avoid taxation on those payments is an
attempt to get the IRS to honor form over substance.  Good luck.

Caveat emptor.  (What's the name of your firm by the way?  Or do you
prefer to keep it concealed?  I would think you'd advertize it here if
you had anything worth selling).

Your ilk, (other examples of which can be found in the back of The
Economist, and Soldier of Fortune), are a small step above "get rich
quick" types.  Off the shelf companies and trusts have their uses but
anyone proposing to sell a standard tax avoidance/evasion setup off the
shelf should trigger major alarm bells.

Cuban's will serve you better in a federal country club than cigs, this I
admit.

I think calling this any kind of version of serious tax planning is
inaccurate.
