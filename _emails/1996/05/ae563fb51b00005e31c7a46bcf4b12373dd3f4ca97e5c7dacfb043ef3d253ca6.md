In many cases, sure it is. I can't see how giving you the information to
establish that I can pay a bill I owe you should be in any sense treated as
a license do anything else with that info. A great many transactions are
finite, and ought not have lingering implications or side deals dangling off
the end.

In the long run, this is where anonymous payments come in. In the meantime,
I muddle on as best I can.
