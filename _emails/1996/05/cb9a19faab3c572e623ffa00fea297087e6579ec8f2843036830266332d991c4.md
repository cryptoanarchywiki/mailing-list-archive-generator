I don't think this comparison is valid at all.

What if I just *see* your couch, and then back in my garage I use my
couch replicator to make a couch just like yours, complete with fuzzballs
and loose change between the cushions?  Now I have your couch, in a sense.
Are you still upset?

When I walked off with your blood chemistry data, did you lose the use
of it for your future purposes?

And try this:  I now am in posession of some information about you, 
specifically:

* You subscribe to cypherpunks and are aware of (and possibly a sympathizer
towards) a variety of wacko political ideas;

* You believe in "strong" ownership rights over information (something 
handy if I'm on some legislative warpath and need supporters)

What do you propose as to the obligations I should have to you as regards
the disposition of this information?  For example, what if I receive a 
phone call from somebody interested in any e-mail addresses of people I
know who might be interested in supporting the new on-line copyright bill?
I just might decide to sell him your address.
