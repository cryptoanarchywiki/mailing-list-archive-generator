this seems to suggest a misunderstanding of PICS either by you or
the "CyberAngels". PICS does not require any particular action by page owners
and is entirely based on that principle (there is a pretty good
argument it would be unconstitutional, impractical, idiotic, etc. if
it didn't). it defines a standard by
which ratings servers and queries are constructed and formatted.
anyone can rate any information. if the CyberAngels want to rate
all kinds of pages in cyberspace and set up their own rating service,
more power to them. the ratings do not restrict those who do not
choose the restrictions.

I hope we can get a new conventional wisdom going, in which people
who rant about saving children from the evils of cyberspace are
told to shut up and go start their own rating service. they can
blacklist as many sites as they want. but the real test will be
whether anyone CARES what they think.
