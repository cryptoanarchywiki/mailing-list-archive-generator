   5-2-96 FiTi reports at length on its investigation of a $19
   million fraud and conspiracy involving smart cards using
   the Fiat-Shamir algorithm for encrypting UK video.

   Most of the detailed, complicated report is about the
   financial and tax-evasive shenanigan's of firms jointly
   providing the cards to BSkyB sat-tv.

   Adi Shamir's work is featured but he does not appear to be
   at fault, although a central role was played by News Data
   Security Products (10% owned by Shamir). 

   The report does not get into the technology of crypto, but
   shows its keylock appeal for criminal conspiracies.
