  Yes.  One of the things that you can configure is an addition to the
user agent string, so xyz corp can make it Mozilla/3.0XYZ.  You can then
configure your proxies and servers to only accept clients with that string. 
Note that this is not 100% hack proof.  Someone on your network who knew
what they were doing could circumvent this by hacking their own browser,
but it will keep normal users from subverting the system.
