ROTFL. From

Special mention must go to an ongoing debate about anonymous remailers, which
was an area where we were less informed.  Thanks to  an154280@anon.penet.fi
 for lots of very helpful suggestions.  For those of you interested in the
debate about anonymity we have two suggestions:  firstly we have a HUGE FAQ
on "Identity, Privacy and Anonymity on the InterNet", written by L.Detweiler,
and if any of you want it, please write to us and ask for it (WARNING it is
138k!)  Secondly you can write to help@anon.penet.fi for their FAQ on their
anonymous service, which is also very educational.
