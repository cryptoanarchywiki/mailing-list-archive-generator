	I don't agree with NAMBLA, BTW, in case anyone is wondering...

	Quite. There's also the misuse of it by other countries to do
filtration (Chinese firewall et al). While this isn't an argument that having
it is something that shouldn't be permitted, it's a consideration that those
constructing some such system should keep in mind. I haven't seen any evidence
that either RCIS (sp?) or SafeSurf have done so.
