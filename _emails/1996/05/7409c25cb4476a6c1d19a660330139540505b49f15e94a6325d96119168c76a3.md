However, you haven't explained why mere "observance" would translate into a 
call to the cops (if that's what happened; according to the reports it did) 
under those circumstances.  I can observe a lot that doesn't necessarily 
induce me to drag the cops into it.

Initially, I was thinking that perhaps the neighbors might have become 
suspicious, walked over and saw a capsized canoe.  However, according to 
another item the canoe was over 400 yards from the house, which is 
sufficiently far to make it difficult to see along many shorelines.  Do you 
have an alternative explanation?

It's odd.  You're the third person to use the term "conspiracy" when I 
haven't mentioned the word.  Somehow, I think that you guys must be misusing 
the term "conspiracy" when what you really mean is something else.  Why not 
pick up an OED, an choose a better word.
