The technique is called "parking", and it has been illegal for many 
years. Basically it requires at least 2 people to conduct the "resource 
shifting". Two accounts are established, one takes all losses against a 
commodity and the other gets the wins. This is rolled over almost 
exponetially by "pyramiding" contracts on margin. As such, the person or 
institution who requires the "loss" handles the losing account directly. 
The other account may or may not be handled by the first party, but they 
have access to it, or use an intermediary such as a broker to funnel the 
"wins" accordingly.
