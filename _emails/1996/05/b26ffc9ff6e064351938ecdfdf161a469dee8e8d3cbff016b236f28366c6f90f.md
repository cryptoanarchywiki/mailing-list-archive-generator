I just finished Richard Morin's Internet Notebook column in Unix Review.
This month's column was entitled "Censorship-Thwarting Tools".  It
discusses a prototype web proxy called Rover
(http://www.cfcl.com/tin/P/9606.nph-rover).  And gives some sites
(http://www.cfcl.com/tin/P/9606.rovers.html).  The best part of the article
is a discussion at the end that describes enhancements - to include
encrypted links.  It was great to see these issues discussed in a
"mainstream" computer publication.

BTW, Richard's columns are available on-line at http://www.cfcl.com/tin.
The article I referenced is 9606.  The on-line version is not as complete
as the one in Unix Review however.
