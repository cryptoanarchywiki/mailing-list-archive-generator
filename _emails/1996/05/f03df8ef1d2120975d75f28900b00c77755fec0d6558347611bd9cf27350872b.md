Sure.  Here is the beginning of the press release:

   Stream, LitleNet, BBN, and KPMG Announce Industry-Wide Initiative
   to Enable Wide Scale Software Electronic Commerce

   Westwood, MA - May 7, 1996 - Supported by AT&T,IBM , First Data,
   Microsoft Stream International Inc. and LitleNet in association
   with BBN and KPMG, announced today the formation of the Electronic

   initiative is to develop standards and build and operate a scalable
   clearinghouse infrastructure that will make electronic distribution
   of software secure, accountable, quick, and inexpensive.  The group
   expects the ELSI clearinghouse, which will be designed to accommodate
   various industry approaches, to be operational in test mode by late
   1996...
