Why is it that we even need a "national cryptography policy"?  We don't have 
a "national beer policy," do we?  A "national furniture policy"?  A 
"national pencil policy"?  A "national movie policy"?

The very concept of a "national cryptography policy" implies a level of 
centrally-controlled interest that is unjustified given our constitutution and laws.

Does this mean, "Give people what they want," or merely "suck up to 
industry"?  There is a difference...

What if "commercial requirements" including security the NSA can't break?

Where's the justification for any restrictions at all?  We all know that 
good encryption is going to get out, anyway.  No criminals are going to use 
escrowed encryption, which removes the justification for a restriction.

And what is a "legally authorized request"?  If a encryption user in another 
country is given a "legally authorized request" from a US court, in what way 
is it binding on HIM?

Why are these "critical international dimensions"?  Why "critical"?  I don't 
see it as coming even close to being "critical."

Gee, I wonder who they're thinking of!

What's wrong with just punishing the underlying crime?  What about some day, 
when encrypted telephones are ubiquitous, and we use them without thought?  
Does that mean we're all guilty of an extra crime or two, just by using that 
crypto phone?
