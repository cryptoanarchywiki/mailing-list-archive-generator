A book by Peter Wayner (pcw@access.digex.com), 
of interest to cypherpunks.
(OK, cypherpunks mailing list subscribers then)

There is more info at Peter's home page:
http://www.access.digex.net/~pcw/pcwpage.html 
but I couldn't get to it when I tried just now.

I got my copy from Border's in Houston on Sunday.

He describes mimic functions, a particular interest of 
mine.  He also covers basic encryption, error correction, 
secret sharing, compression, context free grammers, 
anonymous remailers, reversible computing, etc.

There is an evaluation of several stego packages, and 
an inclusive (there isn't enough published about 
steganography to call it extensive) bibliography.

The presentation is at an introductory, but not trivial 
level.  I wish there had been more technical explanations, 
but I suppose the author would have lost a sizable fraction 
of an already tiny audience.  

By the way, "the people who participate on the cypherpunks 
mailing list" get a nice "thankyou" in the preface.
