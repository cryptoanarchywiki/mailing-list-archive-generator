   5-29-96. FiTi: 
 
   Chips Galore [Editorial] 
 
 
   Texas Instruments' claim to have developed a technology 
   capable of inscribing 125m transistors, or computing 
   elements, on a thumbnail-sized slice of silicon is 
   remarkable chiefly because the technique is commonplace. 
   ... 
 
   The consequences for society of this continued rise in 
   complexity are perhaps not fully grasped even in an age in 
   which computers are taken for granted. The latest 
   technology promises ubiquitous, tiny packages of electronic 
   intelligence. Today's model is the smart card and the tiny 
   videocamera. Tomorrow, tiny processors will be embedded in 
   jewellery, spectacles, buildings and furniture. ... 
 
   Widely distributed computer power will confer substantial 
   advantages on society; but it will create new ethical 
   problems for society, such as the individual's right to 
   privacy, which may be at least as difficult to master as 
   the technology.
