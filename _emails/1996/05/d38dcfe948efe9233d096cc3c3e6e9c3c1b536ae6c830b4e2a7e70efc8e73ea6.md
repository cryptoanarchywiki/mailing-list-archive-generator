Ok, I see what your looking for now. How about tracking the number of
product registrations, either via a mail-in card or fax? I'm assuming
that since this is a product to be sold, not given away, that persons
purchasing the program would most likely take the time to fill out a
product registration card and send it in.  Since not everyone fills these
cards out, it is not a 100% accurate method, but if there were any major
discrepancies, then you would be aware of it.
