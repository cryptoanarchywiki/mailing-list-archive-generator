My guess would be that the first of these two points answers the second.  
Everything is exportable -- except signed third-party security packages.  
My bet would be that the exportable code would not be more than RC4-40 or 
perhaps 1DES, but that a signed package would go to RC4-128, 3DES, and 
RSA-1024.  However, the signature on that package would be on the 
condition that the vendor/distributor of that package follow all export 
regulations.

This is the way Micro$oft's CAPI is supposed to work; it's got 
commodities jurisdiction approval already, my bet is Sun can get the same.
