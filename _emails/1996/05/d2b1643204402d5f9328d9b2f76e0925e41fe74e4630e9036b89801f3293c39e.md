While I wont argue the veracity of floating point use in financials, I 
will make a point or two for your consideration.

The basic issue in the micro world has been imprecision - primarily due 
to word size (8 and 16 bit). Frankly I view it more as a pain tolerance 
to estimation. 

Now that 32 and 64 processors are handy (yes the 80 bit x87 has been 
around for a while), it becomes more of an issue of hair splitting. 

I never incorporate floating point into any of the financial software I 
have written over the years, primarily just on a matter of principle. 
Secondly, since most of it was written to the Intel platform (read 
washing machine controller), there is a very distinct advantage in doing 
integer only from purely a performance basis.

As to acuracy. Normally it doesn't matter when the rounding error sits 
some 18 to 23 decimal places out, when you are calculating dollars and 
cents, but many of the calculations I have been forced to endure center 
around such mathematical abuses as compound interest. Here, it is not 
only probably, but expected to work thousands of recalculations in a 
series, with each building upon the last. Rounding error grows very 
quickly in these types of circumstances. However, just to be fair, there 
is a plethora of business math done in software that limits itself from 
one to several recalcs, and the accuracy only needs to be to the penny or 
at worst 4 to 6 decimal places out.

Even Intel can handle this.... :-)

>From alt.humor.pentium:

DId you hear that Intel has found a home for all those pentiums with the 
floating point error ? They sold them to Mattel.

Now when you pull Barbie's string, she says "Math is hard..."
