I was wandering around in Amazon Books, http://www.amazon.com/, when I
stumbled across an interesting entry for Vernor Vinge: "True Names: And the
Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier".  It's due out in August.  It would
appear that True Names is finally being reissued?  Since I've never been
able to get my hands on a copy of True Names to read, I would be pleased by
this.  Anybody know any more?
