	The simplest cure for this, and one that would be effective - unlike
implorings by the PICS designers - would simply be to not have inclusion of a
rating in a page as part of the protocol. In other words, if you want a
rating, get it from an agency.

	As I have previously stated, I irritated Mr. Hatcher by trying to get
the CyberAngels to concentrate on spamming and other actual dangers to the Net,
as opposed to their censorship efforts. (I count acting as an informant for
governmental censorship a variety of censorship). Consequently, I have been
asked not to mail to them.

	Quite. Anything that both the CyberAngels and, say, the Christian
Coalition rate as unsuitable for minors is likely to be interesting.
