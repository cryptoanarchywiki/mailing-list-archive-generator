Gosh, so the TV and radio companies would get to broadcast tax-free and
the rest of us would have to pay. Not like this is intended to turn the
scary old Internet into the digital equivalent of the broadcast media.

Hmm, maybe "Cypherpunks Productions" should start broadcasting soap operas
and gameshows with email and Usenet stego-ed into the low bits.
