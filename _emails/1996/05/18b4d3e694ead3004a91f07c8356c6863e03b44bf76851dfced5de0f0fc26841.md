	Or turn in too powerful a crook. Law enforcement won't just go
away. There will always be those of us who feel that most crimes _don't_
deserve the Death Penalty, and that some sort of penal system will
continue to be necessary. In your system this would not be possible
because most people would be afraid to turn people in for fear of
reprisal. 

	I think that the biggest flaw in your system is the belief that
people will act rationally. Do you think that the Menendez(sp?) brothers
would have hesitated one second in having there parents offed to collect
the inheretance?

	Umm... I think that the biggest reason that the Police don't want
you taking the law into your own hands is that civilians tend to screw up
badly. They get the wrong target, they don't stop when they should etc. 
	The POLICE usually don't have a problem with an individual
protecting themselves (as long as the response fits the crime, killing a
shoplifter is a no no.) It is the court system that frowns on it.

	Is there the ability to predict a "mild beating" with your system?
or a "severe beating", or simply a killing? Having one level of punishment
is not a very good legal system. AP cannot replace it.

	See, you have far more faith in humanity than I do.
