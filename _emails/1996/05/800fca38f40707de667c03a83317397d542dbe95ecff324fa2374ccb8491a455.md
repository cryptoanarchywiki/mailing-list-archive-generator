I've just got a Pentium and Win95 so I can try to get NOISE.SYS working for
both. It seems to crash in Win'95 though... not sure why  yet: has anybody
used it or had problems with it on Win95/DOS7?

(I've gotten it loaded using a device driver loading util from the command
line, but the RANDOM$ device produces only one byte and a string of zeros...
not good at all. Very bad, actually. URANDOM$ seems to work fine though.)
