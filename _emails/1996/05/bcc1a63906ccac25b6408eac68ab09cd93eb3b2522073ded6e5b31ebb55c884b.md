Crypto++ 2.1 has just been released.  You can find download instructions
on the Crypto++ home page at http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai/cryptlib.html.

Crypto++ is a free C++ class library of cryptographic primitives.  Changes
made in version 2.1 include:

    - added Tiger, HMAC, GOST, RIPE-MD160, LUCELG, LUCDIF, XOR-MAC,
      OAEP, PSSR, SHARK
    - added precomputation to DH, ElGamal, DSA, and elliptic curve
      algorithms
    - optimizations in elliptic curves over GF(p)
    - changed Rabin to use OAEP and PSSR
    - changed many classes to allow copy constructors to work correctly
    - improved exception generation and handling

This is likely to be the last major revision of Crypto++.  Future
versions will probably only be released for bug fixes and compliance to
new standards.

P.S.  A new set of benchmarks done using Crypto++ 2.1 is available at
http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai/benchmarks.txt.
