In this scheme, all employees are pseudonymous so a disgruntled worker would
have nothing to report.

A company could not afford to have such a loss of reputation.  Nobody is going
to work for a company that doesn't pay its employees.

I think that this could be solved by having services which could exchange
ecash for real cash and real cash to ecash.  Also, such a system could be
used for fully anonymous ecash -- sort of like a remailer for virtual money.
