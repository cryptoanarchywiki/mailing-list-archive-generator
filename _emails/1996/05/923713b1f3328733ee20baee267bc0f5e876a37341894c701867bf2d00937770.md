	I do not disagree with that countries shouldn't place any more
restrictions on Scientology than they do on any other profit-making business.
It's simply that a remailer operator would be more likely to win in court in
such a country; if Scientology isn't _allowed_ in a country, this isn't good
but they at least can't exactly do any nuisance suits. To a lesser degree,
they might be suable back very easily if the judge & jury were sympathetic. I
got the basic idea from the regulatory arbitrage section in your Cyphernomicon,
as it happens.
