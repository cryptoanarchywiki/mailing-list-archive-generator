Telling your terminal to lie will be rather difficult once the CPU refuses
to run an OS with out propper signatures. The OS in turn won't run
applications without such signatures. All commercial software has to
undergo code review by CAs. Your machine won't even run anything but
approved software. Should you think about keeping an old machine around
that does, my advice would be: don't. At least not unless you are willing
to face the ten years prison term mandatory for such a computer crime.
