Such a list could be published openly in any case since discussing
techniques of tax fraud is legal.  Even advocay would be legal in almost all
cases.  (Since tax fraud is a non-violent crime, you don't have any of these
'agitating an angry mob' scenarios.)  As long as you avoided conspiring with
anyone, you can discuss techniques all you like.  Some *participants* might
like to subscribe anonymously however.
