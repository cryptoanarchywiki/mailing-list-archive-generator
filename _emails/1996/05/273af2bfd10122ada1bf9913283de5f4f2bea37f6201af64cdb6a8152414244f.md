   June Byte features "Electric Money," by Udo Flohr. 
 
   He reviews the key areas of security, authentication, 
   anonymity and divisibility; examines the products of 
   DigiCash, DEC, MS, RSA, IBM and others offering E-cash, 
   digital checks, digital bank checks, smart cards and 
   electronic coupons and tokens, with side glances at 
   Europes's CAFE and Oscar. 
 
   Peter Wayner guarantees "How to Make a Million Dollars" by 
   minting electric money.
