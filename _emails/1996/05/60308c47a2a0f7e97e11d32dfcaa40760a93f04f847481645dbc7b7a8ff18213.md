Two quick answers:

1)      What big business wants and what it would be
        willing to accept in order to make sales, are
        two different things.  While demographic data
        are nice, an more robust economy full of big
        spenders is better.

2)      Big businesses are made up of individuals.
        Most individuals would still prefer to have 
        their own privacy preserved even if they would 
        prefer less privacy for others.
