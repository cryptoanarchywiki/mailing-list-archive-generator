I wouldn't normally respond to such an offtopic post, but this post is
so egregious I couldn't let it pass. Who says they make a choice to live
in rural areas? Do they also choose not to have enough money to pay
for shoes? So, because they live in a poor district they are not entitled
to the same level of education as a rich city suburb?  The illiteracy
rate in Alabama is 40%! This is just plain sick!  I don't think that
every school needs a net connection, I think they need better teachers. But
the statement that we shouldn't subsidize rural customers because they
CHOOSE to live there (even though some are poor and can't afford to live
anywhere else) is just plain fallacious. Just because you choose to live
in the city does not mean people always choose to live where they live.
Education is one thing (perhaps the only thing) that deserves to be
subsidized in this country. We're rapidly falling behind.
 I don't agree with the $10. I'd need convincing that every school
needs a net connection when the students can't read, but the tone of the
above message is callous, besides being wrong.
