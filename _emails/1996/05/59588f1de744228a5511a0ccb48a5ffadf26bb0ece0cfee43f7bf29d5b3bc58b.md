	It is interesting to note from the CIEC trial bulletin (which they
won't let me quote part of, according to their initial notice - stupid policy)
and other sources that the conservatives won't let people just rate
"objectionable" material in order to keep it from them. They want it off the
net/world whether or not it's rated. Thus, the idea that vznuri and others
(such as the various proponents of its current use) have that PICS can save
the net from the conservatives et al doesn't work. Nice idea (maybe), but no
cigar.
