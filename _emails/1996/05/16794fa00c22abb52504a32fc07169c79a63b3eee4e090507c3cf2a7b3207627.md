Once I was more or less done laughing and got off the floor, it occurred
to me that this could provide a revenue stream for anonymous remailers. 
You'd charge advertisers sub-pennies for these little trailers. I
understand that Sameer is getting very little Ecash for his
remail/by-www.html, but maybe if he sold advertising space?

Sure it's crass, but it supposedly works for Juno, the "free email" 
service...
