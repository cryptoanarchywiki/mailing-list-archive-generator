Yes, they are.

Apparently, very much so.

Only as far as is mutually agreed.  If two people want to do business, we 
can reasonably expect that they will do so under whatever conditions they 
can agree to.  If one of those conditions is that they require ID from the 
other, fine.  The problem comes when third parties (like, for instance, 
government) requires it; that's wrong.

I don't think it's apocalyptic.  But that's because I think there's a 
permanent solution to their meddling.
