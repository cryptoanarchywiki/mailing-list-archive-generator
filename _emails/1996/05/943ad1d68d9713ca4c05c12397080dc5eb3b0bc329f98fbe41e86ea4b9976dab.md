The major battle the net has faced is with the church of scientology.

In this battle the net is clearly in the right, and the church clearly
in the wrong, regardless of what copyright law says.  Retreat on
this issue would be politicaly inadvisable, for it would radically
weaken us in the next battle, which will doubtless concern much more
vital matters than a band of con men.

What do I need to do to support a remailer that posts to non binary
newsgroups? (I do not have root control on a unix machine other than my
employers machine, for which I am unlikely to receive approval to use 
in this fashion.)
