You can hide your income by putting it in another jurisdiction.

As a cut from the money Tim's employer gives him.

No it doesn't. One person knows where they money went when it left the
country (and he is getting paid for the risk of doing time). Nobody knows
where the funds are concealed. Probably in a trust that you can access
