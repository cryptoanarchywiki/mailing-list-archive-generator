The claim was that Matt Blaze got "the briefing". I asked him about
this, and this is what he said to me (forwarded with permission).

   I don't think I actually got "the briefing".  They invited the
   seven authors of the key length report down to DC to talk with a
   bunch of policy types, but they never showed us the bodies (or the
   files on us, or whatever it is they show the people who they really
   want to impress).
