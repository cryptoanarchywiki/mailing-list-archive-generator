I think building trust in this kind of thing is a big problem.  There are
so many ways you can get ripped off.  Failure to distribute.  Fake costs in
the accounting.  Off record sales of the product.  Phantom partners who do
nothing but funnel profits to someone. etc. etc. etc.  A fully anonymous
audit may be what is needed, unless you are able to build enough trust in
an individual nym that you won't get ripped off.  Anyone got a protocol for
fully anonymous auditing?
