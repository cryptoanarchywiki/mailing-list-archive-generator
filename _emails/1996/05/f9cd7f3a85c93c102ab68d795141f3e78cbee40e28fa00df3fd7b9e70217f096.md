But, my dear, even in the most libertarian or AP-ruled world, they 
would absolutely free to give away *all* of their salary for the 
causes they consider valid.  Only, thoses who don't agree with them 
would not be coerced into thoses noble causes.

This paragraph seems to indicate that the only difference between
libertarians and socialist is a mere difference of opinion and that
everybody is justified to act on their beliefs.  But the socialists
who pretend that are simply blanking out the fact that *they too*
recognize that Reality Is since they want to use force to get a
lunch out of the mouth of somebody who have one (and who happened to
produce it himself) to put it in the mouth of another who didn't
have.  Therefore, it is OK to deny reality when somebody come up
with arguements against socialism, but it is darn convenient to use
it (in the form of a loaded gun...)

BTW, they do not "ostensibly" form the state.  They simply 
*do*not*coerce* individuals into being sacrificial animals for the 
unearned benefits of others...

Oh, you mean, "for them, anybody who pass a judgment of his own that 
contradict them should be killed"  I see...

I'd prefer a pink elephant with wings.  Do you think that govt does 
not target peoples?

JB seem to agree with the view that turning our most productive
individuals into sacrificial animals for the benefit of the less
productive is not exactly a kind thing to do.  I tend to agree.
To say "commensurate" means that you must quantify various things in 
their proper context.  I invite you to do so.

It does not legitimates murder per se.  I don't think that JB ever 
said that murder was legitimate.  He only explained that the 
technology makes it inevitable to happens and that he believes that 
the outcome will be a better society.  You will note that to the 
act of murdering, he opposed many other actions, including many that 
leads to direct loss of lives.  He claims that the positives will 
outnumber the negatives.  As to the morality, by your own standards, 
of starting a "Vietnam" war, I suppose it is highly questionnable, or 
so you seems to indicate.

Jim Bell does not believe that AP will evolve in a moral vacuum.  On
the contrary (and most collectivists think he is wrong), I think he
believes that human beings have an intrinsic sense of justice and
that this will prevail.

Well, of course, our perception of reality is context dependent.  But 
you seems to attempt to hint that truth is relative because knowledge 
is contextual.  It looks like an attempt on reason.

I think that by the nature of AP, this would be ruled out.  Maybe 
there would be a fanatic president, but he would preside nothing 
because nobody would be there to enforce his fanatic views.

That is absolute BS.  It might have been true before, but with the
advent of the net and of computers and smart cards, it is becoming a
fallacy.  If Visa or Mastercard can operate on a voluntary basis,
the govt could also do it.  The technology makes it possible
that any individual who wish to subscribe to any of the various
insurances the govt could offer might do so.  Including contributions to
finance museums, research projects, etc.  And mandatory taxes could
be enforced in period of emergencies like wars, if ever they
happens.  

The population seems to have a very short memory: Before the great
wars, there was *no* income tax.  It is mainly with the advent of
socialism, coinciding with the nuclear era, that the taxes were hiked
to the level they are now.  Johnson blew up whatever Eisehower tried
to do.  Of course, it started before them but Eisehower tried to get
back to the old system.  I guess what defeated him what that too many
poeples longed for a free lunch...

Anyhow, we have the technology to institutes a card that would give 
access to most services like health care, unemployement insurance, 
etc.  Why don't they put it in place?
