Watch and act. This doesn't bother me.

What specifically bothers me is the reselling of information that I chose to
reveal for a specific transaction, most especially when I did so with an
assumption of privacy. I'm happy to provide businesses with the info they
need to see that I'm not going to stiff them on a sale. I am _very_ unhappy
that some of them then turn around and sell that info to others, and doubly
so when what gets passed on is wrong.

Things like that don't bother me, either. If I really didn't want to be
associated with Cypherpunks that way, I could do things to protect my identity.

On the other hand, say I sign up for a mailing list that charges a
subscription fee, like Extropians. I would feel no ground for complaint if
someone markets a list of Extropian subscribers - but I'd feel much ground
for complaint if I learned the list owner were selling credit histories
gathered during the subscription process. (Unless, of course, I assent to a
clause to the effect that the list owner can do anything he wants with my
credit info, as opposed to the specific purpose of getting payment for the
list.)
