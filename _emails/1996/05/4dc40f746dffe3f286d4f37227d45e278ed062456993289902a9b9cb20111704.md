The Agreement, as written, covers all of Mixmaster; it would be easier
for people to adapt Mixmaster code if you either release a bones version
or a license that clarifies that you can't use the RSAREF portions
commercially but can do whatever you want with the rest of Mixmaster
(if that's what you want) or however much freedom you want to grant
(e.g. you may want to say some disclaimerish words about obeying ITAR etc.)

Consensus.com is doing commercial licensing for RSAREF now; there may
be some reasonably-priced approach to the problem.

RSAREF has at least three kinds of legal protection:
- contract (if you're using a licensed version)
- patent (on doing RSA-method encryption, not on the code itself)
- copyright (on the RSAREF code itself.)
