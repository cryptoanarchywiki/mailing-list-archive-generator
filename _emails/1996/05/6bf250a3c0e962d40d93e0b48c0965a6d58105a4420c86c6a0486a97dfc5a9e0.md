	Umm... the RSA licensing agreement isn't exactly a negotiated contract.
What makes the difference between the contract in question and the RSA
licensing agreement (to use it as an example)?

	Part of this depends on negligent in what sense. If, due to the
message being encrypted, the remailer operator couldn't read it to see if it
was copyright-violating anyway, would he/she be negligent to send it on?

	The primary use of the contract is to avoid complaints from the user
for "harrassing" email, not to avoid copyright problems. I'm not sure if there
is anything that could be done to avoid the copyright problems, aside from the
disposable output addresses with multiple remailers using them. (One
possible problem with these is that it could be argued that the remailer
operators sending to such addresses can read over the mail before encrypting it
to the front end and check to see if it's a copyright violation. However, they
would appear to be covered by the exemptions that should be in the copyright
law, namely for ISPs - if they aren't covered, then the Net is dead anyway.)
One method around this would be for the initial user to specify the output
address - or, preferably, input address that outputted to multiple different
output addresses - to use, and encrypt the message for that addresss. However,
this would require common knowledge of the input addresses, which could lead
to their being shut down quickly or the owner being held liable. One could have
a group of input/output providers with a common public/private key for the
initial user to use for the final encryption, although then you'd need to be
careful about who you let into this group.
