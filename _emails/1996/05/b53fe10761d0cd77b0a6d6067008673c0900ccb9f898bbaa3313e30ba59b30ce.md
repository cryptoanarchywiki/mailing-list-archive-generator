	I have examined it; I see no reason to change my stated opposition
to it. Quite simply, it is an invasion of the privacy rights of businesses to
force them to turn over such information as the law demands they turn over; it
is an invasion of the property rights of businesses to mandate what they do
with the information they have received and consequently own.
