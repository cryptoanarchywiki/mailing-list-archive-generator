	As I have stated, I am currently working on the second edition of this
list. One consideration that I have thought of on using a banking-secrecy
country is that it may be possible to set up a local limited-liability
corporation there (assuming a remailer requiring an ecash payment), possibly
paying into a trust fund with duress provisions. As an example, I might set
up an offshore company in Anguilla which was owned by a trust fund; I would
be the initial trustee for this trust fund, and Vince Cate might be the
backup trustee if I was put under any duress (e.g., legal problems). Since I
would have some costs for the initial setup of such an operation, I would deem
it perfectly reasonable for the trust fund to owe me some money, which it would
then pay me back as interest on this loan.
