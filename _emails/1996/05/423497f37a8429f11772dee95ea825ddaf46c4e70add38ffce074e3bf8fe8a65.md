                   Electronic Privacy Information Center

                             September 16, 1996

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rapid evolution of technology is leading to the creation of a seamless
web of surveillance across much of the world. Powerful technologies
originally developed for the military are being adopted by law enforcement
and civilian agencies, and private companies to monitor entire populations.
This has been further fueled by the end of the Cold War and increasing
demands for greater bureaucratic efficiency. Existing laws and regulations
have failed to keep up with these developments.

This one day conference will examine a range of advanced surveillance
technologies and their impact on privacy and other civil liberties. It will
explore the process of planning and implementation of the technologies,
their operating conditions, and the people and organizations responsible for
them. The conference will also examine possible technical, regulatory and
legal responses.

The conference will also address in detail the findings of Privacy
International's "Big Brother Incorporated" report which examined the
international trade in surveillance technology and the involvement of the
arms industry.
