You will pardon my asking this, but, security from what? Who are the
evil Network Terrorists throwing Bit Bombs or whatever? The only
security you need on the internet is keeping your site from being
broken in to, which is mostly a matter of setting it up
properly. What, exactly, is the "Security" that you are offering us?
