	I believe this is another case, like that of the SafeSurf dislike of
the mention of illegal drugs in any but the standard PDFA (sp?) manner, in
which the Guardian Angels' politics are coming through. They may claim to be
anti-CDA, but given their harrassment of various sexually-oriented businesses
("cleaning up Times Square" et al) their real opinions seem to be showing
through. They'd make themselves even more unpopular if they were honest about
it, of course. I have no doubt that, if the CDA is upheld (God forbid), they'll
be secretly reporting violations to the DOJ. They already appear to have a
policy of reporting allegedly "obscene" material.

P.S. Feel free, anyone, to forward this (and my other stuff on the CyberAngels)
to them. I'd like to see their defense, unless they're going to admit they
don't have any.
