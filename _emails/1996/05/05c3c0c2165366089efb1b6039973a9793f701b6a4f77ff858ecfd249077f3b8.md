	Well, there are some mail-to-news gateways; I believe someone posted
on them a while back. You could write to the operators and ask them for a copy
of the software. I would suggest only accepting messages from mixmaster
remailers; this would reduce the likelihood of successful lawsuits against you
for the logs, since they won't give any information.
