The "Stanford" in the title is obviously just a typo.  Be aware that
they've been known to aggressively finger, etc. sites that contact their
site. 

I especially like this question, which I swear I am not making up: 

30. Search by Affiliation - for example "Working Women", "Lawyers", "Gay
    and Lesbian", "Hispanics", etc. [Must add] [Nice to add] [Don't care]

WhoWhere originally built their database by writing a script to
aggressively extract email addresses from the web server of OKRA, a
research computer at UC Riverside that had been culling addresses from
Usenet and other sources, making them freely available to the Internet
community. Two wrongs don't make a right, of course. OKRA has since taken
steps to ensure that noone else can extract mass quantities of addresses
in the same way.
