---------- Forwarded message ----------

Last night, C-SPAN carried a public session from the WEF meeting held last 
February in Davos, Switzerland.  It looked like a chorus of kinder 
gentler totalitarians, fascists, and Big Brothers.  Louis Freeh, speaking 
in bureaucratese, said it was time to create an international police 
force, stamp out uncrackable encryption, and enlist business as allies in 
implementing the total surveillance state.  Elie Wiesel, guru of Humanism 
from Boston U., was more direct and explicitly called for an 
international police force to protect us from nuclear terrorists and 
other bogeymen.

One bright note:  Freeh said a recent poll of interest to his bureau 
discovered that 10% of Americans believe the U.S. government was 
complicit in the Oklahoma City bombing.  Maybe there is hope after all.
