ug. I see that "market driven" didn't make a lot of sense the way I used
it. I was not talking about money. I was using it in the sense 
of "third-party ratings" vs. "self-ratings".  maybe the latter 
terminology is better.

I'd like to point out that market-driven systems, in the sense you use
of the economy supporting the creation of the ratings, already exist
in cyberspace.

examples:

1. point communications top 5%. people effectively pay this company
to find the "cool web sites" by buying their book or whatever.

2. surfwatch. as I understand it they have already rated many
sites out there on the internet and are using a proprietary system
that mimics a rating server. people are essentially paying for
them to rate web sites through the purchase price of the software.

other examples probably exist.
