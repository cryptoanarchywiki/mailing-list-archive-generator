I can find no evidence in Draft 2/23/96 of SET for 40bit DES keys.  (BTW, I
would not call CDMF DES, but this may be merely quibbling.)  On page 31, it
says, "The DES key format follows FIPS 46: it contains 56 bits of keying
material and eight optional check bits."

Since SET is very careful to not deal with anything but the financial
aspects of online commerce, they can probably get a license for export
under the current rules.  (SET only includes a SHA hash of the "contract",
calculated by both the cardholder and the merchant in its encrypted
content.  Both versions must match for the transaction to be authorized.)
