	Certainly, if you were coerced into giving up this information, it
would be wrongful - including to knowingly retransmit it. But that's only the
case for dealing with governments (and, I would include, other coercive groups
such as monopolistic and oglipolistic corporations). You do have a choice in
dealing with other entities. I make that choice; I minimize my use of a credit
card, for instance. I've had months where my bill was $0.00. Now, if the
agency in question is required to collect such information because of coercion,
then that's wrongful, and that information shouldn't be retransmitted.
