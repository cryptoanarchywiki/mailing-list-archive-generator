Yes, I should clarify that the article indicated that the whole system will 
be available in the "second quarter of 1996."  They say the fiber itself, 
"TrueWave" is available now.

True.  In fact, it may be that we simply don't need that rate of 
transmission yet.  Maybe somebody familiar with routers can tell us what 
kind of CPU horsepower would be required to do that effectively.  Economics 
dictates that such an extraordinarily fast and multiplexed system would only 
be used when it is cheaper than the alternative, using multiple lower-speed 
fibers.  If anything, I think the main impediment to the use of the higher 
rates is fact that fiber signals must be broken down whereever the fiber is 
terminated, and the cost of that termination would be astronomical if it had 
to handle 1 Tb/s.  Chances are good that one of the few places that such a 
system would be economical would be long-haul undersea cables where 
breakouts are rare and terminations are few.

I was figuring they'd cut out silences...as well as echo-suppression 
cutouts.   Do they still do this?  Given modern fiber's capacity, I wonder 
if they bother.

There's also a lot of 'dark fiber' out there, right?  Fiber laid as 
part of a cable but not activated, because it's not yet needed.  I got a 
look at a segment of the operation that laid a cable from Seattle (Vancouver 
BC?) to around San Francisco, about 5 years ago.  Got a chance to talk to an 
engineer, and ask a bunch of technical questions.  They laid three smaller 
(2" or so) plastic tubes in a larger outer tube, and the engineer said 
they'd later blow a cable through a single tube with compressed air.  He 
said they had no current plans to fill the other two tubes, because of lack 
of need.  And at the rate the fiber companies are improving transmission 
rates, it is unclear whether they will ever run out of capacity in such 
situations.

My numbers are not totally a WAG (wild-ass guess) but they are probably out 
of date even if they had any resemblence to the truth a few years ago.  I'd 
appreciate hearing more accurate figures if you know them.  Don't divulge 
company secrets or anything; I'm only interested in ballpark figures for the 
industry as a whole.

This suggests that there would be a market for a LD phone company that 
charged, say, a yearly payment of $200-300 for essentially unlimited use.  (The main 
impediment to this would be regulatory; as I understand it LD companies have 
to pay local telco's for connections on a per-minute connect basis.  Is that 
right?  This needs to get fixed.)   Their billing costs would be very small.

I think the market will have to migrate towards such services.  A backup 
fiber is an asset whose capacity can be easily "mined" for a substantial 
payback.  True, its availability is not particularly reliable, but that's 
exactly what the Internet was intended to be able to use, right?  I suspect 
that the real reason Internet hasn't migrated to such transmission systems 
is simply that its needs still don't demand anywhere close to the 
current-available fiber technology.  However, if traffic is tripling per 
year we'll need to see a substantial migration to full-fiber links within 
3-5 years.
