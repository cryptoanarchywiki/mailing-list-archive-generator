It means essentially the IRS and banks.  Even banks have little recourse.
They make you sign a piece of paper that says you gave them the right SSN,
but practically speaking no one cares.

Equifax (a credit reporting agency) refuses to take bank records as
evidence of SSN's because they KNOW the banks don't care or enforce and
that people lie to or make mistakes to the bank on a daily basis.
