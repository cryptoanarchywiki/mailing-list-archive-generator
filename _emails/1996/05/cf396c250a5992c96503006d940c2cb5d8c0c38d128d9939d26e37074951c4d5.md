No, think of scienter again.

And creating something or some service that _may_ be used in connection
with a crime does not make the creator a conspirator, unless it can be
shown that he was involved in the planning of the crime used with his thing
or service.

For example, if I open up a car rental place and one of my cars is used in
a bank robbery, was I involved in a "pre-meditation to conspire to the
commission of a felony."? Clearly not.

(And before anyone brings up "required ID" at car rental agencies, such ID
is not required by any local, state, or national laws, so far as I have
ever heard. It is perfectly legal for me to rent things to people without
demanding credentials. A sufficiently large deposit may be enough. ID is
often used to satisfy insurance requirements, and to help in collecting any
unreturned items.)

Now it may be that operating a remailer may be interpreted by some courts
as being a "public nuisance," a theory I credit to Brad Templeton, but this
has not yet come even close to happening.
