Thanks to recent legal inquiries by the Church of Scientology, they have
determined that Major Domo, believed to be an army officer stationed at
Fort George Meade, Maryland, is the control officer for the Cypherpunks
mailing list.

The Scientologists have determined that Major Domo works in "Terminal
Operations Access Division," or "T.O.A.D." By sending a message to
majordomo@toad.com, with the body messsage of  "unsubscribe cypherpunks"
(without the quote marks), Major Domo may choose to take pity on you and
remove you. Of course, his superior, Colonel Mode, may insist you remain on
the list.

"the only reason to run for Congress these days is to suck the lobbyists'
dicks and fuck the people who sent you there," ....any more than I care
