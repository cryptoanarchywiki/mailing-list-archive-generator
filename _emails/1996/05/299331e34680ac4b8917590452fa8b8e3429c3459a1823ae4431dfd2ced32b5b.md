According to WSJ, Leslie B. Samuels, "Treasury's top tax-policy official" says that "IRS-bashing is 'counterproductive and harmful'" -- and that "destructive rhetoric ... hurts the tax system and society" [elisions are the WSJ's]

What if a the CDA grew little by little by little until it covered statements deemed "destructive rhetoric" .... hmmm. I mean after all, if it harms society....!

Let's see ... Treasury: BATF. Key Escrow.
GAK, anyone?

;)   keep up the good work.
