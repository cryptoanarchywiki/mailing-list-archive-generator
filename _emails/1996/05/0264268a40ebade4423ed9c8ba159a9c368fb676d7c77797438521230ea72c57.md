ROTFL!!!!! Many thanks to jamesd@echeque.com for forwarding me Skippy's
original message.

I've never even heard of Mike Beebe, but I'll look him up on DejaNews. 
Boewulf is the nym of a very real racist who is so over-the-top silly (and
1/4 Jewish) that some people don't believe he's for real. I once claimed
to be "Beowulf" for laughs. "Nietzsche@gnn.com" was a real racist who
spammed widely in early January with a message smearing MLK; he later
posted a lot to news.groups about the rec.music.white-power troll, but
seems to have closed his account once the free hours ran out.
ezundel@alpha.c2.org is a friend of mine who reposts Ingrid's stuff to
alt.fan.ernst-zundel. ernztzundl@aol.com was a really annoying AOL troll
who has thankfully gone away. I've got enough email between him and me to
prove that we're different people, and of course he knew a lot about DC
that I couldn't. 

Wow.

At first I didn't believe that Skippy "or"  Dave Harmon were anything but
anti-racist spoofs, and I'm still not entirely convinced, but they're so
consistently malicious that they must have something against me.  I swear
that "Skippy" isn't me, but on second thought, I wouldn't really mind if
other people thought I was harassing myself. That would be poetic justice
indeed. Maybe if we don't believe he exists, he'll go away. 

So, Skippy, did you forge an unsubscribe message for tallpaul, or was
that someone else? I'll take my answer OFF THE LIST, PLEASE.
