Yup. Same difference. I typed the wrong word when producing my
post. The context was using "safe java" for markets in CPU cycles. In
that context, yes indeed, "safe" Java programs, applets, or whatever
you want to call them that you get over the network and can "trust"
aren't supposed to be able to do file i/o. The whole point was that
Java doesn't provide the execution environments you need for CPU cycle
markets. Sometimes my statements are incorrect, but its very rare
indeed that I don't know what I was trying to say.

As I said (and you called me a smartass for saying -- how polite of
you, by the way) I could only reply to what you posted, not to what
you could have posted. There was no indication in your accidental
partial post that it was an accidental partial posting. I'm not a
psychic.
