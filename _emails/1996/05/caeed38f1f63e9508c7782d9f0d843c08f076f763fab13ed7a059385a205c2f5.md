Its also a college town.  And a publishing center.  Then there's 
the warehouse district, and the post office.  There's also a thriving 
import-export business.  No wonder the political big-shots back in 
Atomland wish they could annex Cyberspace.  I predict that these 
attempts will succeed about as well as the European colonization of 
the Americas.  (ambiguity intended)

That's how boom-towns start, allright.

Yes.

We have streets all over the place.  From here theres a 56Kb 
lane road that's even fairly well paved.  But they mostly 
lead to "Atomland expatriot hobbyists" and a few service 
subsistance farms.

It will be a while, but someday folks will say:
"Save your greenbacks, Atomland will rise again!"
and they will be wrong.

>Still, it's a service industry.

Coming soon.... Virtual Food!  Okay, maybe I got 
a little carried away....
