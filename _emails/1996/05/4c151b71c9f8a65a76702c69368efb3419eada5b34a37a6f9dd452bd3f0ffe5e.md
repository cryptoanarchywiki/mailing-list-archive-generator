Cypherpunks is a _highly_ political newsgroup, it's just focussed
on enabling technology and not too worried about political agreement.
In this case, there are folks in Burma using PGP, and the cypherpunks
goals of creating the ability to have private communications make it
relevant to discuss societies where you can be busted for simply
possessing communications technology even if the Thugs can't
tell what you're saying on it.  And a 9-line PBX may be usable as
a telephone remailer...
