Just had to say this, on two statements from Doug Hughes:

>1.	You don't understand at all. It's not about being people down, 
	it's about bringing them 'UP'.

>2.	...making sure everybody has a good education is of paramount 
	importance to any society.
......................................................................


These sentiments are noble and on the face of them sound agreeably
empathetic with Mankind.

But what would be required to bring people "up"  (in spite of
themselves) and compose them into someone's idea of a good citizen in a
great society, would be to own them and thus to have the right to turn
them and shape them into what they "ought to be", so that they may
function on the same level as "everybody else".

Alternatively they could be set free (from tyrants & such - and we all
know who they are) to attend to the project of constructing a life, to
seek after creative solutions to the problems of existence on their own
chosen level of effort & ambition.

Which is what this American society was supposed to be about, I've read.
 
(Other countries have their own well-known methods of solving this
"problem".)

I hope I'm not the only one here who thinks so.
