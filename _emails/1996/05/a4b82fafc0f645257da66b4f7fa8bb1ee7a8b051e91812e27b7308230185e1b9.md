C'punks:

I got a call from a group in Maryland called "Marketing Technologies,
Inc."  They are starting to distribute free demo copies of a new crypto
technology created by "Blackstar, Inc."  The crypto product, called
"Supercrypt," is based upon "distorted number generation."  This does not
appear to be the product sold under the same name by Computer Elektronik
Infosys.  Naturally, I enquired as to where the algorithms had been
published in the technical literature, but the sales rep indicated that,
while copyrighted, Blackstar does not yet hold a patent so they are
concerned about releasing the details.  She described the product as using
a "proprietary" algorithm. 

If you'd like to get a demo copy of the software, call Marketing 
Technologies at 301.588.1971.  You'll probably be speaking with Linda 
Greenwald, who's got _some_ information available, but not anything that's 
technical.  They are also offering a technical write-up via fax-back at 
301.588.2162.

Note that I'm not endorsing this product, I'm just relaying information 
that may be of interest.  If anything, you can get a copy of a new toy to 
muck with in your spare(?) time.  No, they are not yet on the Internet.

I'll relay my experiences with the product after I get it.
