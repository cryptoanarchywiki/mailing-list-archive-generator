>FLAT PC SCREENS HEAD FOR THE DESKTOP
>Liquid crystal display screens currently cost about five times that of a

>the next couple of years, say LCD makers.  Next year, major LCD vendors
>expect to halve the difference, bringing prices down to two-and-a-half times

	IIRC, LCD screens are considerably harder to read off of by Tempest
equipment than normal CRT screens. An encouraging change.

>NORTHERN TELECOM PHONES GET JAVATIZED
>Northern Telecom plans to incorporate Sun Microsystems' Java microprocessors

>and customer trials should start next year.  (Wall Street Journal 23 May 96

	I would guess that these phones would still not be crypto-capable, but
I'm not quite sure what they have in mind to use Java in them for.
