	Well, the advantages are: A. I get Lance's help more quickly in setting
up this one, so I can later go to other machines (preferably out of the
country) and set things up the same way there (getting Mixmaster from an
out-of-US source, of course); and B. supporting the efforts of Sameer, Lance,
et al by paying them some money. While multiple ISPs are certainly
preferable (to avoid one rubber-hose (e.g., law enforcement) breaking from
getting everything), your argument assumes that all the machines at a given
ISP are linked together such that if one is broken, the rest are - which
isn't very good from a security standpoint, so I'd hope it _isn't_ the case.
