	This is the second edition of my listing of possible good companies
outside the US from which to run an anonymous remailer, assuming telnetting
to a UNIX shell in most cases. (Those marked with a + have access through PPP,
SLIP, or similar protocols). I have removed Malaysia from the listing due to
its government's suppression of free speech/press, which Rich Graves was kind
enough to point out to me.
	The countries on here are a mixture of those with strong support for
free speech/press, and those with useful laws regarding offshore companies,
through which a for-profit remailer might be run with limited liability.

* = This organization has on its main page a link to a document called the
"Declaration of an Independent Internet." It thus may be possible to persuade
them to support a remailer at reduced or no charge as part of this.

** = This organization's main page has the EFF blue ribbon, unlike others.

*** = This organization is run by a cypherpunk, Vince Cate. It does have the
disadvantages of requiring $50 a month or $420 a year for a telnet-only UNIX
shell, with a limit of 50 MB/month for mail without extra charges. However, its
charge is $20 a month or $168 a year for a POP account, although the limit is
then 20 MB/month for mail without extra charges.

        I would appreciate comment on all aspects of this list. These include:
additional companies and countries to add; companies or countries to take off
(international politics & law is not my subject); and suggestions about where
to look for more (it is quite possible that I did not locate all the lists of
out-of-US ISPs).
