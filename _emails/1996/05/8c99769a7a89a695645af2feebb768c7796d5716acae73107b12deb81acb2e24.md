	There is the increase in reputation capital in _some_ quarters possible
through running a remailer. (On the other hand, in authoritarian quarters, it
would tend to decrease one's reputation capital...)

	It prohibits commercial use? That's silly. Is it a
holdover from when the idea was to turn Mixmaster into a company?

	How would you be doing this? Only remailing from accounts that have
paid up, or what?
