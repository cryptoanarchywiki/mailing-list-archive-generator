As might be expected, the math on this just doesn't seem to work out.  If we 
assume that the average school has 500 students, and 1/2 of the 
telephone-using households have at least one kid in school (on average) then 
1000 telephone households at $120 extra per year, or $120,000 per school, is 
available to wire it.  That's a HELL of a lot of wire!!!  And that's just 
for a single year.   Why not just teach a few high school students wiring, 
pay them 2x the minimum wage, and give them a good summer job doing the wiring?


As for subsidizing rural customers...  Why not just install a cellular 
telephone site in an area that's too dispersed for efficient wireline 
telephones?  And most of these people are probably already in an area served by cellular.
