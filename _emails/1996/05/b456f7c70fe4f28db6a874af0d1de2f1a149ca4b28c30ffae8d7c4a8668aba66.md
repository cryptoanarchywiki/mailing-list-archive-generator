'Excommunication'

An anglo-Burmese businessman friendly with pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu
Kyi has been sentenced to thre years in jail for owning unauthorized
telephones and fax machines. James Leander Nichols, also known as Leo
Nicholas, was punished for having two fax machines and a telephone
switchboard with nine lines in his home, a spokesman for Suu Kyi's political
party said. In an effort to discourage contact between Burmese citizens and
the outside world, Burma's military government requires people to get
permission to own a fax machine, satellite dish, or sophisticated phone system.
