We are talking days now. Really, I mean it this time. I know I said that
last time (and the time before) but this time it is true. Trust me, I have
your best interests at heart :)

In fact, I have a working version. I am just beating on it a bit, and
waiting for the Mix enabled Private Idaho (in beta) to be ready. Since Mix
can't call sendmail on a PC, a front end is really required for it to be
useful.
