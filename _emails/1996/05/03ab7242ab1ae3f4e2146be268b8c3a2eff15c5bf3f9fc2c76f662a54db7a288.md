When a client wishes to make anonymous restitution.  Baird v. Koerner, 279
F.2d 623 (9th Cir. 1960) (Wherein attorney was retained to organize
anonymous payment of delinquent taxes and IRS demmanded identification of
clients by attorney).

The so called "missing link" exception, where where disclosure of the
identity of client, in conjunction with already available information,
would have the effective result of disclosing a privileged communication
or violating the privilege against self incrimination.  In re Grand Jury
Proceedings, 517 F.2d 666 (5th Cir. 1975); C.f., U.S. v Pape, 144 F.2d 778
(2nd Cir. 1944) (Holding that client's identity was not so protected,
but which may or may not still be good law); See Generally, Cleary et al,
McCormick on Evidence (3rd edition 1984).

Generally speaking, if the attorney believes or should reasonably know
that the item was stolen, privilege will not apply.

First question, I can think of few attornies who would actually advise a
client to destroy something that might even one day possibly be evidence.
Well, let me rephrase that.  I can think of few attornies who would
actually advise a client to destroy something that might even one day
possibly be evidence if they thought they might be caught.

Second question, If the court thinks it was a crime and evidence was
destroyed it doesn't much matter what the attorney thought at the time.
I'll have to check, but this is probably a "reasonably forseeable"
question.

Client Privilege, 66 Calif. L. Rev. 1061 (1978); Developments in the Law:
