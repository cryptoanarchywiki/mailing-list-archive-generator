I thing you misunderstood his answer, it installs Mixmaster and also
installs either the Ghio or Freedom remailer. There are several flavors of
remailer. The most common (but not most popular) are Cypherpunk and
Mixmaster. At this time there is only one implementation of Mixmaster,
mine. There are several version of the Cypherpunk remailer (A.K.A. Type 1)
of which "Ghio" and "Freedom" are two. Mixmaster is known as a Type 2
remailer. Type 1 and type 2 are completely incompatible.
