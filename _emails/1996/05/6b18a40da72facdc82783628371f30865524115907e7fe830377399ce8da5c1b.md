I hate hardware solutions.  I'm a software guy.  <img alt=":-)"

Okay having said I couldn't think of a good way, I'll go
ahead and suggest a way.


Let's assume that it is possible to stop people from
pretending to be anyone in Real Life(tm).  (It is possible.)
Now let's collect N people and form a Dining-Cryptographers'
net.  Once the Dining-Cryptographers' net is up-and-running
let's put out a call for each of the N participants to
announce a public key which will be their nym from now on.
Assuming that you get N public keys, you can have _some_
degree of assurance that there is a one-to-one mapping
between pubkeys/nyms and humans on the DC-Net.


Voila.


It's weak and complicated, so I wouldn't call it a "good 
way", but it _is_ a way to have both pseudonymity and
nym-differentiation.



Now that I've done this part, would someone else handle the
perpetual motion, FTL travel, cold fusion and so forth?
Thanks.


Regards,

Bryce
