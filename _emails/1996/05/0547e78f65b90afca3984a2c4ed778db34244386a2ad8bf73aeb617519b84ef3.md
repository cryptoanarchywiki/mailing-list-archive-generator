Just skimmed through it.  Black scientologists should
read it.  More than ever, it points out how Elron
sought corrupt officials, to make deals with, 
subsequently praising them for their venality.

South Africa never was racist, but just cared
about diamonds and gold.  Cheap labor from
apartheid, akin to cheap labor from immigration.

TRIBESMAN.  No doubt he would have a favorable
opinion of Idi Amin, Mugabe(sp), and any other
rich black, as long as they are willing to
part with some of their money.
