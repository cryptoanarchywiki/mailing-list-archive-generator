But there is a very clear contract here.  He rakes your leaves and you pay
him the agreed amount.  If he does not rake, he is in default and you don't
pay him.  If he rakes and you don't pay him, you are in default and he can
probably collect thru small claims court.

I have done consulting work here in Silicon Valley based on such contracts.
 (The value was low and I had assurance, from a mutual friend, that I was
contracting with a man of honor.  I did the work and got paid.)  IMHO, it
beats the hell out of 3 months dealing with corporate legal.
