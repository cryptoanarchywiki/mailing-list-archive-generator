I just dragged out my copy of a book titled "A Bodyguard of Lies," by 
Anthony Cave Brown.  It's a book on the various deception strategems used 
against the Germans in the latter part of WWII.    This deception plan was 
given the code-name, "Bodyguard", because Churchill had said in Tehran that 
"In war-time, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a 
bodyguard of lies."
