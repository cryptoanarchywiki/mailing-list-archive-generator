Nobody pays offshore for Mr. May. They pay a domestic corporation for his
services. The corporation pays Mr. May a sufficient taxable salary for his
domestic expenses. Anything above that (i.e. money that Mr. May don't need
right now) is paid to the offshore entity as (for instance) deductible license
fees. The payment should probably go to a jurisdiction with a double taxation
agreement with the US, like Holland or Ireland. In Ireland it's easy to setup
a tax free corporation that sends all it's income to an offshore trust, where
the money stays until Mr. May needs them.

They just deal with the vice president of a typical domestic consulting
corporation. That the CEO of the company is an alcoholic living on a park
bench (for the ultra cheep setup) is nobody's business. He's on permanent
vacation for all they care.

Only one individual and he's too drunk to remember anything.

Thanks, but I can afford Cuban cigars. I'm selling setup's like the above for
a very nice fee. And this is the kiddie version of serious tax planning. After
all, Mr.May would still pay taxes on his domestic spending.
