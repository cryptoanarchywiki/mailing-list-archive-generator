I'm told the study officially emerges from the National Academy Press as a
book early August.  Until then, apparently, the only available copies will
be a limited number of pre-publication drafts issued at events like the one
scheduled at SRI International, 333 Ravenswood Avenue,  Menlo Park on June
5.

A long way of saying that to get a copy of the whole thing, not a summary,
attend on Wednesday.
