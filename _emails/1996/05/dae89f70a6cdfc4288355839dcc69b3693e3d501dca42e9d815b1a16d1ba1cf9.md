   5-17-96. WaPo: 
 
   "The Code Of the Geeks." 
 
   A longish lifestyles profile of Robert Hayden and his Geek 
   Code -- "a series of letters usually found on the bottom of 
   e-mail messages that, when deciphered, offer a snapshot of 
   the user's geekiness." 
 
      It's a way for geeks to scope out one another. But 
      Hayden says it's a part of his effort to take the eek 
      out of geek -- to turn what's largely thought of as a 
      negative stereotype into something positive. "Gates had 
      an opportunity to be one and he gave it up. That 
      happened when he decided that making money is more 
      important than making good computer code. One geek trait 
      is that you take pride in your work and it's my opinion 
      that Microsoft hasn't produced a lot that's to be proud 
      of." 
 
      "In a nutshell, a nerd is somebody who lets technology 
      run their life and a geek is a person who runs their 
      life with technology."
