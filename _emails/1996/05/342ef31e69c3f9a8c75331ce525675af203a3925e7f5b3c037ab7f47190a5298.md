ROTFLMAO!!!

Since *WHEN*?  (Actually the above is right -- sort of.  This is not a
newsgroup, it is a mailing list.)

One of the reasons I read this list is for the political content.  The
quoted article was information I was interested in reading, and as far as I
am concerned (as if anyone cares), on topic.

You are new here, aren't you... ]:>
