Usura just answered this on alt.privacy.anon-server. The basement
mail2news gateway is temporarily blocking posts from c2.org until the
alt.syntax.tactical forgers go away or can be filtered with new code.

While I publicly whined that SOMETHING needed to be done about the problem
(for PR reasons if nothing else), I'm disappointed that there was no
public announcement of the downtime first. Heck, when Scientology came
knocking, there was an 11-day window before utopia shut down... 

Of course, there's probably more to this than we mere mortals know, so
don't take this as any kind of judgement. (I'm answering mainly to cover
my ass that it ain't totally my fault.)
