If such a device were to exist, you can bet your last e-buck
that the politicians would be the LAST to be tested.  Today,
they ban or highly regulte the PRIVATE use of lie detectors.
The excuse is "reliability," but the various levels of 
government still use them for their own purposes.

With a 100% reliable device, they would either claim
"national security"--the government needs to lie some
times for your own good--or they would rig or evade its
application to themselves.  Count on it.
