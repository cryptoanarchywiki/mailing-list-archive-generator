	Well, the IRS could ask the very sensible question of where is all
this property going to? It's not going to be on the lot of someone is renting
it via ecash. You could claim it had been destroyed, although there are
supposed to be tracking mechanisms for cars. For land, houses, etcetera,
they're going to be suspicious when they find someone living in them. Now,
they may not have enough to prosecute on - but they can keep an eye on the
business' employees + the people driving those cars around or living on that
property to try to catch them doing something illegal; sort of a reverse
Al Capone. If enough people are doing this, this surveilance does become
impractical. But the transitional period is important.
