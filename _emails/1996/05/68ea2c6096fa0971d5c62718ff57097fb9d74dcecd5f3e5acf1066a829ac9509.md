I will point out that as things stand under U.S. law you aren't even
allowed to export toilet paper if the expectation is that the ultimate
customer is on the extreme bad boys list. Although as a libertarian I
find any such provision distasteful I cannot see that we are badly off
if the rules for exporting crypto and exporting toilet paper are
roughtly similar.

I think that is key.
