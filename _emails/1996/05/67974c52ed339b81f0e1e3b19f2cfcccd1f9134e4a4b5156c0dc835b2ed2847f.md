	That would depend on whether the customer can prove a security problem,
because otherwise you're going to get a lot of con artists making a lot of
money off of you.

	One, ever heard of a packet sniffer? If the account holder is on an
Intranet, then someone within it could easily get such information. Two,
somehow I suspect that the penalties for computer breakins are significantly
less than those for bank fraud/grand theft; they aren't going to matter if
you're willing to take the risk.

	Target address and phone number? Make fake ID, get yourself a PO box
and a telephone forwarding/answering service (giving the PO box as the
address), then target it there. Use the fake ID at a check-cashing place. You
can make the fake ID in whatever name you want, which makes it easier.

improvements, which I hope for your stockholders' sake you've implemented.
