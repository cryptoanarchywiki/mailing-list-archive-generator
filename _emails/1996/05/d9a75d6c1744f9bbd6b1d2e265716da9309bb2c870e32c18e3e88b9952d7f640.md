	This appears to be another liberal (e.g., EPIC) vs libertarian
difference. Liberals say we've got to have laws to protect the children, such
as via keeping them from _email_ lists. Libertarians say it's the job of the
parents (and the police, for non-anarchists) to protect the children. Yes,
such lists can be misused (although I see no more reason to say the email ones
can be truly misused than to say the CDA was justified). So can, say,
cryptography.
