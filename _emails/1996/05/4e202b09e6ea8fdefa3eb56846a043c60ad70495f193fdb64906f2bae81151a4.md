Make a grey-scale cable by merging the RGB lines (AND the RGB return lines).
Do not use a standard grey scale cable, these are typically intensity on
green, which you do not want.

Connect the cable and start playing with your colour scheme. The effect you
want to achieve is one where all colours have the same intensity. When that
happens your whole screen should be the a uniform grey area. Revert to the
regular cable and save your palette configuration.

I imagine this would be effective against all of the middle range
van-eck monitoring equipment. It will not be effective against equipment
that looks for phase distortion and signatures in an attempt to
discriminate against the three signals.  Equipment capable of the latter
would be extremely complicated and expensive to design and produce; I
suspect there has been no call for it to date, given that if you are
dealing with a target who understands the risks of van-eck they usually
have shielding and or a faraday cage.

 than  under  omnipotent  moral busybodies,  The robber baron's  cruelty may  
 sometimes sleep,  his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who  
 torment us for own good  will torment us  without end,  for they do so with 
 the approval of their own conscience."    -   C.S. Lewis, _God in the Dock_
