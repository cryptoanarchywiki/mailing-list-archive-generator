Hello,

Does anyone have any real experience running CFS under Linux (1.2.13)?
I was planning to start using it, but am concerned about its
reliability. Has anyone experienced any glitches with CFS?

How does CFS behave in case of a sudden power loss?

Have you tried to use CFS under pre2.0 versions of linux?

Thanks!

	- Igor.
