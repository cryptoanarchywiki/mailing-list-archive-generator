Er...I agree with just about all of Mr Weller's comments, but I wish
he had been a bit more careful in the attribution department.
"Colin Gabriel Hatcher - CyberAngels Director" wrote: "Nor does
freedom increase through less laws or no laws." etc. etc. etc.,
not me. As a partisan Libertarian, I have a reputation to uphold
as an officially designated, Cabal-annoying, ignorant kook. :)
I'm even in Perry's killfile filter. I actually try to lurk,
rather than posting here very frequently, as my thoughts are
more relevant to the political ramifications of strong crypto
than they are to the implementation of strong crypto.
