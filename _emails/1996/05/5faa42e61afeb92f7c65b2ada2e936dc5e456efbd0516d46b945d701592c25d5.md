	Part of this problem may be solved through the proper decisions on
the liability of ISPs for material on them. The concept would seem to be
extensible. If a country has A. good laws on the subject and B. a pretty good
court system - e.g., one in which it's difficult to sue and easy to defend -
that country would seem to be suitable for setting up a remailer front end.
Other remailers can just be used for chaining, and can't be proven to have
carried a message (even unknowingly) without defeat of the remailer system
via traffic analysis. (A reason for remailer operators to run automatic
mailing scripts, BTW.)

	In other words, a remailer that would only forward mail to someone if
the email address in question gave consent? Mailing lists and mail-to-news
gateways can still be signed up by their operators under such a system, and
it's possible the remailer might be charged along with the operator if
copyrighted material was posted.

	How much use is a pseudonym if you can't practically use it for
building reputation capital? It's hard to do that when you can't send to anyone
but individuals, instead of to publically available sources.
	One idea would be bonded pseudonyms. If you put up an adequate bond to
the remailer front end operator (to A. pay fines and B. cover any legal fees),
then you get to send to public fora. This would also be profitable for the
remailer operator, if he/she got to keep the interest (assuming deposit into
some investment).
