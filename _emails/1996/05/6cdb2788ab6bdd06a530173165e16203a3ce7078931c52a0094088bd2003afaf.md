You may recall that when the Leahy encryption bill was proposed, and many 
people around here were fawning all over it, I raised the issue that it 
would allow the govt to harrass and prosecutor encrypted remailer operators 
since their use of encryption allows investigations to be thwarted.  What 
you've just seen, while not directly involving encryption, is the analogous 
version of such harassment with simple remailers.

If there is any need for laws or regulations here, it is one to explicitly 
exempt remailers from responsibility for email they forward, or decrypt and 
then forward.  (It isn't clear, for example, why a remailer is any more 
responsible for the contents of a message than any other point on the 
Internet chain.)

Obligatory AP reference:

If AP was up and functioning, there wouldn't be a government to fund an FBI 
to pay agents to come and harass you for forwarding a message that they've 
probably misinterpreted anyway.
