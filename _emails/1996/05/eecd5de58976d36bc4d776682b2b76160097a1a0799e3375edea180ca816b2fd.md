This is what secure bit-commitment is for.  The refinements to the DC-net
protocol since Chaum's original paper make this a non-issue if you are
willing to spend the CPU cycles to do all of the necessary work.

Or, to rephrase the question in a manner which my lead you to the solutions
which already exists for this problem:  You have an anonymous access channel
in which you need to do frame reservation such that each member can reserve
one and only one frame for the transmission phase which follows frame
reservation. You are both talking about disrupter detection in an anonymous
channel and it has already been solved...

They already have.  Actually, the trap method in Chaum's original paper
is both expensive and flawed.   Get a copy of EuroCrypt 89 and read
the DC nets papers in there by B. den Bos and by Michael Waidner.  If
you are in the Bay Area I have a copy of Pfitzmann and Waidner's "Dining
Cryptographers in the Disco: Unconditional Sender and Recipient Anonymity
with Computational Serviceability" which I would be happy to make copies of.
This is probably the most comprehensively secure DC-net scheme I am aware of;
although, like most Crypto papers, it is way more complicated and
computationally expensive than necessary for real life.
