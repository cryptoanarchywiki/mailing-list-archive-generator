I disagree - paranoia is warranted here.  One problem with our legislative
process is that is is vulnerable to emotional issues.  It is very easy to
bring up issues that sound horrible (child porn, terrorist info, flag
burning), then create legislation controlling them.  Being opposed to this
legislation for whatever reason brands you as "anti-family" or "soft on
crime".  It is clear to me that improperly labeled material will be paraded
before congress and the media as justification for stricter control over
this material.  Congressmen, not wanting to face attack ads claiming that
they support pornography (or terrorism, or whatever), will pass silly laws
such as the CDA.  It has happened before, it is naive to think that it will
not happen again.  There are only three solutions:

        1)  Vote in congressmen that support the first amendment.
        2)  Hope that judges protect our rights.
        3)  Deploy technological solutions that make any laws passed
            ineffectual.

The first solution is improbable and the second is risky.  Only the third
solution actually provides a method where we can really have an impact.  I
think PICS is a great idea, and I think it may have an impact on judicial
decisions.  It should be implemented because it puts the control over
information where it belongs, in the hands of the end-user.  I would hope
that it is a good-enough solution to avoid further control over the
internet, but I have my doubts.  Remember, if congress can try and
legislate against something as innocuous as flag burning, what else would
they be willing to do to curb our right to free speech?
