 Election Hoax
According to a report released by the prestigious Jane's Defense Weekly, the
new missile agreement between Israel and the United States is politically
motivated and does not hold water.

Mr. Christopher Fosi, an Editor of the Jane's Defense Weekly, and Mr.
Douglas Barry,  Aviation and Defense Editor of Flight International Weekly
Magazine,   stated the Nautilus Anti-Missile System is at least 4 years from
being ready. 

The report states the system is "a poor fit or just does not meet Israel's
needs". The report explains that since the Katusha rockets are launched from
mobile sites, they can be moved around in a pick-up truck and this is just
one reason the system is ineffective. Fosi discounts tests that were carried
out in Mexico as not accurate and stated the reasons behind the ceremony
surrounding the new missile deal appear to be political in nature, rather
than a military-defensive move to protect Israel from Hizbullah rockets. 

The report also explains that Israel's Arrow Anti-Missile System is also not
designed for Katusha rockets and is not an effective deterrent.  Despite
promises by President Clinton to supply Israel with an operational Nautilus
system by late 1997, the two experts state it is not reality. (UPI..4/30,
Ma'ariv Newspaper..4/30..Page 2).
