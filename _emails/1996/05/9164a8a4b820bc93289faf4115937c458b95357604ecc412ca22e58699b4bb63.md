Yeah, check out the thread on fight-censorship
(http://fight-censorship.dementia.org/top/) about how the French
paramilitary police arrested two local ISP-businessmen 'cuz their news
spools had alt.sex.pedophilia and whatnot.

I spoke with someone from the French embassy today about this. They say
it was in the course of a child porn investigation. More to come later.
