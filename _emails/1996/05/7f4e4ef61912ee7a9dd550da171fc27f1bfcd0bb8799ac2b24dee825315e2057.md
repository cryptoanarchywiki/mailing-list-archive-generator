Yes, I do!  Because these activities don't just happen by themselves, they 
take the place of other activities which were formerly done in their place.  
The trivial example of sending letters has been replaced by email.  Shopping 
(by foot or by car) is now a web activity. Telecommuting for many is an 
option, and will be more so in the future.   In fact, I would say that one 
of the best results of Internet connectivity has been a strong increase in 
political awareness.  We just recently had the "Tax Freedom Day" which 
should alert you that our own time has been co-opted by government for its 
own ends.  Web activity is low-energy consuming, not particularly risky, and 
is actually fun for many.  Eventually, people may take "Virtual Reality 
Vacations" where they can visit without travel.  Since you spend more time 
at home, you are less subject to crime.

Is this progress?  Damn right it is!  It saves gas, food, human lives, and 
what will eventually be a great deal of money that won't have to be spend on 
transportation facilities.  It will eventually get us out from under the 
yoke of tyranny, which should be the ultimate goal.

True, it's _different_ than what we're used to, but that's okay.  If 
anything, that's why some people will resist it, but that doesn't make them 
right.
