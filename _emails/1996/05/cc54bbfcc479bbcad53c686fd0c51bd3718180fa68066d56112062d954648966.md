We at LolitaWatch GMBH are amused that legislators in the United States are
attempting to legislate that which can be so easily bypassed with the
world-wide Internet.

In fact, anticipating such restrictions on the collection of some data, we
moved our operations to Aalborg, Danmark earlier this year.

(Forslag og ideer vedr. indhold modtages gerne af: www@lolita.nordjyllands .dk )

Danish laws are not so repressive as American laws, and our American
friends can so easily access our data bases of information derived from the
mandatory age-labeling tags you Americans so conveniently (for us) insist
upon.
