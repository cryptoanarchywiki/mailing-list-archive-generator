I now have a cute 2 inch wide by 1 inch high graphic that is the 3 line RSA
Perl program in a 2D barcode.  When printed on anything (postcard, magazine,
etc) you have a machine readable encryption program, or to the US government,
a munition!

Now what to do with this?  Anyone want to place an add in a newspaper or
magazine?  How about selling munitions postcards?  Another T-shirt?  Should
be fun for something.
