	If it was a direct benefit, we'd chose it freely without being drafted
by the use of phone bills. Look at Juno et al - that's a circumstance in which
interconnection is taking place via the free market. Moreover, you're assuming
that there's some reason that I _want_ to be connected to those with
insufficient education, etcetera to move out of the rural areas we're talking
about. I know these places; I grew up in a town surrounded by hillbillies
(Middlesboro, KY). Believe me, I have no desire to have further contact with
them - via the net or any other method.

	My tax dollars (and that's what the proposed phone bill changes
are in many ways - they're government requirements for people to pay money) are
also paying for a lot of other things I don't approve of, such as the drug war.
This isn't a reason to fund more of it.
