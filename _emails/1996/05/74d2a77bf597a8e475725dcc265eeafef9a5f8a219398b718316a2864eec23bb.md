Since no one seemed to mention them, check out Photuris and SKIP.
Both are key management proposals for IPsec.

| take place when one node connects to another node.  The trick is then

| 
| Here are some ideas that I had, but neither is very desireable:
| 
| -  Manual distribution.  User configures every node's key into every node.
|    Configuration becomes a major hassle and mistakes are a pain to debug.
|    An advantagous side effect is the user can configure which machines can 
|    talk to which machines if they're feeling particularly facist.
| 
| -  At connection time, each node determines whether or not it has the other
|    node's key.  If not, a symmetric key is generated via DH and public keys
|    are exchanged.  The problem comes in if someone is spoofing the machine
|    to begin with.  Then you'll have the wrong public key.  Chicken, egg.  
|    Egg, chicken.  
| 
| -  Having a certifying node which every other node has the public key to and
|    who has everyone else's public key.  Requests are made of this server.  
|    The trick is making this server secure and forcing the user to devote
|    resources to this endeavour.
|    
| Thoughts?
