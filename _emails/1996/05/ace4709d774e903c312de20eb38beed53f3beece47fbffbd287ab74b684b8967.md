Well, this depends on what we assume a signature does.

I'm not sure I agree with this "mysticism" of key signatures.  The Senator
can sign an autograph if he likes, why not a key?

"They are corrected because everyone else is an idiot."  Is that about the
thrust of your argument?  While technically it may have some merit, I
think its highly dangerous to legislate and regulate based on assumptions
about what people _may_ think.

This depends on the intrepretation of the meaning of signature.

Precisely, and in the absence of an answer to this question which is more
substantial I think assuming that Senators and CEO's intended to vouch for
your financial or character reputation is stretching it a bit.  But hey,
I'm not on the Ethics Committee.
