Hi, I'm not sure if there was ever a thread on this, but I was wondering if 
anyone can determine your real email address, if you were to fake it to your 
email client.

I hope that this doesn't offend anyone, since this is a high traffic list, but 
I was wondering if this would work.  To try it out, I setup my client to think 
I was someone else, and sent myself an email.  I could only figure out what 
ISP it came from.

What I would like to know is, can any of the experts on this list determine my 
address from the header of this post??

again, if this is something that I shouldn't have done, just let me know, and 
it won't happen again.
