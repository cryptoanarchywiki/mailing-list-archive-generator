Asking someone to "relinquish" is not the only manner in which a change is
effected.  BTW, I have no problem with your proposals for voluntary
insurance, health etc. schemes.  In fact a minimalist state assumes all of
that.  You might want to read up on what classical liberalism is andd what
a minimalist state implies before you spout Rand.
