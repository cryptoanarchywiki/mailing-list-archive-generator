Dial-back does not add security to a system, and in fact, often
reduces system security.

	Dial back takes responsibility for authentication from your
system (where it belongs), and transfers it to the phone company.
Telco switches have a long history of being comprimised.  Assuming a
telco switch gets back to the right number when you're under attack is
bogus.

	Relying on an external system like this is evidence of shoddy
thinking about security issues.  That should have been obvious in the
mid 70's, when telcos knew that their switches were being abused by
phreaks.
