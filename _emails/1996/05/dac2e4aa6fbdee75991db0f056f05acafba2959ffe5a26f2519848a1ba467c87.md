Indeed, this is one of the things I was referring to. To wit, that one can
possibly (emphasis on "possibly," modulo legal actions, a la my point) use
"Metzger's Web of Trust" to effectively discriminate.

(ObCaveat: I personally think a free society cannot/should not outlaw
discrimination in any form, save that by government.)

By the way, this issue has some echoes of another technogical issue: the
use of neural nets for loan approval software. Turns out that when a bunch
of things are entered into a NN loan package, including the all-important
default rate, the applicant's age, income, race, sex, education, employment
history, credit history, etc., that NN loan packages "end up" rejecting
many black applicants, more so than white or Asian applicants. (The NN
"concluded" that blacks were higher risks for default than whites/Asians.)

Even if no human being ever entered his or her biases and prejudices, the
NN spit out this result.

I recall there being talk about requiring "equality of outcomes," and that
such NNs might have to have deliberately-biased inputs fed in, but I don't
know what ever happened to this issue.

In any case, I think this sort of issue, and the semi-related issue of
"discrimination via key signatures," to be likely important issues in the
courts in the coming years.
