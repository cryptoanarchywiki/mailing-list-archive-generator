>From the Proposal:

  "To participate in the network a user needs a public key certificate
  signed by a CA [Certification Authority] 
	
	which 'binds' the user's identity to their public key.
  
  One condition of obtaining a certificate is that sufficient
information 
  (e.g., private keys or other information as appropriate) has been
  escrowed with a certified escrow authority to allow access to a 
  user's data or communications."
......................................................................


Along with the escrow requirement, I keep seeing in here somewhere the
eventuality of a tie being established between public keys and a
national identifying scheme, possibly to update and replace the present
Social Security system.
