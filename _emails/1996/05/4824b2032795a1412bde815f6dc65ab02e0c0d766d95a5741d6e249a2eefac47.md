My clients have a similar testing setup for new communications software. 
It is one way they are able to offer a reliable service to their clients.

All secure systems require perfect implementation of the security kernel. 
Java has a very large security kernel, since it's kernel includes the
kernel in the underlying operating system.  As such, it is probably not
suited for high security environments.*  However, it may well be secure
enough for individuals to run on their private machines.

* If a Java equipped browser is run in a operating system provided secure
environment, this restriction may not apply.  Such an operating system
would have to provide Orange Book A or B level features (mandatory
security).
