On the other hand, if more subtle doctoring escapes your notice....

I disagree.  ID badges and signatures are identification surely, but the
manner and process by which fingerprints are collected and used is
certainly more intrusive.  There is no, for example, national database of
signatures or corporate ID cards.

Which is why clandestine methods are more effective.

Sure, the employer can fire you if they find you out, but they have to
find you out first.

This is why "in your face"ers like Mr. Bell and others tend to fail in
their efforts.  They take the wrecking ball approach rather than run
around the stone in the river.

I think the concept was that it should be done in a way so as to reduce
attention.  10 dead men's prints (provided none were fugitives) might be
an interesting way to go about it.  Certainly less obvious than smearing.

Seems to me that the issue here is not getting fired, but what the
collected identification information will be used for in future.  I
consider spoofing prints and other biometric type information legitimate
if the motive is to avoid later identification for purposes not related to
the employment for which identification was required.

All this "suck it up and get printed" talk has me somewhat disconcerted
with the list.  Have many here not consistantly indicated that privacy is
something that must be self assured?

Isn't this the list that is so paranoid about what might be done with
escrowed keys?  Who might bribe the keepers into releasing such
information?  What might it be used for?  What about corporations selling
information about employees?

How are fingerprints any easier?

One can thing of countless examples in history (carefully avoiding
Godwin's Law in the process) where once legitimate record keeping and
registration was perverted for illicit, even evil use.

I think that unless proper means are taken to safeguard information,
social security number, license plates, and fingerprint records included,
that the individual is perfectly within rights to take his or her own
safeguarding initiatives.

Where those methods are not intended to simply evade prosecution, but
rather to foil extreme recordkeeping, I believe them legitimate.
