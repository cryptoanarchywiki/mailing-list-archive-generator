Yes I do. Several major currency traders in Sweden keep all
their money in 64 bit floating point storage. I think that DigiCash
will go floating point (get real?) when you start doing currency.
If you sell 1 DEM, you don't want to get paid in cents, you want
to get paid in 10-15 decimal places. That's where the currency
action is right now, and before Ecash(tm) is fully deployed we'll
probably see traders going for 15-20 decimal places. Floating
point is the way to do it, but are your accountants ready for it?

Sorry, I thought that the client created the coins and the mint
just signed them. I guess I should go back to RTFAPI.
