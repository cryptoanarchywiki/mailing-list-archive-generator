	Assume that they're gathering all information they can, unless they
make a specific agreement that they aren't doing so. Some magazines have that
as part of their subscriptions - they state that they only exchange mailing
list with certain other parties, wh have agreed that they won't transmit it
further; these magazines (e.g., Consumer Reports) also tend to give people an
opt-out option on even this exchange, incidentally.
