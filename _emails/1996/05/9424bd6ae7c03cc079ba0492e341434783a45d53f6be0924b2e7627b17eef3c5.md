No, because they are too poor to live in your neighborhood.
Sure, they can live in the same geographic region, but it's still
rural and poor. People live where they can afford to live.

Are you saying those poor people in rural West Virgina only live
there because they are not trying hard enough to get out?  
(I'm using rural West Virgina as an example. Many people do get
a good education and move elsewhere, but not all) Don't bother
answering. If you think this is the case, that is your opinion, but
I disagree.

environment, lack of education, lack of money, lots of factors. Nobody
is holding a gun to anybody's head saying "Don't Read". But improving
literacy is a goal that needs to be undertaken. Do you not agree that
low literacy is a bad thing and needs to be taken care of? If not, why
not? Naturally, you can't force someone to read who doesn't want to.
But, why, given a good learning environment and an inspiring teacher
would you not want to?

Some people on this list argue that the current representative govt
system is bad, and that true democracy is better. You can't have true
democracy without education. (You can, but it would be very bad).
True democracy relies on people being educated, the more the better.
(Actually, education benefits the entire society.)

Where is somebody making less than $5000/year going to move to?
(Answer: somewhere rural and poor).  Or, if you prefer, they can
move into tax-payer subsidized housing? (I'd prefer not, thanks)

Then you will be living in a country with lower education standards, 
increasing illiteracy, and a pretty pitiful base with a declining
socio-economic structure. Are you arguing that people are not equal
and those with more money should of necessity get better education? 
Because that's what it sounds like to me. If not, perhaps you would
care to clarify.  You can vote that poor people shouldn't be educated
at all, but that would be worse than paying for them to be more educated.

You don't understand at all. It's not about being people down, it's
about bringing them 'UP'. It's about devaluing lack of education and
striving to improve it. I'm not talking about welfare, medicare, or
any other big govt entitlements. I'm not talking about being meek.
I'm talking about learning to read and multiply 4*9.

I'm not getting into this anymore. It's totally off topic of the list,
but I felt I had to respond to your let-the-poor-be-poor-and-uneducated
posting.

We're straying far off even my point. My point was not that I agree
with subsidizing internet connections for every school in america.
I'd have to be convinced that that is a good thing. However, making
sure everybody has a good education is of paramount importance to
any society. It's going to cost some tax dollars, but, in my opinion
it would be money well spent (unlike building the rural Appalachia
country music museum - which was completely wasted money). I also
point out that there are poor people out there that can't afford to
move from rural out-lands, unless you want them to move into
govt subsidized housing. I'd gladly take the former, wouldn't you?

Not posting any more on this.
