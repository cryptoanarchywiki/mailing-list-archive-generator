   5-12-96. NYPaper:

   "Who's Reading Your E-Mail? Maybe the Boss. More Companies
   Say Messages Are Their Property."

   Reports on various spying policies and employee rights.
   Quotes PRZ demurring: "You don't check your constitutional
   rights at the door." Notes Apple's snooping not.

   And, scare-escrowing, it asks, "what happens if an employee
   encrypts important company documents, and then dies [or is
   fired or extorts]. How will the company get to vital
   information."
