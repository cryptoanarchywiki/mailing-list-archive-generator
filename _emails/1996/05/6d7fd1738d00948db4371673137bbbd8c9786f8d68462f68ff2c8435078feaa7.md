Remember the phrase "social networks analysis".  The FBI seems to use it as
a term of art.

I'm right now listening to Judy Bari on the pirate radio station in Berkeley
(104.1 FM).  She's being interviewed over the telephone and talking about
her court case against the FBI relating to the coverup of the bombing that
she's being charged for.  (It was under her own car seat, for those of you
who know nothing about this.)

In any case, there have been depositions and discoveries in this case, and
one of the revelations was that there was a document the FBI seized (under
circumstances I'm not familiar with) with which they wanted to perform a
social networks analysis upon.  

It was the interviewer's phone and addess book.
