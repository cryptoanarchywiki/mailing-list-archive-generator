	A good Questioned Document Examiner will be able to demonstrate
	that the signed document in question was not authored by Joe 
	Blow, even if it contains his digital signature.  

	Of course, the question becomes one of whether or not
	Joe Blow can afford the $5K he will be charged, to prove
	his innocence.
