How do you create such tiny payments? When I try (2.1.5a MT)
to pay $.001 I receive the warning "Too many digits after '.'!" and
even though it's just a warning I can't do the payment.

Assuming that you had a client that allows tiny amounts, how would
you represent a tenth of a cent in binary? To to it exactly would
require an infinite number of coins...
