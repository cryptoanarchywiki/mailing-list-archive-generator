Certainly refreshing it every few weeks/months is a good idea anyway. It's
just that I (at least) seem to have this remarkable knack for having
important mail try to get me immediately after a nym server goes down and
before I get the news. That's happened to me three times in the last year.

Refreshing deals with the long-term problem, but not with the short-term
one. Maybe I need to settle for a higher level of mail loss than I'm
comfortable with, but precisely because I'm not comfortable with it, I do
remain interested in alternatives.
