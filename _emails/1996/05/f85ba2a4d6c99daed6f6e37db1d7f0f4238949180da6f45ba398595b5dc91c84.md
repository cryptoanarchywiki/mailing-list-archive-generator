Well, you can play all the word-games you want, but many people use the term 
"tax bracket" to mean the amount of tax they pay as a proportion of income.  
(Too bad the IRS hasn't yet defined the term "income"!)    Since 
inflationary gains on assets shouldn't be counted as "income" at all, people 
end up paying a larger proportion of their income as taxes due to this.  Go 
ahead, play games, but ultimately the amount they write on the check will be 
increased as a result of inflation.  I doubt whether they would be in any 
mood to accept a picky technical definition.

It is these people that will eventually decide that it's better to pay money 
to go to government employees' detriment, rather than benefit.
