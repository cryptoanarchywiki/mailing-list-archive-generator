	Would you suspect that having more warning labels (before & after,
not just in the headers) would help with any negative reputation thus
generated?

	You might try pointing out that the only remailing that people see is
for allegedly illegitimate reasons. Psychiatrists who are beginning to interact
with patients over the net certainly have a good cause to use such remailers...
including to prevent governmental tapping, given A. authoritarian governments
such as China (blackmail for espionage purposes, for instance); and B. insane
U.S. legal decisions like the one I heard about on NPR on 5-21, in which a
judge ruled that there was no confidentiality protection prohibiting turning
over psychiatric notes. One wonders what that judge's reaction (and the lawyer
who asked for the notes) would be to having their confidential documents
put into public view... I see no reason to give lawyers more of a privilege
than religious/psychiatric individuals.
