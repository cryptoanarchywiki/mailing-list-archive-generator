MICROSOFT ONLINE BANKING STRATEGY

Microsoft announced that 58 financial institutions have 
committed to offering online banking using Microsoft Money 
through a group of leading banking-software vendors and 
banking-processing companies. To further help banks build 
their online-banking services, Microsoft is readying 
software-component technology for performing secure, 
ATM-like transactions using popular World Wide Web browsers, 
including Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape 
Navigator. These tools to facilitate browser-based banking 
are scheduled to be available by the end of the year. In 
addition, the Microsoft Windows NT Server network operating 
system includes embedded support for Internet publishing, 
helping facilitate an end-to-end Internet banking solution.
