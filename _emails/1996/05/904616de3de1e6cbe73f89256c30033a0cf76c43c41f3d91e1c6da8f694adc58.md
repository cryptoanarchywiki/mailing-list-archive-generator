	Do these sites know that you are using them to mask a remailer? I
would think it would be very bad netiquette to cause a system to be
investigated by some official authority because your remailer was using
them as a front without their express knowledge and permission.

	I would think that obtaining permission would be the least you
could do, but that would also defeat the anomitity by the nature of
notifying the site that you wish to use them. This does not apply to
chaining remailers as by running a remailer, the operator of the remailer
is tacitly giving permission to be used in the chain in most cases.
