Yes, my service provider, DIGEX, is really terrible about
providing access
to my net page.  I'm sorry about this, but if you need more
information,
feel free to write me.

Yes, this was one dilemma I faced with writing the text and I
decided that a "Scientific American" level text would be more
likely to appeal to more people. In fact, my hope is that many
people will be interested in a presentation of this level
because of the political implications. If you can't find the
information, you can't censor it.

I think, though, that there will be plenty of meat on the bones
of this book for many people. Anyone who reads cypherpunks
carefully and works through the mathematical details won't find
much new here, but I don't know if there is much else out there.
The proceedings from the information hiding workshop in
Cambridge will generate some more papers, but that's in the
future.

Of course this should be repeated and amplified. Many people
post great stuff to the cypherpunks list. I couldn't have done
it without you. My only regret is that the best people on the
list might not learn much new from the book. Sigh.
