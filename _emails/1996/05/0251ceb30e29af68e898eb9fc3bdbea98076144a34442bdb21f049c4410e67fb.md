While I believe this correct, it's worth noting that Leahy is fairly
"into" the technology.  He finds it entertaining and "fun."  All of this
mostly thanks to his one time counsel John Podesta.  Thanks Mr. Podesta!

He's one of the more interested congress critters.

Admittedly, not much.  I'm at least pleased he has a decently on the ball
staff however who can tell him what the issues are.
