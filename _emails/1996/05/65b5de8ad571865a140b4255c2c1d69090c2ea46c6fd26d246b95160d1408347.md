There is another angle to this.  If extralegal key escrow accesses
are occurring, it will probably take a long time to come out, if it
ever does.  There's a good chance that anyone successfully
eavesdropping on people by use of the key escrow mechanism will
simply keep quiet about it, and while the victim may *suspect*
what's happened, they won't be able to prove it.  However, forged
signatures *will* be noticed directly, and there will be
high-profile court cases about them.  Even if untrue, serious
allegations of forged signatures based on escrowed signing keys will
make it into the papers, and cause all kinds of chaos.  Presumably,
this is seen by the Feds to balance out the downside that, if I have
the ability to do secure signatures with certificates, I can always
use Diffie-Hellman to establish a secure session with someone else.
