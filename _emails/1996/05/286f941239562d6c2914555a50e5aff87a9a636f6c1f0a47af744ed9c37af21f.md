	Actually, inflation is relevant in a different way. In a system under
which a democratic (or otherwise popularly-influenced) government has some
control over the money supply, some inflation can be used as an invisible tax
going from those who save (primarily those of the middle class and above) to
those whose jobs are affected first by economic downturns (primarily those of
the middle class and below). This has relevance, in regards to privately
produced currencies and digital cash.
