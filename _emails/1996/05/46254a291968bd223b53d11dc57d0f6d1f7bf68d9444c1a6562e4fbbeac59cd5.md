Certain languages, e.g. Smalltalk, and I believe lisp and scheme, have
bignums as a built-in type.  (Or more specifically, their integer types are
limited in size only by available memory.)  I believe these languages are
freely exportable.

Your problem stays here in the good ol' USA.  You can't implement RSA
directly in these languages (I assume RSA in perl has the same problem),
because of the patent restrictions.  Yet another reason to buy a T-shirt.
