My remailer (with source code and spooled messages) is 1.4M.

It will run out of any account. A procmail script could be used to direct
the mail to Mixmaster (or the front end scripts). If you use the account
for other things, you can have the procmail script only forward the
Mixmaster messages.

This could be done with a trivial modification to the source and
destination blocking lists (just change the sense of the checking).
Cyberpass (www.cyberpass.net) offers UNIX accounts without dialin access
for $7 per month. These are available anonymously, and can be paid for with
ecash.

Yes, but I only give it to remailer operators. The "bramble" might get
flooded otherwise. Operators see the repercussions of their actions.
