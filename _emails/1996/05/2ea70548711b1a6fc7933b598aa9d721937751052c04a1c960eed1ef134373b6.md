But even "knowingly" needs to be carefully defined.  A remailer operator 
today KNOWS that his system COULD be used for illegal activities; he merely 
doesn't know that they are, currently.  I think that the definition should 
be so narrow that it is impossible for a third party (or the government 
itself)  to incriminate the remailer operator by having his system forward 
arguably illegal or copyright-violating material.
