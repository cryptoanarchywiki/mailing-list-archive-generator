FAIK, the prohibition on encryption applies only to hams transmitting on amateur radio frequencies.  It wouldn't cover this kind of thing.

I agree that encryption is going to be vital in this case, say 1024-bit RSA or better.  Thus encrypted, it would be even better if the there was also a law which prohibited _the government_ from picking up these transmissions or attempting to decrypt them.

Another useful purpose of such a "supernet" would be alternative telephone system competition.  At this data rate, we're talking about the equivalent of 500+ simultaneous phone call capacity.  That's enough to serve perhaps 5000 homes or more.

Remember, however, that VLSI technology is the company that built Clipper...
