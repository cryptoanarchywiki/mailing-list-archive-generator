	Emailing to Raph Levien (sp?) would seem to be the current way to do
it, as well as announcements on cypherpunks. If we do get increased remailer
turnover, Raph's increasing the frequency of such postings (possibly with
moving the increased-frequency ones to a dedicated mailing list for the
subject) would be advisable.

	It does look like governments really haven't noticed remailers much,
at least publically. I'm sure the NSA, etcetera know about them, but I would
guess they see no reason to give remailers publicity.
