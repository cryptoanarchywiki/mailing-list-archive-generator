In the "normal" protocol, the payee has to go online.  In the "anon" protocol,
the payer has to go online.  Since you don't want to go online when you
walk into a shop, you can pay the shop with the "normal" protocol, and
the shop gives you change with the "anon" protocol.

That way, you never need to go online, and your identity is never compromised.
