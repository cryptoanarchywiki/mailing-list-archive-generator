Nothing.  Perhaps block e-mail from the address the threat mail was sent
from after a certain number of legitimate complaints.

This, of course, depends on the threats/whatever being sent to the
remailer in question as a 'first in chain' mailer.

Ask the recipient if he or she wishes all encrypted mail addressed to his
or her key to be supressed.
