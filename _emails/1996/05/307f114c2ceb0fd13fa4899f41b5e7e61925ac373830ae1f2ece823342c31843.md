	I certainly hope it's user-settable, and settable by each mailing
list.

	That's what I suspected the reason was. Sort of like having mail
instead of post as a default in USENET.

	I've been looking into procmail as a mail filtering mechanism for a
list. It appears possible to handle at least some of the bouncemail via
sending it to the list-manager (looking for things like priority:
list/bulk/junk, for instance). Any further suggestions?
	Incidentally, I've been having problems locating the list-manager
guides for majordomo; yes, I've tried Alta Vista. All I seem to be able to
locate are A. the guides for users - not much use; and B. the FAQ. Sameer?
