	But won't such a company run into tax problems? In other words, the
IRS is going to look with some suspicion on a company that keeps showing no
profits (and thus no taxes) but keeps going anyway. They're going to think that
the owners are making a profit anyway but concealing it - which is the case.
I'm not sure how to handle this one, other than not owning major property
(rental et al).
