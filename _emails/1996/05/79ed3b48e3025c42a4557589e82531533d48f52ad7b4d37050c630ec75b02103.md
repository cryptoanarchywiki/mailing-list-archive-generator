What if you needed to set up a key server for a mass base of customers...
Obviously, authenticating them via e-mail would be difficult, verifying 
them in person would be harder.  Would there be any reasonable way to 
verify hundreds or thousands of customers?  Any manual method would 
be highly undesirable, right?  Imagine the labor involved....but lets 
pretend that the labor is not the deciding factor.  What would be the 
best way to verify the customers keys if you couldn't visit each 
customer in person? 

For example, would a photo copy of a drivers license be enough?

This is a good idea.  The obvious question is:

Would using an "out-of-band means" be worth the time and trouble if 
you had to scale the project to a commercial level?  Would it  
be a show stopper if the keys weren't verified?

Last thought...if the end-user verifies the signature, is that enough
protection?
