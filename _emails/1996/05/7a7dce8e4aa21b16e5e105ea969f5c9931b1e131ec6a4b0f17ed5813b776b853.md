I sent email today to Senators Burns and Leahy thanking them for their work
on this issue, and I'm asking others who support their efforts to do the
same.  They've got some hard work ahead of them to get this bill through, I
think, and I wanted to let them know their efforts are appreciated.

I also pointed out to Senator Leahy, politely but firmly, my concern over
this provision in the ECPA (which he mentioned in his letter, so I'm
assuming he considers it still on the table):

"Whoever willfully endeavors by means of encryption to obstruct, impede, or
prevent the communication of
information in furtherance to a felony which may be prosecuted in a court of
the United States, to an investigative or law enforcement officer shall- 

"(1) in the case of a first conviction, be sentenced to imprisonment for not
more than 5 years, fined under this title, or both; or 
"(2) in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, be sentenced to
imprisonment for not more than 10 years,
fined under this title, or both."
