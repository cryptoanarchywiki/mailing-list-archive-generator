The upgraded Web site for the Association of Federal Defense Attorneys (AFDA)
is now available at http://www.afda.org

The site provides several valuable tools for criminal defense attorneys who
practice in the federal courts:  (1) a convenient compilation of over 100 Web
sites pertaining to federal law, including search capabilities through all
the statutes and case law rulings; (2) an online newsletter that is updated
weekly; (3) a message board; (4) a form library for downloading documents (we
will soon begin uploading documents to the library); (4) a listing of
upcoming seminars for which you can register online; (6) a feedback form so
that you can give us your comments and suggestions; (7) and a survey function
so that we can conduct polls within the criminal defense bar online for
submission to Congress.

The Web site is financed through membership dues on a non-profit basis.
 Until mid-June, the site will be free to all users but will then become
password-protected for members only.  We hope you will take advantage of this
important resource and join the Association so that we can continue providing
the defense bar with needed support.  To join, simply click the "Join AFDA"
bar on the main page of the Web site.

Best regards to all.
