I have no idea how you got this idea.  It is not so.  It sounds like a 
highly garbled version of the rule for the appeal from a **jury 
verdict**.  In such cases you can only appeal the result absent a claim 
of procedural or substantive legal error  if it is so obviously and horribly 
wrong that no rational jury could possibly have come to that conclusion 
on the evidence.  In a jury trial therefore the usual method of appeal is 
to find either an error in the procedure or an error of law in the jury 
instruction, or in the rare case to challenge the law itself as 
unconstitutional.

None of this, however, applies to the CDA case, which is a direct 
challenge to the Constitutional validity of the law, and which is being 
tried before a special three-judge panel of the district court, sitting 
without a jury, pursuant to the special procedure set out in the bill 
itself.  This procedure is used with some regularity for caseds where 
congress realizes that the validity of the law is likely to be questioned.

You can appeal directly on the merits.  And you do so.  The higher court 
decides all questions of law de novo (ie pays no deference ot tyhe 
decision of the court below beyond whatever persuasive power it may 
have), but must accept the factual record as presented ("found") by the 
court below.  Thus the importance of the trial testimony at this stage.
