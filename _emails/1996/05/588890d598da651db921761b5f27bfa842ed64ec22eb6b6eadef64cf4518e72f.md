	This would have two problems (I think :):

1) How do you tell that the source address isn't a remailer?  If
things go to the disposeable remailer heads (Aren't those bad for the
environment or something? :), you might wind up blocking part of the
remailer chain.

2) Depending on the strength the hash function, there's a trail that
you submitted traffic into the remailer network for that 48 hours.
Not that sendmail/packet sniffing wouldn't show the same thing w/o IP
layer encryption . . . .

	Now if there was a DC net you could submit traffic/noise into
that would deliver into the remailer net . . . .
