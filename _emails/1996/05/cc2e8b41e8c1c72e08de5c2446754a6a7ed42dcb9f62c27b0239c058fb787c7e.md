I'd been thinking about it from the opposite point of view: make up a card
game (possibly electronic, like what you're proposing) that acts as intro
to crypto for the untamed hordes of game players. 

As you noticed, Simon, cardgames are a good analogue for cryptography.
They operate on the principle of secrecy/discovery (turning over the
cards), there are analogues for all sorts of algorithms (rules of the
game), we have randomness (shuffling), concepts of authentication (to beat
cheaters, no cards up the sleaves, no color-laser-photocopied Magic
cards...), tokens and smartcards (the cards themselves), integer numbers,
and a whole host of special characters a la Alice, Bob, Trent, etc.
(Kings, Queens, Jacks, Jokers). In short, all the building blocks for
working crypto protocols and their interfaces, needing no introduction for
most people. I can sort of even see a representation of a public card scheme
with signatures and certs (I'll have to go grab a deck and try).

Presumably, given a careful choice rules one could do for crypto what
Solitaire did for Windows 3.1 . I see no reason why a card game could not
be an interface for pgp or remailers, or an easier demonstration for
DC-nets, blinding or complicated market protocols. One might even build a
programming language out of such building blocks (probably for scripting).
Poker for Java--Do not Export! (If the CJR for the RSA-Perl T-shirt was
absurd wait till the authorities get stuck with this one.) (Mind you, I 
probably wouldn't use an imperative language like Java for the scripting, 
but that's just me.)

This is of course all idle speculation, 'cause I'm lazy and have neither 
the time nor the expertise. It's all yours folks.
