The *most recent* draft version of the white paper -- not the early 5/10
version that I quoted from but the one publicly released yesterday -- is
available at http://www.epic.org/

We should thank the good folks at EPIC, those swell touch-typists, for
taking the time to put the paper online, along with their comments on it.
