There's an interesting proposal for a study at ORNL about
key management for multicast applications.  Unfortunately,
the ietf drafts on the protocol itself have expired :-),
but there are a couple of Postscript papers pointed to by
Tom Dunigan's really extensive reference list
        http://www.epm.ornl.gov/~dunigan/security.html

The ORNL proposal is at http://www.epm.ornl.gov/~sgb/mvpnet.html

ABSTRACT
This proposal focuses on providing security in a multicast-based network
such as the mbone. The proposed solution is application-based and works 
with all IP-multicast based routing protocols. It utilizes the group-oriented 
key management (GKMP) protocol which provides greater scaleability by removing
the need for a separate key distribution center. Secondly, we look at ways 
of securing IP multicast from denial of service attacks.
......
The first step in implementing a secure multicast capability is the ability 
to provide group access control and a scaleable efficient key distribution
meshanism.
We propose implementing the Group-oriented Key Management (GKMP) protocol as the
core of our group access scheme. GKMP currently only exists as a beta version 
at SPARTA. GKMP has become an experimental RFC and the code will be made
publicly
available by SPARTA.
