This is because any analysis of political opinion that tries to reduce it
to a one dimensional metric is ipso facto wrong.  Two dimensions gives you
a much better match.  (Try personal freedom on one axis and economic
freedom on the other.)  I suspect the more dimensions you include, the
better you analysis will be.
