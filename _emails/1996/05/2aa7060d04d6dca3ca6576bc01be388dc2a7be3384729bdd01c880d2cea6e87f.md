I agree that this could be the single most important piece of legislation to
affect the cypherpunks ever -- firmly defining the legal status of
encryption (and in our favor, no less!)  However, did anyone actually read
it (it's at
http://www.cdt.org/crypto/pro_CODE_bill.html )?  Here's a nice bit of section 2:

]SEC.2.FINDING;PURPOSE
]
]   (a) FINDINGS. - The Congress finds the following:
]          
]           (1) The ability to digitize information makes
]        carrying out tremendous amounts of commerce and 
]        personal communication electronically possible.
]           (2) Miniaturization, disturbed computing, and
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
]        reduced transmission costs make communication via
]        electronic networks a reality.

I think "disturbed computing" pretty much sums up this list, if not the
entire net!  :-)
