   As complement to the ONE_two article on the NIST team's 
   latest work on quantum logic gates, we note that Malcolm 
   Browne also reported last August on parallel work at MIT. 
 
   We have put that article (keyed then as CAT_tal) at our 
   rickety Web site: 
 
      http://pwp/usa.pipeline.com/~jya/cattal.txt 
 
   Also, Signal magazine reported on this area of research in 
   its April 1996 issue at: 
 
      http://www.us.net/signal/CurrentIssue/April/ 
      Quantum-apr.html
