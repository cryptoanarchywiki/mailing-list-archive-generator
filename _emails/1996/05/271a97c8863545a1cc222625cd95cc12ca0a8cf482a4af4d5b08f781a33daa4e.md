The International Trafficking in Arms Regulations laws that prohibit
export of strong crypto make exceptions for equipment/software
to be used in banks and other financial institutions, as long as
the banks behave themselves.  Exporting for general use is different.

Sun's original "Secure NFS" used 192-bit DH keys, and was cracked by
Brian LaMacchia and Andy Odlyzko; there's a well-known paper about
this available somewhere (I think research.att.com?).  192 is way too short.
512 is probably too short.  128 bits is amazingly irresponsible.
The attack they use spends most of its time precomputing information about
the modulus and generator, and only a small part of the time attacking the
specific exponent that was used - this means that an attacker who cracks one
exponent using that modulus can easily crack the any others.
