But as long as key-escrow is claimed to be "voluntary," then the police 
should be happy if it is used at all.  If they object that it is possible 
somebody won't agree that the person involved shouldn't have his data 
revealed, we can remind them that the jury system prevents conviction if not 
all of the jury agrees as to guilt.  This is no worse than having, say, 12 
key-escrow organizations and allowing any one to not reveal the correct key. 
 Naturally, it will be necessary to ensure that they can refuse without 
anyone else knowing who opted out...
