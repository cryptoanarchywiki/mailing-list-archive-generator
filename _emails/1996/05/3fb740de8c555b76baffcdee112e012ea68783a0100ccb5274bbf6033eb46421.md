But this does not prove that _all_ messages from Bob came from Alice. The
only messages the Church can prove went through Alice, are the messages
they themselves sent through Alice. 

It would not help the Church to say "We know our trade-secret Mystical
Clam Chowder Recipie went through the Alice remailer, because we sent it
through that remailer ourselves." Also, Alice could also demonstrate
sending a message through Bob without using the Alice remailer at all. 

I am assuming that in this hypothetical situation, remailers themselves
are not illegal, but the owners are held responisble for what goes through
them. I am also assuming that Bob does not have any records that show the
offending message coming from Alice.
