If Perry and a couple of his competitors got together, called themselves 
a professional organization, and issued a press release and guidelines, 
they'd probably be able to have a big impact.  I'll bet they could get it 
picked up in the WSJ, and probably some other papers as well.

"People in environments where security matters (like finance and banking)
shouldn't use java or javascript.  If you want to use the web to reach
these people, don't use java or javascript in your pages."

As stupid as it sounds, sending letters to the people who maintain the www
faqs might be helpful to.  Most web designers would probably follow
guidelines if they knew what they were.  I'll bet that a lot of people 
who write web books will take a look at the faqs, and you might get wider 
coverage through them.
