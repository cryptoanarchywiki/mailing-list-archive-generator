	It is my understanding that IP spoofing will become much more
difficult, if not impossible when IP6/whatever gets put into place. It
seems to me that IP spoofing is not a long term option. 

	Deep Thought Question for the Constitutional Scholars:

	What chance would a remailer operator have in the court system
today positing the following set of circumstances:

	1. Case is concerns retrans of either copyrighted/trade secret
material (i.e. CO$ shit) or basically anything _but_ child porn or a
murder contract.
	
	2. Remailer operator did not violate any laws. 

	3. Remailer operator has big enough legal guns (ala EFF & ACLU
etc.) to back him.

	I realize that this would be a civil case rather than a criminal
one, maybe it would have to be child porn or something illegal to get that
far, but if I were to set up a remailer under my real name, and the CO$
came after me, given that I had the financial backup to carry the case to
trial, what are my chances? 
	Would it be worth it to do a Scopes Monkey Trial like case on
this, get someone willing to take the chance, and establish that it _is_
legal to run a remailer? I might be willing to be the test case for this,
but I would need to know the ramifications, and I would need to get my
wifes approval for this, and I don't want to expose Suba to any liability
in this. (So relax Alex).
