Why does anyone need his public key to communicate with Senator Leahy? If
it's for sender-anonymity, this does not do it, though other tools
(remailers) do.

Unless the information is "secret," why bother? It adds extra time at his
office's end (you don't think Leahy types in his password to PGP do you?),
and it accomplishes little.

used to get PGP-encrypted messages which had no earthly reason to be
encrypted, except that people apparently wanted to practice their PGP
skills. (For those who sent me items that had a reason to be encrypted, you
know who you are and you know this comment does not apply to you.)
