	I suspect that it is rather unlikely that the court would find a
remailer operator covered by those laws.

	This is related to the old ISP liability question, although amplified
by being not only a practical impossibility to filter but close to a physical
impossibility also. (Please note the "close" part.) I am not sure if a judge
could find any grounds to slap a remailer operator with contempt of court in
such a case, but if it were so, Uni has pointed out that it's rather difficult
to override a judge in such a matter, even based on plain facts.
