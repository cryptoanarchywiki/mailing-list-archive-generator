	Given discussions as to attorneys holding passphrases, et al, perhaps
a tutorial from the lawyers on the list (yourself and others, since
disagreements among J.D.'s have been known to happen) on what attorney-client
confidentiality does cover?

	Most of them aren't anonymous, either... although that does give me
the thought of going to one outside the US and its reporting requirements.
They'd know who I was (or at least the address it was going to), but at least
nobody else would know. Any suggestions, since you've been writing of the joys
of nymdom recently?
