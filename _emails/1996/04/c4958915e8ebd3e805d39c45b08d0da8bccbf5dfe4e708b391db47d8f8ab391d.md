Sure, compressibility is not a determinant of randomness....nothing is,
actually. This is my point about there being no simple definition of
randomness.

However, "most" objects derived from a "random-like process" have no
shorter description than themselves, by a variant of the pigeonhole
principle (i.e., there are more things of some size than descriptions of
less than that size, so most "random" objects, are, perforce, not
describable in short descriptions).
