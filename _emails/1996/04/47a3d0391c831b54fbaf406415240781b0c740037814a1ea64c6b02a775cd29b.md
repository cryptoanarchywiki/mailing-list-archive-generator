If it's been done, it won't likely make any difference. Information that would 
affirm or refute the existence of an investigation by law enforcement is 
exempt from FOIA.

>From sgs@well.com:


 Have the cypherpunks requested data on whether they are being investigated
 by the same agencies under the FOIA individually or as a group listed by
 that name? If so, what are the results, if any, so far?


Does anyone know if this has been done? The FOIA, that is.
