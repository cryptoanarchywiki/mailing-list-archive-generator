I used to recommend that passwords be a phrase of at least 15 characters. 
Spaces fall naturally into that model.  If your spelling is as bad as mine,
then your password is resistant to dictionary attacks.

However, then I discovered that there are many brain damaged systems which
restrict passwords to 8 characters.  (e.g. IBM's VM/ESA, Netcom's UNIX) 
For those systems, I can only parrot the conventional wisdom, no words,
include numbers and/or punctuation, no acronyms, include both upper and
lower case, etc. etc.
