Huh?  I don't follow your reasoning.

If you use two random words, the search space for a dictionary attack
with an N word dictionary is N^2.  That's true whether you include a space
or leave it out.  If you use "random punctuation" and the punctuation
character is unknown, you add perhaps a factor 20, which is so much smaller
than N that it isn't worth arguing about.

Two-word passphrases are pretty good, and if you feel uncomfortable
with an N^2 work factor, use three words to get N^3.  That's a much bigger
win than talking about random punctuation characters.
