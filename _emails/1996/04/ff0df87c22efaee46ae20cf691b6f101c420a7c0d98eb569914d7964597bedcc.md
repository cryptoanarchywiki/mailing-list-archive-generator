	On the contrary, just as the increased communications let 
opponents know about the legislation, it also lets the proponents know, 
and they supposedly send faxes and email in support.

	Literacy rates are dropping, the High School Dropout rates are on 
the rise. Hell, listen to talk radio for a while, and you tell me if 
these are the people YOU want running the country. They are motivated 
enough to call in and/or vote, but they aren't motivated enough to 
actually stop and think about the subject, much less learn about it. 
	I am not saying that the average person can't make good 
decesions, only that many of them are not equipped to sort out the 
complexites, nor are they willing to think long term about things. 
Unfortunately this is also true of our leadership.
