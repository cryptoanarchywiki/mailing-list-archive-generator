KJ> Subject: Re: unsubscrive

  I didn't keep the article, but there was a fairly recent post to
the risks digest that mentioned that someone somewhere has set up an
automated address grabber/spoofer of subscribe messages for several
high volume mailing lists.  This assumption was based on the large
number of subscribers being added to the list, who were then complaining
that they had never asked to be added to the list.

  Since the cypherpunks list is a rather high volume list, it shouldn't
be surprising that it may become a tool for annoying people unfamiliar
with mailing lists.

  Regards, Dave Hodgins.

  P.S.  To unsubscribe from the cypherpunks mailing list, send a message
addressed to 
majordomo@toad.com 
  with
unsubscribe cypherpunks
 
  in the body of the message.  the subject is ignored.
