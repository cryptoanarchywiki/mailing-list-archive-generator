# It's hard.  I'd really rather have longer pass{words,phrases} so that there's
# the potential for lots of entropy without requiring line-noise for passwords.

One of the ideas that I've been kicking around in the back of my head for a
while for stronger, easier to uses user authentication goes something like
this:

1) User enters a pass-phrase.

2) System "tokenizes" the pass-phrase.
   The tokenization would probably include a normalization step: condensing
   white-space and punctuation, standardizing the casing of words, perhaps 
   even going so far as converting 3133+ speak to something readable.

   Once normalized, the pass-phrase would be parsed, and tokenized.  It would
   be useful to have a large system-wide dictionary, sorted by how common a 
   given word or group of words is normally used in the most commonly used 
   languages that the system's users speak/write.  Any word or group of words
   found in the dictionary would be converted to a number, representing its
   position in the dictionary, and the significant bits of that number are 
   concatenated to a running bit string.  Words and tokens not found in the
   dictionary would pass through some other algorithm that I haven't thought
   too much about, yet.

3A) System examines the tokenized pass-phrase against another (probably _very_
    large) dictionary of common phrases for acceptability.  (maybe just
    comparing the hashes of the phrases [smaller dictionary])

    System also examines the "length" of the tokenized pass-phrase for 
    acceptability (for pass-phrase changes.)

3B) System hashes the tokenized pass-phrase, and compares it against the
    previously stored hash (for authentication.)
    [ Standard crypt(3) stuff ]

Ignoring the fact that strong one-time-passwords are orders of magnitude 
better, what would something like this buy you?

0) "Good" pass-phases should be more difficult to brute-force or inteligently
    attack than simple (8 or 16 byte) passwords.  [ rm /usr/local/bin/crack ]

1) Pass-phrases are generally easier to remember than system-generated
   passwords.  [ no more post-its pasted to screens or hidden under keyboards
   with passwords written on them. ]

2) Pass-phrases can be a pain to type in correctly, the normalization step
   should help in this regard.  [ happier users ]
   
3) Enforcement of selecting good pass-phrases is difficult.  This scheme
   addresses _some_ of the issues involved.  [ The next generation of 'crack'
   won't have a foothold - happier security officers. ]
