Agorics is a company devoted to commercializing these ideas (Mark
Miller is one of the founders.  They're building a language for this
called Joule with some interesting properties.  Electric Communities
(http://www.communities.com), a "sister" company, has rolled a number
of these ideas into E, an extension of Java for safe, distributed
communications.

This is a pretty good summation, without the slides.  What I'd add,
though is that I want the smart agents to be our WWW browsers (whose
intelligence I can extend either through local development or by
retrieving software over the Web).  I want the browser to be the
gateway integrating my local environment with the big world out there
and I want it defending my interests.  (I also want to get rid of the
word "browser" because it is too limited.)

If the Web is going to support social interactions and growth to a
zillion nodes, it has to move from a client/server architecture (good
for a browsing human) to a peer-to-peer architecture, like EDI, but
without requiring ISO or ANSI approval to do anything ('cause my agent
will do most of the browsing of the 100 potentially interesting sites
).  We need a "meta-standard" for creating and combining
domain-specific "mini-standards," and let the mini-standards battle it
out in the marketplace.  SGML and IDL are two potential
meta-standards.  Java provides a way to communicate base line
functionality the first time I see a new standard.

At the bottom of my home page are two recent paper submissions on
this.  The first ("Beyond the Write-Only Web") might be particularly
interesting to this group as it talks about how to make a
self-modifying malicious Java applet in the spirit of Ken Thompson's
Turing Award Lecture.
