Why nothing.  Even your employer has done a bit of this protocol "forcing".
The actual question though is would a successor organization(s) do anything
significantly different.  The question is can a *government* order
protocols.  IBM couldn't (after a while).  If the government can't order
protocols and protocols are created by (rough) mutual consent, I'll be happy
and Dorothy won't be.
