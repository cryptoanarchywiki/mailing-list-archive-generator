Thanks for taking the time to tell me so.

It's muddled.

The key seems to be the nature and purpose of the sanctions.  (And mostly 
the purpose).

As a very general rule of thumb (as these tend to be case by case 
analysis) when the sanctions are punative, intended to punish past 
conduct and not influence future conduct, contempt sanctions are 
"criminal" and require due process and other protections.

Where contempt sanctions are intended to effect compliance with court 
orders, or are the result of disruptive or destructive behavior that 
interferes with a court's proceedings (withholding testomony, outbursts 
or insulting behavior in the court, withholding evidence, refusal to 
appear), contempt sanctions are civil, and can be leveled on the spot 
without any protections or review.

Historically, and in my experience, criminal defendants are given a lot 
more leeway.  No judge is going to push constitutional rights with 
contempt sanctions.  If, however, in the judge's view there are not 
constitutional rights which apply, defendant's are just as likely to get 
smacked.  (One example that comes to mind is where the defendant waived 
his Fifth Amendment rights, then refused to testify anyhow.  Prosecution 
objected and asked for contempt sanctions [for which there was a very 
good argument, the waiver was quite explicit and the prosecution had 
based a good deal of argument on it and defendant's existing 
testomony already.]  The judge refused to level contempt, prosecution 
appealed the decision immediately and we went all the way to oral 
argument before the appeals court upheld the judge's decision.  The 
appeals court judge cited specifically the importance of leeway in 
criminal cases and refused to find clear error).

These are generally only after an explicit waiver of fifth amendement 
rights, or when they clearly, quite clearly, do not apply.  I'll dig up 
cites if there is enough interest.

To trigger Fifth amendment rights, an act must be testimonial, and 
incriminating.  I discussed it a bit in my note on asset concealing.  
I've reproduced the passage below:

The cases following In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 814 F.2d 791 (1st
Cir. 1987) demonstrate how the fifth amendment has been eroded or
eliminated in application to this problem.  In the In re case the
defendant was directed by the district court to sign a consent form
permitting the disclosure and production by a financial institution of
documents protected by Singapore banking secrecy law.  On refusing to
sign, the defendant was held in contempt.  The investigation alleged
reporting and currency violations.  The defendant appealed to the
First Circuit which held the signature as both "testimonial" and
"self-incriminating."  The court reasoned that the consent form
"amounts to an assertion" that the bank customer consented to
production of the requested records and that it was "self-
incriminating" because it could be used to demonstrate incriminating
facts (e.g., that the accounts in the witness's name existed and were
within the witness's control).  Even at the time, however, this
decision was in conflict with the Second, Fifth and Eleventh circuits,
which have held such an order does not violate the fifth amendment.
(Typically on the grounds that the forms signed were non-testimonial).

Lately, clever prosecutors and private litigants have evaded the
testimonial hitch entirely by phrasing their consent forms in the
hypothetical, and not naming specific account names or numbers.  The
Supreme Court upheld the order of contempt for a defendant refusing to
sign such a document.  See, Doe v. United States, 108 S. Ct. 2341
(1988).  The Court noted that the form was carefully drafted not to
make reference to a specific account, but only to speak in the
hypothetical.

[...]

For more examples See also, United States v. Davis, 767 F.2d at 1040
(holding any problem of testimonial self-incrimination is solved by
such an order precluding use of directive as admission); In re Grand
Jury Proceedings, 814 F.2d at 795 (expressly approving of reasoning in
Davis); United States v. A Grand Jury Witness, 811 F.2d 114, 117 (2d
Cir. 1987); United States v. Cid-Molina, 767 F.2d 1131, 1132 (5th Cir
1985); United States v. Ghidoni, 732 F.2d 814, 818 (11th Cir.), cert.
denied, 469 U.S. 932 (1984); United States v. Browne, 624 F. Supp.
245, 248 (N.D.N.Y. 1985); United States v. Quigg, 48 A.F.T.R.2d 81-
5953, 5955 (D. Vt. 1981).

If there is enough interest, I will do a small note on the distinctions 
that have been important to courts in compelling production of 
potentially incriminating evidence.

I have seen a court compell the production of safety deposit box keys in a
criminal case when those boxes were suspected to hold the fruits of a 
crime and the court had acknowledged the defendant's possesion of the 
key, and ownership of the box as well as the potential incriminating 
nature of the boxes contents.  A per day fine was imposed.  If you want 
specifics I'll attempt to get a waiver from the client and pass them on.
