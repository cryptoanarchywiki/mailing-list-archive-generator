I understand from an AP reporter that the judge in the Bernstein
challenge to the ITAR refuesed the motion to dismiss and -- if the
reporter is correct -- held that source code is First amendment speech.
This appears to conflict with the Karn decision that dismissed a somewhat
similar challenge to the ITAR on political question grounds.
