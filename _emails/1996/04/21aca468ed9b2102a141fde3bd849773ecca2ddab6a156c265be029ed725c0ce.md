Maybe these dweebs are posting from an alternate universe? A universe in
which not even messages explaining that "unsubscrive," "unsuscribe,"
"undescribe," "unscribe," and "unimbibe" are not valid alternate spellings
of "unsubscribe."

I've copied my short explanation of how to subscribe and unsubcribe too
many times to do it again; and it is clear that these folks are either
doing this out of spite, are not reading any of the messages we send them,
or think it funny.

This may kill off the Cypherpunks list even where Detweiler's massive rants
failed. (Now that Detweiler's cabin in Montana has been raided, and one of
his tentacles carried off, who will fill his shoes? Vlad the VZNuri is well
on his way to matching Detweiler's volume, if not his obsessiveness.)
