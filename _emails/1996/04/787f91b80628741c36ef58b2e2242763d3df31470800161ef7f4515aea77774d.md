Instead I'm going to ask the author to look up "taxable event."  Seems 
Mr. Bell now has an LL.M. in taxation.

This assumes that the e-cash is never converted into anything other than 
more e-cash.  It also assumes that the IRS will not assess taxes on 
currency held in a foreign denomination by converting it (theoretically) 
to U.S. currency values first.  In fact this is precisely what is done.  
If the e-cash you are holding in your pocket, or whatever, changes 
dramaticaly in value because of a change in currency rate, then that's 
profit.

If Mr. Bell's supposition were true I could make 20 million dollars 
speculating on DM or SwFr and never pay the IRS so long as I didn't 
convert the currency to U.S. denominations.

I hope Mr. Bell is correct in this, but the battle is not over yet.
U.S. banks will almost certainly not participate in a totally anonymous 
e-cash scheme any time in the next pair of decades.  Offshore banks will 
be the key.
