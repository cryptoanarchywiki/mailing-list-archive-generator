His ISP was Netcom. Klemesrud respresents Netcom.

This was without a doubt just a user of one of Hal Finney's remailers he
runs out of an account at Caltech. (There's a tiny chance it was someone
else, but it fits the description of Hal's "alumni" remailer exactly, and
is almost certainly just that.)

This is a Cypherpunk-style remailer, and Hal is one of the original Cypherpunks.

The concept of "The poster has never been heard from again" is essentially
meaningless, unless he or she or signed the message and established a
persistent personna.

Sorry to sound picky, but I've just seen several messages all of which copy
a long dialog from some Finnish guy named Kaj. Some of the messages then
confuse the issues by confusing the types of remailers.
