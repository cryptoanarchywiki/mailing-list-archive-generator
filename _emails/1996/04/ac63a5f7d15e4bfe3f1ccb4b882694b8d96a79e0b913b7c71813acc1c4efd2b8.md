Perhaps Mr. Bell would have been happier if I had said "bring forth a 
motion calling for measures to deal with the defendant's supposed 
conduct in bad faith in answering the discovery requests presented by the 
plaintiff."  Somehow, however, I doubt it.

Like I told Mr. Bell before, when he starts paying my hourly rate, I will 
copyedit all my posts.

This requires the assumption that all the data is already encrypted, not 
an assumption a prosecutor or private litigant is about to make.  The 
case will then become one of a defendant with a reputation for concealing 
or otherwise destroying evidence, and a private litigant would be quite 
justified in calling for measures to preserve what evidence might have 
thusfar survived encryption.

Well then, next time I am involved in a civil or criminal case I will just 
suggest that the defendant simply encrypt all his documents, burn the paper 
and then turn over the cyphertext to the plaintiff to comply with 
discovery.  Now the plaintiff will be powerless to touch us.  In a 
criminal case, the defendant will be protected completely from 
prosecution by the Fifth Amendment.  I will win _every case_, I will be 
famous!  They will call for me all over the world.  I will then use my 
profits to buy a massive ice maker, and freeze the planet's water 
supply.  Those humans will have to come to me for their precious 
commodity.  We can make billions on the sale of ice melters, and the 
franchise rights to our chain of fast water stores will be 
priceless!  We will _take over the world_.

Muwahahaha.
