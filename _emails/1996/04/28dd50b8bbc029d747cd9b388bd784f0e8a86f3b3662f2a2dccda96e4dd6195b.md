Ooo! Ooo! Let's go back to the 9-bit bytes! The ninth bit could be the 
adult/minor flag!

Let's toss away all of our computers! Buy new equipment! Just to 
accomodate the CDA! 

The ninth bit would be perfect for this! Every single byte could be 
flagged as Adult or Minor!

Every byte with a value > 255 would be only available to adults. If you
use numbers > 255, then the 9th bit would be set, and we would know you're
an adult since minors can't count to 256! 

Small print:
The "9th bit adult/minor flag" is the intellectual property of Steve Reid.
Unauthorized users of the "9th bit adult/minor flag" will be prosecuted 
to the fullest extent of the law.
