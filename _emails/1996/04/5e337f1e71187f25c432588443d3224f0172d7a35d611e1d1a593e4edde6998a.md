Declan - 

One of the migration paths suggested for IPV4 to IPV6 migration is to
tunnel IPV4 packets within IPV6 packets.  IPV4 packets do not provide for
an adult/minor tag, so until the transition to IPV6 is fairly well along,
this approach will be ineffective.

If the people who are worried about minor's accessing smut want something
this century, they should go with PICS.
