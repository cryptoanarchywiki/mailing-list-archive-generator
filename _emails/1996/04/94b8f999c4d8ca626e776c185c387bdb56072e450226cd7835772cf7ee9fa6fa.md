No.  The 5.1 bit figure is averaged over the whole damn keyspace.
If you pick a random 40 bit key (not necessarily a weak key), and
I apply the Andrew Woos attack, I can guess your key with 2^{40-5.1}
= 2^34.9 work factor, on average.

Look.  1 in 256 keys are weak.  For a weak key, you have a 1/7.35 = 13.6%
chance of recovering 16 bits of the key.  This is an advantage for the
attacker, as 2^16 / (256*7.35) = 34.8 = 2^5.1 > 1.

Suppose you called keys with the last byte 0x4A jamesd-weak.  1 in 256
keys are jamesd-weak.  For a jamesd-weak key, you have a 1.0 = 100% chance
of recovering 8 bits of the key.  This is not an advantage for the attacker,
as 2^8 / (256*1.0) = 1.0.

Keep an open mind,
