Sure.  Because 1) it's a good algorithm for the job,
2) we've learned it, and have a PGP base behind our inertia,
3) The legalities of RSA are well-defined,
4) the Stanford patents mostly run out in 1997, unless Roger's suit
        succeeds first,
5) the price of RSA is fairly low, once free RSAREF came out
6) the price of licensing Cylink patents is high and/or unpredictable
