I've just doubled the number of international net-censorship efforts
that I track on my web page: <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~declan/zambia/>.

Included are new updates reporting on Germany, France, Australia,
Singapore, Canada, and China, among others. Please send me reports on
countries I've missed!

     France, China, Germany, Singapore, Jordan, the U.S., and many other
     countries are moving towards tighter control of the Internet. France
     and Germany want to see an international agreement of information
     controls emerge. Recently China required all of its estimated 40,000
     Internet users to register at the local police station. This
     international crackdown marks a turning point in the development of
     the Net.
