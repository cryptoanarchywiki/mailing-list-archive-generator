	In some cases (such as my lone message, which was Cc'd to cypherpunks),
they may be simply using a mail reader that doesn't allow retention of
the threading reply header without sending it to the address of the original
message. (Since these same mail readers, such as mine, also usually don't use
the threading information, this is an act of charity.)

	I'm going to be mailing some replies on this topic to some people,
off the list; if anyone is curious and wishes to receive them also, let me
know (off-list).
