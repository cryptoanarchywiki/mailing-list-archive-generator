Smooth move.  You just published your home address to about 1000 people, 
all of whom are suspected of being involved in a nation-wide moon pie 
theft clique.  Expect weirdness.  Ignore the knocks on your door late at 
night.  Do not feed or water the on-going Cypherpunks meeting and party 
that is about to manifest itself in your front yard.  If you do, they'll 
never go away.

Enjoy being in the archives for all time.  Impress your friends by doing 
a WWW search on your name and actually having a hit returned by the 
search engine.

Well, thanks very much.  You, too.  And remember, DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR 
FOR STRANGERS!
