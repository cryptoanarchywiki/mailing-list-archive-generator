No, I refused to reply to your obvious troll the first time, or to the
various Nazi tracts that have been posted anonymously recently. You had to
repeat the off-topic smears twice before I decided to humor you.

All presenting one point of view, stated less strongly than your link
text. There have been all sorts of opposing points of view, letters to the

As I told you on February 9th, I am win-announce@metrics.com.
