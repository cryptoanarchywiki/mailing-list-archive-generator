I don't know the answer to this question, but there is a pgp-users
mailing list where someone might know.  Here's how to subscribe:

	"To subscribe to the list, simply e-mail "pgp-users-request
@rivertown.net" with the word "subscribe" in the subject **NOT THE BODY** of
the e-mail and you will be automatically subscribed to the list. To
subscribe to the digest, sent your request to "pgp-users-d-
request@rivertown.net" and your subscription will be likewise processed.
Depending on list volume, digests will go out from once a day to several
times a day."
