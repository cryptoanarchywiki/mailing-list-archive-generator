I wonder how they can get the e-mail address? Our finger daemon are 
blocked. Many un-broadcast e-mail addresses (the account never send any 
e-mails to anyone) are in the database. How?
Furthermore, isn't it also privacy invasion? 
Would any hackers or expert people kindly to tell me how to block 
further threat like this? Or tell me the way they do it, and I'll try to 
think the way to prevent it in the future.

Sincerely,
Sent.
