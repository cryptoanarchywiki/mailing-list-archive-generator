The rest of this article is a direct quotation from Blaze et al in the
paper they wrote on minimal safe key lengths. Note that they show that
it is easy enough to make a cracker that costs eight cents (CENTS!)
per solution, and not that hard to get it down to 1/10th of a cent!

Full paper at:
ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/mab/keylength.txt

}    There is no need to have the resources of an institution of higher
}education at hand, however.  Anyone with a modicum of computer
}expertise and a few hundred dollars would be able to attack 40-bit
}encryption much faster.  An FPGA chip --- costing approximately $400
}mounted on a card --- would on average recover a 40-bit key in five
}hours.  Assuming the FPGA lasts three years and is used continuously
}to find keys, the average cost per key is eight cents.
}
}    A more determined commercial predator, prepared to spend $10,000
}for a set-up with 25 ORCA chips, can find 40-bit keys in an average of
}12 minutes, at the same average eight cent cost.  Spending more money
}to buy more chips reduces the time accordingly:  $300,000 results in
}a solution in an average of 24 seconds; $10,000,000 results in an
}average solution in 0.7 seconds.
}
}    As already noted, a corporation with substantial resources can
}design and commission custom chips that are much faster.  By doing
}this, a company spending $300,000 could find the right 40-bit key in
}an average of 0.18 seconds at 1/10th of a cent per solution; a larger
}company or government agency willing to spend $10,000,000 could find
}the right key on average in 0.005 seconds (again at 1/10th of a cent
}per solution).  (Note that the cost per solution remains constant
}because we have conservatively assumed constant costs for chip
}acquisition --- in fact increasing the quantities purchased of a
}custom chip reduces the average chip cost as the initial design and
}set-up costs are spread over a greater number of chips.)
