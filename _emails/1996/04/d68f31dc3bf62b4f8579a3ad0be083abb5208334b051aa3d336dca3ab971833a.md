In a message dated 96-04-17 02:35:51 EDT, you write:

>Knowledge about TCP/IP is alot easier to control than knowledge about the
>Berlin Wall (ie, how many Chinese will even know of the existence of TCP/IP
>-- in the US, where this is freely available, how many citizens know of it's
>existence)?

I bet this would change if people saw knowledge of TCP/IP as the "key to the
Berlin Wall."
