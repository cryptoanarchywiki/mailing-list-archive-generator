I know Raph already answered this, but I want to toss my few cents in.

It is important to understand the threat model of Mixmaster. I assumed that
all links and some remailers would be compromised. My goal was to ensure
that no information about the message was revealed except to the first and
last remailers in the chain. To borrow from physics (black hole)
terminology, the message must have no hair.

Any active padding by the remailer implies that it knows an upper limit on
the size of the actual message. If each remailer removes some information,
which must be replaced, then conspiring remailers can obtain information
about the where messages are going, by comparing size, and knowing that the
"kernel" of the message can only shrink.

This last statement is true unless remailers add extra hops, which they
encrypt. The reason this is not effective has been thoroughly discussed on
this list.

Take a look at the essay on my home page. It explains most of the design
decisions.
