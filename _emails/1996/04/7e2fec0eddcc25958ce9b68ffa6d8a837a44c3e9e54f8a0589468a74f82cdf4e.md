    Time's dual attack on Hillary, one orchestrated by someone she  
tried to control, the other just pure analysis of the situation is very  
surprising. they are part of the big-money NWO whose "duty" is to keep  
the sheep informed of the will of the government (and make it appear  
benevolent. 
 
	However, let's face it, Hillary has guts: 
 
   	    "Bill Gates is greedy because he has amassed a fortune of 
        	US$ 15,000,000,000 ($15 billion) 
   	    but the US Government is a helpful Village because it takes 
        	US$ 1,400,000,000,000 ($1.4 trillion) from us each year 
        	and does good things with it." 
                	--Hillary Clinton 
 
    that takes one bitch of a person to make that arrogant statement  
--and the  cover picture tells it all --ridden hard and put away wet  
many, many times --and not in the conventional sense.  Susan Thosases  
and she make a real pair. 
    Their actions, or those of Bubba and the rest of the CFR of which  
george Bush is the hatchet man, show an absolute contempt for the  
Constitution.

    politics of assassination?  hired guns?  I do not think I would  
have any difficulty with the concept in theory; just that we would run  
out of targets too soon and be forced back to economic terrorism.  I do  
know, WITHOUT A DOUBT, that I will NOT participate in such a matter. 

    The prophet, Joseph Smith said: 
 
	    The Constitution is not a law, but it empowers the people  
	to make laws... The Constitution tells us what shall not be  
	lawful tender... The legislture has ceded up to us the  
	privilege of enacting such laws as are not inconsitent with the  
	Constitution of the United States... The different states, and 
	even the Congress itself have passed many laws diametrically  
	contrary to the Constitution of the United States. 
	    ...Shall we be such fools as to be governed by its laws,  
	which are unconstitutional? No!... The Constitution  
	acknowledges that the people have all the power not reserved to  
	itself. I am a lawyer. I am a big lawyer and comprehend heaven,  
	earth, and hell. to bring forth knowledge that shall  
	cover up all lawyers, doctors, and other big bodies. This is  
	the doctrine of the Constitution, so help me God.... 
 
    Now, this may not agree with your thinking (and there are pages  
more of Joseph Smith's statements on defending the Constitution), but I  
think he hit it on the head.  Secondly, Thomas Jefferson stated: 
 
	    "I hold it that a little rebellion, now and then, 
    	is a good thing, and as necessary in the political 
    	world as storms in the physical... It is a medicine 
    	necessary for the sound health of government" 
        	--Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) 
 
    or maybe: 
 
	    Democracy is a form of government under which everyone 
    	has the freedom to elect officials to restrict his freedom. 
 
 
    or to put in more succintly, I think an old Doonesbury cartoon that  
had Duke (representing the NRA) testifying before a Senate subcommittee  
summed it up    nicely..... 
 
    	    Senator: "And we and the American people have had enough of  
	you and your fanatic organization!" 
 
	    Duke: "I see Senator, shall I put you down for a million  
	postcards?" 
 
	    Senator: "Don't you threaten me, mister!" 
 
	Politicians only understand one thing. 
 
 
   I am not a pacifist; I do believe in fighting for what is right; I  
did my duty in the 60s (in spades) --I could have asked the Church for  
the CO form; after the way the government used us (particularly the  
"black" battalionsfor which I was the CO) solely to test new weaponry  
and build up the military-industrial economics, by 1980 it hit me as to  
the extent I, and the rest of us, had been betrayed, 
 
    yes, our government has a problem: greed, and power. 
 
    Joseph Smith, however, did say: 
 
	    The Constitution should contain a provision that every  
	officer of the Government who should neglect or refuse to 
	extend the protection guaranteed in the Constitution should be 
	subject to caputal punishment, and then the President of the 
	United States would not say, "Your cause is just, but I  
	can do nothing for you." 
 
    Anarchy which degenerates to mob rule is untenable.  What I do not  
see in your treatises is any planning for the future --once mob rule  
reigns, the next step is tribal councils, chiefs, and chiefs of chiefs  
--and I do not mean elected chiefs. As it has been, it will be.  Man  
never learns from history --he just repeats it. 
 
	 


-- 
  "Don't hunt wild game, hunt lawyers! 
    They provide better sport, 
      suffer from severe overpopulation, 
        and besides, they taste just like chicken!!

 Obscenity  is a crutch  for inarticulate motherfuckers.
 Fuck the CDA!
