No.  "Those who sacrifice security for freedom, will have neither" is
not consistent with Franklin's statement, nor is it true.  Security and
freedom are antithetical, and worse than that, security is always an
illusion.  But you can have your illusion, as long as you keep it out of
my life.  Censor yourself if you wish, but don't censor anything I might
want to look up.

Yeah, right.

Although you don't seem to have mastered propaganda quite yet.
