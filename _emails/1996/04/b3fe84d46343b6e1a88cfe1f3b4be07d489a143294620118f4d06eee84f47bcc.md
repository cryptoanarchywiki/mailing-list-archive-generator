It's called "S/A" (Selective Availability) which is the NWO term for adding 
errors that "authorized" users can remove. (Not to be confused with A/S, or 
anti-spoofing)   It was originally intended to be turned on in wartime to 
deny the enemy accurate fixes, but during the Gulf War military GPS 
receivers were so scarce that the soldiers had to use commercial products, 
so the S/A actually was turned OFF then!

Since then, pressure has been building to turn off S/A, since its usefulness 
is nearly zero.  Even so, the amplitude of S/A errors are only a little 
larger than natural errors caused by satellite timing errors, atmospheric 
propagation variations, etc.  The result is that DGPS is useful, which is 
(more or less) a fixed antenna and GPS system which knows where it is, and 
subtracts where it "seems" to be by GPS every second, and broadcasts the 
resulting error data on some terrestrial system to receivers locally.  The 
result is errors down to the 1-meter level and even lower.  That system 
compensates for both natural errors and S/A, so the whole purpose of having 
S/A is negated.  Eventually S/A will probably be turned off permanently, but 
even then we'll want to continue to use DGPS systems.

Denning's trust for the government is apparently boundless.
