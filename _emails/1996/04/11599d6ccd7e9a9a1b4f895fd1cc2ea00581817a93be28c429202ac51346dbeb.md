Who says?  Unicorn started by making an unbelievable challenge (especially 
given the fact that he, unlike I, is anonymous) and THEN he claimed that he 
didn't believe we'd ever agree to terms, etc.

This sounds like weaseling to me.  Let Unicorn FIRST identify himself.  Then 
we'll see who's "weaseling."
