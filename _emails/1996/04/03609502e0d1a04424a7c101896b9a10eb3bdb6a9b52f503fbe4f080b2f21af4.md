While taking to anon.penet.fi will help, the one to talk to is the list
owner and ask them to clean up their act. They should either reject any
attempt to use ANxxx@anon.penet.fi IDs in lieu of the correct
NAxxx@anon.penet.fi form, automatically convert the registration to
NAxxx@anon.penet.fi, or parse the membership list for ANxxx@anon.penet.fi
IDs and fix them to the NAxxx form. If the list is run by Majordomo, there
is a patch that fixes the problem by correcting the address list [or it may
be outgoing address] (and I think keeping it clean at subscribe time).
