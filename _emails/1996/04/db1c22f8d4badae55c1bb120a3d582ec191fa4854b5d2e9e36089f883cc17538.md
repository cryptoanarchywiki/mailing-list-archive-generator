I think I tried to cover too many bases at once.  Ecash _is_ currency, 
it is not _a_ currency.

This means that outside of the formal definition acording to BSA which 
says that currency is the stuff we carry around and nothing else, that 
ecash generated coins function as a currency in that one can make purchases 
on a peer to peer basis, and appears to have the migration path 
necessary to exist in an offline world as well.  To me this makes it 
currency.

It is not a currency.  One sees many articles and posts (not yours) that 
refer to ecash as though it were not USD or some other store of value. 
In this case I mean that ecash is the software that moves and stores 
money like a check, or more precisely like a money order, but is not 
in itself _a_ currency.

Exactly - I agree.  Take a look at contracts like loans until 
Roosevelt closed the gold window in the early thirties.  They said 
things like "you owe $100 or the equivalent of X.xx ounces of gold.  
With the revaluation of the US currency in terms of gold in the 30s 
there was a specific potion of the bill that disallowed these terms 
in contracts since the devaluation could not effectively take place 
otherwise (ref - Jim Grant).

No quarrel here - but I think it is easier to build a competing 
lending institution where the business gives you money and you 
promise toi give it back, than it is to build confidence in a deposit 
institution where you give money and hope to get it back.  I take my 
original commnet as a positive.

Sure, this is like free banking in the 1800 - Fed KC traded at a discount to 
Fed NY or vice versa depending on attitude at the time.

In the old days there was an automatic balance when a government 
inflated - the metal standard attached.  If inflation got out of hand 
people would show up at the window with bills asking for the gold or 
silver equivalent - when the government gave out too much metal it 
had to behave.

I would like to note that I am a big supported of private currencies. 
 We have had many discussions on the topic and I have had the 
academic side covered by folks who wrote papers as far back as the 
50s on how to do it.  As ecash is accepted in the mainstream by 
multi-issuing interoperable banks I expect to spend more time on this 
topic - for now I need to get  on with the conventional version.

Great ideas!
