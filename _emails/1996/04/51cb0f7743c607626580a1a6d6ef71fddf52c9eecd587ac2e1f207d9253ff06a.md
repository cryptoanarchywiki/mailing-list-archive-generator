	So your conditions are US Supreme Court rulings, that
	handwriting exemplars are not fifth amendment violations.

	Those only occured in the middle of the Twentieth Century.   
	I don't think anybody is going to come up with an earlier 
	citation than that.

	C19, which made such a ruling.  It was only in C20 that
