	I disagree strongly about the advisability of this.  If we
demonstrate the utter weakness of 40 bit keys, the US business
community will scream for a better solution.  With a little correct
publicity, like that provided by the BSA, and backed by most companies
security folks who understand the ludicrousness of the law, the NSA
comes up looking like jackasses.

	Anyway, I've found your comments to be very interesting &
informative, and this was a small nit.
