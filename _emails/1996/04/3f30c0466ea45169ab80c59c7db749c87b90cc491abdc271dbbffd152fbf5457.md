	Quite. I can see clear justifications for, say, allowing whatever money
is spent on private security as a tax deduction. Unfortunately, the PC
egalitarian types who don't seem to realize that inequality is a fact of life
will claim that this will give the poor worse security than the rich. Yes...
and the rich are the ones who need the most security. One, they're the banks:
they're where the money is. Two, the rich tend to be the smarter ones, and thus
the most valuable.

	I would guess that most instances of violations of banking secrecy,
wiretaps, et al fall into this category also.
