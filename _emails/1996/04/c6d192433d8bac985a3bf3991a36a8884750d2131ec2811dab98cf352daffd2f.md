You are asuming that the (underage) user wouldn't route his packets thru an
offshore packet bit scrubber that some freedom-loving student set up to do
the bit scrubbing.  It is not even clear that any of the parties is
violating the law:

  The content provider is correctly labeling his packets.
  The transport agents are correctly passing them along.
  The bit scribber is running where such activities aren't illegal

The further you move the control from the home/school into the internet the
easier it is to subvert because there are more places to subvert it, more
people motivated to subvert it, and less control of the environment.
