It amazes me that this is new news.  I've been watching this since the mid
80s.

The earliest of these decisions dates back to the 60s.  Good morning
reporters.  Have a nice nap?

What has consistently alarmed me is the United States trend of extending
her own moral and ethical standards world wide.  Granted the United States
is the foremost world economic power, but the power to control markets and
the political power to invade the sovereignty of other states are two
distinct issues.  The United States is, in one form or another, attempting
to homogonize the legal systems of the world to comply with her own
concept of what is "right" or "fair."  This is disturbing.

I will not go so far as to propose that this is some grand conspiracy or
some "one world government" plot.  I will comment, however, that what
started with concepts of anti-trust, and progressed into the field of
securities regulation, has (publically) become an issue of banking
secrecy and cryptography.

By no means are the states of the world united on the meaning of
anti-trust, the appropriate levels of regulation therein, or the manner in
which to enforce these segments of the law.  That the United States should
seek to impose her own will and concepts on foreign states strikes me as
the antithesis of this once noble power's call, indeed the central focus
of her foreign policy, for the self determination of all nation states.

One sees a larger trend.  The dream of European unification, many
times attempted attempted militarily (France, Napoleon, Germany), then
politico-economically (The European Union) has become a global legal
financial reform effort led by the United States.

While from the prespective of the United States, the position seems
rational, what is constantly ignored is the imposition on foreign states,
particularly those with a long culture of independent and unintrusive
legal regimes.  (Switzerland, Austria, Sweden have all felt the pressure
from the United States of late).

Perhaps unwittingly, under the guise of protecting her shores from 'Money
Laundering,' 'Narco-Terrorism,' Terrorism and any number of international
criminal problems, the United States appears to be a united front for
worldwide financial legal reform.

It is my prediction that this policy, which ignores the international
comity between nations, will severely disadvantage the country in the
years and decades to come.

Mr. May (I believe) on this list predicted the inevitable clash between
strong cryptography and the technologies and capacities it creates and
statist trends.  I join in his assesment.

Private banking in cyberspace is in its infancy.  At the moment
institutions are identified, have a geographical base, and depend on the
graces of a single host state to exist.  Many or most institutions hold
significant assets within the borders of the United States, and still
others derive a large portion of their income from U.S. branches.  These
days will not last forever.

The introduction of a geographically diverse, multi-jurisdiction, crypto
and secret sharing institution with completely blinded assets assured and
accountable merely through blind digital signatures is around the corner.
Such an institution will be impervious to the whims of the United States
or any other power.  She may even hold stock secretly in U.S.
institutions, offer mutual funds investing in U.S. stocks, and yet remain
beyond the reach of the legal systems and intelligence apperatus of the
western world.

It is my vision to create such a system.

Any individual understanding the jargon of intelligence will appreciate
the meaning of this statement.  What is being called for here is the 
application of the full brunt of intelligence assets and even covert
actions to enforce that which cannot be enforced by law alone.

As do tax attornies, multi-national corporations, wealthy individuals, and
import-export traders.  The United States has become expert in the process
of criminalizing the act of being a criminal.

A dangerous, frightening concept.  Akin to worldwide application of the
RICO act.

And that prudent banker might have been told by the CIA to shut up or take
a walk.

BCCIs problem was that the prosecutors in Miami and the Federal system
never bothered to do any work until the Iran Contra scandal.  This despite
constant allegations and indications of major frauds.

BCCI is a poor example because it involved corrupt bankers who formed the
bank with the intent of defrauding depositors and investors, not a bank
which was merely annoying to the tax authorities of the United States.

Which reality?  That the United States wants access to the financial
records of anyone and everyone on the planet?

Neither are walls, envelopes, whispers or any other manner of secret
keeping.  Correct?  Haven't we seen this before?

If prosecutors would do their job and concentrate on the crimes themselves
as opposed to reforming the entire international financial system to make
their work a bit easier, noone would be concerned.

Financial investigations are a crutch for poor prosecutors.

Jurisdiction over the Manhattan bank, fine.  What are you going to do?
Invade Vanatu?
