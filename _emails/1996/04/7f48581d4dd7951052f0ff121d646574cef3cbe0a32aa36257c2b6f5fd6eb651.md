The context is Unix passwords, which are limited to 8 characters,
not arbitrary-length passphrases like PGP uses.  The size of the
dictionary of words you can use to put two of into 8 characters
is fairly small; the natural choice for two words with a space is
a 4-letter word and a 3-letter word, both chosen from English dictionaries,
though 5/2 and 6/1 are also possible.  It's _way_ searchable,
even if you're not attracted to popular phrases like "Exon You" or "Oh Exon!".

If you're length-constrained, the choice of one word limits the maximum
length of the other.  If you take away another character for punctuation
or space, it reduces it even more.  If I were writing this on a Unix box,
I'd check the number of words in the appropriate length categories, but it's
pretty low, and there's probably a lot less entropy in 3-character words than 4.
