Oooh... forged headers... forged to indicate they're coming from _my_ 
school. I wonder who _this_ could be... perhaps someone who has expressed 
anger at me on the list? Perhaps just a random choice? Perhaps me? (Not 
me, that I'll tell you...)

Sure, this will effectively hide the data; so will a plain old encrypted 
partition...

But that's what a contempt charge is _for_: "You're not treating me with 
respect, so I'm going to punish you." It might be described as being for 
a particular reason (ie supressing evidence), but each of those reasons 
ultimately boils down to lack of respect.

In addition, were I handing down (or prosecuting) the contempt charges, I'd 
claim that the statement (even if it was made in public) that the individual 
didn't know all the keys in the first place was a lie, and that, by repeating 
the lie, they were purjuring themself.

I am not a lawyer; however, I suspect that neither was the anonymous poster.

In fact, I think I have a pretty good idea of who it was: someone on the 
list who:

(1) Has recently been claiming that contempt charges were worthless, and that
    people should start ISPs, and pool money for insurance.

(2) Has (probably) used this technique (at least once) before to create the
    appearances of support for one of his/her ideas which really has no 
    support.

(3) Might _possibly_ be upset with me (due to the headers...)

I can't think of _anyone_ who meets THAT description, now can I? ;-)
