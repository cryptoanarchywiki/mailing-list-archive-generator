I also run e$pam, where I filter the e$-relevant stuff from cypherpunks and
about 50 (don't hold your breath, there isn't that much else out there,
yet) other sources. The total e$pam mail feed is about 30-50% (depends on
the day) of the cypherpunk total.

The e$ home-page is:

http://thumper.vmeng.com

e$pam is sponsored, so individual subscriptions are free.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
