"Fair use" is very tricky. The Church of Scientology files lawsuits against
even those that mention that Saint Ron believed the Key to Becoming Clear
lay in communicating with plants.

And if the editors of a newspaper want to file suit, they can. In fact,
newspapers don't necessarily have more copyright rights than others do.
What if a person like me demands that an archive site remove articles by
me? I have not signed any waivers authorizing an archive site to
distribute, sell, trade, or otherwise disperse my articles! (Recall the
controversy some years back when a compilation of jokes from rec.humor.*
was sold, without compensation to the joke authors.

Changes are being proposed in copyright law. Maybe good, maybe bad. I don't
follow the controversy.
