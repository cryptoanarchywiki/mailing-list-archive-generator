Well, I worked on SQUIDs (Superconducting quantum-interferometric devices)
in 1972-3, and also worked on electron-beam analysis of microprocessors and
memory device in 1980-84, and I can assure you that SQUIDs cannot do what
you want them to do.

I'll be happy to supply additional details if there's sufficient interest.
