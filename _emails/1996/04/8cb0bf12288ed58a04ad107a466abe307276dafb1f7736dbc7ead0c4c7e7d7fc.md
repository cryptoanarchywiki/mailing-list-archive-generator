Yeah, that's sweet. I'm concerned that it might paint too glowing a
picture of Japanese civil liberties, though.

NOTE: -LOlsen (I'm speaking beyond my experience)

It was my impression that the Japanese response to the Aum Shinrikyo
terrorist gassing was more draconian and one-sided than the US response to
the Oklahoma City bombing. For all the doomsday talk, you must acknowledge
that the "anti-terrorism" bill was stalled for a full year by an odd
coalition of right-wing and civil-liberties groups. I have not heard about
such political discussions in Japan. The police seemed to have carte
blanche to ban the cult, seize its assets, and investigate and/or arrest
anyone associated with it. 

If I'm misinformed, please enlighten me.

It's certainly true that internationalization usually means openness,
which usually means privacy and freedom.
