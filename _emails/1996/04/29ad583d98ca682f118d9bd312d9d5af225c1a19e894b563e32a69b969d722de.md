Well, I don't view any of the "simple definitions" of randomness as
especially useful; that is, the simple definitions have a kind of
circularity (implicit in the points we both make). For example, "an object
is "random" if it has no shorter description than itself," the classic
Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin definition, is quite elegant, but doesn't
help much in many cases. Because even this definition needs to be fleshed
out, thought about, pondered, and explored, this is why I said "there can
be no simple definition of entropy, or randomness, for an arbitrary set of
things."

Maybe you would say a simple definition does exist, but that interpreting
that definition and applying it to a set of things is harder....a
difference, I think, of emphasis. I hold that in looking at some object
(set, sequence, string, etc.) and asking "Is it random?," the very question
is misleading. It may _appear_ to be random to me, or to a particular
machine which is unable to find a compression (= shorter description,
implying nonrandomness), but someone else or some other program may find
the compression.

The same book. I rely on carbon-based memory.

By the way, Greg Chaitin has a new version of his "Universal Turing
Machine" system implemented in JavaScript. At:

http://www.research.ibm.com/people/c/chaitin/nv/index.html

(Here I rely on non-carbon-based cut-and-paste.)
