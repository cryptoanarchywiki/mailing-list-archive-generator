This analysis seems to assume that the entire production run of a standard 
product is subverted.  More likely,I think, an organization like the NSA 
might build a pin-compatible version of an existing, commonly-used product 
like a keyboard encoder chip that is designed to transmit (by RFI signals) 
the contents of what is typed at the keyboard.  It's simple, it's hard to 
detect, and it gets what they want.
