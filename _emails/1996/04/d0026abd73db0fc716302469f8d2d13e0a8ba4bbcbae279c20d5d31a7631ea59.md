I do not recall anyone accusing you of statism on the SMC call to cut
Nazi net access -- probably because I deleted all that tedious crap, 
not because nobody accused you.

I and others accused you of statism on various other matters, such as
your claim that those who fail to pay taxes steal from society, and I just
accused you of always changing the subject to Nazism whenever somebody
accuses you of statism.

And I also accused you of talking about Nazism much too much.

And what happened:  You immediately changed the subject to Nazism.

Cut the nazism, please.  Statism is sometimes on topic.  Nazism will
not be on topic until the next serious threat to Nazi's net access.
