I confess I had a good laugh at Jim Bell's expense. His attempt at
weaseling was sadly uninspired, and Black Unicorn was quite right to
move in for the kill.

But to be fair to Jim Bell, perhaps $100 is still too high? I mean this
in complete seriousness: I have to come up with nearly $2,000 cash by
this weekend, and I wouldn't be able to make such a wager at this time,
no matter how right I felt I was.
