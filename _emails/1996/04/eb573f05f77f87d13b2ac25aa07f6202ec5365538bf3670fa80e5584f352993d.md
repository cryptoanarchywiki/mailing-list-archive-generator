Does anyone else get a little upset at the thought of one Government agency
(DoD) spending money to install the GPS system, then making it less accurate
than it should be, and then a second Government agency (US Coast Guard)
spending money to improve the system by installing DGPS stations. Plus, in
order to get the real accuracy of GPS right now I have to spend more money
on a much more expensive DGPS unit.

Pisses me right the F### off.
