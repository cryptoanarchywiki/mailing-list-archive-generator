If, for whatever reason, you decide to license RC4 from RSA, you have two
options: you can license BSAFE from RSA, or you can license RSAREF from
Consensus Development, which will soon be available with an RC4/RC2
implementation. Costs vary.

It's my understanding that RSA has threatened legal action against anyone
shipping RC4 without a license, but I don't know of any lawsuits that have
been filed.
