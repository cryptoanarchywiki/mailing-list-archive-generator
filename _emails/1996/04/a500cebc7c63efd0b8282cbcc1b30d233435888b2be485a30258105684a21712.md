At least partially broken, yes. I've forgotten the details. I believe
they were discussed at Eurocrypt. It may be that with the full number
of rounds that no one yet has a cryptanalysis but I don't recall and
it doesn't particularly matter from my perspective.

I was unaware that PGPPhone used Blowfish, but if it does that was a
stupid idea in the first place.
