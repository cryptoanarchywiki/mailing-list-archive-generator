You cannot test for entropy, not can you test for randomness.

You can however test for particular kinds of non randomness 
and particular kinds of lack of entropy.

Such tests are only useful if you have an adequately understood
source of entropy.

Each such test is only appropriate for particular sources of
entropy.
