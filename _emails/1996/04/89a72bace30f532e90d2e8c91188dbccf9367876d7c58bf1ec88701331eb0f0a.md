And bear in mind that "enthusiasm" does not mean certitude. We've all
gotten enthusiastic at times about some Next Big Thing. I count this
enthusiasm as part of the larger Web picture, which is unlikely to fizzle
out.

If you mean "Microsoft Office," I wasn't really thinking of this. The point
this person I cited (I don't remember who it was) was that this makes it
easier for a application to get "shelf space," because the shelf is the
Web. Payment is problematic, but distribution should be easy.

Obviously, Mosaic (and then Netscape) was a good example of this. A small
team, or even a single person, with a Good Idea, gets distribution. The Net
and Unix have long had this (with Unix tools and languages), but the Web
and applets may well extend this to a broader base.

We'll see.

I think the interesting target date to plan for is a year from now.

Shouldn't be any worse or any better than with the status quo, right? I'm
not sure I see the Java issue. (I've been looking at SoundClip and
AudioClip, but only cursorily.)

By the way, Hal Finney is working on a bignum package.
