    I have been reading this list to get an idea where Declan gets some
of his lunatic ideas and what Rich Graves says when he is not up to
Holocaust fetishism.  Despite Timothy's claim to the contrary, it seems
that the basic point of this list is some libertarian notion that tax
evasion is a good thing.  While I am not clear how serious of threat, if
one at all, to a system of fair taxiation, since much of the talk could
be simply bluff, I have been made glad for the first time for the War on
Drugs.  This silly war--tragic in terms of its economic cost and its
assault on liberty--at least has forces some government agencies to take
you seriously enough to figure out how to derail your plans of tax
evasion.
