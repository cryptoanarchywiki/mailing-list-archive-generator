I did a search for "sybase.com" and, while there were no e-mail addresses
of Sybase employees, I now know of a bunch of places running Sybase
software.  At least, I presume so, since they have an account named sybase.

Also, a search on root turned up this particularly entertaining entry...

http://people.whowhere.com/pages/ask@ist.flinders.edu.au

Is this one of the people who volunteered their own information?
