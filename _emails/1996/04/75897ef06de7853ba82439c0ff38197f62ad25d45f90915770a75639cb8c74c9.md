It's not a useful estimate of entropy, and I don't see what you mean
by "`weak key' type data".  There are no keys or PRNGs involved here,
just a hash function.  Now, if you've got a sufficiently compressible
data stream, compression may be a fast way to jump-start the
distillation, but you absolutely need a priori information on the
entropy of the source.

If your definition of entropy is at least as strong as Kolmogorov
complexity, it's infeasible to compute.  The way to measure entropy is
to spend ten years trying to understand the data source, and hope that
no one else can afford to spend twenty.
