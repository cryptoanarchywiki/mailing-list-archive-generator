   Security Management, published by the American Society for
   Industrial Security, has two articles on computer security
   in its April, 1996, issue:

   "Legal Lessons in the Computer Age," by Mark D. Rasch,
   J.D., director of information security law and policy with
   SAIC, and former DoJ prosecutor of Robert Tappan Morris. A
   tabloid on tabloiding computer crime to hacker-phobics.

      This snapshot of current law and court rulings gives
      security professionals a glimpse into the evolving legal
      landscape that companies must be prepared to negotiate
      when pursuing those who might attempt to steal or damage
      computerized systems or information. (30kb)

   "E-Mail Policy By the Letter," by Fred L. Trickey, an
   information security officer at Columbia University. An
   account of good e-mail policies and procedures, with
   salient references, and a sidebar on E-mail gawking.
   (24kb)
