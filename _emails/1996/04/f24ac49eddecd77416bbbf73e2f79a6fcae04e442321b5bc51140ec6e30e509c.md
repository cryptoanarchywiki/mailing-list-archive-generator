If Tim is claiming anything to the contrary it is the importance of defending
tax evasion on this list. There isn't any. Its acceptance is a foregone 
conclusion around here. The place for debating the ethics of such 
things is on usenet political groups. The focus here is using crypto to build
the institutions to escape the constraints of physical commerce and 
monitoring. Obviously, for the practical purposes of most people we 
aren't there yet. It's quite promising, though. It's not the "why" but 
the "how". 

It might be useful for you to browse the early portions of the archives 
when they come back or read Tim's and Eric's original manifestos
(somewhere in the bowels of ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/rants)
and Black Unicorn's essay on his love of cash from Detweiler's page
(can't remeber the url, I'll dig it up if you're interested, it's got
some nice outtakes from past discussions, though Det himself is 
rather out of it). The cyphernomicon is also instructive (it'll show up 
on search engines). There are tons of other good sources, too. 

Ps. I know there are other list archives, but none of the urls I dig up 
seem to work. Help!
