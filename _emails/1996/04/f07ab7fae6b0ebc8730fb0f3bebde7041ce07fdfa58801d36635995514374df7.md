I'd like a shot at this...

I sort of blurted this at the coin-BOF at CFP96, and I think I'll still own
up to it, viz,

When money finally goes onto the net, and never comes back, the digital
bearer certificates we call ecash will be a currency. Until then, it's just
a script.

Or is it an interestless bond? ;-).

Cheers,
