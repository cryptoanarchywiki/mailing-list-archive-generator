	People might want to take a look at Rabbi Hier (the founder of the
Weisental Center)'s statements on "hate groups" and the Internet. While he
(unlike Biden) does recognize that outlawing bomb-making information would be
unconstitutional, he doesn't appear to approve of anonymnity on the Internet
(nor, depending on how one interprets his statements, of encrypted
communications without GAK). The first is to his (and the Weisenthal Center's)
credit; the second is not. The URL is:

http://www.wiesenthal.com/itn/hiertest.htm

	I came across it while looking for information re: militias and
racism. As my previous information had caused me to believe, some militias are
racist (or anti-Semitic), some are racial separatist, and some are neither.
	-Allen
