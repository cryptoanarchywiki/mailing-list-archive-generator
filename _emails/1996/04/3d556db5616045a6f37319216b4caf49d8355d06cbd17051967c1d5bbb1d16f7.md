I just noticed an attack vector that I wasn't aware of previously.  If the browser
is running with CLASSPATH set to include the JDK classes.zip applets are
suddenly able to enumerate all the system properties.
On my system user.name is set to '?', but user.dir and user.home are both
available.

This isn't a huge exposure, but it is unsettling.
