>On June 30th, 1996, a large anti-CDA rally, the Electronic Freedom March,
>is planned for the Ellipse, in front of the White House.  But without your
>help, it won't happen.
>
>We need volunteers to help us plan the EFM and the logistics required for
>it, people to help us raise funds to pay the expenses (the Park Service
>has required us to provide 80 porta-potties, at a cost of nearly $4500.00
>alone, and that's not our only requirement. . .), and people to help us
>run the March on June 30th.  Not to mention publicity, etc.
>
>We need your help.  **I** need your help.  I've posted this to the DC area
>groups, as well as to a few groups that I feel might be useful in
>gathering more volunteers and interested people.  But I need your
>committment to help NOW, or we won't be able to run the EFM, or as it's
>been called, the "Million Geek March".  Come on, out there: help us out!!!
