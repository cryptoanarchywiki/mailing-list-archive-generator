give me a break!!! the future government attempts to squelch, 
suppress, restrict, prohibit, regulate, tax, spindle, and 
mutilate Digital Cash will make Clipper look as significant and
threatening as a christmas tree ornament.

we have not seen the tiniest shred of the panic and paranoia
that will resonate through government once they get a clue about
what Digital Cash means to the future of the world.

furthermore, it is my belief that there are some very rich people
that effectively control our governments, who have strangleholds 
on various aspects of the world economy that will become a 
tad upset as well.

as I wrote in an earlier essay, the possibilities of combining 
digital cash with stock market company shares suggest a radical
new economy that would have the potential to topple a lot of 
very powerful existing interests, in the way that printing presses
once toppled the Church.

to borrow a bit of Chinese black humor, "we live in interesting times".
we will be living in even more interesting times shortly.
