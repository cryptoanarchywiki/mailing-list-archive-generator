That's _Nationalized_ Public Radio; any conspiracy that couldn't get
somebody on their denying that they were the secret power behind the 
government is obviously not competent to be the _real_ secret power
behind the government.  The interview just shows how pervasive they are. :-)

Meanwhile, Robert Ludlum's got a new book out, doing another
"hidden Nazis-will-rise-again" conspiracy.  It's ok, though not
as good as his best work.  Among other events, the disinformation
leaked out by the Neo-Nazis frames many prominent people as Nazis,
a critical few of whom really are.  And there's a bad parody of a
fat talk-show host somewhat to the right of Attila the Hun
(Caller: "Double whippo, Arnie!") who gets framed on the air...

Foo - even I've had contacts in the Sendero Luminoso, though they
all would have strictly denied it - they were just "good Socialist
college students" and "immigrant refugees" from Peru, which _does_ have
a fairly brutal and sleazy elected dictator.  Not everybody in the
anti-war business is pro-peace.

Sure, cause fiction's supposed to make sense.
