They can have all the records for the pamphlet remailer from the relevant
time periods - it doesn't keep any.  I may have to start some sort of
short-term log-keeping to deal with spam problems (for now, I've shut it down,
because of a particularly hostile kind of spam that would require grepping the
body of each outgoing message to stop, and I haven't written code for that.)
If I do start logging, I'll probably also insist that all incoming traffic 
be encrypted.  And there are certainly ECPA issues involved in a subpoena,
as well as major First-Amendment issues, reporter shield law issues (though
I gather those vary by state), and such.

        Good luck!
#					Thanks;  Bill
