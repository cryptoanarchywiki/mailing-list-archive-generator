 I suppose this thing could go on and on and on and be argued in many ways,
but I have to side with Tim here. I would add that America started out a
scant 300 or so years ago, we are what we are because we worked at it. If
we speak a language and most of the 200+ million Americans do, and we are
a dominant factor in the world today .... why should we learn another
language. I learned VietNamese when I went off to war. I learned Russian
for the hell of it after taking several courses in Russian history. I have
learned some French out of courtesy and survival when I go to Montreal (but
a 90 minute drive from here). If I were not going any of these places why
would I learn another language, why waste the time? Let me turn it around;
If I were in downtown Moscow what moral highground could justify that I
demand the locals speak English to me? By what right does anyone demand that 
the 70-80% of Americans who will never have a need for a second langauge
learn one?
