crypt(3) is a hash function, used for passwords and login, and is exportable.
crypt(1) is the rotor-based enigma-like encryption filter, and is not
exportable.
The Unix versions that support crypt(1) generally also have a -x option for
ed and vi to let you edit encrypted files.  Crypt Breaker's Workbench works
on it.

Actually, unless you specifically apply for permission, even rot13 isn't
exportable.
Unfortunately, this means it's illegal for me to make Rot13-Breaker's Workbench
available for ftp :-)
