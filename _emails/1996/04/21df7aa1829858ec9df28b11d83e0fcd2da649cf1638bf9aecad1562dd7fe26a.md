I'm seeing a few notes of this sort which make such claims, but there is not 
enough information included to establish that anybody _originally_ called 
those 9-bit data items "bytes" or not.  It appears to me that after the 
fact, 20+ years later, there is a tendency to call ANYTHING other than a 
single bit a byte, at least during that time frame.  What I'm looking for, 
however, is an indication that this was actually the term used, THEN, for 
that data structure.
