If you want to do string matching (search for an exact match on a string --
as opposed to checking whether a set of words is in a database) a good
choice would be the Boyer-Moore algorithm.  It has the nice property
that worst case it requires O(n) time (n = dictionary byte count) but
on average it is quite a lot better -- and furthermore, the longer the string
you're looking for, the faster it gets...
