Look, folks, we're seeing more and more of these "test" messages. With
1000+ subscribers, clearly people should not be using the list as a target
for test messages.

And there is no need. Unlike, say, mail-to-newsgroup systems, about which
there may be some doubt as to functioning, the Cypherpunks list is just
another mailing address. Thus, if you can send anonymous mail to
yourself--always a good test target--then you can send it to the
cypherpunks@toad.com!

I just deleted-and-ignored the last several of these "test" messages, but
the time has come to say "Enough."

(This is, naturally, not an enforceable opinion. I appeal to your common
sense to not use the list as a target for test messages.)
