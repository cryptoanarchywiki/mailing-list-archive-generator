There will be another physical meeting on the Cypherpunks in Portland, OR.

The particulars:

Location:   Powell's Technical Bookstore
            33 NW Park
            Portland, OR 97209
            (Just north of Burnside off of the Park blocks.)

Date:       April 27th, 1996
Time:       5:23pm

Discussions will cover:

** A Portland Remailer

** Various Coding Projects

** Events in the News

** Other Projects related to Crypto (Web sites and Documentation)

** Possible PGP Keysigning (Depends on the response)

** General Discussion Devolving into Chaos

If you have any other topics for discussion, bring them up at the meeting or 
you can e-mail me in advance.

Powell's Technical Book has a good selection of crypto books, so you might 
want to be prepared.  (Do not bring money you cannot afford to spend.  
Powell's has an evil force that seduces people into buying books.)

A PGP keysigning will be held if there are enough interested people.  If you 
are interested in participating, please send me your public key via e-mail.

Any comments, suggestions, ideas, and/or complains can be sent to me at
