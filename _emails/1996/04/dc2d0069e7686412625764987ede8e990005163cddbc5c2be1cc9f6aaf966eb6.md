  IMO, if you didn't remove the material from your archives, the Washington Post wouldn't be able to press the issue any further.
  Email posted to a listserv enters into and becomes the possession of the public domain.  If they ran a search looking for their material, then obviously credit was appropriately given to the quote.
  The Unabomber's Manifesto was posted on the Net.  Since the Post published it in its entirety, then they have a right to tell me to remove it if I had downloaded it?
  Personally, I think the letter is full of the stuff one would step into out on the range where the deer and the antelope play.
