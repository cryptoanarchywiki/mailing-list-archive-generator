The New York Times online site reports on a researcher at Oak Ridge National
Labs who "devised and patented a new mathematical system for encrypting and
authenticating digital data, based on the scientific concept of chaos."  The
article mention that people in industry were less than enthused about
adopting it.  Even the inventor says that it "isn't robust enough for
military applications."  It seems to use a chaotic system at both ends with
a symmetric key.  It almost sounds like the NYT covered it because chaos is
"cool", not because this development is significant.  Any insights?

The story is online at http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/0407chaos.html
