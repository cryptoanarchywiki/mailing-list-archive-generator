A straight MD5 probably isn't supported by any of them, but then again
MD5 is not necessarily going to help too much.  The sort of people
that need a web page to change their password aren't likely to
use overly complex passwords (mixed-case, scrambled-in numbers,
et al.)  So if a snoop can get the MD5, her chances of getting a password
aren't all that bad.

Your best bet is to try to implement it via SSL, but as I understand
it that limits you on your server options quite a bit.  Netscape and
Apache have it, as I understand; I think that's about it actually.
But that's far from my areas of expertise.
