This is just another great example of the Law of Unintended
Consequences.

One of the nice things about the Internet is that kids can
explore all sorts of subjects in the safety of their living room,
providing they follow a few simple rules about not giving out
personal information like their age, name, address, and phone
number, and don't arrange meetings or use information they obtain
without checking first with a well-clued caregiver.

An "age bit" definitely qualifies as the disclosure of "personal
information" about the user.

I think the "age bit" will solve a lot of problems we have now
with 50 year old wankers posing as 12 year olds on pedo IRC
channels. :)
