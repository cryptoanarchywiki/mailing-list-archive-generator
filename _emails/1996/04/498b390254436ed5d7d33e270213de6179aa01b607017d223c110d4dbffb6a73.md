Above, I merely asked a question that you still can't answer.  The fact that 
courts claim that there is a difference between "civil" and "criminal" does 
not mean that any such difference is constitutionally mandated, or for that 
matter even allowed.  Nothing in your response showed otherwise.


>(a) A criminal contempt fine is punitive and can be imposed only through
>criminal proceedings, including the right to jury trial. 

Does that mean that it would have been constitutionally impermissible to 
take the different position that ALL fines are ultimately "punitive"?  That 
position is apparently not _excluded_ by the constituion, which means that 
at best, you might try to argue that your position is _allowed_ by the 
constitution.  But since the Constitution is, indeed, the statement of the 
government's authority, not its limits, that would be a contradiction.  

The obvious conclusion is that your sentence above is simply unsupported by 
the Constitution, as are many of your statements below.  I'm not claiming 
that you are, necessarily, the source of the contradiction:  Obviously, most 
of it is simply governmental misbehavior that you are reporting.

>A contempt fine is

>considered civil and remedial if it either coerces a defendant into 
>compliance with a court order 

You do love those circular arguments, don't you!  Maybe it's pointless to 
ask you why anybody has to "comply with a court order."   I've already asked 
this before:  What, in the Constitution, gives judges authority over 
non-defendant citizens?

A paragraph which is delightfully free of constitutional justification.  It 
apparently merely parrots the decisions of courts, it doesn't explain them.  
Typical Unicorn behavior.

>Because civil contempt sanctions are viewed as nonpunitive and avoidable, 
>fewer procedural protections for such sanctions have been required.

Hmmm...  I wonder why? I mean, would it have been impossible for the SC to 
have declared that regardless of those assertions, ALL such sanctions 
require those "procedural protections."  Unicorn has no answer, as usual.
Hint:  If the position you support is true, then you should be able to show 
me evidence that no other alternative position is consistent with the 
Constitution.   As long as you cannot show that one PARTICULAR 
interpretation is uniquely supported,  you haven't supported this particular 
claim.

No constitutional justification, again.  Ho hum.


>The justification for the contempt charges are on the 
>proper administration of justice, to which every citizen is entitled. 

Unicorn fails to show that "Proper administration of justice" requires 
contempt charges.  And the most obvious problem with the "to which every 
citizen is entitled" argument is that it is vastly overbroad:  If it could 
be used in this instance, it could be used to justify beating confessions 
out of prisoners, shooting unarmed suspects, and practically every other act 
that somebody claimed was necessary for "the proper administration of justice."

After all, consider how "justice" was administered 300 years ago.  I'm sure 
those people did a lot of things, based on a claim that it was necessary for 
"the proper administration of justice."  Was it really?

What, BTW, is "proper"?

Is that a satisfactory justication for your position?

>
>Mr. Bell claims this is a new tyrranical development.  Mr. Bell is incorrect.

Where, EXACTLY, did I claim that it was a "new" development?  I've carefully 
re-read my statements, and I see nothing that states or even implies this.  
Continuing to knock down that straw man, huh?


>Ex parte Robinson, 86 U.S. 505, 19 Wall. 505, 510, 22 L. Ed. 205 (1874)

>(122 years ago).

In 1860, slavery was considered vital to the running of much of the US.  So?

[a couple other old decisions excised because they are irrelevant, and they 
are irrelevant because I didn't claim this was a "new" development."]

Which simply means that what a court thinks it "needs" is frequently wrong.  
If courts "needed" pressing, why do they no longer do it?  Hmmmmm?  
Apparently, it wasn't really necessary, and thus, any justifications based 
on the claim that it was necessary were dishonest.  As are your 
justifications today, on a somewhat different issue.

I've long pointed out that your own arguments self-destruct, and perhaps 
that was the most laughable example.

Generally in a non-slavery society, if you want people to do something for 
you, you hire them at a wage they will accept, and they'll happily do what 
you want.  It's called "capitalism."  Too bad courts still believe in slavery.

>Or appear before a court when summoned? 

Tell me, if _I_ "summon" somebody, do they have to show as well?  If not, 
why should a "court" have any such authority.

> Or testify if its inconvenient? 

If it's testimony in favor of the prosecution, and I don't want to give that 
testimony, I see no constitutional justification for forcing me to do so.

You'll probably try to claim that this testimony is "necessary."  Let's 
suppose I was out of the country and was unavailable for 
subpoena.  The trial would go on, anyway, so obviously my testimony was not 
"necessary" by any logical definition.  It was merely desirable, by 
somebody's opinion.  Sure, the prosecution may lose the case, but the 
prosecution doesn't have a "right" to win the trial, now does it?  At best, 
it only has the "right" (arguably; but even that "right" is conditional) to 
have a trial.  The outcome is not guaranteed!

I said it was "bizarre."  I did not say it was "uncommon."

BTW, note that "late filing fees" assumes that somebody is obligated to file 
something, and likewise "Administrative fines" assumes that somebody is 
entitled to levy them, etc.  We won't get into taxes, that would take FAR 
too long.

But they apparently don't have to be.  Arbitration is an option.

I notice that you failed to address the point.  You're unable to find any 
Constitutional justification for compelling prosecution testimony.  There is

exists.

I am well aware of the misbehavior of government.  The issue is 
constitutional justifications for it.  They seem to be, well, practically 
nonexistent.

I'm working on it.  But you won't like the outcome; there will be no 
"kings", either stated or implied, in the system I am crafting.  No 
centralizations of power at all.  It will be a system you can't understand.

That's spelled "precedent."  But why am I telling you this?
