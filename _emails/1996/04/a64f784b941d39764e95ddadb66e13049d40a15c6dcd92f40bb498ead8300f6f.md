The question is if they are truly random bombings and how do we determine if
they are.  And if they are truly random, how can they be adapted as a source

We had to let a few more bombs go off.")

How many bits of entropy do you get from an explosion anyways?  (Depends on
how close you are to the blast...) ];>
