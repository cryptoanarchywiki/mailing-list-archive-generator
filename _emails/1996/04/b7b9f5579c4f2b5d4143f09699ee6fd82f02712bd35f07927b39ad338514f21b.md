I have had my ViaCrypt PGP version 4.0 for windows for 1 week.

It is *supposed* to be interoperable with all PGP versions 2.6 and later.

>Furthermore, has anyone tried the new version?

I have used it, but so far have not been able to communicate with anyone
that is using PGP 2.6.2.  I have communicated with ViaCrypt and they are
researching the problem.  Yes, I used the option that is supposed to make
the key interoperable with PGP 2.6.2.  I followed the instructions in the book
and the security note.  Even did it again (generated a new key) just to make
sure I did it correctly, still no go!  

I will not blame ViaCrypt until I know if it is my fault or not!

BTW, I'm using the Business Edition.
