Only Teller's/Cashier's and Traveler's Checks. These represent the
conversion of Cash into a promise to pay when the Check is presented. This
is the same as dcash. An Uncashed Personal Check (unless it has been
certified [which withdraws the money from the account at Certification
time]) only represents an unsecured claim on the monies in the account (ie:
the Bank has no knowledge of its existence or amount until it is presented
for payment/clearance).
