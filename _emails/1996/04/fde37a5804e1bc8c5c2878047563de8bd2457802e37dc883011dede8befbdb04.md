Some more than others, huh?  B^)

FWIW, I think that there is no capital-gains-type tax on currency 
conversions.  In other words, if I take dollars and buy yen today, and the 
interconvert rate changes and I convert back and make a "profit," that is 
not considered income.  If that's the case, then ecash has an excellent 
precedent behind it to avoid any taxes on interest, especially if that 
interest is, in effect, paid by increasing the inherent value of the currency.

And most of the "interest" will simply be the avoided inflation loss that 
would have otherwise occurred.  Buying ecash may be equivalent to buying an 
absolutely non-inflating currency that the government can't manipulate.
