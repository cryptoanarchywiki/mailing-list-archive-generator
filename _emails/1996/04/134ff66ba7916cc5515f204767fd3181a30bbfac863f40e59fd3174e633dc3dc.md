You're giving a definition straight from a dictionary--an old one. Welcome to the modern world.

On the contrary. The Federal Reserve holds Government securities corresponding to the dollar value of currency in circulation. It earns interest income on this amount, and returns this income to the Treasury. This is called seigniorage. It amounts this year to something over $20 billion.

This is a very real issue. To the extent that electronic money replaces currency (reduces the amount in circulation), it will cost the Treasury seigniorage--and the Government is acutely aware of this. Whether the beneficiaries are consumers, banks, or other issuers of digital cash will depend on the system.
