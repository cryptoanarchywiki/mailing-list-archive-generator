I will be in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas briefly at the end of
April. Anyone who would like to trade keysignatures, please email me. 
(Unfortunately my ability to get around will be somewhat limited)

ObCypherpunks: I read cpunks by NNTP from nntp.hks.net. Let me assure you, the
apparent noise level has gone down by 90% from when it landed in my mailbox.
Many thanks to those who provide this service.
