	The solution is to store your keys on an encrypted filesystem,
such as Cryptdisk or CFS.  Thus, possession of the keyrings does no
good, because they're encrypted.  I've found that leaving PGP on the
encrypted partition makes me less likely to get error messages like
'keyring unavailable,' and I do get the obvious: pgp: Command not
found

| Fortunately, the snoop would not be able to use the key, since it would be
