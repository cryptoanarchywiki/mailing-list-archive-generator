Come on, give it up already and admit you were wrong. At least 8 different
people have cited examples of machines that supported non 8bit bytes. Your
pride is getting the best of you.

If you mean 8 bits, you should really say Octets as has always been the
form of Internet RFC's where the distinction is important.

It may be standard today, but it was not always so..
