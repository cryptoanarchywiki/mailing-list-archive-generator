Java applications _can_ save files to disk, and read them.

Further, even the presently-more-constrained applets can retrieve certain
types of files. For example, "getImage" and "getAudioClip" methods.

I mention this point for two reasons.

First, it says the applet model is not forever and totally blocked from
reading disk files. (And I would not be surprised to see additional file
retrieval methods "allowed." To be sure, this raises more and more security
issues to look at, but TANSTAAFL.)

Second, the relevance for providing sources of entropy for Java applets. I
haven't looked in detail, but I'll be willing to bet quite a bit that
someone has already or soon will run a QuickCam video input, not to mention
sound input, in a Java applet, and that this could easily be used as a
source of entropy bits.
