I tried sending a test message to the address indicated, and received it back
a day later, so sending email to this address does reach me.  The funny part
is that I have never (to my knowledge) had any communication with
anon.penet.fi prior to receiving this email.  

Questions:
1. How do I use this to SEND messages anonymously?  Having an email address
with no obvious link to my identity is cool, but I would like to be able to
send as well as receive.  I sent email to help@anon.penet.fi, but have
received no response yet.

2. Why was I chosen for this?  How did anon.penet.fi find out my email
address?  Is the NSA trying to lull me into a false sense of security in the
hope that I will use this account to violate ITAR?

3. Has anyone else on this list received unsolicited remailer accounts?
