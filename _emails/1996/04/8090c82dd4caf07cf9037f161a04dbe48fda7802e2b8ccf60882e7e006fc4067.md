Actually, this is not true.  The poster, from rumors I have heard, was
someone else with a Caltech alumni account (I don't know who).  I have
never been contacted by any representatives of Scientology with respect
to this case.  So it is apparently just a coincidence that this case
involved the same system as my remailer.
