         LAS VEGAS, Nevada, April 1 (Reuter) - The overwhelming  
majority of America's top corporate high tech users will have 
implemented some Internet strategy over the next 12 months, 
although worries over security and distracted workers persist. 
         A survey of 500 leading U.S. networking users found that 89  
percent expect to have implemented strategies for using Internet 
technologies in internal corporate networks -- known as 
intranets -- by the end of the next 12 months. 
         But 70 percent believe employees use the Internet for  
entertainment on company time and 54 percent are worried about 
the security of information they exchange over the Internet. 
         A preview of the Network World 500 Internet study  
"Networking in the Cyber Age," jointly conducted by Network 
World and International Data Corp, was due to be released here 
on Tuesday at the NetWorld+Interop trade show. 
         A significant portion of respondents -- 28 percent --  
already make some use of Internet or intranet applications for 
making transactions in electronic commerce with customers, while 
48 percent plan to do so in the next 12 months. 
         "As networking enters the cyber age, it will create new  
electronic commerce oppertunities on the Internet, increasing 
general acceptance and demand," Network World president and 
chief executive Colin Ungaro said in a statement. 
         Among the top five general Internet trends, 83 percent of  
respondents said they use the Internet for communications -- 
email and file sharing, while 78 percent said they use it for 
research, such as accessing electronic information. 
         A majority of 55 percent said they access the Internet  
several times a day, and that most spend five to 30 minutes per 
session on-line using the global computer network. 
         An overwhelming majority of 85 percent of respondents said  
they have Web servers in their organizations for Internet 
applications, and 73 percent for intranet use -- while 88 
percent said new services will make public carriers more 
important to their company's enterprise network strategies. 
         Fully 69 percent said they have remote access to local area  
networks for more than 200 employees. 
         "The study demonstrates how quickly corporate America has  
become acclimated to Internet technologies," said John Gallant, 
editor-in-chief of Network World. 
         The annual telephone survey polled 500 U.S. network users  
whose companies have internetworked local area networks and wide 
area networks and annual network expenditures of more than $5 
million, with more than 1,000 employees.
