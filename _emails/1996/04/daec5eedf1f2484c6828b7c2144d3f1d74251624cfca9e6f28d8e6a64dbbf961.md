Personally, I recommend the Syquest EZdrive over tape.  The EZ is a fully
functional (bootable, too) 130 MB hard drive ($200 for an IDE internal model,
also available in SCSI and parallel port versions)  that uses removable
cartridges ($20 each) for storage.  Most backup programs let you back up to a
hard drive, which is much faster than tape, and more reliable as well.  Ditto
the bit about storing the backups (whatever media) somewhere the CO$ will
never find them, and keeping your mouth shut about it.
