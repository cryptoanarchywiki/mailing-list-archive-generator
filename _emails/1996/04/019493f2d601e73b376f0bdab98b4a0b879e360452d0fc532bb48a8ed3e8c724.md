I think you're right.  There is no need for the issuer to pay explicit
interest.  The easiest way to eliminate signorage would be to steadily
increase the value of each denomination of ecash.  It would be kind of
like a mutual fund that doesn't pay dividends.  In fact, if the ecash is
backed by a portfolio of investment securities and its value floats with
the value of the portfolio, then it would be almost exactly like a mutual
fund.

Of course, as Jonathan Wienke pointed out, the IRS would not be very happy
about this.  Then again, the IRS would not be happy with a lot of the
technology discussed on this list.
