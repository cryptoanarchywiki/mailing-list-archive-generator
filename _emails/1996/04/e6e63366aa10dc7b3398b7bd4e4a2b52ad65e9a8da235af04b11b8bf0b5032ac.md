No.  Shabbir claims just what he said, AFAIK, that "no reasonable person is
objecting..."  A very different matter.  What I believe and what I choose to
object to through organized political initiatives may be two different things.

If Shabbir's wording is so critical, why did you change it by adding "believes?"

I don't believe government should be able to wiretap it's citizens, but I
also don't think there's a snowball's chance in hell of taking that power away
from the FBI.  That's why I want strong crypto.  There is a far greater chance
of getting some decent crypto legislation enacted than of completely removing
the FBI's authority to wiretap.  It's a much more "reasonable" goal, in that
sense.

There are people much more deserving of cypherpunk scorn than someone who
works as hard on these issues as Shabbir.  It's pretty pathetic, Jim.
