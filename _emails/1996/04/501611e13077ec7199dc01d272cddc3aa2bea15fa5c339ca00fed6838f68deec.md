The sequence number is not a sequence number, nor is 
it just any random number.  It is a random number of 
some special form, so that the chance that the "other money" 
will be of this special form is remote.  For example one 
might demand that every second hex digit was the number 7, 
and the other digits were random.  When we divide a valid 
money number by r, we will not get another valid money number.
