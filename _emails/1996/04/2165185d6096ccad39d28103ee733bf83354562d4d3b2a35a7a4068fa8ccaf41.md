Subject: E-Commerce Info. Needed
Status: U

Dear sir,

I'm doing a project on Security and E-Commerce. I would like to know if you
could help me on my search of information on two subjects:

* Graphics and statistics about the growth of the e-commerce in the last
years, and also on the attacks to comercial sites on this period.

* Future tendencies, projects... on e-commerce, and how security is going
to affect the future on the commercial sites.

When I say 'information' I'm talking about URL's (of course)

Thanks a lot, and please forgive my bad use of English!
