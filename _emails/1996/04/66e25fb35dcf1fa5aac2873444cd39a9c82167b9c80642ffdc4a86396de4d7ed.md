I thought that most or all of the cypherpunk anonymous remailers don't
keep records.  Not even on backup tapes.  The whole idea is that there
aren't logs.  But maybe they have found some remailers that are
non-cypherpunk.  And I haven't verified the truth of what's in the msg
below.  If anyone hears anything, please let me (or eff@eff.org) know.

Seems like it's just a tad overbroad, if true.  Another example of, "all
the 'justice' that one can buy"?
