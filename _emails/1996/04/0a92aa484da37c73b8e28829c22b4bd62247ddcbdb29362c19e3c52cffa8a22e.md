[I've done my best to make this somewhat relevant, and to ignore most of
the obvious trolls.]

We don't. Not that the "volunteer snitches" are anywhere near as important
ans they think they are. Most LEO types will just blow them off, because
there isn't probable cause. Where the private orgs come into play is
*after* some wacko goes postal, and the government wants expert witnesses.

This raises some interesting questions about the power of private data
collection and data havens, though. There is something to be said for the
rule of law. At least the government is somewhat accountable, and will
always be "infiltrated" by professional bureaucrats who care about human
rights. Private organizations are more ideologically coherent and less
likely to open their affairs to public scrutiny.

The more I get into this, the more backwards this sounds. As a FUCKING
STATIST, I'm a lot more comfortable with certain racists than with
anti-government zealots of any political persuasion. This assumes, of
course, that the racists lack sufficient power to put their genocidal
ideas into practice.

"Undercover operatives" is much too maudlin. I went under my own name,
said hello to a few folks. Weaver is a fucking lunatic, but the skiing
was good.

This is news to me. What's your source for this?

50 years ago, American citizens of Japanese descent were just being let
out of "internment camps," and the State of Mississippi was keeping files
on 87,000 "political subversives" -- never mind the FBI. I'm not a big fan
of the bad, old days.

30 and 76 years ago, many parts were bombed. Berkeley. Ronald Reagan.
Sacco & Vanzetti. Eugene Debs. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. Forget
everything you've ever been told about "right" and "left"; it's the same
people, really, fighting for the same things, mostly.

You're joking, right?

To learn what the Church of Scientology is really about, see
http://www.theta.com/

To learn what Watergate was really about, visit the Nixon Presidential
Library.

To learn what the IRA is really about, talk to Gerry Adams.

To learn what the Cuban Revolution is really about, talk to Castro or your
local "Pastors for Peace" propagandist.

No, the only way to learn about an organization is to JOIN IT. You should
see the mail I'm getting now.

Don't worry, Newt is working on it.
