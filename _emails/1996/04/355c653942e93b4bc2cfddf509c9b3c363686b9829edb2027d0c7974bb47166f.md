	But you're presupposing a public key distribution mechanism
such that the list software can get a key for that user.  And that
that's a valid key for that user, not a key that J Random kRak3r didn't
just send in for his clueless AOL victim before said victim established
a public key.

	At any rate, has something like this been put into the current
PGPdomo?  I don't think that it would be too hard to hack in a query
to a web keyserver to grab a key.  If the initial request's not
signed, maybe include a note about how to go about getting PGP and
putting a key on the keyserver (or a pointer to instructions on the
web).
