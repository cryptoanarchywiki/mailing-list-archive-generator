I find that to be a disgusting opinion.  Quite to the contrary, I think that 
whenever it _appears_ that giving up "a little liberty" would provide more 
security, there are other ways of providing that same security that don't 
require any loss of liberty.

For just one example, it is well known that the "war on drugs" actually 
causes a great deal of street crime.  But a person who doesn't see this, or 
doesn't want to admit this might see that crime and conclude that some loss 
of liberty (like, for instance, giving the police the authority to stop and 
frisk all passers-by whenever they want) would improve safety.  What he 
doesn't admit is that by legalizing drugs nearly all of that crime would 
disappear, vastly improving safety.

So it's a false trade-off, in both directions.  Authoritarians may disagree.
