Remind me not to use this junk. Ever. 

In the USA we still have a right to privacy. I don't give a damn about
the "needs of law enforcement" simply becasue the perception of their
needs has grown beyond the reality of what they actualy "need". If left
up to many of the worlds LEO's, there would be taps on all phones and
cameras on every corner. Their jobs would be easy, and that's what
they want.

The desires of law enforcment organizations are fundementaly at odds
with a free populace and the actualization of liberty in the practice
of law. Software like what has been described above serves only as
an example of that in my mind.
