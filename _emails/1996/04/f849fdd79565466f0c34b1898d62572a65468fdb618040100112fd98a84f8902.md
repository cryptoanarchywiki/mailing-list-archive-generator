	It seems that Moody has gotten greedy, and is asking for money
for unsolicited services, with a carefully worded non-threat.

	To my mind, unsolicited work is just that.  Its something many
of us do from time to time, with no expectation of being paid.
Usually we don't spend months on a project that won't be satisfying
without a contract.

	To do work and then bill for it without a handshake strikes me
as bogus.  I wouldn't do it myself, and I have no respect for Moody's,
who seems to be doing it.

	I trust Morningstar more because they bill me for the
information they give me.  They have no relationship with the
evaluated.  A much better model.
