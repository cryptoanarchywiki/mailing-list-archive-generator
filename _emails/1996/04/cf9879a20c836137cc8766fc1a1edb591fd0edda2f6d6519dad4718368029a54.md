Isn't it a bit difficult to subpeona an anonymous remailer?  

If run on a large enough system, a remailer can be shut down but not siezed.
(I can imagine the marshalls hauling off the Cal Tech mainframes.)

If a remailer operator has an accomodation address and/or a false name
effective service of process also becomes difficult.  

Usually in life I've noticed that if you just ignore stuff it goes away.
Occaisionally you will be hassled but if you ignore many of the orders of
others for your whole life, you will find that your net amount of what we
might call "autonomous activity" will be greater than if you slavishly obey
every order.
