Funny, this looks an awful lot like a query (with an apparently real name
attached) which appeared in www-security last week from Malaysia.

I'm aware of the following servers, available outside the US, which 
claim to offer 128 bit SSL encryption:

 free, commercial support available.
 supports client authentication
 Available from British sites

Sioux
 Unix (solaris)
 see ftp://ftp.inect.co.za/pub/products/sioux/ANNOUNCE
 support client authentication
 Based on Apache
 2500 Rand

Alibaba
 NT/Win95

COSMOS

 WebCompare claims this has SSL2, but I can't find a mention of their
 Website. US $2000 and up. Available from France.

For a survey of web servers, I strongly recommend WebCompare:
