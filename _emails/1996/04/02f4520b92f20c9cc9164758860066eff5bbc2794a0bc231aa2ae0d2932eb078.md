All you have to do is call up CoS's lawyers. Let your fingers do the 
walking...

Seriously though, might it not be nicer (easier?) to establish some court
precedents on remailers vs. CoS rather than the government? Think of it as
a preemptive strike. The argument of CoS's religious copyright and trade
secrets don't seem to me be as emotionally effective horsemen as "National
Security Threats" or "Child Pornography". I really wouldn't want to see
Congress get away with legislating on remailers in a legal vacuum. 

Go for it Sameer. ;-) (Hope you won't be needing Jim's ISP-Aspol inc. 
insurance against them pesky scientologists...[double ;-) ])
