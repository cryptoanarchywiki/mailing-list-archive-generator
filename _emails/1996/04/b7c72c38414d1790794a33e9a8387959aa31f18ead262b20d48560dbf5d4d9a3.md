The above is very confusing and stems, IMHO, from imprecise use of terms.
It is important to distinguish between 4 types of remailers: 

* traceable pseudonymous
* untraceable pseudonymous
* traceable anonymous
* untraceable anonymous

The text quoted above is true if it describes a "traceable pseudonymous" 
remailer, e.g.  anon.penet.fi.  This is different from, say, a cypherpunks
style remailer. 

For a full, perhaps tedious, explication of all this and other stuff too, see

http://www.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/ocean1-7.htm

an earlier, much shorter, and slightly dated, treatement of the anonymity 
issues only can be found at http://www.law.cornell.edu/jol/froomkin.htm
