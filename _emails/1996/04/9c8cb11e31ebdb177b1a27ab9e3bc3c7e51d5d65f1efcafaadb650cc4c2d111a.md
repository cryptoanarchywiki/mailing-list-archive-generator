	In regards to these timestamping devices... how do they know the
correct time? It looks like that would be distortable, and with that, you could
simply simulate the satellites to them via placing the device inside a metal
box and piping in the appropriately modified signals. If it's getting its time
information from the signals themselves, things get even easier.
