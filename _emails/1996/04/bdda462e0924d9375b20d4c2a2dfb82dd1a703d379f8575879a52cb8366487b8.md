This is a hard thing to do in U.S. courts just because of the way the 
history and jurisprudence of the U.S. legal system works.  That is, the 
neutral finder of fact does not typically participate in investigations

through the clash of their respective interests before him/her.

Many jurisdictions allow an active judiciary in this regard.  Its nearly 
improper in the U.S.
