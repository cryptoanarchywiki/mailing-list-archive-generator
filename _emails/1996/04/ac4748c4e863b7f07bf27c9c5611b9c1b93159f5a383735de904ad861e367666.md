This assumes that the purpose of the ITAR restrictions is to keep a secret.
To the extent that the gov't argues that, they have no case as you point
out.

However, the ITAR is there specifically to frustrate US businesses if they
should want to sell or give away crypto overseas.  The rules, despite their
illogic, achieve that goal.

I would like to believe that the Supremes would rule that the Gov't has no
right to use what amounts to a secrecy provision just for harrassment --
but they might not.

I had Mike Nelson say to my face, 1.5 years ago, that he knows good crypto
is available to foreigners -- he just wants to make damn sure it doesn't
come in shrink-wrapped packages from US companies.  I can't judge the
constitutionality of that position but it holds together logically.
