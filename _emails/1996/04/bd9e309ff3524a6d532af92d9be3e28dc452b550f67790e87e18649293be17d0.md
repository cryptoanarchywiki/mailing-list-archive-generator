There is one thing about the proposed minor flag addition to IP that I
don't understand. [No, I am not surprised by this. Mandatory authorization
to establish a connection and an "Internet Driver License", probably in the
form or a smart card are coming].

If my computer creates the IP packet, what is there to prevent me from
modifying the value of the "Minor/Adult" flag at my leisure?
