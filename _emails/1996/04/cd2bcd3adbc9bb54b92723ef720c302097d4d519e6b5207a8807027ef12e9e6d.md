There are some limits to the extent of this kind of problem.  If the
hardware/OS you are using provides a completely disjoint memory map based
on the privileged mode state, it may be hard to exploit the ability to
switch to privileged mode.  With maps which allow access to the user's
address space while in privileged mode (e.g. Solaris), it may be possible
to just keep running, and so complete a successful attack.

On the other hand, with most systems I have seen, setting yourself into
privileged state will persist thru the next interrupt.  The system Norm and
I worked on would detect it later.  (It checked every 5 minutes or so.) 
The IBM operating systems I have used would not detect, or correct this
change.

The ray  of hope in this area is that there are so many other easier
attacks on modern systems.  People will have a tendency to use them first.
