This is a very good reason to use one of the "alpha" pseudonym servers.
These remailers in turn use other remailers to return the reply to
the owner of the alias (crypted, of course).  In this way, the server
is operating in double-blind mode.

However, the scariest thing about this is that the CoS was able to coerce
the gov't in a foreign nation to get access to anon remailers.  US
remailers have always been suspect for just this reason, and I wait
with bated breath to see whether or not the subpoena is issued.  But if
chaning outside the US won't even work, then the remailers aren't going
to do a whole lot of good.

I've heard several people make this statement...  Can anyone confirm that
it is really possible to log the uid (username) of the person making the
http request?  I know they can get your ip address, but I'm skeptical
of getting the username.
