Someone suggested that certain people were being signed up on Cypherpunks
as part of a two-fold spam attack:

1.) in order to flood victim's mailbox with Cypherpunks' Welcome messages,
    and list postings,

2.) to re-direct victim's ire at the Cypherpunks list,

thereby killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

Hence, the "Death Penalty" may be jumping the gun, so to speak.  ;)

Not sure how one would go about looking into this, though.
