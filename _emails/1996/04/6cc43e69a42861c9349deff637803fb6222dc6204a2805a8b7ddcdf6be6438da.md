By the same token, if an admin runs crack on /etc/passwd to weed out poor
passwords isn't going to be faulted for reducing the key space for user's
passwords. The question is, how much of the keyspace should be eliminated
as "obviously a poor choice"?

Also, how much of this falls under "security through obscurity"?  If an
attacker knows what you omit .. his/her job is a bit easier.

Is it possible to find a percentage of the key space to eliminate that
will optimize security assuming that the attacker will try the easy
stuff first (and is it possible to quantify "easy stuff")?
