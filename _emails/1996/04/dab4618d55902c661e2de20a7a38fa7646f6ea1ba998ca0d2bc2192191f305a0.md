	Courts have yet to rule that an individual can be forced
	to provide a sample of their handwriting, if the purpose
	of obtaining such a script is for a graphological profile.
	More to the point, courts -- or at least US Courts -- don't
	accept graphological profiles, as proof of anything.  

	I suspect you confusing graphology with questioned document
	examination. Courts have ruled that a person may be forced
	to provide a sample of writing, for use in questioned document
	examination, without violating the fifth amendment.  << You ought
	to read the case law, to see why providing such a sample is
	not a fifth amendment violation ---- it might help you be a 
	better armchair lawyer, who spends to much time watching
	Perry Mason reruns.  >> 

> Anyone who denies this should be required to make a list of the kinds of 

	Questined Document Examination, which you alluded to, was
	first accepted by courts in the United States, at the turn 
	of the century.  And it was only after World War One, that 
	it was accepted in all courts in the US.
