	It would make it kind of difficult to argue that 40-bit encryption
was anything near the required level, yes. Of course, I'd advise setting it
up _outside_ the US or any other country with a habit of disliking
cryptography - otherwise they'd just find some excuse or another to shut it
down. For instance, you'd probably have to set it up if it were in the US to
check where a request was from, in order to not violate some arcane ITAR rule
or another.
