But there has been an easy defense against such for decades. 

You run ordinary phone wire from the transmitter + antenna X meters
back to the bunker or whatever. Then you talk from there.

X varies as afunction of the expected incoming.

I bought some surplus 1950's era field telephones with this
option built it -- they had a 150v B-battery [NOW i'm dating myself]
that was dropped across the pair when you squeezed the handset
Push-to-Talk. At the far end, a relay closed & turned on the
transmitter.
