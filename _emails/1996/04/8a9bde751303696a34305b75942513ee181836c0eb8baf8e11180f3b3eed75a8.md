Notice that Stewart Baker didn't include as one of those groups, "The 
public."  In a typical Freudian slip, he reveals that the interests of the 
public don't seem to count for much, according to government-types like he 
used to be.

Why is it that I suspect that there are no greater "constitutional 
restraints" on wiretapping in Japan; just more concern to maintaining 
constitutional behavior?

More distortions.  Baker tries to imply that the decision on what is 
exportable bears no relationship to what is considered sufficient, whereas 
in fact we know that export approval practically requires an insecure system.

He continues to ignore public interest...  And lest he try to imply that 
government represents that "public interest," I should hasten to add 
"individual interest."

I would hardly characterize the US's policy towards encryption as "laissez 
faire."  The moment the patents on public-key encryption were granted, that 
presented a substantial impediment towards the use of that system by the 
public.  That ain't "laissez faire"!  The act of proposing Clipper was 
intended to deter competing systems of unescrowed encryption.  That ain't 
"laissez fair."

A "more accessible encryption standard"?   War is peace.  Freedom is 
slavery.  Plaintext is encrypted.

"Little law enforcement reason"???  Uh, pardon me, but could you mention 
what that little reason is?

What Baker forgot to say is that there may be an equally strong antipathy to 
wiretaps among Americans, according to polls I've heard of. The difference 
is, the people aren't getting their way WRT wiretaps.   And the Clipper 
proposal was DOA here, as well.
