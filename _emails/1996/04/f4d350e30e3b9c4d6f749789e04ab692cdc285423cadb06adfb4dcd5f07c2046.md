Yes, the scripts are freely available. The robomoderator has been
working for about three weeks and now I seem to have little problems
supporting it. Our human moderators spend relatively little time because
the majority of posts come from preapproved users, and approval and 
rejection commands are very easy to use.

The thing uses PGP extensively for authentification and secure exchange 
with human moderators. For signing approved articles it uses PMApp 
by Greg Rose.

There are still a couple of optional things to do (such as taking headers 
from PGP-signed parts of messages if they are there), but otherwise it is 
in working condition.

One really important thing to do before handing it out is adding more
comments...
