Or access the congressional record on thomas, as Rich gives earlier gives
us a URL to.  Go to http://thomas.loc.gov/r104/r104s17ap6.html, choose the
second TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT link, choose the first
BIDEN link.

Congress is putting information on how to build babyfood bombs on the
internet!   Clearly, the first thing the FBI would do under the law Biden
wants is wiretap congress to see who is accessing the congressional record.
Wonder what the congressional librarians who run thomas think of that.
