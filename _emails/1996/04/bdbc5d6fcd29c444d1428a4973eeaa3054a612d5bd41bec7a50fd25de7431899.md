This is a classic defeatist attitude, the one that Unicorn specializes in.  
He wants us to believe that there is literally NOTHING that anyone can 
possibly do to solve the "government problem."

I contend that had he talked to Phillip Zimmermann in 1990 or so, he would 
have told Zimmermann that "It's illegal to write an encryption program using 
RSA, because it's patented!  You'll never get away with it!"

But history records that Zimmermann _did_, and he "got away with it."

What I'm advocating is that people do what Zimmermann did: Write programs 
that will extend the usages of encryption to thwart attempts to retrieve 
data by its owners, whether or not the data is on the owner's system.

Notice that Unicorn never gives useful specific suggestions about which 
"legal means are available."

Cumulatively, they could do exactly this.  Spread among most ISP's, the cost 
per ISP could be quite low.  Augmented with my AsPol idea, the costs would 
be even lower.  What was that quote?  "A box of shells is cheaper than an 
appeal."
