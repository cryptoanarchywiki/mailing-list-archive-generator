     I never said I approved of separatism; I just consider it slightly less
evil than racism. It's sort of like the distinction between Chinese censorship
of the Net and American (attempted) censorship of the net - both are evil, the
American one is just less so because it doesn't go as far. The distinction
between racism and separatism isn't as great, admittedly.
