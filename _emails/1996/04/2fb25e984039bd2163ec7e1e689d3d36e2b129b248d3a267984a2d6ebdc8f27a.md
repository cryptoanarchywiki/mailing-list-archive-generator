	Applets (let alone javascript) should have no way to exist
once you kill the Netscape that is running the Java interpreter.  It
is possible for applets to keep running in their own thread even after
you've left the page they're loaded from, but once you kill the
browser the VM should get shut down (the whole browser, not just a
particular window).  I can't think of any way that an applet could
keep going once the VM stops.

	As for the original dialog thing, couldn't you C-A-Del it
to get the task window up and then shutdown the offending NS task?
