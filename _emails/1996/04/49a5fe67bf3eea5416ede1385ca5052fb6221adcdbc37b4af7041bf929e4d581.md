  I don't think that either the book or the t-shirt qualify for the expedited
review.  My brief skimming of John Gilmore's CJR site a few months ago left
me with the impression that only mass market commercial software that fit
within the SPA/govt deal (40-bit RC2 or RC4 with RSA keys <= 512-bits) was
eligible to be expedited.
