I left the word "you" out of one sentence.  My line breaks are very 
strange.  I wrote "chronologist" when I meant "horologist".  I revealed 
a US-centric point of view, and I broke a New Year's resolution by 
contributing to the noise level on the cypherpunks mailing list.  

But I did not forget to say:

>...every bit is uncorrelated with anything else in the universe ...

It's not really fair to call me crazy, just because 
one of my personalities is paranoid/schizophrenic.
