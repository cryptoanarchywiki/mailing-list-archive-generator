Does anyone, especially in Canada, ever noticed that them or their local net 
friends had their snail mail opened?

A friend of mine has his regularly opened; he complained to Canada Post
three times, but it stills goes on AFAIK.  He is pissed off at me, convinced
that the forwarding of Jim Bell's AP related articles is what justified the
mail opening.  Actually, he does not even reply to my e-mails anymore.  
We used to be great friends...


Neither of us ever engaged in any subversive activities or are involved in
illegal actions.

It seems that FUD got him.  ...sigh...

He even refused to *touch* PGP.  He is a professionnal programmer, in C++, win,

and OS-2.  Can you believe it?!?

Any comments?
