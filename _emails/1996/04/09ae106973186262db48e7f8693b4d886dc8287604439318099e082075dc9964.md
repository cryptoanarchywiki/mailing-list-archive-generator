By NSA standards, it is simple.  NSA has probably had its own semiconductor 
fabs for 30+ years.  Even if we assume that their capabilities lag 
commercial production in terms of density or quality, keyboard encoder chips 
were trivial 20+ years ago and could presumably be easily 
duplicated/modified today by even the oldest operating fabs.  They probably 
had far less than 10,000 transistors.  Even modern keyboard controllers 
probably "waste"  a microcontroller with far more capability than you'd need 
for the task, and microcontrollers usually have substantially more code area 
than would be necessary to add some sort of surreptitious function.

You'd have to know what to look for.


>Gets what they want, unclear.

If there was one single data stream you'd like to get, it's the keyboard.  
This doesn't get you everything, but close.
