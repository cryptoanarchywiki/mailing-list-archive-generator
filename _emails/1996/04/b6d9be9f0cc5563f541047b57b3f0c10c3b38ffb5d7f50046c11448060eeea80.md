This mechanism was tried extensively on the extropians list, and
in my judgement it was totally unsuccessful.

When money is at stake, flames concerning ill considered factual 
claims are replaced by power moves to manipulate the system,
obtain corrupt adjudicators, and intimidate, exclude and silence 
dispute in order to win, or conceal evasion of, ill considered bets.

This would work at $100.  But the temptation is always
to escalate the bet, to win by bluffing, with the result that
the dispute is escalated, rather than resolved.

At $500, our problem would become much worse, rather than much
better.
