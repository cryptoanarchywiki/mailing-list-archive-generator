No. Check this out. Very scary stuff. These people are too wierd:

Send e-mail addressed to listproc@internex.net with "Dilbert" as the 
subject and the words
"subscribe Dilbert_List Joe Blow" in the body of the message (be sure to 
replace the words
"Joe Blow" with your name!). Don't include any other information (your 
e-mail address will be picked up
automatically). NOTE: To unsubscribe, follow these same steps but use 
"unsubscribe
Dilbert_List" in the body of the message.

dastardly creatures can be found at PacBell.
