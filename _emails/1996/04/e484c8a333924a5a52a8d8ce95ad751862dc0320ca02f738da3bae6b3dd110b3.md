"IRS Worker Took Peek at Celebrities' Records"
[Associated Press]
  Memphis - A former IRS employee who said boredom had led him to peek at
the tax records of President Clinton, Elvis Presley and other famous people
has been acquitted of federal charges.
  Robert Patterson, 38, said it wasn't malicious - he was just trying to
learn how to better use the Internal Revenue Service computers.
  "I was sitting there bored, so I started punching up names," said Patterson.

Hmmm. _We_ do it, it's "malicious cracking/hacking" and they toss us in the
clink... _they_ do it, and it's "practice" (and they get acquitted). And
_these_ are the people who want to escrow _my_ keys? As IF!

Not only that, but also if the guy's so damn _bored_, why doesn't he spend
some time FIXING the damn computer systems at IRS (see current cover of
Information Week mag). Not that I particularly WANT them to fix the
infernal revenue suckers...

BTW, where do they _find_ these people? He's hacking around in Clinton's
tax records and he _doesn't_ expect Secret Service agents crawling up his
yin-yang within minutes? Obviously, "thinking too much" is _not_ this
chap's problem.
