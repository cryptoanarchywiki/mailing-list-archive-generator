Several other people have sent me e-mail saying the same thing. An odd
coincidence.... I'm glad I hedged a little bit.

I did not hedge in saying that Klemesrud represented Netcom, which turns
out to be wrong (as several people corrected me on). Klemesrud apparently
ran "support.com," which got its feed from Netcom. Sorry about any
confusion.

On the remailer subpoena thing, any Cypherpunks remailer operators who are
keeping logs might want to reconsider their strategies. And any such logs
should be purged before the subpoenas arrive.

(I understand, I think, the issues of abuse that have caused some operators
to keep logs. But since the rumors of subpoenas are in the air, now is a
good time to send the message that remailer operators _generally_ cannot
produce mappings between incoming and outgoing messages. In an ideal mix,
this is of course true. And by purging old files, it becomes de facto true
for even today's far-from-ideal mixes.)
