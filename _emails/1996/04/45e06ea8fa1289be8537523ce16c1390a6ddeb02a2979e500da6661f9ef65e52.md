Sounds like forum shopping/defendant shopping/plaintiff shopping.  An 
excellent idea.  The best part is that COS is one of the most unsympathetic 
organizations that could possibly be chosen, with the possible exception of 
the American Nazi Party or the KKK.

I sure hesitate to "hope" that the COS thing gets turned into an SC 
decision, because that means that SOME defendant has to get pulled through 
the ringer until he eventually wins.  Great for us; terrible for him.

It's at this point that somebody usually observes that the COS could use AP 
to get rid of its critics.  However, they're forgetting that with AP, its 
critics can remain absolutely anonymous and still punish COS.  It would be 
no contest.
