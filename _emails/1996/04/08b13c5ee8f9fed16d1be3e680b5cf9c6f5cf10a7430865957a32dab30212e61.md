It was ready "in time" to use against "Stalinist Russia" (which, BTW, was
Stalinist "Soviet Union,"). 
 
Both your sense of history and geography continue to be deficient.

PS: Since T.C. May and others wrote of the atomic bomb being used in the
Pacific theater I see no reason however why E.A. Smith can't discuss the
bomb in Europe. And, when I asked about the cypherpunk relevance to the
Bell/May concern over atomic weapons I was told it was relevant because the
Japanese Purple Code was involved. I infer that the new discussion on
Europe is equally relevant to cypherpunks because of Enigma and VERONA.
