Folks;

Just a small meta-request. I already filter everything Jim writes --
its all junk -- but when people reply to a message of his and send the
mail only to Cypherpunks, it is hard for me to filter the reply. If
people could make sure that he's in the To: line, or could make a
practice of putting some standardized phrase (I suggest the words 
"Jim Bell YaddaYadda") into the Subject: line it would make it easier
to filter.

Some people (especially those who don't try to do it) don't actually
understand how hard it is, technically, to heavily filter out the
noise; in the general case the problem is AI complete. Sigh.

Perry
