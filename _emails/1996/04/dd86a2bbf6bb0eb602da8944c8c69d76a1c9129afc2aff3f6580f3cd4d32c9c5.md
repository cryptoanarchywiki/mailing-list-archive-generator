I explained/retracted/fudged this in a later message.

Some of the things a valid signature from Jack the Ripper means: 

1. If it breaks something, I can send Jack the Ripper a bug report, or
   a flame, as appropriate.
2. If I like it, I can send Jack the Ripper money or other form of good
   vibes.
3. If I am Jack the Ripper, I have a way of proving that the code is my
   intellectual property.
4. If I'm not Jack the Ripper, I can say "That wasn't me."
5. If I am GNU, I can advertise and "enforce" my copyleft policy.
6. I have a way of knowing if Alice or Bob stuck a virus or trojan into
   Jack's code.

"Trust" really isn't the right word for what I'm getting at. Microsoft's
digital signature initiative is basically FUD with the spin "Only stuff
signed or endorsed by Microsoft is going to work," but I don't think that
this spin is inherent in signed code initiatives generally.

I think it would be a waste of time to build a multitiered security model
where applets with certain classes of signatures would be allowed to do
more. But signatures are still useful in a flat security model.

I think this is already all being done for Java, though, so never mind,
probably. I was just responding in a generally applicable way.
