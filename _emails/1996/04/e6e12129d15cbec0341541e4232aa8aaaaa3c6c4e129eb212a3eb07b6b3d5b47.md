Absolutly, and it seems that more and more thinking people are 
realizing this, as for the non-thinking ones, well we are better off 
without them, the only thing they contribute are problems

Debate works to a point, but there comes a point and time where all 
that can be said, has been said, and we are past that point.

Personally, I love national insecurity such as terrorist attacks and 
random bombings, wish there were more of them by more people.

What they do is sow fear, instensify camps, and pit people against 
each other.  

Goverments are use to wars, where there are large, well-defined 
groups assult one another, they have huge problems dealing with small 
groups of people attack it or each other.  That is what will 
eventually cause it to collapes, which is a good thing.

For those who say that such an event would be catostrophic, that is a 
myth, I worked with someone from Berut a few years ago, when the 
goverment there collapesed.  He said other than the perpetual mortor 
fire, and speratic bombings, life went on as usuall.  People got up 
and went to work, people bought and sold, etc.  From a microsopic 
scale, nothing had changed, it was only if you looked at the bigger 
picture that things were different, and quite frankly, those types of 
things do not effect us individually.

I do not need an x trillion dollar economy to continue living at my 
standard of living, most of us on this list do not, the only people 
that benifit are the power brokers and the dumb, weak, and stupid.

I have nothing against charity(that's what taxes amount to), but when charity 
reaches 50%+  of my income, and starts to erode my freedom, well now it's
a problem.
