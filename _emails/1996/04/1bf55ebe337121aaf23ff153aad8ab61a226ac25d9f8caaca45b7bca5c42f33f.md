I was curious about the below message, and checked... 

MSN uses CHAP (PPP's challenge-response handshake) for network layer
authetication, and NTLM (Windows NT's challenge-response handshake) for
application-layer authentication. The password is never sent in across
the network. Challenge-responses encrypted with the password are sent.

|| Yes, windows95 dialup networking uses compression to send the
password

||
||| Problem Description: Microsoft being security conscious and all, I
||| would hope that when I connect to MSN over the Internet, that my MSN
||| client has the decency to ENCRYPT my password when it sends it over
the
||| net,  yes?  This is the first time I couldn't get through to a
dial-up
||| connection and had to access MSN using my ISP.  Having done so, I
find
||| it extrememly convenient, and would like to continue to do so. 
Thanks.
