While we may disagree with Ms. Denning on a number of political matters,
she's quite intelligent; I suspect the paper is well-founded.

GPS receivers are line-of-sight only; only a small portion of the earth can
see the same satellites.

GPS works by measuring the differing distances to a number of satellites.
Thus, a crucial factor of GPS reception is not just the signals from
satellites, but the different times at which these signals were received.

It might be possible to seperately record the signals from several
different satellites, delay them each just the right amount of time, and
then recombine them to simulate being at another nearby location (within
several hundred miles). However, this might not be possible. Examine the
following quote from Denning's paper:

:The location signature is virtually impossible to forge at the
:required accuracy. This is because the GPS observations at any given time
:are essentially unpredictable to high precision due to subtle satellite
:orbit perturbations, which are unknowable in real-time, and intentional
:signal instabilities  (dithering) imposed by the U.S. Department of Defense
:selective availability (SA) security policy.

It's possible that the orbit perturbations may be enough to screw up an
attempt to forge a signal; the variations in signal timings won't provide
enough information to an attacker to be able to accurately replicate what
the signal would look like at another location. It remains to be seen
whether it is reliably possible for the secure host, at its location, to
distinguish between an accurate signature and an inaccurate but plausible
forged signature.

Selective Availability doesn't really seem to matter that much, especially
since it's going to be phased out. (There was an announcement on this last
week, but I can't find a reference right now).
