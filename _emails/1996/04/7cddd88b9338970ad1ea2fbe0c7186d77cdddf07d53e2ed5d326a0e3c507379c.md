I am a professional freelance editor and copyeditor.  It is my job to
see that the language used by authors conforms to the rigid dictates of
style, spelling, and grammar.

As an experienced professional in this field, I have learned that where
rules of spelling, grammar, vocabulary come from is *usage*.  Words
become accepted parts of the language because people start to use them. 
The acceptance of words is recognized by their adoption in to lexicons
and dictionaries, but this is description, not prescription.

If you want to be linguistically correct and ensure that 'onyma'
prevails over 'nym,' you've got a lot of catching up to do.  'Nym' is
is clearly established by usage on the Cypherpunks list, and I expect
it's only a matter of time before it starts showing up in print media,
if it hasn't already, and get listings in the Jargon File, then
dictionaries, etc.

You can't fight usage; it is usage that makes the language as she is
spoke what it is.
