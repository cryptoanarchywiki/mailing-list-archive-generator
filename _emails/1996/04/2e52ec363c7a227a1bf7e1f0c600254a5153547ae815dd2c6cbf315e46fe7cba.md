I agree with you and I'll go further and state that the use of "nym" is due
to it being the suffix of all the terms that are lumped into it _AND_ is
spoken in them as a separate (and last) syllable. Use of ONYM would not be
as obvious since the "o" is _part_ of the prior syllable _not_ the prior
syllable (also none of the words use ONYMA so that is also not a good term
to the general public <g>). This is a case of using the last syllable of a
number of terms/words as a generic term for all of them (or the use of that
syllable as a generic suffix to other words to create a new term with the
connotation of that suffix's meaning [as in using -ism at the end of other
words]).
