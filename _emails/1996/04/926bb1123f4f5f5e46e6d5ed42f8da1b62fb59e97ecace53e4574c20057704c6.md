It means that the laser burns itself up when fired.  Either they are pumping
gas into the laser and eventually run out or they are using something that
is solid or semi-solid (yes, you can make a laser out of Jello!) that
becomes non-functional after a certain number of uses.

The plans I have for a somewhat high powered laser (10 watts) requires
nitrogen pumped through the tube.  Run out of nitrogen and you run out of
laser...

The problem with laser based weapons is they are weather dependant.  Try
using a laser in the rain and see how coherent a beam you get.

What this has to do with crypto, I have no idea...  (Maybe they are going to
try and etch RSA in four lines of Perl into the side of the whitehouse.)
