        I brought this up with SFNB a month or so ago (when I opened my
account) and the word then was that client side certificates would be
avaible within a month or so, my time guestimate (based on what they were
saying) was half-a-year.

        Let's hope so, I am not keeping significant funds in that account
until I have a certificate.

        I hope Eric Young does attempt to crack a 40-bit SFNB session as he
mentioned on cpx today.

        I suspected this, and was further exposed because of a common
problem with using Netscape and the like from student accounts (with a big
10M quota), say on MIT's athena, where I like my disk cache to reside in the
workstations /tmp . I wipe(d) it whenever I log out, but I'm sure others
sprinkled their passwords in a million "public" cache's before SFNB stuck
the tag no-cache tag in. 

OBJava: do java applets have access to the cache, would it be possible to
write one of the little nasties that keep an eye on the cache?

        Indeed! How many people use their easily crack "ftp:/etc/passwds"
password for SFNB?
