I am not a lawyer.

Hooks to encryption code have *sometimes* been considered
"ancillary devices" and as such are in violation of ITAR.

Calling another executable like pgp *might* be less of an
issue than having source code hooks that call crypto library
routines, but maybe not.  (And no I don't understand why
they would be different)

NCSA had something related to this in their use of PEM/PGP
in httpd.  See some info at:  

  http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/PEMPGP.html

which says:

  Note: As of NCSA HTTPd 1.4.1, support for PEM/PGP encryption
  was removed in order to bring NCSA in compliance with the
  Internation Treaty on Arms Reduction to which the United
  States of America is a signatory. We hope to have an
  improved version available with NCSA HTTPd 1.5 from an
  export controlled server.

In sum, check with a lawyer.

Howard
