I think it is best to have a black box that can not be modeled personally. 
Anyway I am in the middle of putting together a portable RNG that will should 
consist of nothing more than a photoelectric tube, 9volt battery, and a bit of 
wiring. It will connect through the serial port. Just put your favorite 
radioactive substance near it and your set. before people freak out, there are 
many substances that will produce enough beta particles without killing 
anyone. In fact you could just use background radiation, but it would take 
longer. Anyway I'll let you all know how it turns out.
