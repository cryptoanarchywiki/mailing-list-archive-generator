Actualy the data in a PROM is not electrostic, it is quite dynamic and the
chip itself would undergo no permanent damage if removed from the original
case and examined in the right environment (namely a good vacuum).

Only if you are sloppy and/or don't understand the technology.

Not. Not only woud SQUID technology be applicable but STM and MNR
technologies would also be applicable to this type of hardware analysis. The
chip is simply to big to prevent this type of analysis. Get it down to
atomic scale (nanotech) and SQUIDs are about your only resource.
