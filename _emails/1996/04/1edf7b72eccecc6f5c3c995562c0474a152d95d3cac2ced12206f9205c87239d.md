Perry's right: giving up any statistical information is too much.
 
A slightly contrived example of why tossing out duplicated bytes is bad:
 
Suppose that a military organization is using this almost one-time-pad
system, and my spies tell my they've fallen into the habit of sending
"attack" and "defend" as their only 6-byte messages.  This isn't a problem
with a real one-time pad (except for traffic analysis...), but this lets
me determine the message 3.8% of the time!
 
For example, if I see:
 
0xfce8e8c7f4f7 (cyphertext I see)
 
which was generated by:
 
  d e f e n d  (message)
0x646566656e64 (message in hex)
0x988d8ea29a93 (pad)
 
Then I know that I'm not going to be attacked.  Attack couldn't have had
the e8e8, because they threw out those pads.

That's plenty big to be a problem.
