Since E.A. Smith wants completeness re the Zundelsite issue, I am curious
about his assertion about Weaver. 
 
Might we know the source of his complete info on Weaver's political and
racial beliefs. 
 
I see, in essence, three hypothesis: 
 
1) Cover the ass of a potential neo-Nazi or racist (or both) without any
reference to what is really true; 
 
2) Get information from outer space; 
 
3) Base the conclusion on hard evidence. 
 
If the answer is 3) I'd like to get a real pointer to the real evidence. By
real evidence I mean just that, not wishful thinking or advertising jingles
for points 1) or 2).
