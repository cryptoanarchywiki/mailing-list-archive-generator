>Defendants [The feds. Ed.]also
>conclude summarily that both the definition of cryptographic software
>and the exemptions from this definition are clear to a person of

>it is a confession, since the ODTC itself mistakenly classified
>Bernstein's academic paper as a defense article under Category XIII.
