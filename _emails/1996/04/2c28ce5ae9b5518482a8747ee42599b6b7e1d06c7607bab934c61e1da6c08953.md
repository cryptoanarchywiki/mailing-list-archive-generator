Interesting. Thanks for explaining your terms. I disagree with everything
you're saying. :-)

I consider "racist" to be an ideological label, not an insult at all
(though personally, I find them sick and wrong). There's a lot of people
out there who proudly call themselves racists, at least in private. Many
of them I can have a civilized discussion with. For me, liar is a stronger
word.

I think it's good to keep the FBI informed, in general terms only. Keeps
the FBI from wigging out, you know. Self-conscious "infiltrators" and
especially "provocateurs" I would consider to be liars, but someone who
merely keeps the lines of communication open is a friend of mine.

Who has defended the government's lies and shoot-at-sight rules of
engagement at Ruby Ridge? Please be specific. I think you're talking about
some straw man you read about in an NRA or militia pamplet.
