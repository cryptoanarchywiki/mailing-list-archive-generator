I'm sure it has been. That doesn't mean his report is untrue.  Is the
standard of proof the same for both of these issues?  We need proof to
establish that Weaver is a racist, but not to establish that the FBI
informant is lying?

Separatist/supremacist...  I don't see much difference between them, and I
believe the former is largely just a cover story for the latter.  Weaver
is no hero, IMHO, though I believe the govt. fucked up big at Ruby Ridge.
