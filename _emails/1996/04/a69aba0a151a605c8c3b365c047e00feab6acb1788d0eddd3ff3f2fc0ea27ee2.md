What about making Virus binaries available for download? Someone I know has
been thinking about putting the famous "Outlaws" CD on the web, to provide
a one-stop place for unrestricted virus information, including source code
and live viruses. Of course the user has to accept an agreement that they
will use the information for research purposes only.
