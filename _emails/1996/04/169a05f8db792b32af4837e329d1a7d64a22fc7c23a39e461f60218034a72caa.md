Saw a CNN story Friday about an interesting special debit card 
application in Mexico.  They're being issued to poor Mexicans, who can 
use them to buy tortillas and a few other foodstuffs.  The cards are tied to 
a behavior-control database and failure to send kids to school, get 
mandatory medical exams/treatments/vaccinations, etc. results in card 
deactivation.
