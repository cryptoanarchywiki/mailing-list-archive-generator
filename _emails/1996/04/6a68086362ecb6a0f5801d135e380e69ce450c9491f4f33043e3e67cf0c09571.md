The Black Unicorn indicates that if the reason the secrets _cannot_ be
retrieved is because they are in a jurisdiction which refuses to reveal
them when the owner is under compulsion, the owner can still be punished
for contempt (A contractual situation).

I don't know what would happen if they _cannot_ be retrieved for technical
reasons.  If a communication key was aggreeded to be DH exchange and then
discarded, I would think this would be analogous to asking for a document
that was destroyed (before the subpoena) as part of a policy of destroying
obsolete documents.
