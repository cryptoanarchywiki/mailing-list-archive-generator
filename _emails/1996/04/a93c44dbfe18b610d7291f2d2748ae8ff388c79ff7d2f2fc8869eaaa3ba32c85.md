Eric Thomas's LISTSERV has had a feature for 4 or 5 years that prevents
spoofed subscription requests. The list owner can configure the mailing
list so that whenever a subscription request is received, LISTSERV
e-mails the apparent sender and asks to e-mail it 'OK nnnn', where 'nnnn'
is a pseudo-random string uniquely identifying this request. If the
confirmation isn't received within 48 hours, LISTSERV ignores the command.

Similar confirmations can be requested for other commands, like unsubcribe.

Works like a charm without any public key crypto or digital signatures.
