By the way, I certainly was not making a personal condemnation of Uni, or
of Jim Bell for that matter. I was mainly making the point that Sandy's
point about setting up a wager is problematic (in fact, Uni makes the same
points vis-a-vis his view of how Bell might start finagling about the terms
of any bet--this was in fact seen during the Extropians experiments, and is
what I meant when I said that more time would be spent debating the
bet....).

I admit that I once I wrote the word "the Unibells" (Uni + Bell, of
course), I liked the ring of it (:-}) and used it for the thread title as
well.

I was serious that I deleted unread the Bell/Unicorn rants; I suspect
nearly all others do as well, so their time spent on these messages these
last several weeks was even more of a waste.
