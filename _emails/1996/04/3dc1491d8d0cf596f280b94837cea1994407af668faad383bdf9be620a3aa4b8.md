I received several responses to this question.  My favorite was as follows...

Still, I'm left feeling a little uneasy.
My reasons for this are

1) Trusting the processor means trusting something I don't fully understand.
2) Processors these days are extremely complex.
3) On April 3rd, at Interop, Peter Neumann (in his keynote presentation)
disclosed that a random number generator chip used in slot machines had
been compromised.  This lead to a huge bogus jackpot, and an investigation
that revealed the scheme.

It looks like I may have no other option than to give some processor some
degree of trust. Which processor I should choose, and why that one?

TIA,
Jeff
