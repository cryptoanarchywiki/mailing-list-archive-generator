Sorry, but I couldn't shut up here.  Isn't this list about the free flow of
cryptographic information?  Let's not be like the government and shut down
what we talk about because we don't want certain people to know about the
technology.

Of course, your posting probably came out with tongue firmly in cheek, but
hey, censorship is still censorship (is still shit, thank you CDA.)

ObOtherListComplaint (doesn't everyone?):  Has anyone suffered ill-effects
by having their mail program filter Jim Bell's postings?  Perhaps a
10-point-rise in their IQs?  "Bytes are ALWAYS 8 bits" indeed.  Has this
child never been exposed to anything but PCs?  Go dig up the manuals for a
UNIVAC 1100, Jim.  Why do you think the RFCs for IP specifically refer to
"octets" as opposed to "bytes"?  Because (they explain) "octet" is
unambiguous, which then infers a certain ambiguity to "byte", now, doesn't it?

-j, I'll go back to lurking now for a while...
