The logo they have at www.rsa.com is two modern-style keys (like we all 
have on our keychains) fit together at the teeth. The key on the 
"Golden Key Campaign" and on Netscape looks more like an old-style 
thing, a circle on the end of a long bar with two teeth at the end.

I'd say the RSA logo (the one at their web site) looks nothing like the 
one on the envelope.

Yes, but from the previous post, it sounds like PRZ supports this.

Financially, RSA *does* have a hell of a lot to gain from relaxed 
export controls. OTOH, I would think that other companies would be able 
to sell RSA-patented encryption, just not to inside the USA (IANAL). Of 
course, that inside-the-USA factor is a very big one.

IMNSHO, relaxed export controls would be much better than the status
quo, even if R$A does have exclusive milking rights to that global cow. 
One company selling crypto, even with a monopoly, is better than no
companies selling crypto. Besides, the patent on public-key crypto won't
last forever. 

I think I'll put the golden key on my web pages, right alongside the
blue ribbon.
