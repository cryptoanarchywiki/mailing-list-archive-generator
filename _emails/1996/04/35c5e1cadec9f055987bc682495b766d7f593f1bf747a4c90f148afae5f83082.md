There's no question about the thugs *arriving*. They're already here.
Fighting them is an internal political battle, not an external battle. Yes
they're clueless about the net, so in that sense you might see the
CDAmeisters as an "invasion," but I really don't buy this stuff about
Cyberspace (a word only Barlow can say with a straight face) being a new
"place." It's just a communications medium, no more and no less real than
anything else. I think it would be better to stress that the online *is*
real life. Your money and gigs of information about you is online. It can
be a force for freedom, or a force for totalitarianism. Right now, the
momentum is entirely in the wrong direction, both online and in "real
life."
