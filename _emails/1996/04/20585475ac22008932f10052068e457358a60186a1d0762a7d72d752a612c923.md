	I was only thinking in terms of US Courts.

	Black Unicorn didn't limit himself to that.
	His citations are early than 1900.  
	Think Ecclesiastical Courts.   Or use Lexis.

	Why doesn't that surprise me?   You raised the conditional
	"for graphological purposes".

	I guess you didn't read any of the SC decision.  It was
	only for Questioned Document Examination.

	So you totally ignore what was practiced.  Thus creating
	hypothetical situations that could never have occured.

	I guess you are not familiar with the _current_ requirements 
	for one to be qualified as an expert witness in court.

	Or studied _Federal Rules for Evidence_.   

	Or faced a hostile attorney whose sole intent is to 
	totally discredit you, because the facts don't support 
	the client's allegations.  

> "current government policy" must be right?

	Given a choice between being able to prove my innocence,
	based on scientifically demonstrable facts, or on the
	heresay of unsubstantiated opinion, I'd rather use the
	scientific facts, anytime.  

	And as you've been told, the items you gave in your list
	were for identification of an individual.
