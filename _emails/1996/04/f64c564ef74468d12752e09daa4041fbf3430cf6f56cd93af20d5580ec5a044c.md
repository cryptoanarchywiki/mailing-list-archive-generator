Tell this to Unicorn.  He seems to disagree, although he hasn't cited specifics yet.

Adding the conditional "for graphological purposes," I can't.  I was merely 
referring to a SC decision previously quoted here.  The writing of that 
reference didn't make clear what purposes the sample could be used for.

If that's really the case, and this would today be considered a clear violation of the 5th, what does that say about the claim that "current government policy" must be right?
