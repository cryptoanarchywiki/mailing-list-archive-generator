I know.  I've no formal legal training, and picked up "The Common Law"
to try to get an understaning of "lawyer-think", not to learn the law.
You use what you know, though.

I'd argue that I'm holding everyone to the same standard:  either know
the safe ways of handling viruses and follow them, or don't handle them
at all.  You seem to imply that I'd hold the untrained virus writer
harmless.  No way.  He's reckless and *should* be liable.  When one has
training, it's no longer reckless to simply handle (or write) the
virus, but disregarding safe procedures is negligent.

I assume that a canonical example of the lower-standard case is the
"Good Samaritan" laws which reduce the liability of a trained person
performing rescue activities (e.g., administering CPR).

It seems to me that the "reasonable person" isn't the real issue
there.  Someone with training ought to be expected to do the "right"
thing.  If you're trained to administer CPR, and you do it *wrong*, you
shouldn't be absolved of liability -- you're negligent.  If you don't
know anything about CPR (except what you've seen on "Baywatch"), then
we're back to what a "reasonable person" should do.  If you're trained
and you do it right, but the person is still injured by your actions,
limiting your liability is society's way of encouraging you to use
your training for the common good.

In my mind, the difference between the objective standard and the
subjective one marks the difference between recklessness and
negligence.  If an objective "reasonable person" wouldn't do it, it's
reckless.  If a subjective "reasonable person" wouldn't, it's
negligent.

Perhaps these aren't the "legalese" usages of the terms, but it seems
reasonable to me.

I'd be interested.
