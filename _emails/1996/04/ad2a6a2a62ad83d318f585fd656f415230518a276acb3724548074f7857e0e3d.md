# This is one of the more worrisome places for a bug to exist.  Much of
# Java's security rests in the claim that it can screen for and detect bad
# bytecode sequences.  This screening code is extremely critical for Java
# security and I am surprised to see that it was implemented in a flawed

As I keep saying (multiple times, in multiple forums) "Java is still in
Beta-Test."  Sun acks/grocks this, although Netscape ships most of their
production-level browsers with Java enabled by default.

The primary reason for releasing beta software is to catch any discrepancies
between the documented behaviour and the implimented behaviour of a product.
Bugs WILL be found in beta testing.

To reiterate: "If you insist on being on the bleeding edge, you WILL bleed."

This has been a test of the emergency reality-check service.
Had this been a real reality-check, the software in question would be labeled
"golden" and you would be provided with a "support@foo.bar.com" email address
to contact for your product.

Again this is only a test, and is (as such) non flamable.  Any party that might
take offense to this message should re-read the contents of the message, and
either A) re-evaluate their perception of it, or B) re-evaluate their
practices.
