And based on an actual happening. Wolfram reasoned that the Soviets must've
had a "secret city of cryptographers," as they had secret cities for
several other kinds of military scientists (rockets, atomic energy, CBW,
metallurgy, etc.). He speculated that the U.S. should locate this city and
see if the residents needed jobs.

And of course several people have speculated that if the "P ?=? NP" ball of
wax has been solved by anyone, in secret, the Russians are a good bet,
given their strong skills in pure mathematics. (And my choice of Kolmogorov
was not just a name made up...)

I first floated this April Fool's Day joke two years ago...I figured enough
time had passed and enough newcomers had subscribed to make it worth
posting again. Wolfram actually saw the copy two years ago and liked it.
