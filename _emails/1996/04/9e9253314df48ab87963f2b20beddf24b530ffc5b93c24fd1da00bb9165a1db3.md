I believe Sandy was on the Extropians list at the same time I was (and
maybe after I left), and must recall that this was tried. The Extropians
tried several of these "market-based dispute resolution" schemes, including
wagers on debates.

In my view, all failed. Wagers and bets consumed far more list time to
discuss, argue about, and (sometimes) resolve than the experiment was
worth. Basically, not too surprising, as the actual stakes were quite low
and the real-world consequences small. "Wiggle room" was always argued for,
and "mediators" or "arbitrators" to decide the winner were hard to find for
many of the bets.

And many of the bets were poorly-formulated, at least in terms of having a
neutral third party decide the outcome.

(I don't doubt that better formulations are possible....it just requires a
lot of work, and the stakes need to be worthwhile. Mediators have to get a
big enough cut of the action to make it worthwhile for them to get
involved. It takes motivation and effort to get inolved, and I can't see
anyone with an IQ over 120--a slacker on this list--wanting to get involved
in the "yadda-yadda-yadda" debate between the Unibells.)

I find it much easier to just let Jim Bell and Black Unicorn rant at each
other. I delete their rants and insults. I figure if this keeps them
occupied for hours every night, to each their own.
