- I've heard several people make this statement...  Can anyone confirm that
- it is really possible to log the uid (username) of the person making the
- http request?  I know they can get your ip address, but I'm skeptical
- of getting the username.

    Yes, there are several web interfaces to anonymous remailers out 
there (check altavista). No, they cannot get your username UNLESS you 
have logged into the site by entering a username and password into a 
www auth dialogue box -or- you are on a Unix box which is running 
identd -and- the remote site runs a check (unlikely and DOES NOT 
apply to dialups, unless you are running identd on your dialup).
    Even in the extremely unlikely event of a remailer running a 
check using identd, that would not show up in the standard web logs.
    It would be theorically possible to get a username/True Name
from an IP address if you were on a dialup and the ISP kept track of 
who was on what dialup and when.
