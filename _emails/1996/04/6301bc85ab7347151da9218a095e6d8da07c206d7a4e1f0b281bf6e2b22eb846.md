Let's hope that this is really true. Your point about C is an excellent
one, as certainly the "lingua franca" of C pretty much failed, except when
enough work was done to properly port an application.

(However, the bytecode/JVM approach exacts some performance penalty, albeit
partially ameliorated with JIT compilers that are likely to be widely
available. Some apps will just have to be tuned for speed. But when I look
at most crypto apps such as we are ultimately interested in--digital money,
mixes, crypto protocol building blocks, etc.--I see that first and foremost
they aren't getting done and distributed. The applet model looks pretty
good here.)

One interesting remark I read from someone was that the Java distribution
model returns us to an era of easier distribution of small programs. The
"application bloat" of very large programs may be at least partly fixed.
We'll see.

My background in programming was in Lisp when I was with Intel (I started
Intel's AI lab and was the first person to look at neural nets for them),
and then Smalltalk for "fun." But, like I said recently, I knew that
Smalltalk had about zero chance of becoming widely used, despite fairly
impressive year-to-year growth rates. (I also got Lightspeed C in '86, but
barely played with it over the years...good intentions, though.)

Anyway, Mike is right that Java is a lot of fun. Enough good OO stuff to
keep Smalltalk folks happy, but with familiar C syntax. And going to
garbage collection/eliminating pointers is a major plus for reducing errors
and headaches.

A huge number of books are hitting the shelves. Besides the "Teach Yourself
Java in 21 Days" book, I really like "Core Java," a hefty tome with lots of
asides about how Java compares to C, C++, Lisp, and Smalltalk, and with
more of the "rationale" than most of the other books. The "Java in a
Nutshell" book is also well-regarded. And Peter van der Linden's "Just
Java" is good. (These are the four I have, and my eyes haven't been glazing
over yet.)

Gosling's book arrives soon. I looked at an advanced draft and it looks
excellent, too.

I agree with all of Mike's points.

Interestingly, I've been having an e-mail dialog with a friend who avers
that Java is just another temporary fad, just another ho-hum interpreted
language. He claims that Perl and TCL were similar fads, and didn't change
the world.

I disagree with him, of course. I think the flood of books, compilers,
incorporations into browsers and operating systems, etc. is strong evidence
that Java is a bit more than just this year's version of TCL.

But, the great thing about a market anarchy is that people get to vote. By
deciding what to buy, what to work on, what to build applications with, and
so forth.

The first "killer applet" (tm) will be what?

(There's a fair chance it could be a digital commerce applet, something to
exploit correctly the pent-up demand for online purchases....I can imagine
folks on this very list becoming the Scott Cook's of this market....)
