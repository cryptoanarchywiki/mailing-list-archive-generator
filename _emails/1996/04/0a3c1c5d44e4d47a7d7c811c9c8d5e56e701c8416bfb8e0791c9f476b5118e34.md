	Thank you for your support (although I am not named Bartles or James),
but I don't _think_ that tallpaul was calling me a Nazi sympathizer. Doing so
would be thoroughly inaccurate, and would be contradicted by my previous
statements re: Nazi Germany (one reason for Hiroshima and Nagasaki being right
was the Japanese alliance with Germany) and the Holocaust (people who claim
it didn't happen are calling my paternal grandfather a liar).
