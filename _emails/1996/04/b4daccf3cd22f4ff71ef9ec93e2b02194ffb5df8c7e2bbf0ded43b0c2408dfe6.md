The most recent use of a non-8-bit byte I can find is from 1994 (no typo,
2 years ago).  It's a spec for a RAM cell in ASIC design, and the usage is 
more or less "smallest individually writable memory unit".  By design,
bits must be written in chunks (bytes!), which in this case are 22 bits.

As much as I'd like byte to be a standard, unambiguous 8-bits, there's
still other uses out ther, which is why even recent RFCs specify
octets instead of bytes.

That said, I agree that older CS references aren't a reliable indicator
of modern usage.
