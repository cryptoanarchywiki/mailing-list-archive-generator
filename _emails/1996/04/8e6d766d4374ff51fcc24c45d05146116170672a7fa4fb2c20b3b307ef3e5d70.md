No, it's not broken, it just interacts badly with anon.penet.fi.
Of the two of them, majordomo is doing the obvious unsurprising thing,
while anon.penet.fi needs a bit more complicated support because of
difficulties with its implication and the workarounds it uses.
Somebody did comment that they modified majordomo to handle this,
but presumably vanilla majordomo can at least pattern-match block an######,
and if it can't, you can always pre-process with egrep or sed.
