Thank you, Declan.  

Grady is a sharp guy and he spent hours with the church lawyers.  If he 
thinks this is likely to happen I would take the possibility seriously.  
I sent the note to Jim Warren because I thought the community should know 
of the possibility.  A little advance notice might enable someone to 
prepare a legal defense.  I hope that remailers will resist turning over 
their records even if there is no useful information in them.  

We'll probably know in a few days whether Grady's guess is correct.  

Meanwhile, if you are going to pass my letter around please snip the 
personal stuff.  

Shelley
