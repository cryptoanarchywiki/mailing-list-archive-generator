There are two major security enhancements of a "fundamental nature" that
are being discussd, that I know of:

1. Sun and JavaSoft are talking about "signed classes," using full-blown
digital signatures, in a future release. Some of the Java developers talked
at a Cypherpunks meeting last June or so about this (before Java became so
hot and they would only speak at Moscone Center before crowds of 1000 and
up).

2. Electric Communities has developed a superset of Java called E,
available for downloading and whatnot at http://www.communities.com/. It
offers a set of capability-based security features which are quite
interesting.

(Several Cypherpunks work at EC, of course.)
