I think this will depend on how easy it is to withdraw ecash.  If the
client software includes an option of automaticly withdrawing ecash from
the bank when you don't have enough ecash to pay for the current purchase
(thereby reducing the time between withdrawal and deposit to zero), then I
suspect most people will use it, even though (anticipating your next
question) this compromises their untraceability.

The untraceability of ecash does depend on a time delay between withdrawal
and deposit.  It's analogous to the fact that the untraceability of
anonymous e-mail depend on a time delay between sending and receiving.  I
think you're probably right that the interest lost is a price the consumer
must pay for untraceability.

One possible way to get around this is to have ecash issuers pay interest
on ecash.  However it requires ecash to be timestamped and therefore
compromises its untraceability.  (Think of the timestamp as a serial
number.)
