DES (and other block ciphers) has a couple of modes that let you do
this -- CFB mode and OFB mode come to mind. Their security hasn't been
that well studied to my knowledge. However...

You ought to explain your application more clearly; it isn't
necessarily the case that a stream cipher is appropriate for you.
