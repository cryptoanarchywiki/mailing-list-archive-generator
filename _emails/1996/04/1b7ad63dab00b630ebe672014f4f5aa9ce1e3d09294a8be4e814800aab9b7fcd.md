If they're handling money, then, yes, the paranoia is probably necessary.
Aside from the 40-bit vs. 128-bit issue, one of the big security risks of SSL
and similar systems is that the server they run on is typically sitting right
out there on the Internet waiting for somebody to crack it, and keeping
credit card information on the same rather than handing the encrypted
information
across some secure interface (whether a firewall or dedicated RS232 or
whatever.)
A bulletproof 128-bit interface doesn't help if it's running on a cracked
machine.
Putting it on a separate firewalled machine is a Good Thing.
