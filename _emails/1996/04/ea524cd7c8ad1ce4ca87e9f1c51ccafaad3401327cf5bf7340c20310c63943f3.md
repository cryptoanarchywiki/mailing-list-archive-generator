There are several commercial probes available, not a single source as you
claim. The Air Force has used them in experimental fighter programs for
several years allowing hands-off flying (in a simulator) with quite good
results. Quite a few neurophysiologists use them along with NMR to map the
neuronal activity of the human brain on a neuron by neuron basis. The folks
who make the various flavors of super-conducting wire use them to test for
imperfections in the product. I sugest that your familiarity with the SQUID
technology might be a little dated. Take the time to contact Conductus.

I didn't make that assertion. I clearly offered it as a source of education
and entertainment. I even went so far as to specificaly predicate my recital
with this caveat.

While Mr. SQUID might be able to do it, the other commercial probes out
there would have no problem from reading your smart card on a transistor by
transistor state if that is what were required.
