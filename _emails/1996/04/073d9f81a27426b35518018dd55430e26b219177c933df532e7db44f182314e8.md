Yes. When an intermediate message is decrypted, the real message becomes
readable, but the random bytes stay random. Thus, your proposal is
secure against attacks on the link, but fails to attacks on the nodes
(i.e. reveals just as information as if padding had not been used).

I was suffering from the same confusion myself until fairly recently. I
even made a proposal for text-based type-3 remailer formats, which
contained this flaw.
