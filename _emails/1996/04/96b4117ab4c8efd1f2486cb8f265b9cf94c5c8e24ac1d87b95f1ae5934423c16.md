I also think that an "Enemies List" would not be useful... It would only 
make people believe that the Cypherpunks are a bunch of anti-government 
terrorists.

A list would not be a problem in itself, after all the governments keep
their lists of "subversives". Maybe there should be a "Luddite List"...

  Ludd-ite n. (Eng. hist.) a member of those groups of workers who 
  deliberately smashed machinery in the industrial centers of the East 
  Midlands, Lancashire and Yorksire (1811-16), believing it to be a cause 
  of unemployment [after Ned Ludd, a late 18th-c. riot leader]

Of course, "Luddite" is usually used with a more general meaning, refering
to people who are ignorant of and/or resisting technology. I think it's a
very good word to use. It's apropriately demeaning, but not hateful. I
think it's a word that could be accepted and understood by the general
public. 

Just a thought.
