Not that it really matters, but you're wrong; if you're talking about an
asynchronous data stream, a byte is however many bits it takes to express
one character. If you're using ASCII, it's 8; if you're using Baudot, it's
5. If you're talking about data in computers, then I think you're right, a
byte is always 8 bits.
