That's funny; maybe I'll check it out in my spare time. Yeah, right.

The scary thing is, there are people who actually BELIEVE that shit. Or,
from the "other side," Clancy's rants, or The Turner Diaries, or Marx's
poor algebra in Das Kapital. You shouldn't base your life on fiction.

I'd guess that there are no more than 5,000 serious Nazis left in the
whole world who actually favor totalitarianism and genocide. It's quite
obvious who they are. They're not a threat, but it's probably good to
harry them, because otherwise, they might become a threat. (The 5K
estimate does *not* include other totalitarian/genocidal movements, and
I'm not interested in debating parallels. When I say "Nazi," which is
pretty rare, I mean "Nazi," someone who has read and agrees with the
"Nation and Race" chapter of Mein Kampf.)

Disinformation is stronger than a lot of people think. Or maybe I'm just
saying that :-)

My academic work involved Latin American revolutionary movements. I have
some idea.

Never thought of it that way, but I believe that's the crux of the
problem...
