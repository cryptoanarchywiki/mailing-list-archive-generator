Tom does not work for Netcom or represent them, AFAIK.

He is the sysop of the BBS (support.com) that Dennis uses to access the
Net.  The BBS gets its net feed through Netcom.

CoS sued both Tom and Netcom (in addition to Dennis).  They claimed that
after alerting Tom and Netcom to Dennis' alleged "copyright terrorism"
the ISPs should have cut off his net access.  Tom refused, and Netcom
didn't want to pull the plug on his whole BBS just to stop one man accused
of copyright infringement.

I hope I have that all straight...
