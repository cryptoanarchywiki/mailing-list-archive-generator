Well, that isn't exactly how digest authentication works.
In fact mister barber should figure out what he is talking about
before saying anything.  But, you can't really use a hash function
to send the new password.

Once again mister barber is being an idiot.  netscape is not a "large number
of browsers".  He is right that ssl is probably a good way to go. (shttp would
be better :) )

You might be able to hack something together with java that did some kind of
clever thing, but then you are limited again.

CGI just isn't made for sending secure information.

As far as digest (MD5) authenitcation goes, I know that the spyglass
browser, and most of its derivatives (like m-soft i-net explorer) can use
it.  I know cause I did a lot of the QA on it.  The real problem is finding
a server that supports it.  I don't know if apache or ncsa do, but they
could probably be hacked to do it.  If you download a spyglass server, I
know it works (I did a lot of the early QA on that too ).  

But that probably doesn't  help too much.
You should probaly find something better than the web to do it.
