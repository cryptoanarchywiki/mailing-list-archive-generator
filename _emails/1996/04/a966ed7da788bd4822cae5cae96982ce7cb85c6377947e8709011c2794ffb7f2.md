Funny.  I had the *exact* same idea a couple of months ago.  However, I
did find several flaws in it.

Perhaps the address could be hashed several times for the table look-up and
then the address could be hashed a less number of times for decryption with
the IDEA key.  This reduces the amount of code needed and also eliminates
any problems with only using 128 bits of SHA output.

In the scheme I thought of, a password would be sent with the message, which
would be hashed, appended to the hash of the address, and then hashed again
to get the decryption key.

Searching for the real address behind a pseudonym is not hard at all.  Just
hash the anonymous address, look it up in the table, then decrypt the
cooresponding encrypted address.  This was the major flaw that I spotted with
this scheme.

The only other problem I found is a pretty minor one: the address database
would be twice as large as it would be if it was stored in plaintext.  I
don't think that much security is gained by using this scheme.
