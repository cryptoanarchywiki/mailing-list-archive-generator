	Agreed (re:freedom) ... but why are you claiming that real estate
taxes are regressive? Unless there's some nonsense like Louisiana's homestead
exemption (own your own home, get 100,000 subtracted off of the value for
property tax purposes... which is just as biased against apartment-dwellers
and renters as the morgage interest deduction), real estate taxes should be
even or "progressive" in their distribution of the tax burden.
