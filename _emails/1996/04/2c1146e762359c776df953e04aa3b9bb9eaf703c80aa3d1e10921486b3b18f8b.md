Obviously you need to mix raw data with a hash function if you really
want to smear out the entropy so there's an even amount per output byte.
But lossless compression can gain you a little bit, and seldom hurts
(assuming it's faster than the hash), and it can help you be less 
unrealistic about the amount of entropy you've really got.

Data contains varying quantities of predictablity and unpredictability.
Some of the predictability has simple enough structure that a basic
compression function can find and exploit it to squash the data.
Some of the predictability doesn't.  For what it's worth, compressing
the data before using it for other things does leave you with somewhat
more consistent entropy per byte for "typical" random input, because it
eliminates the easy stuff.  Obviously there are cases where this doesn't
help you much, like inputting a graphic representation of a column of
Chinese characters, where you'd benefit a lot more by looking them up
and outputting Unicode or some such and then compressing (and where the 
first time you encounter a given character, the output of the compression
function has to represent the picture, where the next time it sees the
same set of input bits, it's able to abbreviate much more.)
