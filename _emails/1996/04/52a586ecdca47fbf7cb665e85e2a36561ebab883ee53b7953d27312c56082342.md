That assumes that there is "profit" from exchanging currencies.  On any 
given transaction, there is never any "profit."  The only thing that might 
be called a profit is a difference in exchange rates, and that really isn't 
an increase in wealth at any point.   Ask that CPA to look it up.

This makes sense:  If the currency in my pocket becomes less valuable due to 
inflation, I cannot deduct the loss.  If it becomes MORE valuable due to 
deflation, I do not need to declare the difference as income.  Currency 
transactions only generate "profits" from a change in conversion rates, 
which are simply differences in inflation rate between two currencies.

The answer is, "They're not!"  That's right, you heard me.  It's uphill all 
the way for the IRS.
