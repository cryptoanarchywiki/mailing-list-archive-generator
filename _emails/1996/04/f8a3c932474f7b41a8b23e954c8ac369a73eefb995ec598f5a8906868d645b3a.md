This goes to show that export controls on encryption are going to have to 
go, Leahy bill or not.

I don't think they have any choice!  Washington is already bombarded with 
email within hours every time they do something stupid.

Some of whom might even be aware that they could easily lose their jobs as a 
consequence of what's happening now on the 'net.

I sure wish they'd hurry up on this legislation.  Hope it's not just 
vaporware...er... vaporbill, or whatever.

Gee, I thought the 1st amendment did that?  Are our freedoms dependant on a 
bill that hasn't yet been passed, and may not even yet exist?

I'm anxious to see how many self-proclaimed supporters of the Leahy bill are 
going to do the right thing and drop their support of it once the text of 
this Burns bill has been released.  (assuming the Burns bill turns out 
to be satisfactory, of course, and that it covers all the "good" parts that 
we wanted from Leahy as well as leaving out all the bad ones.)  

Though I was never happy about that "list of shame" idea,  one of the tests 
that would partially confirm or deny the proper placement of any given name 
on that list would be that the person named would shift his support to a 
repaired bill.  I can't see any logical reason to continue to support a 
flawed bill if and when a corrected bill appears.

Damn!  They keep leaving me out of their short list!  Maybe they meant to 
lump me in with the groups they mentioned.  I'm an American, so I can't be a 
"foreign spy," and my supply of child pornography is at a constant zero 
level.   I'd sure hate to be lumped into an ignominious position with the 
"other criminals," however:  What an unimpressive title!

Maybe I'll just have to settle for being called a terrorist. Harrumph!
