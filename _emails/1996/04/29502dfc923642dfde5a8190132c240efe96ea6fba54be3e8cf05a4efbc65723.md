Nope.

IDEA is in no way deprecated in SSL 3.0.  We were just trying to prune
the list of cipher suites to what we thought was useful.

The cipher suites specified in the SSL 3.0 protocol document are only
a beginning.  All cipher suites beginning with 0xFF are reserved for
experimental use.  As part of the IETF standards process, I'd like
to see an IANA registry set up for registering new cipher suites.
