= has the heaviest artillery." 

	just because you carry, like everyone else, carrying God's banners does not 
    mean God is on your side, or the side with the heaviest artillery.  God is on 
    the side of those who have faith and charity-- nothing else required.

	the heaviest artillery is nothing more than man's pride, not his humility; 
    pride will not bring you to the celestial kingdom, nor will you inherit the 
    earth.
