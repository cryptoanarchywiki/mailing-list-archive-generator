Hm. I didn't see that post... (I wonder if he plotted an ASCII

A lot of bad PRNGs look good with noise spheres.... but what I found 
while experimenting with them was data based on timer drift samplings 
that passed a variety of randomness tests but showed up with very 
clear patterns on a noise sphere... so I made the original post to 
the list and sci.crypt about it.

Noise spheres will show certain correlations in the data.  It doesn't 
mean that the RNG is crypto-usable if it looks good. But if it looks 
bad then you know to be suspicious.... a visual image makes a clear 
point better than analyzing a lot of numbers on a page.

By no means should it be relied upon as a sole test.

If you see definite spirals and loops then it's more than random 
noise.

It doesn't pass or reject anything. It plots data. If the data shows 
*definite* patterns, you can reject the RNG.  If not, use more 
sophisticated tests.

That's probably what the poster to c'punks wrote about...

*sigh*
