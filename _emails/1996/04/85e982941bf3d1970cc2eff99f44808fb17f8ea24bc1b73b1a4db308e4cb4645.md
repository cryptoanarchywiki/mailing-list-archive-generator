We use CERN proxies, as well as general purpose proxies,
 which effectivly narrows it down to someone within my company.

But, that only masks the IP address.  My impression was that
most browsers hand out enough info about you at the application
layer that it does little good to mask the IP address.  At least for
privacy purposes...address translation is a great firewall
model, IMHO.

Has anyone developed such a beast yet?

Will we have as extensive a WWW proxy network as remailer network?
