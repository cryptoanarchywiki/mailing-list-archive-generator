There has been research into developing chaos based encryption, but none of
the systems developed are nearly as strong as block ciphers such as IDEA and
3DES.  Chaos encryption is more like steganography than encryption.
The chaos encryption schemes that I know of use a driving circuit to generate
the carrier wave for the transmission.  If a person on the other end knows the
driving circuit used, then that person can remove it.  The output of a chaos
encryption mechanism is similar to static, but I don't think that it is
particularly strong.  With proven strong encryption, the only advantage I can
see to using chaos encryption would be to encrypt analog data.
