At the very least, he'd have to IDENTIFY himself at least to the extent that

As you quoted me above, you are aware that my point was that the SC-listed 
exceptions to the 5th amendment were recent and didn't have older US 
precedent.  I claimed that there was no logical reason to believe that such 
claimed exceptions were anything other than comparatively recent excuses 
given to allow violations of the 5th amendment.   While I am not totally 
disinterested in foreign examples, that was NOT the area under discussion. A 
foreign example is irrelevant because it does not challenge my claim. Notice 
that Unicorn has studiously avoided my original observation.
