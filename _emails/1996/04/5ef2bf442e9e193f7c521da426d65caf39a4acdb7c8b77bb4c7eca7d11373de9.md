A) Yes, all circuitry radiates to some extent. The variable is
the "some" factor. And is the noise compromising or just revealing?
[Does it allow the Opposition to know you are typing, or WHAT you
are typing...?] And the one everyone here seems to ignore -- can you
hear it from where you need to? [I know of one National Lab with a
blanket Tempest exemption -- it's a MILE to the uncontrolled border
area.]

B) Sure the Fort has Fab facilities. But Acme Gas & Grocery fixes
cars, yet they do NOT have the diagnostic computer for my [in my
dreams..] new BMW.

Preventium & leading edge chips requires MASSIVE amounts of
money for the infrastructure, and yesterday's versions do not cut
it. [Tim, got any real $$ here?] I suspect it's like monitors: 14"
SVGA's cost $200; 16" $650; 19" $1200 & 21", don't ask. Sure,
tomorrow the 16" is $500, but you need it TODAY.

The Fort is too busy trying to justify its FTE numbers to blow
a couple zillion on keeping current with fab stuff. Plus, in
a business with only a few customers, how does they keep the
stepper-supplier from wising up?

And when Mr. Bill introduces the 686, do you start all over?

C) Would the Fort *really* ask for & get the needed cooperation
while the industry fights CrippleChip/GAK?

D) There are far cheaper ways to attack, as others point it. Neuter
the power-supply controller chip, and it stays the same for
generations. Or go for the video RAMDAC.
