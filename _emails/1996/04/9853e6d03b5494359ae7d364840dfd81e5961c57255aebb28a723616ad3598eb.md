	Given that they didn't have a subpoena at this point, wouldn't the
simplest way to solve this problem be to wipe the records? Somehow, I suspect
that the judge is unlikely to put Caltech in contempt of court on suspicion
that they're lying about the records being wiped. Now, contempt of court out of
irritation...
