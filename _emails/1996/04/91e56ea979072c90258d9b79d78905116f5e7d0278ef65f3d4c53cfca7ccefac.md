Here you go (*all* the instructions you need)---

Welcome to the Clueless Users Network Test System, an intelligence test
for the ignorant and impolite.

You have been automatically added to this mailing list because you sent a
subscription request like "UNSUB ME" out to the entire readership of a
mailing list, instead of sending it to the list server or list
maintainer.

There is nobody of worth reading this mailing list.  The only way you
can
become unsubscribed is to figure out the standard way of unsubscribing
from an Internet mailing list.  Until that time, you will get these
messages regularly.

If you made an innocent mistake in sending your "UNSUB ME" out to the
entire list, then you will know how to unsubscribe from this list
immediately and no harm will be done.

If, on the other hand, you simply have no clue how to deal with mailing
lists, you'd better start reading up on the subject before you go
blundering around again.  Your attention is cordially drawn to the
newsgroups news.announce.newusers, news.newusers.questions, and
news.answers.

Final hint: the mailing list address is clueless@ucsd.edu

Have fun.

Per your request
	"subscribe clueless"
'foo@coelacanth.com' was ADDED to the 'clueless' mailing list.

To remove yourself from this list, send the command
	'unsub foo@coelacanth.com clueless'
to clueless-request@ucsd.edu or listserv@ucsd.edu.
Listserv problems requiring human intervention
should be addressed to clueless-relay@ucsd.edu.

You may subscribe or unsubscribe to any of the various campus mailing
lists and the local redistributions of global mailing lists by sending
email to "listserv@ucsd".  The commands understood by the listserver
program are:

HELP
	lists this file.  This is also sent whenever a message to
	listserv is received from which no valid command could be
	parsed.

HELP listname
	lists a brief description of the maillist requested.

INDEX
	lists all the maillists available for subscription.

LONGINDEX
	lists all the maillists and their descriptions.

ADD listname	 
DELETE listname	

ADD address listname	 
DELETE address listname	
	adds or deletes the given address to or from the list
	specified.  Mail is sent to the address given to confirm the
	add or delete operation.  For on-campus users, we strongly
	recommend that you use your campus registered mailname when
	subscribing (i.e., use the second form of the command which
	includes a specification of the address).  If you omit the
	'address', the command will assume the mailbox that is in the
	From:  line of the message.  Note that SUBSCRIBE is a synonym
	for ADD; UNSUBSCRIBE for DELETE.

DELETE-ALL
UNSUBSCRIBE-ALL

DELETE-ALL address
UNSUBSCRIBE-ALL address
	unsubscribes given address from all mailing lists. Mail is sent 
	the address given to confirm the deletions. If you omit 
	the 'address' the command will assume the mailbox that is in 
	the From: line of the message.

LIST
LIST address
	lists all mailing lists to which the given address is subscribed.
	If you omit the 'address' the command will assume the mailbox is
	in the from line. 

FAQ
FAQ listname
	sends a list of "Frequently Asked Questions" for the appropriate
	mailing list. The command "FAQ" by itself sends an index of 
	available FAQ's.

A command must be the first word on each line in the message.  Lines
which do not start with a command word are ignored.  If no commands were
found in the entire message, this help file will be returned to the
user.  A single message may contain multiple commands; a separate
response will be sent for each.

Please note that it IS possible to add or delete someone else's
subscription to a mailing list.  This facility is provided so that
subscribers may alter their own subscriptions from a new or different
computer account.  There is therefore some potential for abuse; we
have chosen to limit this by mailing a confirmation notification
of any addition or deletion to the address added or deleted including
a copy of the message which requested the operation.  At least you
can find out who's doing it to you.

Examples:

	add sunusers

	add ewombat foodlovers

	delete wombat@cyberpunk.ucsd.edu connectionists

	help eggbeaters

Note that although you would mail submissions to a campus mailing list by
addressing mail to e.g., sunusers@ucsd.edu. In a subscription request
you specify the name of the list simply (without the @ucsd part) as in 
the first example above.
