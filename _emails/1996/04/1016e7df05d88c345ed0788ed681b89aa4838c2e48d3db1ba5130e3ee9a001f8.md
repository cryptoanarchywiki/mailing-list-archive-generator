	*Sigh*.  Well, now I know voting for Bill The Cat wasn't a
mistake. :)

	Ah, Cobb County.  That would explain it.  That's Mr. Newt's 
stomping grounds, for y'all unfamiliar with Georgia.

	Can't prosecute those under existing fraud statutes if they're

	There was something about this on the local news.  The big
brouhaha was that the CPC page used the state seal "improperly".
Again, doesn't existing trademark law cover this?

	Gee, I wonder if my email address is sufficently vague that
