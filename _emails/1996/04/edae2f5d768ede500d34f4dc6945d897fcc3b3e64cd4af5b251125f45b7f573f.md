I don't see how this third scam would work in a system such as DigiCash
which uses online clearing.  Unissued serial numbers would be refused when
presented for clearing.

One scenario which would work (and could be used for scams 1 and 2) is
either stealing digital cash, or counterfeiting issued, but unredeemed
serial numbers.  In either case, if you spend it before the rightful owner
does, that rightful owner gets, as a minimum, a lot of hassle, and might
lose the cash.  If this kind of scam, particularly the counterfeiting scam,
occurs too often, public trust in the cash will disappear, and people will
refuse to buy it.

Note that people trying to maintain anonymity are particularly vulnerable
since they have to hold cash for a period of time to defeat traffic
analysis attacks.
