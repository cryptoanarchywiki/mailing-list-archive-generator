It doesn't matter too much who's mainly to blame--the result is the same.

And game-theory-wise, there is little incentive to quickly push the wager
to a well-defined final state. These "bets" are largely tail-feather
displays, anyway, so the posturing and weaseling serves the purpose of one
or more of the parties. Which is precisely why these bets take up so much
list bandwidth.

On the Extropians list, during the last few months I was on it, a huge
fraction of the list traffic was devoted to such arguments (along with
"pending court cases" involving one party filing charges against another,
searches for mediators, countersuits, judgments, arguments about
punishments, and on and on).

Frankly, I thought that Black Unicorn claimed to have seen the error of his
ways (in terms of debating with Bell) and was going to stop?
