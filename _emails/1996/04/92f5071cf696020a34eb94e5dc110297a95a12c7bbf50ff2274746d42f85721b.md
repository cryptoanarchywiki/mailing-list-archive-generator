Chase, Citi, MC and others are offering a stored value card on the west
side of Manhattan. They're saying that smart cards are faster than cash.
Stick the card in, say yes to the amount.  The terminals are wired directly
to a bank account, so we're looking at a book entry system, it looks
like...

The announcer is breathless at the possibilities....

I wonder if this is CAFE, Mondex, or what? anyone know?

Cheers,
