I agree with you to a point, Tim.  They probably haven't read the 
messages about how to properly unsubscrive.  Not because they are 
dweebs or because they think it's funny.  they probably haven't read 
the messages because they have 2 or 3 thousand messages in their 
inbox and they're all from cpunks.  Unfortunately, this time, I have 
to give them the benefit of the doubt for being ignorant.  I don't 
think they're being vindictive.

How many of them have posted Unsub messages after being told the 
proper way to unsub?

This may kill off the Cypherpunks list even where Detweiler's massive rants
failed. (Now that Detweiler's cabin in Montana has been raided, and one of
his tentacles carried off, who will fill his shoes? Vlad the VZNuri is well
on his way to matching Detweiler's volume, if not his obsessiveness.)
