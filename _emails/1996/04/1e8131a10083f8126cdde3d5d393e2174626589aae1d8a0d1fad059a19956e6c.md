	Speaking of attorneys, is there any way that an attorney can serve as
an anonymous mail forwarder? The user would give the attorney permission to
look at anything suspicious (e.g., mail from a credit card company) to make
sure no fraud, theft, et al were being committed. Would this be covered under
lawyer-client confidentiality in the US?

	Fascinating.

>This is nearly irresponsible reporting.

	Reporters nowdays are getting so overloaded that they're taking
information from whoever will talk to them. Look at what happened with the
chips-in-Iraqui printer story.
