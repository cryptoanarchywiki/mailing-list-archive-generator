Seriously - putting this sort of stuff at the IP layer is not doable; 
confidentiality and encryption, at least on a host-to-host basis is

application level.

Am I the only one to find it really wierd that the Unabomber had a

There is no middle way                  Which side are you on
You'll either be a Usenet man           Which side are you on boys
Or a thug for the CDA                   Which side are you on?
