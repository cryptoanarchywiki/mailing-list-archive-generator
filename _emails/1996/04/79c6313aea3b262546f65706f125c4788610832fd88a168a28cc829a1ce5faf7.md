Mkpgp does what you describe.  You can get it by sending mail to slutsky@
lipschitz.sfasu.edu with a subject of "mkpgp".  As for extracting keys from
finger info or a web page, you can just run pgp on a file containing the
user's homepage or .plan file.  On Unix, a command like "finger user@host.
domain | pgp -kaf" will work.  Basically a combination of fingering the user
and querying the key servers will work most of the time.
