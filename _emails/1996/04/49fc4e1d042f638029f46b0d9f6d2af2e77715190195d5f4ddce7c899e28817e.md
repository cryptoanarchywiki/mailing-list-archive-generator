It is traditional to commemorate big events with annual observances.  I
say there's no reason the observances can't predate the event when it is
known in advance.

So I propose that September 20 be known as Crypto Freedom Day, and an
annual celebration be held on that day.  With each year closer to 2000
the party gets bigger, culminating on the day that the patent actually
expires.  We can all run our RSA in three lines of Java that Adam Back
will have prepared, and taste for the first time the freedom which the
rest of the world will have known for the past 17 years.
