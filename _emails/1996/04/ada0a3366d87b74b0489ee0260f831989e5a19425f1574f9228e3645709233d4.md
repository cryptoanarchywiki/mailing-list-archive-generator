	I require a higher standard of proof for worse accusations. I consider
calling someone a racist a worse insult than calling them a liar. Furthermore,
that this is an FBI _informant_ is a strike against the person to begin with
in terms of trustworthiness.

	I don't approve of either separatists or supremacists; I just see the
former as not quite as evil as the latter. Calling Weaver a supremacist is
most common among the organizations that seem to believe that such actions as
at Ruby Ridge are just fine, so long as they are against their enemies; it
appears to be a public relations ploy (although the evidence is admittedly
uncertain). I don't call Weaver a hero, either, but the most evil ones at Ruby
Ridge were the governmental types.
