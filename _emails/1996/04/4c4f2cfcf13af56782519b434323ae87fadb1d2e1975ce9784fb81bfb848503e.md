As true as this may be, it doesn't explain the original posters problem;
unseeded IDEA should generate data that looks every bit as random as data
which was fully seeded (otherwise IDEA leaks information). This should
raise a question regarding the utility of any post-facto measurement of
entropy; the stream of bits generate by IDEA encrypting zero values in CBC
mode with a key of zero clearly has little, if any, entropy, but the data
generated should be indistinguishable from true random data by all
statistical and pattern-recognition tests. See the discussion on
coderpunks.

Basically, to get crypto-quality random numbers:
 1) Use a secure generator; any secure block cipher or hash function will do.
 2) Seed it well. This is entirely specific to your situation & platform,
and is unmeasurable for practical purposes.
