That was the entire point of my original posting on this subject.  I was
proposing using a compression function on spinner data, which contains very
little entropy and compresses well. (50 - 80% on idle loop timing data,
depending on processor load)  I don't believe I said anything about
compressing image data of any kind, or audio recordings of humpback whales
doing the wild thing, etc.  Noise sphere plots of ZIP files look pretty good,
regardless of how good or bad the plot of the unZIPed file looks.  (Raw idle
loop timing plots are terrible.)  I have posted a longer reply to Perry via
E-mail...
