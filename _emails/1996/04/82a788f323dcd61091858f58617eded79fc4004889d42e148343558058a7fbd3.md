The event costs $35 (or $20 if you're a Churchill Club member).  Probably
plus the price of dinner -- this wasn't clear from their recording.
I wish I would be in town for it.  Someone do a trip report, please!  -- gnu

Economic espionage is costing the nation billions of dollars in lost 
business every year.  U.S. companies are in danger of losing everything 
from trade secrets and proprietary financial information , to the bottom 
line figures on contract bills.  Three bills are now in Congress to 
protect government, business and home computer users from outside 
snooping of sensitive information.  These proposed new laws have been 
written to encourage the use of encryption and loosen export 
restrictions on encryption technology.  Congressman Goodlatte is the 
author of one of these bills.  April 1996 is also the 20th anniversary 
of the creation of Public Key Cryptography.  The three principal 
pioneers and patent holders will also be present to share their views on 
the need for strong encryption.  Morris of Cylink Corp. will provide an 
overview of what state-of-the-art security solutions are needed, and 
available, to truly protect business from unauthorized access.  James 
Freeman of the FBI will discuss the recent study on industrial espionage 
and Paul Raines from the U.S. Postal Service will talk about electronic 
postmarking and certificate authority key registry bureau.
