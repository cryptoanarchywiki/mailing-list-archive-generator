No, no.  What started this whole discussion was someone claiming that
bytes have ALWAYS been 8 bits.  That was the argument.  NO-ONE is
claiming that byte doesn't mean 8 bits NOW.  I think we have now
established that, yes, 'byte' is synonymous with 'octet' in the modern
computer era, and no, this was not always the case.  Now can we move on
to other matters?
