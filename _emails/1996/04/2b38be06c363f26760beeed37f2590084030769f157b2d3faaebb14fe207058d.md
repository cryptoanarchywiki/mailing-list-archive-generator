By now, you've probably seen my comment to Unicorn, that ISP's could easily 
pool their resources, in a form of insurance, to guarantee that any test 
case will be fully litigated to ensure that a bad precedent isn't set.  What 
if it cost a million dollars?  That's only about 5 cents per American 
Internet user.

You were saying about "going bankrupt"?
