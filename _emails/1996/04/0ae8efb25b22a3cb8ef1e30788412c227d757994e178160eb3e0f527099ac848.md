  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Is it possible that we are witnessing a self-fulfilling prophecy?
I believe that we are contributing to the gradual implementation of Jim's AP
system to deal with excessive noise posting (which makes AP to be The 
Assassination Posting) and unenforceable betting. It's interesting to note 
that this is the side-effect of Mr. Bell's own postings on the subject 
(congrats).

   I therefore bet 100 Monopoly Roubles that by the end of the "Unibell" 
dispute (sometime before all the stars freeze over) a contract on the 
original assassination politician's head(s) will have been successfully 
carried out. I also note that Mr. Unicorn, being wealthy and having wisely
protected his anonymity is in a fine position to carry this out. without 
any fear of retaliation or discovery. 

   What's more, during the "No matter where you go, there they are" thread, 
Jim sent a reply to Dr. Denning with the infamous cypherpunks@toad.com in 
the headers. Not smart. Alas, from now on, no matter where Jim goes, Dorothy 
will know. (Say, don't Uni and Denning both live around DC? Hmmm...)

   So I submit to the list that any reinvention of the AP is ultimately 
self-terminating. (Though it might reduce noise and deal with unsuscrivers)

The odds aren't good, Jim. You should have been more careful.

;-)

Watch out Declan, the frustrated gamblers on the list might take your 
statements as encouragement to Jim and decide to test out the prototype 
AP on you first. )8-0


Be careful folks, Little Dorothy is watching You!


Ps. As this pseudonym will disappear before September, I am quite safe, 
myself.
