The more the irrational and indefensible the faith, the more that the
proponents of that faith view any sort of debunking attempt as "an attack".
(It is not just Scientologists that suffer from this mentality.  I have seen
those of the more fanatical Christian varieties make the same claim.)

What these schemes will do is shield children from anything resembling a
"controversial" discussion.  (I expect Cypherpunks to be labeled as "could
cause criminal behaviour" or some such malarky by the more protective and
clueless.  (It may be true, but why warn them upfront? ]:> ))  You will see
the forces of "good" try and protect the little kidlets from anything that
might get them to think for themselves.  It is already happening in some
sectors of public thought, I expect the net to become its next victim.

Soon everything will be "Sanitized for your Protection".
