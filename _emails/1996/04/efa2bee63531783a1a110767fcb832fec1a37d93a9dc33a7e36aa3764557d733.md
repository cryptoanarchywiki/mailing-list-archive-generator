Here's a question, however:  What, exactly, stands between the way it is 
supposedly done, today, and wiretapping with none of these "protections."  I 
see nothing in the Constitution which mandates them, at least explicitly, 
which suggests that the thugs might simply decide, tomorrow, that they are 
not really necessary after all.  Is it possible that the only reason these 
protections are in place is to provide a window-dressing of caution, to 
ensure that the disgust of the public doesn't get too great?

And another question I've never seen a satisfactory answer for:  Why is 
there not an automatic policy to inform the person tapped, at least after 
the tap is removed, analogous to the level of information the victim of a 
search warrant normally gets?
