This may be a bit of a no brainer, but everything I have read sorta 
skips over this point.

a bit is 1 or 0
8 bits make up a byte (0-255)
If I have a 5 byte key, does that make it a 40 bit key?  The only
reason this doesn't make sense to me is it seems useless to use 5 byte
keys, yet that is what companies export since the government limits keys
to 40 bits.
