I have read that GPS uses encryption to place time-dependent, 
location-dependent inaccuracies into the signals.  Innacuracies 
small enough so they are not a problem for civilian navigation, 
(mostly) but large enough to prevent GPS from being a useful method 
of military targeting for anyone who does not hold the keys.

Perhaps Ms. Denning is suggesting that the US feral government could 
act as a "trusted server" (and she has repeatedly suggested such trust) 
and tell us whether a GPS that "thinks" it's at some location, right now, 
is REALLY at some known location.
