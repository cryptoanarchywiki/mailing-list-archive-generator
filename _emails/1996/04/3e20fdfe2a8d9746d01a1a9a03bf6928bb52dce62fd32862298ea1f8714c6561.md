Yep, NYT has a story on it today, the testrun is in my own 
pigsty.


It's by Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Mastercard and Visa: 
electronic cash loaded on a plastic card that can be used to 
make small purchases.


The article also reviews the state of the art.


Wanna see it from me, or try http://www.nytimes.com?
