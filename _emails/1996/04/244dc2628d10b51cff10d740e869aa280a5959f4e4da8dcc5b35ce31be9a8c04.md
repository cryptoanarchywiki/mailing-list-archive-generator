The export language comes from the origional Cantwell bill and orders the
Commerce Sec. to allow export of mass market software and allows somewhat more
limited export of non-mass market software dependng on what is available to
banks in that country. Its not ideal (I think the limits on non-mass market
should be the same as mass market- almost none except for a limited number of
"terrorist" countries (we'd get killed if we argue that those should be
eliminated) but overall much better than leahy's and somewhat better than
goodlatte's bill.

Myself also, I suppose.  That's why I'm so concerned that it not contain any 
component that could be easily be re-written more to our liking.  The big 
attraction of the Burns bill, from a strategic standpoint, is that (by the 
elimination of export controls, assuming it does it) it removes the one 
major "must do" task onto which could be loaded other "features" that we 
can't stand, as the Leahy bill tried to do.  Once export controls are 
eliminated on crypto, it should become impossible to get enough support to 
pass a bill even mentioning key escrow, let alone mandating it.
