I understand that calling C libs from Java is possible, but the details how
to go about that are still hazy to me. It is also unclear if Sun will
support this dual coding as a general capability that can be used by all
Java apps (don't think of Java just as downloadable applets) or require
that all modules, to give an example, for a certain soon to be very
relevant Java application to be written in 100% Java.

Presumably, such packages would have to be signed by Sun. Needless to say,
these certificates would cost money. A potentially lucrative source of
revenue for Sun. Nothing wrong with that.
