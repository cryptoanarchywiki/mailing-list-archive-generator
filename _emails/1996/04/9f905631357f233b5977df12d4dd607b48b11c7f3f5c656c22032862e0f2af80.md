	Another method would be for ecash to have a label on it as to when the
issuer would redeem it. Until then, if you want cash from it, find someone else
to trade to. This has the interest advantage for the purchaser, and the
advantage to the issuer that they won't have to worry about when someone will
redeem it. They'll know that they'll need to have a particular amount on a
particular date, and their earnings/losses up until that point can vary all
over the place without being worried about whether they can make their
payments. Ideal for a startup business.
