Those who don't remember Unix are condemned to re-invent it :-)
There have been _lots_ of papers done on the topic, and lots of
programs written; there's probably a good chunk of material in Knuth as well.
How quick is "quickly"?  How big is your dictionary?

"grep" is probably not the right model, since you have the opportunity
to pre-sort your dictionary.  "look" does a binary search on sorted text, 
which can be very fast for general applications; you can go faster if
you want to play with indexing and hashes, using lots of programs like dbm.

If you're looking up a bunch of words at a time, you probably win by
looking up an index table before looking in the dictionary itself,
since it'll be in cache or in your program for all but the first look.
If your dictionary is under 1MB, the useful parts of it may stick around
in cache long enough to avoid multiple disk reads, especially if
you're able to pre-sort the words you're searching against as well.
On the other hand, if it's 100MB, and you're using a large machine,
it's worth using maybe 100-1000KB of hash table to speed up lookups.

Somebody mentioned the use of a bitmapped hash-table to get a quick check
on whether an entry is probably there; there was a paper in Usenix's journal
about 5 years ago on this by one of the Bell Labs Research folks,
probably Doug McIlroy or Peter Weinberger, in the context of a spelling
checker.  If the hashes aren't expensive to compute, and you get a 
small percentage of false hits, it's cheap to look them up in the real
dictionary.
