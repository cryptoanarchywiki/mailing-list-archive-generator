Hello. I've been off the list for quite a while now, so I'm not up to 
date on the current ecash schemes. My company (a major internet service 
provider with a lot of web advertising clients) is looking into which 
digital cash method would be best to support for use on our customer's 
web pages. The head of the web department has taken a look at several, 
and is torn between Mark Twain's stuff and Cybercash. I was wondering if 
people who have looked at these systems could give me a rundown on the 
major differences. I know that Mark Twain is nice and secure (or at least 
I *think* I know that) but Cybercash is signifigantly easier to use. Any 
comments would be welcome, and to keep list volume down (I assume it's 
still as busy as ever) I'd be happy to recieve replies via direct email, 
and sumarize for the list.

Happy Hunting, -Chris Odhner
