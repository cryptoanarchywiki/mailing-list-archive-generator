It is one thing to believe that you might be able to change a human's mind
by threatening another human via jail.  (It reminds me of many bad movies.)
 It is quite a different level of hubris to think that a similar action
could overcome mathematical probability.  However, I am unable to predict
the actions of anyone who believes that the Supreme Court is the top
law-giver of the Universe.
