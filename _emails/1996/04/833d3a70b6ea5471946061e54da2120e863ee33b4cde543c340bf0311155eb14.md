Perhaps keyspace analysis and randomness analysis should be done from a 
Bayesian technique, with the the potential perspective of the cracker, or 
your estimate of the potental prospective of the cracker as a priori 
conditions.

Hamlet could well qualify as a random string, however if your cracker was 
using 'Great Books of Western Civ' as a dictionary source, it would not 
be so good.
