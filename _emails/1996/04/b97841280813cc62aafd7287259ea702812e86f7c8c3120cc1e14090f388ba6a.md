	Currently, yes... but the divide between rich and poor is growing.
(So long as this divide is determined by merit, and the poor still have enough
to survive, I'd call this a good trend. So would various other people on this
list, perhaps without my caveats.) In other words, the middle class is going
up or down. The factory workers are going down; the high-ability workers
(including information workers) are going up. So just talking about the rich
makes sense.
