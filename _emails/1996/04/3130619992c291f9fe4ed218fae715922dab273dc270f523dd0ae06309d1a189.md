Trivial.

Publish a book -> Ten years.
Sell a book -> Ten years.
Sell CDROM -> Ten years.
Publish on the net (at this time US only, but identical campaigns are
underway in just about any country with a decent net connection) -> Ten
years.

Won't stop the hard core terrorist, but will keep the general population
from taking action once they finally realize what is going on.
