I didn't respond to this part originally because I grew tired of typing
"Yadda yadda yadda" everytime Mr. Bell lapsed into another
psycho-political babble session.

What this has to do with Mr. Bell's  position, that citizens as a whole had 
grown so discontented in the United States that they were prepared to rebell 
actively in large numbers, is unclear.  In fact the Spooner quote adds 
more to my position than Mr. Bell's:

"if allowed the ballot, would use it, if they could see any chance of 
thereby meliorating their condition."  

Seems that even according to Spooner, the citizens of the U.S. aren't 
hopeless yet.

In fact there is ample evidence that citizens who have come to believe 
that a sovereign is beyond redemption refuse to participate in the 
political process any longer.  Iran, Iraq, the former Soviet Union, 
Turkey, the Baltic States are all examples.
