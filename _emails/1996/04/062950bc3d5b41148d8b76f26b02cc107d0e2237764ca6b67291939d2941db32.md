This is a note I came across in my archives hinting at how anti-porn
groups used the content of the alt.sex.* groups to pass the CDA, and how
they may not exactly be a fan of anonymous remailers.

Attached is a memo from Deen Kaplan, previously a vice president at the
then-named National Coalition Against Pornography, to other anti-porn
activists. Note that John McMickle soon afterwards became a member of
Sen. Chuck Grassley's staff and helped recruit witnesses for the July
1995 cyberporn hearings. (You may recall that Grassley was pushing for a
law even worse than the CDA.)

Some of the names on the To: line are easy to identify, like Rice-Hughes
and Jepsen from Enough is Enough! And Cathy Cleaver from the Family
Research Council, whom I'm debating in a few weeks. The others I haven't
figured out yet.

(The FRC is run by Gary Bauer, a former policy assistant to Reagan and a
former undersecretary at the Department of Education. Now Bauer heads
the FRC, the DC-based lobbying extension of James Dobson's Focus on the
Family." Dobson's history includes serving on the Attorney General's
Commission on Pornography, aka the Meese Commission. Bauer also embraced
Marty Rimm's cyberporn study as gospel, calling the ACLU and EFF "porn
industry apologists" who are "taking cheap shots at this comprehensive
study.")

I'm passing this along as an FYI.

 Here's an anonymous message posted last night on the Usenet Board
 Alt.sex.pedophilia. REALLY sick and a good example (even if the person is
 kidding, which is unlikely in this area.). I'll do a demo of how the
 USENET boards work in the office for D.C. people after Thanksgiving.

 Those orphan kids in the terminally ill section of the hospital are so fun
 at night when they are drugged out. I love sucking on their tiny
 finger-sized cocks and probing their tight holes. Their slender little
 bodies are completely smooth. They're going to die pretty soon so they
 won't come back to me several years from now as hairy grown up men blaming
 me for why they are all mentally messed up. And since they are orphans
 with no one to look over them except for overworked staff, I could get
 away with just about anything.
