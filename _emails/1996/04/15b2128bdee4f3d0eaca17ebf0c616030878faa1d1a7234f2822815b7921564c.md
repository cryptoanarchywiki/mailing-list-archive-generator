Does anybody know how well these systems work? If I don't shave over the
weekend will my computer know who I am Monday morning? Is my credit card
going to have my face digitized and encoded onto the mag stipe for
comparision with a video camera image at the time of sale?

I think many eyewitness accounts are already taken with a grain of salt, at
least as far as picking a suspect. Certainly in court the lawyers say
whatever makes their case look better.

Most if not all credit card issuing banks use some form of fraud detection
software. The next generation of these products will be analyzing
transaction data from the card clearing banks in real time to stop
fraudulent transactions before they are complete. Expect to see more "may I
see your ID" questions as these systems flag transactions as possible fraud.
I have had a credit card with my photo on it for several years, I can't ever
remember a sales person who seemed at all interested in comparing the photo
to me.
