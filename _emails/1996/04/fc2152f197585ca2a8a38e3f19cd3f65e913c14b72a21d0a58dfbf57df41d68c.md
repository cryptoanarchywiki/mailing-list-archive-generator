I have to apologize for this.  Me having a bad day is not a good reason to
call Jeff Barber an idiot.  My aplogies.

Again, I probably went a little overboard.  I just get worried when any one
company has as much control over the technology (in this case net based
encryption) as netscape has.  That, and I used to work for one of their
competitors and I get tired of people telling me that netscape is the only
company out there.  

Sorry to be a jerk
