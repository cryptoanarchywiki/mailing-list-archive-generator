Woah, nice transition.  "That position" suddenly becomes "my position."  
Tell me, what is my position?  I never expressed an opinion.

The above is the argument of the court, not my argument.  I never 
expressed an opinion on the argument.

What was my position again?

My justifications?  Where?

I'm making none here.

Because English is my third (or fourth depending on how you count them) 
language and I don't bother with spell checkers?  How well do you spell in 
German, Alemanish or Estonian?

As always, I never expressed opinions on the courts view.  You asked for 
justifications, I gave you the court's.  I've not commented on my own 
view.
