Interest-bearing accounts cannot legally be anonymous--the IRS requires
records of interest payments for tax purposes.  Even if the e$ issuer is
collecting interest on my ecash, I don't care as long as they don't charge me
any fees,.  As far as I am concerned, if the issuer can make anonymous e$
worth his while to issue, the loss in potential interest income is more than
outweighed by the advantages of being able to use such a system.
