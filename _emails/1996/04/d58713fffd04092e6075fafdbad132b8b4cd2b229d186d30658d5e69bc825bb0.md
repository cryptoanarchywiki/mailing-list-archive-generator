Whoa. Thanks for mentioning my article, Declan, but I think "colluded" is
too strong here - as far as I know, Livingston never contacted Exon, even
though Livingston's ChoiceNet can undoubtedly play into his hands.

Almost - Bruce Taylor is, actually, but he's not part of Exon's satff.


The only problem is that, like many such

It should be noted that Livingston is promoting this as a voluntary
solution a la PICS. PICS' own Web pages, after all, suggest software on
routers could do the job as well as client products like NetNanny,
CyberPatrol, etc. There are some distinct advantages to doing it that way,
in fact.

Livingston insists this is an alternative to mandatory censorship, but
they're not being shy about admitting it can be used in other ways, too.
All that said, you cypherpunks can speculate who's up to what in all this.
