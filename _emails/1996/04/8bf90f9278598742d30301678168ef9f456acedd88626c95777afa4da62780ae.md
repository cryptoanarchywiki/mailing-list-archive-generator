Neither, for that matter, do IPv6 packets -- there is no provision for
them. Furthermore, were anyone to create an end to end header of that
sort, it would be eight bytes of wasted space in every packet in the
net, especially since the implementation of such a tag is a technical
impossibility as there is no way to force the originating system to
tell the truth.

The internet and the culture are coming into conflict in a big way,
and I don't believe that both of them can survive.
