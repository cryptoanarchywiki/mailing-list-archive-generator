No, the report was right: the weak keys are real.

For one key in 256, you have a 13.6% chance of recovering 16 bits of
the original key.

On average, the work factor per key recovered is reduced by a factor
of 35 (i.e. the effective keylength is reduced by 5.1 bits) by using
this class of weak keys.
	- quoting from the report

I've experimentally confirmed this effect myself.  Andrew Roos did
some good work.

Take care,
