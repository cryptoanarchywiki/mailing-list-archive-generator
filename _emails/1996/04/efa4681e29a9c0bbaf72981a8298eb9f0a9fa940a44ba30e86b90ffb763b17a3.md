Some "limited edition"!  The first edition of Leonard C. Lewin's
delightful and insightful satire was a trade hardcover widely
distributed by The Dial Press in 1967 that has remained in print ever
since.

That elements of the lunatic fringe of the American right take this book
on face value, as the suppressed report of a secret think-tank, would
make veteran trollers like James "Kibo" Parry gulp with envy.

Why stop here?  There is a document ("Protocols") that PROVE that the
world is secretly run by a conspiracy of Jewish elders.  (The rumors
that this document was a fabrication by the Czarist Russian secret
police are obviously the handiwork of that same conspiracy.)

YHBT.  HAND.(*)
