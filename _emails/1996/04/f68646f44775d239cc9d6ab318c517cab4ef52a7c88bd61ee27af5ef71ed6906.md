     It was not ready to use against the USSR/Russia (as should probably be
evident from current nationalist movements in the non-Russian portions of the
USSR, Russia tended to dominate that union) before the USSR was an ally of the
United States. (I refer you to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact between the USSR and
Nazi Germany.) After the war, they were still tied by various agreements; by
the time that it became obvious that Russia had broken those agreements, it
had nuclear weapons and an attack would have been suicidal.
