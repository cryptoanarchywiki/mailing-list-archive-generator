Just the next logical extension of removing professional licenses for 
failure to comply with government edicts, removing driving licenses for 
failure to pay government imposed fines.

See Reich, "The New Property" and "The New Property after 25 Years"  
(Harvard Law Review I believe).  He suggests constitutional protections 
for these and other entitlements (like welfare), including due process.  
An entitlement to entitlements so to speak.  I believe that the better 
solution is to protect the rights ex ante (anonymous drivers/age and 
entitlement credentials) rather than ex post through the constitution 
but he has a very interesting survey of the various largess that 
government withholds to get its way.
