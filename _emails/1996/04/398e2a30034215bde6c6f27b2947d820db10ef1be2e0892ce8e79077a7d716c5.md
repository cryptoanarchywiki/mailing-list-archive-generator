I think Java is an excellent language to learn as a part of learning modern
programming languages and techniques.  Even if the bytecode verifier falls
completely on its face, you will still know a safer language than C or C++.
 (However, if the verifier falls, you may also know an obsolete language.)

The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, which may help you learn those
languages (in the same way knowing Italian helps you learn Spanish).  The
garbage collected nature of Java may get you into bad habits when using C
or C++, but since I switch back between Assembler and Java, it is not
insurmountable.

I do not think the Java bugs are bad enough to make it a poor language for
learning.  However, it is a very young language, and "nice" programming
environments aren't quite here yet.  However, new environments are being
delivered every month, so if you demand luxury environments, you shouldn't
have to wait too long.
