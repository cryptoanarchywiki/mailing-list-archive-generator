I'm glad to see that Keith Glass has taken the helm of the Electronic 
Freedom March.

Moving the date back to late September is a good idea:

* We can hold the March before Congress adjourns in early October.
* The date is close to the November elections.
* The Supreme Court will return on October 7 and will, I hope, decide
  to hear our lawsuit challenging the CDA soon after.

Now we have time to organize...

Changes to the Electronic Freedom March

The Electronic Freedom March on Washington, currently scheduled for June 
30th, 1996, has been re-scheduled to the fall, tentatively the weekend of 
28-29 September.

With the current state of the case against the CDA, ACLU vs. Reno, and 
several organizational factors, it's been concluded that it would be far more 
effective to focus the political power of the citizens of the Net closer to 
the November elections.  

We are currently looking for people to assist us in organizing and sustaining 
the Electronic Freedom March on Washington.  Specifically, we need assistance 
in fundraising and publicity, assistance in obtaining corporate and 
non-profit sponsorships, people familiar with stage and sound systems, crowd 
logistics, first aid, and security.  

Please refer all inquiries to Keith A. Glass, 703-354-1737, salgak@dcez.com
