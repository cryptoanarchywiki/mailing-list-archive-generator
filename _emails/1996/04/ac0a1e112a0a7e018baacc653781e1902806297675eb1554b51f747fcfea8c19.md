If you're interested in seeing the preliminary API for the next 
NOISE.SYS release, send a  message with the subject "send noise-api" 
and my mail filter will respond in kind.

Thoughful comments and criticisms or suggestions would be most 
welcome.

If you're seriously interested in taking a look at the source code 
before the next version is released (that is, if you intend to comb 
it for bugs, optimizations, security flaws, etc. etc.) drop me a 
line.


Rob.
