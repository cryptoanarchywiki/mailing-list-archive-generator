Here's the problem with this kind of counter-example:  You do not explain 
whether or not these data structures were actually called "bytes" by the 
manufacturer, or whether the term "byte" was inflicted later on by people 
who didn't know better.  Remember, in the absence of any name for a "6-bit 
data object" I'm sure the temptation was probably very strong to misuse a 
term, especially in hindsight.

See, I do not challenge the fact that there were plenty of data objects of 
length other than 8-bits.  The issue is whether or not the people back then 
actually believed that a correct, official usage of the term "byte" included 
lengths other than 8.

Dmitri Vulis at least acknowledged that when he looked back into the 
documentation, he discovered that the term used for his counter-example was 
"character", not byte.  How many other of these counter-examples would show 
this kind of thing?
