> 1:  A coin is almost twice the size of a coin in the RSA protocol

Nah, it can be the same size as in the RSA-based Digicash protocol.
(Pick x to be 128 bits, and repeatedly iterate SHA to get a 1024
bit y value, like Digicash does in their RSA-based Chaumian protocol.)

So your comment makes me glad I posted the scheme (even if it turns
out to be only of academic interest :-).

I claim that statement 2 is also true of Digicash's protocol as well.

Recall that Digicash is using an *online clearing* protocol-- so you
can't tell whether a coin is valid without consulting the bank.
Consulting the bank is absolutely necessary to prevent double spending.

So if you ever wrote an application which made a security-critical
decision based on whether the RSA signature verified correctly in the
Digicash protocol, and you didn't consult the bank re: double spending,
you'd be 100% vulnerable to a simple double spending attack.

In particular, I claim that the only reason the bank needs to publish
its RSA public exponent e is to allow you to blind the RSA signature:
it's specifically *not* intended for you to verify coin validity.

Everyone, feel free to jump in correct me if you disagree.

Well, if that's what you want, no currently shipping protocol gives
you that.  The current Digicash protocol does *not* let you do offline
clearing.

I don't claim to be able to solve the offline clearing problem; I just
hoped to point out that there is/(seems to be) nothing special about RSA.
(Indeed, one researcher has kindly emailed me to point out that several
well-known digital cash schemes use a El Gamal-based protocol.)
