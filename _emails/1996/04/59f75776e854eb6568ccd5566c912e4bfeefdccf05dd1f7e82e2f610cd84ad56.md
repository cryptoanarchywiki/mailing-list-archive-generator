No, it is a classic lawyer's attitude.  "If you do this, these are the 
risks."

I would have indicated that "you're going to face the prospect of 
intellectual property litigation, and that can get nasty in the extreme."

A combination of politics and law and timing.  If you're asking me to be 
a fortune teller, as so many people ask lawyers to do, you're asking too 
much.

This in itself I have never had a problem with.  I have called for as 
much myself many times.

Notice that there are no checks in my mailbox from Mr. Bell.

Provided you could get "most" ISP's to sign on, provided that the 
insurance provided for the very expensive proposition of seizure of ISP 
equipment, and provided that this be the first insurance entity ever with 
a stated policy of paying off policyholder for criminal sanctions which were 
directly the result of overt illegal acts by the policyholder.

I'm not saying it's impossible.  Well, I'm almost saying it's impossible.
