Assuming you have obtained the address database, it seems to me that this
scheme is subject to known address attacks:

(1) If you want to find out what newbie@slowresponse.com's anon ID is, you
just look it up.

(2) If you want to find out the real email addresses of all the users, you
test all the anon-ids with the reverse lookup table.  This attack could be
defeated by using sufficiently long random anon-ids.  If we assume 5 bits
of information/character, a 96 bit anon-id (sufficient to preclude
exhaustive search attacks) would require 19 character anon-ids.
