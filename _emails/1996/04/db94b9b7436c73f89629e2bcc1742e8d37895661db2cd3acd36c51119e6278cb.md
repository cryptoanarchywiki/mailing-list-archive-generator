Seignorage is neither of these things. It is the difference between
the cost of producing a currency token (like a quarter or a dollar
bill) and the face value of the token. In essense, its the profit
margin on printing or minting money.

Oh, really? From whom? First I've heard of this.

Now, it is indeed true that the Fed holds large numbers of government
bonds and theoretically earns interest on them, and that banks in a
free banking system do indeed loan out the money that backs their
notes. However, the fed has no mechanism to earn interest on dollar
bills, nor, in fact, does it need to.
