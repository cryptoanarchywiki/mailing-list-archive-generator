I of course was being careful to specifically say "the proposed law making
the writing of virus code a crime."

I think most of us will agree that destroying someone else's data via
viruses may well be a crime, depending on circumstances.

However, the talk of trying to felonize the _writing_ of virus code,
irrespective of whether it is ever used criminally, is what I think the
Bernstein decision bears on.
