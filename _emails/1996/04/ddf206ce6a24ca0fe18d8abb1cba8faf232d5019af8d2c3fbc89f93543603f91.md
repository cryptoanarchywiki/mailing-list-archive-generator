	Actually, people would also have a motivation to turn in false results
if they were being paid (perhaps in ecash) for their computer time. If they
could take less time and turn in a supposedly correct job, they would be
able to be paid the same amount for less work. Fortunately, it does appear
possible to filter out bad ones. In creating such a paid system, keeping this
possibility in mind would be needed.
