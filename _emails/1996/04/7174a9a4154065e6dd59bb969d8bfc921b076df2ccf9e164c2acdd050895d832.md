So what if WORST case:

So,  everyone starts using this system.  Especially the banks and exchanges.
And nothing goes wrong for a long time and we really start to rely on it.

What happens when one of the satellite gets hit by a meteor?  Telephone systems
can be re-routed.  Does the authentication system break down?  What if more
than one gets hit?  The earth passes close to the asteroid belt every so
often.  Thats why you can see shooting stars more often at certain times of
the year.

What if some country wanted to test out their new missile that knocks out
satellites and takes a shot at some of the GPS.  Obviously an act of war but
could they shutdown the world bank? So far we use satellites to route
information originating on terra ferma.  This would mean relying on data
originating from the satellite net to do business.  And more so relying on
data from more than one to come up with a computed value.

Have we never lost a satellite to a rock?  It doesn't even have to be a big
rock.  Just one moving at 100,000 mph.

What happens during solar flare storms.  Does the signal still make it
through?

Would the world buy into relying on a satellite system controlled by the USA?

The possibilities for new 007 episodes just multiplied.
