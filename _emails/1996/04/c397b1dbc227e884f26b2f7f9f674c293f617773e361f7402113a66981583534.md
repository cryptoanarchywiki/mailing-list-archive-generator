Maybe true in theory, under special circumstances, but not something of
immediate importance. Finding bugs is important, but no modern processor
chip set (including the peripheral chips) is likely to be "100% secure,"
whatever that means. (The NSA and its minions put out the "Rainbow Books"
to define this, and few machines come close to the top rating...)

There was a British plan some years back to develop a "provably secure"
microprocessor for life-critical applications, e.g. train controllers. It
was called "Viper." Last I heard, the project was not progressing.

It seems that most people would rather use the hundreds of MIPS of
processing power of a modern, high-density processor that the sub-MIPS
power of a Viper-type chip.

(I'm not of course saying that processing power and security are inverses
of each other, only noting that they haven't gone together so far.)

The most famed chip flaw of all time had no security implications, nor
would it ever have affected a single life. (Except stock market lives.) I'm
glad Intel offered a recall and fixed the bug, but the plain fact is that
the bug truly was obscure and could only be demonstrated under contrived
conditions.
