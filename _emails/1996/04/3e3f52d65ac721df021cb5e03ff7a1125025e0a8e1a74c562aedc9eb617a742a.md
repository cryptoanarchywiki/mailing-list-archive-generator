Roiters, 4/17/96:

Clinton worried books may help arm terrorists

TOKYO, April 17 (Roiter) - U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Wednesday he
was worried that books are aiding international terrorism by making it too
easy for sinister forces to learn how to make bombs or produce nerve gas.

"Are people learning, for example, from reading how to make the same
sort of trouble in the United States that was made in Japan with sarin gas?"
Clinton said at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto in Tokyo.

"Isn't it a concern that anybody, anywhere in the world, can find books and
encyclopedia articles about how to build a bomb like the bomb that
blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City?" he added.

Clinton said Japan and the United States, both victims of home-grown
terrorism last year, should learn from each other about how to deal with the
dangerous issue of unauthorized reading.

>From Tokyo, President Clinton is to fly to North Korea to discuss North
Korea's successful campaign to limit access to books and reading.
