If you are involved with the affairs of a large organization, I urge you
to check www.whoswhere.com to see if they have a bunch of user email
addresses that they shouldn't.

Of course there is little that one can do about this kind of invasion of
privacy. But they don't have to be so fucking blatant and stupid about it.
They have the email addresses of DAEMONS from our password files in their
database.

There is no need for mailbombing, or anything like that. Our lawyers are
simply going to nuke them from orbit. Please check them out before they go
offline, so that you will have a shot at whatever is left.
