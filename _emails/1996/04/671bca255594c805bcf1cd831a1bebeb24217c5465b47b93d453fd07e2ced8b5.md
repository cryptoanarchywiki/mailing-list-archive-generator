Why not create a list of of syllables (256 would work nicely) designed in
such a way that when combined together at random, they would always form a
pronounceable (but otherwise nonsense) word pair?  These words would be
guaranteed to be as unique as the fingerprint, fairly easy to remember, and a
perfect icebreaker at parties.  (Imagine the reaction you would get if you
sidled up to someone and tried "SOBgoFALpinHOGmiDOwop
PORtudeINfoGLOPsabRIvar" as a pickup line.)  The challenge to this approach,
of course, is to come up with 256 reasonably distinct syllables.

P.P.S.  These "unsubrscive" pea-brains all need one of those Louis

letters...
