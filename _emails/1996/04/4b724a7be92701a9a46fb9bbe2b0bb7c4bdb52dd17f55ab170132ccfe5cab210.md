Concurrent Resolution 

Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That 
the Secretary of the Senate, in the enrollment of the bill (S. 735) 
shall make the following corrections:

...

`(g) LIMITATION ON DISCOVERY-

        `(1) IN GENERAL- (A) Subject to paragraph (2), if an action
        is filed that would otherwise be barred by section 1604, but
        for subsection (a)(7), the court, upon request of the
        Attorney General, shall stay any request, demand, or order
        for discovery on the United States that the Attorney General
        certifies would significantly interfere with a criminal
        investigation or prosecution, or a national security
        operation, related to the incident that gave rise to the
        cause of action, until such time as the Attorney General
        advises the court that such request, demand, or order will
        no longer so interfere.

        `(B) A stay under this paragraph shall be in effect during
        the 12-month period beginning on the date on which the court
        issues the order to stay discovery. The court shall renew
        the order to stay discovery for additional 12-month periods
        upon motion by the United States if the Attorney General
        certifies that discovery would significantly interfere with
        a criminal investigation or prosecution, or a national
        security operation, related to the incident that gave rise
        to the cause of action.

        `(2) SUNSET- (A) Subject to subparagraph (B), no stay shall
        be granted or continued in effect under paragraph (1) after
        the date that is 10 years after the date on which the
        incident that gave rise to the cause of action occurred.

        `(B) After the period referred to in subparagraph (A), the
        court, upon request of the Attorney General, may stay any
        request, demand, or order for discovery on the United States
        that the court finds a substantial likelihood would--

        `(i) create a serious threat of death or serious bodily
        injury to any person;

        `(ii) adversely affect the ability of the United States to
        work in cooperation with foreign and international law
        enforcement agencies in investigating violations of United
        States law; or

        `(iii) obstruct the criminal case related to the incident
        that gave rise to the cause of action or undermine the
        potential for a conviction in such case.
