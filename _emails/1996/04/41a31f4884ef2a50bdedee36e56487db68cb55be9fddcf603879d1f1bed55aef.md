I believe Rich Loomis was referring to the fact that this is cypherpunks
not holocaust punks.

You continually bring up this irrelevant topic whenever someone complains
about your egregious statism on other issues:  

We are sick to the back teeth with hearing what a good guy you have been
on Nazism and the holocaust.  We do not give a shit.  We gave a
shit the first time, but we are up to about the hundredth time
and counting.
