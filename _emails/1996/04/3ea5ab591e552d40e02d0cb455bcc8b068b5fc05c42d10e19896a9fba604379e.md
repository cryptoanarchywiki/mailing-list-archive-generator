Agreed!  I wasn't "invited".  I simply requested access and
was quickly welcomed to the list.

TC May was not the first person to substantialy digress from
chartered topics but he certainly "ran with the ball" when he
got his chance to expose his ignorance and intolerance of
other races and religions ( the cypher-relevance or "charter
topicality of which always escaped me).  I was discouraged
by the encouragement given to the murder advocating moron,
Jim Bell to post his insance littany.

Well put, Perry!
