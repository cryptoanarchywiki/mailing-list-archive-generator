	My information would appear to be out of date; I was getting it from
one of the web-of-trust studies which stated that your new key was not
signed by anything except itself. Sorry.

	It would admittedly help if your messages were signed also; this would
provide somewhat of an additional confirmation. However, I very well understand
that this is not always possible/practical; note that I don't have a key yet.
