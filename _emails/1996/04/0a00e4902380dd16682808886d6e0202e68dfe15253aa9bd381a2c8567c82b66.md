	The first book about graphology was written in 1622 by
	C Baldi.  The first book on questioned document examination
	was written in the 1860s.   

	The first forensic use of graphology may have occurred as early 
	as 1960.  In 1975, a Juvenile Court Judge in Boulder CO used
	graphology forensically to determine the most appropriate method
	of handling some of the cases that appeared in _his_ court.

	Most courts in the United States regard the forensic use of
	graphology as dubious, at best.   A few have ruled against 
	it.

	sixties.

	consumption.

	You are taking a completely hypothetical situation that never had
	a basis in what could have happened.

	An individual who had seen another individual's handwriting _once_
	could deem themselves to be an expert, for that particular person's
	writing.  As such, an illiterate stable boy, who had seen his 
	master writing something twenty years prior, was deemed 
	more knowledgable
	about his master's script, than a QDE who had exemplars and
	the suspect document, and could demonstrate the authenticity or
	lack thereof, from the script.  

	After several cases where the QDE's opinion was deemed incorrect,
	and later it was discovered that the QDE's opinion was correct,
	the rules of the acceptability of an expert witness became somewhat
	stricter.  

	As the rules regarding who could be an expert witness became
	stricter, the requirements for obtaining authentic samples
	of writing became more urgent.   Subpoenaing documents from
	numerous bodies << corporations and individuals >> became a 
	standard way of obtaining exemplars.  Such exemplars were/
	are not always satisfactory, because they may be signatures
	only -- in the case of checks, or be written under non-ordinary
	conditions --- such as filed tax forms, or other reasons.

	By requesting an individual provide an authentic sample, 
	the ease with which a document can be demonstrated to be
	authentic, or not, is considerbly increased.  And the 
	likelyhood of error creeping in, is decreased dramatically.

	Now if you'd rather have an illiterate stabhle boy, that saw
	you write something 20 years ago be considered an expert as
	regards what your handwriting looks like...

	What they said.
	Where they said it. 
	What they had in their possession.
	Where they had said items in their possession.

	Note in passing that rules for admitting something into 
	evidence was a lot looser then, than it is now.

	I do?   That's news to me, and the rest of graphological profession
	that we benefit from current government policy --- especially in
	light of rulings that imply that graphology can not be used for 
	employment screening, selection or profilling.
