In other Java news, the report from the Princeton scientists who have
found many security weaknesses in Java is now available at <URL:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/pub/secure96.html >.  It is very critical
of the language design and implementation.  I don't fully agree with the
thrust of their criticisms, because I don't think provability is a
practical matter with programs complex enough to be useful.  But they
have certainly identified an alarming number of problems.  I will post
later today a list of the issues they have identified.
