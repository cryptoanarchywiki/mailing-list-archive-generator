It seems that FUD got him.  ...sigh...

It does sound like the guy is overreacting a bit.  However, I don't know 
much about Quebec politics; with that close vote recently on separation, 
perhaps they are getting nervous about things. Is he in Quebec? 

I can say, however, that I've never gotten any kind of "official" feedback 
on the subject, not that I really expect it.  I've gotten a few inquiries 
which on the surface appear to be innocuous, but which I suspect have hidden 
motives.  This could be a little hidden official research, or maybe just 
self-motivated individuals trying to do a "good deed."  It doesn't matter; 
my idea doesn't need any secrets in order to be successful.
