I've actually been thinking about using chaos to sporadically add noise to some information before the info is encrypted.  After decryption, the receiver would then have to separate the noise from the real content.
Has anyone else thought about this?  Please respond directly to nyap@garban.com 'cos I'm no longer on the cypherpunks list.
