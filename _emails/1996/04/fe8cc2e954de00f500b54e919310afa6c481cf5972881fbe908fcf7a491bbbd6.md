I note for the record that I never predicted that the terms and
conditions would be complex or unresolved, but that you would alter
the claim and the logistics of the wager to the point where you might
evade the consequences of loss.

I note for the record that it was your post that originally supported its
accuracy with a call for wagering.

I note for the record that your claim, as you originally put it, was quite
clear.

There is no dispute of terms or conditions.  This is an uncomplicated
issue.

If your claim, as written, is correct, I shall pay to you or your
appointed agent US$ 100.

If it is false, you shall pay to me or my appointed agent US$ 100.

The only issue is how you wish to modify that claim for the purposes of
the wager so as to bring it within a semblence of accuracy.

Absent further interest on your part, I consider the matter closed and 
your claim retracted.
