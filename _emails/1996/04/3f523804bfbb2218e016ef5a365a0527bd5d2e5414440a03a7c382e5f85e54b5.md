	could we please dispense with the posts cc'ing the list about
these idiots? I already never read posts by idiots because they aren't
in my list of people I read, but I have to read these replies.

	The proper steps to take when someone makes such a posting:

A) Flame them privately
B) Subscribe them to clueless@c2.org
