I bounced this off a CPA, who said she would be very suprised if this is
really the case: in general the IRS considers increases in wealth to be
taxable, and unless there's a specific exclusion for currency transactions
that she doesn't know about, she suspects this is not the case.  As a
conceptual counterexample she points out that you are responsible for any
profit you make from selling your car for more than you pay for it (but,
as you might expect, you don't get to take a loss if you sell it for less).

My tame CPA also volunteered the information that the IRS is very interested
and concerned about how they're going to capture transaction information for
electronic transactions, and they do think it's in their bailiwick... she's
read some articles on it.
