You could try using isite (see http://www.cnidr.org/), which is a pretty 
cool search engine, and should work well enough, and the patrie structure 
could make restarts really fast . 

The real answer to your question depends almost entirely on the machine
you wish to run it on- is memory not a problem? If so, tries may be your
best bet, though you may have bad cache interactions. Otherwise, you might
be best going for a probabalistic approach and using hash table to elimate
definite non-matches, then an AVL-Tree or similar for confirmation. If you
just use a single bit for each hash-table datum, you can afford to make
the table pretty sparse
