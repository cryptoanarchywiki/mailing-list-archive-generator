By this argument the Soviet Empire could never fall.

Governments are rarely overthrown.  Rather, they collapse.

Governments continually struggle to maintain cohesion. 

Sometimes they fail.  They do not naturally have cohesion.  
A government is not naturally a single thing, not an 
entity by nature, the way a person is an entity by nature.

False on two counts:   

First "frenzy" is exactly the opposite of what the 
government needs to stay in one piece, to continue 
to be a government.

Secondly, when you cut of someones air supply, 
they do not necessarily defend themselves.

I think I may have reported in cypherpunks my 
little experiment in Cuba when I cut off a cop's 
air supply, to test my hypothesis that even the 
cuban cops have a slave mentality.

People frequently fail to defend themselves, 
when suitably intimidated, and this is basically what 
governments rely upon.  If governments have to start
pulling guns all the time, they will fall.
