In addition to the posted weaknesses (which were mainly implementation issues),
there's another major problem with this - it means that the user's passwords
have to be stored on the Host machine (or an authentication server) in 
_plaintext_, rather than storing a hash (e.g. like Unix passwords.)
This means that if the host's password file is cracked, the entire system loses.

You can do a little better than this by having the password file encrypted
with a key which the login process / authentication server has, requiring 
theft/cracking of that key (difficult) as well as theft of the password file;
the encryption could either be a symmetric-key system or public-key if you're
willing to spend the decryption time, which CompuServe probably isn't.

A couple years ago I found an obvious application of Diffie-Hellman which
avoids this problem; unfortunately it turned out to be patented by someone
from Siemens (first as a German patent and then a US patent, so it's
definitely too much trouble to try to overturn the patent...)
The basic approach is to use a commutative hash function, which lets
both sides calculate HA(B) == HB(A) ; modular exponentiation worked fine.

Of course, if you're allowing active attacks, there's always session
hijacking...
