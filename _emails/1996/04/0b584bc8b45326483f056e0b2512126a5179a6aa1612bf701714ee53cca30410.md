I don't have a good guess for this, but Arjen did say that the cost to
break RSA-130 was a fraction of what it cost to break RSA-129 because
of the improved algorithm, so I'd guess we'll find out soon.  The next
target of the consortium is planned to be RSA-155, I believe, which is
above 512 bits; that means skipping RSA-140 to go for the one with the
higher psychological value.  While 512-bit PGP keys are interesting to
Cypherpunks, other 512-bit RSA keys are vitally important to some banks.
