As I understand it, your test goes like this:

Is handler an "expert"?

Yes?  :  Examine procedures to determine liability.

No?   :  Handler is liable.

That's two standards.  One standard of strict liability (for the
non-expert) and one of negligence (for the expert).

Other way around.  Negligence is milder.  Negligence is merely the absence
of due care.

Recklessness:  The state of mind accompanying an act, which either pays no
regard to its probably or possibly injurious consequences, or which,
though forseeing such consequences, persists in spite of such knowledge.
Recklessness is a stronger term than mere or ordinary negligence...
Black's Law Dictionary 6d., (1990).

Ok.  The standards you have created for knowledgeable and unknowledgeable
people are different.  My key objection to your position was your view
that it was 1> an objective determination and 2> a single standard.  It is
neither.

Adequate for who?  You've already said that the court has to determine if
someone is knowledgeable first.  (And thus in your test bypass the
automatic finding of liability).  This is a very complicated test you're
designing.

Above you say "Someone with training ought to be expected to do the
'right' thing."  That sounds like a stricter standard on CPR types.  i.e.,
someone without training ought not to be expected to do the right thing.
In this good faith helper at the side of the road example, do you want to
punish the CPR type for doing his best despite his ignorance?  (You might,
I'm just trying to clarify your position, which seems internally
inconsistant to me).

I didn't know you ment willfully.  I don't see that anywhere.

No.  Not exactly.  It's more of a "wrong without a remedy" deal.

Both of those are crimes today.

The point is that allowing that disparity seems silly.

But under your test it doesn't matter.  He didn't know how to attempt CPR,
he's liable.

And in your test there is a presumption of fault on the non-expert.  If he
did everything right purely by accident or from what he saw on "baywatch"
and the victim dies anyway, under your test he's cooked.

Woah.  Ok.  So you want a reasonable person determination of the activity
and if the activity falls within a dangerous defintion.  (This is called
ultrahazardous activity in tort law).  Then you want strict liability on a
non-expert who engages in that activity, and a "reasonable expert"
standard on the expert who engages in that activity?

Putting aside for a moment my already voiced concerns, doesn't the idea of
having a "reasonable person" standard on the classification of an
ultrahazardous activity seem silly?  Does nuclear physics seem dangerous
to Joe Sixpack?  What about Cold Fusion experimentation?  Microwave
repair?  Seems there's a tremendous opportunity for error in that kind of
standard.  It also has the effect of making the scope of the definition of
"ultrahazardous" very large.  The larger it is, the more interference and
common law regulation you're going to have on the economy.  _Particularly_
so where you are imposing a strict liability standard.

Just legally, an objective standard is when you hold everyone to a
reasonable person standard.  Everyone is Joe Blow.  Would Joe Blow have
done this that or the other thing.  As soon as you start talking "experts"
you're out of the objective field.

Then why impose it without an examination into fault on non-experts?  In
your test the non-expert bears the burden of showing he's an expert if he
wishes to prevail.  The victim need only say "He was doing CPR, I got
hurt, he's a non-expert."  Wham, liability under your test.  That's not a
burden at all.  It's certainly not a burden of showing negligence.

Or under your test, liable until proven expert.

As for faulty assumptions, go to court someday.  They are common.
In designing systems one _must_ assume them.
