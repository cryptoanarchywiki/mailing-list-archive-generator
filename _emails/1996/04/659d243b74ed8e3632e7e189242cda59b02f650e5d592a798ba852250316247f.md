You have to be pretty damn stupid if you need to go out and surf the 'net 
to find out that gunpowder can be found in shotgun shells.

Big news flash: you can find fertilzer at the hardware store, rust on  your
daddy's Chevy, and bird doodoo in the back yard.  Anybody who wants 
to figure out how to make explosives and CAN'T is too stupid to have 
graduated from high school (and probably too stupid to navigate the 
'net). They're much more likely to go down to the local surplus store, 
and learn all this out of old U.S. military training manuals than to find 
it on the 'net.

Who voted for these morons? They are only doing this because anything 
involving the 'net will get their NAMES IN THE NEWS.

I don't know where this might be - it is illegal in most states to sell 
ammunition to minors. I'm guessing that it is illegal in all states, 
(though Texas has some interesting views).
I used to have to send my mother to the store for .38 wadcutters ...

Yeah, I think every kid I grew up with did this by the time they were 10 
years old. Back when there were about 10 computers on the internet, and 
none of us had ever seen one. When we were younger, we used to spend 
hours extracting gunpowder from the paper strips used in toy cap pistols 
and cutting the heads off matches.

I wouldn't want my kids playing with things like this, but your kid is
an idiot if they need to surf the 'net to figure out that gunpowder can be
found in ammunition.
