Now, if this is your postion, let's see some support.

If you're trying to tell me that your going to see some mass uprising of 
the baby ISP's just because compelled discovery orders leave a sour taste 
in Mr. Bell's or anyone else's mouth, I just think you are a fool.

Compelled discovery orders work because they are backed with the 
very credible threat of financial and custodial sanctions.  Obstruction, 
or conspiracy is a crime, and in the case of the FBI, a federal crime of 
some magnitude.

While some ISP's may indeed feel they are able to resist the whims and 
enforcement powers of the United States, they are likely to be offshore, 
small, and viewing themselves as out of the reach of U.S. jurisdiction.  

With the scope of U.S. jurisdiction for compelled discovery, however, 
I think that most ISP's will find themselves in for significant surprises.

Mr. Bell somehow assumes that smaller ISP's will be less vulnerable.  I 
believe this in error.  Smaller ISP's won't even have the financial 
wherewithall to fight a compelled discovery order properly, much less 
actualy prevail in court where it is firmly estlablished that compelled 
discovery orders will be enforced and enforced with vigor, and that 
judicial review will be a waste of time.

Part of Mr. Bell's error lies in his basic assumptions about the 
political makeup and convictions of the general business community, even 
the small business community.

Mr. Bell, as demonstrated by his belief that small ISP's and other 
service providers will risk freedom, fines, and asset forfeiture, seems to 
think that the rumblings of a grass roots revolution are in the wind.  
Why Mr. Bell thinks this, other than the fact that it seems his personal 
fantasy, is without explanation.

It is worth bearing in mind that subpoenas are not the only tool that 
authorities can use to affect compliance.  In many cases authorities 
simply seize the equipment and hold it for the statuatory period before 
which  they are required to file charges in.  The Ripco BBS in Chicago, 
victim of the Sun Devil raids, is a prime example.  In that case the 
equipment was seized (via sealed warrant which later proved to authorize 
seizure of "computer or other electronic equipment of any nature."  and in 
actuality resulted in the seizure of everything from disks to printers 
to telephones), and held for five years before finally being returned.  
Clearly it was obsolete by this time.  No charges have been filed.

While I'm sure Mr. Bell would sacrifice hardware, freedom, cash, (though 
I'm sure he would insist on representing himself), and time to fight the 
tyrany of the FBI, I don't see every ISP suddenly turning into a Montana 
freemen armed standoff with the authorities, which is what it would 
practically take to resist such warrants and exercise of authority, even 
by preemptive or malicious encryption or disposal of data.

In short, welcome to the real world, Mr. Bell.

In practice many ISP's or phone co's will not have the opportunity to 
defend the matter in court without their services and equipment being 
forcibly seized preemptively.

So the ISP sues their client to notify them of the wiretap?  Or the ISP 
sues the FBI and then draws the client into the suit?  I'm not sure what 
you mean here.  In any event it's a totally meaningless point as ongoing 
investigations could easily be blinded and the ISP or telco charged with 
willful obstruction or conspiracy to destroy material evidence to a 
crime, accessory after the fact in effect.

What you have described is a crime.  Your "clever" lawsuit isn't going to 
fool any judge, or anyone else.

Wrong.  See above.

This argument relies heavily on the absence of other persuasion to comply 
with wiretaps, which, as I have demonstrated, exist in abundance.  Thus the 
thing falls in upon itself.

Significant precedent exists, see my note.

You're claiming that a court is going to distinguish the case where a 
small ISP/telco refuses to comply with a compelled discovery order from a 
case where a large telco typically complies with a discovery on the basis 
that the large company complies only under compulsion or in self interest?

This amounts to "A obeys the law because he wants to.  B doesn't want to 
obey the law, therefore B need not."

The "attorney" who makes this argument will be laughed out of the courtroom.

As I have tried to explain to Mr. Bell before, the days of legal 
formalism are over.  Substance over form prevails today.  The substance 
of this transaction is to inform the client that an investigation is 
ongoing.  This is a major no-no, whatever Mr. Bell thinks he knows.

As I explained before, contracts are void to the extent they are 
illegal.  Mr. Bell's response?  "Well, then we'll kill him and enforce 
the contract that way."

Your use of the word "indirect" is stretching the bounds of the 
imagination.  A judge, unless sleeping through argument, would see 
through this like glass.

Incorrect.  They have been challenged time and time again in the context 
of compelled discovery.  Time and time again compelled discovery has been 
required, TRO's forbidding the destruction of documents and other 
evidence issued, search warrants and seizure effected in place of subpoena.

The telco in past has not complied with such orders because of some grand 
government conspiracy, although I realized Mr. Bell finds such things 
immensely sexy.  It has complied because its officers faced criminal and 
financial sanctions for non-compliance.

There are ways to resist compelled discovery.  These are not they.
