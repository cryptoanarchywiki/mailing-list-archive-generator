Hmm. In the days of COCOM (a relative of ITAR) there was a doctrine that
individual pieces of a mosaic may be unclassified, yet together they may
form a whole that needs to be export-controlled.

Likewise 8-bit values 0x46,0x55,0x43,0x4B may not be obscene individually,
but together they comprise a vile, CDA-prohibited obscenity.
