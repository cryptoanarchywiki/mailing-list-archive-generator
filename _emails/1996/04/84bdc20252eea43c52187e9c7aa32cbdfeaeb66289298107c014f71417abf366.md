I thought of a method of exporting encryption code that doesn't require an 
export license, but better yet makes some _deserving_ soul a criminal.   (In 
hindsight, it seems obvious, although I don't recall seeing it discussed.)

Basically, you take advantage of the fact that on the Internet, 
incorrectly-addressed email is often/usually returned to what appears to be 
the sender.  For example, send PGP source, split into appropriately-sized 
chumks, to somebody like   bigshot@nsa.com.    Mis-spell his name, of 
course, and forge the note so that it appears to be coming from some 
out-of-country address.  His ISP's system's email software sees the bad address, 
"returns" it, and it's sent to that out-of-US location.  Keep the messages 
as evidence; forward them to the appropriate prosecutor, who is stuck 
between a rock and a hard place:  Either he prosecutes a "good guy," or he 
fails to prosecute an unauthorized encryption exporter and thus sets up a 
bad precedent.
