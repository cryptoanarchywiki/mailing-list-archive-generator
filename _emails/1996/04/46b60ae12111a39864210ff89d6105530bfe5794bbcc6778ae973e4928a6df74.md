But what is "guilty knowledge"?  Let's suppose I'm web-browsing, and I come 
across something I shouldn't.  If I'm aware of caching, I _know_ that the 
stuff is in my memory or HD or somewhere, and I _know_ it's illegal.  Does 
that constitute "guilty knowledge"?

What if a person is unaware of this caching?  Does he lack the same guilty 
knowledge?

See, this is the problem with the "guilty knowledge" idea:  It really isn't 
knowledge which should be illegal, intent is vital.  Part of the reason 
"our" system is so screwed up is that police can misrepresent our actions in 
this way.

I have an easy solution for this:  _NO_ information should be illegal.  None.
