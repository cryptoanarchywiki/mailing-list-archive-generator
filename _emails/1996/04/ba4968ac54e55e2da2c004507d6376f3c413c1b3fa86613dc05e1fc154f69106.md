Nope, sorry. Some of the interest is used to fund the Fed overhead
itself -- salaries, heat, electricity and the like. The rest is
"returned" to the treasury (actually, it was never paid out in the
first place and it was all funny money to begin with.)

Also false. All of the board of governors of the Fed are government
appointees. In some theoretical sense the Fed isn't part of the
government, but in all practical terms it is. Greenspan has to worry
about whether Bill Clinton is going to reappoint him and congress will
reconfirm him, not about whether the member banks think he's doing a
good job.

The myth that the fed is a private entity is an enduring one in
conspiracy theory circles, but its trivial to check that it isn't the
case.
