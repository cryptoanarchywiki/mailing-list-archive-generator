     Some would say that 1) Saddam (as a problem) was _created_ by the US, 
and it would not be in the interest of certain people to have him die.
Along the same lines, Castro, while not exactly friendly (and who can blame 
him) to the US, is also not a threat, and never really has been. Killing 
him would serve no purpose.

     Killing some one (the physical act, not the emotional consequences) is
easy. Denyability is a little (only a little) tougher.

     There are always Captians who go down with the ship, Boys who stick 
their fingers in dykes, and Some fool leading the charge when the odds
are overwhelming. This is either the highest calling (to fight back against 
all odds, and refuse to give in) or pure stupidity (he who runs away lives
to fight another day). You pick.

    If by "at will" you mean _any time_ _any where_, yeah. Short of building
your own nuclear device, yeah. If you mean there are people who can't be 
gotten to, then no. Everyman has his price, and his coin. 


    The second time AP is implicated in a murder, and is not stopped, then 
it will _start_ to intimidate. More likely it will be stopped.

     There are no illegitimate targets.

     Doubtful. It would take more than one talented person. It would take
an organization, and a permanent net connextion. This would be difficult for
a lone psychopath to carry out.

     Bullshit. Is Einstein morally responsible for the Atomic Bomb? 

     Col. Colt for the murders that the guns he created accomplished? 

     Ronald McDonald & his PR firm for all of the obese people in this 
     country?

     Driving 65 is very close to driving 66, which is against the law.
I suggest that people think very carefully before driving at 65 miles 
per hour. 

> PS it is not censorship to stop people from advocating murder.

     Yes, it is. Especially when other people do it all the time, and don't
get punished. Clinton just "murdered" a bunch of people in Iraq. He talked
about it, then he did it. He calls it "War". So do I. I am involved in a 
war for _my_ rights. I will probably loose, but I must do what I determine
is right. Assinating the president would not further my goals. At no time 
in the foreseeable future would killing the president bring me any closer to
my goals. This being so, killing the president would be a stupid idea.

     When I joined the Marine Corps, I took an oath to protect this country,
the constitution, and the government against all enemies foreign and 
domestic. To me, the order I wrote them is the order of presidence. The
government is attacking the constitution regularly. I do what I can to stop 
that. If that means taking up arms as either a part of organized revolt, or
a long lunatic, so be it.
