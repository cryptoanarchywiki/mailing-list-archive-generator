Please excuse my bluntness, but you obviously get your info out of a 
book, whereas I get mine from actual experience, which I can demonstrate 
quite well.  Your identical twins example means nothing, as it's totally 
likely that: 1) Few identical twins separated early are really available 
for study and  2) Far fewer yet would have a substantially different 
environment awaiting them.  This is one test you'd certainly have to do 
purposely (separating them, that is).

Your testimonial of IQ's is equally dubious, excepting you should come 
up with a test that measures actual intelligence.

The "wide range of similar behavior" puts the torch to your argument.
If you want to argue that the twins would grow nearly always to the same 
height, I could allow that (but still argue the point), but behavior?
Please!
