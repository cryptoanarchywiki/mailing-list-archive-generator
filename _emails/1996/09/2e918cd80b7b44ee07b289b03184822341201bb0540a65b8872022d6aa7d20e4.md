Upon further reflection, I agree with Lucky. I will say that the _really_ 
bad news is that our opponents seem to be getting smarter. <sigh> Or else 
I'm just getting dumber. :(

Also: If any more of you have comments for Judge Kozinski, please send them 
to me soon. Comments from stable nyms (such as you, Lucky) are especially 
appreciated, and with your permission I will include this message. Please 
tell me if you want me to include your e-mail address in the message to 
Judge Kozinski. TIA.
