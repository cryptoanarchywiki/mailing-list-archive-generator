They lost: it is still available.  If they went after another mirror
the number of mirrors would double :-)

Someone in the German press needs to rub their noses in the fact that
they lost, say by printing a list of URLS, or just mentioning the
number of mirrors, and the different countries they are located in.

The need to translate the quote:

	`The internet sees censorship as damage, and routes around it'

and put that in big letters.

Any German net freelance journalists reading?
