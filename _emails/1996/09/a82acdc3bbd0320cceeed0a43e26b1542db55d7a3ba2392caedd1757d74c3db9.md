This goes along with what others have postulated.

But I have to wonder -- how long will the [re]train take?
One of the gripes about PEP was that retrains were slow....
This sounds slower.

Further, how stable will the outcome be -- will the 'slop' in the 
CO's AD conversion overwhelm things?

Lastly, what will the RBOC's do to stifle its use? [I take it as a
given that they will object to anything that benefits subscribers
and does not give them an added cut.. witness ISDN pricing, for
example.]
