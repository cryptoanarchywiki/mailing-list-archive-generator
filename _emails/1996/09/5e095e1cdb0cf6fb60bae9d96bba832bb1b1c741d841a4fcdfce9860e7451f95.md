Exactly correct.  The current system is intended to present the illusion 
that it is the product of the voters, where it is really defined by the 
political establishment.

Bill Stewart pointed out (correctly) that what I'm proposing is "mechanism 
without a built-in policy."  While this may appear to be a bit reckless, the 
reason I'm confident it will work is that the status quo has a 
_throughly_corrupt_ policy, a policy which is actively hostile to the 
interests and rights of the average citizen.  Replacing that system with one 
that is merely neutral is a great improvement, particularly if there is no 
way for that policy to be hijacked by a tiny minority of the public.
