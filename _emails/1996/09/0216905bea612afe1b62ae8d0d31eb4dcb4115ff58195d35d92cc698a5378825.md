It also provided anonymity to many people who needed it.  I think that many
people who need anonymity will probably just learn faking mail and news
headers.  Many people just don't want to deal with cpunk remailers.  OTOH, I
agree that this might actually force many people with Penet addresses to learn
about more secure remailers.  In this way, the closing of anon.penet.fi could
be looked upon as a Good Thing.  However, as long as there is no easy way for
Windoze and Mac users to use secure remailers, users will sooner resort to
fake-mailing then learning how to use cpunk remailers.  People that need a
pseudonym address to use on various support groups can get them from other,
equally insecure, remailers.
