Hello all.  I assist in running an ISP.  We recently had a problem with 
some of the users massmailing from our server.  We would have never known, 
but someone on CompuServe that didn't like it mailed our support email 
address.  We checked into it, and I called the two people voice.  It pretty 
gratifying to be able to talk to one of these spammer massmailer 'get rich 
quick' scheme people directly.  

What I'm looking for is a way to monitor the amount of mail leaving the 
system per user.  I'm not interested in poking into users mail, but I would 
like the ability to spot other users sending out more than x messages per x 
minutes.  If anyone has any tips on this subject I'd like to hear them.  
Spam and massmailing is one of the major things that's bogging down the net 
these days, I believe.

Thanks
