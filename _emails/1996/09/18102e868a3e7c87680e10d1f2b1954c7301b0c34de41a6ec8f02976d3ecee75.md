The install is only 5MBs. Part of that 10MB package is a silly collection of
netscape plugins which don't have to be installed. I guess they could be
nice if I tried them.

It also only works on NT4 regardless of what the web page says.

With it's ability to run a program on receiving an email based upon filter
criteria the possibilities are endless. (I know I know old hat for unix but
so whiz bang for NTnoids like me.)
