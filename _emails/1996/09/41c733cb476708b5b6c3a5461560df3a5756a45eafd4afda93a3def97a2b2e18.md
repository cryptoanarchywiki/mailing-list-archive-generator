Not only that, but you're also looking at a potential lawsuit, unless such 
a list were compiled and managed through the use of a nymserver.  Since 
there's no way, within reasonable limits, that a cryptogrpahic program can 
be proven bad, then a lawsuit is inevitable.  I could potentially see a 
list of products which have "methods which have been proven ineffective in 
securing data against determined attacks" such as DES, etc., but otherwise, 
it's just begging for trouble.
