I'll have to let somebody else answer this one, since I am really not
sure.

As far as anybody knows, you're right, exponentiation is a one way
function in a prime field.  

However, there are some things to be said. If you're using a fixed g and
N, or repeat both for too many key exchanges, if anybody logged them, it
becomes a more exciting target, since the hard part of the algorithms
need be completed only once.  Then taking separate logs with the same g
and N is easy.

The field used in DH is just a standard Galois Field mod some large
prime.
