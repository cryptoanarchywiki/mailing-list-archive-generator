Just a comment: "The world population really should go back to around 
one billion", etc. And how could we achieve that without severe govt. 
oppression, one wonders? Now, I've heard of "education" being used to 
help the masses learn to be responsible citizens ad nauseam, but since 
education is pretty much just propaganda in the massively-capitalist 
system now taking over even the P.R. of China, how the heck is education 
going to work?
