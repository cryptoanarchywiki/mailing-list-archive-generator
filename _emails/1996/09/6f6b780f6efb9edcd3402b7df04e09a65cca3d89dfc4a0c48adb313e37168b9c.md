Concur.  Microsoft products are used not necessarily because of
quality or functionality (which are often dubious, but
very occasionally present), but because of user interface and/or
market share.

I still like FreeBSD.  Similar functionality, similar availability-
of-source, but very slightly easier to install/run/manage/play with.
Similarly free.

(FreeBSD was able to find my modem, something I couldn't get Linux
to do after most of an hour.  Of course I'm a *nix novice for the
most part.)

I'm not sure about that... X-Windows seems to have a decent interface,
runs on Linux, hell, most any *nix you care to name, and has some
decent editors available.  (Or, there's always emacs, but aunt
Ethel might not grok emacs too well.  I don't :)
