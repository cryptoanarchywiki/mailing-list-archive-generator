This constant character assasination of Tim is getting rather boring, 
as far as I can see, and I read all of the posts on the list, he has 
done nothing more than ignore posts from these idiots, that is his 
choice and nothing to do with anyone else.
This whole thread is taking up too much space and is just totally 
pointless. lets call it a day and just agree to differ eh?
