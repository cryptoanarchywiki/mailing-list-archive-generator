The same useless and boring message posted by rote to a huge collection of
addresses is spam, unless participation is voluntary and consensual, in

Given that less than 1% of those spammed are likely to reply, and merely 
hit the delete key and curse a bit, you are hereby awarded approximately 
100 dead skunks.
