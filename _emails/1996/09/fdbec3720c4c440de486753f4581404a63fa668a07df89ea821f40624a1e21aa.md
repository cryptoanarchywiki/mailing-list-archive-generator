I think Tim's comments are generally on-point. EFF board members are paying
attention to discussions on the cypherpunks list and the organization would
appear to be moving in a direction that will result in a solid
pro-anonymity policy.

For reference, EPIC's position is:

"Our position is that we strongly support anonymity both for speech and for
transactions. The right to anonymous speech is a constitutionally protected
right (Tally v. California, McIntrye v Ohio) and we believe that it equally
applies in cyberspace. Anonymous transactions are a key way (and perhaps the
only way that really works) to provide privacy on the net."

CDT's current position is:

"CDT believes that anonymous political speech is protected under the first
amendment and would oppose any effort to restrict or curtail it on the
Net."
