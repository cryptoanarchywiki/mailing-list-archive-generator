That is one instance where it was obscure and workable. I am not familiar 
with the UNIX binary map, but in the Intel DOS world (includes Windows to 
a large degree), the stack generally lies at the top of DSEG, not CSEG  and 
flows down. Older incarnations of x86 allowed for such wonders as:

	push	ds
	push	cs
	pop	ds

	[ series of writes ]

	pop	ds

and viola, self modifying code by one method. Ugly, but it works. 
Variations on the same theme exist, now that Intel does not allow direct 
manipulation of the IP anymore. It's not that difficult to do. Some of the 
digital audio work I was involved in several years ago required modifying 
code sequencing on the fly to accomodate time delays and different types 
of processor performance.

Intel binaries are not difficult to modify directly - especially when 
they are DOS binaries (note the plethora of viruses in the medium). Even 
good code can be reworked without having source. One of the tricks is to 
grab the intial JMP off the binary header and point it down past the 
bottom of the existing binary towards the code you have added. This way 
on startup DOS does not truncate the new binary size via Function 31h. 
Now all you have to do is mudge the read section and look for your 
trigger before executing the additional code. What I have just described 
is a very simplistic viral mechanism.

Escape sequence hacking in DOS has been done since the day ANSI.SYS came 
out to play. IT was a quick and dirty trick to send escape sequence laden 
files to the unsuspecting and ask them to type them to the screen. Then 
the fun began.

When you stop and think about it though, any application that functions 
as a data engine of some type is susecptible at some level to this form 
of attack. The issue is really which method to employ that will give you 
ROI.
