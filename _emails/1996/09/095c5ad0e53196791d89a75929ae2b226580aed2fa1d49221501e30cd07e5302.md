My appologies in advance to the list for this noise.  Dear Anonymous, if
there is another way to contact you, please let it be known so that this
need not involve the 1500 others on the list.

No, it's not.  "the address will be: anon-01020304@as-node.jena.thur.de"
implies that the address will be anon-01020304@as-node.jena.thur.de

0x is used to indicate that the characters that follow are in hexadecimal.

Exactly.  Just the pseudonym.  Remember that at this point, you do not
know what your pseudonymous address will be, because the keys have not
been generated.

Yes, identical in function.

I use PGP 2.6.2 as distributed by MIT.  The command line in my re-written
help file works for my copy of PGP.  The command line in the original help
file appearantly works for the international edition, although I am not
able to confirm this.

Multiple words work fine, but yes, that should be fine.

Yes, that is correct -- be sure that you are signing with your nym's key,
and not your own.  Also be sure that the remailers you are using are
functional.

As soon as the mail arrives, that is correct.  If it was lost by using a
non-operational remailer, or by sending a misformatted mail, then it will
not.

Correct.  All of this should be starting at column 0, with no indentation.

It may be lag, it may not be.  I recommend that you create a test nym,
with minimal anonymity (no remailers, send everything directly to jena)
and, after waiting several hours to ensure that the key was added, send a
mail from your nym to your own account.  If you get no mail after several
hours, something is wrong.

That's exactly right.  We need better message pools.  Actually, what is
needed is a email message pool, because of the lag and uncertainly of
Usenet.  But that's a project for another day.

hth.
