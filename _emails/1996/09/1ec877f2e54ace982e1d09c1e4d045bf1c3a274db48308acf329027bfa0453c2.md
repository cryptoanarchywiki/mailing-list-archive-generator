It may be because until the 14th amendment incorporated the BoR against
the states, only individuals enjoyed its protections -- the Slaughterhouse
cases extended the BoR to corporations. Or it may just be that CyberPromo
knew they probably didn't have a leg to stand on when it came to the BoR,
and decided to try a safer tack.

Agreed. Regardless of the outcome, this is a case to watch.
