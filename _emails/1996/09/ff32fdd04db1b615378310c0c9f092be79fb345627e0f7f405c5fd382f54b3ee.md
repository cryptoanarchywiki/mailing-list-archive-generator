Yes, that "they'll cut off the Internet!" talk doesn't seem to be very 
practical.  Society very quickly develops dependency on inventions.  Try to 
take away their computers and they'd scream; take away their telephone and 
it'd be worse!  Give Internet another couple of years and 50% of big 
business would be severely impacted should it be cut off.  Wait five years 
and the world would practically stop rotating without Internet.

On a related issue, GPS (global-positioning system) contains a de-accurizing 
mis-feature called S/A, which adds a little error to the location as 
detected by a receiver.  Ostensibly, it was added so that this could be 
turned on in wartime, to deny the enemy the ability to make 10-meter fixes.  
Turns out that it was kept on all the time, probably because if it WASN'T it 
would become politically impossible to de-accurize the system even in wartime.
