Thanks to all the help I got last week, I have located the
BIS report on Smart Card Security.  I have C&P'd and squeezed
it into HTML format.  There are still many errors in it, notably
many double words that C&P contributed, and I haven't touched the
Annexes (messy footnotes, no graphics or headings).  However, for
those desparate to get their hands on it, go to our page:

	http://www.systemics.com/docs/papers/

and type (anti-bot protocol format):

	BIS_smart_security.html

at the end of the URL.  The real (no errors :-) document is located at:

	http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss18.htm

but only the forward, exec summary and intro are there at the
moment.  When they are all there, I will drop my version.  I
am not really that keen on repairing the errors in my version,
as I gather that BIS will make the original available some day.

But last I looked, they didn't have an email address, so who can say?
