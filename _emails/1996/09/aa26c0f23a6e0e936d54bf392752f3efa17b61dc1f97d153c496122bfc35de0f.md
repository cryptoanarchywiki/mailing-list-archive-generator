Where have you been for the last twenty years?

In fact a juror was recently jailed for this.  She had informed the other
juries of the likely severity of the punishment for pot, and refused 
to vote for conviction.

She was charged with perjury and various contrived and bogus charges.

The basis of perjury charge was that she had sworn there was no reason 
she could not do justice, and, according to the court, she was not
doing justice because of her opposition to the drug laws..
