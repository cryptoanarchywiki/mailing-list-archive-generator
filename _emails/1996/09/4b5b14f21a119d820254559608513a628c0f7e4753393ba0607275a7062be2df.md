Remember, folks, it is _governments_ which interfere with natural movements
of people, capital, but not birds.

I don't want to jeopardize my reputation as a List.Racist, but I think one
of the longterm (not in the next 15 years) implications of the things we
talk about will be the increased lowering of national borders. (Yes, I have
long talked about national borders being only speed bumps...here I'm
talking about _physical_ borders.)

Some good insights into the "border issue" are in the current movie "Lone
Star." See it to appreciate things from a Mexican's perspective, when Texas
is viewed as being essentially Mexican.  (Some great humor, too. And a good
murder mystery. And a love story. Conspiracy, humor, murder, love...all the
ingredients of a great story. All three major American races collide, and
mix. No role for Asians, though. Another movie...maybe a Wayne Wang movie.)

("Lone Star" is this year's "Pulp Fiction," just as "Usual Suspects" was
last year's "Pulp Fiction.")

Crypto anarchy means the undermining of governments, and hence handouts to
people by government. People will only move physically for physical jobs,
and not for handouts. People will flow to where the jobs are, and jobs will
flow to where the people are. Isn't this what we really want?
