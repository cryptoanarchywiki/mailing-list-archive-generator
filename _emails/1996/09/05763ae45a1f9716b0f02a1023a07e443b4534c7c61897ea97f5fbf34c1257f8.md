 Yes, a bunch of them:
 
 1. Get a life. Learn to delete unwanted e-mail. Get a real shell account.
 
 2. Ask AOL to let its users decide what e-mail to reject automatically (like
 procmail). They've been promising this capability by the end of September.
 Then you can set up your account to get no more e-mail from netfree.

Typical asshole response. I must thank chuck@nova..etc. for his TRULY helpful
response.
But you........get a real shell account?? I do thank you. netcom and a school
system. I can delete unwanted mail. But maybe I LIKE to yell at people who
spam me. And ive never received mail from netfree before..nor since... thats
NOT my problem. Learn to comprehend what pthers write. I wanted to know what
I can do about getting in coontact with them. It is in my opinion not right
to forge email addresses...people dont do it when the send me us postal mail
