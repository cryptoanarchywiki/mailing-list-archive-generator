I'm sitting here, listening to National People's Radio, and they have this
bit about a local kid who showed up in school today with 40 pages of bomb
making info, "gotten off of the internet". He was "caught" when he showed
his haul to his buddies.

Much gnashing of teeth and flying of fur ensued, and the kid was sent home.


More fun with numbers.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
