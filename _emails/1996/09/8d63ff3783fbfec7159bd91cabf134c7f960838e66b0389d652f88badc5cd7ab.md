Nothing. Neither does most other stuff posted to this list.

In general, on the average, yes.

Oh yes - I've seen idiots at private schools and I've seen smart kids at
public schools. They're exceptions.

Judging from your abuse of the English language, you're not.

The cirricula at public schools and the SAT requirements are pretty
lame, so any kid willing to spend enough time on them can become a
straight A student and feel good about himself/herself. I'm not impressed.

Opinions change.  His snotty attitude toward learning, his propensity to
wallow in his stupidity and ignorance the way a pig wallows in its own
excrement is a trait commonly acquired in the U.S. public school system.

I believe myself to be genetically superior to the vast majority of the
population. Not knowing much about your parents, other than they can't
afford to send you to a better school, I assume that they're part of
this vast majority.

(Make it both intellectually and physically superior. :-)

In general, on the average, yes.  I believe that being able to afford a
good private school for one's kids is a trait correlated to desirable
traits, some of which are inherited by the kids who benefit from the
better education.

That's eugenics in action.

Can you site any such studies? They certainly contradict what I know
about this area, and I consider myself pretty well-informed.

That's pretty much what I said. Other disciplinary problems (poor
attendance, talking back to teachers, weird dress, sex, etc) also
tend to be associated with the poor kids admitted on scholarships.
