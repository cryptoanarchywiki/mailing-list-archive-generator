You guys OBVIOUSLY confuse reality with cyberspace.  Grafitti is actual
property damage.  A message in an EmailBox is long, long way from
being comparable.  Let's make use of that "education" that seems to 
make you so proud.

nor do the children of men as a whole experience it.  Avoiding 
danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure.
