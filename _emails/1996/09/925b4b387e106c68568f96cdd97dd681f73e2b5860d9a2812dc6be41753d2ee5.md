Yeah, that's a particularly evil way of making things harder for people with
keysearch engines.  That's why in cryptlib when I'm doing something like key
exchange I encrypt all the parameters (algorithm, mode, etc etc) along with the
session key, so an attacker can't even tell what algorithm you're using[1]. I'd
thought of adding some sort of "choose a random algorithm and mode" capability
to cryptlib, but the user interface was too difficult to handle (finding a way
to let the user specify "We want a choice of DES-CFB, IDEA-OFB, DES-EDE-CBC, or
Blowfish-PCBC" is a bit of a pain).  In the end I took the easy way out by
adding an extended initialisation mode which allows the user to specify the
algorithm if they want, but left the possibility of one-algorithm-per-round
hashing alone.  A problem with using one of a fixed selection of algorithms is
that as you add new modes the selection changes, so you need to add more state
information to the key which specifies the choice of algorithms, which starts
to get messy.
 
I'd still love to add this in some form to keep the NSA amused... perhaps a
bit vector of allowable algorithms and modes passed to the setup function.

[1] There's a story from IBM when they were testing a new IBM-internal 
    encryption system for long-haul telecoms applications.  They were 
    playing around with bouncing encrypted transmissions off an IBM-owned 
    satellite when they were contacted by the NSA who said "You're not using 
    DES.  Stop it".
