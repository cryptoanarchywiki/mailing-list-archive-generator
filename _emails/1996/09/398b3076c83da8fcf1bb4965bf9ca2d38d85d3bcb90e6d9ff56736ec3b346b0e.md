If the speed of your key generation is an issue, you could do
something like:

   key[] = { 0 };
   const int nhashes = 4;
   typedef void (*hashfnptr)(byte*, byte*, int);
	/* array of hash functions */
   hashfnptr hash[ nhashes ] = { md5, sha1, haval, ... };

   state = hash[ 0 ]( algorithm, mode, parameters, userKey );

   for count = 1 to iterations
      for length = 1 to keyLength (in hash_output_size blocks)
		/* selecting a hash function based on the state */
         state = hash[ state % nhashes ]( state );
         key[ length ] = hash[ state % nhashes]( state, userKey );

This provides more expense in hardware for the same expense in
software, so for the same CPU time you get more hardware expense, and
could reduce the iterations for the same security.

`nhashes' determined by the number of digest algorithms you consider
trustworthy.

(They need hardware for `nhashes' different digest algorithms).

You need to do something about resolving the differing output and
state sizes.

Probably speed isn't an issue though.
