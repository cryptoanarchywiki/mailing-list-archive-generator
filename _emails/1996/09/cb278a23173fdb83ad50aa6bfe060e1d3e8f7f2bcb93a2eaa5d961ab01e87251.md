Last week I started a thread on the Telecom Regulation list.  My intention
was to introduce discussion of some circe-1780s Republican questioning, as
opposed to the widely accepted Federalist.  The most interesting composite
result is below:

>The Communications Act does not assert jurisdiction over, or require FCC

>federal jurisdiction or licensing as a matter of law, because radio

>they continue to propagate onward ad infinitum.  As a technical matter, a
>milliwatt-level millimeter-wave radio transmission from one end of a
>steel-encased underground chamber to a receiver at the other end propagates
>to points thousands of miles away, albeit at an undetectible level (i.e.,
>waaaaay below the noise floor), and it therefore could be viewed as an
>interstate radio transmission.  Practically, however, such transmissions
>stop at the steel shielding.  The FCC, therefore, will be unable to document
>that there was an interstate radio transmission and would likely be unable
>to shut you down.
>
>The FCC has adopted rules that permit unlicensed operation under common
>circumstances when there is unlikely to be any interstate effects.  Part 15
>sets forth power levels and other transmission parameters for certain
>frequency bands that do not require licensing.  Although the jurisdictional
>basis for Part 15 has never been expressly stated, the FCC views such
>transmissions as not, in any practical sense, likely to interfere with
>licensed transmissions, and the unlicense use of spectrum is conditioned on
>not interfering.
>
>One could argue that other low-power or physically confined radio
>transmissions are also unlikely to cross state lines as a practical matter,
>or to interfere with licensed transmissions, and are therefore beyond the
>FCC's jurisdiction.  The FCC has not conceded its jurisdiction in such
>cases, however.  There is currently litigation ongoing regarding a
>California (Berkeley, perhaps?) low-power FM station that did not obtain a
