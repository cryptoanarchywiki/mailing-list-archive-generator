It is very nice.  It is a bit on the hard side to get.  (Took me three
tries.  It seems to time out the transfer if it is not completed within a
certain time frame.  I guess that is what I get for trying to download all
three parts at the same time.)

It does have the beta nature however.  I have found a couple of problems
with the program that make it so that i will not use it beyond testing.  The
people at FTP have been very responsive to e-mail, so I expect the problems
to be fixed soon.  They also seem to have no idea as to what it will retail
for.  With proper marketing, Eudora could be in real trouble.

The interface design is very clean.  (It is nice seeing well designed dialog
boxes in a product. I have been using too much shareware lately I guess...)
The rules processing looks to be very powerful.  (Puts Eudora 3.0 to shame.)

Now all they need is a remailer interface.

(3) It is bigger than a battleship.  The distribution is just shy of 10
megs.  Installed it is supposed to be about 45 megs.  (In perspective, a
full install of Visual Basic 4.0 "Professional" is about 50 megs.)
