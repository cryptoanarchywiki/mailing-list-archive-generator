The same is true for Montreal (Royal Vale) using the equivalent scoring methods.
But there are public schools at both extremes of the curve.

While it is true that Private Schools would not survive due to market forces if
they did consistently poorly, it is also true that they filter their incoming
student body in a manner that Public Schools can not.

If you want to refuse those who are too stupid or anti-social from Public
Schools in order to improve the social or intellectual climate, you better have
a solution for the resulting cast-offs.
