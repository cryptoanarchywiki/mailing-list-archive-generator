I happen to work for Lexis-Nexis, but I don't speak for the company.  Yes,
P-Trak is real, it was recently made available to our customers.

It is NOT a scam to get SSNs.  Lexis-Nexis is a large and reputable company,
best-known for its huge legal database system, Lexis.  The Nexis side has
news reports from a large variety of sources.

P-Trak originally made SSNs available, but Lexis-Nexis removed this feature
in response to protests.
