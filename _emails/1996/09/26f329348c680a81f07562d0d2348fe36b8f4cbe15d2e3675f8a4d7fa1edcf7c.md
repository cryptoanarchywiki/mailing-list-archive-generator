Lessee if I have this right, now.  We have basically three scenarios:

1. Allow the status quo to continue (the justice system scam now run by
   Janet Reno/Louis Freeh types et al.
2. Allow the people some democracy in applying justice through AP.
3. Sometime in the future, build the Gort(?) robots, as in The Day The
   Earth Stood Still, and let them do the job.

Whatcha think?
