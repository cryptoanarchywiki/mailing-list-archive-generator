	Question:  Since the military, or more specifically,
	the CIA imports most of the drugs into the US, just which
	part of the military is going to declare war on which part
	of the military?  

	Or is all that going to get swept under the rug, so that 
	the ripocrats can further enslave the american population?

	However, if you're tired of the Lesser of N evils, 
	Cthulu's export policy is that you can't escape 
	anyway, and your puny mortal lives will be absorbed 
	along with his morning coffee.  Your encryption 
	technology is futile against the Elder Gods, and the 
	arcane formulas in the Cyphernomicon of that mad 
	physicist Tim The Enchanter may summon spirits from 
	the vasty deep, but no secrets are safe from 
	Nyarla-S-Ahothep who knows all and sees all.
