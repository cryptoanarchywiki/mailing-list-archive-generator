I personally, am not much for this, I am just one with various ideas, and 
questiosn and such, so here goes.

Ok, I agree with those.

Personally, by saying that no transmission on a standard phoneline can 
have more than 3100 baud, is a statement saying that technology and 
science, shall never advance, to a point where things are possible.
If you remember right, just 10 or so years ago, we stated that 2400 baud 
was the highest possible baud, and we would never go over.  My modem, 
running on a standard phone line, is a 28.8 USRobotics modem, with 
the software, and hardware upgrades to a 3400 baud, I get on an average 
day anywhere from 3500 to 3600 baud for send/receive.  On a bad day, I 
only get 3100 to 3200.  SO I would say, that my phone lines, are cleaner 
than most eh?  And Yes, I am in the US.
Speaking of ISDN, how many people, can afford to have a personal ISDN 
line in there house?  And then afford to connect to something/someone 
else on a next to permanent basis monthly?

What about new ways of splitting the steps and baud more so that it shows 
less at a higher level....  Just a question..  Ahh well, I'm getting a 
page so I shall finish this now...  Answer appreciated..
