Baud denotes the number of state changes made by the modem on the
line per second.  The possible states generally form some sort of
regular pattern in frequency/phase space, with each state being
maintained long enough to reliably determine it on the other end.

Before the advent of V32 and V32.bis modems, the underlying
symbol rate was substantially lower than it is now.  Then it was
determined that it was possible to overdrive the line cards on
digital switches to equalize them over a wider range of
frequencies, without smoking them down.  The newer modems take
advantage of this kludge.

Since the underlying digital data stream is eight thousand 8-bit
u-law samples per second, there are genuine theoretical limits in
terms of symbols per second which cannot be crossed.

Don't confuse "baud" in terms of characters per second through
your modem with the low level symbol rate of the modem's analog
output into the phone line.  The "baud" you see is a function not
only of the low level symbol rate, but of framing, the V.42
compression/error correction process, and other factors.

The price of ISDN is a function of phone company marketing, not
the cost of providing the service.  Domestic US service is almost
entirely digital now, and moving the subscriber line interface to
the consumer end, so the digital aspects of the network may be
fully exploited, is not a conceptually expensive process.

(Yes I know the software upgrade to ESS for ISDN costs a
bundle.)
