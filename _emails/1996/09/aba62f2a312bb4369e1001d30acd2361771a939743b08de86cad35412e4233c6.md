I was thinking of storing a reply-key in each remailer.  The protocol might
go something like this (straw man proposal):

(1) Alice picks n random ids (say 160 bits or so) and n random keys.
(2) Alice sends the combination <id[i], key[i]> to remailer[i], i=0,n-1.
(3) Alice builds a reply block which consists of the remailer return path,
each element encyphered with the appropriate key and sends it to Bob.
(4) When a remailer processes a reply block element, it removes it from the
reply block, looks up the id in its database, decrypts the address of the
next hop, removes the database element and forwards the message.

If Alice becomes nervous, she sends n "replys" thru each remailer to cause
the return path to be destroyed.
