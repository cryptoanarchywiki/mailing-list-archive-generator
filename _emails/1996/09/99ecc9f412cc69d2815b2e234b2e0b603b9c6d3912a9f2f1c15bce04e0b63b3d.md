This excerpt from a Wired article/interview
http://www.hotwired.com/wired/3.10/departments/electrosphere/data.html

"No data is totally safe," says Sharp, who runs his Data Recovery Labs from
the coincidentally named town of Safety Harbor,
Florida. "But you can recover data that's been overwritten up to nine times.
The only way to permanently remove data is with
programs that can do a 'severe security erase,' when the drive is
over-written 10 consecutive times." 


Believe it or don't!
