Noise?  Are you on drugs?  This is one of the relatively few _on-topic_
threads on this damned list these days!

If 1500 other folks can be made to give a try to the Jenaer Remailer
then this thread has served a very useful and salutary purpose.

I believe this was the problem; several of the remailers were choking
right when I was doing this experiment.  Indeed, I had to post my reply
to you here FOUR times through otherwise reliable remailers before it
ever showed up.

This is mechanically a sound suggestion, but I believe that it is a
primary security measure to avoid any direct contact with fresh remailer,
even using a waste account.

clueless messages in a.a.m is a nuisance, and you are surely right about
the vagaries of Usenet connectivity.

My first thought was to have them sent to a non-autopinging *.test ng
via a well-tested parsing mail2news gate, but some autopingers ping ALL
*.test traffic passing through a site.  If these ping messages didn't
get automatically bitbucketed at the remailer site, this could be a
problem for the operator.

Anyway, let's see what happens with today's tests...
