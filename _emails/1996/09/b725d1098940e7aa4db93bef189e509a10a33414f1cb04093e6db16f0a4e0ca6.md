Check out http://www.ssd.intel.com/tflop.html, where Intel is building
a 9000 Pentium Pro (200 MHz) machine for Sandia. Yes, it runs Unix,
and they've already delivered the first 64 processor node.

When finished, it will have 600Gbyte RAM, 200Tbyte disk, and run at
about 1.8 Tflops, and cover about 1600 square feet.

Price? 46 M$, or about $5k/processor.
