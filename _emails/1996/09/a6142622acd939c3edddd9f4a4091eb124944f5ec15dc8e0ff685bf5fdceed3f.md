Gee only 100 bad sites on the net out of thousands of web sites.  Looks
cleaner than a hound's tooth to me.  And Germany trying to block two sites a
year (but failing).  At that rate they'll really "shut 'er down."

Note the subtle problem.  With thousands of "bad sites" combined with
bureaucratic sloth the governments of the world are bailing with a teaspoon.
We ca put 'em up faster than they can knock them down particularly since
they can't knock them down at all.
