You urge us not to get into the argument about "just_when_violence is 
initiated" and proceed to state the "Mr. Bell...  ...*will* be 
initiating violence".  What is that english word?  Dogmatic?  Nahhh, 
there must be a more precise one.   Please help me here...

Looters of all persuasions have always counted on that and it worked 
for them for thousands of years.

You could worry all you want, but your only way to assess wether or 
not it will happens is not through your feelings but trhough the use 
of your rational mind.  Stop "feeling" and start thinking.

I suppose that this refers to AP.  If so, go RTFM because you 
conclusions and the workings of AP are not compatible.  AP would not 
lead to a war, per se.  Neither a civil war.

I urge you to have a look at what is at the root of the growth of 
govt.  It is not things but ideas, basic premises about life and the 
interaction between individuals.  Ultimately, basic premises about 
the nature of Man is what brought us more govt.

To understand govt excess, you've got to understand what is into the 
brain of the govt peoples.
