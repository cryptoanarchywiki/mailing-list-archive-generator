There are many nuanced definitions of "free speech." I was replying to
someone who used in connection with his belief that remailers primarily
exist as a service to enable "free speech." Hence my comment.

I'm fully aware of the rights of remailers to limit what they pass on. I
just don't think it wise, nor do I think it fits with pious calls for "free
speech."
