I've only spoken to Kelly Goen _once_ in many months, and he was calling
from his cellphone and we only talked for a few minutes. I don't recall
mentioning Vulis.

So, who are these "various people"?

Who are these "at least two other people"?

I _do_ think you're a loon. Not in the endearing sense of some net.loons,
but in the peculiar kind of foaming-at-the-mouth lunacy that I've seen in
several Russian and Armenian emigres.
