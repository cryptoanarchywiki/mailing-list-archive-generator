	Market? Wider distribution of such pictures will lead to _decreased_
production, for the simple reason that the producers won't be able to go to
courts for stopping copyright violations, so they can't make any money.
   
>   The ministers agreed to expand a working party that has already been

>   The group will include representatives of the 15 EU telecoms
>   ministries and of companies that provide access to online services or
>   prepare the content, a statement adopted by the ministers said.

>   British Science and Technology Minister Ian Taylor advocated a

>   Two British trade associations announced that an independent body, the

>   They said Internet service providers would also adopt policies for

	I suspect that any anonymous remailers operating in Britain may want
to look out for ISP interruptions...
