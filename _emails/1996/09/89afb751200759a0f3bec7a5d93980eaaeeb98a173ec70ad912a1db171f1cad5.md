I'm sure the sentense would have been different if she weren't a Slavic
untermensch, or if he were, say, a Turk.

A friend of mine related how his father - a Jew and a Soviet Army officer -
commanded a company in WW2. In 1944 they came across a church where over a 
thousand Nazi soldiers surrendered without reistance. He announced them "Ich
bin ain Jude" and had them all executed. I think he did the right thing.
