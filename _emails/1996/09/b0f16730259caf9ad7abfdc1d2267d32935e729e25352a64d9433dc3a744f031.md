That's the definition of a stream cipher.  BBS is rather slow and is dependant
on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.  Of course, if the keys are
distributed using RSA or Rabin, then the strength of the system depends on the
difficulty of factoring numbers anyway.  There are many stream ciphers that
are fast and secure.  I generally like to use a block cipher in CFB or OFB
mode rather than a stream cipher, but they are basically the same thing.
