Unfortunately, this means that Germany wins.

This will embolden Germany and other nations to apply similar pressures to
other ISPs.

While I don't fully understand the economic pressures the IP-traffic
blockage may have had on your site, it is sad that a user account has been
removed because some foreign government doesn't like it.

My recommendation is that you restore radikal 154's account immediately,
and post a message to all customers and on various Net forums indicating
you will not remove user accounts for materials which do not violate your
own national laws.
