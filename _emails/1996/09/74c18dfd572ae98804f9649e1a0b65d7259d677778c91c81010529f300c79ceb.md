Add to this these items:

-- the IBM GAK product

-- the "Clipper IV" (or is it only Clipper III?) GAK announcement expected
"soon"


It seems that several of these announcements are happening at the same
time, which I doubt is coincidental. As the Republican challenger (whose
name escapes me at the moment :-}) is not making an issue out of this, and
is not making any issues out of anything related to liberty issues as near
as I can tell, Clinton and the national security establishment seem to have
free rein (and reign) to deploy GAK>

As Lucky pointed out, GAK now appears inevitable. There's probably still
time to monkeywrench these schemes, though. A few Blaze- or
Wagner/Goldberg-type hacks could undermine confidence in the Key Authority
(not to be confused with the Port Authority, which I presume handles i/o
port assignments).
