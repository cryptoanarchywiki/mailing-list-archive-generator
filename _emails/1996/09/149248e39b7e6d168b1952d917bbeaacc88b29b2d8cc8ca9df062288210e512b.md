     I would assert that if children (ALL of them) had been thru a class
in the Hows and Whys of the constitution, rather than the glossing over 
that I remember, our government would be a lot different. I am not 
talking about _just_ an intense memorization of the document, but a 
reading of the federalist papers (which I still haven't gotten all the 
way thru) and a month or two of purely discussing and analyzing the 
document, the Feds couldn't get away with what they are doing. 

     I agree that students who aren't cut out for the academic life should
be incouraged to persue trades, or the arts (which IMO are simply trades,
and my degree will be a BFA when I finish that last Art History class) but
citizenship is _everyones_ responsibility, and there are too many people 
clamoring for laws & amendments without thinking, and without understanding
the process. Our schools are not turning out thinkers, and that is a (IMO)
a fatal flaw. 

     This is the OBCrypto part: For Crypto(in the sense of anonymity and
pseudoanonymity) to truely be accepted and appreciated by the "general 
public (yes, a vague term), they need to understand the history of anonymous
publications. They need to understand _why_ people should want to publish
anonymously.
     The other side is that for your "crypto-anarchy" to succeed, we need 
people who can understand things like "algorythms" and "mathmatical proofs".

     The rest of this is [NOISE].

     I have bought "work clothes"--collared shirts, trousers &etc--at 
SalAr, and my wife still does. She works for the Merc as a secretary. 
These many of these people are unwilling to do _anything_ to help themselves,
and it is the fault of everyone who ever handed them a dime. As one 
former listmember ranted one day "You know why there are beggars in this 
city?"..."Because people like you (not me, his partner) GIVE THEM MONEY".
People wouldn't beg if it got them nothing.

     Oops. You made that point.

     While I'd agree that this is true for many, I know some (me, my brother
and a couple of my cousins) that have done work like this more than once. 
Not that I would do that kind of work (for pay) today, unless I was _real_
desperate.

     Then again, it could be a family thing.

     I see no reason that general programming shouldn't be considered a 
trade. Maybe more "pure" math than a carpenter, or a mechanic, but they
don't need the english, general history, & etc. that other "academic" 
careers need.

     Cutting off hands is a little drastic. Too prone to false aqusations,
and too hard to erase if the courts are wrong. Three years at hard labor
on bare sustance would be about right tho', and if the aqusation is proved
false, it is erase from the record.

    People die for all manner of reasons every day. Fuck'em.
