Please unimbibe me, too!

I tried "unscrive," "unsuscrive," and "unscribe," and even "unsuckscribe,"
so now I'm trying "unimbibe."

Help, I'm trapped on this list and I can't unscrive from it!

(Of course, had I kept any of the many instructions that have been posted,
or the instructions I got when I got signed up, I would've known that the
correct way to "unsubscribe" is to send a message to "majordomo@toad.com"
with the body message of "unsubscribe cypherpunks".)

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
