I got a similar message from those idiots and replied off list (part of 
my email bomb, I guess).  There email is terrific -- save it for 
evidence.  They *admit* that they know you aren't doing what they are 
complaining about, but threaten to sue you anyway.

I hope there lawyers have read Civil Rule 11 ... on second thought, I 
hope they haven't!$$$$$!
