]>
]> Chase Manhattan Corp.'s auto financing division has begun using the
]> Internet to provide dealerships with loan-approval decisions. The bank
]> is the first of eight financial institutions that have committed to
]> using the system, developed by IBM Corp. By computerizing loan
]> applications and sending data electronically, Chase officials said the
]> bank can grant approvals in as few as two minutes. Up to 50% of the
]> division's auto loans will be running through the system within the
]> next 18 months. Chase, the largest car lender not affiliated with a car
]> company, is connected to six dealerships currently using the system and
]> will establish connections to 100 dealers with the official introduction
]> in October. Other financial institutions planning to use the on-line
]> system include NationsBank Corp., G.E. Capital Auto Financial Services
]> Inc., Regions Financial Corp., and Citibank Puerto Rico. The dealer's
]> computer is connected to the Internet through the IBM Globa l Network,
]> which is also used to retrieve an encrypted report from a credit bureau.
]> The dealer's pre-established "key" decodes the report and causes the
]> screen to display one, two, or three stars -- representing poor, fair,
]> or good credit. This gives the dealer an idea of which financial
]> institutions are most likely to approve the loan.
