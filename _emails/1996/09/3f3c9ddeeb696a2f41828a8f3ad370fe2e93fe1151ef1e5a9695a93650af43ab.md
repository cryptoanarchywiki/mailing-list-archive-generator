The Hippie Of Crime <robert@precipice.v-site.net>  also asked that
remailer operators not block HipCrime SPAM deliveries and all
mail to HipCrime because people might be interested in his
cool fractals and Java neural net lotto-predicters and anarchist pages.

If he wants to advertise to people about his other cool products,
he doesn't need to do it anonymously.  Furthermore, he doesn't provide
any method in his web pages for users to anonymously request information,
or to have information delivered anonymously.  So blocking him from
the remailers won't lose him anything.
