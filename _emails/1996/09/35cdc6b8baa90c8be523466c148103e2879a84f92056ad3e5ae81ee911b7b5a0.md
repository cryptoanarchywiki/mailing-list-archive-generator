I just want to add a comment about the "ethics of mandatory insurance".
If one were to assume that the state mandating insurance, seat belts, 
and so on was motivated by genuine concern for the people, then OK (if 
that's what you want to think).  OTOH, since the true motivations are 
not public knowledge (for the average person), and since some of these 
are things for which the police can check you out and inspect you more 
closely, they might be relevant after all, or at least as relevant as 
some of the other topics.
