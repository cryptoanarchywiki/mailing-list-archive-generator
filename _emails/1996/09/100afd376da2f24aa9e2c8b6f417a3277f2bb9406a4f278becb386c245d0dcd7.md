You have misinterpreted me or I was unclear.  I don't doubt that, at some 
point, the group of people who generally follow the rule of written law 
might skip over some of the more restrictive parts of that law to combat

measures"; I know you agree that such a response is logical and proper 
under the circumstances.  :-)
