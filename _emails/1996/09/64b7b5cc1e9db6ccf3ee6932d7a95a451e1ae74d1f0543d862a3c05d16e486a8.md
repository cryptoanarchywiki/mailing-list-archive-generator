The problem with your idea, Jack, is that any decent crypto algorithm
will change on average half the output bits when one bit of the key is
changed. In other words, by definition, if you can do this, the
algorithm isn't as strong as it should be.

However, you are correct that failures to meet this standard properly
can be found in some popular algorithms. You might want to read Biham
and Shamir's book on differential cryptanalysis for details.
