I proposed this very idea on Usenet a few weeks ago. Apparently the
folks who send out spam e-mail (DEMMA) like it very much. (They're not
masochists -- they don't want to mail people who'll mailbomb them right
back or complain to their postmasters or otherwise make their lives
miserable :-) Such a list should be maintained by a neutral third party,
not by one of the junk-mailers for two reasons: they can't really be
trusted, and their plugs get pulled all the time.

Note that I also proposed making freely available lists of people who
said they _do want to receive junk mail on various topics - to make
*selling* such lists meaningless.

I'll repost some excerpts from the Usenet thread to give you some idea
of what's been discussed already, and what kind of discussion it was.

A user asks a 'bot for a random cookie. The user e-mails the 'bot
the cookie (for authentication) and his preference for unsolicited commercial
junk e-mail: wants it, doesn't want it, or doesn't care

The 'bot maintains an FTP site with 2 compressed lists of e-mail addresses:
people who said they want junk e-mail and people who said they don't want
it. (No list for "don't care's" is needed.)

An advertiser preparing a mass e-mail campaign should take care not to
e-mail the addresses that don't want junk e-mail. (A mailing list scrubbing
tool should be provided.) Bothering people on this list would be a serious
net-abuse

On the other hand, sending unsolicited commercial e-mail to people who told
the 'bot they want it, or who haven't bothered to tell the 'bot
they don't want junk mail, is not net-abuse. Like it or not, if you post to
Usenet, you can expect junk e-mail coming your way. It's your responsibilty
to make it known that you don't want unsolicited commercial e-mail

Grubby's "brilliant proposal" isn't really Grubby's.  It's been made by
several spammers over the months.  Eg: Slaton.  Tyrell's InsideConnections.
The "Direct Email Marketing Association".

You sound proud of the fact that there's no mechanism for me to let Slaton
know that I don't want to receive unsolicited commercial e-mail?

>>It's particularly

>

Of course they can't now

There is no FTP site where a spammer can get (for free) the
list of addresses to which junk e-mail shouldn't be sent. Nor is there a
user-friendly way to add one's address to this "don't e-mail" list - yet

>Even when they've invented the "don't-mail" process themselves, they

Slaton&co shouldn't be the one maintaining the list of addresses that don't
want junk e-mail. A deamon should do it, and the service should be free.

By the way I don't recall Slaton asking anyone to pay for not being e-mailed.
Unless you provide a quote, I'll assume you made this up.

You haven't answered my question, Lues. If the list of e-mail addresses of
people who DON'T want junk e-mail is made available for _free for FTP,
together with a tool for spammers to scrub their mailing lists of these
addresses, and an easy way for anyone to add his or her address to this
list for _free, then how would Slaton _sell this list to anyone?
