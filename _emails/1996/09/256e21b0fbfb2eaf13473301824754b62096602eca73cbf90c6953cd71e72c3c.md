I'm trying to work out just what sort of confused idea is going on
here. Save the Children is an international charity that is based
in the UK. It is ultra respectable, Princess Ann being its president
and very active in that role (ie not merely titular). Its also 
a-political which it has to be for tax reasons and because otherwise 
the royals couldn't have anything to do with it.

Their main mission is sending food to Ethiopia and other famine
areas, development work etc. It is ultra-worthy stuff.

I think that a more rational explanation of the Dennys case is that
being weasels the Dennys management decided they needed some good PR
before the judgement brought them bad PR.

Its the consumers who create a market. If someone burgals your house and
I knowingly buy the stolen goods its a crime.
