No self-respecting Cypherpunk thinks the Antitrust Act and related acts are
worthy of enforcement.

(Think of how the technology we support will tend to allow new avenues for

unreadable secure communications with foreign competitors, and so on, all
things the Antitrust regulators are already growing worried about.)
