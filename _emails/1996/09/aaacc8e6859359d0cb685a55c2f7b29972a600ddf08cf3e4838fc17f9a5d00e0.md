The problem however, is that artificial selection maybe the only way to
select beneficial attributes at all. What is presently being selected
for in western societies is all the factors that lead to a lack of
practice or belief in birth control. I'll let the reader think for a
moment on just what those are. Perhaps we can also somehow test for and
abolish the "Catholic" gene?
