The data standard for differential corrections is called "RTCM-104", and 
it's the signal you input into differential-capable GPS receivers.  Boxes to 
generate RTCM-104 are probably relatively cheap, primarily needing a 
multi-channel GPS receiver and another processor for coding.  Differential 
corrections can, of course, be transmitted on any frequency you'd like, 
including frequency-hopping if you're really concerned about intercept.  
(which you won't be...)

Incidentally, GPS receivers are getting REALLY small these days, 
particularly for just the module-level products.  A size like about 1 inch 
by 2-inches is pretty close to state-of-the-art.  Power consumption is about 
3/4 watt.
