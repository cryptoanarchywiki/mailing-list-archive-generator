How long do you propose to carry on doing that? Soon, the others
in the newsgroups will be asking you very impolitely to stop,
just as you would if someone kept on and on posting such stuff to cypherpunks.

True, but Usenet only functions because it works most of the
time. To the extent we subvert this consensus, we damage Usenet,
make it less useful. It shouldn't happen that in trying to save
or spread Usenet, we have to destroy it...

There I'm with you -- I'm merely suggesting that you find a way
to protest Singapore's actions in a manner that would be less
objectionable to most Internet users, in Singapore and outside.

>The point of being sometimes "impolite" (*) is to "force their hand."

I never said anything about politeness -- the appropriateness I
was talking about was in the context of what the people posting
to a discussion group consider proper material for them to
receive, not what the government of Singapore thinks.

In any case, I think we may be slightly going off track as far as
the current Singapore problem is concerned. They are blocking
access to certain web sites from mid September -- Usenet isn't
part of the current discussion, far as I know.
