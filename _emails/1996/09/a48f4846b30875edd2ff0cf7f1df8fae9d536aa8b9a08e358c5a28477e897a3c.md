First of all, soldiers are just the little guys, like you and me, no 
more "Nazis" than "Communists" or whatever we Americans are in the eyes 
of the third world, etc.

Remember the Godfather scene where Al Pacino is walking through the town 
in Sicily and he says "where are all the men?"? You can "justify" 
revenge all you want, and what do you get? Honor? Justice?

You get a lot of dead people, and in the next generation, nobody gives a 
shit. Oh, they "continue" the mindless hatred of earlier generations, 
spurred on by (take your pick here), but you can't really connect the 
issues seamlessly across generations, unless you simplify them in the 
extreme, such as "starvation and deprivation are a causative factor in 
war", or some such thing. Economic opportunity is certainly a leading 
cause in war and genocide, i.e., in a "free" world society, it should be 
easier to remove a profit motive than to remove starvation, if you know 
what I mean, and I think you do.
