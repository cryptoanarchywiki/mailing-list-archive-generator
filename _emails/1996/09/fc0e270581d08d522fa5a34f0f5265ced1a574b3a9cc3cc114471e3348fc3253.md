Hi all,

A couple of articles from the UK Daily Telegraph may be of interest.

The earlier one "Codebreakers come clean" is about the upcoming
congference on cold war intelligence & mentions the continued
release of the NSA's Venona files 
(see http://www.nsa.gov:8080/docs/venona/venona.html)
The article is at:
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et/access?ac=116192744309&pg=//96/9/29/wspy29.html

The second is about the GCHQ (UK equivalent of NSA) releasing its
own Venona files in response to the NSA release.
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et/access?ac=116192744309&pg=//96/9/30/ngch30.html
These are being released into the public records office, but there is
no indication that they will appear on the net for the time being.

Sherry
