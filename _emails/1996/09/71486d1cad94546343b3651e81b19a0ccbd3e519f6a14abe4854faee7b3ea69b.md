Since the individual user would already be guilty of a crime, if he is 
using the remailer to conceal his crimes, the paragraph in question would
be fairly useless and irrelevant unless it had the meaning that Jim Bell
attributes to it.

I believe that judges have a policy of interpreting deliberately 
ambiguous statutes in whatever way makes the most sense.  The only 
sensible interpretation of Leahy's bill is that it criminalizes 
strong remailers, that it is intended to punish ANYONE, not just 
the criminals themselves, who obstructs investigations.
