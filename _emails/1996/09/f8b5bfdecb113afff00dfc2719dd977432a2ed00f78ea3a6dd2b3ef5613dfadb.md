Didn't you know that TCP/IP was an attempt by American Intelligence Agencies
in concert with Britain to impose Anglo-American values (free trade in goods
and bits) on the poor Mittel Europeans and the followers of Confucius in the
East.  These sinister British-American conspirators had done so well with
their earlier releases of blue jeans, Rock and Roll, and Coca Cola.  TCP/IP
was designed to be the final blow to Central Europe and Asia in a culture
ware that has dominated this century.

Pretty sneaky those Anglo Saxons.

"Course if Mittel Europeans and Confucians hadn't murdered 100 million
people or so in the 20th century, perhaps we could feel sorry for them."
(The US-UK alliance only murdered a few million mostly via mass bombing of
civilians during WWII.)
