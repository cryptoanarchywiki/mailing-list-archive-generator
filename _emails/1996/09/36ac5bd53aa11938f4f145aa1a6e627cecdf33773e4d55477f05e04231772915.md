| Isn't this vulnerable to "deadbeef" attacks? I can also see an attack when

	Yes its vulnerable.  I might see it in the logs, but I've
personally verified most of the keys I care about, and they carry my
signature, at least on my local keyring.

| *If* .outbound has some subdirectories (say subdir), How about this email: 
| 
| From: dumbass@aol.com
| Subject: GET subdir/../../../../etc/passwd
| Reply-To: blin@algebra.com

That will fail in the second subject line:
 * !^Subject:.*[ /.]\.
 Subject: does not match '/' or '.' followed by '.'

The first Subject: line prevents absolute pathnames.
 * ^Subject: (SEND|get) [0-9a-z][-_/0-9a-z.]+$

So, AFAIK, you can't get anything but real subdirectories.  Feel free
to install it on localhost & experiment.  I was pretty careful when I
wrote it to make it safe.
