]In NYC a very high percentage of drivers don't have licences, have suspended
]licences, etc. Generally no one has the time to bother with them unless they
]want to nail them for something else. A couple of years ago we were involved in
]a minor car accident with a Chassidic Jew who tried to leave the scene of the
]accident. My wife chased him and stopped him. :-) The cops came and discovered
]that he had no papers (including no driver's licence, no insurance, etc). They
]gave him about $500 worth of tickets for driving without a licence, leaving the
]scene of an accident, etc (which I rather doubt he was planning to pay) and let
]him drive on (still without the licence).

I received the following e-mail from either Timmy May using an alternate
account, or someone whose IQ is similar to Timmy's, in response:

Just now I received about 2 dozen similar e-mails from this address, which
therefore must be Timmy May's - I can't believe that there are two people on
the 'net this stupid and obnoxious and prone to lying. In particular, I receive
this spam from Timmy in response to each 'crypto-relevant wire clippings' post.

Timmy May is definitely turning this mailing list into a political rant
menagerie where cryptography discussions are not welcome.
