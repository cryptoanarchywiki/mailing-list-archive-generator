        Alright!   it's a genuine PerryGram!  I'll take the pledge; 
    I've never been able to answer Sternlight without being 
    significantly more offensive than usual!

=Look, folks, we all know that 99% of what David Sternlight posts is
=garbage. Why don't we all pledge not to answer any of his posts, and
=then he'll go away. If necessary, someone can be appointed to post a
=weekly "the views expressed by David are junk and we are deliberately
=not replying to them directly" message.

=David has plenty of places to argue with the wind. We don't need to
=add this one.

=I'd like to ask people to publically pledge that they will not reply
=to David's messages. This is such a pledge.
