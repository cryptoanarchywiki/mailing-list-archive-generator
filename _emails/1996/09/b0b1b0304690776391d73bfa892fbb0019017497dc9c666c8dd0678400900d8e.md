Could be. But prominent crypto atty. Ken Bass told me he thought such actions would be vigorously prosecuted - quicker than you could say "global proliferation." Thing to notice here: no prominent cryptographer in the US has come forth and said "yes, I helped write strong crypto abroad." Which isn't to say most of them aren't  traveling abroad frequently these days - take, e.g. the presence of M. Blaze, W. Diffie et al. at the OECD in Paris this week.
