My Ph.D. is in crypto and I've been monitoring the Cypherpunks mailing list
for a couple of years. I can attest that many of its regular, like Timothy C.
May, are censorous control freaks who are very much into suppressing any views
they don't like. Their harrassment includes sending hate e-mail via the
anonymous remailers, forging compromising messages (the way Tim May's been
attributing to me nonsense I've never said), postmaster complaints, etc. Many
recent threads on the list echo the news.groups/news.admin.net-abuse.misc
threads on how democratic votes on newsgroup election must be replaced by
Cabal decisions, how "spammers" can be better harrassed, etc. Most Cypherpunks
support the most reactionary and pro-censorship views on news.*. One can see
announcements like "There will be a physical cypherpunks meeting at [place].
[Person] will not be allowed in because I don't like his political views." In
particular, I've witnessed the recent harrassement of "hotcrime" by Tim May's
cybermob and was utterly disgusted, not for the first time. Here is one of the
e-mails that Tim May's latest victim sent to the Cypherpunks mailing list:

Despite the name, there's practically no crypto discussions on the list. A few
weeks ago someone mentioned elliptic curves, and there was an outcry of how
it's "off-topic". Instead the mailing list is flooded with rants and personal
attacks from Tim May, who knows next to nothing about cryptography, and whose
long-winded diatribes in support of child pornography, drugs, and Harry Browne
have absolutely no crypto relevance. Tim's off-topic spews have driven Eric
Hughes, John Gilmore, Rich Salz, and many other former valuable contributors
off the mailing list. Today's Cypherpunks don't write code - they write lies
and personal attacks. I'll quote a couple of Tim May's unprovoked personal
attacks against me to illustrate the kind of traffic found on the Cypherpunks
mailing list (as opposed to cryptography discussions):

I responded to Tom May stating that I've never called anybody a (t)churka (I'm
not even quite sure who or what they are) and asked him to retract his false
claims. Tim May never retracted, but continued to post more lies about me and
to attribute to me various nonsense I never wrote. But Tim May's attempts at
"character assassination" don't stop at the cypherpunks mailing list: recently
three separate people whom I respect (unlike Tim May) and who work in the
computer security field told me that Tim May has been complaining to them
"off-list" about my submissions to the Cypherpunks mailing list.

Here's another recent example of a personal attack Tim May posted to the list:

Again, Tim May is lying. I am not interested in "assassinating" his character.
He is the one spreading lies about me and attributing to me various nonsense I
never said. Tim May shows his true colors when he faults me for my defense of
Serdar Argic's freedom of speech. Unfortunately, Serdar has been silent for
over two years, but that doesn't stop censorous liars like Tim May from
continuing their vendetta against those who defended free speech.

We keep catching Tim May in major lies:

1. Tim May attributes to me things I never said.

2. Tim May was caught lying about Kelly Goen.

3. Tim May is lying about Detweiler. As far as I know, Detweiler never had any
problems with Eric Hughes et al, and Hughes doesn't have a problem with
Detweiler. The only person Detweiler has a problem with is Tim May. Detweiler
is 100% correct in saying that Tim May is an ignorant liar and a crook.

4. Sovok VZNuri is not Detweiler - even Tim May doesn't believe his own lies.

5. Archimedes (former Ludwig) Plutonium and Doctress Libby Neutopia know a lot
more about cryptography and are far more truthful than Timothy C. May.

_If it's true, then my reputation benefits from being slandered by the proven
liar Tim May.
