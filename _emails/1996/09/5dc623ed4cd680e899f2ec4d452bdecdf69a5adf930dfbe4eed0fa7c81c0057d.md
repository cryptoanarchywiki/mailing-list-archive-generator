But the U.S. is not a "free society". Tim yaks at those who criticize
his beloved United States for not being "polite". Tim is wrong.

I remember beig surprised to discover that the library computer at City
University of New York (state school where I got all my degrees) had an
(easily accessible) record of every book I've ever checked out in some
15 years, And by the way you need to present A LOT of ids to take books
out of New York's public libraries, or to use the public-access
computers in them. And by the way you're asked to sign your name and
affiliation (fortunately, no ID is required) if you want to just enter
NYPL's Slavic division and use their reading room. Apparently this was
instituted during the cold war under the assumption that anyone
interested in Slavic Division's materials needs to be watched.

Have you tried to get on an airplane lately? I just had to present my
driver licence (work id w/ picture wouldn't cut it!) to get on. I
understand John Gilmore got himself arrested for refusing to identify
himself. As he said, there used to be a 200-year precedent that a
citizen can travel within the country without having to identify
himself. Shit, I used to fly under phoney names - can't do this anymore.

A very good friend of mine does EE for a living, and in particular he
sells some EE equipment by mail order. He told me that every time he
sells something like the gizmo to write magnetic strips on credit cards,
he gets a phone call from los federales saying: you sold X who paid with
Y and shipped it to address Z - do you have any additional details? He
says every time they know as much about the sale as he does. :-)

That's why any time you attempt a cash transaction for over 10K (buying
a car, depositing it in a bank, etc), you will, by law, be reported to
the IRS, who will take a close look. I can't recall the name of the guy
who tried to take over 10K of cash out of the country without declaring
it, was searched, was caught, and is currently in jail.

As I told John Gilmore: I've known Esther Dyson for some time before she
got involved with EFF. I consider her a very nice person, and admire her
activities in Eastern Europe and elsewhere (and am in particular
thankful for her help on my past projects). I suspect that Esther simply
didn't think enough about this question before saying what she was
quoted as saying... I hope Esther will research the issue further, and
knowing her pro-liberty record, I'm sure she will see the value of
absoletely untraceable anonymity.

(Likewise I have great respect for Dr. Dorothy Denning, with whom I has
a very interesting conversation yesterday. She showed me cituations
where GAK (or generally employer access to keys) makes sense - not when
it's used by folks not affiliated with the government or the employer,
of course.)
