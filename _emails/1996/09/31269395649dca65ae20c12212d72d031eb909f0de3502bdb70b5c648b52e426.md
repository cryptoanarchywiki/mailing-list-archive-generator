Going into a bank can lead to casing out the joint, which may lead to
a heist.  Should this make the posession of pictures of banks illegal?

I don't think that anyone here is advocating kiddie porn.  The problem
that TCM pointed out is that in fighting kiddie porn, legislators
have started banning _thoughts_ that _could_ lead to child abuse.
This is one great leap forward into the police state.

You're seeing the trees and missing the forest.  It could be
any activity, say the abuse of animals, that winds up being
used as a wedge to create the police state.

If the government started tatooing red 'P's on the foreheads of
convicted pedophiles, would anyone notice the irony?
