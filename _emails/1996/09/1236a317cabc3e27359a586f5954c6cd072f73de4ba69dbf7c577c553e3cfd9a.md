	There's a difference between thinking something shouldn't be enforced
(e.g., drug laws for adults) and thinking that other things - such as privacy
and free speech - are more important than fully effective enforcement of
something (anti-terrorism measures, AntiTrust Act, etcetera). I don't think
that transparent houses, as Perry put it, should be required to prevent murders
- but I don't approve of murders either. It's a problem with means, not ends.
