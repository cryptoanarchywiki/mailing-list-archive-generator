Reputation performs this function very well, and without
expensive litigation. That is why there is really no clear and
present danger posed by inacurate information on the Net.

Governments shield themselves far better by promoting conspiracy
theory as a recreational activity than they ever could by
prosecuting people who expose their activities.  Drowning signal
in noise effectively obscures it without lending credence to
material one cannot easily debunk.

As they say on X-Files, "The Truth is Out There..." (Somewhere)
