Perhaps he's sending out through the remailers...because he can. Its open to
the public. Or perhaps he's trying to get the word out about remailers also,
or perhaps no one but he knows why, and why is unimportant. You can always
make your remailers a private, pay per use club. Then you could control all
the *whys* *whens* and *hows*.

These people have invited the email, and the associated expense, by placing
a public email-to: button on their public www page. A more acurate analogy,
and to the point, would be if a business sends you a postage pre-paid
business reply card, that is blank, and invites your comments on the card.
They can hardly complain of the expense when people actually send it in,
even if they don't like the comments.

Seems anyone who followed the link can complain to the appropriate source.

Didn't see any disclaimers on the remailers requiring a *good reason* to use
them. Who would be this Judge of Sufficiently Good Reason? Perhaps you can
write an AI piece that can auto-detect good reason from *no good reason*...

What is the ratio of *pissed off people* to not pissed off people. Likely
less than 0.5% based on how many messages the Cpunks claim went out in a day.

Now now... forgery is a no-no. And someone always has the freedom to give up
their anonymity whenever they choose.
