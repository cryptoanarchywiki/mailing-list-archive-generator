Not necessarily.  The answering machine at the phone number listed mentions
"RPK" as the company, and this company has non-Grady reasons for looking for
these skills.

>From their web page at http://crypto.swdev.co.nz/:
"The RPK public key cryptosystem provides industrial-strength public key
cryptography that's available worldwide. "

"You'll find full technical information, free evaluation software and
development tools, and details of our SafeCracker Challenge program where you
can earn a $$$ REWARD $$$ while trying to put us out of business! "

They could just be looking for people to test their own stuff.
