It's been a bad spam day.  If someone offered me a switch that
would separate academicians from AOLers, I would throw it.

That doesn't necessarily mean I would leave it in the "ON"

correct Cypherpunks approach to the problem.

Mr. Duvos, like other humans with Net fatigue, is occasionally
not in good humour.
