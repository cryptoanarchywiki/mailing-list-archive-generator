A problem here is that the *same* services and capabilities that permit 
anonymous speech in private permit anonymous speech in public. 
Compromising the latter compromises the former as well.

Unless chaining of remailers is made manadatory and automatic, this is 
unlikely to work. CoS had little difficulty getting anon.penet.fi's logs, 
and getting a preliminary ruling against online anonymity from the 
Finnish courts.

You have to have an anonymizing system that crosses a dozen or so 
national boundaries to make such an attack infeasible for most large 
organizations.  You'd need a system that crossed 50 or more widely 
disparate jurisdictions to make it infeasible to large intelligence or 
law enforcement agencies, and even then you'd have to NOT have broad 
international agreements, such as you'd called for or it would be trivial 
to force all the remailers in the chain to cough up personally 
identifiable information.

That's what bugs me - if there are some kind of sanctions coming from a 
governmental body (I may be misinterpreting you here), that's probably 
enough to kill private and well as public anonymity on the Net.

Incidentally, if something does happen from a governmental direction to 
kill online anonymity, it will probably be readily broadenable to all 
other media.
