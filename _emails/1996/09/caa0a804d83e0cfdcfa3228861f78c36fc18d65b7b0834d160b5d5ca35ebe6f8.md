	Those are very hard to figure out in advance.

	Silicon Valley, for one, developed because the government 
	closed several military facilities there.   Other examples
	do exist.   << I think it was CATO that published a paper

	However, such development does not occur, when local government
	authorities do not permit it to happen -- which is the usual 
	state of affairs.  <<  Can a simulation program put cover the
	situation where a government cries out for more development,
	and then prohibits it?  That is exactly what most city governments
	do, and some state governments are starting to do.  >>

	The average voter doesn't see any further than the bribe s/he 
	is paid by whichever criminal is trying to inflict his/her 
	mode of destruction on them, come the second tuesday of november.
