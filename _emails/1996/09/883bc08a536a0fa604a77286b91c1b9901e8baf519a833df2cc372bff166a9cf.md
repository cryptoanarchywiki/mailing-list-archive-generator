Since red liquid running in the streets is generally so reviled, one of the 
things which mystifies me is why there aren't more simulation-type programs 
used to test out hypotheticals, for example a "SimEconomy."   For example, 
you'll occasionally hear about a media news organization gathering a dozen 
or so volunteers in a room, and asking them to solve a problem like "The 
Budget Deficit" or some such.   The result of their interplay is generally 
used to explain why these problems are hard to solve.

I, for one, would love to be able to program in an immediate 25%+ reduction 
in military spending (added to that a 5%/year cumulative cut after that for 
10+ years), a 5% cut then a cap on Socialist Insecurity, 5% per year 
(cumulative,for 10 years) of reduction in welfare, along with similarly 
substantial cuts/caps in Medicare and a few other features.  Obviously, a 
computer-based simulation wouldn't just blindly do the cuts, but would also 
estimate the secondary and tertiary effects of such cuts, for example 
spending in areas whose economies are traditionally dependant on defense 
programs, etc.  

I'm not saying that I think these changes would be _easy_, politically, but 
if the average citizen were made aware of how simple the changes were, he'd 
be less tolerant of special-interest politics.

I hope you don't expect me to argue with this  B^)
