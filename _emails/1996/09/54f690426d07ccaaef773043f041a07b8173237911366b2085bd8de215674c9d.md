I think you're under a mis-impression here.  At least in the libertarian 
circles where I do most of my political discussion, it is generally 
suspected that corporations grow large and powerful primarily BECAUSE OF 
assistance by and due to the policies of government.  (heavy regulation 
favors large companies by keeping down small competitors, etc)  Of course, 
that cause/effect relationship is intentionally hidden, and most of the 
public sees the show put on which appears to have the opposite effect:  
Anti-trust lawsuits, etc.  

Over time, the public is gulled into the false belief that if you get rid of 
the government, you get rid of the "only think that stands between us and 
the multi-national corporations."  They believe this because the only 
government actions they see and recognize are anti-corporation.  If they 
were aware of the truth, they'd realize that these large corporations are 
actually afraid of a free market, and that the companies consider big 
government to be their friends..

Just look at an excellent example:  Intel versus IBM.  Intel used to be this 
tiny upstart chip company from the Bay area and IBM was smokestack America.  
Now, Intel is the biggest (by dollar volume, anyway) chip company in the 
world and IBM is, well, considerably cut back from its heyday.  At least in 
hindsight, IBM would have been "smart" to squash Intel, or buy it up, or 
have the government over-regulate it.
