Not true.  The late Soviet Union tried asking emigrants to pay for their
higher education (i.e. college and graduate school), not the secondary
education, medical care, and other substantial costs borne by the society.
They did it as an experiment for, I think, less than a year, and stopped
because of the whining from the United States (the primary benefitiary
of the free Soviet education, whatever it was worth).

The U.S. does things the former Soviet Union would never have thought of.
