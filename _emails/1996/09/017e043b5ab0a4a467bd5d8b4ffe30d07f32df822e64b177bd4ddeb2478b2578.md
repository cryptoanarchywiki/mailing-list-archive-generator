I agree. In times like this, they should be warning the public! The
overload was caused by Zeta Reticulans draining more power from the grid

Clinton dispatched _three_ of his Black Helicopters to Area 51, and they

We on the Doom13/D&D/Cypherpunks list are wise to their wayz, and their
warez, and will issue aluminum foil helmets to all those in danger.
