I agree, hence my original post. I for one would not contribute to such
a list without anonymity, tho my critiques might be right. The hassle of
dealing with a person or organization bent on causing you legal headache
is more than I am willing to deal with. It is obvious, given the current 
state of the legal system in this country, that a lawsuit against a
even a well-respected cryptographer might drag on for some time, costing 
ennumerable dollars and hours, and _might_ even succeed.
