It is an admission against interest and a confession; it is admissible 
against the speaker in a prosecution against him for "exporting crypto"
from a strictly evidentiary standpoint.

Your understanding of evidence is inaccurate.  The evidence re the 
laptop[s] would be admissible and the parties would argue about what it 
meant.  The jury is entitled to draw common sense inferences.  That might 
be easy to do in a case in which a defendant has confessed....

So now you, as your own lawyer (apparently) have decided to take the 
stand and testify.  Remember that the prosecutor gets to cross-examine 
you.  Things are about to get ugly....

Circumstantial evidence is admissible if probative of a fact at issue in 
the case.  Evidence that you took a laptop out of the country is 
probative of the allegation that you exported crypto using a laptop.

And your understanding of evidence shows a misunderstanding of how the 
rules of evidence actually work in a courtroom.

You are absolutely wrong.  It may not be enough for a conviction, but it 
will beat a Rule 29 motion (Motion for a judgment of acquittal) and get 
the case to the jury.

Must a jury believe that you were "just bragging" because you now, in a 
criminal trial, say that you were?

Perry Mason is only active in re-runs.

That's where prosecutorial discretion comes in and a judge's and jury's 
common sense comes in if the prosecutor runs amok.

BTW, I am far more willing to believe you were bragging about whacking 
Jimmy Hoffa than about exporting crypto.  Think of all the interesting 
evidence from this mailing list's archives that prosecutors would attempt 
to introduce against you ...

Not to say that *I* couldn't get you off, but not the way you propose.
