I respectfully disagree. I spend most of my time going through sites like
cnn.com, hotwired.com, news.com, altavista.digital.com, yahoo.com,
lycos.com, hotbot.com, eff.org, well.com, mit.edu, whitehouse.gov, and so
on. Search engines and directories, in particular, are good chokepoints to
block.

Blocking 100 sites would certainly be significant to me -- as long as
they're the right ones. Before the technical fixes, that is.
