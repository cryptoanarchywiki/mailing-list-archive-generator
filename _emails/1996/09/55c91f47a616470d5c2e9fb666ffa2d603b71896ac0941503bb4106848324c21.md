But Gary, don't you see that's good? We need to get laws *back* against 
witches, against fugitive slaves, against forming unions, against drinking 
alcohol, etc. and truth certainly shouldn't be an absolute defense against 
libel! "Our" country is slowly lapsing into anarchy, and would likely go 
even further if we didn't have the moral Exons, Packwoods, Clintons, and 
Rostenkowskis to lead us and protect us!
