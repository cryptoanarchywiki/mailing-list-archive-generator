One way to limit or retaliate against diffamation would be to refuse 
internet access to anybody known to be part of any such medias, being 
tv or paper.

ISPs would probably easily agree since the revenues coming from
journalists vs from the general population is probably minuscule. Of
course, the conventionnal media would set up their own ISP but they
could be identified.

Does that makes sense or am I out to lunch?
