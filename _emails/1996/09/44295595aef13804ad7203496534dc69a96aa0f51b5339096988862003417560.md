Now, now, let's not overreact. I named this thread, and yet I think even I
was going too far. That is, I was just making the point that Phill's call
for us to write denunciations or he would write an essay linking
libertarians and cypherpunks to AP smacked to me of a kind of extortion.

Any, I had several e-mail exchanges (in private) with Phill on this
subject, and I hardly think he's a "thoroughly lousy human being."

I disagree with many of his political beliefs, he no doubt disagrees with
many of mine (and even "ours," collectively), and in this particular case,
his "extortion" was a mistake.

I say we move on.
