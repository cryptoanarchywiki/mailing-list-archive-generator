No, I wouldn't be willing to pay $50.00 to have sent that message to
cypherpunks.  But I would certainly have been willing to pay some smaller
non-zero amount, like a dollar (and then there is the question of the
entities I blind copied it to ...).  But I never claimed that charging was
the answer to everying or compatible with the cypherpunks anarchy.  It just
seems like a useful tool to have available.  Based on (hopefully secure)
message characteristics, you want to encourage some mail and probably give it
extra priority, other mail you might want to charge a penny or two for, and
known junk sources you want to charge as much as you can and then trash the
mail.  Probably remailers should sign messages so you can easily configure to
let their mail in if you want to get it.  But there should still be 
appropriate social and legal action against network abusers as well.
