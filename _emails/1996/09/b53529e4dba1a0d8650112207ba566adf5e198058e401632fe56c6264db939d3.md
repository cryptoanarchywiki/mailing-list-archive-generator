However, one can also prepare in the traditional way by having friends and
family.  If you have same, you will always have enough to eat and someone
to take care of you (and also to kick you in the ass when you need it.

Somewhat actuarily unsound however.  If "the welfare" or SS were private
charities or insurance schemes, their management would be in prison for
self-dealing and fraud because of the high overhead of welfare and the
Ponzi scheme nature of SS.

Note too the recent article in the Economist about how European firms are
raising capital in the UK and the US because it is available there in
private pension savings while European government retirement systems suck
loads of capital out of the system leaving nothing but massive government
debts.
