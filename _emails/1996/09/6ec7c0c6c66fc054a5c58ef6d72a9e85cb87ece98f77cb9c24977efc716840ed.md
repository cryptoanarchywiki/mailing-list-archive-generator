     Having been a firefighter for about 4 years, I can say that for 
small fires water works quite a bit better. For larger fires (over a
hundred acres or so) setting a backfire, or burning out the fuel in the
direction the fire is probably going to go is a hell of a lot easier than
hauling millons and millions of gallons or blood^h^h^h^h^h water.
