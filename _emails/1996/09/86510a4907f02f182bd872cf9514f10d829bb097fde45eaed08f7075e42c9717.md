Correct. And if "we" fund universal service, then "we" don't want to see
anything on the Net about non-GAK crypto, the right to bear arms, freedom of
association, chemistry, non-clothed persons, taxes, etc. etc.  "We" feel
that many if not "all American, but especially kids in classrooms" would be
injured by these thoughts.
