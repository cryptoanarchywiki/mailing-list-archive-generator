Beware Geeks bearing gifts 
 
 
 The Internet is well known as a pioneer when it comes to technology. Less
noticed is its role 
 on the cutting edge of management fashion. Nowadays, it is fashionable for
firms to 
 "outsource" product development to just about everybody. Leading Internet

 developed this method a stage further: they have found an outside supplier
so keen to tender 
 his services that he is sometimes willing to pay for the privilege. The
name of this fool? The 
 consumer. [More on beta-scamming at the URL.]
