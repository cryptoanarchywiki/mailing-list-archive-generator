Freedom of speech is a poor excuse for junk email. There are few absolute
freedoms in any society, and those that exercise their "freedom" to the
point of abusing their fellows are those who cause such freedoms to become
more restricted. I'm personally against needing to pay the social costs of
more and more laws because someone is trying to make a buck any way he
can, regardless of the costs and annoyances to others.

Hitting the DELETE key once in a while is not the problem. Inequitable 
division of the costs is a problem. The aggravation of seeing something 
good being slowly eroded is a problem. People who feel that they have 
"rights" and "freedoms" with no concept of the social responsibility that 
creates and protects such intangibles are a problem.

And how much could be saved if we did away with both? Could we end world 
hunger if spammers were converted to soylent green?

Telemarketing (even at at dinner time) is widespread. So is junk snail-mail. 
How socialy acceptable these behaviors are is debatable.

Junk faxing was a blessedly short term fad, one that had to be legislated 
away.

I'm completely in favor of allowing junk email, as long as "JUNK MAIL" is 
required to be the first thing on the subject line. PLONK!   ... but that 
will take yet another law ... 

- r.w.
