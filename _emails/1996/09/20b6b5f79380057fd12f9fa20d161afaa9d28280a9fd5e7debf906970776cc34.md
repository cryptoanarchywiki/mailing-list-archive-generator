***** MEDIA ADVISORY RE LAUNCH OF NATIONAL NETDAY *****

WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Government officials are joining business and
community leaders in kicking off national NetDay 96 to wire all K-12 public
and private schools in more than 40 states for access to the information
superhighway.  Businesses, parents, educators, students and
community volunteers will come together to wire more than 20,000
schools nationwide.

     Larry Irving, assistant secretary of Commerce for
communications and information, will join U.S. Education Secretary
Richard W. Riley to help lauch national NetDay 96.  Irving's remarks will
focus on the need to make sure that all of America's communities
participate in this effort.  "We can't afford to leave some of our schools
behind -- all of our children deserve access to the tools that will enable
them to be full participants in the Information Age," said Irving.

     WHO:     U.S. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley
              Assistant Secretary of Commerce Larry Irving
              NetDay Co-Founder John Gage of Sun Microsystems
              Robert Goodwin, Points of Light Foundation
              Corporate Partners, including BellSouth, Cisco Systems,
                  MCI, Apple, AT&T, and others.

     WHEN:   Thursday, September 26, 1:15 p.m.

     WHERE:  Hine Junior High School
             8th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, SE

     Like California NetDay, national NetDay 96 will follow the classic
barn-raising tradition.  It will build on California NetDay, in which more
than 20,000 volunteers came together in March 1996 to connect over
2,600 schools to the Internet.

     For more information, please call Anna Erdreich, U.S. Department
of Education, 202-401-4389, or Paige Darden, Department of Commerce's
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), at
