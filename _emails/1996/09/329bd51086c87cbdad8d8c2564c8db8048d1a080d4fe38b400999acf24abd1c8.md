Certainly not throwing out the principle of double jeopardy, that a man
should only be tried once for the same alleged crime. As for my "remedy,"
not all injustices can be righted.

(The O.J. trial was a case of a mostly-black jury refusing to convict an
obviously guilty black defendant....and yet I don't hear calls for a
_second_ criminal trial.)

As for the historical reasons for the "conspiracy to not take seriously the
civil rights of an aggrieved minority" nonsense, isn't it about time to
roll back such laws? Whatever the putative justification for such things
might have been 30-40 years ago, this is now, that was then.
