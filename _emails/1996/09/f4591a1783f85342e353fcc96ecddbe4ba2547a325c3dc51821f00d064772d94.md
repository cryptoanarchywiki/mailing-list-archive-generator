"If there were no other reason to homeschool your children, protecting them
from the 'valuable social atmosphere' of the schools would be sufficient."  

John was a commie liberal BTW.  He felt that the schools had a very nasty
and artificial social environment with rigid age segregation that bore no
resemblance to real life where there are people of wider age ranges.
Certainly, most people suffer worse mistreatment from their "peers" at
school than they do later in life.     

As a libertarian, I would add that the social atmosphere of a Stalinist
"brain factory" is not exactly the socialization I would choose for my
children.  I would choose a more market oriented model.

government schools teaches State supremacy."
