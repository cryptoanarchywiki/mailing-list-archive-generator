Nonsense. Japanese students were not taking the CEEB and SAT tests in the
1950s, when the test methodologies were established. (As a point of fact,
the Japanese have their own grueling exams, which bear no resemblance to
the CEEB and SAT tests.) Nor were the number of Japanese-American students
taking the test sufficiently plentiful in the 1950s and 60s to affect the
methodology.

So, this is your chance to present your evidence that the scoring
methodology was changed in response to Japanese students doing better than
American students.
