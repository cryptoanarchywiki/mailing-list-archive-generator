This message has nothing to do with the subject of this mailing list,
which is as 
stated in the Information File which you should have read, Encryption and
other 
related issues. Your actions have been a nuisance, and you should cease
your 
message writing endeavor. In regards to your message, have him write
messages 
to you stating how he thinks you should stop writing to him, and how he
doesn't need
e-mail anyways.
