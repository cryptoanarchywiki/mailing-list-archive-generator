My comment: Once the big Corp.'s get used to the new game, they'll put 
the non-critical stuff out there for Mr. Freeh, and for the really 
secret data, if the cops confiscate anything they can't read, the Corp. 
security will put it off on a fall-guy, even as high as the CEO if 
necessary. I just wanna see one case where a federal judge will try to 
bleed a big company for contempt for "refusing" to decode and hand over 
some ostensibly encrypted data. Matter of fact, there are probably cases 
similar to this that have already been through the appeals courts.
