I believe there is one section in the Constitution that says that speech
harmful to national security is not protected under the 1st amendment.  However,
I don't agree with this provision at all.  "National security" is a phrase that
is applied to anything from information on the JFK assassination to DES source
code.

If secret information was released, it would cause most people to completely
lose respect for the government (some people call this damage -- I call it
progress).

There may be certain circumstances under which speech can be directly harmful.
Military operations and missle launch codes are things that should be kept
secret.  Information about high-powered weapons should be too.  If the Japanese
had been able to get information about how to build A-bombs during WWII, major
cities in the U.S. probably would have been completely wiped out.  I don't like
the idea that the government has the power to decide what's harmful and what
isn't, but there are beneficial uses of the provision.
