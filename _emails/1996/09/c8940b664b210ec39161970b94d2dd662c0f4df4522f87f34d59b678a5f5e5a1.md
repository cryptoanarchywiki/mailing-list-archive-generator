First off, what does this have to do with cryptography?  or anything 
cypher for that matter?

So, basically your saying, since my parents cannot afford to pay for a 
private school for me, we are genetically inferior to those who can?
Because hate tell ya, but I've ran into some major idiots that go to 
private schools.  Also to consider that from the school I go to, last 
year we had two perfect sat scores (no problems missed).

I am assuming from what you have said in that statement, that you believe 
since he may have gone to a public school, it has made him have the 
opinion he does?
Also, in your statement that your older kid goes to a private school, and 
that the parents are obviously genetically superior to public school 
parents.  You seem to be saying that YOU are genetically superior to my 
parents?
Another thing to consider here is, from this line of statements, you are 
saying that children who have parents who made it well in, let us say the 
movie buisness (or even drug buisness), and then send there children to 
public schools, are genetically superior because they can act (lie) 
better than my parents.  For if this is so, that must mean that my aunt 
is genetically superior to my mother (who is a teacher at a private 
school, but she did not go to a private school) and to her parents, for 
she is making more money, and if she ever has children they will be 
genetically superior to me, because they will have more money?
Just wanting this cleared up please..  It kind of confuses poor little 
'ol me who is jsut a lousy senior in a public school (and scored 1560 on 
my SAT, as if that means anything, just means I have a good memory), 
since from what you say I must be stupid, because my parents only make 
50 to 60k$ per year between the two of them (My father being an AutoCad 
Design Consultant, and my Mother a LD (Learning disabled) Teacher at a 
public school)?

True, but also depends on where you are at.  Some states have cheaper 
taxes (Nevada for instance), compared to others.

Hate to inform you on this but, it is more often than not the children 
sent by there rich mama and papa to school, that end up on drugs or as 
drug dealers, than the ones that start out with scholarships (For the 
ones with scholarships have more to loose, than the ones with the rich 
mama and papa, for the rich mama and papa can afford the big expensive 
lawyer.).  Just look at the studies and such done on this type of area.  
Also you have to consider that generally the ones that end up as drug 
dealers, are the children who have parents that where drug dealers and 
such or had experience in such, or just had parents who didn't care what 
they did.



Ok, now back to something crypto related ok?  Though I am rather 
interested in this subject.


Boy oh boy, someone has a opssibly inferiority complex here...
