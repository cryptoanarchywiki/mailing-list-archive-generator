And meat tenderizers would be outlawed, because it would be viewed as an
effort to obscure the markings.  (You could be sent to jail for beating
your meat!)

Think of the legal liability for selling someone meat that is later
involved with the drug trade!  The way the laws are going, you could lose
everything for selling a steak to a known drug user.  Soon you would have
meat market laws similar to the alcohol laws in Utah.  You will have to eat
the steak on the premises, in front of a government authorized and licensed
vendor.  (Until the cholesterol police make meat consumption a crime.)

Soon we will have gangs fighting over the illegal meat trade.  Meat will be
murder!  Instead of "drive-ins", we will have "drive-bys".  Government will
have an even bigger reason to put a steak through our civil rights.  Our
goose will be cooked!

Then people will go to trading vegetables and grain.  And all the "honest
folks" will be left with nothing to eat but rocks.  (Until, those too are
banned because someone might throw one...)
