Yes, he does, I think.  But I think "protected" above should read 
"prohibited."  [Note to Greg: could that be a typo?]  The key kiddie 
porn/1st amendment case (whose name escapes 
me for the moment) offered two reasons why kiddie porn could be regulated 
in the face of the first amendment.  One reason was the "on-going trauma to 
the child [victim]."In a morphed image, they is not (or at least may not be) 
an actual child victim.  Thus the "continuing trauma" rationale for 
regulation does not exist in that case.

Different standards frequently apply to adults and children, in spite of 
those of you who like to arm your toddlers!  :-)

> What about the "ongoing trauma" to the adults?  I smell hypocrisy.

Adults, for the most part, are supposed to take care of themselves.
