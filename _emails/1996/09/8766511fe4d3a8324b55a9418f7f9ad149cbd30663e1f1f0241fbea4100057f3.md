Non-sequiteur.

Non sequiteur. You're not responding to my point, which is a moral 
criticism of the tone of statements like

which seem to oversimplify matters for corporations like AOL. Of course
AOL
can repeat statements like these to its customers until it was blue in
the 
face, but the good news is that their customers could vote with their
feet. 
My criticism of your statement is that it an aethetically ugly and
hippocritical position to take, if one purports to provide mail services 
to hundreds of thousands of customers, or purports not to engage in 
editorial control, or purports to promote free speech. If ISP's want
to provide services subject to arbitary limitations fine ... I am
stating that
I find this practice deplorable, and I have not implied that I favor
government
regulation to correct such situations, as much as you want to believe
that I have.

None.

That's an overinterpretation of my words.
