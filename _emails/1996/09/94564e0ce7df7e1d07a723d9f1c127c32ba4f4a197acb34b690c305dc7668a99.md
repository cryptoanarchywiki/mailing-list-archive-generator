It's particularly funny when you consider that the main justification for
suppression is that insurgents (or rebels or freedom fighters or ...) kill
people. Something along the lines of "We don't suppress unpopular views;
we're just protecting our citizens".   Now, it seems to me that that having a
web page is a decidely non-lethal thing. <g>  OTOH, it's probably more
effective at getting the outside world to find out what's happening.  Draw
your own conclusions.
