Hey, I'm a candidate for President, too (at least I know of someone who
plans to vote for me). Does this mean I am protected against various
threats, and veiled threats? Let me know, as I seem to be under attack by
certain Russian-developed spambots.

More seriously, the whole set of protections the President has is
inconsistent with our nominally anti-royalist approach. Of course, America
long ago created its own royalty. Even dynasties (how else do you explain
Teddy Kennedy getting away with the Mary Jo Kopechne thing?).

Actively (and plausibly) threatening _anyone_ is a kind of crime (*), but
there is no reason to make special laws covering certain persons.

(* Why do I say "actively (and plausibly) threatening _anyone_ is a kind of
crime"? Don't I believe in free speech? Well, if I hear that Vladimir G.
Nulis says I should be killed, and that he is coming to California to take
care of this, I have no compunctions, liberrarian or otherwise, about
shooting first at the first sign of his appearance on my property.
Understandably, the government does not wish this to happen. Thus, I have
no problem with illegalizing direct and concrete threats. General threats,
such as "all lawyers should be taken out into the parking lot and garotted"
are not specific, direct, and concrete, and hence fall under the free
speech provisions.)
