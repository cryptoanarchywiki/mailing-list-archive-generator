Is Timmy gay?  Why does he hate women so much?

Recently, 3 people in the computer security field have independently
told me that Timmy May approached them "off-list" to complain about
things I supposedly say on the Internet - most of which I never said.
When I asked about it on this mailing list, Timmy posted what was shown
to be a lie (about his complaint to Kelly Goen.) Timmy is known as a
nutcase and a liar - if he keeps up his "character assassination"
attacks, the only reputation he hurts is his own.
