The most basic principle is this: those with resources they control (and
"own") set the rates and policies.

We don't have to figure out how the pricing will ripple down the line, or
whether what some call "spam" will be controlled.

(My view is that the whole focus on "spam" has been singularly unfruitful.
We don't call magazine or television advertising "spam," though it meets
operational definitions of spam, or velveeta, or whatever the latest terms
is. While much advertising is disgusting, unwanted, noisome, etc., we
understand that the publisher of a magazine can choose what to include and
we can choose whether to buy it or not. (Television and radio are somewhat
different, due to the FCC licensing and limited bandwidth, but the
principle is the same.))

Thus, when carriers of packet traffic begin market pricing of packets, the
pricing will ripple back. Eventually. (Or not, should some steps in the
chain decide not to pass on costs...)

I expect the failure of the Internet to have proper conservation laws to be
solved in this way:

Removal of Market Distortions + Auctioning Mechanisms + Several Large
Network Crashes = A More Rational Market Model for Network Usage
