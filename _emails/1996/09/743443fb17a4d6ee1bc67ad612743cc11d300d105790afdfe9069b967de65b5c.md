Seriously, how may of the 28.8 modem users get connections at 28.8? 
Twenty percent? Fifty percent? Today's modems are already faster than 
most analog lines can support. More likely than not, a 56k modem won't 
link up at 56k. If you want speed, use the clean solution. Get ISDN.

[And don't buy the Motorola BitSurfer PRO. It won't work with two line
phones. The sound is so bad, you can't use the POTS you pull out for
business.  Motorola: "We are aware of the problem". Well, they have been
aware of it since at least February.]

But for data, home ISDN is the way to go.
