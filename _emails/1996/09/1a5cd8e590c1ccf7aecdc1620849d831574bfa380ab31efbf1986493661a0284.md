Looks like another snake oil peddler.

Look, Mr. Walker:

Either you are a marketing type, in which case I suspect you have no idea
what you are peddling, you are a techncal type, in which case you are
deceiving us, or you don't really know what you are doing, in which case
you are making representations without the benefit of knowledge.

In any of these cases, you are, it seems to me, peddling garbage.

Crypto, for some reason, seems to be at the level of hair tonic when it
comes to hype advertizing making up for 0 in product quality.

Any attorney who knew anything would have that suit laughed out of court.

If he sues in D.C. come see me.
