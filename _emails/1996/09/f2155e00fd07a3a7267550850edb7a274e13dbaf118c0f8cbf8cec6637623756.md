Culturing and growing anthrax is painfully simple.  No DNA required.

Incorrect.  It is highly problematic and very nasty when it is properly
delivered.  The hardest thing about anthrax is to get an areosol fine
enough to present an inhalation risk.  (This is why it does not
generally cause problems in humans- it's rare for it to get this fine).
