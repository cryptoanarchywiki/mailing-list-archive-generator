Sure, it's always less hassle doing what they want.  Privacy doesn't
come for free.  It's easier to let the police search you in the street
than it is to make them arrest you so that you can make a formal
complaint.

So?  My passport reads "let the bearer travel without let or hindrance"
- yet I still get enormous grief every time I enter the country that
issued it.

Hmm - who are you paraphrasing here? (Just curious).

Or widespread disinformation - don't stand up for your "right" not to
disclose your SSN - simply give them one with errors in - that way their
whole database starts to lose value.
