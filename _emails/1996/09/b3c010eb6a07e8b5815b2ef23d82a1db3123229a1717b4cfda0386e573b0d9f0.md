Actually, if you use only a few bits - and not, say, bit 15 of *every* pixel -
you can feel secure *IF* you are writing truly encrypted data.  A regular PGP
message has a bunch of header material that most certainly is not
random-looking.  OTOH, if you only write the raw data, then there is no way to
differentiate from the random noise added by any scanner - in most cases, the
last couple bits in each RGB triplet of a truecolor image are random.
