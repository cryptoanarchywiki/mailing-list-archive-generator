CNN is presenting coverage of China's decision to pull the plug on more
than 100 sites, and issuing a list of sites which are illegal to connect
to.

(Net censorship is getting to be a big story....when the list of countries
reaches 15, it will of course no longer be news. And when the United States
block access, this will all be transmogrified into an "Anti-Terrorist
Action.")
