I wonder how they are doing this?  We know that the Germans allow full
internet access (don't they?), so they can't be using a filtering http
proxy.  I guess they're blocking on IP number (and perhaps port).  It
might be a good idea for xs4all to gather up all of their spare IP
numbers, and alias the lot on their web site - this would increase the
number of blocked addresses needed.  It might also be a good idea to run
some proxies on unusual ports (eg. smtp, DNS, pop, ftp ports) (although
of course this will then need to be a dedicated proxy machine) - again
this would increase the size of the blacklist that the Germans must use,
and may involve some awkward router programming (for example, a router
might be configured to allow all DNS traffic - if a proxy is sitting on
the DNS port, then things get a bit difficult to set up).  Of course,
netscape probably won't allow use of these ports (it certainly doesn't
allow the use of port 79).
