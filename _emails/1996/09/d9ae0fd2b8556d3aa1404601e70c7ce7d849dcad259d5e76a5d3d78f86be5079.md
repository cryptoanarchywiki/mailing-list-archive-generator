There is no such thing as an "ordinary citizen". When the U.S. commits
war crimes in Korea, Viet Nam, Grenada, Panama, Somalia, Iraq, and elsewhere,
every American taxpayer is an accomplice and a fair game. Likewise, any
Britih subject is fair game for IRA's self-defense against centuries of
British genocide and oppression.

Murder can be justified.

I think public executions of politicians would be a more effective way
to indimidate the potential successors than covert assassinations.
Joe Stalin liked public hangings toward the end of his life. I'd rather
see the bastards hang in a nationally televised ceremony, live from the
Rose Garden, but I guess -- whatever gets the job done.

It's a pity the IRA didn't nail your cousin. I wish them better luck next time.
