It is Imperrative that you do the following to ubsubscibe umself 
luddite.

Get 3 other friends to send in messages to majordomo@toad.com with 
the line 

subscribe cypherpunks (their email address here)

in the message

then once they have subscribed send a message to cypherpunks@eff.org 
with the following in it:

Authorise:
(email 1)
(email 2)
(email 3)

END

replacing (email x) with their email addresses.

then send a message to majordomo@toad.com with the line:

unsubscribe cypherpunks (your email)

and you will be taken off
the 3 friends email addresses act as a security protocol to ensure 
you cannot be maliciously removed by someone else..

they will then have to repeat the exercise with 3 friends each of 
their own to unsubscribe themselves and so on down the chain...

good luck.
