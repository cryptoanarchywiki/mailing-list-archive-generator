Germany went after the most visible site, the _original_ site. That other
sites were mirroring the verboten material did not stop them from blocking
access to xs4all, so Germany clearly still wanted to make an example of
xs4all.

That xs4all eventually capitulated has to be seen as a win for Germany.

(Certainly within the government of Germany, they must be viewing this as a
victory.)

They will probably now turn their sights on other sites (no pun intended),
hoping to pick off each one in turn.

I guess it's the domino theory all over again.
