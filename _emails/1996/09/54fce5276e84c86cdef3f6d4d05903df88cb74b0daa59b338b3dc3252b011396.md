One ISP uses a filtering proxy which still can access xs4all,
while blocking the HTTP port to www.xs4all.nl for their users.
Others simply block the IP number.

Of course, everyone still can use the mirror sites, the anonymizer,
open proxies, free Lynx accounts and www-by-mail services. The
prosecutors don't seem to understand that yet.

They are already rotating IP numbers. :)
