	The actions they claim they will do will, of course, lead to no
results whatsoever in many cases... as it should be. The hotline in question
sounds like a number as opposed to an email address... pity, we could just
bounce all spam to it and ask them to deal with it.

	Being financed by the industry = if you're going through a British
ISP, you're paying for it whether you like it or not.

>   Internet users can contact the hotline to complain about material

>   facsimile.
   
>   Safety-Net operators will try to see where the material came from,

	As this is an international network, this is completely impossible.

	Usual government doubletalk.... preserving free speech means no
such actions.
