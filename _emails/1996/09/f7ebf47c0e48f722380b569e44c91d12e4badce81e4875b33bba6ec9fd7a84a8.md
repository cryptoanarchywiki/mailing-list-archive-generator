! Hey, Hans, ya gotta watch those "Cc: cypherpunks@toad.com" lines!

Like I explained before, this was a problem with a user of one of my/our
systems, and has been taken care of.

! At least now we know who the _other_ "Unicorn" is.

Well that has never been a secret...  Has it?

! How's Sequent doing? Is Casey Powell still there?

Sequent is  doing extremely  well.  New architecture  well on  it's way,
looking good!   And yes,  Casey is  still in  charge.  Wanna  know more?
Then let's continue this off line...
