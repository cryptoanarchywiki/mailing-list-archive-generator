I could have said this -- 

A few months ago, on the subway (the 4 train, if anyone gives a flying 
fig)  in Manhattan, I noticed the whole train was literally PLASTERED 
with copy after copy of the same sign -- a picture with a bullseye on a 
guys head who was speaking over a "stolen" cell phone.  Apparently they 
like to think they can say that all of the cell companies banded together 
to fight fraud. And I quote "It is now possible to track fraudulent calls...
so we can serve you better...mutual cooperation of ..."  and so on.

Cute.

There is no freedom left. You mark my words.  Look how much has been lost 
in the last year alone.

MILLIE'S PROJECTION:  By this time next year we will be in a totally 
FUTURE SHOCK "dystopia".   We're almost there.  Sign, in the subway, for 
the EMX card (a nice little credit card thing with your medical history 
on a chip) -- YOu just got in an accident. Quick, now answer 17 important 
questions about your health.

Geez, I'd rather mandate MedAlert bracelets.


This must end.

PS: for the record, I do not advocate diddly squat, am not a terrorist, 
and want the old things back.
