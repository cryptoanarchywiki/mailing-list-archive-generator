You can find a map of the Stanford campus on the web at
http://www.stanford.edu/home/visitors/campus-map.html
To confuse Stanford alumni, the map has been realigned with the
North end up, so visitors can use it.  From Campus Drive East,
turn North on Mayfield Ave, turn right on Lagunita Dr, and park in the lot.
Walk north to Tressider, and the tables are on the west=left side.
Look for the crowd of drug smugglers, money launderers, and Suspicious Persons.

#			Thanks;  Bill
