Due to the overwhelming number of requests for the new RSA chip 
data sheets, I am moving from a fax to a web distribution.

A fellow CP is currently scanning in the 28 page specs. We will post the URL 
tomorrow.

If the chip and the RSA/DES ISA board (using the chip) currently in my 
possession work as well as I hope they do, either the company I work for 
or I will most likely distribute them.

I have not yet received a request for the one loaner chip. Are there no 
hardware-hacking CPs in the SF Bay Area? That seems hard to believe.
