    Dale I wouldn't worry about the mountain and what is under it. It is
only genealogical stuff. Salt lake has to wait 100 years or 99 (i Forget)
in order to be able to make the records public. The SSA makes death info
available as soon as the body is cold. And that is on cd rom. Most banks
have contingency plans for having intact records in case of nuclear or
civil disturbance. Again it is under the mountains . 
   As for costs ,the full amount of the custodial costs are born by
members. Originally it was by donations of money and I think now it is
taken from the tithe. That is a sum in excess of 1 billion dollars by the
members.
