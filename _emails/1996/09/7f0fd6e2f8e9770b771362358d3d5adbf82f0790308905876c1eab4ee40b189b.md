It's Phone Company Dependent.  Here in Pac Bell territory,
an ISDN phone line costs about 2.5 analog phone lines,
and gets you two phone lines plus some signalling.
Connection costs are free at night, and 1 cent/minute daytime.
That may change - the phone company is appalled that all these
computer people interpret the phrase "free at night" as meaning
"it's _free_ at night", so their holding time predictions were bogus :-)
Night is defined as 7pm-7am for ISDN.  ISDN-equipped ISPs start at
about $30/month; don't know if that's unlimited connect time or not.
