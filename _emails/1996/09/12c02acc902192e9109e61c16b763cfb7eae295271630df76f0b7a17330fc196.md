	As I recall, the alleged "subsidy" consists of lack of payments so
rural areas can have subsidized phone service - thus making their costs borne
by everyone else.

>   FCC staff attorney Kevin Werbach said the subsidy began in 1983, when
>   the five-member federal commission created a special rate to encourage
>   the growth of on-line services, voicemail companies and other emerging
>   industries that offered enhanced electronic services over phone lines.
   
>   In 1987, the FCC considered ending the subsidy but backed down after
>   public protest over what came to be characterized as the "modem tax."
>   Given the growth in on-line usage, ISPs assume any talk of ending the
>   subsidy would create a bigger backlash today.

>   Schrader said when he visited several FCC members recently, he
>   suggested that many of those users would be happy to send a letter of
>   protest to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.
