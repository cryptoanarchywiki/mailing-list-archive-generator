In the talk about replyable nym-mailers I haven't
yet seen netescrow mentioned.

You DID all read this ?

This all hinges on a policy to be followed by archive holders defining
the conditions under which they release their shares.  
This could be receipt of a signed request from the owner (remailer).

Maybe the table relating nyms to reply addresses could be stored in
netescrow style so that captured remailers reveal nothing.  The problem
of operator coercion is not addressed by this.

Police investigations might apply "angry mob cryptanalysis" to find
a sender - convincing a sizable number of operators that a crime had
been committed with some particular piece of traffic.

Anybody want to estimate traffic + storage requirements ?  Or number
of participants needed for a viable scheme ?
