I'm afraid my source is "Read it on the net and was surprised to hear it".
My assumption is that the limit is for software that implements
both signature and verification, since ITAR doesn't ban export of
pure-authentication software.

Is the State Dept doc on the net?  It would be nice to have something
saying there are well-defined rules that they agree to follow,
unreasonable and unconstitutional though they may be.
