Abstract:

>From World War I on, interception of communications took its place beside
traditional human intelligence as a vital implement of state power.  Over
the past two decades, a combination of falling costs and new technologies
have made high-grade cryptography widely available. This threatens many
communications intelligence sources --- though probably not communications
intelligence itself. The result has been a series of panicky government
attempts to control the spread of cryptographic technology.  As long as
individuals have access to computers that really `work for them,' such
attempts are unlikely to succeed.  The opponents of cryptography may,
nonetheless, damage both our democracy and our economy with their efforts.
