They're recycling an old USA Today piece. 

Turns out that figure was extrapolated by an internal investigation team 
trying to break into unclassified/non-secure systems. They just took the 
success rate for thier attacks and multiplied it by an arbitrary number 
to come up with an "annual" rate, according to the USA Today article.
