Thanks for the history correction; I got involved with Cypherpunks about
a year after the initial meeting/game, so I'm going on other people's
comments about the intent of mixes and remailers.  Out of curiousity,
did either spam or blackmail show up during the first run of the game?

Keeping the sender's identity hidden from the recipient is a different
problem than keeping either of them hidden from Untrusted Third Parties.
Conventional crypto is fine for keeping message content secure from
eavedroppers, but isn't enough to prevent traffic analysis;
that requires either mixes or at least message pools or broadcasts.

I've also been pleased by how long Julf's remailer stayed in business.
