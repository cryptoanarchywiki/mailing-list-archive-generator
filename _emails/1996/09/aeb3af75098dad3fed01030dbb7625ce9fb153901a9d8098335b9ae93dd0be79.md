Jon Leonard made it clear to me that he was planning a human-assisted 
game/MUD, rather than a computer simulation.  His explanation is that it is 
difficult to implement an unbiased simulation, because it is difficult to 
"simulate" a human.  But putting people controlling characters into the 
equation restores the "human element" which arguably will make the results 
more realistic.  Makes sense to me.

The one item I suggested was that instead of people controlling individual 
characters in this MUD, they control a "weighted character" whose weight 
depends on the number of people of that type in the society.  After all, in 
the path towards a crypto anarchy-type situation, people will naturally have 
to migrade away from government-oriented solutions, and towards other jobs.  
Some will be killed, some will retire, some will switch jobs, etc.  Turning 
such a group into a weighted character would allow their number to reflect 
societal changes a more quantitatively than individual characters.
