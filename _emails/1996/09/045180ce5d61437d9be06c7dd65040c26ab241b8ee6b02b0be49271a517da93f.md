If the DSD is anything like our GCSB then what they'll have told you is what 
they'd like to be the case, not what's really the case.  They will tell you 
what it pleases them to tell you, which doesn't necessarily have anything to 
do with the facts.  The easiest way to check the real situation is to look at 
your customs act, the NZ Customs Act of 1995 (which in the relevant area is 
almost identical to the 1966 one) covers forms of export in excruciating 
detail.  Doesn't mention anything about computer networks in there.  In 
practice it'd have to be decided in the courts, but I don't think the DSD will 
take action because there's a very good chance they'd get a ruling against 
them, which is also why the NSA is so reluctant to enforce the ITAR in court.
