! I ain't no fucking Libertarian. All Libertarians are fucking statists.

They are.  That's why I said the above.  I just think voting
Libertarian or American Independant would be easy choices, for
*single issue* purposes only, their entire packages seperate
or together, suck.

! P.S. you also wrote:
! 
! ]Andie, that forgery was either Dr. Fuckhead, or someone trying to pin
! ]the blame on the good doctor.  I'm glad {s}he posted it, it was funny
! ]and it also gave a hint who did the forgery of Ingrid.  Either
! ]someone out to get him, or the doctor himself, if so, he lives in
! ]New York City too!  Maybe you can meet your secret admirer!
! 
! While Rich Graves is a proven liar and forger, the article you refer
! to is a perfectly good and authentic article from Rabbi Shlomo R.

Sure!  Why don't you just respond to the e-mail I sent you 
directly, Dr. D Graves!  I, myself, study with the *real* Rabbi
Schlomo.

! I don't know who forged Ingrid - probably Rich Graves, a proven forger,
! liar, and a fucking Libertarian statist.
! 
! ]Now if it's someone out to get the doctor, I'd pin the blame on
! ]Rich Graves, because of his obssessive hatred of Ingrid, in which
! ]he did the post so it could be blamed on Dr. Fuckhead, who
! ]perhaps would hate Ingrid too, because she has written many times
! ]about how her family was hurt by Russians and Jews.  Dr. Fuckhead
! ]may be Jewish, you know, since 80% of immigrants from Russia this
! ]generation have been Jewish, because Jews have first priorty in
! ]USA immigration law.
! 
! Yes, I'm Jewish.

Aren't we all, really, deep down, I mean, when we real little,
I mean, in mind, yesterday, year, in the past.
