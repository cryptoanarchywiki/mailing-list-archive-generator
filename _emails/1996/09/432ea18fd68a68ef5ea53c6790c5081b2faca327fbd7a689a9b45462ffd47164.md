If the phoneco was realistic about ISDN value, they'd decide that since 
anybody can buy a 31k modem  for $100 or so, the "value" of a 128K 
connection is about $400, and then they'd charge based on the actuarial 
value of this hypothetical one-time fee, at perhaps an interest rate of 5% 
or so:  In other words, about a $20 per year charge, or around $2 per month.
