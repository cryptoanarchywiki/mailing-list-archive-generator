If you had enough RAM in the machine, you could disable swapping, send all log
files to /dev/nul (or /dev/lp0), run *only* a web server or anything else that
can avoid writing to disk (probably no CGI, etc).  It wouldn't be too
interesting, but then you probably don't want much happening on your web server
anyway. You could even wire that write-disable switch or jumper into a
keyswitch on the main console.
