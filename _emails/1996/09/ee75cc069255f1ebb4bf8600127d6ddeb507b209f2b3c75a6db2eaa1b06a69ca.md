   If memory serves, the disinfo campaign following the Airbus incident
put much emphasis on the plane's (allegedly) erratic, seemingly hostile
behavior: it was said to be menacing a specific US ship in the convoy. It
later turned out, I think, that the ship being menaced was a radar ghost
fabricated by the Vincennes's AEGIS system.
