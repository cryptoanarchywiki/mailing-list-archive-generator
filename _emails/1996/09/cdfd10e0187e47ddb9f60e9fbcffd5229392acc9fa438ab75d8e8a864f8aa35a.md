You need to take into account the politics of the region. With Saddam gone you have
created a power vaccume that Iran would be all to happy to fill. It was for this
reason that durring the Gulf War the US & its allias (European & Arab) did not go to
Bagdad. They mearly wanted to knock Saddam down a notch or two not take him out.

I will agree with you about the taboo on political assassinations. Even the Mossad
are not involved in assassination of government leaders (they keep such actions to
rather nasty terrorist). The assassinations of government leaders that have taken
place in the region have all been from citizens of their own country.
