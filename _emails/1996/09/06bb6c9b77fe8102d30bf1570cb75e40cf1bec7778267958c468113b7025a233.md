>Edupage, 15 September 1996.  Edupage, a summary of news about information

>seeking to transform education through the use of information technology.

>SATELLITE BROADCASTERS MUST PROVIDE EDUCATION, TOO
>A federal appeals court in Washington has ruled that any company providing
>direct broadcast satellite (DBS) services must "reserve a portion of its
>channel capacity, equal to not less than 4 percent nor more than 7 percent,
>exclusively for noncommercial programming of an educational or information
>nature," in compliance with regulations drafted by the FCC to enforce laws
>enacted in 1984 and 1992.  The unanimous decision rejected arguments by Time
>Warner and other broadcasters that the law interfered with their First
>Amendment rights.  "It is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the
>right of the broadcasters, which is paramount," said the court, quoting a
>1969 Supreme Court ruling.  (Chronicle of Higher Education 13 Sep 96 A29)

	Bloody socialist Supreme Court... sell the _full_ rights, then use
the money to reduce taxes.

>SYSTEM CRACKER GOT RECIPE FROM HACKER MAGAZINE
>The person who disabled New York's Panix Internet service probably followed
>the line-by-line instructions for doing so that appeared in the latest issue
>of 2600 magazine, the Hacker's Quarterly.  "We need to educate the community
>that it's very, very simple to cause massive mayhem," says 2600's editor,
>who defended his editorial judgment.  "A lot of companies subscribe to us so
>they can learn before they're victimized."  Panix's co-owner says he
>supports 2600's right to publish such information:  "As a matter of
>principle I don't think they should have been stopped," but adds that unlike
>most other recipes for breaching security published in the magazine, this
>one has no known technical defense.  (Wall Street Journal 13 Sep 96 B5)

	Helpful to quote Panix on it.
