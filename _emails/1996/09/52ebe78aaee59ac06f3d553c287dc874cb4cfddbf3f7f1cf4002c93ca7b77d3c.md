Yes, that is why there needs to be a move to place all 'critical' portions
of remailers and other important servers inside trusted hardware which is
highly resistant to compromise.  All access to sensitive information (e.g.,
keys) inside these modules should require multiple parties in several
countries (not just the operator of the server) to cooperate.  Properly
structured (such controls could effectively thwart law enforcement
compromise.
