WIRED WORLD WILL "DIMINISH NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY"
A leading Clinton Administration official on information security and
cryptography matters says that traditional notions of sovereignty, national
security and warfare will be undermined by the year 2020, when the whole
world is "wired" and e-cash is the norm.  The result will be less powerful
governments in relation to criminal organizations such as the Mafia and
international drug cartels, says Michael Nelson, who adds that organized
crime members are already some of the most sophisticated users of computer
systems and strong encryption technology.  In addition, computer crackers
will pose a more significant threat.  In response, Nelson advocates
resolving the issue of whether unauthorized access of a computer is an "act
of trespass" or an "act of war," and prosecuting the intrusions accordingly.
