N.B. Your disagreement is with Peter's paper, not me unless I have
inadvertently misrepresented what he wrote.

I think Peter was looking for non-destructive methods which would allow
continued use of the hard disk

Peter thinks this strength is to strong for practical application.  He
describes someone who had a strong enough research magnet which bent the
platters.  Since erasing the clocking tracks requires them to be rewritten
at the factory, magnets do not allow reuse of hard disks.

Burn after shredding, or you have a puzzle fan reassembling the shredded disk.

Hastily, but with regards - Bill
