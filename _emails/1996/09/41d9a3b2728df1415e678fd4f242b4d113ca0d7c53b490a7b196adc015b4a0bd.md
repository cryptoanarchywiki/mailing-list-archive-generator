that is one of their way of seing life: as long as you have the 
physical means to perform an action and that nobody else can stop 
you, you can do it.

Again, he doesn't ask himself why the page, put into existence (most 
of the time by the good will of the creator and owner of the account, 
paying out of his own pocket from his own work) does not bear the 
mention: "we invite spam"

"Civilisation, is the transition from a public society to a society 
of privacy" (approximate quote from Ayn Rand).  We have laws that 
hope to accomplish that, i.e. trying to set men free from other mens. 
Passwording is like putting a lock on a door: to prevent intrusion 
from peoples that have different values.  Note that the trespassing 
is *always* done in favor of the looters at the expense of the 
producers.

I'm glad the tresspasser limits the field of his victims.

He does it very simply: by blanking out the nature of his acts.  
Only, there is no logic in this act, only feelings.

No, it is not self-centered at all, it is only done on the impulsion 
of the moment.  If he were smart, he would realize that reputation 
takes years to build and seconds to destroy.

If you don't want to get mugged, don't walk in the street; if you 
don't want to get killed by a mugger, chase him and offer him you 
wallet, then kill yourself.

I grew in an extended family where there was always money and
wallets on the kitchen table. But no matter how broke one of us were,
if it did not belong to him, he did not take it.  It is, of course,
out of respect for life (and it's economic extension, the right to
property)

Don't exists... ( because to him, the use of force is legitimate and 
there is no such right as the right to live, as long as he's got 
stronger arms than yours)

I won't start a discussion here.  I will simply state that words have 
a definite meaning and that by twisting them (I suppose innocently in 
your case), you give them a moral sanction.
