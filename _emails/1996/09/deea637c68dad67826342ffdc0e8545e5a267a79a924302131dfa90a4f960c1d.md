It's affecting the rights of these fine spammers, Cyber Promotions.  
That affects spammers everywhere.  More rules by our government 
affects all of us.

That's the real point I have always made.  No rules and we should
not want rules.  Why are we INVITING the government into OUR
internet??? Just cause we have to read spam?  That is just plain
stupid!!!  Just cause we have to read spam, oh well, let the
government come on in. Do we let the government into our bedrooms
because our wife says no to sex tonight or because we don't like to
make our beds??  Everyone on this list seems to want to limit
government  intervention EXCEPT when it comes to spam, then every
one just holds the door open wide and let them in.  If they get that
inch, they WILL take the whole 9 YARDS!!!!!!  Get a clue, delete or
killfile those who spam and keep the government out of
cyberspace!!!!!!


By the way, I get about 2 or 3 spams a day in my mailbox and it is 
not killing me!  Don't get the wrong idea, I don't like it.  I like 
the government WAY LESS!!!!!
