Yes.  What I had in mind resembled the split list scheme used at a church I
used to go to.  UK tax law has concessions for regular giving (Covenants, in the jargon)
and the church needed to know that comittments were being met.  At the same time it was
preferred not to know who was giving what.  This was done by having 2 lists eg

Namelist:  Mr J Smith  = member 999

Cashlist:  member 999 gives  1000 / month

If member 999 didn't give as planned, cashlist-holder could say to namelist-holder
"have a word with 999".

These were held by 2 people, trusted not to collude.  Also I suppose committee
reshuffles shouldn't put one person straight into the other post.

My idea was to replicate this split list so that

addrlist:  leukos.gleukos@c2.org  = index97b6150200000564
nymlist:   index97b6150200000564  = an0001002304000101@this.remailer

This would be altered for the remailer table as:

addlist: leukos.gleukos@c2.org            = index97b6150200000564
addlist: an0001002304000101@this.remailer = index97b6150200400281

and these 2 mappings would be escrowed:

index97b6150200000564 -> index97b6150200400281
index97b6150200400281 -> index97b6150200000564

(Or just escrow the _keys_ for the latter, as Matt first thought.)

The aim is to prevent a seized remailer having its data read.
The "angry mob cryptanalysis" is a side issue.

I did say this didn't address operator coercion.  The widespread
cross-jurisdiction aspects of netescrow will be important here.

Capture of hardware without scope for operator coercion would be
protected against - but is an easy problem anyway.

I was thinking of calling this the "shredder ticket" and giving it to
the sender (who can then distribute it to all remaining remailers without
needing to use the seized one).  This would depend on him realising that
the remailer was (about to be) seized, and would have to be done before
the enemy rounded up the shares.  [Incidentally I'm not that keen on
regarding the police as the enemy.  My mention of "angry mob cryptanalysis"
in the event of a crime was to show that it was not the ideal vehicle for
crime.  But then maybe I'm a statist pig.]


In any case it would be necessary to

(Perhaps including compulsory cross-border secret reassembly. )

I was envisaging this being combined with Mixmaster.  (I see from your
Eternity post that you'd run a netescrow scheme that way.)  This gives
us "vertical integration"  a sort of "of the remailers, by the remailers
and for the remailers".  Careful design of message formats could make it
hard to tell the escrow mechanics from the traffic.  To mount this collusion
attack the TLAs would have to be part of the scheme - helping to pass most 
anonymous messages in order to trace some random ones, not necessarily those
they want to trace. (If there was nothing in it for them they wouldn't join.)

(Compare that to the current state quoted as near as I can remember from AC2
  "It seems reasonable to assume that the NSA can break any message that it
   intercepts, but not all messages")

It takes time to collect the shares and determine the next destination,
during this time the message is sat in a pool. (Is there scope for traffic
analysis in the fact that the average speed of messages will be lower
than that of shares ?)

With that in mind I was looking at the scope for cheating.

Cheating seems possible by:

1)  Collusion (as mentioned)

2)  Not releasing (valid) shares when requested
    This can be caught by traps.  The list of where the
    shares went is usually destroyed, but need not be.
    The shareholders are none the wiser, and when they get
    known for not releasing shares the remailer excludes them
    from future share issues.

3)  Flooding attacks - storing rubbish in escrow servers who
    are eventually forced to accept no more shares, or ditch
    some existing ones.  So far as I can see Matt's Netescrow
    scheme has exactly this problem.  Ecash payments might help.
    If existing shares are ditched the reply-ability will not last
    long.  You might get a message you can reply to for 2 weeks, but 
    no later.  Sender might resend periodically - a bit like following
    up an unanswered snail mail.

As in the last sentence or so of the OKE paper.
