(Actually, it was a factor of 4000 since it was only 64 processors, but 
who's counting?)

Anyway, this reminds me:  What was Moore's law?  Performance doubling every 
18 months as I recall?  How does this stack up?  Well, 24 years is 16 times 
18 months, so the increase in performance should have been 2**16, or 64K.   
Off by a factor of 16, which is fairly close, as exponential expansions go.  
If I were inclined to make the numbers fit the theory, I would argue that 
the design for the Illiac IV was probably based on SSI IC technology that 
was defined in 1966 or so, which would provide the extra 6 years (four 
doubling periods) which account for the "error."  One of the advantages of 
modern CAD technology is that chips can go from foundry to a working 
computer far faster.


A few months ago, there was an item about how IBM had demonstrated its 
ability to produce 0.08 um silicon chips, with a gate delay (don't recall 
how loaded this was...) of about 24 picoseconds.  Such a process could 
probably be used to produce a single chip that can do about 1 giga 
operations per second, assuming it was pipelined adequately.  But even 
that's "only" a teraflop with 1000 such chips...It makes me wonder what kind 
of a rabbit they're gonna pull out of the hat to produce a petaflop.

I think it was turned off in about 1982 or 1983.  I did a web-search on its 
history a few months ago.

True, but the world would be FAR better off if the architecture for the 
commonly-used PC could be extended to allow multiple processors.  Yes, I'm 
aware of the inefficiency issues associated with multiple processors, but I 
think the dramatic cost reductions associated with the use of larger numbers 
of cheaper CPU's would much more than compensate for them.

As I see it, there are inefficiencies associated with both making a single 
CPU do multiple tasks, as well as making multiple CPU's do a single task.  
The former is one of the reasons that PC's have pretty much mopped the floor 
with mainframes, because the PC's were not "unfairly" hobbled with having to 
implement complicated time-sharing software.  The latter is the classic 
problem which kept prople from going to massively parallel machines from 
scalars.  However, I don't think that most of the problems a typical PC 
accomplishes are those "hard to divide" problems that resist parallel 
implementation.  Rather, a multiprocessor PC would assign larger tasks 
(programs) to individual CPU's and not try to break up a program.
