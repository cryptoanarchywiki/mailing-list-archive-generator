I suggest doing as I do, that is giving the number to no one at all but
forwarding a public number to the cell phone when you need to.  "Unlimited
forward" allows you to call your own number from anywhere and change
forwarding details.  Quite useful.

Many digital phone have caller ID which you could use to screen for
"urgent" calls when the time is pricy.

You might also consider giving folks a beeper number for "urgent calls"
and you could then call your voice mail from your cellphone to see if you
wish to bother calling back.

This has the added advantage of preventing the tracking of your movement
by determining which "cell" your phone happens to be on at the moment
(phones talk to cells when on but not talking).
