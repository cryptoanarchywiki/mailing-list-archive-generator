A _very_ minor correction. My copy of "The White Plague" is not handy, but
I distinctly recall reading it circa 1980-1, certainly no earlier than
1977-8.

The ARPANet was going strong by then.

Newsgroups were getting started around 1980, give or take, as I recall.

But of course I agree that "The White Plague" was written long before "The
Net" became a household name. (Interestingly, Herbert was
computer-literate, and he even wrote a book about using PCs, circa the late
70s....something like "Nailing Jelly to a Tree.")
