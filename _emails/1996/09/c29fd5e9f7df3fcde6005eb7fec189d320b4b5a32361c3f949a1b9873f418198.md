Quantum computers *do* have a reverse.

Indeed even when operated in classical mode they *still* have 
a reverse.

A quantum computer is a reversible computer operated at very
high speed and very low energy.

Reversible computers were invented before quantum computers.

Reversible computer were invented in order to demonstrate that
there was no lower limit to the energy required to perform
certain computational tasks.

Later people speculated, and very recently demonstrated that 
a reversible computer operated in the quantum regime could 
do things that no classical computer could do.
