"I can't quite figure it out" - says a lot right there.

Per that comment about rationality: That LEA's knew about the ring, or 
that they would participate in a scam of some kind?

Any statement that is consistent with developments in this case, and 
other similar cases, most likely.

You should know that "many on this list" bears no relation to the LEA's 
mentioned above.  People on this list have relatively small agendas, in 
money terms, whereas the LEA's are servicing people with Big Money.

Please list any "real democracies". Thanks a bunch.
