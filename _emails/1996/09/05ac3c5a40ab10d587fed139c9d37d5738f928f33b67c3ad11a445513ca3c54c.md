These continental europeans tend to type '.' instead of commas, and ','
instead of points when they write numbers.  (They also have funny ones
and sevens, but that's a another story.)

I thought the offer of 100,000 DM very respectable, and a tad unusual
for a [usually conservative] telecoms company.  It sure beats baseball
caps and T-shirts.

I 100% agree ...

... but the semi automatics they carry are not much different to ones US
cops have.

And *they'll* decide what sort of deal *they* want to offer.  They did
say the money could be donataed to any non-profit organisation, so this
covers a wide range of organisations (your school or university perhaps,
or computer society, or even the Church of Scientology, The Vatican,
Mitre Corp, NFL, etc. etc.).  I wonder if Radikal is a non-profit  :-)
