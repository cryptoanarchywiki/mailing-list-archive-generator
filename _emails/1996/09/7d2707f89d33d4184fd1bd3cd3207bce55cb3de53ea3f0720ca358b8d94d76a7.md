Totally bogus - _my_ birth certificate didn't have my fingerprints on it :-)
Now, it may help stop people from getting duplicate licenses,
assuming they use the same finger each time and don't have the
sense to put rubber cement or ridge filler or something on their
fingers first (and assuming, of course, that the system actually
_checks_ the fingerprint in real time, rather than just recording it.)

Wouldn't be surprising; you didn't think you lived in America, did you?
