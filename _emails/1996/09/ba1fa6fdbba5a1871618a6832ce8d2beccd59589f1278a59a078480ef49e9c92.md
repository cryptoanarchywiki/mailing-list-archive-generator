Leftists are despicable. They steal our money, they corrupt our politics,
they nationalized our industries, they subvert our ideals, and they
undermine our national will.

The Democratic People's German Reich is fully justified in cutting off
contacts with subversive radical publications in Jew-dominated nations like
Holland.

As Reichskommander Schmidt points out: "The citizen-units who access
foreign Web sites will be rounded up and disposed of like the vermin they
are. We cannot allow the Revisionists and Leftists to triumph. We will send
them to the showers."

Heil Freeh!
