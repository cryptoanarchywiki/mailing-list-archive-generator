The terms "responsibility" and "accountability" are misused, which is
unfortunate, since I think we'd all argue in favor of taking responsibility
for our speech/actions in a positive sense. The negative is in asking me to
sacrifice my freedom because some few behave irresponsibly. This is like
setting an illogical default, assuming that it's a preventive, but it
prevents nothing.

Getting beyond this discussion of EFF, has any global entity discussed
making remailers illegal?
