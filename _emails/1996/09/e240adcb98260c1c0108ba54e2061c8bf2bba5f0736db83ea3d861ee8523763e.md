While I agree with Duncan's sentiments (obviously) and even agree that
censorship is impossible to completely implement, I think Duncan is
oversimplifying and thus trivializing the dangers to Chinese, German,
Singaporan, etc., subjects.

Prison sentences in Germany for those who reveal forbidden information
about "the Holocaust," prison terms (or worse) for dissidents in Burma,
China, and, of course, various other nations and "democratic people's
republics."

Even here in the United States, connecting to an illegal site may mean
imprisonment. (The charge: trafficking in child pornography, for example.)

Rather than saying such laws are "meaningless," developing blinded,
steganographic, etc. proxies may be a more useful strategy.
