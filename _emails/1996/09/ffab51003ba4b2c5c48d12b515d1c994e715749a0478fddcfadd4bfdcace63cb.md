No,

I can`t let that pass, the say that cypherpunks try to avoid danger 
in real life and online is absolute rubbish.
The libertarian polotics embodied by the cypherpunk movement 
encourages a way of life which is indeed more dangerous than other 
type of society, annoyances are different, sure they try to avoid 
annoyances, but this does not stretch as far as encouraging 
censorship, its just that, from my point of view anyway, most 
cypherpunks idea of a utopian society does not include big commerce, 
which is associated with big government, indeed most of us find the 
one minded lust for money of the junk mailers to be distasteful in 
itself.

to say we attempt to create a "safe" society online and off is 
correct but only in a superficial sense, I believe the cypherpunks 
want a safe society as much as anyone else but believe that the best 
way to achieve it is through individual liberty, not through 
totalitarian statist government, furthermore cypherpunks and 
libertarians as a whole accept that a dangerous society is an 
inevitable consequence of a free society, but that this is a price 
worth paying.
