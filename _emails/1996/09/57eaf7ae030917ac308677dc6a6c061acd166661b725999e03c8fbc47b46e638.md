This of course matches my expectation. I still think if prosecution is so
unlikely, the law ought to actually come to terms with this and remove the
"official illegality" of such things.

_Almost_ more important to me than "libertarian" ideals are "consistency"
ideals: namely, that there oughtn't to be laws which are not enforced, or
which are too expensive to enforce, or which can be selectively enforced.
And since I know that the full suite of laws, all 25,000 or 45,000 of them
(on all 27 linear feet of bookshelf space) cannot possibly be consistently
enforced, I favor a "minimalist" or "fallback" position of having
relatively few laws, covering mostly "crimes" which are more easily
detected and prosecuted (with draconian punishments).

I was probably overstating things to say this was "the real reason." The
real reason (or the more important reason) is that resources are finite,
and, as Brian noted, no prosecutor is much interested in someone being in
Zaire's mercenary army. It doesn't register on the public's concern meter,
and it probably doesn't get one promotions in the prosecutorial community.

But the law should still be changed to reflect this reality.
