I don't think you truly understood the *mechanism* of AP.  Your
cousin was threatened from an outside attack.  Protection is
relatively easy in that case.  AP generates a threath * within *
every * part * of every structure (family, work, friends, etc).  

As an analogy, when specialized demolishing team blows a building
down, they don't use one big charge, they use hundreds of them to
severe every load bearing member of the structure.  AP would work the
same, turning every person a potential motiveless assassin. I say
"motiveless" because AP makes the motive not traceable to peoples or
assets.

Some AP assassins will get caught, but it is predictable that it will
only be a minority and that with time, the percentage of caught
assassins will get smaller as more professionnal assassin gets
seriously into the business.
