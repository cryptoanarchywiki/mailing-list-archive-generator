| And it seems to me that your usage of "reputation" has at different

	A while back (Sept 94) I sketched out a system for using a
numeric indicator (from -1 through 1) as an indicator of how
interested (likely to read) you were in someone else's postings.  I
suggested that simple multiplication could achieve useful results.  If
I respect Alice 50% of the time, and Alice respects Bob 50% of the
time, then a rough cut at my interest level in Bob would be 25%.  If
Alice disrespects Charles 90% of the time, that gives him a negative
45% in my book.

	By generating simple numbers like this, I can tune my
tolerance level based on time.  Its not perfect, but roughly works.

	Deranged Mutant pointed out that radically different opinions
by a few people might cause the system to start behaving chaoticly,
and Hal also had some interesting comments.  Check the archives.

| I don't think this is an example of any such thing. I would not respect

| suggested polarity-math is self-contradictory.
| 
| Rather, I think this is an example of how direct exposure supercedes
| reputation.

	Kooks do mess things up a bit; but most people aren't kooks.
My enemies enemy is my friend is oft true.

	In the system I outlined, direct exposure clearly does
supercede reputation, except in the (possibly rare) case where you
respect someone else more than you respect yourself.
