Obviously not only the arrested killer used the schoolgirls chained
in underground cells. They were for hire. High officials used his
'services', then ordered the police to cover it up. Why else would
some ten policemen be arrested? The EU bureaucrats are served by
hordes of prostitutes. Surely there are pedophiles among the hordes.
Probably some EU pedophiles have a connection to the gang. I don't
know this of course, but speculation is cheap.
