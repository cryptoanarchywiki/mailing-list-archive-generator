Not saying they aren't; however, I don't recall seeing CNN or any of the
networks saying if the Navy really was firing missiles or not.  Have they?
Never seen anyone ask questions about US firing missiles (have seen them
ask if it was a missile or a bomb). I don't get any US newspapers here in
Anguilla, so my impression of the US press is really just from TV. 

Is the press on top of this?
