Dead wrong:

The pols always say "We would like your help in writing legislation, but
if you want to contribute to the legislation you must accept reasonable
compromise".

But we do not want legislation, so we do not want to help write legislation.

We want to delay legislation for as long as possible, for the longer the
delay, the more the balance of power favors the net and disavors the pols.

Therefore the correct strategy is simply to attack any politician who shows
any interest in legislating on our issues.

We have no friends on Capitol hill, and if we did have friends, it would
still be necessary to denounce them as enemies.
