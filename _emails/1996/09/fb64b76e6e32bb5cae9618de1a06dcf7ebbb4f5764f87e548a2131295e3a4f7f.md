It seems to me that the logic of these answers would make the movie,
"Carried Away" illegal.  According to a Boston Globe review (reprinted in
the local rag), "... his character cheats on his longtime girlfriend with a
new student who's only 17, ..."  Depending on how this is depicted in the
movie (Rated R), it seems to me that this could go over Hatch's line. 
(BTW, the review rates the movie 3 stars out of a possible 4.)
