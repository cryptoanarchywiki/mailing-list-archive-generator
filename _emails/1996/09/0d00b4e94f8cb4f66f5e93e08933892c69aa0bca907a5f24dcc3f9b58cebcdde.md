If you mean something like a 132x60 character terminal, you can get a
utility from Sunsite called SVGATextMode which will do that for you on a
standard VGA monitor, provided you have a graphics card which supports such 
a mode. I have an STB Nitro 2MB ISA card, and am running a 132x60 mode on a
14 inch monitor.

I think you mean /usr/spool/mail/postmaster, but I could be wrong. ;)
