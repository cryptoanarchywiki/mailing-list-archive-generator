DIMACS Workshop on Trust Management in Networks

September 30 - October 2, 1996

DIMACS, Rutgers University

     Joan Feigenbaum jf@research.att.com
     David Maher dpm@allegra.att.com

Theme:

The use of public-key cryptography on a mass-market scale requires
sophisticated mechanisms for managing trust. For example, any application
that receives a signed request for action is forced to answer the central
question ``Is the key used to sign this request authorized to take this
action?'' In certain applications, this question reduces to ``Does this key
belong to this person?'' In others, the authorization question is
considerably more complicated, and resolving it requires techniques for
formulating security policies and security credentials, determining whether
particular sets of credentials satisfy the relevant policies, and deferring
trust to third parties. This workshop covers all aspects of the trust
management problem. Relevant topics include but are not limited to:

   * General approaches to trust management
   * Languages, systems, and tools
   * Certificates and public-key infrastructure
   * Formal models and analysis
   * Trust management in specific application domains; including but not
     limited to:
        o Banking
        o E-mail
        o Internet commerce
        o Licensing
        o Medical information systems
        o Mobile programs and ``code signing''
        o Revocation of cryptographic keys
