I imagine that both modems in a connection become phase locked with the
underlying 8K digital carrier. Then each modem signal element is carried by
just one 8 bit digital sample. That carrier moves 8 bit bytes 8000 times
per second. Stopping at 56 Kb instead of 64Kb means that a 7 bit DA
converter for the sending modem and a 7 bit AD converter in the receiver,
plus some fancy analog filters to undo the subscriber loop effects. Going
for 64Kb would require twice the signal to noise ratio on the local loops.

I think that modern PBXs have a digital link to the phone company. This
would mean that an ISP would not have to buy fancy modems. A modified PBX
could transmit and receive bits to a computer directly. It will impact the
phone compnany's ISDN service but I don't think that they can stop this.
