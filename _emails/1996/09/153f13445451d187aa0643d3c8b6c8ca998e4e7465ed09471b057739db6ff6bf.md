They get sent back.

Was in line @ USPS. Guy showed up with 40-odd Priority Mail
Packages that had come back. Clerk stamped each one & off they went.

1) It was obvious from conversation the customer was a local.

2) The hand cancel stamp is TRIVIAL to forge. After all, until now,
who has WANTED to falsely zero-out the value of her stamps?
