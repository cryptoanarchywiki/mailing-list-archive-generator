I don't have the time or interest to read and write about Bell's
evil kook daydreams or Baker's contorted statist 
rationalizations.


Feel free to write any misrepresentations about me (in general 
or in specific) that you like.  I'm sure in the long run it will
do more harm to you than to me.


For what it is worth, I long ago warned that cpunks needed to
distance themselves from Bell in the public's eye.  Nowadays 
I don't really care what the public thinks of cpunks.


Regards,

Bryce
