But generally, it has been found a much better solution to fight fire
with water, and this is why I am not convinced of the ideological 
effectiveness of AP, although I don't doubt it's operationnal 
effectiveness at all.

I will take that sentence only slightly out-of-(specific)-context and
make a still pertinent remark about it:
  	
	This is *exactly* what Jim Bell, because of his opinions,
	envision to do with the AP system.


I find that absolutely hilarious!
