Perhaps I'm missing something here. If a key recovery infrastructure is 
required, let it develop free of government coercion and intervention. 
Let the free market develop it. If the KRI is indeed free, the Feds won't 
have any problems with us escrowing keys in Switzerland or Belize, will they?

The White House is not backpedaling as much as trying other attacks. 
Like having Clinton call wavering Democratic senators on Senate Commerce 
and reminding them of their political obligations to him in an election year.
And like the government-mandated key recovery infrastructure.

The fight is anything but over.
