Maybe so.  However I suggested that they would more likley outlaw non
GAK crypto, anonymous ecash, remailers, PGP, etc.

Perhaps I should read your later AP essay in case you have already
countered my practicality objections. (Do you have AP on the www
somewhere?),

We've seen people suggest that you couldn't get away with AP, by
claiming that the gambling was legal.  (They'd get you for interstate
gambling, conspiracy probably other things).

So, it seems to me that your only approach is to do the whole thing
anonymously.  That requires anonymous ecash (payee and payor
anonymous).  This means that the anonymous ecash bank will be shutdown
by the government as soon as it becomes apparent what is going on.

Remailer operators are similar soft targets.

The best you could do I think is this.  Publish a PGP public key, and
software or specifications for a robust steganographic encoding for AP
bets.

That would take care of comunication.

You still have the ecash problem.  What do you suggest?

Adam
