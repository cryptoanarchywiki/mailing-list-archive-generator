Moreover, this "spreading the responsibility" philosophy ties in with the 
recent practices (both in the civil and criminal areas) of passing blame 
around.  In civil areas, it's called "deep pockets."  In the criminal area, 
you occasionally see news items about laws making parents criminally liable 
for the actions of their children.

Why WOULDN'T the police want to shut down anonymous remailers?  The Leahy 
bill clearly didn't distinguish between remailer operators and users, so it 
is no leap to conclude that they would be treated similarly.
