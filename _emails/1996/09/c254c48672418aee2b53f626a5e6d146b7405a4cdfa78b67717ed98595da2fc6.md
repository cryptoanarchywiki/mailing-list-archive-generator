At today's SAFE crypto hearing in the House, Congressperns quizzed 
Gorelick about what the fuck the administration is trying to do by having 
their lackies attach amendments to the omnibus export act that would 
prevent judicial review of Commerce Dept export control decisions. It's 
already cleared the House.
