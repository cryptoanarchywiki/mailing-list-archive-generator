This week's c|net digital dispatch had the following top ten list.  For
number 8, did they mean DES or is the EDS something I'm not aware of.  I
figure it has to be because what does DES have to do with chat rooms?

>10. Kemp would fight with Dole over who gets to

>6. Hillary doesn't let the President in ANY chat rooms.
>5. Debate commission insists: event must be on Prodigy.
