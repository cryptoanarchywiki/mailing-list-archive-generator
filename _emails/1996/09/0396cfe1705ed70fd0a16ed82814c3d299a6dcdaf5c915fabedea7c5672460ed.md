I do not currently have an active practice in the United States.

Should a project come along within those boarders which interests

me, that might change.  I do not foresee that happening however.

        I presumed that  --it's a plus!  I never did, and never will.

        the research and the smell of blood (if channeled to real
    justice) is immensely satisfying --it is the members of the
    American club, and the intendent body trading which turns my
    stomach --that, and 'kill' based compensation.

        the difference in civil v. common law origined justice is not
    the code...

        to put it another way: in criminal procedings: I would rather
    be considered guilty, until proven innocent; than I would be
    presumed innocent, until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

        a nation whch can base a conviction on conspiracy to commit a
    crime, or permits circumstantial evidence to close the gap towards
    'beyond a reasonable doubt,'  has lost any pretense of understand-
    ing the heritage of common law: the Magna Carta.

  Of course the US Constitution isn't perfect;
    but it's a whole lot better than what we have now.
