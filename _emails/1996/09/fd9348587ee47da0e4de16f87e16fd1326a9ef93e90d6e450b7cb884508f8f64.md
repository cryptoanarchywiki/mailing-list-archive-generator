One could argue that the hundred years war was in substantial part
the result of regulatory arbitrage against attempts to censor the 
printing press, that it was in large part an unsuccessful attempt 
to create a uniform standard of censorship by force of arms.


History suggests that there *wont* be a uniform approach on policing
the net.
