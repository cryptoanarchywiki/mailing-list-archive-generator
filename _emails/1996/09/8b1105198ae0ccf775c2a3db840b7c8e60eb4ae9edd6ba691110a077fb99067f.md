Has anyone who's registered for next week's conference at Rutgers
gotten any sort of confirmation?  I've been trying for days to do
so, and though I've sent mail and called I haven't managed to get
hold of anyone who can tell me anything.  (And now they seem to not
answer the phone at all; I think they got a bigger response than
they expected.)
