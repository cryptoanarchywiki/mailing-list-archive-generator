Any secure hash can be used as a stream cypher.  Concatenate your key and a
block serial number (never to be reused) to get a number to exclusive or
with the plain text.  When you need a new block, use the next sequential
serial number.  (See Applied Cryptography)

Raw SHA probably isn't exportable because people can use it for crypto.  If
your use of SHA was bundled into a OS password scheme, you could probably
get a CJ on it and export it.
