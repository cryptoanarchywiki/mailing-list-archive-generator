This is quite real, and was posted on the CCC list a while ago.  It turns
out the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences (Cambridge, UK)
has been having a regular series of seminars on crypto and papers from a
distinguished group of presenters.  Several of the agenda notices, etc.,
have been posted here from time to time, hidden in the usual spew.

Look for the proceedings to be published by Springer Verlag.

Do a web search on 'Information Hiding' or 'Turbo Codes' or just go look 
at:  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/ihws.html

Snake oil, indeed.
