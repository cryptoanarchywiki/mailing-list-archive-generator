Audit trails may now be in place, in which case the cost of anonymity is
increased to the cost of the lowest denomination card. Think OTP.

However, in both Britian and France I have seen defective phones that allowed LD
calls but did not deduct the call amount from the card. Obviously, the effect
was free LD and these phones were perpetually busy.

If audit trails were in place, this problem should have been noticed quickly.

As I said, things may have changed for newer systems.

And phone companys that offers phone cards keep track of every call that 
goes thru each card number.
