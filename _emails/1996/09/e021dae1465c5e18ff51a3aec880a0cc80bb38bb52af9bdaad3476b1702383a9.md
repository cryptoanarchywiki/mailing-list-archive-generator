     This would be cutting their own throats. There is SO much commercial
and government traffic going across "The Net" that many businesses would 
scream bloody murder, and the government would have MASSIVE trouble with 
it's agenda.

     They are TALKING green, but their actions aren't. This shows that
the "libertarianization" of the ruling party would be in talk only.
Unfortunately people vote THEIR pockets, regardless of why their pockets are
the way they are. They vote their fears as well. They will almost always
vote for politicos who claim "anti-crime" (more like "more-prisons") and
"anti-drug" (read "more inner city youth inprisoned"), and soon 
"anti-crypto" (which will be based on 4-horsemen hysteria). People,
being for the most part stupid and short sighted, will vote away thier 
rights, just as they have done for the last 200 years. 

     No, I am not the LEAST BIT fatalist about this. I am trying to 
fight it with the limited resources I have, but...
