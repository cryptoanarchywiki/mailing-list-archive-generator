Yeah,

I too have noticed this.

Hey kids, heres uncle Pauls Snake oil test. if the post contains any 
of the following it is slither-squeek material:

1. The word "Proprietary"
2. References to a new algorithm, which hasn`t been seen yet and is 
"the strongest ever"
3. people who use TM after their alogorithm, this is Snakeoil(TM)(R)
4. People who think cryptographers seeing their algorithm will make 
it less secure
5. People who have never coded a crypto tool in their life then 
instead of working on current algorithm implementations re-invent the 
wheel because they don`t understand how to implement current ciphers.
