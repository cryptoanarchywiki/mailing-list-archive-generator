This week's c|net digital dispatch had the following top ten list.  For
number 8, did they mean DES or is the EDS something I'm not aware of.  I
figure it has to be because what does DES have to do with chat rooms?

>9. TOP TEN REASONS WHY THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES WON'T TAKE
>PLACE ON THE WEB
>
>10. Kemp would fight with Dole over who gets to
>    "quarterback" the keyboard.
>9. Oops: Gore plugged information superhighway cable
>   into White House central vacuum system.
>8. Perot's crack team of EDS hackers would get him
>   in somehow.
>7. Hotwired editors say presidential candidates not
>   hip enough.
>6. Hillary doesn't let the President in ANY chat rooms.
>5. Debate commission insists: event must be on Prodigy.
>4. Bill Gates owns the rights to online debates.
>3. Dole's Selectric won't connect to the Net.
>2. Chelsea is using the White House PC to write a
>   book report.
>1. In cyberspace, no one can feel your pain.
