Remember, though - TCPs initial estimate of the congestion window is 
never less than one packet, large numbers of opening connections can 
still (I think) lead to congestion collapse. It can defnitely get close 
to it.

At one point, when sunsite was getting a few 100k hits a day with only 
one T1 there were times when around 2/3rds of all packets were 
re-transmitted. Jon Crowcroft observed similar problems at some UK links, 
though see Van's article on either ietf or end2end a month or so  back
with the counter argument.
