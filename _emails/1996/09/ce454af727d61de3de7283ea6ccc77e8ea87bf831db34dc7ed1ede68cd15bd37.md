Thanks, Will, for the clarification. I agree that this will be a *very* 
interesting case and a lot of fun to watch. :)

I should clarify one thing I said earlier in which I mentioned the court's
"opinion." That seems to imply something lengthy. In fact, it was not. The
order was a one-page TRO.

Although AOL attorneys don't make the connection outright, their filings seem to imply that once one is an AOL customer, he's always subject to their rules. Wallace, it seems, had an account or two with AOL and was spamming during that time in violation of terms of service. They soon bumped him from the service.
