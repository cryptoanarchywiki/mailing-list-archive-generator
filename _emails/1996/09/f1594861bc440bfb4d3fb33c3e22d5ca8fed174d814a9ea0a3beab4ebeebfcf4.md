The required part will come later. Meanwhile, many big players in the 
industry are volunteering to include GAK for you.

When I asked the fellow from HP that proposed the CommerceNet position
paper how the "voluntary key recovery" he was proposing on his slides
could possibly aid law enforcement against criminals who obviously 
wouldn't "escrow" their keys, he said, and I am not kidding:

"There are many possible interpretations of the words voluntary and 
mandatory." I was the *only* person in a room full of people working in the 
industry that seemed bothered by this.

That's exactly how it will be.

Correct. As I explained in my post from the CommerceNet meeting in D.C., 
"key recovery" is the new politically correct term for GAK.
