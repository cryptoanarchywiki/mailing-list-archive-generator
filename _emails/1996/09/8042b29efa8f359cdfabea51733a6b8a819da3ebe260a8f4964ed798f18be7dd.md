This is one of the main problems with a system like this.  It would be very
hard to prove that a pseudonym isn't a fed.  Rather than restricting
communication to just a few people, everyone should be able to participate and
use a nym.  This would make arrests very difficult.  I think it is inevitable
that the communications would eventually be leaked to a TLA.  You might want
to look for information on PGPdomo.  This does just about everything you've
described.
