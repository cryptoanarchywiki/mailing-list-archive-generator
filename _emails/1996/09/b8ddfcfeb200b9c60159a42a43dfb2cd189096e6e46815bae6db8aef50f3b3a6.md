>But, "being able to afford the hardware is one thing," says a senior VP of

	I would suspect that one of the following will take place:
	A. Libraries will not wind up getting Internet access subsidized to
any great extent, since they can't afford to pay for the rest of it.
	B. Libraries will get Internet access subsidized, but won't be able
to use it a lot so the subsidy may eventually go by the wayside due to lack
of political support.
	C. Libraries will get everything subsidized.
