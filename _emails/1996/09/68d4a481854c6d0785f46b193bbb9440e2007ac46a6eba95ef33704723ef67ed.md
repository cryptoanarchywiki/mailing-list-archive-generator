I wish to gauge the response on something here:

Following the closure of the anon.penet.fi remailer:

If I can get enough funding to cover all expenses (I am a student and 
cannot unfortunately contribute much myself) I will install lines and 
hardware at my premises and run the equivalent to the anon.penet.fi 
remailer.

I don`t know what the response to this will be, I need approximately 
5000 UK pounds to set up such an operation (Yes, a leased line really 
does cost that much in the UK) and then a monthly income of around 
3000 UK pounds.

The service, I propose, would be free to the users, and maintained my 
by voluntary donation, no access restriction would be placed on 
non-paying users.

Please send me mail at paul@fatmans.demon.co.uk with the subject as 
ANON.PENET.FI SERVER and the message body an ammount in UK pounds or 
dollars (approximate ammounts are OK) so I can guage the response.
         NO MONEY WILL BE TAKEN AT THE PRESENT TIME.

As I said, I just want to see what teh response is like and to see if 
it would be possible, I also would be unable to set it up until I had 
some solid commintment from the people giving the money, I expect a 
large response to this and a measly one to the real appeal for hard 
cash if it goes ahead!  -  anyway, mail me and i`ll report the 
response back soon...
