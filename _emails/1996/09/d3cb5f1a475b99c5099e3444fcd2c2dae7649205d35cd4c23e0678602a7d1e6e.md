I subscribed just once, real name. Yep, the Welcome msg is ReallyTrulyFine[M].
 I reallytrulyread it.  High-traffic, though, is relative.  In light of
Z.B.'s post , I thought that maybe I , too, had a mail probem.  Seriously,
thanks for the info.

Usually, between 35 and 100 posts a day, most of which I delete.  Did 
you subscribe twice or three times under slightly different names  (but
identical e-mail adresses)?

RTFine Welcome Message, it explains everything you have to know

Hope you'll stay with us.
