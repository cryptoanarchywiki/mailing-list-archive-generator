	A better solution might be pay $whatever to be allowed to post
to the list.  Nothing is charged for receiving mail from the list, but you
have to ante up to join in the discussion.  If someone spams (spam being
defined up front and communicated to all list members) then their posting
priv's are revoked.  Then you can charge for receipt of mail normally
yet still have (relatively) open lists for discussion.
