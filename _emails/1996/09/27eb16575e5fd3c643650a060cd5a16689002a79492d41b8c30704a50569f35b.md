I recall that Tom Clancy, who has written a number of military fiction novels,
for which he has done endless notebooks full of research for, made a statement
about this.  He said, simply, that the TWA jet's explosion was at such an
altitude, that even if someone did it from a boat directly under, it was still
far too high for a Stinger missile to reach, much less dammage.  Just thought
I would throw that out there.

Tom Clancy is not a military-hired brain, but to make his novels realistic and
to do justice to the people he portrays, he does a LOT of research.  He is a
highly respected author, and I have no doubt that his statement is based on
his personal findings, collected for a previous novel.
