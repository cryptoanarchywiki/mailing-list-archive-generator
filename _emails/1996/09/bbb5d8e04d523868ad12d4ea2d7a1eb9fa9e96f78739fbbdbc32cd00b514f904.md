Perhaps the most ominous part of making "use of encryption to thwart an 
investigation" illegal is _not_ that remailer operators might be prosecuted, 
but that they might NOT be prosecuted in a deal where (in exchange for not 
being prosecuted) they continue to operate the remailer, "cracked" or 
sabotaged so that they share all the info with the cops.  While even that 
won't make chained remailers totally useless, eventually suspicions of such 
a crack will surface, which will help sabotage the credibility of all remailers, 
not just the ones that have been "stung."
