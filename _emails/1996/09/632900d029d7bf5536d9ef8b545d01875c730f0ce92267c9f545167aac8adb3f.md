And he, along with others, failed to solve the problems as well.  Is this progress?

For the record, if an AP-type system were to operate it would:

1.  Make it impossible for the British to continue to station troops in 
Northern Ireland, an eventuality that I suppose Phill resists.

However, it would also:

2.  Make it impossible and unnecessary for the British to have any troops 
anywhere, because it would eliminate  its government and military.  It would 
no longer be a country, merely an island with people living there.

3.  Make it unnecessary in Northern Ireland to protect the Catholics from 
the Protestants, or the Protestants from the Catholics,  because the 
trouble-makers from both (all?) sides would be quickly erased from the 
scene.  Nobody would rule anybody. Nobody COULD rule anybody.  All factions 
would either be peaceful or dead, their choice.  No political advantage could be 
gained by violence, because all politics would have ceased.

4.  Make it unnecessary and pointless for Northern Ireland to re-unify with 
Ireland, because likewise the government and military of Ireland would 
dissolve, as well as all political structure in that land as well.


In short, the only reasons that the current problems are maintained in 
Northern Ireland and Britain would be eliminated by the advent of AP.

So who is the "kook," really?
