Dear Sir,

I thank you for your e-mail. This has began 6 months ago, when a guy
has started to subscrive me on several lists and i got 300 mails/day.
this guy is sricca@worldcom.ch, he's only 15 years old and i've noticed
several complains here in Switzerland for him. I sent a mail to his admin
root@wolrdcom.ch, but i think they must be good friends, as i never 
received a reply from him. What i can do is to ask the mail-list admins 
to not let him subscribe me again. I don't understand, a mail-list as 
cypherpunhks where people talk about security, and if i want, i can 
subscrive in there all the e-mails i want :( couldn't you resolve this 
problem to be sure that i will no more talk about fucked mail-lists ?

It would be so great, so fantastic to forget cypherpunk mail list (and 
the others) as soon as possible. Please, do something.

Kind regards,

Joao Bento
