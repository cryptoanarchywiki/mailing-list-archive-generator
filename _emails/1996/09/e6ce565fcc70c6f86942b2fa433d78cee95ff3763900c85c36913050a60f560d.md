I have a similar plan.  My cell phone company includes call forwarding
in the package, so I deal with the possibility of junk calls by forwarding
calls from my cell phone to my regular number (which has voicemail)
during the day, then turning off the cell phone.  This way, the calls
are intercepted right at the switch (I assume), so no airtime is used,
and no charges are incurred.  Works for me...
