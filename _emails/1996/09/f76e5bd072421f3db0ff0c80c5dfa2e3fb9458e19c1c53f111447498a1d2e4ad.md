Mike Farrell, actor and longtime opponent of the death penalty:

        "We don't rape rapists,
          we don't burn arsonists,
            why should we kill killers?"

    well, come to thing of it, why don't we let a bull rape a rapist?

    or burn an arsonist at the stake?

    seems fair to me.  maybe even sell tickets to pay for the cost.

one of the few things we all share:
  the utter, corrosive contempt for our elected officials.

  Politicians are like diapers.
    They both need changing regularly, and for the same reason.
