Well, I suppose that if you don't believe in negative repuation capital,
I'm not going to be able to spend enough time to convince you. It's like
someone saying they're not sure such a thing as "entropy" exists.

No, with many of the list members, his reputation was in fact negative.
They disbelieved nearly anything he had to say, and his approval of some
idea was largely cause for others to take the opposite tack. About as clear
an example of a negative reputation as one can find. (Note that I am not
saying his reputation is negative with _me_.)
