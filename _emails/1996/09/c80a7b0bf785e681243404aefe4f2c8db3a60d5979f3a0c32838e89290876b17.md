It seems that if newsgroup RFC and the whole rigamarole of newsgroup voting
was set up, there would be enough people -- on this list alone, probably --
who would be interested enough in the idea to at least vote (publically)
for it. I certainly would, just to see what happens.

Of course, that means that someone *else* ;-) has to actually put the train
on the track, much less lay the rails, which, as usual, is the main problem
here. If we had some ham, we could have some ham and eggs, if we had some
eggs. If you  lived here, you'd be home now. And so forth.

Same as it ever was.

Cheers,
