I don't want the chip, but I'd like to know a few things.

1.  How much of a secure telephone does it contain?

a.  voice A/D/A?

b.  modem A/D/A DSP?

c.  Keyboard multiplex?

d.  control microprocessor?

e.  Encryption section?


2.  Is there any indication that NT+T has worked with any other 
manufacturers to design some sort of inter-telephone negotiation standard, 
one that would allow the kind of inter-compatibility that modems have today?
