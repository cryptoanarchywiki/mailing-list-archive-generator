   The message cannot be delivered because the
   recipient's mailbox contains the maximum number of 
   messages, as set by the system administrator.  The
   recipient must delete some messages before any
   other messages can be delivered.
    The maximum message limit for a user's mailbox is 
   10,000.  The default message limit is 1000 messages.  
   Administrators can set message limits using the 
   Mailbox  Settings function available in the 
   Manage User menu  (MUSER). 

   When a user's mailbox reaches the limit, the 
   user must delete some of the messages before 
   the mailbox can accept any more incoming messages.

It also provided anonymity to many people who needed it.  I think that many
people who need anonymity will probably just learn faking mail and news
headers.  Many people just don't want to deal with cpunk remailers.  OTOH, I
agree that this might actually force many people with Penet addresses to learn
about more secure remailers.  In this way, the closing of anon.penet.fi could
be looked upon as a Good Thing.  However, as long as there is no easy way for
Windoze and Mac users to use secure remailers, users will sooner resort to
fake-mailing then learning how to use cpunk remailers.  People that need a
pseudonym address to use on various support groups can get them from other,
equally insecure, remailers.
