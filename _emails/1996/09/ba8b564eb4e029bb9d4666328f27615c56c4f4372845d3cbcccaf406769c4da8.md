This sounds like exactly what I've been saying. You could paste the 
message inside or adjacent to the non-text data (and you could bit-pad 
the text before doing so), then move all the bits around, etc.

I'm not sure what was meant by "even ASCII characters could be 
hidden...", since just before you encrypt, everything's ASCII in some 
sense or another.
