Yah, but since 40-bit cyphers is seen by the "media" as something most
people don't use, but "smart cards" are just another type of
fraud-resistant credit card being used by Everyone Already, of course,
they have to start a stampede now.

I wonder if this isn't just plain Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt rearing
its ugly head... does Lucent (they were the ones, right?) have a competing
product?

Phil Fraering          The above is the opinion of neither my internet
