If anyone in the UK cares to get the GCHQ Venona releases, we'll be pleased
to  
scan them for distribution. Or put them on our Web site. 
 
 
Our fax:  212-799-4003 (US) 
 
 
Vox: 212-873-8700 
 
 
Or if someone else scans them and needs a Web site, ftp them to: 
 
 
     ftp://jya.com/pub/incoming 
 




{% endraw %}
