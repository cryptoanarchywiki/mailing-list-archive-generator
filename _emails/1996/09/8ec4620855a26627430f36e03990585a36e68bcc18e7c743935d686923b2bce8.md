It's still likely that if you left it running after a month or so it would be
next to impossible to do (assuming the NSA didn't get lucky - you still have to
worry!)

Such as asking why you didn't use some very strong crypto software?  Work out
some sort of parallel port dongle that could be connected, the software
generates a random key, the parallel port device is written and then removed.
Further access would involve connecting.  The code & chips needed have been
provided in many places; DDJ for one.  Allows a very convincing "Well it was
encrypted and your goon stepped on the key!"

This is too true.
