I always use my true name and am happy to spread it far and wide, but 
I have been doing some work for a GroupWare manufacturer.  They have 
seen that even in a corporate environment where information sharing is 
practised and embraced, sometimes people want to make a comment and 
not take the heat for making that comment.  This can provide some 
constructive input, so they have a anonymous comment feature built 
in.  So you could say that it is absolutely necessary for the web 
to have that feature as well.

NO WAY, These guys are in my life enough already, and you can't trust 
them anyway!!!!
