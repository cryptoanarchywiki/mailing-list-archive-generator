I dunno about that one.  Even if the message itself is encrypted,
every remailer has to have the address of the final recipient for
your plan to work.  And if you have cleartext for that message
(oops!) then any remailer operator could read it.  More traffic
is of course a good thing, but I'm just kinda iffy on the concept.
