Hi all

Some time ago I had various email exchanges regarding Australian crypto 
export regulations. More recently I've been put in the picture by David
Cox and others that there are in fact ITAR-like laws in force in Australia.
The last time I looked into this, Matt Crean(?) had very little luck finding
any info from the various relevant departments, have of whom didn't seem
to have a clue.

In short, Crypto export from Australia is illegal without a licence -
this is making it difficult for David's software firm to compete 
with their unhampered German competition.

Using the following search URL you can find the relevant text (shortened 
version appended))

However, if anything is done about ITAR in the US, I wouldn't be at all
surprised if Australia follows suit.

ps There is an awful lot of crap on c'punks these days - reading it is a bit
of a needle in a haystack exercise ;-(
