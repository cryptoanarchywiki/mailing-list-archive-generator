By the way, I used the name "Schmidt" in my satire post, sent out earlier
this morning. I picked that name randomly, being a common German name
(cognate to Smith, I believe), and meant nothing with regard to Stephan.

(I also don't dislike Germans in general. I studied some German in high
school--don't ask me to use it, though!--and have visited Germany. They
just have a certain well-known tendency to take the authoritarian path at
times.)
