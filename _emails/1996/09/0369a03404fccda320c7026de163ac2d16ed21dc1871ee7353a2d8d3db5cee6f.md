By definition, without a citizen-unit health card number, 
a Health Status Transition Event can't be recorded, 
therefore nothing will happen.

It's possible that some auditor may notice a short-term
increase in the amount of hazardous medical waste disposal
at the facility that can't be properly allocated to
health-services-consumption-units for cost recovery purposes,
but there are overhead accounts for such things, 
which are simpler than creating fictitious accounts for 
"un-persons" or some such.
