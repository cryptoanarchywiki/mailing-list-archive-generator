This seems unlikely; Abortion was illegal in the US for about 75 years
before there was any serious attempt to enforce these laws.  As soon as 
people got serious about enforcing them in the 1950s, the shit hit the 
fan.

No semi free country has ever got away with banning abortion 
unless there was a convenient neighbor a short day trip away, where
abortions are reasonably available.  (If Ulster went back to Ireland,
I predict Irelands policy on abortions would swiftly change)

Your points concerning other dangerous dead letter laws are very
true.
