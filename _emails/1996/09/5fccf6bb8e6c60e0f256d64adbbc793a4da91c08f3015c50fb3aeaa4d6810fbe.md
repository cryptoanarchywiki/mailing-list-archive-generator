Mixmaster prevents replay, so flooding multiple copies of a single message
will not work. This is the reason Mixmaster has no reply block feature. I
can see two ways in which replies can work safely.

One time reply blocks. Each block is used once and only once. Each routes
separately, and the creator never deploys enought to allow a good trace (no
more than 5 in existence at any one time). They would probably need to be
managed by some kind of nym-server. They have the disadvantage of allowing
denial of service by simply using up all the available reply blocks. The
block also point back to the sender (as all reply blocks must). This allows
an attack to rubber hose each operator in succession at the attacker's
leasure. Normal chains contain no information about where they have been,
so interception and cooperation must happen in real time (much more
difficult).

The other solution is message pools. I think this will turn out to be the
only really secure and reliable system. Some sort of automated use of pools
by remailers (so the user need not do so directly) might be possible. I
designed such a system several months back, with little response.
