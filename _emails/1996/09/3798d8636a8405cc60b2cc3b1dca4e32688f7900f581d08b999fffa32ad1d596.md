Your statement above is a loaded gun.  The decisions about what is or is
not medically necessary must by design be made by government in a
socialized medicine regime.  If I need to get in to why, it is because
you don't understand socialized medicine as well as you think you do.  As
for society as a whole being able to afford it, that's hogwash unless you 
permit serious restrictions on the definition of "medically necessary."

This evades an important point as well.  Namely, who cares if society can
afford it?  Should it have to?  Why is Joe Cracksmoker's fifteenth CBC
blood test a bill that the taxpayer must pick up?  Since when is every
citizen on the planet entitled to free health insurance?

Of course it's profitable.  Health care is not PBS.  There is a price to
be paid for getting someone else to promise to pay your bills if you get
sick.  To have it otherwise is to have a free lunch.  There is no such
thing.

The reality is that socialized medicine, in every example I can think of,
is merely low end health care.  Anyone who can afford it opts out of the
program and seeks the better quality and shorter lines within the private
health care system.  (Often in another country).

I'm not going to complain about it so long as you don't put me in a
position where I am asked to pay for every nerotic and friendless patient
who calls the ambulance on a lonely night for company.  (A friend of mine
once worked EMS Boston, by his estimate his ambulance alone ran up about
$7500 a month visiting ten or eleven such individuals.  They'd get a call
for a heart attack or somesuch and then some sweet old lady would invite
them up for coffee).

Oh, I see.  Let's give the program to the government then.  Good idea.
That will reduce the cost of the bureacracy.

And all of them buy into the notion that people are not to be made
personally responsible for their high risk behavior.  Instead, according
to these solutions, it is the role of government to identify it, and
discourage it.  I prefer market solutions.

Fact: I would sever my own festering leg before I would check into a
Canadian hospital.

It seems C.S. Lewis agrees with me on this point too.
