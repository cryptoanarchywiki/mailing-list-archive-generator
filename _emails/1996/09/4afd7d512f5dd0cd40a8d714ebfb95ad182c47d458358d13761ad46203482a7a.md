Found in the news:


	(SACRAMENTO)- The principals of six Sacramento area schools have  
received 46 used computers that were renovated by inmates at Folsom 
Prison. Warden Theo White delivered the machines after they were given a 
reprieve from the scrap heap. The prison obtained the donated personal 
computers from the non-profit Detwiler Foundation... which began working 
five years ago to bring new technology into the state's classrooms. 

[Would you want *YOUR* CHILDREN to use computers that had been HACKED
by CONVICTED CRIMINALS????]
