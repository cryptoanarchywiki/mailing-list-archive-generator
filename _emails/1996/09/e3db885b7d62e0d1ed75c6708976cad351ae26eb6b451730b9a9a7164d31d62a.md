Wasn't aware I'd asked for any information regarding your 'anonymous'
service.  Whether you believe it to be the best on the net or not, I was 
completely unaware of it's existence.

Hmm...  I've heard of remailers being run for legitimate reasons like
protecting freedom of speech, allowing a means to disseminate information
anonymously, and simply protecting the identity of the person sending the
message, but never for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY...

Ok, I'll bite..

Don't I encrypt it first with the public key of your remailer?  Otherwise,
how can I instruct the mailer which next hops to make?  And since I'm 
sending all this in the clear to your remailer, don't I end up being open 
for a man in the middle attack, traffic analysis, and just plain anybody 
with a sniffer on my ISPs terminal servers.

Ah, so I can post the hundreds of kiddie porn pics I have through your
service and be moderately untraceable?

Well, naturally.  Most mail systems on the internet have serious problems
digesting binary objects.  Oh, I guess you were expecting that I'd use 
the Microsoft Mailer...

Yet another question I didn't ask.

Sounds like a plan.  Can I have my name removed from your unsolicited 
mailing list this way?  When I start running a remailer service, I think 
I'll adopt that strategy, if possible.  Of course, MY remailer will be a 
cypherpunks style remailer or a mixmaster.  And it'll be free, too.  Of 
course, people will need to know a little bit about crypto and privacy to 
use it...  but hey, ya gotta keep out the riff-raff somehow.

Or perhaps because no one in their right minds believes your remailer to 
be anonymous.
