I have never argued against insurance! People who wish to buy insurance are
welcome to, obviously.

As to the "social safety net," things are far, far beyond a simple safety
net. When 14-year-old pregnant inner city girls are given money to set up
their own households (cf. Charles Murray's "Losing Ground"), this is not a
"safety net," this is subsidized breeding.

And so on.
