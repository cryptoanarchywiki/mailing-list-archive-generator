Did you ever see one of those mattress tags which reads something like 
"removal of this tag is a violation of ..... and is punishable by ..."?
They could tag the stuff, then make it a violation of law to cut the 
meat before final consumption.  The IRS is very concerned about barter, 
and besides, how are you gonna go half way on legislating against 
untraceable barter (other than to prohibit dividing the beef)?
