Use your imagination.  (hint: Do all states require thumbprints for
DLs?)

I have never seen the logic in this approach.  Sure, if it's relatively
easy to make a protest, then I'll do it, but going to jail out of

sooner demonstrate the futility of what they are trying to do, whether
it be censorship or prohibition.
