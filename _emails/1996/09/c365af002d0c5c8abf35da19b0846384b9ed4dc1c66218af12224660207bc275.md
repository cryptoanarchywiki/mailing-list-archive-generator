E.g. Kelly Goen is one of the people who told me that Tim May's been
complaining about my alleged "spit" posts.

Note that Kelly's not on this mailing list (unlike at least two other
people who said to me that Tim complained to them off-list) and that
most of the posts Tim complains about are obvious forgeries.
