California has it, so that's what about 20 million drivers have to put up
with. I'd expect all the states to have this within a few years.

(Yes, I disliked being thumb-printed, but I could see no viable
alternative. I'm sure Duncan has some scheme to declare himself a Botswanan
exchange student, but I decided being thumb-printed was the lesser hassle.)

By the way, the next rev of the California driver's license will reportedly
have one's *Social Security Number* printed on the card! So much for the
statement clearly printed on my card:

"For social security and tax purposes -- not for identification."

Paraphrasing that famous quote, just which part of "not for identification"
don't they understand?

(Indeed, I am asked for my SSN in many places. A few times I've refused to
give it. Once the clerk just said, "Fine, I have it here on my computer
anyway." Refusing to give it is probably no longer meaningful, due to
massively cross-linked data bases.)

Again, we desperately need an infrastructure of "credentials without identity."

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
