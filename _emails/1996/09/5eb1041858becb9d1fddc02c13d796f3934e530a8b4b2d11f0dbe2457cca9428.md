You've probably heard of the "RICO statute," or "Racketeer-Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations" law.  It's both criminal and civil:  You're supposed 
to be able to bring a RICO lawsuit against an organization and get triple 
damages.  Maybe somebody should try it and name the federal government as 
defendant...There's certainly plenty of evidence.
