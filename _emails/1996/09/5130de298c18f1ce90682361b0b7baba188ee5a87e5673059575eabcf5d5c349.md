<sigh>
Am I being unreasonable to expect at least a certain degreee of logic in the 
world?    Why is it that this guy (Laqueur) seems to believe that the future 
is filled with "greater panic than anything the world has yet experienced."  
I believe that, while there may be panic, it'll be panic on the part of the 
politicians, not ordinary citizens.  I suppose a certain amount of bias is 
to be expected, seeing as how it's Foreign Affairs magazine.
