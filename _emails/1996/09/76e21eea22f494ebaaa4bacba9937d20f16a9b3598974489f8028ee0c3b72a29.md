But since a 10-year old (who is willing to break the law) can defeat their
expat tax, what difference does it make.  All one has to do is cash out,
transfer all funds overseas, follow them, and renounce.  Move the funds
around a little.  It's not tax fraud (no false documents have been uttered
-- indeed no documents at all).  Just take your marbles and go home.
