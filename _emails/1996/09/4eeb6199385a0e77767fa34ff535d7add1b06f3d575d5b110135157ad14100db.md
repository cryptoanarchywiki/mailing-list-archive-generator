An overstatement which diminishes the power of your arguments.

Namely, many, many corporations have Orwellian surveillance systems and
policies which would be unacceptable if imposed by a government. No guns
are involved, only the considerations of employment, paychecks, and the
like.

Likewise, many private schools have such systems. Likewise, no guns are
involved.

And so on.

(Naturally, I am not criticizing these voluntarily-entered-into
arrangements, merely rebutting the point that people will generally not put
up with Orwellian schemes unless threatened with guns.)
