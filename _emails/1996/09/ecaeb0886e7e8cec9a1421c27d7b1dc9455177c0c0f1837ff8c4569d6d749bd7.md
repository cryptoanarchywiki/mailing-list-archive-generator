I'm not so sure about that.  I suspect in Kaczynski's case it was attention
deficit disorder and/or severe depression that drove him out into the woods
where no one would bother him - he didn't like interruptions and shunned
visitors.  Kaczynski blamed "leftists" and "technologists" for his ills and
primarally (though not exclusively) took out his rage on them.

This guy is just plain arrogent.  He believes he's right, and if you don't
agree with him and let him do whatever he wants, then to him you are
unimportant scum.  ("weak-minded soul" to quote him directly.)

What I don't understand is, why he bothered attacking the remailers.  Since
he obviously knows how to forge mail headers and write unix cgi scripts,
and he wasn't trying to conceal the source address, using the remailers
did him no good.  Also, he could have just downloaded the remailer software
and run it.  So maybe he really is Co$...
