In the late 30's Bugsy Seigel was in Europe visiting a friend (a countess,
I believe).  At one of her parties Hitler and a few henchmen also showed
up.  When Buggsy found out who they were he went to get his gun and finish
them off.  It was only on the pleading of his friend, that it would set off
an international incident and could ruin her, that Buggsy relented.  Too
bad he wasn't more of a hot head.
