Don't get me wrong - I'm not disagreeing with you about how grim your
points are. I just wanted to point out that information "could" be
released to researchers without identifying the patient - researchers are
generally interested in statistical data, such as the incidence of cancer
per zip code, etc., which doesn't require your name to be released. Zip
codes are sufficiently populated that this probably is of no danger to
privacy. 

OTOH, the potential for mis-use of such records is high, and allowing 
access to a huge number of commercial sites, and their employees, 
certainly opens a lot of holes.

- r.w.
