The only problem is there has to be someway for users to retrieve their mail.
The current nym server approach is to use an encrypted reply block to send a
user new mail.  This way the nym server doesn't know who the user is.  If users
have to actively retrieve their mail, then the feds could install a packet
sniffer on the remailers net link to find out the real email address of an
anonymous user.
