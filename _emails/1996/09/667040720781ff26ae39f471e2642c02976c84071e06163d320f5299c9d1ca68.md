Okay... well, in order to undo whatever was done (the column swaps
and row swaps, and the pads), the formula has to be transmitted.
Assuming that someone can intercept that as well as the alleged
cyphertext, it's no-good.  It's the whole "secure channel" issue.
(Also, some information would have to be attached to the file
containing the orignial end-of-lines for each line, or the padding
will be difficult to tell from the legitimate code.)
