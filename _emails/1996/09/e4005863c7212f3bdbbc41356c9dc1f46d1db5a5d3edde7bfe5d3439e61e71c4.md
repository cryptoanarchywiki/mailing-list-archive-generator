I recieved mail from netfree.com..
I tried mailing it back (it def. had a forged address, but I got the netfree
from the mail header.....)
So anyway..... I tried sending to root@netfree....my mail was rejected (not
unknown ...it was rejected by the system) said it wasnt authorized... so I
tried support@netfree...same thing. 
It ISSSSS rather annoying...any sugestions?
