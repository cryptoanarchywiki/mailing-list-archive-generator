Certainly, the nullification argument can be used in the "send the 
government a message" sense, but it is more likely to be successful IMO 
in a "poor, poor pitiful me" argument.

This happens in most criminal trials in my area to at least some extent 
and to an ever greater degree in drug prosecutions (more material ...). :-)

You need to know who is on your jury.  Many goverment employees, 
retirees, and housewives (who frequently populate juries) are at least as 
likely to not care what the cops did while looking at, say, a young black 
male defendant charged with distributing drugs.

Not Guilty *never* means innocent.  It means not proven guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt (or "we nullified").

Especially because $$$ is available to hire jury experts, do a summary 
mock jury trial to test theories out, and have a shadow jury.

My personal record in a federal criminal case is four hours -- from jury 
selection to verdict.  The defendant later threatened to kill his lawyer, 
the probation officer, the judge and ... me.

Roger that.
The first case I ever tried, I lost.  I was very unhappy.  But the victim 
was quite pleased.  She felt that she had the opportunity to say what she 
had to say ... let it all out ... and everything was fine.  There is some 
value in "reverse allocution."
