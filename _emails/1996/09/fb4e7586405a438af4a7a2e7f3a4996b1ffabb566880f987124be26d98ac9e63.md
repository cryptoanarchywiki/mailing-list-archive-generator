I just mean to throw the media's lies right back at them.  If crypto
anonymity is considered to lend itself to crime, no doubt by the same
logic, mass media collusion lends itself to crime.

And American mass media collusion IS a crime, crypto anonymity is not.
It's been a hundred years since it became illegal to violate the Sherman
Anti-Trust Act.

And should!  No doubt the media is colluding for criminal purposes and
shady outfits like The New York Times should be seized and analysed
by Department Of Justice anti-trust invesigators.
