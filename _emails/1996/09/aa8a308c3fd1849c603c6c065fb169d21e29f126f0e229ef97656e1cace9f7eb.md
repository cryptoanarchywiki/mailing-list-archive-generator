How about this:  do the exchange *every* time.  Never reuse a key.  That way at
most 1 message could be easily snagged (by seeing where it goes).  It'd be
processor intensive, but it avoids the whole reuse problem - where you store an
ID to be used to retrieve all messages.  Also, software could be written to do
the key computation solely on the client - after all, the server doesn't care
if they pass themselves a dud key, right? Let them crunch it.  Put all those
Pentiums to work!

...

Better idea, I hadn`t thought of that, anyone else care to comment on 
a way to solve this? - how did the nymservers do it????
