 You are being gently flamed because.

    well, I look at creative writing in a different light:

        a)  sarcasm is always in season
        b)  Dr. Dimitri is always an excellent target
        c)  if I had $10 for each sarcastic eoast in CP over the last
            3 years I could retire in the style of tcmay, rather than
            the restrained mode I am retired.
        d)  is there ever any dicussion on CP which does not flame
out?
        e)  your 'gentle flame' is a great idea.  is it copyrighted
        f)  CP charter was violated so often in last few years that I,

            and several others started a splinter for code only. if
you
            can't handle the fun, sign off...
        g)  CP's charm is it personalities

last, but least:

        h)  join the humour, or...  well, lighten-up.



   [X] you continued a boring useless stupid thread
    see item a) above


   [x] you repeatedly initiated incoherent, flaky, and mindless threads
    et tu. brute?


   [x] you posted a piece riddled with profanities
    I beg to differ with you!  since when is allusion or illusion
profane?


   [x] you posted some sort of crap that doesn't belong in this group]
    see a) above, *again*


   [x] you made a bigoted statement(s)
    hmmm, not on this one.  besides, since when have we advocated PC
speech


   [x] you repeatedly assumed unwarranted moral or intellectual superiority
    I stand far back in the line for honours on that one --maybe in
2002?


   [x] you are under the misapprehension that this group is your preserve
    yes! absolutely!  but, I share it with 1000+ others


   [x] you repeatedly shown lack of humor
    one man's "plum" is another man's "prune"


   [x] you are apparently under compulsion to post to every threat
    wrong! I trash 75% before opening!


   [?] you are posting an anonymous attack
    check the spook records listed under "Ace of Swords"


  >>> Thank you for the time you have taken to read this.  Live n' Learn.<<<
    your pleasure is my pleasure.
