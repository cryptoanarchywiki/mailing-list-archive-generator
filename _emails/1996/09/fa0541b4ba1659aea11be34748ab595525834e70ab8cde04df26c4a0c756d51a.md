Peter,
  The attack you describe is indeed possible with the Netscape Commerce Server
1.x.  However current Netscape products, such as Navigator, Enterprise Server,
and FastTrack Server, have improved private key encryption that prevents
these types of attacks.  Note that the old key handling code is of the
same vintage as the random number seed code that was shown to be weak last
year (from before I got here).  I recognized this particular problem
quite some time ago, and fixed all of the products that were then in
development.

  If someone is running the old Commerce Server, and is not confident
that the file system of their server machine can not be accessed by
attackers, I would recommend that they upgrade to the FastTrack or
Enterprise servers.
