Or they'll have to implement per-article filtering, whether done by
bots (easy to evade) or by humans (normally much harder.)
It's easy to have bots get rid of all postings/email/web mentioning
Tim May or Klaus von Future Prime, though tougher to do so if
you start posting anti-government-slander from your various Tentacles.

And they don't have to use humans to filter the whole web - 
have bots identify any material containing the words "Singapore" or "Yew"
and forward it to the humans, though that makes web proxies a bit slow :-)

Disaffection?  Everybody loves Lee Kwan Yew (or else) -
he's like a Big Brother to us!
