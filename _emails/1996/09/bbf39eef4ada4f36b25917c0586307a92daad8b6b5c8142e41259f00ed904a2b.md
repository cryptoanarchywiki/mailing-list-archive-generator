Mr. May is absolutely correct.  But let me discuss why I still think it's
dangerous.

Interest by law enforcement is impossible to predict.  It can be driven by
politial winds, and by fancy as well as unlucky coincidence.  (The drug
dealer who is busted because the police respond to a fight 911 call at the
wrong address).  The law is not fair in this regard.  Prosecution is
always selective and all one needs is an administration decision (even by
some mid-level idiot at justice) and suddenly crypto export could be a
serious issue.

In the case of the export at hand, a passport record exists, and surely
the notebook exists.  Were I a prosecutor with a bug in my rectum, I would
think I had something of a case.

This has never had anything to do with prosecution.  I wish it did.

There was once a day where confessing to sexual harassment or smoking 
something fishy would have caused this response.  Today it is grounds for
immediate dismissal.

Unfortunately these kind of exceptions are easily evaded when push comes
to shove.

If this is true, it is for two reasons.

1>  Because no one has yet told them to care.
2>  Because they find the regulation to difficult to enforce.

Start admitting that you have engaged in the conduct and those two factors
may quickly vanish.

Am I being cautious?  Of course.  Once upon a time it was ok to admit that
you left the country with tens of thousands in cash too.
