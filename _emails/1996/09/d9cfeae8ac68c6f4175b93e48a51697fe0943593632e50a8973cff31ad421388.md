Sure, but that was a particular case in the history, not the rule.

Absolutely: but here the two theories are market economy vs socialism, not
political freedom vs. lack of it.

Er, methinks that those examples strenghten more my thesis than yours:
if liberty alone could bring prosperity, how would do you explain the
cases of those free-but-poor?
In any case, I would stick to periods for which there are reliable written
documents and provable evidence, or else we'll end up believing that
faith in God may split sea waters, and wars start because of an unfaithful
bride. And I can give you plenty of counter-examples where, instead,
industrialization, modern techniques and, crucially, open markets have
brought prosperity to politically totalitarian countries that,
*subsequently*, have developed more open institutions: Taiwan and Korea,
until recently, were more or less ugly fascist dictatorships. China's
GDP, since they ditched communism in favor of capit... er, "market
socialism", has grown on average about 10% a year: I believe that in 10 or
20 years the consequent increase in education and public awareness will
force some form of political liberalization as well (but don't forget that
their per-capita GDP is still 30 times lower than Hong Kong's and 10 times
tha Taiwan's).

Regarding the Habsburg Netherlands, that was very clearly a case of
rebellion for economic independence (not unlike the Boston Tea Party,
OTOH), and, before that, those provinces witnessed the birth of two
modern financial instruments: the tradeable government securities
tied to the excise and property tax imposed by Charles V in 1542, and, a 
few years later in Antwerp, the negotiable international bill of exchange.

It succeeded where and when liberty symbiosed with capitalism, and failed
otherwise.
