     WARNING: DANGEROUS. 

     Simple advice for the manufacture of Chlorine Gas (similar enough to 
mustard gas that it has the same effect). 

     1 bottle of Chlorine Bleach.
     1 Bottle of lime-away.

     Hold Breath, mix in open container. Clear the building before you breathe
again. 

     Use more bottles for a larger area.

     I did this accidentally when I was young (16), foolish and working 
for a hospital. That it happened at work (_very_ small amounts of both bleach
and lime-away) made the Emergency Room visit free and quick. No permanent
damage, but I was lucky.
