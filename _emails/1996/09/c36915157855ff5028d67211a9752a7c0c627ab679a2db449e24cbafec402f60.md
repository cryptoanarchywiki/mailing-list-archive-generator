Solving such a problem is easy to break down into parallel steps, but
the advantage of using the infinite plane (or even a plane with "really
large" boundaries) which Tim mentioned is that you can make the search
space larger than anything which can possibly be solved in a reasonable
amount of time by these methods.  For example, factoring composites of
very large primes can also be done by such massively parallel systems, but
othe individual parts are no faster (actually they are almost always slower)
than regular computing elements.  Given a large enough search space even
a parallel system runs out of processing elements.
