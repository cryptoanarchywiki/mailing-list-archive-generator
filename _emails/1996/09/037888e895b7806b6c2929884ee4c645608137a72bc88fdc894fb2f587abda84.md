	The obvious solution to this is someone in an unregulated country
getting a couple chips or programs for the de-encryption, then making the
images/text/whatever freely available. The major hurdles for this are A.
digital watermarking to see which chip(s) are used then block their
ability to be used (a reason to get more than one chip/program so as to
compare to filter out the watermarking - some techniques for watermarking
will survive this, but most won't) and B. copyright laws in the countries
which do not enforce such provisions.

	If they seriously think this will happen, they need to take another
look at the international situation.

	That's funny, if I were in favor of any censorship it would be of
government propaganda such as this.... they seem to be calling for violence
on a rather frequent basis.
