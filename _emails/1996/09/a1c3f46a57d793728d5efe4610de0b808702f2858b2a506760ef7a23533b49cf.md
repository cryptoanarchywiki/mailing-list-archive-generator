Tim May said, in a discussion on another topic
        While BU is a lawyer, and I am not, I maintain
        [........]
Is it correct to say that "Black Unicorn is a lawyer",
or only that the nym "Black Unicorn" is used by a person
who's a lawyer under another name?  "Black Unicorn" at least doesn't
appear to be a _practicing lawyer_, though maybe [name used for legal
work by person who also uses nym "Black Unicorn"] is a practicing lawyer.

Tim's signature file no longer asserts that he's a Licensed Ontologist,
but this seems to be the kind of question you'd ask a L.O. if you knew one.
