For the most part there aren't.  Why? Well the media has sensationalized it. 
How many politicians want to go on record as "protecting the rights of
child-pornographers"?  Now, this isn't a major portion of Internet usage, but
you'd never know that from what you read in the paper.  If you only listened to
them, it'd be something like this:
40% kiddie-porn
20% terrorists, bomb instructions, etc.
15% "evil hackers" who are going to steal our money, shut off our power, etc.
10% hate groups
10% pornography
03% right-wing gun nuts
02% other (research, entertainment, etc)
