I have to agree with the final Quote....I am Good in math, chemistry and 
computer science I am good in any Logical cource but I have trouble in 
places liek " Creative Writing" I take all AP cources and make A's and 
B every now and again in english...I have a 3.7 gpa but a LOW sat in the 
grammar and english sections, 1100 in all I don't think colleges should 
look at the subjects you dont plan to major in...I plan to major in 
computer science when I go to college, so I dont think they should look 
so much at say english, or biology.  I get so frustrated in some of those 
classes....BTW I am a Junior in highschool
