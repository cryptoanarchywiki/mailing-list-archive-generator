I just downloaded a copy of the beta version of Datafellows
Windows 3.1 SSH and it asked to move the mouse around to
generate some randomness.  In reading Applied Crypto, it
mentioned that there is no such thing as generating
randomness from a personal computer unless something like
a Geiger counter is used.  Is there any way to create a
fairly random sample from the mouse? Should one use lots
of jerky movements, or take ones time with it?

Thanks!


P.VonL.
