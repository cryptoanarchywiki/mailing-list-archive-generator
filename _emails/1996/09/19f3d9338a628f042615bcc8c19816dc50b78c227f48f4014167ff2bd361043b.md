When I was acting for th--then government owned--Singapore
Broadcasting Corporation, another actor showed me a smuggled in
copy of the Asian edition of Penthouse.  It cost him S$30, about 
US$20.  As tame as it was, it was hot stuff as far as he was 
concerned.  Apparently, the law is only enforced selectively to 
make a point.
