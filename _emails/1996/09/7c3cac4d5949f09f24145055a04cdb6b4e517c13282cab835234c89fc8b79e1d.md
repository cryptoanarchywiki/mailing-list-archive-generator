Yes! Exactly! Of course!  Precisely the example that has come up in EFF's 
own statements on anonymity (which, in absence of a policy on the topic 
have been strictly factual, reporting both sides of the issue).

That's a common view here, to say the least.  And it's one with which I 
am in 100% agreement.

We don't either, even those of us with questions and conundrums to think 
about.

I do think its extremist to not be willing to even address the questions 
and conundrums, but we're in agrement on that, so not much to argue about,
fortunately.
