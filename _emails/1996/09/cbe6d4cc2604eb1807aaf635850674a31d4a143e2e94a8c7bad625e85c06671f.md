 Vulis, your comments include the following:

>Comments: Dole/Kemp '96

and you have yelled about Harry Browne enough.
LEARN TO SHUT UP! This is a Perrygram.
Just can the constant noise for a day 'till I get back
to my computer at home, where you are killfiled.
Keep it down to a reasonable number of messages
a day, or you will see others respond as you do.
