Amen to that.  Add that at least one lawyer (and former prosecutor) on 
the list is confident that successful prosecutions will ensue is AP ever 
gets off the ground.  And yes, I've read Jim Bell's manifesto.  The fact 
that no lawyer has dissected it from a legal standpoint has been used by 
Mr. Bell as support for the propostion that it is legal.  As many 
professional crytographers/computer security experts/etc. on the list 
rightly say when free work is demanded of them:  pay me my rate and I'll 
do the analysis.
