So, just what it is _your_ method of dealing with this? While it is noble
to talk about fighting the system, just how do you go about doing it
yourself?

Do you simply drive without a valid driver's license? I know some folks who
do, of course, but it's not something that's "worth it" to me.

(This space reserved for your lecture about how I need to be prepared to go
to jail to defend my right not to be thumbprinted, etc. On second thought,
why don't you be the one to go to jail, and then you can let us know your
experiences.)

"What part of "No" don't you understand?"

and

"What part of "Congress shall make no law" don't you understand?"
