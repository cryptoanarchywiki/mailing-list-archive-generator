A very valid concern.

As Jim must be tired of hearing by now, this was brought up a couple of
years ago in discussions about the pressure that could be brought to bear
on remailers.

One suggestion was a duress signal, effectively saying "I have been
compromised." (Also known as a "wave off" in criminal circles.)

The issue of whether a remailer can be trusted to wave off others, via
covert channels, is of course another issue. One can hope that additional
channels will be acquired to produce the necessary information.

(For example, full sender untraceablility means that sources within police
departments can go home, log on with the own PCs, and sell information
about pending investigations, modulo their concerns about pointing to
themselves with information provided (see "canary traps"). What an exciting
world we are entering.)
