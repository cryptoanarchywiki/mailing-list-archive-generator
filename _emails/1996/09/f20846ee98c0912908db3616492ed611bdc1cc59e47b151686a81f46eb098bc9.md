I was reading the other day about the lessons learned from the one-time
tax refund in 1975. Most consumers realized that this is a one-time deal
and saved most of it, rather than spent it. On the other hand, after Reagan's
tax cuts the consumers spent much of their newly retained income because they
believed that the lower tax rate would continue for a few years.

Likewise once an occasional gubment official in Mexico is assassinated
often enough for the population to perceive public service as being a
hazardous profession, they'll have trouble recruiting the replacements.
Assassinations won't work as long as they're perceived by the public as
zero-probability events. The public perception depends on other factors
besides the numbers or the frequency of the hits.
