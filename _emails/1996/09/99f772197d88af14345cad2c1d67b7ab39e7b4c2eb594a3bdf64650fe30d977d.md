Senile tcmay@got.net (Timothy C. May) (fart) rants:

Paula Jones is a virtuous woman. Her boss, Bill Clinton, pulled down his
pants and ordered her to kiss his erect penis.  She refused and was fired.
I think it's factually incorrect to describe this sexual harrassment as
"dalliances", but we already know that senile Tim May (fart) never lets
any facts get in the way of his agenda. It may be impolite to fart
in senile Tim May's (fart) general direction, but we do.
