I wish somebody would go up to these guys and point out that since the 
Internet is, more or less, a huge, worldwide, VOLUNTARY association of 
people, _we_ don't think these judges have any sort of "right" to regulate 
its content.  Furthermore, it isn't clear that the proper regulators of the 
Internet shouldn't be an entirely different set of people selected by 
Internet users, RATHER than the same old government system that's managed to 
screw up the rest of the world so far.

And if you're looking for "menacing," I'd say that describes the 
government's behavior towards the Internet over the last year or two.

Which child?  Does he understand what "computer-generated" means?

What about the "ongoing trauma" to the adults?  I smell hypocrisy.

Which means that he'll last just a little longer "when the cyber-revolution 
comes."
