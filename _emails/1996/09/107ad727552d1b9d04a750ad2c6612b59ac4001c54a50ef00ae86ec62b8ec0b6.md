 You are being gently flamed because.

   [X] you continued a boring useless stupid thread
   [ ] you repeatedly posted to the same thread that you just posted to
   [x] you repeatedly initiated incoherent, flaky, and mindless threads
   [x] you posted a piece riddled with profanities
   [ ] you advocated Net censorship
   [ ] you SCREAMED! (used all caps)
   [x] you posted some sort of crap that doesn't belong in this group
   [ ] you posted the inanely stupid 'Make Money Fast' article
   [ ] you threatened others with physical harm
   [x] you made a bigoted statement(s)
   [x] you repeatedly assumed unwarranted moral or intellectual superiority
   [x] you are under the misapprehension that this group is your preserve
   [x] you repeatedly shown lack of humor
   [x] you are apparently under compulsion to post to every threat
   [?] you are posting an anonymous attack
