As you may have heard by now, the Senate commerce committee markup of the
Burns/Leahy "Pro-CODE' bill, originally set for today, has been postponed.
Indications from the Commerce Committee staff are that this was largely due

to scheduling issues, although end-of-the-session politics are also playing
a role.

Both the Committee staff and Senator Burns himself (see note below) have
said they are committed to holding a markup before the end of the session.
We expect more information early next week and will post updates as soon as
new information becomes available.

Senator Burns asked us to forward the following note to the net.community:

>
>     The Commerce Committee markup on Pro-CODE, S. 1726, that we had
>     expected to have held on Thursday, September 12 has been postponed.  I
>     am fully committed to taking Pro-CODE to markup, out of committee and
>     onto the floor of the Senate in this Congress.  I believe that this
>     legislation is vital to ensuring the continued strength of America's
>     high-tech community and the privacy of its citizens.  I would like to
>     thank the many thousands of Netizens who have expressed their support
>     for Pro-CODE.
