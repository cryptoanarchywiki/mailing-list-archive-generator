Don't tar me with the "Tim said it was a waste of time" label. Rather, I
said I thought it would be pretty tough to get a reasonable ontology, one
with rich enough behaviors and reasonable incentives and disincentives.
Simulations are an art...they were useful in nuclear war planning, where
the degrees of freedom were constrained, and so on.

I agree that various cryptographic and crypto anarchic constructs can be
"faked" in a game (MUD) that cannot be reasonably implemented at this time
in the real world.

Note: Didn't Steve Jackson Games have something called "GURPS Cyberpunk"
which was somewhat similar?

Anyway, good luck and have fun.
