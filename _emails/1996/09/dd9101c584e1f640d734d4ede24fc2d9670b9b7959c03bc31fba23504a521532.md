Robert--
My sources indicate that no markup will be
held on the Burns bill before Congress adjourns for year. Not clear the votes
were there, plus the Administration had Dems lined up to offer weakening
amendments. Also, the hearing scheduled yesterday in House Judiciary for its
counterpart bill was postponed until Sept. 25; that is 3 days prior to
adjournment target, and I wouldn't be surprised if  it never takes place.
In other words, most likely prospect is for no action -- not even favorable
reporting by a Cmte. -- before Congress goes home. Administration in next two
weeks will unveil its "new and improved" encryption policy, which will likely
offer a shift in licensing to Commerce Dept., and gradual easing of
exportable strength, in exchange for industry-funded key escrow management
demo projects.

And that's the way it is (Political reality is not optional).
You can pass this info. along, as long as you do not attribute it to me.
