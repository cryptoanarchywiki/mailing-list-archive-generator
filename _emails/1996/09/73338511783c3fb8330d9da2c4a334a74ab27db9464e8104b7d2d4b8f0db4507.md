Actually, we already have several examples of how this worked, including
some cases I was directly involved in. During the Teale-Homulka trial in
Canada, many of us (me, too) posted numerous articles about it to the
various *.canada newsgroups, such as soc.culture.canada. Canada had the
choice of instructing all ISPs to halt the *.canada newsgroups. There were
no real complaints that I recall about messages being "off-topic," as they
clearly were very much on-topic. (Not that a few complaints have ever
stopped me. While I don't spam newsgroups with auto-generated spam, I
figure any article I take the time to actually write and that deals with
the newsgroup involved, by my own standards, is fair game. My ISP can
cancel my account if he feels I have spammed newsgroups in some way.)

My proposal is not to post anti-Singapore screeds to comp.lang.java or the
like, but to post them to various groups Singaporans and their neighbors
might read. If Singapore wishes to disconnect itself from
soc.culture.singapore, this is there choice. Then, the attack can spread to
various other groups Singaporans might want to read....

(I call this a _good_ use of "info-terrorism.")

Posting the Homulka stuff did not kill the Usenet. Posting the autopsy
photos of Nicole Brown Simpson did not kill the Usenet. Posting the innards
of RSA Data Security algorithms did not kill the Usenet. If Canker and
Sludgewell spam cannot kill the Usenet, if "Make Money Fast" noise cannot
kill the Usenet, and if "Babes will fuck 4 U" posts cannot kill the Usenet,
then surely some informative posts about the fascist Yew posted to various
newsgroups of relevance to Singaporans and Asians will not kill the Usenet!

Why? What is "objectionable" about exposing the truth about Lee Kwan Yew,
his feeble son, and their dynasty? What is "objectionable" about teaching
them how to use Web proxies, remailers, and other tools of liberty?

If the citizens find this stuff objectionable, they can simply not read the
stuff! As with books, movies, and magazines. What could be more natural
than this?

But of course it is the _rulers_ of these Asian kingdoms and satrapies
which want the distribution of certain thoughts controlled and denied to
their serfs and citizen-units.
