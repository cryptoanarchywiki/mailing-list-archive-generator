	Fortunately, the European Parliament really doesn't have much
power. I'd point out to those squeamish about child pornography that - aside
from that it's the production that's the problem, not the transmission &
duplication - what can be used to censor it can be used to censor everything
else. Incidentally, what nonsense is meant by "social rights"?
