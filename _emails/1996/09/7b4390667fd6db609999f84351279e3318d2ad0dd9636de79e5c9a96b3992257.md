First, the HAZ-MAT is a polymorphic virus. It is not run by any data file 
(GIF, JPG or otherwise).

Second. I had a private message sentto me from someone who suffered at 
the hands of this virus and described the effects. From the description 
it indicates the use of a possible boot or hidden sector residency with 
low level ATA-3 command capability to zap IDE drives. This is nothing 
new, or magical. 

Third. The HAZ-MAT virus has been documented to have been transported via 
a rogue copy of EudoraPro in zip format, plus one other EXE (non-image 
application).

This is not spam, just facts...
