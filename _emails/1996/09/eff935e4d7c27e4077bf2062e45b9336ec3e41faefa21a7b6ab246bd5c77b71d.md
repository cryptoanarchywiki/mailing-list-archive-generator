Come ON, folks. I've met Alexis. I don't like many things he does, and
I'm sick and tired of the shitty Usenet feed he gives me :-), but he's
much less of an "odious prick" than practically any other ISP owner, large
or small. If anyone was looking for an "odious prick" to harrass, they'd
probably start with Barry Schein of world.std.com.
