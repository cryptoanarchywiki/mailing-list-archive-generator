VNM3043 -- MAILBOX IS FULL

   The message cannot be delivered because the
   recipient's mailbox contains the maximum number of 
   messages, as set by the system administrator.  The
   recipient must delete some messages before any
   other messages can be delivered.
    The maximum message limit for a user's mailbox is 
   10,000.  The default message limit is 1000 messages.  
   Administrators can set message limits using the 
   Mailbox  Settings function available in the 
   Manage User menu  (MUSER). 

   When a user's mailbox reaches the limit, the 
   user must delete some of the messages before 
   the mailbox can accept any more incoming messages.

The mail server still has to send packets to the user.  A packet sniffer might
not be able to find out the actual contents of the transmission, but it would
be able to find out the host that has made the connection.  If this is combined
with the knowledge of the times that certain user's mailboxes get cleared out,
it would be possible to find out which nyms belong to which people.  The
current nym servers that automatically forward mail do not have this problem.
