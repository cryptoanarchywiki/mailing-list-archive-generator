Yes, a bunch of them:

1. Get a life. Learn to delete unwanted e-mail. Get a real shell account.

2. Ask AOL to let its users decide what e-mail to reject automatically (like
procmail). They've been promising this capability by the end of September.
Then you can set up your account to get no more e-mail from netfree.
