That's about it.  I long ago noticed the similarity between AP and the 
fictional Gort.  

Problem is, Gort would have to be programmed. How would you write such a 
program?  Governments would want their hand in it.  They'd insist on 
"government exceptions" to rules, like:   "All violence is forbiddden!  
(except for violence by duly authorized government employees!)"

Not very practical.
