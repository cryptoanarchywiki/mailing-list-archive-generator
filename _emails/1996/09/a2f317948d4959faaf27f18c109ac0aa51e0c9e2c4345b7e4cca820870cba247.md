Alt.whistleblowing was started a while ago, and was probably
pretty quiet (not that I've read it in years.)  Of the 5 articles there today,
one is from Geoffrey Gussis, one is a reply, one has an EPA phone number,
one is test, and one is spam.  The reply said

That kind of wiretapping we can deal with.    Forging Usenet headers
was easy enough even without anonymous remailers, and chaining
encrypted messages through remailers should be adequate, even
without the huge mix volume of anon.penet.fi.
