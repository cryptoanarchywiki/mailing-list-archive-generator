I initially responded to the first questioner with a simple "No." (Sent
privately.) This answer, because of several points:

- encrypted data, his hypo, is not illegal to export under _any_ circumstances

- the "personal use" exemption

- the Matt Blaze example, where it was obvious U.S. Customs was basically
neither interested in nor set up to process "crypto export" situations

- the basic fact that U.S. Customs _rarely_ does inspections of outgoing stuff

As I've said before, on a trip to Monte Carlo in early '95, I carried out a
bunch of magneto-optical disks, containing more than a gigabyte of stuff,
including a bunch of crypto products, etc.

Needless to say, I boarded my Air France flight without a single glance
from U.S. Customs. They were nowhere in sight, in fact, on the outgoing
side. I could have had suitcases full of cash, briefcases full of stock
certificates, and 100 gigabytes of software.

(A college friend of mine is married to a Brooklyn DA. One of the cases she
described to me involved prosecuting a guy for smuggling U.S. currency out
of the country. She hinted that the only reason he was searched as he left
the country was because of a related case.)
