While I've always admired your "in-your-face" approach to tax matters, I
remain skeptical.

What I expect will happen is some variant of "witholding" to be
implemented, where one's "transfer agent" (the holder of one's actual
stock, regardless of who holds the paper certificates) releases only, say,
60% of the proceeds from a sale and holds the remaining 40% for eventual
settlement of taxes.

(Much as one's employer "witholds" a percentage, ranging up to 50% or so,
for Federal, State, and FICA taxes.)
