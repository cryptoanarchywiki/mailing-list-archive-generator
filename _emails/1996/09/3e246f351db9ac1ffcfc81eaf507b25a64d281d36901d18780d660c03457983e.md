"Addressed", maybe, but that doesn't necessarily mean, "solved."  For many 
decades, people have been able to walk up to a pay telephone at 3:00 AM and 
make a harassing phone call to somebody, a "problem" which still exists and 
no solution is being implemented for.

I think it's reasonable to come to the conclusion that there is no solution 
to the anonymity "problem" that isn't worse than the underlying anonymity.  
And, BTW, I don't consider a pro-anonymity position to be an extremist one.
