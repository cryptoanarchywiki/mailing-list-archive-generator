    Really there is no 'Correct' solution some students function better
    in Public Schools, some in private and others in home.  I know of success
    stories and failures in each.  I had a couple of friends who were in 
home school during their Freshman and Sophomore year in highschool but 
then decided to go back to public school, they were so far behind it 
wasn't funny...any ways, one droped out and then other is just now 
getting back in the "groove" of things (he is a junior).  I guess the 
choice of schools is up to the individual, personally I am a student of a 
Public school, Enloe High, and truely hate it, I would perfer being in a 
private school but, I do not have that kind of money to spend, sure I 
could go to a cheep private school and not have the advantages of the 
people in public schools which (strangely) have more money.  I could also 
do home school but my parents would drive me insane .   But I totally 
disagree with the posts saying public school students become drug 
dealers, NONE, of my friends do drugs, drink, smoke, etc...   Most 
students turn out to be functional members of society, with a few odd 
balls ruining the reputation of the public school system...

Thats just my two cents.....
