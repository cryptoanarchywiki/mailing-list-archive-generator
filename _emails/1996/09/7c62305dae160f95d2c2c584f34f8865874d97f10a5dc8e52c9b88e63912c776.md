I never though of that.

yeah, these two are reasonably unlikely to occur together (only a 
reasoned guess, anyone got any comments on this?)
so we really have a weakish system.

Yeah, this is still a form of brute force but I was thinking of this 
in terms of a smallish (sub 200 bit) key, so brute force against 
solutions with 0 entropy is a realistic possibility.

 
anyone else got a faster way to attack this highly theoretical, 
will-never-be-implemented, type system??

I`d imagine there is some sort of way to measure the entropy "mixed 
in" by the XOR thus giving a foothold in the key, but I can`t think 
of anything right now, anyone got any ideas?
