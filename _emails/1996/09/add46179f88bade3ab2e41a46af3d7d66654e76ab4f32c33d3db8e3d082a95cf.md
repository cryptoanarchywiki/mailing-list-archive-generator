I'm not sure how you get to 60%; I assume you're talking average tax 
rate, not marginal; whenever I've tried to figure out my average rate, 
even in California, it never went above ~31%. This included a pack of 
fags a day, which is the most heavily indirect taxed item in your list.

If you're smoking enough to get up to 60%, you've got worse problems than 
taxes :)

  p.s. 

   Is anyone on cpunks working at Harry Browne's hq in DC?  Some friends in
Carolina asked me to pick up some bumper stickers and stuff before I 
leave the District.
