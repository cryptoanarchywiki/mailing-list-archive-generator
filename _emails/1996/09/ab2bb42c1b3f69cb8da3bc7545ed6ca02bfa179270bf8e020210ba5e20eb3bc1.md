It was developed by a team lead by Mitsuru Matsui and has been subject to
fairly intense analysis, although not by non-Mitsubishi people AFAIK.  In any
case it's not the usual snake oil.  When I last talked to someone from
Mitsubishi who was working on Misty I tried to convince them to make details
available online, you could try something like www.melco.co.jp to see if
there's anything available.
