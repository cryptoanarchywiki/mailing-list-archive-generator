Correct!

Just great.  That sure takes away any anonymity you had about being 
"on the cutting edge" of the information age.  That 1952 "proof-read" 
crap went out in the 70's.  How can you hope to enforce it?  It's a 
joke, right? :)  Maybe not, since it's on your sig-line.

Sorry, Wombat.  As much as I hate to agree with this multi level 
long distance phone company spammer.  He is right.  A website is an 
open invitation to comment and e-mail.  Better password your site if 
you want to solve this problem.  Then no-one can visit it, and no-one 
can send out a spider to get your e-mail address.  That's what I do, 
send out a robot to bring back e-mail addresses.  Of course I only 
send to makers of software, and my product applys to their world.

If you don't want spam in your mail box:

1. Don't have a website or don't put your e-mail address on your 
    website
2. Don't post to newsgroups
3. Don't post to mailing lists
4. If you post do so anonymously
