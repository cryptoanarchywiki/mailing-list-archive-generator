This is a transposition cipher.  The problem with this cipher is that it does
not obscure patterns in the plaintext.  There is no substitution function in
this algorithm.  Secure ciphers have several rounds with both a substitution
and transposition function.  In other words, there is no way this could be
secure.  Tell your co-worker to stick with triple-DES.
