Very high potential for abuse here! <g> 

 Under HPFS (OS/2's file system) each file takes a minimum of 512 bytes.   On
your average $200 2GB drive, that'd be around 4194304 files.  I wonder if
they have that much printer paper? (Particularly to handle those fully
qualified filenames...) <g>  Now, if you were some sort of
evil-cypherpunk-hacker, you might have a hacked copy of Linux that has some
really "creative" file systems (The fractal file system - 5 trillion files
and counting) and puts that to shame.   Even better, have something
equivelent to a source-code shrouder that would go through and create a bunch
of random looking file names (Was PGP 0e3ahjw2.exe or 052a6v62.obj?)


In other words, I have a feeling this would fly about as far as a V-22.
