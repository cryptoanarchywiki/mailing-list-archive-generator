Incorrect.  Dale is assuming facts not in evidence.  See below.

Than perhaps attacks against Dale are appropriate since he takes
credit for supporting these people.

Well, I don't know what "etc." is supposed to include, but I 
don't vote.  But even assuming, arguendo, that I did, (a) I see
no support if I were to vote AGAINST government assassins who
are none the less elected, and (b) even a self-defense vote for 
the lesser of two evils is an awfully thin thread on which to 
hang a death sentence.  Should Sofie, in the movie, "Sofie's 
Choice" have been put to death because she exercise the "choice"
given to her of choosing which of her children was to live?  I 
don't think so.
