It would seem to me that if I operated an open listserver, upon which
financial information regularly appeared and which any trader (serious or
otherwise) might subscribe, my information should be held in the same legal
regard as DJ. If not, the SEC has in effect created a monopoly for
Dow-Jones and its ilk and effectively impede or excluded other news sources
(e.g., Internet feeds) as legit means for generating market awareness, and
therefore revenue.  I and many others occassionally trade on public
information from narrower sources than DJ (e.g., market newsletters).
Sometimes DJ and others pick up info from these sources and sometimes they
don't (or not immediately).  Does that mean those trading on this data
published not yet picked up by DJ may be trading illegally?  If so, this is
totally unjust and wrongheaded.
