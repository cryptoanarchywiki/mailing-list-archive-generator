> This seems a bit far-off, but he is not the only person that

> Contemplating a bit further about the risk of being arrested,
> I thought about these developments on a larger scale. The first
> thing that popped to mind is that all the owners of the Radikal
> mirror-sites may also be arrested if they ever visit Germany. These
> are over 30 people and organisations. One of the sites Radikal was

> be held responsible by the German Authorities. John Perry Barlow
> could be arrested next time he comes to give a lecture in a 
> German city, because the EFF has illegal German documents on
> it's website. Declan McCullagh has put the Radikal information
> in the Well. He and the managers of the Well might be questioned
> when they enter Germany. Et cetera. It would be an outrage if
> anything like this happens, but friends and this journalist told me
> that it could happen to me anytime I travel to Germany.

> These acts of agression against ISP's and internetusers will profoundly
> change the Internet if they'd be tolerated.

> The possibility of being arrested in our neighbour country is almost
