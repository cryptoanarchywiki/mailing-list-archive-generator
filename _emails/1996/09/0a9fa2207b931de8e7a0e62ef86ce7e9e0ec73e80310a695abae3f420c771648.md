No, this is not what's important in this case.

(Besides, the "upper limit" is really more about the Nyquist Limit.
Shannon's Theorem says that even in the presence of noise, this limit can
be approached if proper coding schemes and whatnot are used.)

While it is true that a noisy channel can reduce the effective channel
capacity to something less than its capacity (for some particular coding
scheme), the upper limit on channel capacity is whatever it is.

As to the original question about modems and 40 kbps vs. 56 kpbs rates,
this depends on "tricks" involving definitions of a "symbol" (a la the
familiar argument about baud vs. bits per second). "Trellis coding," for
example.

I'm not a modem designer, but I'm not surprised to see these incremental
improvements...none involve huge gains, and  none involve getting, say, a
megabit per second through a 6 kHz (or whatever) audio line--now that
_would_ violate Shannon's Theorem, the Nyquist Limit, etc.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
