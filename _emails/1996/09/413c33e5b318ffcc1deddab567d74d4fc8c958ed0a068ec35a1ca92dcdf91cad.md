The semantic point is a good one, but I'd like to see an example of a
situation where you don't think you should take responsibility for something
you've said or done. I'm not sure whether we agree or not on that one...it
could be we're coming from different dimensions...

Well, we all know what the Borg think. I probably should have said
'governments' rather than 'global entities.'

My real question is whether there is a real rather than possible legislative
threat that demands action now.
