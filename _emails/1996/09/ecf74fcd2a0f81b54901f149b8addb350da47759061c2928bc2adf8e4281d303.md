Particularly since governments murdered 160 million in the last 100 years
while we civilians have only managed to murder a paltry 20 million or fewer.
A savings of 160 million deaths leaves a lot of room for a non-harmful
increase in private murder.  We could increase the private murder rate by 8
to 10 times and still break even.  

Note too that most terrorism is aimed at governments (even if practiced on
civilians).  In the absence of government, terrorist incentives may be reduced.
