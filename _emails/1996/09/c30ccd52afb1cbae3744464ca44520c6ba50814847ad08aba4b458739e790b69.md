That's why the list should be distributed (as the original poster
mentioned) in hashed format - the junk email people would then hash their
own list(s), and would know not to send to addresses where the hashes
matched. The unmatched hashes addresses on the "block" list aren't
otherwise useful to the junk e-mail folks. 

It's an interesting idea .. but who is going to pay for it? (doh.)
