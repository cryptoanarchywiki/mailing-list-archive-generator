You're right, I was too mindlessly rantish about Esther Dyson's WSJ
comments. 
 
 
However, I bought Esther a bottle of champagne in NYC a few days ago, sent
it to her table signed "An Admiring Cypherpunk."  She came over to say
hello, and we chatted a a bit about her recent messages on Cypherpunks,
which I complimented her for posting. 
 
 
She still doesn't know my name, I said I was "Anonymous." She grinned and
staggered away. 
 
 
The champagne brought her over to the side of Anonymous, that's it. 
 
 
AYA
