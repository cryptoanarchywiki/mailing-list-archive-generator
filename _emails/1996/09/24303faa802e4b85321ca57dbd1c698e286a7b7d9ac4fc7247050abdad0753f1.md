                 Can't access to this port be guarded against by a filtering
		 router which is configured to accept *only* a number of
		 trusted MX hosts ? That is the target itself *never* permits
		 any incoming traffic to smtp port *not* in the list of trusted
		 MX hosts, which does buffering for the target ?
		 Info on such MX hosts be hidden from secured way of DNS
		 setup so attacker will not learn about the MX hosts easily.
		 In case on MX host get flooded, there will be at least one
		 backup host to take over to prevent a total D.O.S.
