No, I am saying that we use MX field in DNS to specify our MX hosts, so
other hosts from anywhere else will timeout connecting to the target smtp
while trying to deliver mails directly to it, and hence will have to send 
the message to next best MX host instead, and the firewall is configured 
to permit access *only* from those MX hosts.

The problem here becomes how one can protect all those MX hosts instead.
DNS cannot hide those info properly I believe since it will mean it also
hides info of mail delivery to the host, a D.O.S in itself,. 8-((
