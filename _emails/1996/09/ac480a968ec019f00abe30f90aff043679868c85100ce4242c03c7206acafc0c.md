The key basic test of the power of genes is studies of identical
twins raised in different families.

They have near identical IQ's, and a wide range of
very similar behavior.

Identical twins raised in different families are more 
similar than identical twins raised in the same family,
probably because of deliberate attempts to differentiate
themselves.

Except in the case of extreme environmental pressures -- 
starvation, neglect, and the like, genes count for
just about everything, and environment for almost 
nothing.
