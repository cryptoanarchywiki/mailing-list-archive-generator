Scientology Case and Finnish Law
Blamed for Demise of Remail Service

By PAMELA MENDELS

The issue, Johan M. Helsingius insists, was not pornography but
privacy.

Helsingius, the Finnish volunteer who shook the online community last
week with the announcement that he was closing his popular anonymous
remailer service, said in an interview on Wednesday that he had acted
because he believes that Finland today offers inadequate privacy
protection to Internet users.

	The only thing I am concerned with is that the
	threshold of protection for the Internet should be the
	same as for ordinary postal mail or phone calls.


	Johan M. Helsingius
