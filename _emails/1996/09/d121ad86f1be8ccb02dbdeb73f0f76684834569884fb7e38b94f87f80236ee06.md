Quite true; I'd love to see the government run as a business, where some
departments might run out of money 6 months early if they aren't careful. It'd
be hard at first, but they'd have to change to survive...

++agree

How many of them are willing to go pick grapes for below minimum wage, since
they've carefully avoided learning anything remotely useful?  We have a ton of
illegal immigrants who are quite willing to do so.  The market is there, so why
aren't they working?

traditionally *raped* the ill and poor.  Nothing wrong with true charity, but
do you really think all the gold and art that (for instance) the Vatican
acquired, much of it during the dark ages,  was from giving contributions to
the poor?  Most of the time, they were the problem: "Give us money to buy
absolution or your loved ones will rot in Hell forever!"
