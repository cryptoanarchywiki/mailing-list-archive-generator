   CIAC has issued Bulletin G-48 on the denial-of-service  
   attacks by TCP SYN flooding and IP spoofing. 
 
      Two "underground magazines" for intruders have 
      recently published code to conduct denial-of-service 
      attacks by creating TCP "half open" connections. Any 
      system connected to the Internet and providing 
      TCP-based network services such as a Web server, FTP 
      server, or mail server is potentially subject to this 
      attack. Systems providing TCP-based services to the 
      Internet community may be unable to provide those 
      services while under attack and for some time after 
      the attack ceases. See the bulletin below for 
      information on how to protect your site from these 
      attacks.
