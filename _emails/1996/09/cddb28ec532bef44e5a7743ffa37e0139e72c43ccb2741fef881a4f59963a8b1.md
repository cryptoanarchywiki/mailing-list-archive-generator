Thanks for the figures and historical background. I'll keep trying to verify the
figures I cited, but I see no reason to disagree with you.

This is a surprise. I guess it would also be an example.

At present, provinces west of Ontario have not dropped taxes, while Ontario,
Quebec and New Brunswick dropped them significantly (+50%). The drop had a
predictably negative effect on the smuggling, although due to the rapid increase
in smoking rates among adolescents pressure is mounting to increase the taxes
again.
 
Most systems have undesired side-effects (e.g. remailers and spam). But if you
can keep second order effects from becoming first order, you're heading in the
desired direction. 
 
Ciao,
