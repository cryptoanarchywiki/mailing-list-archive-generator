VNM3043 -- MAILBOX IS FULL

   The message cannot be delivered because the
   recipient's mailbox contains the maximum number of 
   messages, as set by the system administrator.  The
   recipient must delete some messages before any
   other messages can be delivered.
    The maximum message limit for a user's mailbox is 
   10,000.  The default message limit is 1000 messages.  
   Administrators can set message limits using the 
   Mailbox  Settings function available in the 
   Manage User menu  (MUSER). 

   When a user's mailbox reaches the limit, the 
   user must delete some of the messages before 
   the mailbox can accept any more incoming messages.

True.  But it is a seperate program from email clients which means that anyone
wanting to use Private Idaho has to download it, install it, and learn how to
use it in conjunction with one's email program.  Most people who may have a
need for anonymity have probably never heard of PGP or Private Idaho.  I
think that until remailer functions are actually built into the programs that
people use, remailer use will be rare.
