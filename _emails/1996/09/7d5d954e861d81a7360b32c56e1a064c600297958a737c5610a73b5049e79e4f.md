Our options will open up alot when the patent expires next year.

I agree it does not make much difference mathematically, but one DH modulus
always makes me uneasy. DH is still patented though. I think I will continue
to use RSAREF, but compose the standard so the protocol supports unlimited
key sizes.

For now I think we might just suggest that the operator keep a big PGP key
to sign new key releases with. Key management is a whole nother thorny
issue. I would love to see that whole part of Mixmaster reworked. Some deep
thought should go into managing and distributing keys (it was almost an
afterthought in my design).

It is something to consider. Right now the software is not that flexible,
but it should be in the next major revision. I too would like to move from
total MD5 dependence.

Mixmaster recognizes type 1 messages, and passes them to a type 1 remailer.

Socket support for type 1 is more complicated. The known RSA key is now the
PGP key which encrypted the message. It is going to be a lot more
complicated to go in a get all the info needed using PGP. Given a PGP
library it could be done within Mixmaster, but it seems outside the scope
of the program. My personal feeling is that as Mixmaster improves and gets
more widely ported, type 1 should phase out.
