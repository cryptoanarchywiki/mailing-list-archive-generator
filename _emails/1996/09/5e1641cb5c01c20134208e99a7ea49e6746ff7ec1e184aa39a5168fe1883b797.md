	Note the usual misuse of the term "hacker."

	The author really doesn't understand USENET, does he (or she)?
Evidently, one of the persons posting the cancels was doing so out of this
company.
  
>   He said he had turned information over to federal authorities and
>   could not comment further.
   
>   In Washington, D.C., an FBI spokesman declined to confirm whether the
>   matter was being investigated although it was unclear what, if any,
>   laws may have been violated.

>   The messages were deleted from system discussion sites used by gays,
>   Jewish groups, Muslims, feminists and other politically oriented
>   groups.
   
>   The perpetrator or perpetrators used so-called "cancelbot" software
>   programs labeled with such phrases as "fagcancel" and "kikecancel."
   
>   Besides Brunton's small Oklahoma firm, Internet service providers
>   whose discussion groups were victimized included industry giants
>   Netcom Inc. of San Jose, and UU Net Technologies of Falls Church, Va.
>   Officials of those firms were not available for comment.

	And operating out of these? Or is it simply that the groups in
question are carried by these firms?

>   While some believed such attacks pose a serious threat to the sanctity
>   of the Internet -- which is virtually unregulated save for a generally
>   adhered-to protocol known as "netiquette" -- others were less alarmed.

	Usual mixup between USENET and the Internet, of course.
   
>   "There actually are no laws against that sort of thing," said Jonah
>   Seiger, policy analyst for the Center for Democracy and Technology in
>   Washington, D.C. "Obviously, it's sort of annoying."
   
>   He said a cancelbot, or a forged cancel message, is "a malicious
