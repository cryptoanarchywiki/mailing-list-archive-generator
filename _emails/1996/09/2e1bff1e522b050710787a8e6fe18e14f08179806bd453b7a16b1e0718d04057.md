I can't think of what portion of the Constitution you're referring to.  But 
chances are, somebody else will see this reference and comment.

Yes!  I, of course, agree with the latter interpretation as well.   It is 
precisely this distinction which, I believe, makes it so vital that lawsuits 
such as this Bernstein one NOT "concede" what doesn't need to be conceded.  
All they should say is that even if there are secrets which the law should 
protect, they cannot include information known by civilians in peacetime.

The few examples that exist, as you've selected them above, seem to be 
almost entirely based on military secrets in time of war.  It is not clear 
whether a non-security clearance civilian is restricted in any way, nor 
should he be.
