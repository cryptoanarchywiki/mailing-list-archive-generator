After looking at the E-Cash site and all of the things to sign, the forms to
fill and the like, I had an idea for a needed service.

What is needed is a method to make e-cash more like how someone would
purchace a money order.  If the Mark Twain bank pitched their services to
places that sold money orders, then you could exchange cash for e-cash with
assured anonymity.  A small fee could be charged (like it is with money
orders) and everyone would be happy.

It would at least introduce alot more people to e-cash...
