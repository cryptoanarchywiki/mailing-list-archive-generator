Get a grip.  Those monarchs didn't make those names.  Others did.
You're free to make up your own relative clauses to attach to
"Anonymous" --- if they're good enough maybe others'll start using

Meanwhile, *you* need to consider what reputation statements from
anonymous sources are worth.  One needs some degree of reputation to
make a useful comment on another's.
