C'mon, Perry, give it a break.  Mitnick's case has to do with security
issues as well as the violations of privacy and/or search and seizure
the government used to arrest him.
It may not be cryptography per se, but are you going to seriously argue
that security, etc. is not encompassed in crypto issues?
I found it interesting.  If you didn't, then all you had to do was
delete it.  No one needs to read your personal crusade as *The One*
who tells us what's relevant and what's not.
