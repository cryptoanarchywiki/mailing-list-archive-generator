Yes, certainly. You can bribe someone, get physical access to
machines, etc.

However, unless you know a way to crack RSA, it is unlikely that
a system using Photuris+IPsec will permit IP spoofing.

Kerberos was compromised? When? By whom? Are you talking about
Bellovin's paper on weaknesses in Kerberos (most of which are
avoidable or fixed in K5), or are you talking about a real break? If
the latter, its the first that I've heard of it.

These last two paragraphs are gibberish.

You can't "firewall" every machine -- the act is meaningless. A
Firewall is a filter designed to protect you from bugs in the setup or
implementation of the software on the machines on the inside. What
would it mean for a machine to have "firewall software" in the
operating system? Systems already attempt to prevent unauthorized
access -- the reason you have firewalls is because that software is
sometimes buggy. "Firewall software" in the OS is a meaningless
concept.
