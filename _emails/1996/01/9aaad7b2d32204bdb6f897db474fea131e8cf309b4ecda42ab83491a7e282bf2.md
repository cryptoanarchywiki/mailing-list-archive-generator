Saw a teaser last night for Friday's broadcast of the Stone and Pauly show. 
Looks like they're doing a piece on Mitnick. They did not mention him by name, 
but used some of the epitaphs commonly associated with Mitnick since Markoff's 
Cyberpunk. Which makes sense, since most of the viewing public doesn't know 
Kevin Mitnick from Steve Jobs.

I just hope this piece is better than the infamous Unsolved Mysteries 
treatments. I am not holding my breath.
