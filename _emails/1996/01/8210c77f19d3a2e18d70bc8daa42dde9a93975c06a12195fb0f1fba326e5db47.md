So this is:

Salt = RNG(128,Seed);
SessionKey = MD5(Salt | PassPhrase);

Or for export:

Salt = RNG(128,Seed);
Temp = MD5(Salt | PassPhrase);
SessionKey = 
    (Salt[1..(128 - NumExportBits)] | Temp[(128 - NumExportBits + 1)..128]);

Sounds good, assuming the passphrase is nice and long (i.e. 128 bits, or
NumExportBits) and MD5 holds up.

If you haven't already, you might want to look at some of the work Hugo
Krawczyk and some others have been doing on keyed MD5. Their application is
different (primarily, authentication) but I think many of the concerns are
similar. Look for draft-krawczyk-keyed-md5-01.txt in the usual places. "It
is not appropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material, or to cite
them other than as a ``working draft'' or ``work in progress''."
