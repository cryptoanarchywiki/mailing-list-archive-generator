I use Eudora as well.  It is not as easy as I would like.  You have a couple
of options:

1)  Use cut-and-paste into Private Idaho.  Private Idaho will allow you to
paste back into Eudora.  (Or you can send out from Private Idaho directly.)
This option is useful becuase it supports nyms and chaining of remailers.

2)  Get one of the standard Windows PGP shells and paste into that.  After
signing, you will have to repaste into Eudora again.

These seem to be the only options.  I am not certain if there is a standard
DDE or OLE interface that could be used to feed message information back and
forth between Eudora and some other app.  There have been a number of
promises of Eudora/PGP integration, but nothing has materialized yet.

There are no easy answers I know of...

If you need a copy of Private Idaho, I can point you to a web site or bring
a copy along to the meeting on the 20th.
