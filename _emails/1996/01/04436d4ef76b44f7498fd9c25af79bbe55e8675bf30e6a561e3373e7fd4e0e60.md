Fellow Cypherpunks,

I have been lurking around for some time and I have learned alot, But I have
a few questions that I either haven't seen posted or I've missed all together.

I keep PGP stored on a removable hard drive and keep it under lock and
key when it's not in use.  I write and encrypt messages on a stand-alone
computer,
that I only have access to. My passphrase is rather long and full of gibberish,
But I still fear the other things that I can not control.

Does anyone make and sell a device that emits white and pink noise?

How do you take the randomness collected from radation sensors to create
a truly random sample for creating a PGP key?

Is there anything else that I might be missing besides lining the walls &
computer 
in tin foil?   :^) 

Thanks for your help!

-Murphy
