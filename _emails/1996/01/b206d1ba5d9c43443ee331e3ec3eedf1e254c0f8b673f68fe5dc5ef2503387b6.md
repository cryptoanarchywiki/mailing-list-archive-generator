While you are at it, you might also want to pick up their famous collection
CD-ROM full of virus code, live viruses, virus creation engines, etc. From
their catalog: "For starters, you get a fantastic virus collection
consisting of 574 families [...] about 3700 carefully tested and cataloged
viruses in all...$99 + $5 S&H.

A must have :-)
