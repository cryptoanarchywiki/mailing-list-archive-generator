One way: 
 
1) Go to DOS prompt; 
2) Change mode of the permanent swap file to make it writable; 
3) Run WIPEFILE by Norton, or any other similar program, without setting up
the file for deletion after wiping; 
4) Change mode of the permanent swap file back to the original attributes; 
5) Leave DOS prompt. 
 
Another way: 
 
1) Remove permanent character of swap file from within Windows; 
2) Go to DOS prompt. 
3) Erase the swap file. 
4) Run Norton etc. WIPEDISK utility on all areas of disk not used by files;

5) Return to WIndows; 
6) Rebuild permanent swap file. 
 
Remember that one simple wipe is *not* secure. Current Department of
Defense security regs call for wiping the same space something like 8 or 9
times. Even then the wipe is not secure enough for higher level DofD
classified material. There the regs call for the physical destruction of
the medium after it has been wiped. 
 
Norton handles DoD-level wipes as an option.

     What part of "know" don't you understand?
