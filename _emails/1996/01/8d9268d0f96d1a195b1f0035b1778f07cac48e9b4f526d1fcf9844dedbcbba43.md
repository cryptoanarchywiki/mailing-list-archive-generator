So, what's wrong with the virus listening through the audio card?

Many people have their phone close to their computer, and credit-card
numbers spoken over the phone are usually spoken clearly.

Presumably mail from FV asking for confirmation wouldn't be too hard
to search for - I guess one would watch WinSock for connection
to the POP port then grab the password etc, followed by periodically 
checking for new e-mail (without the user's knowledge).


Many people would already have their CC number on the computer somewhere,
in a letter they wrote (and later printed out and posted). If it's a virus,
it doesn't even need a net connection to communicate it back (it can just
remember it and pass it 'home' several infections later).

The real problem ain't the net, but lousy security in home systems.


(Hmm, with the sound cards, couldn't the virus just hypnotise the user....)
