-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hello all,

I've seen a couple of messages here about possibilities of what might
be in pgp 3.0. 

I am in agreement that keys should be expirable. I produce new keys
once a year anyway. This is probably excessive given my probable
threat models, but I think it lends itself well to having a sort of
time-stamp on documents. Given that it is true that I could keep a
copy of my unrevoked key after I've formally revoked it, I still
think that it is beneficial to have signed documnents produced over
time bear keys that are time-bound at least as far as the way I use
pgp. 

The main point of this post was really to ask if there is a page or
rfc somewhere that describes what is expected to be in pgp 3.0. Is
there a particular reason that this to-be-released-with-source
program is shrouded in what appears to be secrecy?

As usual, I'm confused. It would help me greatly if I were able to
give people an idea of the added capabilities pgp will posess
whenever it is finally released. This isn't a flame as I'd like to
see it done right the first time rather than have it released then
see 4 or 5 different bug fixes quickly come out that confuse the
issue during its introduction. I found the FUD surrounding 2.6.x to
be hard to overcome with some people. <non-ob-crypto:> Heck, I found
a copy of pkz204e the other day on a pc in my office. The FUD
surrounding this product was pretty great if y'all recall. <back on
crypto:> I give talks occasionally about my company's internet
offerings for business. It would be nice to be able to speak of the
future of crypto with pgp with a bit more certainty.

Thanks for your time and consideration,

amp
