Trojan horse.  This is the same as #1.

Zillions of trojan horses...all the same.
I guess you can call the source credit.asm, sniffer.c, capture.bas or
any number of other names, too...geez, there's another few zillion.

Another trojan horse.

"...and type your CC# into a box that advertises itself as an 'insecure
foreign applet'" or some such thing.
Far as I can tell you can't hook the keyboard this way, just ask people to
give you the number.  And then you can only send it back to wherever the
applet came from.
