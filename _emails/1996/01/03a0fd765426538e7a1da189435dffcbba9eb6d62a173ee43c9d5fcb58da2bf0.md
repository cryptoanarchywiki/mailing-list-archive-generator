Cpunx,

This may be old hat, but now that PGPfone is available, why
don't we start an "Inter-Patch" Network using PGP and ecash?

Here are features to consider:

 * Computer users generate pre-paid phone cards for non-geeks.
 * Rate is say, 2 cents per minute, for near-real-time voice.
 * "Voice Mail" service is not subject to telco utility regs.
 * PIN#s can be changed by users, who can also confirm value.
 * Thus a user can sell remaining time on a card to others.
 * A local participant to the target number is selected.
 * Ecash is instantly delivered in exchange for communications.
 * Perhaps a 50 percent split, 1 cent per minute for example.
 * Bad participants are removed from the network.
