No.  It was not assumed that the victim would take special notice of the 
phone call, or certainly not enough to bother to try and track the signal 
realtime BEFORE accepting the phone.  Hence, crypto is serious overkill.

The phone was given to a trusted traitor, a call comes in, trusted agent 
tells hapless victim that he should talk to this person, caller 
estlablishes that this is the target by voice or otherwise, then hits 
e.g., the pound key, which triggers the explosive concealed in the battery.

The charge was shaped to deliver the most available force into the ear.  
Not much explosive is required for such an application.

DTMF dialing.  It may also have been a special frequency not available 
from the keypad, but I don't believe so.

Whatever is being used.  The installation was a totally custom job, and 
incidently, quite simple in implementation.  Never take anything from 
others without close scrutiny if you are this wanted.

Such devices on normal phones are common methods.  Moving them to keep up 
with technology is a simple matter.

Uh huh.  Sure.
