The web interface to the MIT keyserver lets you search for keys,
and probably some of the other interfaces do too.  So do a retrieve 
on REVOKE, snarf the output, and feed it to perl or grep or something.
PGP keyserver

I found that a very convenient way to add things to my keyring was to
use the keyserver web page and Private Idaho simultaneously.
Grab the keys you want on the keyserver, cut+paste into Private Idaho,
decrypt (PGP won't find a message, but will find keys), and click on
anything you don't recognize.  Parsing email isn't too tough,
but it takes some work, and it's easier for PC tools to interact through
Netscape or finger when they can instead.

n=4 is an interesting depth, given PGP's default settings.....
