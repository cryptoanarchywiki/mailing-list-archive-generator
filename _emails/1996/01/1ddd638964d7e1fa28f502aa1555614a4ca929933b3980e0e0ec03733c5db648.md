The courts cost too though.  Also there's your share of general government
overhead.  You may cover variable direct costs but perhaps not indirect and
fixed costs.

I take it you are unpaid but working.  Couldn't we reverse the process and
pay you not to work?  Sort of like protection money.  It would be worth it I
think.
