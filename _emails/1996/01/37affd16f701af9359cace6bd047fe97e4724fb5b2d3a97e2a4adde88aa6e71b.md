If I were running an ISP, I wouldn't go providing free host space for a
mirror of Nazi files just because they'd been banned (and an obvious
scan is to go claiming you've been banned just to get free space.)
On the other hand, an HTTP relay site would be a highly reasonable
service, perhaps with NNTP relaying as well.
