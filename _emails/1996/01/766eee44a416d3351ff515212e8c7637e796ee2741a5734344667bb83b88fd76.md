Hi,

I've just installed the Microsoft Exchange Server release candidate 
at the office.  I am firmly convinced that the bounce messages Tim 
just mentioned are from an Exchange server that has not been set up 
correctly.

Things I've noticed:

If the client sends a message to an invalid address on the same LAN  the server 
returns an error saying that there is no transport available.

If the mail is from an oustide source, the recipient is not 
recognized.

It's really easy to make mistakes because there is no consistency 
whatsoever between Exchange Server and MS-Mail Server.

Brad
