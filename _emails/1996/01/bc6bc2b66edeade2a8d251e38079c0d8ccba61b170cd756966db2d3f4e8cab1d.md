It is disgusting to me. I would really like to do something about it. I use
to have a sig file(s) that said:

"The revolution will not be televised but the proceeedings will be available
oonline."

During the french revolution someone said "Look their is a revolt" And
another replied "No, a revolution." Or something to that affect. But anyway
I say we as a community do something. Look around the potential is here for
something big e.g. C2.org
