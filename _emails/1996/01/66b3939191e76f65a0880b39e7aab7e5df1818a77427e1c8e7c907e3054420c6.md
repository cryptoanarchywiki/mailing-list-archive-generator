Has anyone heard anything else about this? I am getting real sick of the
media's portrayal of the internet. They never say anything good about it. If
they were to mention C2's system they would say how it is a no-rules server
to hide thugs and pornos from the police. I am getting sick of watching this
trash. The whole realm of the internet and computers and their associated
areas are very dear to me I am sick of the media bludgeoning them to death.
