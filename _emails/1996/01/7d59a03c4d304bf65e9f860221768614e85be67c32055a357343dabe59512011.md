Let me restate your cardinal rule, direct from your "alert":

How about we here it again, just because it's so well thought out:

>NEVER TYPE YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER INTO A COMPUTER.

Now, the fact that your customer database of credit card numbers
is not directly available via the Internet does not make it cease to
be a computer.  Regardless of its networkability, it is still a computer.
Do you suggest, then, that computers cannot exist without networks?

And just *where* do they get entered?   Into a computer.
And *how* are they entered?  Via a keyboard.

What was that?  You guys enter credit card numbers via the
keyboard?  But YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  IT'S NOT SAFE!

If I can't trust myself to keep my credit card number secure, why
should I trust your minimum-wage data entry employees?

>Believe me, we've thought a LOT about this.

I believe that you thought more about writing your glorified keyboard
sniffer than you did deciding how to announce your discovery to the public.
