OK, I think I understand the concern. I was assuming a model where the 
signing and encrypting keys are bound together in a certificate in some 
fashion. Presumably the encrypting key is signed by the signing key. The
certificates are distributed & managed according to some protocols and 
policies that are orthogonal to the number of keys in a single certificate.

Things get slightly more complicated if you want to update the encrypting and
signing keys independently of each other. But offhand I don't see any new
thorny issues arising.

Disclaimer: I haven't read enough of the MSCAPI to have any idea how it 
proposes to handle the purpose-specific keys.
