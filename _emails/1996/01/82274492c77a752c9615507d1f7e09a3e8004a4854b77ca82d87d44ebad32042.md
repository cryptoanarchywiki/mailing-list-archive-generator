Although your point is quite valid, there is always the possibility of
some technological advance that invalidates these calculations.  It is
possible that quantum crypto will some day make brute forcing 256 bit
keys practical.  (Of course, my knowledge about quantum crypto couldn't
fill a thimble, so maybe I'm wrong.)

These results also apply only to symmetric key ciphers and have no
relation to the difficulty of breaking RSA.  The techniques for
factoring large numbers have come a long way in the recent past and it
would not be much of a surprise for them to take another large leap.

All that being said, I believe that 128 bits is sufficient for a
symmetric key and 2048 for a public key.  Our paranoia would be far
better directed at as yet unknown attacks on the algoritms involved
or the specific implementations of cryptographic systems.  Paul Kocher's
recent timing attack is a perfect example of what we should be afraid
of.
