Over time, some nyms take on a distinct identity of their own. In fact, some
do it very quickly, a with the neo-Nazi twits now arguing in favor of
rec.music.white-power over on news.groups, some with distinct "voices". The
thought, therefore, as I imagine it would be "You don't know I am in person,
but you can count on me to be who I am, with this style and set of views,
and I say that this guy is another actual person with the same."
