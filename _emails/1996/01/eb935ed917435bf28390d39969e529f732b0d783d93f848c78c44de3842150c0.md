Degaussing the media (running a household magnet over it :-) may be an option.
Two semi-on-topic questions:

1. Does anyone know a cheap way to recover the traces of the previous
(overwritten) recordings on the media?

2. If a cheap way exists, has anyone considered stego use of it?

(I don't need this right now, just for future reference, and any such
discussion would improve the s/n on this list.)
