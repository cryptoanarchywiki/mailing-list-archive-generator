Yes, I think it likely that another case will be filed, a case the
government senses is more winnable. In many ways, what Phil and/or some of
his friends may or may not have done was too "stale." None of the Four
Horsemen were involved directly, and Phil's case generated publicity that
tended to make him a hero, not an Enemy of the People.

I would look for something like a prosecution of a remailer operator,
though only after laws are passed making it illegal to remail certain
items. (Right now there is no law against redirecting a message, so
prosecution would be difficult.)
