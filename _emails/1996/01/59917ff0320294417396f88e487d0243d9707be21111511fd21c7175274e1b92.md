   The New York Post, Jan 6, 1996. By Uri Dan from Jerusalem

   Palestinian police said Ayash [The Engineer] was killed 
   north of Gaza City when he answered a call on a cell 
   phone rigged with two ounces of explosives.

   Israeli sources said the phone had been secretly traded for
   Ayash's real phone -- and the explosion was triggered by
   remote control once it was determined he was on the line.

   ----------

   No brand name given, however, another source writes that 
   Mot runs the IL cel net. So use that neat audio-vox 
   wire on MicroTAC Elites only with paid-up Shin Bet dues, 
   absent TS-immunization.
