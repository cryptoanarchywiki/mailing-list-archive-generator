	thought that myself when I first read it -- did that at least 15 
    years with the standard unix compress --broke compress into a single
    library module, fed itfrom the input buffer and directly fed it to an
    RSA style paired key unit and streamed it out whereever specified
    --yes, it was far more efficient than two programs --and that was on
    my VAXEN (780)! 

	however, I guess they think they have reinvented the world and no 
    one ever tried to patent the process. patents are not worth the paper
    they are printed on in general --I stopped filing in 1975. I was
    supporting ignorant patent lawyers who could not even write the
    claims! That, and feds took away a nuber of patents in the national
    interest, which of course they deny as they scrubbed the rcords
    clean.... 

	so, let's see if he can enforce it!
