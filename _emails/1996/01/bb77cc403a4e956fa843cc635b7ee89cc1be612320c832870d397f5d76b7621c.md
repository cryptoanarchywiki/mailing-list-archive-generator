   Last summer the first case in Britain of a libel on the 
Internet was
   settled out of court when Laurence Godfrey accepted 
undisclosed
   damages from another nuclear physicist, Philip Hallam-Baker, 
over
   remarks made in 1993 on Usenet, an electronic conference 
with 16
   million users. And Peter Lilley, the Social Security 
Secretary, sent a
   stiff letter to the vice-chancellor of Leeds University 
after one of
   its students used a faculty computer to make defamatory 
allegations
   about him.
