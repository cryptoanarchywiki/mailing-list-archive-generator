While we're plugging things,

Don't forget e$pam, which has (mostly) e$-related cypherpunks postings, and
e$-filtered stuff from usenet newsgroups, and from as many mail groups as
the subscribers find for me to look at. The AustrianECON list has talks
about Hayek, Mises, et. al., and I zinged something to e$pam from it
recently about currency boards, fiat money and all that stuff.

Both e$spam, and it's companion discussion list, e$, are free. They're
sponsored by OKI Advanced Products and Hyperion, and anyone else who cares
to, for a rediculously cheap charter sponsorship rate ;-). The sponsor tags
are in the .sig of each message.

You can subscribe to e$pam and e$ by looking at the e$ home page,

http://thumper.vmeng.com/pub/rah/ .

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
