How about time.  We're less than a year on from the "Internet Breakthrough."
It is not obvious to the non-political that stand alone desktops or
enterprise LANs need crypto.  The "need" for the product only develops with
telecoms.  Recall the fact that hardly anyone was online (or even knew what
the term meant) only a short time ago as product development cycles run.
We'll see.

Markets are efficient but not perfect.
