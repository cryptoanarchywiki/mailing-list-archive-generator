Thanks for the positive comments, but I need to clear the air about this
"proofreading" business: I usually don't proofread my posts.

I write 'em as fast as I think 'em, then I send 'em!

A few of my longer essays I've proofed, reworked, etc., but mostly I just
respond by typing directly and then sending. I no longer even use a
spelling checker, in fact.

This can probably be guessed by some of you, as I sometimes leave out
words, which careful proofing would normally catch. I figure that informal
communications are tolerant to such informal usages.

I also tend to write in a conversational style, so the agonized structuring
and restructuring that some writers apparently feel they must go through
does not enter in to my own writing. (I'm a relatively fast typist, and am
comfortable composing at the keyboard, which not everone is, of course.)

One thing I try to scrupulously check are the distribution list and the
other message headers, usually because I edit down the distribution list
and sometimes to change the thread title to something more closely related
to my actual message (as I have done here).
