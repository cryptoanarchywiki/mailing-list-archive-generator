The first edition of Applied Cryptography has explicit permission to be
exported, thanks to Phil Karn.  It's not clear that he needed to ask,
except as a setup for asking permission to export the same material
on floppy disks; books normally get lots of slack because they look
surprisingly like the kind of thing the First Amendment covers.
(It's also not clear that he _didn't_ need to ask, given Dan Bernstein's
attempts to get official permission to teach cryptography.)

If this were Singapore, they might consider it subversive literature,
because it is :-)  Don't know about Taiwan; you can tell them it's a computer
textbook or math textbook if they ask any questions.  Rice-paper editions
of books are especially good if you need to eat them in a hurry when the
Feds are raiding you....
