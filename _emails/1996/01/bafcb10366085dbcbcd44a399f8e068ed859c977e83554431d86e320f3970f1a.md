FYI, you've got the order of events completely backwards.  We haven't
yet even written a press release, actually, though we're likely to do so
shortly.  The first news was Simson's story.  We wanted to make sure
that the first reporter was sophisticated enough to understand the
story, and Simson (as the author of "Practical UNIX Security" certainly
qualifies.)  Simson's story appeared on the Web and AOL, which prompted
my statement in response to that story.  -- NB
