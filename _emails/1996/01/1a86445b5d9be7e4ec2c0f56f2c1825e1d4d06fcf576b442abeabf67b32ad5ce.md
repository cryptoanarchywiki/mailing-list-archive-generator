The canonical story being Arthur C. Clarke's "Superiority," said at one
time to have been required reading at MIT.

I'm skeptical. Sun Microsystems did indeed buy up a bunch of Russian
programmers, a couple of years ago. Haven't heard anything come out of

And loosely-coupling PCs, for a task such as Anonymous describes, does not
sound like terribly good preparation for other tasks. No point in
speculating further, as the speculations and counter-speculations are
underdetermined.
