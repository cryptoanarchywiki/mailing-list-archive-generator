It sounds plausable.

The "bits" parameter guarantees that there are exactly 2^bits
distinct possibilities for the key schedule.  It does this by
re-calculating the key schedule as a function only of its
rightmost "bits" bits, after expansion of the user key to 
128 bytes.

One would not wish to directly limit the length of the user
key, since it would most likely be a passphrase of some sort. 

The "bits" parameter allows the effective key length to be
set in a manner which is translucent to the application and
its user interface.
