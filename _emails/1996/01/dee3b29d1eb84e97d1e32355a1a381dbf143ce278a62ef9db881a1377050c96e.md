I hope these headers are sufficient. I used the Clarinet news feed on
Netcom to get the original copy of the text. No doubt the story is on
archive sites elsewhere. I did _not_ post the original to cpunks.

The original of the story does quote Xinhua. I personally thought it
was a nice satirical touch to equate Xinhua and the Associated Press.
Apparently, my irony was lost.

Not the same anonymous. That was the AP story, and I believe is
legitimate.

That's me, thus the same as #1, but different from #2.

I agree this is confusing. I considered signing my posts "Mallet
D'nonymous," but decided that would be too much of a taunt.

I _do_ apologize for the confusion. I thought it was going to be a
nice clean satire, but the two wire stories made things more
complicated, and I perhaps did not step in to clear the confusion when
I should have.

The only reason I'm being anonymous is to protest the copyright laws.
Theoretically, my post may have been a violation of Reuters'
copyright. I believe this is the same reason why Anon #2 chose to be
anonymous, but of course I have no way of knowing for sure.
