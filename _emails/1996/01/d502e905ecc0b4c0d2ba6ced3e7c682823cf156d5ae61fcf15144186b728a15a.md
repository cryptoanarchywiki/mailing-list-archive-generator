I agree with this strongly. From my readings about the NSA in particular
and SIGINT in general, they played a valuable role in the 1950-1990 Cold
War period. (I'm not so sure a world war would have resulted in some
alternate history where the NSA did not exist, but I suspect things might
have been more chaotic and that war might have been likelier. I am thus
prepared to give credit to the NSA where credit is due.)

However, as Phill notes, the NSA and other intelligence agencies are now in
that most dangerous of positions: a powerful agency or department casting
about for something to do.

Spying on citizens and keeping the keys to their private communications and
diaries is not an appropriate option.

AT&T is downsizing, IBM downsized a while back, so why couldn't the NSA
just do the right thing: admit that the Soviet threat is no more,
congratulate the victors, and downsize by 20,000 employees?

Boycott espionage-enabled software!
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
