I guess I should offer a partial apology, even though I'm not really 
responsible for this.  Jack Hammer is the on-air name for John Benneth, who 
is a local (to me, Portland, Oregon) "moderator" for a "advertised as 
controversial" radio talk call-in show.  He saw my Assassination Politics 
essay a few months ago, and for a few weeks just before the November sweeps 
Neilsen ratings period he was trying to bait me into calling in, thinking 
I'd be a sucker for a local audience. (He _needs_ controversy to be 
sucessful.)  Since then he gave up for a while, although he occasionally 
snipes at me.  I assume his interest will wax and wane as various ratings 
periods  come and go.

Thank you.  I guess...

BTW, I sent the file to you as A16.???  That isn't a really descriptive
name.  Please change it to something more mnemonic, like ASPOL.TXT or something.

Now, now, Rich, "Assassination Politics" is not a "conspiracy theory".  Or, 
at least, it's not your classic "conspiracy theory."

What about the wacky libertarians?  Why did you leave us out?!?  Waaaaaaahhhh!!!

I, on the other hand, am out to "get" the government.  But you'll be hearing 
more about that later.
