I have no doubt that enterprising hackers will be able to hack
the international version of lotus Notes to make it as secure
as the domestic version. It is probably just a matter of NOPing
some code.

The real problem is the 64 bit key in the domestic version. This
conforms to the NIST "standard" for an exportable system. In other
words to allow the international people to have almost non-existant
40 bit security, they have limited domestic users to 64 bit secuity.
The 64 bits keys must be breakable at least in some sense or the limitation
would not be in the NIST "standard".

The 64 bit keys are probably allocated in structures and stack allocations,
so the hacking past the 64 bit limitation will probably be extremely difficult
and error prone! (To increase the size of data in a structure or data on the
stack means moving all the data beond it. This means increasing the memory
allocated and changing all references to data beond the data whose size is 
increased.) To do this in a patch, may be difficult.

In any case, I do not trust the code any large company if I do not have
the source code. Big companies are too subject to presure. What we really
need is a hack to completely substitute our own external code such as PGP!
