Rich - Remember that this is NOT being designed for usability, only to stop
a bad movement in congress.  The reason I proposed solution (d) is that it
adds no overhead to people who don't use it.  (I propose using the
Message-ID: header as a lookup ID for items received by email.  I suspect
it has spoofing problems, but perhaps congress won't notice.)

Perhaps we should re-visit the need for usability if anyone really wants to
use such a system themselves.  As a parent, I always wanted my children to
explore freely and discuss anything they found that bothered them.
