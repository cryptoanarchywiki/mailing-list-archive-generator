In 1987 there were a series of papers given out as part of the package to
CCEP vendors (or prospective vendors):
 
The Secure Data Network System: An Overview             (NSA)
        By: Gary L. Tater

        ....
                Key Management
                --------------
 
            The heart of SDNS is the Firefly keying 
            system,  which is based on public key en-
            cryption.  Each terminal has a unique Fire-
            fly key which is bound together with a
            non-forgeable certificate.  The certificate
            identifies the terminal and specifies its
            security-relevent characteristics.  Two
            SDNS terminals desiring to communicate ex-
            change certificates and keying information
            (the Firefly excange) and make access con-
            trol decisions based on the identifying in-
            formation.  The exchange generates a traf- 
            fic key which is unique to the two 
            terminals and which is new for that key ex-
            change.  If communication is permissible,
            the terminals then negotiate the communca-    
            tions parameters for use of the traffic
            key.

None of these contained any dates except the 1987 paper  reference

This is the earliest reference I know of to government public key cryptography,
and I was under the impression this was where the reference in Gus Simmons
book came from.
