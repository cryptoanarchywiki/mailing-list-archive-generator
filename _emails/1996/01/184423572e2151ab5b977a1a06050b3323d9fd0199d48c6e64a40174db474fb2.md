I especially liked the bit about being available under all sorts of
Microsoft OSs but not yet implemented under Unix. (which doesn't in
general *have* APIs or screen savers or all the other guff.

If secure input is needed then it shouldn't be too much of a
problem. I doubt the program would recognize either of INTERCAL input
or output (as a random example)

But it's hardly *new* as you say. All in all, a quite convincing
little article. Could almost be worth modifying and posting to the
Germans about something or other.

Or trees.
