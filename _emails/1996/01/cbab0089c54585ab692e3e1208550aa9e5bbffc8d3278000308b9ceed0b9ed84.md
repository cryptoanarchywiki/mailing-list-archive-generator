Subject: Potential Windows hack

I was messing around with Delphi last night, and for the first time
checked out the help files for creating Windows help. 

I was surprised to find that a Windows Help file can call functions from
any DLL. 

Is it just me, or does this seem like a hole big enough to drive a truck
through?
