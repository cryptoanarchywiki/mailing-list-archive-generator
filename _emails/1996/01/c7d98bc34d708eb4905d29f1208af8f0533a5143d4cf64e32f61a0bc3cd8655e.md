This reminds me of a 1940's Novel by Science Fiction Author Robert A.
Heinlein called "Sixth Column." In it the US has been conquered by an
invasion from Asia and the resistance (such as it is) is a small Top Secret
hidden US Army research center with some equipment that can act on people
based on their genetic makeup. Thus when it is time to go after the
invaders, it is done with guns that kill only Asians but have no effect on
anyone-else.
