PGP encrypting a file and putting it on an ftp site is unusable unless 
you have the key to unlock it.. in this sense the file is only partly 
on-line and therefore there would be no need to even split the file apart 
to various servers! Would the site containing this PGP encrypted data 
be responsible for it's content?
