It's been about a year since I've been to a cpx physical meeting in the SF
area (other than T.C. May's house meeting--thanks again, Tim.  The
AetherWire folks gave a fascinating talk).  I haven't seen much talk here on
the list, either.  Is this still a regular thing?  Back then, we were having
marathon meetings at SGI's IRIS cafe on the first Sat. of the month.  

What goes on these days?
