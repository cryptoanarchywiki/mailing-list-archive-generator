Coming off CompuServe's announcement last week that it was 
cutting off all access to "alt.binaries" newsgroups under 
pressure from the German government, I'm passing along another 
apparent development from another Internet access provider, 
Netcom.
 
Under the guise of a minor software upgrade, Netcom has changed 
its newsgroups access list to totally exclude "alt" groups 
altogether.  Since there is no way to sign up for a newsgroup 
other than via the selection menu that Netcom provides, it 
appears that Netcom has managed to censor access to all those 
discussion groups.
 
We are witnessing the not-so-gradual erosion of freedom of the 
Net.  I not often find myself allied with John Perry Barlow, but 
on this one we are four-square:  what with stupid attempts of 
government to pass unconstitutional restrictions, and 
acquiescence of the private sector to intimidation and pressure, 
freedoms of the many are being dictated by reactionary elements 
in places like Memphis, Tennessee.  
 
The next opportunity, I expect, will be to help underwrite the 
defense of the first criminal action brought under the new law.  
In the meantime, we can unsubscribe to services that curtail our 
liberties.
 
"X"
Speaking solely for myself, this time.
