NBC News reported Monday that it was a Motorola phone, that Israel cut the
landlines to the house to encourage cellular use, that *the* call came from
the Engineer's *father*, and that an Israeli aircraft overhead triggered the
blast after assuring itself (by voice info) that the Engineer was using the
phone.
