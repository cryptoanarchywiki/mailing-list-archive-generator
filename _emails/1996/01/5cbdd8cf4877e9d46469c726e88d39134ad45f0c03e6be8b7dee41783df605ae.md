What about Loran?  WWV(B)?  Receptor-type signals?

Now, I agree that CURRENTLY few people "depend" on those other (non-GPS, 
non-Loran, non-WWVB) systems, but to some extent that's a "chicken and egg 
problem"

Perhaps, but I'm assuming broadcast tv.  Single source.  Limited variability 
in path length.  I admit there  are limitations; my argument is that the 
signals SHOULD contain accurately-defined points, even if it is only one per 
frame.

I think that if there WERE some reliably-available timecode system, plus a 
cheap single-chip system to drive it, it WOULD be kept reliable enough 
because of demand.

Not much of a difference, given the context.  For example, I'm probably 1000
miles away from Boulder; it is highly unlikely that the path length
differences for the HF bands could exceed about 100 miles, or about 0.5
millisecond.  Given the context, it's accurate enough for anti-spoofing work
in networks.

Any more?  I don't think so.  GPS has probably pretty much taken over as the
"gold standard" for clock synchronization, I suspect.  Path length is known,
by definition, and the resolution must (as a consequence of the distance
accuracy requirements) be in the low-nanosecond level.

Thanks for the reference.

Chicken and egg, again.  I assume that any radio station can afford $300 for
a GPS receiver that can put out time accurate to 1 microsecond.  If enough
people start USING such broadcasts, they will be considered NECESSARY and
will be maintained.  The Receptor watch is an excellent interest-developing
product to assist in this problem; the only problem might be that errors of
greater than the 5 msec spec'd are not necessarily immediately apparent to
the common watch-on-wrist user.

I'm hoping some HV engineer will make a comment as to this factor.
