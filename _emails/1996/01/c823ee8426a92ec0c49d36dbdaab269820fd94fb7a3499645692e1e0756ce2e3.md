The reason for the killfiling is your habit of adding multiple additional
mailing list into the To: and cc: list.  I have seen more than one post
where you have added a Libritarian list and the "Democracy Now Channel 2'
list into the fray, not to mention other individuals.  THAT is why you are
getting the golden killfile, not your association with Jack "Acid" Hammer.
(Though that may help...)

The only individual I have killfiled (so far) is Dr. Fred. (At least on
mailing lists.  Usenet is another matter...)
