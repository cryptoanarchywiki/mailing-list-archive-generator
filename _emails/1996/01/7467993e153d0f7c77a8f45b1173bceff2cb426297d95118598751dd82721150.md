No.  Just because he's off the hook as such doesn't mean that Customs 
will know about it. Customs officials often appear to me to be in 
their own little world...(personal opinion only.)

I wasn't aware that Phil would have problems at customs anyway.  If 
you answer the questions truthfully and are a US citizen, they really 
can't hold you back.
