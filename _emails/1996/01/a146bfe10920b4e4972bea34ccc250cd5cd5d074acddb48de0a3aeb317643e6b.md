Recently I went out shopping for a cheaper ISP.  I found one which was very
inexpensive.  Too inexpensive.  At first I was thrilled...then I began to
wonder how they could charge so little.  Pcix.com is offering static ip
address, domain name, etc, the whole schebang for $20 a month, or $75 if
you want a dedicated line.  That's less then TLG, and TLG is a non-profit
organization.

As the saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
It seems our government friends have found themselves a new hobby.  I'm
not sure exactly what this sting operation was set up for, but I'm sure
you can use your imagination.

The user agreement is very interesting.  It states: 1) You're not allowed
to upload any encryption software (even if you don't export it) or have
any strong crypto in your shell account, and 2) They are allowed to
monitor anything you send over their network.  Spooks' dream ISP.


Highlights from the user agreement:
Section 2.7(b)
>   Member further agrees not to upload to the PCIX services any data or
>   software that cannot be exported without the prior written
>   government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain
>   types of encryption software.
Section 4.1
>   PCIX may elect to electronically monitor any and all traffic
>   which passes over our Wide Area Network. This monitoring may include
>   public as well as private communications and data transfers from our
>   Members and to our Members as well as any and all communications and
>   data transfers to and from any other internet sites. PCIX will
>   monitor our Members and those who use or transmit communications or
>   other data over our network to try and ensure adherence to
>   international, federal, state and local laws as well as the PCIX
>   Terms of Service Agreement.
