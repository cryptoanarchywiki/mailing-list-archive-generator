 Jim, 
 
 
 That's it in a nutshell: They have common interests AND con- 
 flicting interests. 
 
 AND-thinking and the identification of specific time-place- 
 circumstances factors are effectively 
 
                          BANNED. 
 
 
 It's part of the mostly unquestioned "success" of US schools. 
 
 I say mostly because 12 95 The Atlantic Monthly 65 features 
 Paul Gagnon's two essays What Should Children Learn? and 
 Botched Standards. 
 
 
 Cordially, 
 
 Jim

 They have common interests and conflicting interests.  They have a 
 common interest in repressing Chinese dissidents, to keep the world
 safe for National Security Agencies.
