a good question. perhaps _now_ they'll get serious about recognising email
as eqivalent to postal mail. this would be an excellent way of pushing this
elsewhere. when _their_ ox is gored, they'll scream like stuck pigs. 

one interesting aspect of this would be whether regular mail is considered a
public record under the law as far as legislooters mail goes. if so, then
she should get it.
