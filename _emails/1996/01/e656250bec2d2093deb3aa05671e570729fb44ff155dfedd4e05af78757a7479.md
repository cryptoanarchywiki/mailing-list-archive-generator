I did the optimizations by hand.  Simple rules of boolean arithmetic 
and logic (you know, things like Demorgan's Law applied to binary 
operations).  Other processor-related optimizations can be done by 
hand, such as add x,x instead of shl x,1.

I think I had the same proglems with F2 as well.  Couldn't find a way 
to optimize it reasonably.

You might do some creative optimization to use more registers than it 
does.  I haven't looked at it in a while.  The code was so huge and 
slow compared to optimized MD5 and SHS that I have up using it for an 
unfinished encrypted file system.
