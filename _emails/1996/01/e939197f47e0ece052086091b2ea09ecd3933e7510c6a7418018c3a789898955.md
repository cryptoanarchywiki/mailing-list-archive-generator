I saw all the posts regarding this and proclaiming it to be false.  I
feel obligated to point out a discussion we had at work last week about
our news feeds (I work for an ISP).  Our news machines are constantly
filling up, and we can only add so much disk-space to the news spools.
We have been reducing the expire times, and the news spools are still
filling up too fast.  40%, I think it was, of the news was alt.*.  I
suggested (Bad, Mike!) that we kill all the alt.* groups, and add back
only those that people customers actually request.  The whole
engineering group jumped down my throat saying that that action would
be seen by the customers, and potential customers, as censorship.  I
withdrew my proposal, because I agreed with them.

The reason I bring this up is to point out that the removal of the
alt.* groups does not necessarily mean the people removing those groups
are trying to censor anything, but may just be trying to reduce the
resources eaten by news on their systems and network.
