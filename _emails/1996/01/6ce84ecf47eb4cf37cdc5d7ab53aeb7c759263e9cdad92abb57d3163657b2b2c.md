I'd say _all_ news, not just software news, is P.R. controlled, these days.
You can largely hold Edward L. Bernays, the "father of public relations"
(who just died last year) responsible for that--or the societal conditions
that allowed Bernays to do his thing.  Bernays developed expertise in
"engineering of consent" turned the news into a commercialized and
manufactured commodity.  As the NYT magazine "people who died last year"
blurb on him said, maybe once you could trust that the news you read was
something that a reporter or editor independently decided was newsworthy.
Now, the news you read is manufactured in press releases to sell a product,
and is there because a well written press release convinced a reporter or
editor that a marketting ploy was actually a newsworthy event (or, perhaps,
because the advertising dollars that went along with the press release
convinced him).  Witness FVs demonstration of key capture becoming a
newsworthy event.

If you want to effect what's in the media, maybe you should learn how to
issue press releases.

Yup.   Throw the government into the mix too, and I think you've got a
pretty good model of the media.
