	no way is that patent valid. I have prior art going back into the
    early 80s where I converted the standard compress into a stream processor
    followed by a stream encryption engine --obviously the reverse as well.

	now, that's back in time when I had two 750s in my garage and 9T
    tape! I've had it on the list to find for some time; I still have
    two tape drives (one will hopefully still work) and an old uvaxen 
    which I saved for such emergencies. It also might be on tapes from 
    my then current desktop: a Sun 2!  

	At the moment, I'm not terribly interested in the problem, but
    will be, hopefully soon. Basically, if it comes to that, they had
    better have their act ready to pay litigative costs  --I do my own
    (with a perfect record, better than patent attorneys I have hired),
    and I rather enjoy playing by the rules of the law, rather than playing 
    by the game rules of the bar.

	and, I do not believe I am alone; there are others who have used 
    stream processing for that purpose.  I started playing with rsa 
    shortly after in was published in SA in 1977 --however, significant
    computing power was not cheap at that time --seems to me I paid
    about $30K for an 11-44 with 2 rl02 drives!
