Yes, you're absolutely right.  It would be great if some entrepreneur could
buy a T1, put up a 2000 MHz (or somewhere around that; whatever frequency
was allocated appropriately) local "cellular" data system which would be
able to connect to up to, say, 100 simultaneous  or so local users using
modems little more complicated than a current 900 MHz cordless phone.  Okay,
maybe all this stuff is already being worked on at a few dozen or hundred
companies around the globe, but I can't wait...

Question:  Is this the "Qualcomm" that does the Internet access software, or
the "Qualcomm" who builds the wireless amps/filters/hardware/etc?   Or is it
all the same company?!?
