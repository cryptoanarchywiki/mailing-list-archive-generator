I don't think "pro-Clipper" properly characters the enemy.

Clipper is chip used in a voluntary federal standard.  If we had
sufficient civil liberties guarantees, I bet even a lot of
c'punks wouldn't object to govt agencies using clipper chips.

But the Freeh/Denning position, as I understand it, is that:

* privacy is not a right
* the govt should routinely spy on citizens
* strong crypto should be illegal
* no public debate on the underlying issues

Are there other computer scientists with this position?

Roger
