Infrared and laser are not very reliable between buildings during fog.
Between your house and your neighbor, a low cost 900MHz bridge would be the
best way to go. On such short distances, an omni-directional antenna will
work just fine. Check out Solectek (cheaper) or Cylink (faster). Both offer
DES link encryption.
