I agree that there is a legitimate public interest in the records (recall 
the dispute when the White House planned to delete all emails, leaving no 
backups, during a change of Administration).  That doesn't mean that spin 
can't be placed on the news.  What if Congress decided to reduce its 
salary by 28% and exempt its members from filing tax returns -- to save 
wear and tear on IRS computers and service centers?

My point, however, is that privacy advocates can, and should, use their 
own equivalent of the Four Horsemen (tm) in making their arguments to the 
masses.  I can't recall a single statement as short and catchy as 
the pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, and money launderers 
argument the FBI uses.  Tim's (?) "Four Horsemen" idea cleverly attempts to 
turn the argument on its head, but I fear that his implicit statment will be 
lost on those with less background on why privacy is important.   

Demagoguery frequently works, even if it can be distasteful.  And short 
catchy ideas sell.  Remember that Miami Vice was described in the 
beginning stages as "MTV Cops" and the network bought.

Should the same policy apply to altavista?  (I recognize the difference, 
just throwing grenades!)

I'm assuming the email was in a closed system, not on the net ...

Absolutely.  Different spins/messages for different audiences.  Just like 
the politicians.  I think the crowd may be broader than the Cypherpunks 
list, however.
