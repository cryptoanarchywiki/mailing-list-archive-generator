-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
 
	Here is the RC4 cipher for the HP-48 calculator.  It 
complements the DES implementation by William E. Sommerfeld.  
RC4 has a higher throughput than DES, but its key setup is 
slower.  The key may be up to 256 characters (2048 bits) -- 
the maximum supported by the RC4 algorithm.
 
Here are sample timings for a HP-48GX.  The SX will be 
correspondingly slower.
Key Setup (200 bits)     25.18 sec
RC4 throughput            5.06 cps
String to Array          61.83 cps
Array to String          56.12 cps
 
	The HP-48 comes with a 2400 baud IR link and a 
1200/2400/9600 baud RS232 port.  The 48S, 48SX and 48G have 
32Kb of RAM, almost none of which is used by the operating 
system.  The 48GX has 128Kb of RAM.  With an entry price of 
~100$ US, I feel that the HP-48 series would be a good choice 
for a smart token.  Possible uses are as digital cash wallets 
and authentication tokens, not the mention simple encrypted 
dumb terminals.
 
Installation:
 
	If you have a serial cable, download the code below to 
your HP and call it 'RC4'.  This will create a directory 
called 'RC4' with four programs in it.  If you don't have a 
cable you can type the whole thing in; it's not too large.  
Store it as 'RC4' and again it will create a directory.  Remember
not to type the "%%HP: T(3)A(D)F(.);" -- it's only needed for
a serial download.
 
Instructions:
 
	These instructions assume that you are familiar with 
stream-ciphers in general.  If you are not, you might want to 
get _Applied Cryptography_ by Bruce Schneier from your library 
or book store.
 
	Bit streams are represented as one dimensional arrays of 
real numbers between 0 and 255.  Yes, that's right, this 
cipher uses floating-point!  In User-RPL it's the fastest way.  
To convert between strings and arrays use the commands S2A and 
A2S.
 
	S2A     "String" -> [Array]
	A2S     [Array] -> "String"
 
	To setup a key, use the SK command.  It takes a 
bitstream representing the keytext and returns the key 
context.  They keytext can be up to 256 bytes long.  
Additional bytes will not be used.  The key context is another 
bitstream with 256 values in it.  Because of time/memory 
tradeoffs, a key context takes 2082 bytes of RAM to store.  If 
memory is tight, use A2S to compress the key context to a 
string.
 
	SK      [Key text] -> [Key context]
 
	To encrypt something use the RC4 command.  The first 
argument is the key context, the second is the plaintext or 
ciphertext, both in bitstream form.  It returns the updated 
key context and the ciphertext or plaintext.
 
RC4     [Key context], [Plaintext] -> 
	   [New key context], [Ciphertext]
or
RC4     [Key context], [Ciphertext] -> 
	   [New key context], [Plaintext]
 
Enjoy
