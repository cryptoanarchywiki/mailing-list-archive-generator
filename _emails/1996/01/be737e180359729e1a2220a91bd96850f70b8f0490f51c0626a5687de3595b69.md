Ok.  Fair enough.  Good points.

Personally, what I found most distasteful about FV's post was their
conclusions, not their experimental procedure.

I agree that their keyboard-sniffer lends more evidence to the well-known
argument that, to make good use of crypto, you need secure endpoint machines.

I disagree when FV concludes that this makes crypto useless.  Instead, I'd
contend we just need to work to secure our endpoints better; then we can do
all sorts of neat stuff with crypto.

I found their conclusions to be academically displeasing.  But I guess
that's what happens when you're trying to sell a product...
