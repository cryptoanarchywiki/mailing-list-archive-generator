For anotehr view suggesting that Rosen is himself dazzled by superstars,
see The Other Path, by Hernando de Soto, ISBN 0-06-091640-0 (paperback)
and 0-06-016020-9 (hard). 

This is the 260-page executive summary of a study of the "informal
economy" in the major Peruvian cities. I think the expanded El otro
sendero with statistical appendices is only available in Spanish. 

Title refers to Sendero Luminoso, a particularly bizarre Maoist cult that 
has been brutally repressed by Fujimori in recent years. De Soto argues 
that the masses are a lot smarter than most economists and governments 
think, that most humans are entrepreneurs, and that the informal economy 
serves people a lot better than either Fordist capitalism or a "communist"
revolution.

As if anyone has time to read such a thing.
