The snoop program is using FTP to find out the user's e-mail
address.  The image on the page is an ftp: URL.  Our FTP code
was sending the user's e-mail address as the password for
anonymous FTP, which is the usually requested by FTP sites.
The perl script was waiting for the FTP to happen, and then
looking at its log to figure out the email address.

  I've removed the code that uses the e-mail address as the
FTP password for anonymous FTPs.  You can still enter it by
hand by using a URL of this form 'ftp://anonymous@ftp.netscape.com'.
This will cause the navigator to prompt the user for the 
password to send for anonymous.  This is a little known feature
that will also allow users to access non-anonymous ftp
accounts via netscape.

  The fix for this will be in the next beta, and the final
version of 2.0.
