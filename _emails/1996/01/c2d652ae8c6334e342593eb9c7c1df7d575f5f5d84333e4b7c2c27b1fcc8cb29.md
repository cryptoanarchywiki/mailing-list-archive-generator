   I _am_ a GEnXer, and I worshipped Jules Bergmann as a child. Some
of my first memories is pressing my nose up to the tv, watching Saturn
V's lifting off. If I ever win the lottery, I'm going to take the Saturn that's 
lying on it's side at Cape Kennedy, refurbish it, and launch that baby 
just to watch it go. ;-)))
