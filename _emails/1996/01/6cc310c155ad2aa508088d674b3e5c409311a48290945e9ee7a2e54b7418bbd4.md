Actually ratings do not apply in this case.  KKEY does not subscribe to the
ratings service.  (Never has, to my knowledge.)  KKEY is a part time
station.  It has never had much of a broadcast range.  (And never will, as
their equiptment causes interfearence with neigboring phone equiptment and
the like.) It is supported by advertising which is pitched by the talk show
host themselves.  It has never had much of an audience. The talk show hosts
run the gamut from  conservitive to very conservitive.  (The former owner
had a habit of firing hosts on the air if he did not like their views.  But
Ralph is dead now...)  It has a very bad reputation in Portland as being a
station for neo-nazis, whackos and cranks.

(Back in my conservitive days i had friends who worked there.  It was an
"interesting" experience.)

I think he is collecting stuff he thinks of as whacky theories.

I think he is collecting stuff that is just "whacky".
