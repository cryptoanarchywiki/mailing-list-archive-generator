Better yet, specifically point to those who should be held
accountable and list the names, addresses, email address, etc. of all 
those who are involved.

Even better, where practical build into the software an option (that
you could turn on/off) which would email every piece of information
that you encrypted directly to the congressman as a kind reminder of
their position.  [This is a joke: spamming is not a good way to deal
with the issue.]
