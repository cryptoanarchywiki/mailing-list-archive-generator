I just got back from the AFCEA show.  Lotus was there demonstrating
Lotus Notes V4 DMS (Defense Messaging System).  They've hacked it to
be DMS complaint (I think that that means mostly that they support
X.400 addressing, X.500 directory services and use a Fortezza card to
encrypt and sign)...

There are a lots of folks involved in the DMS game.  Loral is the prime
contractor.  ESL, Lotus and Microsoft are providing UA's (front ends).
