   Today's fourth article of The Washington Post series on "The
   Politics of Mistrust" is:

   "Public Grows More Receptive to Anti-Government Message."

     The public sees the quality of life deteriorating or not
     improving from the 1960s, with family breakup, increased
     violence, a failure to produce better jobs, and, in 
addition,
     with the Cold War over, they don't see any real reduction 
in
     the risks of the possibility of a third world war. All 
this
     occurs at a time when taxes have been increasing. The 
small
     government, low tax environment creates a real opportunity 
for
     Republicans.... The general force of this sense of no 
progress
     is to favor the more conservative party.
