It isn't just an issue of SSL vs. unprotected. The new Ecash API that
DigiCash is jointly designing with developers, will support two basic
levels of operation. The first is similar to today's Ecash software. The
client handles the transport. The second just generates the messages. Your
application is responsible for getting them to where they should go.
Presumably securely.

Given the amounts likely to be found on a drive, I doubt it would be worth
the effort.
