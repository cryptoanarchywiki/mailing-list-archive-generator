I guess that it would depend upon your definition of 'withdraw'. If you 
say that money is withdrawn when it is on your hard drive, what you say 
is true. However, if the money is 'withdrawn' when it is returned to the 
'bank' for 'clearing it could still earn interest. Of course, this is 
predicated on an e-cash/check analogy that requires specific clearing. In 
any case, at some point, this stuff has to be turned into 'real money'.
