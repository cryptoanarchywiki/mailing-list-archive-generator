Yes, a client that cache's DNS queries can get in the way somewhat.  I've
already considered this, and the "devious applet" would take advantage of Java's
capability to use multiple threads (one of which would sleep() for whatever
period of time was necessary to invalidate the cache, and _then_ initiate the
attack.)  Yes, there are are various other specific cases that need to be
considered in order to make the attacking app (if it's even feasable) work all
of (or a good percentage of) the time.

It would be very easy to conceal the "devious" portion of the applet inside of
trojan horse that ran for a length of time greater than the minimum TTL for DNS
caching.
