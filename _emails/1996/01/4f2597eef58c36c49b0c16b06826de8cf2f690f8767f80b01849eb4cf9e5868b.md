       I *think* the only thing that's been affirmed, is that the feds 
can *tax*  weapons transfers.     I think the one particular case is 
called "Rock Island" or something like that. The defendant was 
*acquitted* of possessing an un-registered machine gun, because the 
authority to tax transfers of newly-manufactured machine guns, no longer 
exists. This is an over-simplifaction. Anyway, the point is, the 
defendant was acquitted right there in district court.

Tim, I don't think you'll be able to find anything in the Code of federal 
Regulations or the United States Statutes, which outlaws the manufacture 
or possession of a fission device in your basement.  I'm not even 
positive if it fits the legal definition of a "destructive device", whose 
*transfers*  are taxed.
