You're disagreeing that I invented safe-tcl?  You disagree that I sent
you and Ousterhout the very first message that said I want to strip out
the dangerous commands?  That I created the mailing list and then gave it
up becuase you and Rose "took over" the concept while only releasing a
safe-Tk, leaving off the embeddeable server part? Must we go to the
archives?  You're disagreeing that without enabled mail FV would probably
not have happened?

IF so, then one of us is delusional and it's not me, kiddo.

PS:  Sorry C-P folks.  In penance for this off-topic probably-uneeded
defense against Nathaniel's attack, I will compare the Usenet RC2
against the licensed code and tell you what I find.  -r$
