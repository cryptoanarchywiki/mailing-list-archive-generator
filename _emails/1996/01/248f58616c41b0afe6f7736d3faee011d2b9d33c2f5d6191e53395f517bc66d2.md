That's a pretty large aside !

I am definitely not "Futplex" in many places I go, and often I am not anyone 
in particular.

I am doubtful. I can't vouch for the identities of very many people on this 
list. (I've even met, e.g., Lucky in person and I certainly have no clue
what his verinym might be, nor do I particularly care.) On the other hand, I
am willing to sign onto all sorts of judgements about the trustworthiness of
various people on the list, and other aspects of their reputations. I've
driven hundreds of miles based on trust developed online with people whose
identities I still haven't verified. I've even agreed to loan hundreds of
dollars to someone I knew only as an online pseudonym.

I am swayed by the view expounded by Carl Ellison that a key, not an
identity, should be the anchor to which attributes are attached. (Sorry if
I am misstating or oversimplifying the position here.) I think identity 
should be hung off the key as just another (optional) attribute.

I think your comments apply pretty well to trust relationships in the flesh,
but don't fully take the net into account.
