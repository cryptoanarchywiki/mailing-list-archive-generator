Not knowing a law doesn't mean that I'm not liable for breaking it.

Denying the holocaust is not 'something offensive to the German
government' but something that hurts the feeling of the people whose
relatives were murdered by the Nazis.

Free speech ends where other people can reasonable claim that their
feelings are badly hurt.

Is it constitutionally protected in US to knowingly hurt other
people's feelings and to trample on graves?????

Interesting question.  I assume from a formal standpointyou were, but
practically it might not be possible to proof that you sent the
message.

Mike's information is old.  Meanwhile it's explicitely forbidden to
deny the holocaust.

As said above: the law is explicite.  When I trade with another
country of course I have to obey this country's laws.  I mean if I
visit US I have to obey US-law.  If I know it or not.  If you visit
Germany, you have to obey German law.  If you know it or not.  The
same is with trade.

He imported illegal stuff into Germany.  If I import weapons to US
without a licence I might be imprisoned on my next visit there, too.


Due to our history publishing NAZI-propaganda is forbidden in Germany.
The big majority in Germany agrees with this view, that
NAZI-propaganda doesn't fall under 'free speech'. Some neo-NAZIs
publish their books in other countries and then illegally transfer
them to Germany.

BTW, many European countries forbid publishing NAZI-propaganda.  And
as far as I know Denmark plans to change their law, too.

How do you know that they know?  How do you know that the guy in
question didn't know?
