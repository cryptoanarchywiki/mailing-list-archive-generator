Sorry, I thought of this months ago :-) But there is an even better
business opportunity out there. Wireless T1 service covering a whole
downtown area. I speced the whole system for the last company I worked for
before they ran out of money. My calculations show that you can deliver
close to T1 speed to corporate customers at fraction of the cost using land
lines. In the best case scenario, you can produce the individual connection
at below $200. No land line based ISP can ever touch that. The total cost
for a land line based IPS is at least $395/T1. Set-up fee is lower too.
Best, the whole thing can be set up self financing. If I wasn't so busy
with other projects, I'd implement it myself.
