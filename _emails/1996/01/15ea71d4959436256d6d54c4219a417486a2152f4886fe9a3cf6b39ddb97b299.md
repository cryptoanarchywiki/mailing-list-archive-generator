For as long as they're able to provide information and services that
customers want, which are not available via "generic" small ISP's.

For example, one can read the New York Times (and many other periodicals)
via AOL; one can read the NCSA forum on CompuServe.

One has to be pretty dumb to use AOL or CS as an _Internet_ provider.
Yet a lot of very sharp people use these services.

The content providers aren't willing to put their wares on "generic"
internet, and won't be willing to in the foreseeable future.
