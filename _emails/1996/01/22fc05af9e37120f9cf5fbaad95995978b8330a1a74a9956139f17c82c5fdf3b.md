I have a tiny correction to Bill's assumption and that of a few
others who have commented on "white slavery."  The laws in 
question were concerned with prostitution, not kidnapping or 
rape.  The term "white slavery" arose because the social fiction
was that these women could not possibly have been prostitutes by
choice, they must have been forced into it by others.  A current
variation of this thinking is promoted by some anti porn
"feminists" with regard to women in the adult movie industry.

own free will.")

Plus ca change . . .
