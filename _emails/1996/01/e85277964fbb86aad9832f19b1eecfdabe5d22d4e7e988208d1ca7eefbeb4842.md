Or for that matter that the present ones will never get implemented.

Poor prof Denning...It strikes me as though her essay is a close 
relative of "Reefer Madness", a supposedly hilariously rabid (I'm told)
anti-pot video which only potheads ever bother watching. The only people
who will read her webpage are us cypherpunks. Should by some 
randomly-generated act of pot luck, anyone other than us read her ~38 pg.
rant, that person (non-LEA, of course) will probably be entertained enough
to join the list and read Tim's writings (only a search engine away).

It is also convenient that most of the search engines list multiple 
occurences of the list archives, every time a search on cryptography
keywords is performed. (The archives don't list the majordomo address, could 
this be the reason why we constantly get so many "subscribe me!" posts? 
Waaay to go Dorothy!)

Somehow, I don't think her choice of medium is going to get her very far.
I wonder what a second edition of her crypto book would look like.
