Not at all.  I'm worried about similar respnses to my original post given my
instable base.  :)

I don't pretend to understand how every system on the market works, especially
those that have "PC" somewhere in their offficial or onufficial name.

# If you're talking about Windows NT or 95, for example, the winsock.dll

# itself. I think TTL is listened to.

[See the caveat above.]

# wsock32.dll, on the other hand, doesn't do central DNS caching. So
# applications implement it themselves. I'm not sure that applications even

# probably time out DNS lookups differently. 

The thing to remember, with Java is that it's "platform independant" and thus
the security of Java as a whole will be the product of its parts.

# Real operating systems are probably a bit more standard about what they 
# do with DNS lookups, but I'm sure there's variance.

There is.  Actually its "real OS's" that I worry about most.  If you run
idenmtd, it might be possible for a java applet to determine who invoked it.
If fingerd (or any other service) allows and responds to connections from
127.0.0.1 (ie. localhost...)

I didn't state it explicitly, but that's exactly my point.

# This bait & switch thang can really be generalized to any kind of attack. 
# Of course, it's traceable, since not that many people own or can spoof a
# DNS server. 

Traceable by what?  If my assumptions are correct (which I'm willing to admit
that they might not be) all the attacker has to spoof is name to address for a
name that he/she already controls.  I don't expect that most PCs and/or
Macintosh's do this as a matter of course.  Most firewalls probably do, but I
wouldn't count on it.
