I hate to be the bearer of bad news, and I try to resist forwarding

They claim that since voice can be transmitted over the Internet, it falls
under the jurisdiction of the FCC.

Read about it in the Dec. 18 issue of Interactive Week
( http://www.zdnet.com/~intweek/print/951218/upfront/doc11.html)

I would hope that we would flood them with comments during the period
after the "Notice of Proposed Rule-Making" appears, not that it will
help, as they have already made up their minds. The FCC (like the FDA)
should be defunded, not just "cut," whatever that word means anymore.
There are good economic reasons why this won't help "universal access"
any more than peanut subsidies help minority farmers, despite lies to
the contrary by various self-interested bureaucrats. As Republicans
said (before they became the majority party) "Cut Their Pay and Send
Them Home."
