Immediately after posting my message on press queries re AU and PZ, Perry
Metzger's post hit.

I wrote in the previous post that I do not think that AU adopted a
responsible method of getting answers to his questions. I think that Perry
did. 
 
Of course the question by both people was (in a limited sense) the same. So
was the importance of the question. 
 
But the method that Perry adopted was much more responsible. I suspect it
is also more likely to elicit an answer to the question.
