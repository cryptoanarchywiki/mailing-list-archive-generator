I did say "many," not "most," and I would assume that most if not all
stuff that The Economist carries is completely legit. I'd been thinking of
"other publications," such as the tax protester rags and my friend 
Clark's paper.

Yep, I'm just an FBI plant. (Yes, I know -- or rather assume -- that
that's not what you meant.)

Be careful of this paranoid stuff, even as a joke. The tax protester
movement feeds on conspiracy BS. "The IRS knows that native born white
Sovereign Citizens don't have to pay Federal taxes, but they've paid off
all the Jew lawyers." There was a guy in misc.legal a while back making
this so-called argument. People were actually sending him money, and not
out of pity. 

Which is not to say that the guvmint isn't conspiring against us all, in
the larger and some specific senses. Just not quite like that, and it's
the wacky conspiracy theories that make otherwise intelligent people
discard others. (Some people still don't believe in Watergate. *I* didn't
believe the Feds could legally get a wiretap without a warrant until I 
was corrected here.)

This falls under the category of Things That Only The Mega-Wealthy Clique
(of all races, politics, and sexual colors) Know. 

Which is a category that shrinks more and more by the day. Some people
actually used to believe in the Divine Right of Kings. We've come a long
way, baby. Keep it up.
