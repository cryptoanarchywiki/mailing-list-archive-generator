    You just don't get it, do you?  Do-gooders like the Wiesenthalistas 
don't need to be *right*; they need *a steady stream of cash contributions*

No one had ever heard of Farrakhan, until the ADL starting pumping out
press releases, attacking him by name. But Farrakhan was cleverer than
than Abe Foxman, who makes six figures as the head of ADL; Farrakhan used
the publicity to his financial advantage. Farrakhan now works the college
lecture circuit; even better, he hires sports arenas and fills them up
with lower-middle class blacks who are willing to pay the price of a
ticket, to see Whitey get sassed in public. 

"You can say anything you want about me, as long as you spell my name right".

It is a metric of AMerica's wealth, that we have a whole class of 
individuals who can make a living by being the interlocutors in political 
show biz.
