Sure. That is the obvious approach. It also is, IMHO, by far the best. One
minor problem is that the blind signature technology has been patented by
its inventor, David Chaum the ower of DigiCash. You can't just write your
own implementation. You also don't need to. Just use DigiCash's Ecash for
postage. There is some work being done on a new MIME based remailer
standard that would allow this to happen. At this time, the big problem
seems to be keeping the message size constant between hops.

See the remailer-operators list for the current discussion.
