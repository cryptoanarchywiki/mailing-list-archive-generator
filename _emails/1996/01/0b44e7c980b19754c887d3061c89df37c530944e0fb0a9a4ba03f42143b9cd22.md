Try this scenario.  Bomb in cell phone's trigger is activated by a tone,
say the DTMF tones for the numbers 8 and 6.

Assassin calls phone number, and performs the following authentication protocol:

"Hi, this is J.Random Assassin.  May I speak to Mr. Intended Victim Please?"
"Speaking."
"Message for youuuuuuuuuuu...." Beep  Boop

BOOM!!!
