There are nym keys i have signed before.  They are usually for nyms of
friends and they are usually signed with another nym key.  Kind of a
fictional web of trust...

I normally only sign keys for people I have met and trust to be the
individual with the key claimed.  "True names" and other legal fictions do
not interest me as much as the individuals involved.
