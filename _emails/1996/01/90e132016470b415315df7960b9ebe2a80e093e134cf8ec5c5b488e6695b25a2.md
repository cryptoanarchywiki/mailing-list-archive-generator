This is the file used by admincfg.exe (on WFW3.11 disk 8). This file
contains "security" settings, such as whether or not to cache passwords
on disk (*.PWL files). 

There is no feature in WFW to prevent use of one copy on multiple
machines on a lan.

In terms of security, yes, the whole of Windows Networking is a bad joke.

(An interesting aside, it is possible to get a WfW "security" error
on start-up by having subst drives - weird, eh?)
