In general, the doctrine of estoppel is not applied against
governmental agencies.  To the extent that an agency is purportedly
making decisions as to what the law is, it may or may not be bound by
its earlier decisions, but it usually won't be.  And it is not bound
by its factual determinations.

That would stand up in court and in any case the statute that is the
basis for the ITAR says that the determination that
something--including fingernail clippers--is on the Munitions Lists is
not reviewable by the courts.  (And a court held before that provision
was passed that the question of whether commercial television
descramblers were properly on the munitions list, as cryptographic
devices, was a political question that could not be reviewed by the
court.  And that was, as I recall, a criminal case.)

I am convinced that most, if not all, the restrictions in the ITAR on
disclosing cryptographic software will be struck down by the courts as
being unconstitutional under the first amendment, but it will not be
an easy process.  There are all sorts of constitutional provisions
that are violated every day and though some of these violations will
be overturned by courts, if and only if someone like Phil Karn
challenges them in court, but the wheels of the law grind slowly.
