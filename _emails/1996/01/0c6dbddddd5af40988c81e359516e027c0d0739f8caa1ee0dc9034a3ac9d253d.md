|Hmm. Actually, what do Java dialog prompts look like? Is there any
|indication that they come from Java, or can they be made to look like any
|dialog from any program, or the OS itself? I suppose this is
|implementation-dependent. 
|
|One "neat" trick would be an applet that sleeps for several minutes and 
|then suddenly pops up asking for your system password, or something. 
|A heck of a lot of people fell for something much more primitive at AOL.

All graphical UI elements spawed by an applet, which are the only ones
that can get user events, are clearly marked as "untrusted applet
window"s.

So unless you type your password in a pop-up marked "untrusted applet
window", you should be fine. And if you do, you arguably deserve
whatever happens to you....
