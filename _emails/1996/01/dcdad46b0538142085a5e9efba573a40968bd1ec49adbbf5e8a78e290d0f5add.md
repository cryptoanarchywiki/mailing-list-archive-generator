I agree.
PGP should be as generic as possible; making it "know" about RFC822
and mailers makes it less generic.

Your PGP-aware mail agent should add a line to the text to be
encrypted, consisting of a random number (hopefully very unguessable
and fairly random) and an RFC822 header:

X-PGP-nonce: b1de70694f5f0824f89cb3f09aece01d

and replicate that in the RFC822 envelope.
Put just the nonce value and not the header in the block to be
encrypted if you're concerned about assisting a known-plaintext attack.

The nonce can't be extracted from the PGP ciphertext unless the attacker
has the ability to crack PGP, in which case merely re-directing
PGP encrypted messages to different recipients is beneath them. :-)
It is small and is easily verified by the human looking at the message.
PGP, or more accurately the MUA, won't need to check it (although
that would be fairly easy to do).

But like Derek says, PGP shouldn't do it, the MUA should.
