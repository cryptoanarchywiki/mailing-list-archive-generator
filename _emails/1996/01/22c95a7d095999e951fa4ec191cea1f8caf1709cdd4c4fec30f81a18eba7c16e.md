This could lead to problems. I'm not sure what the European Community reaction 
to US attempts to export its legal system will be. 

The problem is that the Lotus Notes scheme changes the previous deal. Before the 
European governments benefited from the US export control laws because they had 
wiretap abilities. Now they are denied wiretap capabilities and have the US able 
to snoop on all their traffic.

Could find yourselves in the middle of a nasty battle...
