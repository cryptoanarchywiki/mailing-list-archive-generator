I disagree.  I haven't met a system that couldn't somehow be gotten around.
The creativity of hackers is succeeded only by their motivation and ability 
to put many hours into trying to solve a problem.  Including the word
"probably" 
was deliberate.  Kerberos was also thought to be secure - 'til it was
compromised.  Software isn't bug-free & design or security methodologies
can't provide 100% 
coverage.  Hackers take advantage of this and inherent weaknesses in design
flaws.

Answer is the same as the above paragraph.  I try not to use the word "can't"
or "won't" when possible.  Granted "probably" sounds wishy-washy, but it is 
frequently accurate.

I disagree here also.  Systems by themselves are fairly useless.  Their
power (and main vulnerability) comes from their ability to network with 
other systems.  A system connected to a network is vulnerable.  The fact
that a corporate firewall protects the system from the Internet in no way 
decreases the vulnerability of that system (and other systems) from *internal*
attacks which can be as devastating as an Internet attack.

Including firewall capabilities as part of the Operating System's network
applications would help the system protect itself from abuses from the 
Internet - as well as from internal.

In the current context yes.  However, a firewall is only solving one 
part of the problem.  Just as Information Security must be integrated
into every layer of a company (from users->system managers->managers->
executives), it must also be incorporated into each part in a network
(systems, LANs, external connections).
