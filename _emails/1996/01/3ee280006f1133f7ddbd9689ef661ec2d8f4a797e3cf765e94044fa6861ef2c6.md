I doubt that they'd be interested, but if they are, Jon Lebkowsky of
EFF-Austin hosts Electronic Frontiers, a HotWired online discussion
forum, every Thursday night at 10 pm. The subject would fit in nicely
with his discussions; this week he had Steve Jackson, of Steve Jackson
Games.

I'm sure we could interest him in this.
