Well, this could be away for compuserve to cover it's rear in a realy 
slick fashion. If they chose to do it this way.

Most CIS subscribers use their proprietary interface, which puts a 
GUI front end over what is going on with them modem, what they amount 
to are scripts. 

Anyways, CIS could add a script that would check the NUH identifier, 
if it is in Germany, it goes to one newsfeed, if it's outside of 
Germany, it would go to another newsfeed.  They could even market the 
service here in the US to those who like censorship.

What could be "Accidentaly" leaked is a different version of the same 
file, that would not contain the check.

That way, Compuserve could claime that the offending parties tampered 
with the software, and they can not be help responsible for the 
tampering.

I highly doubt that Compuserve would go for such a resolution, but 
it's worth throwing into the mix
