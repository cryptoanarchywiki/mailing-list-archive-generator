Jerusalem, (Reuter) - The head of Israel's Shin Bet
resigned Monday just three days after the killing of a
wanted Palestinian bombmaker recovered some of the damage
the secret service suffered from the assassination of
Yitzhak Rabin.

The man, identified by his initial "kaf," remains in
office until a successor is appointed, Israel Radio said.
His predecessor, Yaacov Peri, is now president of one of
Israel's two cellular telephone networks.

Jerusalem (AP) -- The booby-trapped cellular phone that
killed an Islamic militant was delivered by a longtime
informer for Israel who was paid $1 million for helping,
media reports said Monday. 

A fugitive for three years, Ayyash was hiding in the home
of Osama Hamad, his friend from college days.  Hamad said
he warned Ayyash in the summer that his uncle, Kamal
Hamad, may be an informer for Israel.  

Hamad said his uncle gave him a cellular phone so he
could be found easily.  

A day before Ayyash was killed, his uncle asked for the 
cellular phone, took it and returned it later, requesting
that it be kept on at all times, Hamad said.  

Israel's security services apparently deceived Kamal
Hamad, telling him they had planted a bug in the phone,
rather than explosives, the radio said.  

Media reports said that the explosion was set off by
remote control when Ayyash answered a call to him. It is
not known how the identity of Ayyash was ascertained.
