Note that it is slightly easier to break this encryption than the 128 bit 
encryption with 68 bits sent in the clear used by Netscape.  

I think in general that any steps taken to reduce the amount of information 
avaliable. I'm happier if only the US government has access to the extra 28 bits 
of privacy than if everyone does. That is not to say that I am happy.

This is better than the government proposal for GAK which would have very easy 
access to the message content. 40 bits of privacy means that they do at least 
need to do some work. I would prefer it to be 48 at the very least.
