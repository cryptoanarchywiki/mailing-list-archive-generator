   1-2-96. WaPo:

   "Undercover on the Dark Side of Cyberspace. On-Line FBI
   Agents Troll for Those Who Prey on Children."

      The FBI unit now has more than $1 million worth of
      equipment, including high-speed modems and large data
      storage devices. In cases where suspects' computers have
      been seized, the agents have run up against
      password-protected and encrypted files, which sometimes
      have taken FBI technicians hundreds of hours to decode.


   1-2-96. FiTi:

   "Pobox and the magic cookie."

      Which company will have the greatest effect on the
      development of the Internet this year? My answer is
      neither Microsoft nor Netscape. It is a tiny new company
      called Pobox.com. Its product consists of a simple
      forwarding service that is an electronic equivalent of
      a post office box. This service allows people to give
      out an e-mail address that is independent of where they
      work or where they choose to buy Internet access.
