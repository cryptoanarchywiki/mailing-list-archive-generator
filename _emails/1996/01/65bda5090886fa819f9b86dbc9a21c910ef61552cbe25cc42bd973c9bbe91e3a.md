actually, i was speaking pretty much off the top of my head. it's
been a while since i registered it, but all i basically had to tell
the server the first time i used it was the s/n. and yes, i think it
would be Pretty Damn Stupid to have the s/n have anything to do with
the actual seed or pin.

VM> (The integrity of the product -- the unpredictability of the
VM> token-code PRN series, and the secrecy of a specific token's seed or
VM> key -- rightly depends cryptographic strength of the hash, not the
VM> secrecy of the algorithm.)  Getting a token-specific secret key would

one would certainly hope so. <g> personally, i like the card. it
offers pretty good security and thus gives me remote access to
systems my employer would otherwise laugh in my face for access to
(and did, more than once before we got these things). its main
weakness would be a black bag job where someone gains physical
posession. at that point, all bets on its securty are off for obvious
reasons. luckily, because of the nature of the device, i can simply
report it as stolen and it quickly becomes a rather worthless piece
of silicon.
