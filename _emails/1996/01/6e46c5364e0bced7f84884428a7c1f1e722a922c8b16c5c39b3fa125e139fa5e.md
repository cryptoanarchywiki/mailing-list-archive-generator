I'm quoting the whole thing since it's so old.  As I assume  you are aware, the reason I'm so interested in full payee/full payer anonymity for digital cash is that my idea, "Assassination Politics", requires it:  It is necessary to be able to reward a completely unknown person by a completely unknown person, in such a way that nobody can rat out the other person.  Even the presence of an intermediary (trusted) organization would be unnecessary if it were possible to GUARANTEE the offer of payment to the payee.  

As the idea is currently structured, the central organization collects the money, reports the donations, and makes the (continuing) publicized offer.  It publicizes enough information to prove to the average citizen that it is dealing fairly with all concerned.

Obviously, communication with the donors/guessors must be minimized/secured also, in such a way as to make detection of these people extremely difficult and ideally impossible.
