I tried 'em both and found them dog slow and unreliable, like most other
things based on AppleEvents. True command-line piping and DDE work in
UNIX/DOS/Windows, but there's none of that on the Mac. What I've done is
ResEdit key combinations into my software to do wordwrap, then I cut text,
switch to the PGP window, sign or encrypt the clipboard, switch back to
the mail/news window, and paste. MacPGP's "dialog shortcuts" make this
mostly painless. We don't need no steenking automation. 

Of course this doesn't work for attaching files, but I do that
sufficiently rarely that the minor pain of handling that case manually is
outweighed by the interest of minimizing the gunk in RAM and on the menu
bar.
