GERMAN PROSECUTORS TARGET INTERNET RACIAL HATRED
The Mannheim, Germany, prosecutor's office has launched an investigation of
CompuServe and Deutsche Telekom's T-Online service for inciting racial
hatred, a crime in Germany.  At issue is online access to a Web site run by
a neo-Nazi extremist in Canada who uses the Internet to distribute
anti-Semitic propaganda.  The legal reasoning, according to a prosecutor's
office spokesman, is that "because it's available over the Internet, it also
can be called up in Germany.  Then the scene of the crime is all Germany."
Although the investigation is now limited to CompuServe and T-Online, there
are also several hundred small companies that provide Internet access in
Germany. (Wall Street Journal 26 Jan 96 B2)
