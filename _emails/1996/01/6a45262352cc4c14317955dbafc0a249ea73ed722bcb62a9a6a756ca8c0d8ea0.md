No doubt in my mind that will happen within the next few years. Remember
from past posts that remailers already are technically illegal in a few
states, though the legislators probably didn't think of remailers, when
they wrote the laws. A law making remailer operators responsible for their
traffic will pass by a margin customary for similar bills in the past
(>90%).

Remailers in the US and most of Western Europe will be outlawed or shut
down on their own once a few of their owners are held liable for some Four
Horsemen traffic flowing through. It is precisely because remailers, and by
extension future encrypted TCP redirectors, are a much greater danger to
the statist than 128 bit Netscape will ever be.

   PGP encrypted mail preferred.
