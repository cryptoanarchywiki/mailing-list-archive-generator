No, it's to allow selective blocking of material that
a government-approved panel has described as deserving
blocking for children.  It's rabidly unnecessary,
and also too simplistic to be really useful.  For instance,
it's unlikely to block "COPS" and "The War In Bosnia"
under any available settings, and "Speeches of President Exon" 
will probably be required viewing because there isn't a "no lies"
setting.  Selective blocking, using VCRplus codes or some similar
technology, would be far more useful, support multiple rating
services, and give your VCR something to do other than flash 12:00.

Yup.  However, _you_ won't be the one doing the description...
