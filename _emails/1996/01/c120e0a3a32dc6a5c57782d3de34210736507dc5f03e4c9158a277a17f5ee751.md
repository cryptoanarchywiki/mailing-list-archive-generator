My grandfather was drafted towards the end of world war ii. he was a doctor and was among the first medical teams to land at anzio. his hospital was the first to arrive at auswitz <sp?>. When asked how that affected him, my grandmother said "After he returned from the war there was no joy left in him." 

I do not doubt the existance of prison camps in the third reich. Whether the stories have been exaggerated is another question. Besides in this day and age where Isreal is a nuclear arsenal run by nutty rightwing warlords who in their right mind would dare belittle their tragedies.

Rewriting history is a powerful tool, whether it be the history of the death of Hendrix, the death of Kennedy, the logging of the pacific northwest or of ethnic cleansing.

The only way to combat the powerful who would seek to rewrite history is to create an authenticatable system for document storage. Text books have long been regarded as the predominant model yet, pick up any high school history book and marvel at the differences from say Zinn's "The People's History of the United States". What is needed is more though. A system whereby one can trace the source of the information to the actual time and place of an event as well as authenticating identity.
