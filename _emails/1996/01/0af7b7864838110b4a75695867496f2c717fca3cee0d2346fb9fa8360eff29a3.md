My point is not that all retail clerks are bandits.  Most are   
trustworthy, but surely any long time CC user has given their card to   
someone who would rip them off if they thought they could get away with   
it.  My point is that CC #'s are not national security secrets, they are   
disclosed to potential adversaries regularly.

The point is FV's post relies on a frightening and false premise - that   
the users are exposed to one or more financial risks by FV's keyboard   
sniffer threat.
