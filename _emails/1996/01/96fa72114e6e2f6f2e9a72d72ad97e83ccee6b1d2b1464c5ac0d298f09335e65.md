[...commentary on labeling deleted...]

The problem is that labeling which begins as voluntary often has other 
consequences... for example, the voluntary labeling in the music 
industry. Although it's voluntary labeling, one state (Washington, I 
believe) at one point nearly passed (or possibly did pass - I can't 
remember) legislation making it illegal to sell labeled albums to minors.

The label itself, of course, was still voluntary.

I'm not opposed to *truly* and *permanantly* voluntary labeling; I'm just 
afraid of such labeling becoming permanant and mandatory...
