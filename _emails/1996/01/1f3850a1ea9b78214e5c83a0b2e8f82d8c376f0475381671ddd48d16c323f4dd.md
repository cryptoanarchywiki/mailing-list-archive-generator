Sorry, but the "German government" did not threaten to do anything at all.
A (conservative-ish) prosecutor started an _investigation_, which
in his eyes was nothing more than executing the law (and sorry, that's
what the guy is paid for).

If the German government did something wrong, it was accepting a law
for the protection of minors (Jugendschutzgesetz), which says that
minors should not be allowed to have access to booze, dope and porno.

Please tell me such laws do not exist in your country...

If anything, this whole bussiness will be one step in the correct
direction:
- Either some modus operandum is found which makes it clear for everybody
  how to offer pornographic material and comply with the law at the
  same time (cf. the First Virtual account ID's you have to enter at
  all those sites pointing to www.infohaus.com - in the US, this modus
  operandum seems to be ``proof of having a credit card'');
- Or the German Government learns about the lack of frontiers on the Net, 
  and gives up (which is highly improbable).
I think the first point is most realistic (especially when considering that
German prosecutors don't have the option of not prosecuting when they hear
about a felony, like for example Dutch prosecutors). Given my experience
with the German government, however, it will take some time for them to
realize that they need a set of rules in this area.
