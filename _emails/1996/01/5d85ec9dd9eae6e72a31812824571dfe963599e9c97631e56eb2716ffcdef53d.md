And The Economist wisely puts notices warning readers to use there own
discretion on such services.  Great mag, it gave some of the best and 
sanest articles on the internet ever printed in the "popular press".

Beside there rather ambigous value as "asset protection" and "tax
sheltering", the main reason people use offshore banking is to gain better
interest rates.

In Thailand, the Bangkok International Banking Facility offers interest
rates on deposits that are several percentages higher than normal banks. 
The banks of the facility work under a different set of banking laws from
normal banks.  Also, the interest rate on loans also tends to be lower. 
I'm not sure whether international funds are subject to local (thai) or
international (us) tort judgements though, but many of the banks in the
BiBF advertise to offer high privacy and security.
