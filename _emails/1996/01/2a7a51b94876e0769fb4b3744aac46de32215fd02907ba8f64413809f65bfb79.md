I'm ready.  I'm willing to put in some bucks.
We need a lawyer, a [virtual] center.
I think the easiest part to get would be a financial accounting
(partial I bet).  I'm sure the DOJ has a (cya) policy of never 
identifing goons of a failed persecution.

It has been suggested to me that individual law suits against the
the low level people that CAN be identified might be an approach.
Sue for violation of constitutional rights.
The depositions would work like a grand jury invrestigation.
"Well, Agent Smith, if you were just following orders
WHO gave them to you?"  Sue your way up the line.
Lotsa Ebucks :-(
