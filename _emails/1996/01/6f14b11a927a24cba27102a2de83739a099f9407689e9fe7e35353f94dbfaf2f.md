I said "modern" country.  Even so, Russia and the rest are much more market
dominated than they used to be.  Transition will not be easy but I doubt if
they'll go back.  As for an eternity of slavery being superior to too

Anglo-Saxon values" is pretty powerful.

That would require outlawry of crypto over the backbone and some way of
convincing the backbone to run government approved code.  Quite a bit of
resistance would ensue.  Have the Feds ever successfully mandated that large
numbers of people run government code?
