	if you get the usual 150+ msg/day I do, you break it up into
    folders, set the reader to proceed sequentially through the folders,
    in an order defined in .pinerc. I have 30 folders current.

	when a particular person becomes annoying:

	    # net assholes 

	    :0 HB 
	    * ( Fred.*Cohen|fc@all.net|vznuri|kevin.dirks )
	    assholes

    takes care of the problem nicely.  

	If you get bored with a newsletter, etc. I move its 
    folder address in procmail to "bigsleep" and every so 
    often I try to cancel the group.

	Now, if I wish to really get hostile, I have a little 
    program which returns the message showing "bounce@..." in 
    the From:, Reply-To:, and Sent-By: fields. At the top of the 
    body it 'shouts' the sender is objectionable and the mail
    returned.  It does keep a log of who it bounced and if it
    one of the no-return types, it 'learns' from another list 
    to use /dev/null.  

	There is no limit to how far you can go, including mail 
    bombing. spoofing the top line From is hard to do for lack 
    of insecure mailers, but it can be done by other means. The
    only spammer I have had trouble discouraging is nashville.net.
    But I really do not believe in mail bombing as it hurts too
    many bystanders --cheap to generate, but expensive to clean
    up after.

	So, indulge in procmail(), premail(), formail(), and 
    older versions of smail() and join the fun.
