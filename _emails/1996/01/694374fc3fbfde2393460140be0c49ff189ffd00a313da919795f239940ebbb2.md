I have noticed that the software they are using is VERY picky about he
formatting of the request and how it is encoded in PGP.  To get it to work,
I had to use the EXACT instructions posted to get it to subscribe.

The PGPMajordomo software is a great idea, but in practice it has not been
that fun to use.  The biggest problem has been that the mail client I use
does not do PGP that well.  Hopefully the state of E-Mail support for PGP
will change.

Another project to add to the list...

        `finger -l alano@teleport.com` for PGP 2.6.2 key 
                http://www.teleport.com/~alano/ 
         Is the operating system half NT or half full?
