On Jan 04, 1996 08:28:11, 'liberty@gate.net (Jim Ray)' wrote a critique of
my post to the list concerning what turned out to be a private message to
me. 
 
J. Ray's points made in his critique are on-target and correct. 
 
My actions were not. 
 
I apologize to the people on the list for eating up their bandwidth in a
public response to a private e-message. 
 
I especially apologize to J.Ray for whatever inconvience I may have caused
him.
