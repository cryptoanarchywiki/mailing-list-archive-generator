I have heard that their are alpha releases currentky geing worked on at
quest/qualcomm. But i would have to say before they come out your best bet
to pgp and eudora is either pidaho or just use it in dos. pidaho is a great
front end. A lot better than any others out their.

 I have also heard that ViaCrypt is a good alternative. But I am not sure.
Has anyone else out there heard anything good/bad about ViaCrypt?
