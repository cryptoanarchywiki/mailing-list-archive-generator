Geez, guys, they didn't even do that.

Some rag said that Nazis used PGP.

Some anonymous guy forwarded, without substantive comment, a report of the
above. 

The report is true, to a point. Nazis use PGP. So do child pornographers,
anti-Nazis, rapists, women who have been raped and don't care for the
world to know, major US and international corporations, and the US
Military (most of the computer security bulletins I see from .mil are
PGP-signed). 

I thought the report was totally bogus, and I took Mr. Anonymous's posting
to be a joke -- see, first those silly people who don't understand
anything are attacking the Internet because it's got these dirty pictures
on it, now they say there's Nazis using encryption on it. 

Was there nobody else who was able to look at that and laugh?

Sheesh.

"Wrong" is irrelevant, because it's unenforceable. Right, guys? Don't be 
such a girlie, Alex.

What we need is amoral deterrence at the most atomistic level, right? 
Heck, it's the only thing that we know works.
