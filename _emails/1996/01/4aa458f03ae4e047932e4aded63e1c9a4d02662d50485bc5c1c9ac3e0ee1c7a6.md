  Friend, 
 
 
  12 31 95 Associated Press reports: 
 
     Ah, the future ...
   
     At least part of what will happen in the coming year 
     seems clear.  Cyberspace will be regulated -- kicking 
     and screaming -- and the court battles over free speech 
     will begin.  "It's going to throw the Internet into a 
     state of uncertainty for several years," said [Bob] Smith 
     [of Interactive Services Association]. 
 
 
  You may recall the question I asked in an earlier message: 
 
     And when the State DECIDES...? 
 
 
  But that's all right... 
 
     Despite that, business growth on the net will begin to 
     catch up with the phenomenal increase in accounts. 

 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim 
 
 
 
  NOTE.  The newsstory's headline?  YEAR OF THE INTERNET: 
  What a tangled web we weave.  Its dateline?  (Dec 31, 1995 - 
  00:23 EST).  Accessed at?  Nando News (www.nando.net). 
  Online filename?  info306_3.html 
  
  That message?
