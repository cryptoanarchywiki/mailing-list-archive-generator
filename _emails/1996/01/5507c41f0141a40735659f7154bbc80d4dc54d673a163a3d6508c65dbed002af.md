But what if they *ask* you nicely to label your work?

  "If you think your message is offensive, violent, or racist,
   would you please consider labelling it?"

I don't think I'd mind.  In fact, *optional* labels would make me more likely
to post such material, because I'd have some confidence that it would only be
read by people who want to read it. (And they could even find it more
quickly!)

There's nothing inherently wrong with labelling information. When messages
here are labelled [NOISE], I know to avoid them. This sort of
meta-information is helpful and good.

The precedent is what's troubling. Someone will probably try to mandate the
labels...Someone will try to write a law that says "Anyone who posts what I
consider offensive without a label is guilty." This is what should be
fought...not labels.
