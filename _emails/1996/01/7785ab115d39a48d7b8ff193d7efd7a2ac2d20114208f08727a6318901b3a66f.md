Hi,

  First question:  Is this the appropriate place to go with this kind of 
question.  If not, I apologize.  Anyways here goes:  
 
  I'm trying to build PGP, the MIT version under windows NT using 
Microsoft C++ version 4.0.  The program builds after a few modifications 
to the makefile but cannot generate a RSA key.  Everytime, I type pgp 
-kg and answer the required questions, pgp attempts to generate some 
primes and apparently fails.  Anyone have a clue as to what the problem 
may be???

  I know there is an executable of PGP for NT already made, I've used 
it.  So I at least know it's possible to build on NT.  Anyone else 
attempt a port to NT???

Thanks ahead of time,

Max
