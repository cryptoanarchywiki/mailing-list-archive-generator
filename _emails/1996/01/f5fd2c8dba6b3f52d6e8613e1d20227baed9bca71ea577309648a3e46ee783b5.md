I think that there is a MAJOR difference between the two types of
Marketing. The Superbowl adds are not designed with the intent to imply
that what is being shown is Reality (how many viewers would think that what
was being shown was a REAL [as opposed to symbolic] effect of the product?)
while the FV is intended to play on the technical ignorance of the
reader/audience and give a false [or at least slanted] view of reality.
