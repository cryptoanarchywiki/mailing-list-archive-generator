[Some people will object to this thread, and rightly so.  This is very off
topic.  I understand it is off topic.  But it needs to be said... If you
don't want to read this, hit 'n' or equivalent now. I also request that
responses to this be made in private e-mail and not to the entire list.]

the Democracy now list and avoided the urge to add the psychoceramics list.]

Jim, I used to take your postings at least semi-serious.  I ignored the ad
hominem as much as I could and tried to concentrate on the validity of the
arguments.  I had difficulty with many of your ideas, but I have that
problem with many people so it was not a big deal...

Then I met you at the Portland Cypherpunks meeting. You blew whatever
credibility that you had with me at that time.

At that meeting you made claims that were fantastic and beyond belief.  You
gave no evidence to support those claims, just relying on some sort of
future "proof".  (Sorry, but the burden of proof in these sort of cases lies
on the claimant, not the rest of the audience.) Assassination politics is
immensely credible compared to your plan to disable electronic equipment.
(And that is saying alot.)

Assassination politics suffers from a number of problems.  The biggest being
its difficulty in being implemented.  Such a system would suffer from
Federal agents posing as hit men, outright fraud, and attempts to destroy
the system from within and without.  I have seen nothing that makes me
believe it could ever be put into place.  I have yet to see you address any
of the flaws without resulting to flames and rant.

Unfortunately, you would rather attack your critics than deal with the flaws
in your beliefs.

The following is an example...

There are reasons why an individual would do that.  Maybe they did not want
to create a nym just to respond to one message.  Maybe they thought that you
would recognize their other nyms. Maybe it is someone you know.  Whatever
the reason, it does not diminish their arguments.

You think very highly of your arguments, but have shown nothing that would
make me believe that you could actually do that without resorting to ad
hominem attacks.  In fact the poster brings up some interesting questions
which you totally ignore, due to your unwavering belief in your pet theory.
All you do is flame him, instead of dealing with the immense flaws in that
theory.

Not all anarchists believe in killing others.  Sorry, but there are as many
variety of anarchy as there are anarchists.  As for the results of
"Assassination Politics", you have yet to show that it would produce any
results whatsoever, or if it is even possible to implement.  In fact, I
cannot see a way that it can be put into place without everyone involved
being put in jail.

Yet you never explain why it is valid to use evil to fight evil.  It is this
lack of willingness to discuss the details of your beliefs that make people
unwilling to take your ideas seriously.

Or not participating...  Jim, if annoying people were a qualification for
murder, you would need to watch your back pretty damn carefully.  But it is
not a qualification yet...

You have yet to show, however, how your plan could ever be enacted.  If it
was possible to enact, you would probably be in jail for "conspiracy to
commit murder" or some similar charge.  Anyone who assisted in such a plan
would also risk such charges.  The feds are pretty ruthless in ferreting out
people who try an hire hitmen.  Especially from private citizens. the only
people who are able to hire hitmen and get away with it are the heavily
funded or the government themselves.  Setting up an organization to compete
with these groups will not be viewed favorably.

>For the record, I suspect some people who are total pacifists view the rest

This is not as easily defendable as self-defense.  If you were shooting the
politico yourself, then I might agree.  But you are not.  You are hiring
someone else to do your dirty work for you.  If you were actually helping
out in the slaughter, then i might have a bit more respect for your
argument.  As it is though, I find it about as toothless as those who eat
meat, but are too squeamish to go hunting themselves.

The digestibility of your plan has little relevance to its possible adoption...

Nope.  The poster is claiming that you are *TOO CLUELESS* to be an Agent
Provocateur.  You are missing the point.

I don't think you are any such thing.  I believe that you are convinced of
the rightness of your ideas and no amount of rational discourse will sway
you from that belief. Being a fanatic does not make you evil or an Agent
Provocateur.  It does make you less credible though...

You seem to miss the point that the poster was making, but no worry...

The above speaks for itself.  (I could say that this is one of the looniest
things I have read in a while, but I do take the Psychoceramics list...  It
is pretty high up there.)   It is definitely hard core crankdom of the
purest form.

If you were a threat to the Government, even a small one, you would have
been picked up and put away.  You seem to forget that this is an open
mailing list.  Many of the people who read this list are Government
employees.  (I am willing to bet that a sizable percentage work in some
variety of law enforcement.)  They know what you believe and what you are
agitating for.  But you are not a threat because you are not credible.  No
one is going to adopt your ideas because every time you open your mouth, you
make yourself look like a loon.  Not only do you make yourself look like a
loon, but every organization and group you associate with looks bad.

If you really desire to make your views accepted, you need to look at how
you present yourself to others.  Willingness to analyze your own belief
structures and refine them is a first step. Ability to take criticism is a
second step.  Without that, your ideas will be taken as the views of an
unwavering fanatic.  You will not sway many people with fanaticism.

I think that you have little to nothing to say about being taken seriously.

If you continue to go off on pseudo-science rants at meetings at the drop of
a hat, no one will take you serious there as well...
