Absitively.

But government employees should only be held accountable for their actions
as government employees. If the situation warrants, go ahead and tap their
offices, break into their work computers, etc. But don't fuck with their 
personal lives.

Lots of people on this list have the power to carry out their own tyranny
over both individuals and groups. All it takes in today's fragile online
world is a little specialized knowledge. I don't think it's ethical to use
this power without serious thought. 

The line between government and non-government is increasingly blurry
anyway. Everybody gets something from the government, be it roads or an
education. Why should you be more suspicious of the guy getting paid
$10/hour to deliver your mail by the government than the private
businessman getting millions of dollars in government subsidies? 

I think we're fundamentally asking the wrong question. I only see relative
power. I'd estimate that Bill Gates is more powerful than Fidel Castro in
many respects. He's certainly a lot more powerful than your average postal
clerk.
