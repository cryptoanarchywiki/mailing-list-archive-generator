Lucky usually defines the pessimistic extreme of cypherpunk views of the
future (with Duncan at the other end). I tend to agree with Lucky's side, but
then I _am_ an inveterate cynic. But to be annoyingly cute about it,
inveterate != invertebrate. I don't envision a rosy scenario, but I'm not
giving up.

Well, let's talk about it openly! I'm not terribly interested in answers of 
the form "God moves in mysterious ways" or "If you knew what I knew, you'd
support the government's proposal to do this", although most of the world
seems to find such answers enthralling.

- From where I sit, Lucky seems to have been quite active on the front lines,
in spite (or perhaps because) of his rhetoric.
