	     EXPERTS PREDICT END OF SECURE COMMUNICATIONS


(East Bumbleton, Arkansaw) Experts from Really Neat Idea Labs have
predicted the end of secure communications on the internet. The firm
today announced that anyone watching another person enter a credit
card on a computer could possibly get that person's credit card
number. A spokesperson for RNI Labs said, "Wow man! This is like an
incredible discovery, man. If you can like see someone entering their
card number then you can like look at what keys they push and like get
their number and like charge stuff to them. There is like no hardware
or software on earth that can like prevent it." The spokesperson went
on to say that the reprocussions of their discovery could lead to
world-wide economic chaos, a rebirth of the third reich, and the 27th
coming of Jesus Christ.

In a related story, retired talk-show host Johnny Carson is under
federal investigation. An anonymous tipster told authorities that
Mr. Carson has been using his "Amazing Karmack" hat to guess the
credit card numbers of newly mailed cards. Mr. Carson could not be
reached for comment.
