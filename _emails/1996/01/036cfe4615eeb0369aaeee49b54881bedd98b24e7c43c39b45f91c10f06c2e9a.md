Greetings All,

I have been lurking as a newbie on the cypherpunks mailing list for 'bout one month.  Have ordered Koblitz book on Number Theory and Applied Cryptography.  As I slowly (and probably painfully) learn some number theory, I would like to start coding, particularly as it would related to encrypting and decrypting stuff.  I ask the community's input as to whether I should use visual basic or visual C++ ??? I am using a windoze95 platform.

Any comments would be welcome.. thanks
