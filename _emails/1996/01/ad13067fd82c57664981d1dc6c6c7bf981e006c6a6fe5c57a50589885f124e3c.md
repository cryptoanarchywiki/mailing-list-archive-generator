[Stuff]

Where is this opus of yours on the new political order? On Dejanews, I 
found only people ridiculing you. Searching the Web for Jim Bell, I found 
only an environmentalist with entirely different delusions of grandeur.
Searching for Klaatu, I found only a bad science fiction movie. And you 
know that the older cypherpunk archives aren't so well maintained.

Could you please post a URL? I really don't think you need to send the
whole thing to the list again, but such an important innovation in
political theory should certainly be shared with the world. I mean, after 
years on FidoNet, talking to *a dozen* people who disagree with you, you 
must have a lot to contribute.

If you don't have a Web or FTP server of your own, I'd be happy to host
it, without comment, and with your PGP signature of course so that no
meanies can mess with your prose. I could even put it on a server with no 
obvious ties to me.

Surely you would like people to know the way Jim Bell thinks.

Let me know...
