We run an online mall.  We had been planning eventually to offer the
store owners the option of taking fv payment as well as credit 
card numbers.

After reading your recent post to cypherpunks, which I would say is
the most bogus post ever made on this bogus subject, we are 
determined *not* to use fv payment systems if we can possibly 
avoid it.

That post was news to no one.  The kind of attack you "discovered"
has been known about for years, and is just not a serious threat.
Your post was nothing but a calculated attempt to frighten end
users, and get publicity for fv.  

A company capable of doing such irresponsible things is not one 
that we would trust with users' money.
