San Diego Area CPUNKS symposium  ....

"Remailers & Cypherpunk".

Time : 6:30 - 8:30

SORRY for the late notice.  I spaced the announcement.  Hope you can join us.

Thursday, January 25, 1996

   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at this special
session lead by our very own Lance Cottrell.  Get the latest update of Lance
Cottrell's anonymous e-mail server, "mixmaster", exchange keys, and discuss
other topical subjects.  If you are in to what's happening on the list,
encryption, privacy, this is the place to be.

   The group may retire somewhere else after 8:30 to continue with other CP
related issues, so join us.

   Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint and two forms of
identification.  If you can figure out how to get it on the back of a
business card, that would be cool.  

   Drop me a note if you plan to attend.


See you there!
