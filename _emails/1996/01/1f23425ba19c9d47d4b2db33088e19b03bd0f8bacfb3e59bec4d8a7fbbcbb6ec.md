Like many born after the Second World War, I took it as a fact that the
so-called Holocaust actually happened. I saw pictures of death camps,
interviews with survivors, etc.

But if it really happened, why are so many countries trying to suppress the
evidence that it was all just a CIA-Mossad plot? It seems more likely that
the pictures were faked, or were pictures taken of dying Germans in Russian
POW camps on the Eastern Front.

If They are trying to suppress discussion, maybe there's something to their
ideas.

If the Germans are suppressing attempts to get at the truth, I suspect the
stories are true that the Holocaust was part of Truman's "Big Lie."

[Note: I present this as a line of thinking that is actually often the
result of suppression of views. "If They are suppressing it, maybe there's
some truth to it." Note also that the views of Zundel and other Holocaust
Deniers are not causally related to the deaths of millions of Jews,
gypsies, and others in WW II. The damage, if any, is in the "hurt feelings"
and "insults" felt by survivors and their relatives. The other danger often
cited, that Zundel will recruit a Fourth Reich or somesuch, is no more
likely than that Jerry Falwell will recruit a New Crusade, or that J.
Random Ranter will do the same. In a free and open society, we let people
believe in "wrong ideas" (witness Christianity, Islam, Scientology,
Judaism, and a thousand other cults).]
