  Friend, 
 
 
  01 07 96 the business news agency Bloomberg reports: 
 
    Netscape Communications Corp. said it will release in two 
    weeks a new version of its popular browsing software, de- 
    signed to keep the Internet software company ahead of rival 
    Microsoft Corp. 
                              ... 
 
    The [new] browser can use programs that are stored on cen- 
    tral computers on the Internet, making a personal computer's 
    operating system less important. 
 
 
  And thereby making GOVERNMENT LOGIC more important? 
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim 
 
 
 
 
  NOTE: The newsstory's headline?  NETSCAPE WILL RELEASE AN 
  UPDATED INTERNET BROWSER IN TWO WEEKS.  Its dateline? 
  MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (Jan 7, 1996 4:16 p.m. EST).  Its 
  Nando News online filename?  biz7_1087.html
