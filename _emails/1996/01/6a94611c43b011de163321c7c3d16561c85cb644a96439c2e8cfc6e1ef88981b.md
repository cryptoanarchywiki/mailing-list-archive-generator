This would be killing a mosquito with a flyswatter. Besides, the
employees of a financial institution may be in no position to
accurately state its financial situation, even if they are in
little cubicles with guns to their heads.

A somewhat more civilized method is used by my broker, who gets
audited on a regular schedule by one of the major accounting
firms.  The accounting firm puts an insert into every statement
periodically, with an envelope addressed to the accounting firm,
asking the customer to carefully examine the enclosed statement
and to contact them if it is not entirely accurate.

I would trust the typical customer to mail back a form to an
outside auditor far more than I would trust him to examine a hash
tree, check his own entry, check the neighborhood of his own
entry for cryptographic integrity, and sound an alarm.

To be perfectly candid, I would not even want the task of
explaining to the typical banking customer what a hash tree was.

The outside auditor can of course be spoofed by giving him access
only to some subset of customer accounts.  The hash tree can be
spoofed by not telling a subset of customers of its existance.

All things considered, I think I would prefer the auditor.
