Maybe I don't understand your point, but... 

1.  Individual private citizens acting on their own deserve privacy and
anonymity.
2.  Government employees receiving paychecks based on tax dollars stolen
from members of the public do not.
3.  Individuals not harming others deserve privacy and anonymity.
4.  Government employees threatening citizens with large fines and jail
time, for doing what we consider right and good, do not.

Get the picture?
