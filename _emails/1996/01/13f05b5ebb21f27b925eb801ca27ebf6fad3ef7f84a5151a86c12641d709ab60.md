Why shouldn't they?

What does a hotel do, if not act as a local communication
concentrator for guests? What about multi-company PBX
installations? Most PBX's have for years supported the
facility to handle entirely separate groups of trunks, often
called "tenants." This facility is used in shared-receptionist,
shared-PBX scenarios. Each incoming trunk call identifies the
"tenant" or company to which the call is addressed, so the
receptionist may answer appropriately. I even seem to vaguely
remember hearing of apartments or co-ops that use a PBX
instead of having direct subscriber lines to each apartment. 

Aggregation of communication facilities within the boundaries
of public rights of way seems to be a long-standing practice,
at least in the voice field. Voice and data are increasingly
indistinguishable, the latest move in that direction being the
practice of supporting a PBX with all-ISDN trunks.

I have to think there is something in the way you have gone
about it that leaves you with a defect in the kinds of
recourse any of the above examples would have and would not 
hesitate to use.

Maybe you should organize the effort in some formal manner. 
Some states allow legal standing for unincorporated 
associations. Maybe a cooperative? Maybe (shudder) a 
corporation?

Far enough off the ground to make it interesting. 800 lbs
makes a satisfying crunch when it hits the ground. Maybe if
you poke around you can find a few dozen other groups in
similar situations, and make it far more expensive for the
telco to harrass you than to deliver service as it is supposed
to do.
