I was trying to explore possible ways to beat TA with less bandwidth, in the
context of transient (w.r.t. network address) anonymizers. I indicated doubt
about the possibility of any real gain, and as I think about it more I'm
not able to convince myself that there's any real value at all in that 
regard.
