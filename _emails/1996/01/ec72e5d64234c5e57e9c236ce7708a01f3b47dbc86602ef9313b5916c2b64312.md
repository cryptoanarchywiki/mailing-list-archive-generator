The oldest and most trustworthy way to crack crypto --
and a cryptologist -- is sex, regularly employed by
royalty and traitors, tyrants and anarchists, governments
and bandits, warfighters and jealous lovers, spouses and
businesses, and whatever other position/opposition
pleasures and betrays.

If you have a security system that does not protect
against it you're really fucked.

Just who is doing what to who in "Takedown" constitutes
its shameless Hollywoodian prurience, as it was in
Littman, Clancy, Vinge, Tolstoy, the Bible, the Koran,
the Kama Sutra, any indecent Exon-prohibition of your
dreams.

Shimomura, Markoff, Mitnick -- are the games of seductive
illusion they're playing so different from vaunted
cryptography of the ever-randy, coy/decoy Net?

Has nobody ever blurted their password in the throes of
passionate words?

Imagine Toad Hall and what was up in the hot tub.
