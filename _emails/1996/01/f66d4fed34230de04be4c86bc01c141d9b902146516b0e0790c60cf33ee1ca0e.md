Well, as bad as the lack of anonymity may be, NNTP server logs serve a very 
usefull purpose, ie finding and eliminating trolls and spammers.

Unfortunatly, I would have to go logs given the state of UseNet.

Why not just read from the open server, and post anonyomously using anonymous 
remailers and News-to-Mail Gateways?
