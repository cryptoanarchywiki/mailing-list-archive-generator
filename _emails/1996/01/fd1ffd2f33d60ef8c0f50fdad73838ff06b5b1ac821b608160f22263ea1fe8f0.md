If the processes are operating in encrypted accounts not under the control
of the machine owner it is hard to find the machine owner liable.  In
addition, the Feds can only afford a few prosecutions at $50-$100K each
(Brian, if you're listening what *does* the average Federal prosecution
cost?).  The cost of setting up servers is much lower than the cost of
busting them.
