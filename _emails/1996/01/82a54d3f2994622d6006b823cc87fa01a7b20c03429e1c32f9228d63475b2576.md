One way to kill the V-chip dead is to announce hacks to the V-chip box that
will do the _reverse_ of this: block commercials (advertisements, for any
non-American readers) but pass programs.

(Before anyone points out that such boxes have been built, based on volume
levels, spectral content, etc., sure. What I'm speculating about is a
subversive campaign to get the meme out there that the V-chip can be used
as a filter of commercials.)

Even if it is not done, fear of the possibility of this will kill the proposal.
