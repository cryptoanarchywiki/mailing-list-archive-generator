  I agree with what you are saying.  I very much want to see real competition
in the certificate issuing business.  We are in the process of developing
a set of criteria that CAs have to meet in order to be included in the
"default" list of CAs that our products support.  The criteria focus
on assuring support for our customers more than trying to specify a
particular policy.  The criteria will include things like required
minimum response times for customer problems, compliance with an
interoperability spec, publishing of policies, etc.  Some time in
the next few months these criteria will be made public, and that 
should allow for open competition.

  I would suggest that you wait until you see our published criteria before
you spend too much effort setting up such a service, so that you can
be sure to meet them.  We don't care how big a company you are, as long
as you agree to provide our customers with a reasonable level of support
and issue certs that are compatible with our products.
