From Shimomura's mail last January:

: The IP spoofing attack started at about 14:09:32 PST on 12/25/94.  The first
: probes were from toad.com (this info derived from packet logs):
: 
: 14:09:32 toad.com# finger -l @target
: 14:10:21 toad.com# finger -l @server
: 14:10:50 toad.com# finger -l root@server
: 14:11:07 toad.com# finger -l @x-terminal
: 14:11:38 toad.com# showmount -e x-terminal
: 14:11:49 toad.com# rpcinfo -p x-terminal
: 14:12:05 toad.com# finger -l root@x-terminal

Again, quoting Shimomura's mail:

: About six minutes later, we see a flurry of TCP SYNs (initial connection
: requests) from 130.92.6.97 to port 513 (login) on server...
: 130.92.6.97 appears to be a random (forged) unused address (one that will 
: not generate any response to packets sent to it)...

Given that this was a _spoofing_ attack, mayhaps the packets from toad.com 
were also forgeries. Anyone in the know?
