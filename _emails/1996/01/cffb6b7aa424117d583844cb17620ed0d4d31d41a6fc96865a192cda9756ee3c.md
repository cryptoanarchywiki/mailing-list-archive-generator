Certainly. There are a couple of ways, but all one needs is some sort of 
gateway to an e-cash, which is simply e-money without identification. The 
gateway could take the form of a human intermediary, with either services or 
physical goods being the medium of exchange, or simply an exchange server 
which takes a cut off the top, as happens in the street all the time in 
countries that have currency restrictions.

Question:

The existing underground economy uses the same money as the aboveground  
economy (i.e. paper money, for the most part).  Could a significant  
underground digital economy develop if the aboveground digital economy  
used only identified e-money?
