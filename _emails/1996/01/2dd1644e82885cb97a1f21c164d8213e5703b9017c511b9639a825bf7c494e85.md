Wouldn't this interoperate only with other systems which had a similar setup? I suspect
the Lotus wants the US-Domestic and the International versions to interoperate
transparently, including with  their older versions.

Kaufman describes the encryption setup of Notes in moderate detail on pages 448-454
of 'Network Security'. It's a typical mixed system, with a secret key encrypted under the
recipient's Public key (a short one or a long one, depending on the local of the 
recipient and/or sender).

I suspect that Lotus has not completely reworked it's security system for the 
international version, and that they are in fact doing a second public key operation on 
the 3 bytes of GAK'd data.

If they're nasty, they'll check on the receiving side as well, to ensure that the LEAF 
and/or the espionage-enabling key have not been patched in the sending 'International'
version.
