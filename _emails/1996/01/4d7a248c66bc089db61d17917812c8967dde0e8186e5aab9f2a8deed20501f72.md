Lots of content regulation in the US:

Libel, slander, indecency (radio and TV), obscenity, Federal Trade
Commission (advertizing controls), Food and Drug Administration (drug
'labeling' and info controls), booze and cigarette advertizing, EEOC
(controls on discriminatory advertizing), children's television
requirements, civil defense broadcast requirements, station identification
requirements, civil controls on advertizing foreign financial services (did
you know this was illegal?), civil liability for carrying 'hit man' ads,
etc.  I'd come up with more if I had more time.  I'll add more over the next
few days as I think of them.

Not to mention the numerous content controls in countries other than the US. 

The Nets will smash all of these content controls.
