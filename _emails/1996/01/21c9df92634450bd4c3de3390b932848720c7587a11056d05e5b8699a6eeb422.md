At least maybe I can avoid Perry's wrath for an off topic post :-).

I agree that firewalling every machine would be extreemly difficult with
Unix based systems (including MSDOS and MacOS) because so many usefull
hacker tools are available from root and everyone has access to root.  With
systems that provide better isolation, it becomes possible to dedicate the
network interface to the protection domain which is running the firewall
code.  You also need to divide up the administration so the direct user
does not break that isolation.

BTW, IBM's VM/370 (and successors) has good isolation and could probably
perform in this role.  Other systems such as KeyKOS
(http://www.webcom.com/~agorics/) and EROS (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eros)
certainly could.
