I tried this site http://anonymizer.cs.cmu.edu:8080/prog/snoop.pl
using Mosaic 2.7b2 and was told:

     Your computer is a X11;Linux 1.2.13 i486. 
     Your Internet browser is NCSA Mosaic. 
     You just visited the Anonymizer Home Page. 

With Arena it gave me:

     Your Internet browser is Arena/0.96s libwww/.

Lynx came up with even less:

     Your computer is a Unix box.
     Your Internet browser is Lynx.


I did manage to completely confuse it with:

This time it actually took a stab at the user name, and got it completely
wrong, although the hostname (netcom20.netcom.com) was correct.  I suspect
it used finger and took a wild guess.


The rest of the information is obvious from the User-Agent header, though I
find it unusual that the new Mosaic reports the cpu/os type:

 User-Agent:  NCSA_Mosaic/2.7b2 (X11;Linux 1.2.13 i486)  libwww/2.12 modified

Mosaic 2.4 reports only:

 User-Agent:  NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System/2.4 (L10N-2.4.0)  libwww/2.12 modified

Lynx reports:

 User-Agent:  Lynx/2.2  libwww/2.14

The statement "Your computer is a Unix box." seems to be just a likely
guess, but it could be wrong, because there is a version of lynx for MSDOS.


What suprises me is not the information this got, but what it *DIDN'T* get.
It never managed to figure out my username, despite the fact that netcom
runs identd, and all three web browsers give it my username when they opened
the FTP connection.  It only reported the hostname in one instance, and
seems to be ignoring the info from the ftp session.
This "snoop" script isn't getting half the information it could!
