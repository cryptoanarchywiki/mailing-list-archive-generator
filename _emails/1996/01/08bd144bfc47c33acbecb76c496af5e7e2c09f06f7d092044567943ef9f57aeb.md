Caller ID could tell them where you are calling from.  They can also use
their billing information and user profile information to decide where you
live and/or how old you are.  I wonder if any of these filters will keep
the German prosecutors off their necks, given that they can be bypassed.

I feel sorry for them given the situation they are in, and want to kick
their butts for just rolling over dead instead of fighting for free access.
