For what it's worth, you can use the mapping software at
<http://tiger.census.gov> to find your location fairly accurately; you may
need another map to locate yourself, since the streets are unlabeled. I
managed to figure out that I'm currently at latitude 37.3435 degrees,
longitude -121.8925 degrees. I think that's correct to within about 100
feet or so.
