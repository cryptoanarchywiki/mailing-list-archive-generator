A paraphase of Bill Gates in 1981:

"640K ought to be enough for anybody."

However, DRAM technology and use can't really be compared to the fundamental
mathematical problem posed by factoring prime composites. Stuffing more
gates on a chunk of silicon is just an engineering problem. Correct me
if I'm wrong, but I don't think much has happened with primes since
Legendre (1752-1833).
