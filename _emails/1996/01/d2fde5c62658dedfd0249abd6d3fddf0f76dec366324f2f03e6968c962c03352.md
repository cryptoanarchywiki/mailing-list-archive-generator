You make it sound so easy.  Problem is, installing this thing was clunky.
Took me a couple of times to make it even appear to install.

At least that seems to work...

I apreciate your enthusiasm, but it has failed to work a number of times for
me.  Perhaps you should study your instructions a bit more carefully for
errors.  After I get to the end of the message on Eudora, I select WPGP and
follow your instructions by clicking on the ENC button.  At this point, I
can't maximize Eudora again  to  "click on the window containing your
message" (as  you asked).  The system asks me for my password, I type it,
but when control is returned to Eudora I see neither a signature nor encryption.

Frankly, it appears to me that the biggest threat to our security at this
moment are the programs which ostensibly are supposed to protect it.  I wish
I could be more appreciative.
