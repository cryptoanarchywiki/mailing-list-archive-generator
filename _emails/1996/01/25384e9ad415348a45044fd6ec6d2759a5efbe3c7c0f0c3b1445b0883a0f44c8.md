Why Perry! I see your point! Any phenomenon that elicits articles
with titles like "Ciphers in the Crops" could have nothing at all
to do with cryptography...
I repeat: Go hump a tree. In complaining about supposed "noise,"
you cause more noise than any other person on this list. Learn
to read before you spew, or just learn to shut up!
