It seems to me that posting this widely on Compuserve (or at least on
alt.online-service.compuserve) and then contacting CNN and making comments
about how "the Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around
it" is the best way to handle this.  We want the public to get the idea
that censorship does not work on the Internet. 

Are you up for this Duncan?  Or do you want to call for volunteer, or
should this get posted anonymously.  :-) Seems better if someone does it
who is willing to talk to reporters, and who is a Compuserve user.  Makes
a better story on TV etc.
