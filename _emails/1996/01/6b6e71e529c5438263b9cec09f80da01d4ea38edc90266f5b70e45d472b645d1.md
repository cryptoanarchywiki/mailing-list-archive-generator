No, they won't be subject to such attacks any longer.

The real problem, as you noted, is that our applications aren't very
secure.

That would be somewhat meaningless. The point of a firewall, as others

Again, somewhat meaningless, as a real firewall involves defense in
depth (screening routers, a bastion proxy host, etc) and is more of a
configuration issue than an O.S. issue.
