i'm not sure. i would image so.

DS> What new risk would that create?

i would figure the server would give a minute or so for slippage.
basically the risk is that it would give someone 3 minutes to do a
brute force attack rather than one. if you have decent security on
the server side, i.e., disallow the card for 5 minutes or more after 3
or so failed attempts, brute attacks would be minimized. however, if
the actual window for a single code is 3 minutes, that increases your
chance of hitting it as 3 separate numbers would be valid for a given
card at any given time.
