This is about what I do now.  I am writing a perl program that splits the
requests up into seperate mail messages and dumps them out to the mail
program dujour.

True, but I hate seeing keys with 40 signatures on it and all of them read
"Unknown Signator".  (I am expecting someone to use "Unknown Signator" or
"Key revoked" as a nym any day now.)

Very good point!  I was actually talking about the "incredibly bogus keys
that stopped living and take up valuable keyserver space".  Keys with names
like "Wow! This is neat! I think I will create 3-4 keys a day!!!!!".  (I
actually wound up retrieving a key like this.  They are pretty annoying...)

I like that idea alot!  That way you can retrieve keys signed by people you
trust.  (Would this be the "Web of Guilt by Association"?)  It might have a
downside or two...  (Privacy for key signers?  Job seekers denied a job
because they signed the key of a known member of the four horsemen? "Are you
or have you ever been a key signer for Tim May or one of his Tentacles?")
