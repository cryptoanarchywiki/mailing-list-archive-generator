Was that with the floppy in the case, or with the case popped open...
Also:  Did you rotate the disk physically to expose the data normally 
partially shielded by the door slider?

And was it an ordinary ferrite magnet, or an alnico, or...?

Ditto!

Yes, I noticed. <G>

I will admit that at this point, even calling it a "trick" is giving it 
excessive credence.

Actually, I think it wasn't really used initially for "data hiding" 
purposes.  I'm talking about the early days of CP/M and other such systems, 
circa 1977 and such, when individuals "discovered" that floppy drives had no 
hard mechanical stop past the "last" good track, and they "stole" a few 
percent of extra capacity from a floppy by simply ignoring the recommended 
"last" track.  Naturally, it would work okay on some drives but not on 
others... which is why it was a bad idea.

In addition, I also discovered that it was possible to put a few more than 
26 sectors on each track of an 8" single-density (240 kilobytes!) floppy 
disk.  The main problem with using 
these "tricks" is that the floppy had no method of conveying formatting 
information to the system it was in, which meant that any floppy using this 
trick was by definition non-standard.  ("feature" or "bug" depending on your 
goal...)

I started building my own 12.5 MHz Z-80 -based CP/M system in 1978, fully 
designed and wire-wrapped by myself, and wrote my own BIOS.  (Used a WDC 
1791 FDC)  Had total 
control.  I didn't try this trick even then because of compatibility 
reasons, but one thing I _DID_ do was to write a floppy formatter that 
"undid" the 6-sector skewing that standard CP/M had to do to keep up with 
the data read/write. (in other words, I physically re-skewed the sector 
numbering to make the next "desired" sector come faster...) I ended up with an 
effective skew-factor of 2.  Even a skew factor of 1 worked on my system (no 
skew at all), but the problem was that when I gave the most extreme of these 
oddly skewed floppies to my friends with 8" floppies, they took A LONG TIME 
to read the data!  (Their systems always missed the next sector because their 
systems were too slow, so they only ended up being able to read one sector 
per disk rotation.)

All this helps to explain why I asked if PGP had ever been ported to CP/M.  
Nostalgia!
