Carlos Fuentes calls the rebellion the first "post-Communist" revolution. 
They specifically reject the rhetoric you set up as a straw-man. If you 
want to actually become informed about reality down there (I lived in 
Chiapas 2 winters, Guatemala 4), please subscribe to the mailing list 
that the NY Times says has prevented more Mexican Army massacres:

To subscribe to the chiapas-l list send a message to:   

	majordomo@profmexis.dgsca.unam.mx 

with these words in the body of the message: 

	subscribe chiapas-l Your-Email-Adress

and leave the subject line empty. You will receive a welcome message with
info on the group *and on how to unsubscribe*. You should save this 
message for future reference. You can expect several messages per day.

Having lived with Mayans for 6 winters I still have my heart and suggest 
you don't hold the campesinos responsible for their "emperor's" actions 
of centuries ago.

Stop fighting the cold war and against the past and transcend virtual 
reality and see how others really live and act. Or is your ignorance such 
bliss? My Mayan friends are some of the finest I have.
