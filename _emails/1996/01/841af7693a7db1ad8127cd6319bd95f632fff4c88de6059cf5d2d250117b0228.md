The paper can be found in the proceedings of Eurocrypt '91,
D.W. Davies (Ed.), Springer-Verlag.   The author is Hideki IMAI,
<tsutomu@mlab.dnj.ynu.ac.jp>.

I found the above paper very interesting, and I am actually going
to code it up.  Eventually, I would be highly interested in giving
a glance at your code.  Is your code available?

Ciao,
David
