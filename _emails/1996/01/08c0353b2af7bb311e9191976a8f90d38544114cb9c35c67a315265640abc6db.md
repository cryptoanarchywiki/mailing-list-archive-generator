This much can be accomplished by the nym-user signing all messages 
with a consistent key.  However, a signature does somewhat assert that
the signer believes the keyholder is the same John Doe that folks in the
signer's circle of acquaintances expect, and that the purported keyholder
(who may still be anonymous/pseudonymous) really holds the key,
and maybe that the keyholder is the only person with that name whose
key he's signed.
