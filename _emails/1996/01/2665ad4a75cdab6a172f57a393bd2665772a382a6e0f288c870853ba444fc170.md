Get off your high horse Julian, he means it's a modloadable version of bpf,
much like the modloadable NIT that is also available. There are at least
two sniffers that can use both the modloadable NIT and bpf packet interfaces,
maybe more. It certainly is easier than recompiling your kernel to include
the functionality which is generally the way things were done.

I prefer bpf as it is much more efficient, typically 10% of the impact that
NIT has on a machine. Some rough figures are a NIT might use one or two
minutes of CPU a day to monitor a reasonably quiet network, whilst bpf will
only use several seconds cpu time. (Most of the work is hidden in the kernel
anyway).
