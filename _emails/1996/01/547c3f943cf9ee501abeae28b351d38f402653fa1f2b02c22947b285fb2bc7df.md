    answer the questions truthfully and they can not detain you???

	yeah, that's what it says.  BS.  ask any of us who have been 
    detained by the zealots.  I was detained 36 hours at LA, 18 at 
    Dulles, etc.  If you've made the list, you've made the list, and a 
    custom's inspector with a bug up his ass is a nasty person. 

	Rule 1:	 smile regardless of the adversity
	Rule 2:	 other than the three questions on the form, say nothing
	Rule 3:  never use LA or Dulles -pick an airport with humans.

	well, I guess I had better admit it; the travelling public got 
    their money's worth in LA. after customs had shredded and Xray'd
    everything and I was tired, very tired after the long one from New
    Delhi to LA, I was hostile enough to humiliate them sufficiently to
    close all nearby lines --then I mooned them. TS and the red mask can 
    be a wonderful excuse!  I guess I just havent learned --and I was over
    50!  Dulles was previous history....  oh, yeah, they have not bugged 
    me for some time.
