For that you must be punished.

Scientifically invalid. Releasing non-native species can really wreck an
ecosystem because of the lack of evolved countermeasures. See kudzu weeds
in the South, or the Mediterranean fruit fly in California, or pigs and
sheep on tropical islands, or humans with big brains and opposable thumbs
anywhere but Africa. The better engineered solution would be to feed the
slash-and-burn farmers some other way. 

Kind of analogous to an engineer like Paul Kocher taking a hard look at
crypto systems that had only been analyzed by pure mathematicians. You 
need to feed the sniffers real entropy, not just highly evolved math.
