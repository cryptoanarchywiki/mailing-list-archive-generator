	well, Mr. Horrowitz, I once had a strong belief in democracy
    and the U.S. Constitution, particularly the Bill of Rights.

****** IMPORTANT, get your BS detector working!

	you'd probably call me a lying asshole if I told you your
    _beloved_ Bubba signed PPD 25 which permits UN control of US
    forces, _in America_!  and allows the UN to bring in UN troops.

	and, your meter will really peg out if I told you the DOD
    gave Navy Seals and Marine Recon units a long questionaire to
    determine their "loyalty" and they even asked "under an order
    to confiscate weapons from US citizens ...would you shoot to 
    kill [US citizens] who refused to surrender their weapons 
    if so ordered by UN officers?
  
	and, you'll scream "liar" if I tell you that the Department
    of the Navy is not subject to the posse comitase act which prevents
    the Army from being used in civilian affairs. Guess where the
    United States Marine Corps, the finest shock troops in history 
    are (125,000 fighting men currently)  --Navy.

	maybe you should review the procedures for the Feds --they
    have 72 hours to charge you or release you  --more if they are
    lucky enough to bag their prey after 4pm Friday --they are not
    even required to give you a phone call until you have been read
    your rights.  And, they don't read you your rights unless they
    charge you.

	second, check just what your rights are in US border check
    points --how about probable cause before they subject you to a
    strip search and body cavity check? how about liability for
    shredding your possessions if they want to be assholes, and 
    still find nothing? (you're real lucky if you get some Polish
    luggage (shopping bags)  how about some help to put your shit 
    back together?  how about a grievance procedure? --that's the 
    big joke.

	it's not INS, they couldn't give a shit about your politics,
    but if you name pops up when they "stripe" your passport, they
    pass that along to the FBI, DEA, and other LEs  

	check out LA next time you go through the Bradley gauntlet. 
    LA will take the time to punch in the numbers on a US FS passport,
    and US DP passports aint worth a shit in the US.  If they get a
    match, there's an army of those Fed blue jackets with the agency
    name on the back in large letters  --they're highly visible.

	well, I'm not passing my jacket --and you cant get it with FOIA
