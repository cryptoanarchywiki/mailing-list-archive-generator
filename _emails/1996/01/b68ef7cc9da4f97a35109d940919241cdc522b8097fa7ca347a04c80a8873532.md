This sounds like it would present the same exposure problems as an expiration
date, but perhaps be more difficult to impose. As you said above, you can
assume huge liability in a few seconds, even if you're only given a few
seconds a week. Also, I don't immediately see a way to arrange this on the
technical side that doesn't reduce to using something that expires and
replacing/refreshing it periodically. Of course, the net is in some ways
excellent for that sort of application.

How about combining value limits with time limits ?  Over the wire, using
low value limits and replacing them frequently might be a workable solution.

This sounds like a legal question, so I don't think I can offer a useful 
response.
