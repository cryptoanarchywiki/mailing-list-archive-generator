So far, very few Australian Senate documents are up on the net (honourable
exception:  those of those of the Committee on 'Community Standards' and
on-line services);  but keep your eye on them, and maybe they'll catch up:

Steve Orlowski from the Australian Attorney-General's Department wrote a
paper in November/December 1995 which outlined the idea.  He's given me
permission to put it up.  Me?  I'm just playing proxy until A-G's really
come to believe in this medium (:-)}
