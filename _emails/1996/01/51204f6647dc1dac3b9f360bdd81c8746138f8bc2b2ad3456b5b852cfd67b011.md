In "Castle Wolfenstein" you run around shooting Nazis, just as in
"Doom" you run around shooting demons.

And similarly Zundel is not a Nazi, he is an anti fascist.

Hmm, these "Anti nazi laws" look suspicious like pro Nazi laws.

Seems that the government of Germany is primarily concerned about
their own hurt feelings, and to hell with the hurt feeling of the
Jews.
