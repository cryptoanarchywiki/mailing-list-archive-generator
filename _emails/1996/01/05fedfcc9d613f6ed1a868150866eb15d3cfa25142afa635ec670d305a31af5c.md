I downloaded it and checked it out.  But it was not clear how to use this
secure email - so it may lack something yet in user friendlyness, or I may
have just missed it.  Anyway, it should be much easier to use than PGP. 
Are we all going to switch to Netscape for email?  Is anyone using this? 
Want to tell us how?
