Just got something in the post today asking for me to set up an account with
them...

- Daily reconciled bank statement and checkbook register; All transactions
are logged for you.
- No min balance
- 20 free electronic bill payments per month...
- ATM at Honor and Cirus..
- 200 free paper checks...
- plenty of pre-stamped deposit envolopes
- FDIC insured accounts (in case anyone ever steals my password..)
- Wired Funds..


I haven't check out the web sight yet but it is at http://www.sfnb.com

If there are no fees, I just might do it anyways and get the free-tshirt
they are offering me! <grin>
