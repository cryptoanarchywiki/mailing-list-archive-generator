Oxford University, University of Milan, and Finnish University Network
not big enough for you?  I usually get my PGP code from Oxford.
Now, if MIT were willing to distribute other code from their server,
it would make it easier for people to put their names on their postings,
which would be a Good Thing, without the need for posting to sci.crypt
with Distribution: usa or anonymously remailing encrypted copies or whatever.
