Simple. It's been done.

We will organize reasonable mirrors of any site not involved in overt
law-breaking that is actively blocked by any "Major Indistrial Democracy." 
I don't think I'm quite ready to take on Cuba, China, North Korea, etc. 
Disk space and bandwidth are increasingly cheap these days.

Go ahead. Make my day. You want to firewall every educational and
non-profit organization in what's left of the free world?
