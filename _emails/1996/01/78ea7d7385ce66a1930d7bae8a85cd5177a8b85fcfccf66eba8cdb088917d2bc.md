My name is rare and matched mostly by lists of the highest points of
elevation in each state (Mt. Frissell in Connecticut) and museum shows of
the work of a distant cousin Toni Frissell who was a fashion photographer in
NYC.  Most of the rest is mine.  If you have a common name/nym it would be
harder to track (except by searching for email address rather than name).
