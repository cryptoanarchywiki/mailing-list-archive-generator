He was not the only one.

Due to the vicissitudes of the C'punks' list, my correction
arrived before my post for some people.  the URL is:

			www.ocra.com

As Tim correctly pointed out, the Net has carried information on
offshore banking and related topics for some time.  My point was
that--as far as I can tell--OCRA is the first major one-stop
supplier of offshore incorporation, trust and banking services
to open a Web site.

More important, though, is the content of their site.  Whether
or not one does business with them, their site offers a very
good primer on the whys and wherefors of going offshore.

P.S.  I've received a couple of dozen RSVPs for my costume
      party on 10 February.  I'd like those of you who will
      be in the Bay Area on that date and have not responded
      to let me know if you will or will not be in attendance.  
      Also, if you have any suggestions for a free or cheap
      band, let me know.
