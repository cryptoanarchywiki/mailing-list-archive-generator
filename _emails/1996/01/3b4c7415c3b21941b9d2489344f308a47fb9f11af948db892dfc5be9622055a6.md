I guess one thing politicians should consider _real_ hard is whether they
want the Internet to be ruled by the lowest common denominator
(so to speak).

If the US (or Germany etc.) wants to impose it's version of morality/PC
then it really doesn't have any grounds to complain when other countries
decided to do so.
