An excellent introductory cryptography textbook that's oriented toward
number theory is:

     A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography, 2nd ed.
     by Neal Koblitz
     Springer Verlag

If you want a "classic" number theory text, I recommend:

     An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers, 5th ed.
     by G.H. Hardy and E.M. Wright
     Clarendon Press, Oxford University Press

If you'd like a good introduction to factoring, try:

     Factorisation and Primality Testing
     by David Bressoud
     Springer Verlag

Of course, it goes without saying that anyone studying cryptography ought
to have a copy of:

     Applied Cryptography, 2nd ed.
     by Bruce Schneier
     John Wiley

Hope that helps.
