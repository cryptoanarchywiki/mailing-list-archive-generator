No progress? At least Phil is not going off on a trip to Alcatraz to
make small ones out of big ones. Thats a big plus in many peoples books.

One of the most overdue reforms of the US government is the renaming of
the FBI building to remove the name of J Edgar Hoover. The abuse of power 
under his administration of the FBI continues to poison the US polity
by providing clear proof to many citizens that their government cannot be 
trusted. While the abuses of Hoover continue to be commemerated in this
fashion there can be little public confidence in any claims of reform.

Not just the US government. There are many crooks out there who have attempted
or are attempting worse. At least with the government there are means to
bring it to heel eventually.
