The problem is not with the license, but with the software. And not with the 
latest software, but with some antique software we started using a long time 
ago (before RSAREF was a twinkle in anyone's eye) when 760 bit RSA keys and 64 
bit RC2/RC4 keys seemed impenetrable. Given that interoperability with the 
installed base is a higher priority than resistance to some theoretical attack, 
we can't increase key sizes until the market rolls over to the latest software. 
We do have plans to get there.
