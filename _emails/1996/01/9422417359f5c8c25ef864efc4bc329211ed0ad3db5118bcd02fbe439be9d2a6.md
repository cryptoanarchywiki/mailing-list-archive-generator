Actually, I'm pretty sure it was Eric Hughes who said something like
(apologies if I'm misquoting or misremembering) "The most profitable
course of action, for a person who discovers a security hole, is almost
always to keep quiet about it."  It's very easy to see how a criminal
can make money with this approach, but it's much harder to see how a
legitimate business could do so.  We did what we thought was the
responsible thing, and tried to describe it in terms that were also in
our business interest.

Now, if I figure out how to really *solve* this problem, that would be
worth patenting.... :-) -- NB
