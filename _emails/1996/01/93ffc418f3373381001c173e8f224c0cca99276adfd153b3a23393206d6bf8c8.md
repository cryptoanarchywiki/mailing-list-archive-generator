As a point of information, the operators of the "Amateur Action" bulletin
board in Fremont, California are now sitting in prison because they
e-mailed material fully legal in California but illegal (the court
determined) in Memphis, Tennessee.

And, yes, there are many things which are "constitutionally protected"
inside the U.S. but which are crimes in Europe and elsewhere. (And things
that are legal in Europe, but illegal in the U.S., and all permutations.)
One can write a book in the U.S. and receive a death sentence in Iran.

Get used to it. It makes no sense for us to whine and complain about
Country A outlawing some activity that is legal in Country B.

The thing for us to do is to use technology and code to subvert and bypass
laws of any country which are repressive and controlling.
