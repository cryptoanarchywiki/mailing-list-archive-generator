    reply from attila:

	I would say we have two clueless mud slingers amongst us.

    1.	Robin Gedye (in Bonn) for ET who is not only clueless, but
	totally without journalistic ethicss in the of the muckraker
	and yellow journalism of the old line Hearst tabloid size
	newspapers.  to stir a fire on PZ sinc he wrote a virtually
	universal world wide crypto program is....

    2.	and closer to home, we have a yea-sayer mouse: "anonymous-
	user@c2.org" whose does not have the courtesy to pose 
	the question to PZ; and EVEN WORSE, slings mud anonymously.

	granted, PZ is just a man, but he's like you and I. would
    you not consider the source before opening the floodgates of
    character smear?  It sounds like you forgot to clutch in your
    brain before shooting from a duck-blind with your fingers.
