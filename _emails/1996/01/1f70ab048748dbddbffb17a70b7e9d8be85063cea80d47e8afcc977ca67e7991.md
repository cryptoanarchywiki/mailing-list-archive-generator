  Friends, 
 
 
  01 14 96 Edupage includes: 
 
  PRETTY GOOD PHONE PRIVACY, TOO
 
  Now from the creator of PGP encryption software comes a new 
  product for making your phone calls more private.  Philip 
  Zimmermann's PGPfone software scrambles phone calls made 
  through a computer modem using a complex algorithm called 
  Blowfish, which rearranges the digital version of your voice 
  conversation and then decodes it at the other end.  The result 
  is an intelligible -- though not high-quality -- totally pri- 
  vate conversation. 
 
  The URL is:

  (Popular Science Jan 96 p43)
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim
