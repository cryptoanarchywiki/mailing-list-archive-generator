Nothing at all.  But it's still not an automated mass-scale attack,
because that's only one piece of the mechanism (which we spell out) for
breaking FV.  The essence of FV's security is that we don't believe that
there's any single bit of technology or magic (cryptographic or
otherwise) that provides security, and that real security comes from a
series of complex defenses.  This approach is particularly good at
discouraging automated attacks.

Moreover, this attack is almost guaranteed to leave traces and be
detected within a single billing cycle.  Once the credit card bill comes
in, the patch in Eudora/Netscape will be discovered, and people will
start looking for its source.  In contrast, the scheme I have outlined
steals credit card numbers without any connection to the point of theft,
which in practice will mean that the attack will go undiagnosed and
without countermeasures for a lot longer, because there will be no
obvious correlation to the Internet as a point of theft.

Typically, they flow over the web, where there's no email address
present.  You need traffic analysis.  Just makes it harder to automate,
that's all.

We're very proud of it because it's the competition.

That included the user interface and a number of precautionary
mechanisms, with very careful coding to make sure that there weren't
hidden problems that would bite us.  The engineer who wrote it is very
good, but I also know that several people have since duplicated the
basic mechanism in a day or two.

Right.  And the key, as I keep saying, is automation.  You have to
defend against an automated attack.

Actually, one of your methods is very close to my preferred method, but
there are still some better wrinkles possible.  I prefer to leave them
as an exercise for the reader -- my academic background, I guess.  :-)
