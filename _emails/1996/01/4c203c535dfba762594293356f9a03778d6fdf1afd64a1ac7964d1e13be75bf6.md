You don't have to go as far as calling it a conspiracy.  Remember
statement (5) that I posted yesterday:

(5) Performing a defense service on behalf of, or for the benefit of, a
foreign person, whether in the United States or abroad.

If Netscape had "helped" Eric write SSLEAY, that would count as a defense
service for the benefit of a foreign person.

Section 120.9:

@ 120.9 -- Defense service.

   Defense service means:

   (1) The furnishing of assistance (including training) to foreign persons,
whether in the United States or abroad in the design, development, engineering,
manufacture, production, assembly, testing, repair, maintenance, modification,
operation, demilitarization, destruction, processing or use of defense articles;
or

   (2) The furnishing to foreign persons of any technical data controlled under
this subchapter (see @ 120.10), whether in the United States or abroad.
