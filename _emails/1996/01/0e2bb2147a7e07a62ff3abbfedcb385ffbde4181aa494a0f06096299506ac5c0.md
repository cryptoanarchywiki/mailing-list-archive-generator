I have sent two requests myselt in the last two months that have gone 
unanswered.  The request was to have isdn.net added to the allowed 
list.  I know the initial rejection was the .net domain, but the 
location should not be hard to look up - just a basic whois.  

I got PGP from alternative locations, but still have not been able to 
get PGPhone.
