> The thingie remains unchanged. (Sounds prophetic, no?) When you sign up for

> credit-card account, we take an imprint of your card in lieu of a deposit

> $40. You, as a customer, agree to let us go back to your credit card and
> replenish the account based on a pre-agreed amount when the balance reaches
> a minimum level (typically $10). We also do the same for checking accounts
> (automatic withdrawl) and have cash options for those customers who aren't
> comfy with recurring automatic transactions on their card or account. The
> replenishment of the accounts is system-based -- that is, you don't need to
> physically bring your transponder in for a "fill up."

> The project is a true express lanes configuration -- no intermediate

> Flexible channelizers form the barrier between the freeway and the project,
> so in an emergency you could get out if you needed to.

> Because the project was dedicated as part of the state highway system
