Someone got a McArthur grant for a study of this in Redwood City a couple
years back. She studied the long-term patterns of smuggling between towns
in the SF Bay Peninsula and central Mexico. I saw her speak once, but I
don't remember her name. I could probably find the reference if you're
interested. There haven't been that many McArthur grants.

Any decent book on private investigation should give you enough
information to pass as someone else.
