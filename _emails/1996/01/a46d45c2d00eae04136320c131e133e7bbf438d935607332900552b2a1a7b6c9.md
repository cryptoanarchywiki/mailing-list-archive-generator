  If there is someone that you trust (or several people), just make a 
revocation certificate and possibly cut it into pieces, and just let 
those know when to send it out, so that you don't have to rely on a 
faulty memory, and by having it in several hands they can't just send it 
out, as they don't know the other people.  Just a thought.
