I don't speak my credit card number into the FV line, I DTMF it.
Whats more, I do so after the interactive voice system says the words
'credit card.'  In fact, a group of people may have been running a tap
& scan on FV's line for a long time now, using each number they steal
once.

	Credit cards are crappy financial instruments, made useful
mainly by the governments limitations of liability rules.  Why defend
them?

	FV's attack is pretty bogus, but no more bogus, and possibly
less, than the Power One Time Pads.  We're going to see a lot of smoke
and mirrors in the next few years regarding security.

	Anyone have anything to say about RC2?  Someone must have
written a main() for it?
