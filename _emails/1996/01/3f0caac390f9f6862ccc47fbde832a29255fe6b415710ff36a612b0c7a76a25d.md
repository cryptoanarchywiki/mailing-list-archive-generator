I didn't comment when the first remark was made, several days ago, but if
others are going to elaborate on it, I will now comment.

The government cannot simply take its cut before sending the stipend/salary
for a very good reason: they don't know the final tax rates of the
taxpayers!

Some people will end up paying no taxes, for whatever reasons (low overall
wages, lots of deductions and dependents, offsetting capital losses, etc.).
Others will pay 20%, and some may even pay more (doubtful, on a stipend,
but you get the point).

Clearly the government cannot simply "withold" 15%, say, nor can it know in
advance the precise amount to withold. A flat tax rate would make this more
possible, but would still not be completely accurate.
