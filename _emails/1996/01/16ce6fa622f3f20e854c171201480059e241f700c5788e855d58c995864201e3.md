Yet more incentive for starting a bank somewhere in the free world...

Ecash really would be a lot nicer if it were implemented in a 
multi-issuer system with even more choices for storing your money, like 
in an ecash money market account at a non-issuing institution.  I can wait.

I agree that there's little point in storing ecash on your hard drive 
past a slush amount for purchases (hopefully the sw will be smart enough 
to advise people as to how much to keep on hand)...ecash still requires a 
check with the bank before spending any cash, correct?  Ecash on disk 
doesn't protect against denial-of-service-through-networking attacks 
then.  Keeping ecash at MTB, however, wouldn't be my reason for keeping 
it at a remote location.  Probably.

If I had to conduct all of my banking in accordance with 
Mark Twain's fee schedule and legal restrictions, I'd be buying another 
mattress right now..well, maybe pillowcase.    

By integrating all of these services under Mark Twain Bank Ecash Mint, I 
would get all of the advantages of a rather pricey bank, 4-5% loss on all 
my deposits, minimal privacy protection, no FDIC protection, $2500 
initial deposit (not a problem for me, but it does keep many of the 
people I'd like to send money to out of the system..always a feature), 
and _tens_ of places to spend my ecash, only 4 or 5 of which that really 
sell things.
