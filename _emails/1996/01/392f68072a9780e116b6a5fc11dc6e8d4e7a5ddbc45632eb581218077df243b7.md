This "Chinese Wall" exists in many other branches of the IC.

I saw this in a specific physical security area; Red Team tried to (say)
build a wall; Black Team worked on new ways through it. We (another
agency with an interest in walls) could & did get advice on
wall-building from Red; but the Blacks would not talk to either the Red
Team nor us.

Trying to predict the posture of the Fort _in general_ from the PhilZ
case strikes me as a less accurate than throwing darts blindfolded...
from a rollercoaster.
