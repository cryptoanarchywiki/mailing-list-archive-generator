If I were a PR sort of person, and interested in funding a "liberation
channel" into the countries behind the "Silicon Curtain," I'd think about a
catchy name for the program.

Not radio, of course, just a nod to the olden days of "Radio Free Europe"
and "Voice of America" (which was, unfortunately, partly staffed by former
members of the Mobile Killing Squads which rounded up Russian Jews).
