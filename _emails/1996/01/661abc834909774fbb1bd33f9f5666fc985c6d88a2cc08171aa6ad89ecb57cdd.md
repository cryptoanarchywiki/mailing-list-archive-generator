   Fred B. Wrixon writes in "Codes and Ciphers," under the
   "Public Key" entry:

      ... This Hellman-Diffie proposal was apparently
      anticipated by a similar version developed by the
      National Security Agency (NSA) a decade earlier.
      (p. 164)

   No citation or elaboration is given for this claim.

   Wrixon's book is a simply written compendium:

      Codes and Ciphers: An A to Z of Covert Communication,
      from the Clay Tablet to the Microdot.
