I believe that David Gelerntner, the professor of computer
science at Yale University injured by a UNABOMBER bomb, is also
a supporter of the Clipper chip. This may or may not be
something that arose from the bombing. But I'm not sure how many
cavaets and things he adds to his position. He may have changed
it. But then he's not exactly a cryptographer.

But, on the other side of the fence, I just passed a section in
_Takedown_ where Shimomura and the FBI agents decide that the
best place for the Clipper phones is "in the trunk." Apparently
they don't communicate with regular phones so they were
practically worthless.
