I spoke to one of the case agents who was in on the bust while at a 
Computer Crime Conference at Quantico.  I don't recall any other tidbits 
at the moment, but I'll think about it again.  They were fairly 
closemouthed about the whole thing because it was reasonably soon after 
the arrest and the case was just getting going (that is, the "case" in 
court, not the "matter" under investigation -- U.S. Attorney-speak).
