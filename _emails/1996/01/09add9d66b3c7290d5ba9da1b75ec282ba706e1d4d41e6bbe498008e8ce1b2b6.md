I use Aegis right now and I have only one major problem with it.  It does
not have a facility to do word wraps in the program before signing.  This
means that if you use it with Eudora and word wrap is on, all of your sigs
are going to be bad.  (And hitting return on every line before feeding it
through is a pain in the ass.)

On the other hand, I have heard that WPGP is not very stable under Win95.
Can't win for losing...
