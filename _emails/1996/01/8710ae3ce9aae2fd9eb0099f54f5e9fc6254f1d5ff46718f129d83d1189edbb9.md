Apparently the file name of the official position on Access security is
wx1051.exe. It should be on CompuServe and www/ftp.microsoft.com.

Among other wondrous things, Peter Miller writes in article
<4crdu2$gua@news-e1a.megaweb.com> in comp.databases.ms-access:

  BTW, there's a typo in the White Paper.  Where it says Access security
  relies upon 'RSA4 data encryption', they meant to say 'you not knowing
  the difference between a secure database application, and one that
  just contains a bunch of security dialogs that confuses the average
  user, but fails to protect either your code or your data'.

I bet someone's going to have a lot of fun with this one!!!
