The URL of my Crypto Law Survey has been changed several times over
the past month due to changes in servers. Apologies.

It is now located at
http://cwis.kub.nl/~frw/people/koops/lawsurvy.htm
(and it is meant to stay there :-)).

So, please put pointers to this new URL, and accept my apologies for
the inconvenience.

To make up for this, I have updated the survey with all recent
events, such as the ICC meeting in Paris and the recent discovery of
a crypto law in Belgium, and added a few links. As always, comments
are more than welcome.

Kind regards,
Bert-Jaap
