Correct; here's my two Simoleons' worth toward exorcising the "Churchill
Anguished Over Coventry Bombing" meme:

    The first international conference of cryptologists took place in
    Germany in November of 1978.  The backroom boys of World War II --
    Allied communications intelligence experts and Axis communications
    security specialists -- met under scholarly sponsorship to try to
    determine the effect of codebreaking on the war. [...] Dr. Forrest
    Pogue, author of the standard biography of General George C. Marshall,
    U.S. Army chief of staff, said that [...] 15 to 20 years is the time
    lag for facts to catch up with fiction.  That's how long it will take
    for the false story that Winston Churchill allowed Coventry to be
    destroyed to save the secret of ULTRA "to stop being used to keep
    sophomores awake in the classroom."
