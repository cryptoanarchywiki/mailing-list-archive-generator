It's an open question as to whether there's a version that works
in base 10.  There's a nice summary at
"http://www.mathsoft.com/asolve/plouffe/plouffe.html".

It does seem strange, but radix conversion can be much more expensive
than the baseline algorithm.  I vaguely remember hearing that
the billion-digit pi computations done with AGM techniques haven't
dealt with base 10 recently.
