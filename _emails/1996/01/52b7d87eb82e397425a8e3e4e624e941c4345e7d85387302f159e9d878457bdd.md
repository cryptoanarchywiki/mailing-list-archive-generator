And this is from a post I sent to the list last summer:
***************************************************************
I just read 'Infamy' by John Toland (1982), containing 'proof'
- very convincing, in my opinion - of the Pearl Harbour cover-up.
The US president, selected members of his cabinette and a
few admirals and generals knew - from Magic and the 'winds'
execute, radio traffic analysis, diplomatic sources, double
agents - exactly when and where the Japaneese were going to
attack, but didn't warn Hawaii, fearing that too efficient
counter-measures by the Oahu military might make the attack
abort and so not convince the isolationists. The unexpected 
tactical capabilities of the Japaneese armada then made a
cover-up all the more important.
*****************************************************************

The unfortunate cipher expert Captain Safford spent most of
his post-war life trying to uphold the honour of his fellow
cryptanalysts, putting the blame on generals and politicians,
but in vain.

'Infamy' is an interesting book.
