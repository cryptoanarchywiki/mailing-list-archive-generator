"Tanks"? We have no tanks, only cryptography.

Looks like the cypherpunks@toad.com address, instead of majordomo@toad.com
address, has again been put out in some book. (In this case, something
called the "Happy Mutant Handbook.") Get read for another onslaught.

For "Weaselicious," you can subscribe to the Cypherpunks mailing list by
sending a message to

majordomo@toad.com

with a body message of

subscribe cypherpunks

(Send this from the e-mail address which you wish subscribed to the list.)

You will receive a welcome message with more information, including the
all-important information on how to UNSUBSCRIBE. Don't lose this message,
as yoy may need it.
