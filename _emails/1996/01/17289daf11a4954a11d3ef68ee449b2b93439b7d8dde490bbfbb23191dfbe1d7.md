Yes.  That's why an API that supported generic data transforms and
that included compression and for non-export encryption would be a useful
thing.  I have a start toward such an API definition that I will email to
anyone who might wanna finish it off.  I started doing it around the time
that Raph talked about his per-user crypto server.

They define a hook.  They define it on a case-by-case basis.  "They" is
the Office of Defence Trade Controls, in conjunction with their consulting
experts primarily people in the department of Export Control at the NSA.
Luckily the ITAR talks about willful violations.
