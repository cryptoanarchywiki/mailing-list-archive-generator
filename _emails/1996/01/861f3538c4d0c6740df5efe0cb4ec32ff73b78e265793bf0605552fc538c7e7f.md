already believe it, but I _KNOW_ it!

Klaatu Barada Nikto.     This will become important...soon

Something is going to happen.  Something...wonderful!


(BTW, the above few lines, which looks like a canned signature, is not.
Careful readers will note that I keep typing it in, which means that it
isn't identical every time.  This should be a clue to all you lurkers out
