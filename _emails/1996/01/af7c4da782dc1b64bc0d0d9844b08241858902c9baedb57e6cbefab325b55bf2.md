  Is your attempt to disable cookies all together or just disable
persistent (last across multiple sessions) cookies?  If you want
to disable persistent cookies and you are running on unix you can
just chmod the cookies file to be un-writable.  I don't believe that
there is a way to disable cookies in general.

  We send headers for proxies, caching, fetching byte ranges, and
cookies.  Some of these are part of HTTP 1.0 or extensions that
are being worked on in IETF or W3C working groups.

> 3) Can we go completely stealth inside of Netscape without a proxy server?

  No.  Right now you can't disable cookies, you can't disable
referer, and you can't mask your IP address.  I'd like to add
an option to disable everything that we can in some future
release, but there is nothing I can do about the IP address.
