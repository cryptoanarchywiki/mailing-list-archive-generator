I LOVE this response!  This is the kind of comment that totally destroys 
Rich Graves' position: Graves' would allow the government to screw with US, 
as ordinary citizens, while we're denied the ability to defend ourselves.  

Maybe I was excessively rude by calling Rich Graves a "fucking statist" on 
this list, but I don't think I was at all inaccurate.

Thank you for putting Rich Graves in his place.
