What if the nym is linked to a real person? There are nyms on this list
that people here have met in person, talked with on the phone, etc. Say
that person verifies their key fingerprint. Should one sign the key? I have
signed keys of people without seeing their ID, because I and everyone else
I know knows them under the name on the key.

What if I watch someone _generate_ a key under the nym "Master Blaster"? I
know that "Master Blaster" isn't their real name. Does that mean I
shouldn't sign the key?
