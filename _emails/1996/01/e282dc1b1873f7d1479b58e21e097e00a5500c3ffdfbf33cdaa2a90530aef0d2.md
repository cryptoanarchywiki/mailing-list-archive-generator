You are correct.  I'm afraid I was thinking one thing and typing another.

What I meant to say is that the attacker has an algorithm that effectively 
cuts my keySIZE (instead of keyspace) in half,  i.e. his algorithm requires 
him to try on average only 2^1023 keys (instead of 2^2047 for a brute force 
attack) to crack my key of 2048 bits.

Thanks for pointing this out.
