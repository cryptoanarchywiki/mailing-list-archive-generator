Does anyone know of a web server that uses PGP instead of SSL or STT or 
whatever is the new acronym of the week for secure web transactions?

A server would have its public key available for anyone get.  All 
transactions that need encrypting would be encrypted to the server by using 
the public key.  PGP 3.0's API would make this even easier (or so I've 
heard).

The reverse could also be implemented.  By using some identifying 
characteristic of the user (maybe a user defined name) and the 
corresponding PGP key, data could be transmitted securely to the user.
