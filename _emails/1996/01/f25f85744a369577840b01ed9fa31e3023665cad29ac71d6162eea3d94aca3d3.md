Looks good to me -- I think that should work.

I guess that goes to show my lack of creativity. :-)

I was talking to Avi Rubin from Bellcore last night, and he speculated
that maybe the 64 bit key was a fixed one, generated once at installation
time and escrowed with the government then.

With a fixed pre-escrowed key, the receiver wouldn't have to do any
checking; and it would obviate the need for a LEEF/BARF/... field.
On the other hand, it seems to me like one should be able to disable
this fixed pre-escrowed key mechanism with a little binary patch.

I guess we need hard technical details.
