: Does anyone know if there really is just one 24-bit key for every copy of

: together to find the 1's that don't change and then OR them to find the 0's
: until you've got the 24 bit key).  Someone, please tell me that's not how it
: works (or post the 24-bit key  :>).

That was the question that came to mind when I read the article, too.
How exactly are they planning on implementing this?  I admit my ignorance
concerning the working of Lotus Notes and how it handles keys.  Do they 
plan on escrowing a unique partial key for each licence? For each user?
Can users have multiple keys?  If so, how does this affect the key generation 
process.  

At first glance, unless the feds are gonna hand out keys via 
men-with-shiny-black-shoes-and-handcuffed-to-briefcases, the key
generation process is going to have to contact the feds and reveal the key.
Of course, I'm relatively new to this (gonna read Schneier real soon now ;) )
so I may be woefully off base, but this is my first reaction.

Is this partial escrow similar to saying, "We won't kill you, we'll just
amputate at the neck?"
