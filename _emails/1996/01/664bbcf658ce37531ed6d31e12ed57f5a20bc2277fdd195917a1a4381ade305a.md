This is misleading.  The Engineer was known to be surrounded by 
cellphones all the time.  Many of his closer supporters would take calls 
for him on their phones and hand the phone over for him to talk on.  This 
is why the ploy worked.  No real way to notice that his "regular" phone 
was exchanged for a new shiny one with a bulging battery pack or somesuch.
