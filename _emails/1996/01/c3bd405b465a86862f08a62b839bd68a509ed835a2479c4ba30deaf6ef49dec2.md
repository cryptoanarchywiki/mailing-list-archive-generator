The big companies are fighting? Where did you get that idea? IBM/Lotus just
gave the feds the keys. Not a single one of the major players has
challenged the government in any meaningful way. Sure, they make a lot of
noise as to how they dislike the regulations, but they certainly aren't
making a sincere effort of trying to change them.
