I can also think of another good reason that no dissident in their right
mind would want to use US escrowed GAK.  How many times have individuals
been sold out for some "greater good".  I can just imagine some dissident
getting sold out as the result of some mega-trade deal or the like.  (And I
am sure that they can too...)

Why does this news report sound more like someone trying to sell GAK to the
US public and not "chinese dissidents?
