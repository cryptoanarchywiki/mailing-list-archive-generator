Actually the MAD doctrine is critically dependent on mutual knowledge
concerning military capability. I have met UK intelligence types who
have discussed how they have deliberately permitted Soviet espionage
activities in order that they could confirm that the NATO alliance was
a defensive one.

Throughout the majority of the cold war both sides took great pains
to avoid creating a situation which forced the other into nuclear
brinkmanship. Indeed until Regan there were strenuous efforts made to
preserve the balance of power.

They probably should do, the NSA was critical in ensuring the demise
of the USSR and in maintaining stability throughout the cold war period.

The point is not that the NSA had no military function. The point is that
it is now an agency searching for a role. It is often a dangerous thing
for the military to involve itself in civil affairs.
