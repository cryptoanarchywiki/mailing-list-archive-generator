So is the idea beyond this that if file or a group of files were to 
be distributed over many computers (possibly hundreds or more) then 
none of the computers would be "responsible" for their content? I would 
think that any participant in the network would have to claim full 
responsibility for the content, assuming the file(s) could be accessed 
from any of the participating servers.

I'd be interesting in joining the Unmuzzy (programmers) mailing list, does 
anyone know what the email is or where the home page is? A net search 
returned nothing.
