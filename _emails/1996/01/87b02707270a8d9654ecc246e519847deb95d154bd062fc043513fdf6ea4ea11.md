The target, Homer Wilson Smith, is one of the people embroiled in
the Scientology wars.  I don't want to get into the recent history
of repression and abuse by Scientology agents & sympathizers, but
my guess is that this is an attempt to harass someone that
Scientology doesn't like.

They (Scientology) have shown a remarkable ability to grasp both the
technical details and social implications of the Internet and use them
to harass ex "church" members and people who say things that they
don't like.  The "church" undoubtably hates remailers because so many
of their critics post anonymously through them.  But as they discovered
with Usenet news, the same technology can be used to harass those
critics.

I think we'll see more ingenous attacks like this, using CP-tech in
perverted ways to harass people.  Annoying for sure, but helpful in
a way- they'll help debug the technology.  Like cipherpunks hacking
Netscape, in the end it just makes it stronger.
