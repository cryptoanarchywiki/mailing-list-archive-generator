	I agree with your points that the press should write real
articles, and not just swallow press releases. The fact of the matter
though, is that that's what they do, swallow press releases. It's a
said state of affairs, but that is the state of affairs.
	I wouldn't say *all* news is PR controlled, but most of it
is. It's much less work for the reporter when an article just shows up
on their desk and all they have to do is call one or two people for
some fresh quotes.
