Interesting reply, Duncan.  Since you've addressed many of the points,
I'll just add a few short points.

	The term "crypto anarchy" is a label for a new, and still
evolving school of thought.  To take it to soley encompass anarchy as
a result would be as false as assuming that Utilitarians only take
utility in its restired sense, and not pleasure into thier
calculations.  Mill, in the first paragraph of chapter II of
'Utilitarianism' discusses the idea, that an idea, through its
simple label, is dismissed.

	I would argue that it lacks industry acceptance, and the only
acceptance is that of the lesser of evils, not a warm embrace.

	Futher, the idea that unfettered cryptography will lead to the
end of the nation state, while embraced by both Denning and Frissel,
is not obvious.  There are many aspects of police work which will be
continued, and continue to address many of the crimes that worry Dr.
Denning.  Undercover cops can partake in a grey or black market more
easily when the tools of anonymity are available to all.  If the
market is for physical items, those items must be delivered.
