I wish that didn't make so much sense to me.  I can certainly see things from th
sysadmin's point of view.

That's exactly what I'm doing for the moment.  After my current job starts payin
I'll shop around services like C2 and see who has a faster news feed than my 
current ISP.  Things take way too long to get here sometime.

By the way, plug plug plug, I wrote up a short set of instructions on posting 
through gateways with Private Idaho and put it on alt.security.pgp.  An Alta 
Vista or Deja News search would turn it up.  I can also mail it out to anyone wh
would like a helping hand with it.
