you think that's a bit ridiculous?  i'm paid via an NIH grant given to my 
adivisor by the govt.  this stipend is taxed.  it didn't used to be 
(started to be taxed around '86  i believe).  why the hell doesn't the 
govt just save everyone the trouble and pay me less.  i'm sure they could 
get rid of a couple of IRS people this way.
