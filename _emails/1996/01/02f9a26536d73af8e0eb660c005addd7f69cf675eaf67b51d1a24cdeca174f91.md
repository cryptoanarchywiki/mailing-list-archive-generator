April 12, 1994 --           the CIA released a document in February
1994 called "A Consumer's Guide to Intelligence". My copy arrived today,
so I will provide a review for interested parties. 

This item has a slick marketing feel to it, similar to that of a prospectus
for a new stock or something given to prospective car buyers. It's even
printed on glossy paper. About the only thing missing, that other marketing
documents have, is color photographs of happy employees. Apparently, in
this era of shrinking budgets, it was prepared to "sell" the Intelligence
Community to various government officials. In fact, inside the front cover,
is the statement "This publication is prepared for the use of US government
officials, and the format, coverage, and content are designed to meet
their specific requirements."

So, what's the content like? It discusses what various intelligence
agencies actually do, types of intelligence, how intelligence is collected
(helpful tip: if you have just come back from an exotic foreign country,
the U.S. government would really like to have a friendly chat with you...)
and the reports that can be provided to policymakers. For example, if you
have enough political clout, you can get a free subscription to the
following (quoted verbatim from page 23 of the CIA publication):
  Defense Intelligence Agency Current Assessments
  _______________________________________________
  A tabloid product that provides a brief and timely assessment of an
  ongoing military or military-related situation or recent development
  considered highly significant to national-level decisionmakers.
Given the word "tabloid" one wonders if it features lurid New York Post
style headlines, such as "Serbian general's secret Bosnian girlfriend"...

There are a few surprises though. For example, among current large consumers
of intelligence information, it lists the Department of Agriculture and
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). They also discuss the rarely
mentioned MASINT field (Measurements and Signatures Intelligence). MASINT
involves using scientists and engineers to study other characteristics
of intelligence information gathered. For example, although it is not
stated in this publication, it is believed that MASINT specialists studied
the spectral characteristics of Soviet rocket exhausts to determine the
fuel mixture used in the rocket.

How does one obtain a copy of this document? It is available for $12.50
to addresses in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and $25.00 elsewhere. (There
was an error in the NTIS database entry I posted earlier which indicated the
price was $17.50). Also, you need to add $3.00 for postage per order (not
per copy) in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, and $4.00 for postage elsewhere.
To order, make checks payable to NTIS, and request item # PB93-928021 from
  U.S. Department of Commerce
  National Technical Information Service
  Springfield, VA  22161
  phone (703) 487-4650
Ask for a free copy of their catalog of products and services.

So, is it worth ordering? If you are interested in intelligence, I recommend
this publication. Also, it might be a good thing to leave laying around on
your coffee table if you have "politically correct" visitors...
