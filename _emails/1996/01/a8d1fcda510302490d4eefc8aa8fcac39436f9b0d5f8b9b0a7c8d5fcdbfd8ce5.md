I have edited the name of this virus so as to minimized its damage. I read
that even _typing_ the phrase "g**d t*m*s v*r*s" in its full form can cause
the information stored in the phrease "g**d t*m*s v*r*s" to unpack itself,
install itself on all types of disk drives, and then initialize the disks.

I hope we caught it in time!

(More seriously, I notice that "alt.folklore.suburban@c2.org" was in the
distribution list for the message I'm replying to (pared out by me on this
message). I really hope that this does not mean what I think it means, that
"alt.folklore.suburban" is not being copied! The cross-contamination of
many mailing lists is one thing, but cross-contaminating our mailing list
and Usenet groups would truly be the work of the Army of the Twelve
Monkeys.)
