Given the usefulness of an HP calculator as a secure point
of encryption, someone might be interested in my old calculator.
I haven't used it since I graduated, except for balancing my
old business books, way overkill.  I'd love to give it a good home.


HP 48 GX Calculator
  The most powerful calculator in the world
  Currently loaded with many Applied Math and Engineering
  programs written by myself (yours free with the calculator ;-)
  About 2 years old, excellent condition
  $125, negotiable

HP IR Calculator Printer
  Infrared printer for the HP line of calculators
  Very light, battery operated
  About 2 years old, excellent condition
  $75, negotiable


Please contact me if you are interested.

My apologies if you consider this post selfinterest and off topic.
