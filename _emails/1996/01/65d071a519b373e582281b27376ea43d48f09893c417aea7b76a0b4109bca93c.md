  I have been reading this discussion, and I would recommend that someone 
show the time that Bruce Schneier has in his book "Applied Cryptography" 
(2nd ED), as he covers the security of different key lengths very well.  
I would also suggest that people read it if this is a topic that 
interests them, as it was written very well. 
  I would quote from it, except that I am at work, and the book is in my 
dorm room. :)
  Enjoy and have fun.
