Cypherpunks write code. With that phrase and the wave of attempts to 
censor the 'Net, I've embarked on a quest to make remailers easier to use.

Has anyone written an easy to use Windows or DOS application that will let
someone chain a message through several remailers, perhaps with support
for the mailer at alpha.c2.org? 

Would the writer of such a program, if in the US fall under the provisions
in ITAR? Obviously, calls to the PGP program would have to be made. I
recall reading that such hooks do fall under the ITAR. If this is true, so
much for a more user friendly version of chain for the masses.
