Playing around online today, it occured to me that much of Compu$pend's 
subscribers (and many other ISPs, especially smaller ones which might be 
subject to governmental pressures) rely largely on people who use chat 
modes frequently, often for sex-related chat... they cannot cut off IRC 
(for example) without hurting their income substantially.

If someone put up an IRC<->news gateway, with a bot that allowed anyone 
on channel to read newsgroups, it'd be virtually impossible to censor; 
one could use a variable channel name to increase the difficulty of 
censoring it.

Has anyone done this before? Or talked about it?
