I agree with Charlie Merritt and Declan that a well-placed FOIA
request would be a good thing (tm). I am less interested in the
identities of low-level Customs, etc. employees than I am in what
orders were given, and which political appointees gave them. This
action is an entirely reasonable one to take with regard to *our*
employees. As a FOIA request can get a bit expensive, I'd suggest
that those of us who are interested try to pool our efforts/$ as
we did with the ZLDF. This method seems to have worked, :) and
ecash should make it easy...
