Just remember you brought this up...

Not all of us even write code. Some of us write (horrors!) books! Yes, my
brethren, I earn my pay as a lowly scribe. Do I code? Nope. Am I a
Cypherpunk? Christ, I don't care. I'm on this mailing list; that works fine
for me. My brain expands almost daily from contact with such seditious sods.
Do I contribute to the health and growth of this list? Maybe. Do I preach
the Cypherpunk doctrine through my work at my company? Definitely. 

Just thought I'd point out that we aren't all code-monkeys. (And I mean that
in the best sense of the word.)
