Cypherpunks isn't the right place to discuss this in detail, but...

Efficiency != Cheap
Kerosene is cheap.  Steel fuel tanks and rocket motors are quite cheap.
Making big dumb rockets is well understood.  However, aircraft integration
is not.  If you use an 'off-the-shelf' aircraft, it has a human in it.
That means the whole thing must be safe.  If you don't, you have a drone
aircraft which isn't cheap at all.  Remember, the cost of materials
scales linearly with size.  The cost of a complex system scales as the
square of the parts count.

These arguments are hashed out (admittedly without consensus) regularly
in the sci.space newsgroups.
