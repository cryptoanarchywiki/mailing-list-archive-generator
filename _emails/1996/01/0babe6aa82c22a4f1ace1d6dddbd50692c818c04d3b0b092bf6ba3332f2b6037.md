This is a hard problem.  The only way I can see to do this is to
require interaction with the CA (or its proxy) for each signature.
The good news is that if you're doing certificate revokation lists
online, then there is probably already some interaction with the
server to verify that a certificate is still valid, before it is
accepted.

The trick here is to flip around who has to check the CRL server.

a.   Bob forms
     D = document he wants signed,
     ID_B = Bob's ID,
and sends to Alice
     M_0 = ID_B, D.

b.   Alice forms
     T = timestamp
and sends to the Server
     M_1 = T, hash(ID_B, D), Sign_{SK_A}(T, hash(ID_B, D)).

c.   The Server verifies the timestamp, the signature, and that
Alice is currently allowed to sign things (her certificate is valid
and hasn't been overused today).  If not, it drops the connection
and ends the protocol.  If things all check out, however, it forms
     M_2 = T, Sign{SK_S}(T, hash(ID_B, D), Certificate_A).

d.   Alice now has (until the timestamp T becomes too stale) an
authorization to sign D.  She does so, and sends to Bob (who's been
waiting all this time)
     M_3 = T, ID_B, D, Certificate_A, M_2, Sign_{SK_A}(ID_B, D).

Now, the trick is to redefine valid signatures as only those that
look like M_3.  The recipient has to verify the timestamp, and that
he hasn't received an identical signature from Alice recently, and
has to verify the two signatures.

(I make no promises about the soundness of this protocol--it's meant
to illustrate the idea, not to be used directly.)

Other than that, I can't think of anything that will fit the bill.
