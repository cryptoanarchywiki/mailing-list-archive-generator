I count numbers 1, 2 and 3 as one way (Trojan Horse).

If you can break in that far, I can think of much more imaginative  
things to do with the access.

Again, 4 and 5 are the same as 1,2 and 3.  (I thought I smelled  
horse biscuits.)

Insultingly obvious.

Yes.  Trojan Horse.  Whinny. Neigh.

Ahh, finally something other than a Trojan Horse attack, but it  
only affects sites with poor security.  In that case, this attack is  
the least of their problems.

Wow, a whole three different attacks and most of them much more  
useful for things other than gathering credit card numbers.

It's sad to think that a lot of people may actually believe this  
crap.  Let's just hope that enough technical users provide rebuttals  
in the other fora where this stuff appears.
