I think it was a very special reason, $5 million by some accounts.

Given the govt. internal needs it is not unreasonable to supply them with 
the equipment they need. The problem is in the forcing of non governmental
personnel to use them.

There are an awfully large number of people on cypherpunks who have taken
money from the NSA in some form or another. About 5 ft from my office is the old 
CIA safe from the days they had an office in this building.

The US govt does not believe in socialist subsidies to industy. It beleives in 
corporativist subsidies in inflated military contracts. Boeing got them to build 
the 747 and now its time for Netscape to get their handout. If this upsets people 
I'd just like to point out that the farming lobby is even worse, taking those 
snouts out of the trough is long overdue in almost every industrialised country.
