To play Sternlight's Advocate for the moment, I'll have to disagree 
with you here.  40-bit encryption really is a joke, for any business data
worth protecting (and Lotus Notes is primarily a business product.)
64-bit RC4 encryption, while less than ideal, is still usable
for most applications; it's certainly stronger than DES by a couple
orders of magnitude, which is probably enough for now.
Yes, the Yanquis can wiretap you, but it's better than having
_everybody_ wiretap you.  (And besides, you're probably going to
use the 128-bit smuggled version anyway.)  This at least provides
a product you can use with _some_ credibility, assuming it
interoperates with the US version, which I think the 40-bit version did.

The French can still ban it, or require you to register your keys,
just as they can with the 40-bit version.  Or ban products with
menu items in English, if they think that's too encrypted for them. :-)
C'est la guerre.
