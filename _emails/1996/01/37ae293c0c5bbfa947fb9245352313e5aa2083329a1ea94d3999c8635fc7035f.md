Well, there is software for encrypting IP datagrams. There may be PPP
encryption out there, since there is now an IETF protocol for doing
link encryption for PPP, but I don't follow PPP very closely.

I suspect not, but on the other hand hardware to do this sort of thing
is available. The TIS people packaged up swIPe with a 3DES board for
some applications a while back, just as an example of concept.

Hard to say. Depends on the implementation, your link characteristics,
etc.
