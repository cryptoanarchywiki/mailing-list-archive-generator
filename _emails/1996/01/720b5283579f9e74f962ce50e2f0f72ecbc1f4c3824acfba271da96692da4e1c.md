No one has accused the Wiesenthalistas of genocide.  We simply
want a free Net where all forms of hate, including the particular
flavor espoused by the Wiesenthalistas, may compete on a
Darwinian basis.

There is no need to support the tilting of the playing field by a
small number of extremists, who represent neither the perspective
of the public nor of most members of the Jewish faith.

I personally don't plan to waste my time reading any of the
aforementioned hate literature on the Net, and I care not at all 
whether it was authored by Whitopians, Zionists, Christers, or
Ufologists.
