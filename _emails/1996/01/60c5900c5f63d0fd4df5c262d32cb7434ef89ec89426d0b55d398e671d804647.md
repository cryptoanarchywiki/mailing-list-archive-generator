I think the only reason why the NSA has been getting away with this garbage
is because they convinced others that challenging the party line will
destroy you.

 I also think that they are bluffing. It is time that some party with
financial resources and public credibility makes a test case out of
themselves. An educational institution would be suited best.

Any takers?
