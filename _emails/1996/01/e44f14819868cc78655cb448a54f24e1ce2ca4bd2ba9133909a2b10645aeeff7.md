I don't agree that the market is different than the people.

And I hope that Information Freedom doesn't become as trivialized, 
trendy, and the property of dilletantes as the red-ribbon AIDS shtick.

There is a danger to holding up the AIDS hullabaloo as a role model. To
wit, the AIDS activists have committed themselves to a lie - that AIDS is
an epidemic, a generalized threat to society. They are riding a tiger by
the tail, for when the actual facts seep into the consciousness of the
unwashed masses - which might never really happen, given the reality of
our "whoever puts out their press release first, gets awarded the
Conventional Wisdom seal-of-approval" journalism - then the
AIDS-industrial complex is going to be in trouble. 

So, on with the paperclips - only, let's make sure that no Hollywood
celebrities are allowed to participate. It's the kiss of death....
