I picked this link up from the Fringewear list.  It has some interesting
information for quelling rumors and starting new ones.

ftp://ftp.ora.com/pub/examples/windows/win95.update/regwiz.html

The author takes the registration Wizard in Win95 apart and shows exactly
what it does and what it looks for.  Some interesting information about the
encrypted database of product information it uses.

It has a complete list of all of the products that the registration looks
for.  (PGP is not one of them.)  Some interesting facts about what it does
look for however...
