Phil Rogaway gave a great talk at RSADSC about keyed hashing MACs. In all he
described 12 different MACs (some of them variations on a theme), and gave
some efficiency/security tradeoff numbers relative to the security of the
underlying hash function. 

Apparently he had a paper in Crypto `95 about
bucket hashing, which is generally fast and simple and apparently pretty
secure. The idea is to place each word of the message into a unique fixed-size
subset of a large set of buckets, XOR each bucket internally, then concatenate
the results. I haven't yet read the paper (though I expect to do so soon), so
I don't know all the details. I think the notion is that you can plug in any 
pseudo-random function to select the buckets, and get provably good security 
if you know your function is suitably pseudo-random.

Check:

which has a link to his slides from last week, and

http://wwwcsif.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/list.html

which has links to a heap of papers, including the full version of the
Crypto `95 bucket hashing one.
