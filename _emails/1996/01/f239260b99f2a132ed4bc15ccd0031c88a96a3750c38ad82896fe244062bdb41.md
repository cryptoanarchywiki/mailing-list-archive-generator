Sorry!   I forgot to mention that the meeting is held
from 12 noon to 6 p.m.

	      Date:  Saturday January 13
	      Time:  12 noon - 6 p.m.
  	  Location:  Building 21, Sparcy's cafeteria, Sun Microsystems
	    Agenda:  YOUR NAME HERE!  (hint hint) 
	      Food:  Bagels provided.  Feel free to bring lunch to munch.
	Directions:  Take 101 to Amphitheater Parkway.   At the 
		     end of the exit ramp, turn left at the light
		     onto Charleston.   (This street is also known
		     as Garcia.)   After about 1/3 mile, turn right
		     onto the side street.  This will be the first
		     city side street on your right, as you drive
		     down Charleston/Garcia.  In about 2 or 3 blocks,
		     you'll see purple signs for Building 21 of Sun.

If anyone driving down from SF or Berkeley can pick up Ian at the SF airport
that would be way groovy.
