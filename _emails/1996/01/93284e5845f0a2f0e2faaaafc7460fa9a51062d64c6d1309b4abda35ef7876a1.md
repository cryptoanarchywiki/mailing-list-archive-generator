I don't think that's what was intended. If I understood:

There'd be a document (hereinafter PoA) signed by Helen which would
say "This is a PoA appointing Dave, PGP key X fingerprint Y, to
do A, B, C on my behalf #include<lawyerspeak.h>".

Then, when signing, Dave would sign with his own key X, making sure
that every document has "p.p. Helen" at the end. The recipient checks
Dave's signature on the document and Helen's signature on the PoA.

> Huh? Why? Why would you need [a separate key]? ...

Many automatic systems will assume that a key can only sign for 
one person (though each person may have several keys). Therefore,
it'll confuse "Dave" and "pp. Helen". The RISKS are obvious.

To avoid such confusion, Dave should create a separate key with 
the key ID "Dave pp. Helen" (or similar). However, Helen doesn't need
to (shouldn't) know that key! This is Dave's key, created by Dave
for Dave's use while he is agent for Helen. Helen would probably
sign this key, but doesn't need to since the PoA has the f'print.

In fact, you don't want Helen to know it, so that if Dave oversteps
his authority she can prove that it was him not her. Ie if Helen finds
out the key, Dave should revoke it.


Hope that makes sense...
