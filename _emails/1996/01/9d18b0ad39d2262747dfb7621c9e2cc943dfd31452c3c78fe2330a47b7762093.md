Are there any simple but crypto-strong hash functions?
I've been thinking about doing a "One Page Privacy" program,
using the 3-line RSA, 10-line RC4, and some glue,
but using a separate MD5 program seemed like cheating
(even though the 3-line RSA uses dc :-).  
I was thinking about using RC4 in some feedback mode as a MAC,
but it sounds like that's not secure enough?  Is there anything
else that's short?  MD5 requires too much code.
