Agreed.  I'll not be posting further on this topic here.  If you'd
care to pursue this E-mail, I have no objection.

If so, then they have the power to make that decision, and to
(largely) enforce it.  By doing so, however, they would (and should)
lose all the benefits of the internet as well.

I would argue that ANY country which actively tries to restrict
information providers in other countries through these "long arm of
the law" tactics, ought to be banished from the internet. 

If France wants to outlaw postings in English, I have no legitimate
right to complain -- so long as they limit it to postings from France.
If they were to begin arresting those from England, or Canada, or the
US, however, for posting in English, they would have gone too far.

Attempting to limit what comes into your country via filtering,
restrictions on your own carriers, prosecution of your own citizens or
other residents of your country for violations of your own laws, etc.
is one thing.  Trying to apply your laws to those in other countries,
however, is quite another.

Developing tools to access information is worthwhile.  But successfull
attacks on those providing information makes access tools worthless.
If the information simply isn't there, all the nice access tools in
the world can't create it.
