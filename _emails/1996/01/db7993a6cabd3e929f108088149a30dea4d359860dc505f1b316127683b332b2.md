The German company is CE Infosys -- and they make a PCMCIA DES card also, BTW.
The PC card is a decent performer but I haven't tested speed (of the interface)
for the PCMCIA card.

The code driving the card was written in Glenwood MD.  The Gauntlet
uses normal SWIPE protocol.  It can not be exported at this time.

However, there is a plan afoot at TIS to produce a version of Gauntlet
with full 56-bit DES SWIPE -- but with TIS CKE added to the communication
stream and therefore making the product exportable.

For more information, you can check TIS's web page www.tis.com
