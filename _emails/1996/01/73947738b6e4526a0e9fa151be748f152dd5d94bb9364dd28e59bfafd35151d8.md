Dear Mr. Dubois,

  Thank you for your efforts on the behalf of Phil Zimmermann.  You are to
be praised.  However, you should recognize that at best, all you have done
is to reduce the harm done to him (or would otherwise have been done to
him), which admittedly is a good and right thing for you to have done.

However, I refer you to the 1964 movie, "Dr. Strangelove," whose title
character stated that "deterrence is the art of making the enemy FEAR to
attack."

In my opinion, we (the ordinary members of the public) cannot consider
ourselves to have won this encounter until the REAL enemy here, the
government employees who targeted Zimmermann, FEAR to attack ("legally" or
otherwise) people like Zimmermann.  

Ask Mr. Zimmerman about my essay, or I'd be happy to email it to you.
Sadly, he did not appreciate its simplicity and potential effectiveness, and
maybe you won't either, but someday it may protect your freedom in ways you
can't currently even imagine.

Jim Bell
