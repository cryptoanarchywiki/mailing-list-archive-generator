   If you do this, you'll find out very quickly just how empty (or at
least how slippery) slogans like "the Internet routes around censorship"
are: if your efforts pay off and you steer even a fraction of CIS's
traffic toward the remaining open newsservers, they'll close faster than
you can say "alt." So before you do it, think about how the net will route
around sysops closing their servers off from the net.
