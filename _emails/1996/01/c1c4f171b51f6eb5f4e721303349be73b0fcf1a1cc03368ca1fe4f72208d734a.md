Network Security:  
Software scans E-mail gateways for virus threats

-- by Jessica Davis

The increasing number of links between LANs and the internet has
raised security concerns on private networks.

To address this issue, Central House Technologies Inc. has
acquired the North American rights to MimeSweeper Internet mail
virus-protection sofware from Integralis Ltd., in Berkshire,
England. 

[...]

The Windows NT server application works by unbundling and
unzipping messages at the gateway and returning the attached
documents to their original file format.  Then MimeSweeper uses a
virus-checking utility installed by the customer to examine the
attachments.

Upon receipt of a suspect attachment, MimeSweeper notifies the
postmaster and quarantines the message until the administrator
can take action.

[...]

Integralis also plans to add the capability to scan outgoing
documents for confidential information and add corporate
disclaimers to outgoing mail.

Integralis is also working on support for public key encryption
to allow encrypted messages to enter private networks without
delays from quarantines.
