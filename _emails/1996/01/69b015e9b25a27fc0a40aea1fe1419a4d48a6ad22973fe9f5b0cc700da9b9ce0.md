Clearly.

I keep hearing references to weaknesses in kerberos, which I more or less 
rely on. What are the problems I should be worrying about? Preferably as 
URLs.

Also, we have a new kerberos implementation for Macs that we're going to 
roll out soon. I'll see if the project manager would be willing to let 
other people take a look at it.
