In speaking with an associate, he mentioned in passing that PGP had 
been broken a few weeks ago in San Diego by the DoD using a Cray.  
All questioning about said subject was ended immediately as he felt 
that he might have said too much how it was.  Was PGP "broken"?

His background:  Prez of a firm with offices in D.C. & Silicon 
Valley.  He is a former Thunderbird pilot, and so has some 
connections in the military.  He has designed many hardware 
encrypting configurations using the VLSI007 chip as well as other 
chips that I am not familiar with.  One of his present projects is
designing a hardware encryption layout for Apple. 

Could this be part of the reason the charges were dropped against 
Phil as well?
