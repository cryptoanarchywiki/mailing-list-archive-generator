What I've found are a lot of files which are sitting in directories. I'm
not sure I have the terminology down perfectly, but the Alta Vista search
reveals a link, I click on it, and I'm in the fairly common "Web access to
a file system" situation, where I can click on files, directories, move up
and down the directory structure, etc. The files are not "Web documents" in
the sense of having been prepared for the Web (with fancy fonts, pictures,
etc.), but they are certainly fully accessible via the Web.
