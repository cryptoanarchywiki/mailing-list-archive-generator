Isn't this attacking, or at least opposing, them directly?

	Nope; its changing the terms of the debate.  Saying 'you can't
make this happen' is attacking them.

=09This is known as the "[S]he asked for it" argument, a widely
discredited defense.  If their _behavior_ doesn't indicate criminal
behavior, and there isn't a report of a crime with suspects meeting
their descriptions, there is no more excuse for hassling them than there
is for hassling blacks, or hispanics, or....  Who knows, they could
actually be a bunch of Marines (depending on the area).

	No, this is not 'she asked for it.'

	If there are skinheads who fit the description 'bald, black
leather, swastikas' attacking people, then stopping people who fit
that description is ok by me, as opposed to stopping people who fit
the description 'black, medium hight, living in Boston,' which were
the criterion here a few years back after Chuck Stewart shot his wife.

	The lead-in was people being attacked on the street at random.
I thought I had hypothosized that they were skinheads.

	The crypto relevance might be getting thin.  I think this will
end my contribution to this thread in public.
