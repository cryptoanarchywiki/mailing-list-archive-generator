I think Tim was referring to someone gleaning your private key, which would 
be a Disastrous Thing (tm). If that's not what he was referring to, I still 
think it's a possiblity.

     I gather that it would be a Bad Thing (TM) to have someone get both 
     the encrypted and clear text forms of your message (from either you or 
     from the recipient)
     
     Maybe regularly changing your encryption keys is a Good Thing (TM)
