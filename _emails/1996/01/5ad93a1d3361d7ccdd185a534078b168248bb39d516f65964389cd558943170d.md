I would like to announce that from all of the mail I've received 
about the egg question, Tim receives the special award for the best 
answer.

I would like to say though that at the time I was in Ottawa, it was 
right during the Quebec Referendum vote.  Making a joke about the 
French (i.e. Parisian eggs) could have stuck me in a little room with 
a customs officer for much, much longer.  Who knows, maybe I was a 
French Canadian spy!!!

hmmmm....
