Tell that to folks in the contries of used-to-be-Russia.  Lots of old 
Communist leaders getting back into power - some folks are even saying 
that the old days under the Communists were better than living in a free 
market economy.

Never underestimate the value of human stupidity and shortsightedness.

How about on the backbone itself?  Since everyone goes through the htree 
major backbones, all one would have to do is control access at those 
points.  Of course, that would lead to clandestine use of 
store-and-forward LEOsats, s&f UUCP sites, etc.  UUCP might even make a 
comeback ;)
