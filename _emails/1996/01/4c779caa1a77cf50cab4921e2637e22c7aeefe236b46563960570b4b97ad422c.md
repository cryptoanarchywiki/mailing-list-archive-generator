# The problem, as I see it, is that you can have too much information. 
# Information takes up room, takes up CPU cycles to process and store and
# retrieve, and the worst part is, it takes a human to evaluate it.  No
# computer in the world is going to be able to evaluate incoming humint for
# reliability.  That takes a human, and I suspect that it will be that way
# for quite some time.  The more information you gather, the worse the
# problem gets, until you have this massive database of information, all
# indexed and stuff, at your fingertips, but it's useless, because you can't
# tell whether it's real or BS or disinformation. 

It's how you classify things.  Raw data is raw data, and raw data is not the
same thing as information.  Until the disinformation gets filtered out, it can't
be classified as information, but falls into the raw-data category.
