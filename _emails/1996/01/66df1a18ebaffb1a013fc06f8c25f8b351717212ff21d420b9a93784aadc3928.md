The Lotus `solution' seems to be the action of an American company
shipping a product which effectively says to foreign users, "We don't
care about you as a market." That this is the so-called "export"
version is ironic. The keys are escrowed with the U.S. government,
and no one else. The French government should rightly cry foul, for
this is (a) encryption where they don't have the keys and (b) encryption
where another government *does*.

For the world where industrial espionage is supposed to be becoming
the top priority and  where there have already been ugly accusations among
teams at trade talks, the NSA has just scored a victory on two fronts.

They've forced a major company (they don't come much more major than IBM)
to ship a product which actually helps them in both aspects of their
mandate. Communications interception of foreign industries' groupware
is now easier for the U.S. than for any other country, while (and
this must be granted) the communications security of American
industries will be somewhat improved by this move.

This is a win for the NSA, whose mandate (much as their Canadian
counterpart) would appear to read:
	We help you make sure that no-one can read your e-mail, except us.

The sick thing is, Notes will probably *still* be the best choice,
despite these matters (compared to competition from other similar software,
and from the web). For all the `Notes is dead, long live the web'
talk, the web as I've used it lacks authentication and access control
beyond an all-or-none system. I'll go check w3.org again.
