I really don't know why I'm being "killed" by May in this way.  He cites a 
rant by a local (Portland, Oregon) crackpot named "Jack Hammer."  I even 
took the time to apologize for his existence, while I do claim a certain 
lack of responsibility:  Basically, I'm being targeted because Hammer can't 
stand my essay.  (Whether May will even see my apology is in doubt, I 
suppose...)  While May certainly has the right to "killfile" whomever he 
wishes, it might be a bit more logical to do this in a graduated fashion, 
"killing" Hammer and then waiting to see if the rest of us follow in his 
habits.
