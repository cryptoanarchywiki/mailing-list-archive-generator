Interestingly enough, my primary objection was NOT really commercial
encroachment on an existing amateur structure (though that is an important
consideration!); rather, it was the fact that because we're talking really
short-range communication (way less than a kilometer, in most cases) using
frequencies below a gigahertz would be a counter-productive shame.  Here, we
WANT "line of sight"!  And, of course, the bandwidth issue is inherently
better:  It would be FAR easier to get 100 MHz width at around 2.5 GHz than
under 1 gig!

I get a free (bingo-card) magazine industry magazine called "Microwaves and
RF," which is sort of the EDN for the high-frequency communication crowd.
You'd be amazed at the level of technical (chip) development there.  Chip
sets that do frequency synthesis/full RF/IF on surface mount chips.

(BTW, I use Eudora, and I have PGP.  Could somebody explain how to PGP-sign
messages, ideally EASILY?)
