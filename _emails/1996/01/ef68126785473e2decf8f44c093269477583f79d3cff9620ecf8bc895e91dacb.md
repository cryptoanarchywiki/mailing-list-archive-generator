You can give them accounts, but they are still covered by their secrecy 
oath, so they can't answer questions about what the grand jury did (at 
least in most jurisdictions, YMMV).   This got very contraversial in the 
Rocky Flats case, where the grand jurors hired a lawyer to get permission 
to go public to complain about a failure to prosecute.  

I don't recall ever reading about the outcome of that case, so I can't 
report the result.  If the jurors had won, I would have expected to hear 
about it.  It may still be pending.
