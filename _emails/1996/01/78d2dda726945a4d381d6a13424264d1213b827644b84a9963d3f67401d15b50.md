Some of you must have missed the superbowl ads where people and frogs 
were getting frozen to beverage cans, and movie actors moved the grand 
canyon with a horse.  Marketing is a fact of life.  Seems to me the 
irresponsibile thing too many of our society do is put too much stock in 
the marketeers.  I usually select products on their merits, not on the 
marketing.  Maybe you do too.  But the marekting works, and companies 
have to use it to stay profitable.

So, what do you think of their product?
