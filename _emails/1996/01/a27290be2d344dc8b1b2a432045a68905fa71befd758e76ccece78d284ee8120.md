The 9th Circuit issued a ruling today in _Fonovisa v. Cherry Auction_
overturning an ED CA district court's ruling re vicarious liability for
copyright and trademark infringement. If I remember correctly, the lower
court's ruling was one of those relied upon by Judge Whyte in his recent
_Netcom_ ruling. In any event, it looks like it's an important development
in vicarious liability and thus liability for ISP's and remailers and other
providers of electronic "space" or conduit.
