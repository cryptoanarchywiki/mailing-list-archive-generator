  Subject: CAs and Digital Timestamping ]

At the RSA conference last week, it occurred to me that there's a
really neat application for digital timestamps (as done by Surety).
Whenever a CA (Certification Authority) issues a public key
certificate, it should also digitally timestamp it.  This provides a
relatively clean way to recover from top-level CA key compromises.

First of all, let's talk about hash trees.  A hash tree (I think the
idea was originated by Merkle, but I could be wrong) is a binary
tree.  Each node in the tree eventually winds up with a hash value
associated with it.  The bottom nodes on the tree are hashes of
individual messages.  The other nodes are made up of the hash of all
their children.  This looks like this:  (pardon the ASCII art)

:                               H_0 = hash(H_1,H_2)
:                          /                    \
:              H_1 = hash(H_3, H_4)        H_2 = hash(H_5,0)
:             /         \                     /         \
:    H_3 = hash(M_0)  H_4 = hash(M_1)  H_5= hash(M_2)     0
:
:

The neat thing about this is that, if I know H_0, then when someone
wants to verify that M_0 appears in the hash, they only have to tell
me H_4 and H_2, and the position of M_0 in the tree.  I can then
find H_3 = hash(M_0), H_1 = hash(H_3,H_4), and verify that the final
H_0 = hash(H_1, H_2) gives the right output value.  (Compare this
with a hashing chain, and you can see that, for large trees, there's
a big advantage here.  The number of values needed to authenticate a
given message in this tree is log_2(number of messages in the tree),
while the number of values to verify a chain is is the whole number
of messages in the chain.

In the digital timestamping service offered by Surety, they use hash
trees of this kind, because this allows efficient verification of a
digital timestamp.  The idea behind this is that a message is hashed
into the hash tree, and that the final value of the hash tree each
day or week is widely published, including in the New York Times. So
long as it's not feasible to go back and change that value, and it's
not possible to find collisions for the hash function, any hash
value that appears in that tree must have been presented to the
timestamping people at some point before that tree's final hash was
calculated.

Here's how we use this in having a CA sign certificates.

CA Signs a Key:

1.   At the beginning of the day, the CA generates a random value,
R_0, and has it digitally timestamped.  The resulting timestamp is
used as one of the entries in today's hash tree.  (If the CA is
their own digital timestamp service, then they'll have to use the
previous day's ending value, which is reasonable enough.  They'll
also have to work a lot harder to publish this value each day or
week.)

2.   For each certificate to be generated:

     a.   The CA verifies the information in Certificate_u, then
          signs it with SK_{CA}.  Certificate_u contains some
          indication of the time and date.

     b.   The CA hashes Certificate_u into its daily hash tree.

     c.   The CA sends Certificate_u to user u.

3.   At the end of the day, the CA publishes its own final hash tree
value, and gets this value digitally timestamped.  (This amounts to
having the CA act as its own "node." for the timestamping service.)

Now, imagine that the CA's key has been compromised.  (We have to
assume that the CA's daily operations were OK--if not, there doesn't
seem to be a clean way to recover cleanly.)  The person who has the
CA's key can issue false certificates.  After a while, one of these
false certificates are noticed.  How do we recover?

We use the hash trees and the digital timestamps which we've made in
the past to verify each certificate presented for recertification.
The digital timestamps allow us to immediately verify that this
certificate was issued by this CA at this time.  And we can be
certain that this hash tree is correct because it's been digitally
timestamped.

What this does, essentially, is to allow us to quickly recover from
key compromises.  We still have problems if someone can take over
the operations of our CA for a few days or weeks, though in that
case, we probably know the likely dates.  No compromise at the CA
can put a different date's timestamp on a certificate.

Now, I should note that I think Merkle talks about using hash trees
to do public key certificates, in his thesis, and the idea may be
patented.  (It's been a couple of years since I looked at his
thesis, so this is a little hazy.)  However, we're not using them
here to provide certificates--we're using them to authenticate the
certificates in the event of a catastrophic key compromise.  I don't
think Merkle talked about this, but I could be mistaken.  (At any
rate, I've never seen any mention of it since then, though it's an
obviously useful idea.)  If the tree structure is patented, then we
could still do this by using chains or some other structure.  Does
anyone know if this basic idea has been proposed before?  I am
pretty sure I haven't seen it, but it seems pretty obvious now that
I think about it.  We could even recover using this method from a
break of the hash function supported (so long as the timestamps are
done with multiple hash functions, and at least one isn't broken),
or the public key algorithm used.
