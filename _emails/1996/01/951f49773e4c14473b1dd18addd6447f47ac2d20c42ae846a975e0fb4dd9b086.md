About 10 years ago, I bought a Loran unit from Heath, and (due to my
association with some people who did laser photoplotting for PC boards) had
a program written which generated a "LAT/LON" map plastic overlay.  Apply
over a USGS 7.5 minute map, and you can read LAT/LON directly.  (It only
needed to be photoplotted once, of course:  positive contact printing
duplicated it easily.)

Only one problem:  Since the width of longitude changes with latitude, a
given map overlay can only be "exactly" accurate at one latitude. Still, it
made estimating LAT/LON FAR easier.
