I do not think that wether PZ or anybody else was prosecuted in *this* case means that ITAR does not have teeths.  The most important thing in order to understand a situation is to put yourself in the other guy's shoes.  If I would have been in the govt shoes, maybe I would have let down the case too.  It does not mean that I wouldn't attempt any case like this anymore...  Theses peoples are not stupid.  They might be statists, but they are intelligent statists...

PZ case could have been presented as borderline, and could have made a precedent not in their advantage.

Non-objectivity of a law never prevented the govt to "enforce" it.
