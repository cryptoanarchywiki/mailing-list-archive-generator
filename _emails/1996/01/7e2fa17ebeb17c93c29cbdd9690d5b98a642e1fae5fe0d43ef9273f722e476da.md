The NYT reports that by 2000 there will be over 1 million 
lawyers in the US.


These fine-minders, supported by the burgeoning private 
investigative and security fields, will surely mine electronic 
archives as thoroughly as they research paper -- and thanks to 
wondrous Altavistas maybe more thoroughly.


And backed by these highly skilled lobbyists, laws will change 
to make remunerative rain of -- and by -- archiving and search 
technology as they have to capitalize on the technology of 
doing the same in the worlds of printing, telegraph, telephone 
and television.


Promotion of these privacy-invasive services on the Net 
parallels the defensive measures explored on cypherpunks.


Perhaps all c'punks should subscribe to cyberia-l and vice 
versa; they are hand in hand, or fist to fist, on this.
