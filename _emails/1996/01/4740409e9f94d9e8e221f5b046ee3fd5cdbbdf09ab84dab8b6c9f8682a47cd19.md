The odd command line in the postscript file is specific to HP laserjet's.
It is a command that tells the printer to switch to postscript mode.  The
Microsoft print drivers are bad about this.  One option is to strip all
occurances of this line from the file or load and print the file from
GhostScript, a postscript processor.

Hope this helps.
