I think that has a bit to do with a question I had, whether it was SHA
and SHA-1 (aka "Revised SHA") but I've found the revised version being
referred to as "SHA-2" in a couple of sources and went with that....
unless there *is* a third revision...?!?

Problem is the memo I saw still referred to the revised algorithm as
SHA.  (Anyone have a URL for FIPS 180-1 Please...?)

Rob.
