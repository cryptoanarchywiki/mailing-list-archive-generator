The UK's Sunday Telegraph has today featured an article by Robin
Gedye entitled "Neo-Nazis are marching on the Internet" in which
apart the the usual nonsense about neo-Nazis being about to take
over the world by means of their "Thule Net" accuses the deviser
of PGP of being a Nazi sympathiser:

"Private communications between neo-Nazis on the network are
effected under a program called "Pretty Good Privacy", devised by
an American neo-Nazi sympathiser."

  Robin Gedye (in Bonn) p.23 of "The Sunday Telegraph" January 21,
  1996
