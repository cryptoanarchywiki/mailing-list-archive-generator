Could you explain how "enough people" can get around a basic
feature/limitation of the current PGP web of trust? Who, besides the
originator, can revoke an old key? How many does it take?

If a bunch of the "alleged" friends of Bruce could do this, could they not
revoke the key of someone they simply wish to hassle?

I agree that a new key can be generated, and a new "Please use this key,
not the other one" message sent, and this may work, but I don't believe
this revokes the old key and removes it from the keyservers. I could be
wrong, as I am certainly no expert on the keyservers.

The question is: is there a "majority vote" mode on the keyservers that
causes them to remove a key if enough people claim it is no longer valid?
