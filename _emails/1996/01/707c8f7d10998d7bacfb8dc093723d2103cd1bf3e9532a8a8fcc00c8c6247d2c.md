I think you have a very different view of rating than I do.  For example, I
would be comfortable rating all the Sesame Street shows for sex and
violence without seeing any more than I have seen, just based on the
reputation of the show's producers.  Based on reviews in the newspaper
(since the net has replaced TV for me), most of the current network shows
can also be rated for all their episodes.  Remember also, there is an
"unrated" catagory.  Some people will refuse to access unrated material. 
Others, (I suspect you and I) may seek it out.

One possible addition to search engines would be to give the people who
have actually viewed the video/web page etc. an opportunity to rate it on
any of several criteria including whether they thought it was worth their
time.  Other people could then use these ratings as they wanted (including
ignoring them).  The big problem I see would be making the system easy
enough to use to get a reasonable response.
