Still working through my 10MB cpunks mail backlog; this one's from 
November 17, 1995:

Aha, thanks for the elaboration. I was confused by your use of the term
"note" to describe something that isn't in fact worth money, when you said
"the potential payee could generate a "blinded" note to be delivered to the
payer". It also helps that I haven't read much of the ecash(tm :) protocol
