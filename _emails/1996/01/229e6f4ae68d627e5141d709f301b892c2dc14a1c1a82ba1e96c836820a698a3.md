*puzzled look* They don't?

And before I get totally off topic, on the subject of the Singaporean
government and their attitude to do-what-you-will liberalism (hah!),
just as a bit of noise, what sexual practices are illegal in Singapore?

Now that's *way* off topic, but what is there in the way of
enforcement for said regulations. More specifically, any info
generally on the whole Singapore law-enforcement system. Not of course
the public things, but it's intelligence stuff.

if AC is considered subversive... Mass media has had some interesting
articles about the Singapore govt being a little worried about being
either isolated or forced to abandon their vaunted censorship
role. Article itself was rubbish, but the idea behind it was interesting.
