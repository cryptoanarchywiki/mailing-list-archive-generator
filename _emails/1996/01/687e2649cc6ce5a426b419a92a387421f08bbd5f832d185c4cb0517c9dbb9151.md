You know, you all are worrying too much about this War of the Offending Words.   What the governing types are really trying to prevent is communication which is succinct, direct, penetrating, & to the point.

What needs to do is to learn to speak like politicians.  Learn to go around the subject, make indirect reference, make vague allusions, be indirect & wavering, ambiguous & obfuscating, evasive & hypocritical; never openly offending, never possible to be held liable for having said anything of consequence.

Of course it will still be annoying, but how can they criticize their own style & manner.

    ..
