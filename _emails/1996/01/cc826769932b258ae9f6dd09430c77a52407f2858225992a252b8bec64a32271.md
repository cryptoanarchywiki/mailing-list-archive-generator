Turns out the darn calendar on my computer goes ahead increments
the date field sometime right round midnight.    This is what I get
for inferring today's date by glancing at the calendar manager, and
"adding 1" for tomorrow.   

The cypherpunks meeting is on Saturday Jan 27. 

Sorry about that.
