All apologies accepted.

As to the "English lesson," I feel that proofreading messages to
1200+ people is more important than proofing private e-mail, but
some folks evidently disagree with me. For an example of posts
which I feel are properly proofed, please see Tim's posts. They
aren't perfect English (mine aren't either) but there's evidence
that he takes the time to proofread them. This not only makes
his posts easier to read, it makes them [IMO] more convincing.
Of course, I usually agree with Tim anyway. [Hi Tim] I'll shut
up now and resume lurking mode. Please e-mail me privately if
you feel the urge to comment on this distinctly non-cypherpunk
subject. TIA.
JMR
