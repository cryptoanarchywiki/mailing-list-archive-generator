Please note that the carrick demo that is available on www.encryption.com 
is just that; a DEMO.

As the documentation states, the file format is NOT what is in the full 
retail product.  The files that the demo generates are NOT compatible with 
the full retail version.

The demo is a marketing-driven effort.  The shipping version will have a 
different UI, a different file structure, a different file header, etc.

Azalea Software will make full source code available to those who wish to 
review carrick under nondisclosure agreement.  We have written an FAQ that 
details carrick's API's and file header.  It will answer many questions that 
some cryptographically sophisticated users may have.

We apologize for any misunderstanding or inconvenience the demo may have 
caused.  Again, the demo is a marketing piece to accompany the press release 
that we are distributing.  Ver 1.0 should be going out the door any day now 
and we invite all cypherpunks and other encryption fans to look it over.
