Hogwash. WINE isn't nearly finished, and DOSEMU won't run a lot. They 
certainly won't run the newer 32-bit applications that MS wrote to 
require DDE and other stuff.

Netscape does not give away its browser for free, or at least they don't
intend to. You're supposed to pay for it if you use it for anything other
than educational or non-profit org use (not non-commercial use -- for
personal non-commercial use, you're supposed to pay). Of course this 
isn't very tightly enforced.

Have you ever tried tech support?

Microsoft has never offered toll-free tech support as a matter of policy. 
You get a limited amount of support via a toll call to Redmond. Other 
companies are only a little better.

People still buy software, and a lot of it.

I agree that copyright is dying, or should die, but I am not convinced
that we have a solution.
