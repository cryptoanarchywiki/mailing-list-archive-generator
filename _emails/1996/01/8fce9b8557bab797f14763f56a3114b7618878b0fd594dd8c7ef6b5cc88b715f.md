This type of world government talk is a peculiarly US type of paranoia. 

It is clear that the people who indulge in this class of consipiracy theory do 
not believe in the US system of government, and consider it to be a failure. 
Hence the constant denigration of the political institutions, the belief that 
all institutions of government are inherently corrupt etc etc etc.

Sounds like the sort of people who should be pressing for the US to be taken 
under UN administration. After all the UNs major role is to replace governments 
where governance has failed.

A little known fact to bear in mind is that when the Treaty of Paris was signed 
the British signatory had his fingers crossed behind his back! The entire US 
constitution is thus invalid and the US is in reality still a part of the 
British Empire!
