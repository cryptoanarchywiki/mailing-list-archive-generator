Merchants might.  Current credit-card processing terminals are increadibly
overpriced for what you get.  $100.00 plus the price of an inexpensive PC, plus
proprietary software isn't too far of the mark, in comparison.

I've been a fan of unrelated encryption at each layer of the 7 (5, 4, whatever)
layers,  lateley.  In military/financial terms, the question of "who has access
to what" and "needs to know what" at different levels of the protocol stack
make a big difference.  Network guys should be able to perform traffic
analysis, application guys should be able to debug application-specific
traffic, but not visce versca.

If you think "Not _my_ credit cards, but my _customers'_...", then it starts to
make sense.
