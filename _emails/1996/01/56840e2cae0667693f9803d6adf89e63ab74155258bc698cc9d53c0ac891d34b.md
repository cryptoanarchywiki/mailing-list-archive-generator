But an IP provider doesn't have to know that it's "forwarding" *any*
newsgroups; all it has to know is that IP packets are moving between
my PC and the outside world.  It doesn't have any way of knowing what
those packets contain and doesn't want to.

The Internet is more than news, FTP, the web, and so on primarily
because it's so much *less*.
