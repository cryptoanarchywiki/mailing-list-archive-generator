It's an administrative nightmare.  I assume that you mean if the key 
is widley distributed.  If it's only circulating among a small group 
of people that know each other, no problem.  

If it's widley distributed, or on a keyserver, that becomes hard.  
First you would have to be authenticated as the origional key owner, 
ie how do I realy know that you are you, and not somebody saying you 
are the orgional key owner?

Another problem, let's say I get your public key from Bob, who signed 
your key, and Bob knows you have revoked your key, but I don't, so 
what happens to my copy of your key? 

Since there is no revokation certificate, I am forced to take Bob's 
word that you have indeed want to revoke your key, but have no way of 
verifying that without talking to you, and agin I have to go through 
the same verification process that Bob did.

Good topic.
