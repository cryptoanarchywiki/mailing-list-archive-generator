Since the German Government (or the local "DA" who is claiming to represent
the National Government <g>) is talking about delivery of banned items in
Germany, I think that the relevant location is the node that is being used
not where the other end of the call to that node is located. What is being
requested is that CIS refrain for delivering the stuff to the Nodes in
Germany (they are not being told to monitor someone in Germany who is
trying to get it by calling LD to a node in France (or the US for that
matter).
