I haven't checked my logs for Alta Vista but many of the spiders do follow the robot exclusion standard. A simple text file that should be retrieved first by any spider that explains where one may not go.

The standard is fully explained at:

But this does nothing for those items sitting in more traditional public space. Obscurity is no longer security.
