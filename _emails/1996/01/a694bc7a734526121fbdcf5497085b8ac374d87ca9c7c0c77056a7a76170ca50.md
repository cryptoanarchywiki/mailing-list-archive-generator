   I think what is going to happen is that Qualcomm will choose S/MIME
instead of PGP, since they are one of the companies listed as jumping on the
band wagon.  

   S/MIME scares me since I believe it to (normally) use weak encryption.
It is gaining in popularity and hype and might be just the product to lull
mass amounts of users into using weak crypto (read government readable).
Microsoft, Banyan, ConnectSoft, Frontier Technologies, Network Computing
Devices, FTP Software, Wollongong, SecureWare Lotus, and others are on the
band wagon as well. 

   From section 2.2 of the S/MIME Implementation Guide published by RSA
   "... U.S. software manufactures have been compelled to incorporate an
   "exportable" content encryption algorithm in order to create a widely
   exportable versions of their product.  "

   "... For outgoing messages, RC2 CBC at 40 bits is the recommended default.
   stronger content encryption is strongly recommended where there is some
   mechanism to indicate that the intended recipient(s) can support it.

   Even though S/MIME allows for any bulk encryption scheme to be used, all
I ever see advertised is DES.  Most companies, including Qualcomm who depend
on government agencies to give them licenses (like FCC dudes), will bend
like a reed in the wind when under pressure.  Follow the money.
