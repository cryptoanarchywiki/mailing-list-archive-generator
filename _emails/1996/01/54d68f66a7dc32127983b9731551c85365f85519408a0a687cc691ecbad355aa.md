	oh, I do not think so --I would answer you in private mail if you 
    were not afraid to state a Reply-To address.  history is a 
    fascinating study in continual revisionism --to the victor goes the 
    right to rewrite history, or:

	I do not fear history, I intend to write it.
		--Winston Churchill

    	I could have stated my position much clearer: this particular demand
    is based on the same hysteria as has been found throughout history;
    and, see my other comments elsewhere. 

    As to anonyminity, I remain,
