Very true. Up here (Canada), we have _much_ less of the "use the courts as a
weapon of harrassment" phenomenon. But, I don't believe we have a (much)
lower percentage of lawyers than you do.

It's part of the mindset. Somehow, over the course of several generations,
you folks have become an entirely too litigious lot for your own good. The
result is was PRZ just came through and the multitude of cases that the
Church of Sceintology is involved in.

How to fix it? Beats me. However, I think it will probably have to start
with the judiciary. Justices from all levels of your court system will have
to put their collective feet down and stop allowing this kind of nonsense. I
don't know enough about the inner workings of the legal systems to know if
this would be all that's needed. Perhaps some new legislation would also be
required.

Whatever happens, it can only be for the better. In the meantime, could you
get your damn lawyers off my tv? ;-) We don't let our lawyers do that.
They've only been able to advertise at all in the last 10 years or so.
