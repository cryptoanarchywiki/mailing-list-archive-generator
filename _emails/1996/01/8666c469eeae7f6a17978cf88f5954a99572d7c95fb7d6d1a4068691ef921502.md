Not only DOS suffers from this problem. The MacOS does as well. All 'wipe
unused space' utilities for the Mac fail on a typical hard drive to
overwrite several hundred kB of data. Few people seem to care that the OS
fills the unused parts of the last block of a file with whatever happens to
be in the buffer.
