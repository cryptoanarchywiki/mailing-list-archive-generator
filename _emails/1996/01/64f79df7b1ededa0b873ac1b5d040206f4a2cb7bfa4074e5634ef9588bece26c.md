Netcom has not removed access to the alt groups, but they have
definitely screwed something up in the news system for the shell
machines.  Netcruiser accounts seem to work fine.

I just tried a test post to a bunch of alt.sex groups from Netcom
shell and it bounced instantly with the obnoxious message.

/usr/lib/newsbin/inject/injnews:alt.sex.girl.watchers,
alt.sex.graphics,alt.sex.hello-kitty,alt.sex.homosexual,
alt.sex.incest,alt.sex.intergen,alt.sex.magazines,
alt.sex.masturbation,alt.sex.pedophile.mike-labbe:
no groups in active file

/usr/lib/newsbin/inject/injnews: article in /u1/mpd/dead.article

/usr/lib/news/inews failed

Given Netcom's superb reputation for protecting free speech, It
is very unlikely this has anything to do with censorship.
Possibly someone encountered this glitch while trying to access
an alt group and jumped to conclusions.

Then again, maybe the Bavarians are running Netcom now. :)
