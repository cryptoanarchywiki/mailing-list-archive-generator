I'm not on the list just now, my work won't allow me the time to follow it.
I'm still just as interested in cryptography though, and would like
y'all to email me recommendations on good math books that will give me
the background to understand the papers in the field.  I'm sure that will
include a good numbers theory text.  If a beginner at number theory
would have a hard time understanding it, please recommend background
texts as well:)  What else would I need?  My computer science texts
explain complexity theory well, what would I need in information theory.
What would I have to read to understand factoring complexity?  Are there
any new texts that cover the recent breakthroughs in factoring?

Thanks:)
