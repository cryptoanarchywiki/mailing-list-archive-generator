"Logically" works for "criminals" too.  A drug dealer of any significance 
should never talk about business on the phone.  Yet there are countless 
consensually monitored or tapped conversations in which someone says "we 
really shouldn't talk over the phone, but the shipment will be in Tuesday 
at 3:00.  Have the $$$ ready."
