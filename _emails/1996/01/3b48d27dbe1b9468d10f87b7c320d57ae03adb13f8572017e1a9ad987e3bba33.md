I have no idea how Lotus actually does this, but:

How about a salt determined by the forty bit part?

Ie if the key is s.g (s=secret, g=gaked), the BARF (="Big-brother Access
Required Field") could contain Encrypt(Hash(s).g,BigBrother).

The receiving end, knowing both s and g, could re-calculate the
BARF and only function when it's correct. Unless it's been hacked too,
in which case it could barf when the BARF is correct :-)


Would that work or have I missed something? As I said, I've no idea
what Lotus actually does.
