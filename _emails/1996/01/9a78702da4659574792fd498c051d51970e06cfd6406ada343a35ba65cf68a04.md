Many cypherpunks might enjoy programming in XLISP 2.1h because the freely
available implementation of LISP now offers support for BIGNUMS. That means
it is quite easy to write cryptographic algorithms that use very large
numbers without adding extra support. The downside is that the language is
interpretted and thus much slower than something like C.

It should also be possible to write RSA in a very short XLISP program. I
don't know if you can do 4 lines, but it should be quite short.
