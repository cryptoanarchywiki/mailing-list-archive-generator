I think Stephen Albert was asking about the possibility of using logs to find
out what he's reading, not posting. That's quite possible. Recall the recent
incident when an unethical researcher looked through his colleagues' .newsrc
files to see what newsgroups they were subscribed to.

If this concerns you, perhaps you could use something like an anonymous HTTP
proxy to connect "really anonymously" to an NNTP server?
