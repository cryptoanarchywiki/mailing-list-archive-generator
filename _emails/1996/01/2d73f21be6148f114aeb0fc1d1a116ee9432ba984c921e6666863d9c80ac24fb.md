   An FT reviewer of the KDM/TSU books writes that "Littman
   reveals how little divides the sheriffs of cyberspace from
   its outlaws. Shimomura resembles Mitnick more than he
   would like to admit. The big difference is that the
   computer expert on the right side of the law becomes a
   media celebrity, earns consultancy fees telling companies
   how to defend themselves, and has others pay his expenses
   and buy his equipment. The expert who does not inhabits
   a prison cell with six other men, and is reduced to
   writing pleas for help with a stub pencil."
