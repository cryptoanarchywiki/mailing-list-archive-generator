   Here's Littman on immunity for Shimomura (describing telco
   tracking Mitnick):

   Shimomura's brought along his own hacker's scanning rig.
   It's pretty basic, just an Oki 900 cellular phone and a
   hardware interface to his tiny HP Palmtop. One of
   Shimomura's friends -- who happens to be under federal
   indictment for illegal hacking -- cooked up the interface
   and helped write the software.

   Shimomura likes his computer-controlled cellular phone, but
   its use for tracking is limited. Its main purpose is to
   lock on a call and eavesdrop. It is illegal to use it to
   eavesdrop on calls. That's why Shimomura needed immunity
   from prosecution when he demonstrated his Oki scanner
   before Congress a couple of years ago. (p. 6)
