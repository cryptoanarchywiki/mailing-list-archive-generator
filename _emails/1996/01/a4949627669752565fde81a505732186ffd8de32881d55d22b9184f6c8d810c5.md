Once the Ecash Mint and the account (in our case the WorldCurrency
Access account - others will be different) are merged, the balance
you hold in the Mint may be able to earn interest.  Like an
individual, the amount of interest offered  will involve a cost benefit 
relationship based on cost of funds, regulation,  and operational 
costs, but there should be no obvious reason not to pay something 
in most curencies.

One note, under US banking regulation, "transaction accounts" fall
under different rules than money market accounts, savings accounts,
and NOW accounts.  Depending on the exact functionality desired, 
and future regulation changes, there will be more or less incentive
and/or legal ability to pay interest.

Given the current functionality of Ecash there will be little 
incentive to hold balances on your hard drive once interest is
available.  It is just too easy to move the money down when
you need it.  Today there is no specific cost incentive between 
the Mint and your hard drive.

It does not take a long leap to see that when the account and the
Mint are merged, that since the Mint _is_ the account, PC/Internet 
banking, debit and all other regular banking functionality can
become immediately integrated!
