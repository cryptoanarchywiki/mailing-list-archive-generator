   1-28-96. NYT:

   A "Viewpoint" article not on the NYT Web site:

   "Standoff in Cyberspace Gulch," by a Yankelovich author of
   the recent Cybercitizen Survey, reports on the showdown
   shaping up as the law moves into cyberspace, highlighting
   the clash between citizen fears about security and the
   desire for privacy, with stats from Yankelovich polls.

      The quandary here -- that regulations are both thought
      to be needed, yet anticipated to fail -- is the biggest
      issue, and one that puts additional pressure on the
      limits of cyberspace privacy. This crisis of confidence,
      as much as lawlessness itself, could easily choke the
      growth of cyberspace.
