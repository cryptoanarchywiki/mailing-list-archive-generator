I see two possible ways to censor German users only (but I still believe
censoring anyone is wrong).  First, the "main computers" could be told where
they are, and "censored" material could be filtered at that level before it
is sent to individual users.  Or CompuServe could release a software update
for German users.  The software would not recognize banned newsgroups.  How
difficult could that possibly be?
