Not only does it prevent the nasties from logging where you're coming 
from, but it also translates to Canadian on the fly, eh?

It will be interesting to see if they do.  At first, I refused to believe
that they would do it to WebCom.

I just thought I'd mention another technique for dealing with this problem.
It doesn't require dedicating disk space to specific sites; instead, it
relays through to any site you specify.

For an example, see "The Great Web Canadianizer" at
http://www.io.org/~themaxx/canada/can.html

To thwart censorship of specific sites, people who have a bit of bandwidth
to spare could set up cgi scripts like this one (without the text modification
the Canadianizer does -- that's its hack).  (Zundel's stuff is no less
offensive after the Canadianizer adds a bunch of "eh?"s and "hosers" and
changes all the "-ing"s to "-in'".)
