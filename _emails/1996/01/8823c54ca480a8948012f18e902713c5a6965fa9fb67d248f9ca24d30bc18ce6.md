Just a friendly reminder to those of you overwhelmed by the noise...

I provide a moderated version of the Cypherpunks list called
"Cypherpunks Lite".  A one year subscription costs US$20 and is
payable by check or money order to "COMSEC Partners". Cypherpunks Lite
is available in either individual messages or a more-or-less daily
message digest.  The content of both are the same.  In either case, I
forward approximately 5 - 10% of the total Cypherpunks feed.  This
works out to about 5 - 10 messages / day.

To take a look at what you can expect there is an archive of the previous
selections organized by month at ftp://ftp.crl.com/users/co/comsec/cp-lite.
The files with the extension .gz are compressed using gzip.

If you would like to subscribe, please send payment to:

	COMSEC Partners
	1275 Fourth Street, Suite 194
	Santa Rosa, CA 95404 USA

Be sure to provide the email address you want us to use, as well as
indicating your preference for individual messages or the digest.

Thanks again,
Eric Blossom
