Here is the final(?) information on the Portland Cypherpunks meeting.

Date:           Jan 20, 1996
Time:           5:23pm (discordian time)
Location:       The Habit Internet Cafe
                2633 S.E. 21st Av., Portland OR 97202
                SE 21st @ Clinton in Portland, OR
                (503)235-5321

For more information on the location, visit:

http://www.teleport.com/~habit/ 

We will be having a key signing and other activities, as well as general
socializing.  Bring information on projects you are pursuing or questions you
would like to ask.

Please leave your cameras and other photographic equiptment at home as some
of the people attending are pretty camera shy.  (And not shy about informing
you of it...)

It looks like we will be getting people outside of the Portland metro area
attending as well.  (I have heard from at least one person from the Bay area 
and one from Seattle, so who knows how many will show up.)

If you want to be on the information list for this, just send me e-mail at
alano@teleport.com.

If all goes well, this may turn into a regular thing...
