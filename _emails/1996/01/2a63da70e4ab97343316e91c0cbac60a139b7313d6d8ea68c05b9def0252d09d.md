Run, don't walk, to check out:

Qualcomm's own Eudora support team recommended it, and it works seamlessly.
To use it with Eudora, important point: after installing WPGP, go into
Options|Select Keystrokes and  make sure "Use Capture mode" and "Use Select
All" are selected (and "Use Memorizer" should -not- be selected), otherwise
you'll get errors about 'no selected text'.  That's it; you're up and running.

Example of using WPGP: After writing your message as usual in Eudora, to
encrypt simply click on WPGP's "Enc" button and then click on the window
containing your message; that's it, very slick.  Another example: If you get
a PGP-encrypted email and want to reply, just hit Eudora's Reply as usual
(this will ">"-quote the entire original email as usual including the PGP
block), click on WPGP to "Dec"rypt, and click anywhere on your reply
window... it will pick out the PGP block, decrypt it, inform you about valid
signatures etc., and automatically paste the reply back into your window in
the proper place WITH PLAINTEXT PROPERLY QUOTED, as if you'd got the message
straight in the clear and hit 'Reply'.

Highly recommended.

Herb
