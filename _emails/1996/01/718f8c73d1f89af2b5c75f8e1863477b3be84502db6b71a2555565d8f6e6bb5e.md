Apologies - this mailer doesn't give me any indication

I'm not saying that trust requires identity (it obviously doesn't,
since we all make trusted cash transactions all the time
without having to produce any id.).  But it is usually easier to
determine (and vouch for) who a stranger is than how trustworthy 
they are, if only because there are quick and easy real-world 
mechanisms for this (driver's licence, passport,etc.).   That's all 
I meant.

(BTW, can you lend me a few bucks? :-)

That's an extremely useful way of looking at it, I agree.
But the lifetime of a key is often less than that of some
attribute.  It's easy to imagine one email address having
a succession of keys.  But then again, one might
acquire and discard email address more often than
keys (I've gone through three addresses in the last year 
or so).  So perhaps a better model is just a loose 
assocation of attributes, with "key(s)" and "identity(s)"
being two very interesting ones, but no one attribute
being primary all the time.

(I'm thinking out loud here -- I'm actually trying to come
up with some C++ classes for this sort of stuff, so this
discussion is pretty interesting to me.  Thus far, I'd got 
to the model you describe - a key has a bunch of 
attributes, one them identity. But now I'm thinking that
this maybe isn't enough, and an 'identity-centric' view is
also needed.  Perhaps there should be multiple views
into the same data?).

Right.  I was only talking about 'verinyms', really.
