I forget how it is termed in ITAR, but expertise can't be exported 
either.  Another thing to remember is that Jeff and the others at 
Netscape aren't writing the encryption algorithms themselves, they 
implement the code that they get from RSA.  Though most of the 
code they get from RSA is already available abroad, if they wanted to 
import it they would face serious copywrite problems with RSA.  Also, 
like I suggested before any programers who gained their knowledge of 
crypto programing in the U.S. and then went abroad and developed 
crypto software would be in danger of prosecution under ITAR if they 
ever returned to the U.S..
