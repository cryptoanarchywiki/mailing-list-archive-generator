You mean that the thirty-some odd open news servers listed on
http://dana.ucc.nau.edu/~jwa/open-sites.html might get swamped.  Then the
CIS refugees will be forced to pay Sameer the massive $12.50 (?) a month for
a net-access-only account and read off of c2.org's server.  (Or any of the
thousands of sites worldwide one can open a shell account on.)
