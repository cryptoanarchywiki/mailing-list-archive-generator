Ask Sean at dra.com. The s/w industry even designs library systems
so as to purge data the Feebs might want. That that does not exist can
not be surrendered.

And this is not a cost-free choice to them. There is & will be a
percentage of book vandals. If your circulation system could tell you:
	Who checked out X, Y, Z & T?
You might catch the creeps. But they prefer buying new books to the
alternative....
