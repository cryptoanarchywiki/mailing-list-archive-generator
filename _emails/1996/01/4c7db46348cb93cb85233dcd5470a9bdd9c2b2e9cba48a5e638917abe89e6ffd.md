  Friend, 
 
 
  I believe the co-author is Wayne Madsen, who's written: 
 
          Handbook of Personal Data Protection 
 
          Stockton Press (an imprint of Groves Dictionaries, 
            which is in turn a division of Macmillan Publica- 
            tions, Ltd) 
 
          1992 
 
          1026 pages 
 
          US $170 
 
          ISBN 1 56157 046 0 
 
          1 800 221 2123. 
 
 
  Please see Jyri Kaljundi's message below.  Madsen is interviewed 
  in Web Review's series on NSA's subversion of the private sector, 
  here at home as well as abroad. 
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim

Huh? Oh you mean Applied Crypto 2. I was asking about Puzzle Palace 2 by 
Bamford, which I saw listed in AC2's bibliography. Can't seem to find it.
I was just wondering if it's worth ordering. (Maybe I wasn't clear in my 
last msg.) 

Btw, anyone know what else Bamford's been doing since he wrote Puzzle Palace 1,
in '82? Any other books, articles? He's a Washington lawyer, right? I 
hear the new edition has a collaborating author; anything on him? Curious.

TIA.
