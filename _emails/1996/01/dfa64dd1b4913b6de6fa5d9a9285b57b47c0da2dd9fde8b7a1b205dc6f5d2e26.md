After getting another batch of bounce messages from Microsoft's Postmaster,
I have reluctantly decided to filter out all messages from Microsoft.com
until they fix this problem with Microsoft Exchange.

Their latest message was:

*****

Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

Rather than fight their misconfigured mail system, or try to convince them
to change their ways so as to conform to accepted practices, I'll just use
technology.
