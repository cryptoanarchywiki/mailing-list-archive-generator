I'm not a psychologist, but I have worked in the Information Security field
for a while now.

When a system is breached or a CERT Advisory is issued, this is a major
embarassment for the company.  The breach (or publicized security flaw)
shakes the confidence of people in the vendor's products.  People are 
rather unwilling to risk putting their business-critical data on a system 
which has just recently breached.  This lack of confidence translates into
a loss in sales.  If unchecked or the case if severe enough, this could 
also translate into a loss of jobs.

If the consumers (or some key major players) put pressure on the vendors 
to secure their systems, then it will happen.  Until then, the vendors
will continue provide us in the Information Security field with unparalleled 
job security.  8^)  You would be surprised how bad the situation really
is and how many companies are vulnerable and to what extent (then again, 
you may not).

We now return you to your discussion on crypto.  8^)
