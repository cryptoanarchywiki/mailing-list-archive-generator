Just part of the ongoing conflict between Anglo-Saxon values and European
values.  Runnymede vs Canossa.  TCP/IP vs X.25.  Some think that one should

DCF

"Canossa -- In Germany, HENRY IV joined the antireform party and was
excommunicated (1076) by Pope Gregory VII. Losing support, Henry humbled
himself before Gregory at Canossa."
