  I think that you are putting too much faith in both the western
governments and the citizens of those countries.  If you read the article
that I originally quoted, you will find that the author (in the UK) feels
that the first ammendment gives us in the US too much freedom of speech.
I think that many (perhaps most) feel the same way.  They are willing to
give up their liberty for some dubious protections as Ben Franklin spins
in his grave.
