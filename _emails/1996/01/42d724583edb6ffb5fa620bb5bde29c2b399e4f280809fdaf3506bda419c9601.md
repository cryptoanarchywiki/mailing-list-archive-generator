This doesn't tell the whole truth.

The "free world" mirrors are at Stanford, CMU, MIT, and Penn. The growth
path for these is my request to Zundel -> Zundel's drone Marc -> my site
-> Declan's most excellent evangelization -> everyone else. We believe
that this "revisionism" is crap, but don't think censorship is so cool,
either. 

The partial UT and AOL mirrors are run by white supremacists who actually 
believe this shit, and who are trying to claim credit for the whole idea, 
which among other things I find a little dishonest. I believe their 
direct source is Marc or Ingrid.

I think this no longer has any cypherpunk relevance. Censorship lost, end
of story; the only question is how quickly "they" will admit it. See
Declan's or my pages, or email me for the early history from my POV. 
Apparently Declan has been posting on this in the Well forums since 
December as well.
