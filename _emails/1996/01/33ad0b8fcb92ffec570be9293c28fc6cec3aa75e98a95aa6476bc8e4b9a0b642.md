Something just came to mind...  What if there is not difference between the
exportable and non-exportable versions?  Could it be that they are *both* GAKed?

Maybe I am just being paranoid (or thinking that IBM might just be lazy
enough to push out a single version under two versions), but it is something
that needs to be determined.

Does anyone out there have access to both versions for a comparison?
