A little while back there were some very helpful posts about getting started wit
open NNTP servers.  Since my regular site runs kinda slow in the news department
I've been having fun poking around and seeing about getting more current.

Then it dawned on me.  People keep logs.  Presumably routine logging would point
right back at my ISP, and from there it'd be not too hard to pin down me 
specifically.  No, I don't think anyone is particularly *likely* to do that, but
why take chances?

So...anyone know of open NNTP servers that *don't* keep logs?  Or some other way
around the problem?

Thanks!
