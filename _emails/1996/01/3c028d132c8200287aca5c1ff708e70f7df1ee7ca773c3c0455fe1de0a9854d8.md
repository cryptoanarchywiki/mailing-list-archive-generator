If I were standing in one of the places where NSA has it's taps of the 
Net - what would I see? Alligator clips across terminal strips, leading 
to a bunch of T3 lines?

Is there any open source - or otherwise - knowledge or speculation about
which words/phrases the Terra-cycle cpu's are text-searching *for*?  If it
were your responsibility to eavesdrop on Iranian terrorists - or French
Commercial Attache reports to Paris - or to have UK nationals, off in
their private room of your building, write down the name of every in
America who expresses a libertarian dissatisfaction with the Republicrat
regime - would you know for sure which words/phrases to key on?   It 
doesn't sound like a tractable problem to me.

Of course, some people don't need to worry about the GAO doing their own 
evaluation of how well an agency is doing its assigned mission!
