The problem is *not* at my end, your ignorance is showing.  If it were, 
then everyone would be getting 2 copies of everything I send, and that's 
simply not true.  Some people are getting two copies, but some are only 
getting one copy.

My understanding of anonymous remailers has nothing to do with this - 
I've not posted or emailed through one, so I don't know where this 
comment is coming from.  As for configuring sendmail, I would not be 
afraid to estimate that I've probably configured sendmail for more 
systems than you've ever seen in your entire life, so if my technical 
qualifications are in doubt, they are in doubt only in your own mind.  My 
employer (and all of my employers for the last 16 years) have paid 
relatively well for my technical shills, and continue to do so.

> Please stop polluting this mailing list with test messages. Thank you.

I would suggest that it is *your* lack of technical expertise that is at 
the root of your not neing able to set up procmail.  Besides, if you want 
to filter my posts or email, filter will do the job, and it's so fast and 
easy to set up that I taught an ex- to do it in about 10 minutes - and 
she has trouble finding the on/off switch to her computer.

Please stop polluting the list with your flames.
