I agree.  It's not a good idea to assume that there's going to be some kind
of widespread opposition movement when the big Net Crackdown comes.  Most
people will either obey the law, be unaffected by it, or violate it in very
insignificant ways ("net jaywalking").  There's strength in numbers, but I
just don't think the numbers will be there.
