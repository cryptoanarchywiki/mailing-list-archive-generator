  It would not be much harder than the demonstrated keyboard attack
to create a hacked version of winsock that would implement an
attack against First Virtual.  If the attacker had a list of web
pages that accept FV payments it would be very easy to collect
the ID numbers.  There is no need to attack the large datastream
of keyboard input when the search can be easily narrowed.  Since
FV doesn't use encryption the attack could easily be implemented
in winsock, making it independent of any client software.  A version
that infected the win95 IP stack could be quite effective.  The list
of FV accepting sites would be easily obtainable via a query of
altavista.  Since the infected system is on the internet and has
to periodically send its results to the attacker, it could download
an updated list of FV pages at the same time.  

  Attacking the e-mail verification step of the FV system could also
be accomplished via a hacked winsock.  A bit of POP3 aware code
in the winsock could intercept the verification messages and keep
the e-mail client from ever seeing them.  It could automatically
generate "Yes" responses for all such messages.

  I believe that FV is just as vulnerable to these types of
attacks as any of the encryption based credit card schemes, if
not more so.  The thing that really protects FV is that it can
only be used to buy bit, not real goods, and the bad guys don't
generally care about stealing bits.  This is also what makes FV
not generally useful to people who want to shop over the internet.
