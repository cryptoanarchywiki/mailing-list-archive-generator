   The Jan 6 Emist reports on the $488m callback game:

      Callback services exploit the fact that in many
      countries it costs more to make one international
      telephone call than to make two from America. By the end
      of the year more than 100 American companies will be
      selling the service.  Places that have tried to stop the
      services include Saudi Arabia, Argentina, South Korea,
      China, Malaysia and Canada's North West Territories,
      where even local calls were cheaper by callback.

      The operators believe they are beyond the reach of local
      laws. Even if laws are passed, technology makes them
      hard to police. "It's a cat and mouse game," one says.
      "It's kind of fun."
