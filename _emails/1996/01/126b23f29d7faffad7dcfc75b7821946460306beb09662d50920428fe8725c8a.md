Actually, I think she was just fucking with his mind...

It sounds like an answer that I would give to a paranoid newbie, given half
the chance.  (If I had thought of it...) "A mindfuck is a terrible thing to
waste."

I am sometimes surprised at the number of "They have broken PGP" stories I
keep hearing.  People who know NOTHING about cryptography somehow "know"
that PGP has somehow been "broken".  I wonder how these memes are getting
into the culture at large?
