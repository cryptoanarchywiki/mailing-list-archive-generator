As a short, elegant, powerful argument against statist thinking, I recommend
most highly Kenichi Ohmae's THE END OF THE NATION STATE: THE RISE OF
REGIONAL ECONOMIES. Mr Ohmae focuses on areas that have geographical and
social meaningfulness, on the scale of Hong Kong/Canton, Catalonia, the
Pacific Northwest, and so forth. He quickly makes hash of the idea that the
nation-state is a meaningful unit for modern economic analysis.

ObCrypto: He looks for region-state governments that, among other things,
respect citizens' privacy.
