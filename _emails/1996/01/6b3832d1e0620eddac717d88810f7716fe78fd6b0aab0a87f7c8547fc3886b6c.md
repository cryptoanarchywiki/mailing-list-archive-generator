I was thinking of the itenerant frequencies around 151 MHz, but the 
bandwidth would be limited.  I wasn't thinking of amateur frequencies, 
but my fingers sometimes have a mind of their own ;)

I'd love to see plans (or used commercial gear) able to do this - I've 
got a point-to-point application that I'd love to set up ...

The opportunities for this sort of thing are amazing.  And remember, 
there are two types of spread spectrum - the high bandwidth stuff as well 
as the frequency hopping stuff.

Again, I'd like to see this, too...
