Suppose, however, the goal was NOT to erase the media, but simply to reset 
(temporarily crash) the computers inside.  Please recalculate based on:

1.  A 72,000 volt, 0.8 microfarad capacitor, fully charged.
2.  One turn of, say, #16 wire around the building.
3.  A (sacrificial) improvised switch constructed by forcing a sharpened 
point through a thin, insulating layer of polyethylene plastic sheet against 
a conductive plate, which 
eventually (and catastrophically) arcs through the remaining fraction of a 
millimeter to produce an exceedingly low-impedance contact in a microsecond 
or so.
