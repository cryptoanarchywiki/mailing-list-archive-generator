Present day Ecash is bases on online clearing. I does not encode any user
idendifiying information into the coin. You are thinking of offline Ecash.
Besides, wherer users get the Ecash from, be it by putting money into their
account at MT or buying it from you doesn't matter. They still need an
account with MT.
