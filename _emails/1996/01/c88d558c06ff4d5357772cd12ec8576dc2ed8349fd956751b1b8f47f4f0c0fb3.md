The use of encryption is in no way forbidden in France. It just has
to be approved beforehand, which up to recently amounted to pretty
much the same (-:. But, due to industry pressure, things are changing.
Netscape can now market its secure server in France, as well as the
export-version browser. I haven't heard of anyone having their PGP
approved yet though..

Best, Cedric.
