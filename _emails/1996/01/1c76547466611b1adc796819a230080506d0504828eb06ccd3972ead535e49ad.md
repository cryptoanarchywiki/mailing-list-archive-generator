   Today's third article of The Washington Post series on "The
   Politics of Mistrust" is:

   "Angry Female Voters a Growing Force."

      Remember angry white males? Well, hear now from the
      women. They are more likely than men to have become
      anxious about the economy and distrustful of govermnent.
      But what separates men from women in this worried
      segment of the electorate is that they seem less
      concerned with their own plight than they are with the
      economic prospects for their children and their
      neighbors, including the poor.

   Next: The anti-government electorate.
