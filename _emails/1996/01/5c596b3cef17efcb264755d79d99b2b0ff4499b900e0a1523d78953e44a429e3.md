Aha, at last some cypherpunk relevance. Would the post have been ok if it
had been signed? 

Anonymity isn't the issue, content is.  No one needs a reason or special
justification for anonymity -- we're entitled to it.  But we're also 
entitled to ignore people we don't want to communicate with, including 
anonymous people.

This is Eric's list, and he's entitled to make a rule that anonymous posts
aren't allowed, but he hasn't done so -- anonymous posts are ok.  If we
don't like Eric's rules, we're entitled to set up another list with
different rules on another server and post there.  And of course if you
don't like anonymous posts, you're entitled to skip them. 

Banning anonymity doesn't give you any protection at all from off topic
posts.  Check the archives if you don't believe me.
