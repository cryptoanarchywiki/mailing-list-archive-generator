The John Doe NYM/Remailer interface for Windows is a most excellent
program that will allow even the most cypher-illiterate to make use of
the technology that has been the exclusive domain of those in the
"techno-know".  It was a piece of cake to set up, obtain a NYM and select
inbound and outbound remailers with options to chain as many as your
paranoia deemed appropriate.

$25.00 seemed a little steep but they will get my $$$.  Nice Job.
