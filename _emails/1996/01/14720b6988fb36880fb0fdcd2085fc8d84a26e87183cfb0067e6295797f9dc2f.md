Er no, in practice it is hard to persue a libel case in the UK where the
publication has responded immediately with a printed apology - especially
if the apology is prominently placed.  The mail catenated to Godwin's
comments (from PRZ himself) indicates that the Sunday Telegraph will be
publishing such an apology in their next edition.  An out of court 
settlement, apart from lawyers costs, may yield a charitable donation but
it certainly looks like PRZ will benefit from a sympathetic article 
which seems to me to be a pretty good result!
