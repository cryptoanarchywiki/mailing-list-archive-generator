I think people are missing the point... even if we assume the absolute worst
case, that the private key is broken and becomes publicly available,
international Notes users are no worse off than before.

That said, it shouldn't happen soon.  One of the things Ray said in his
announcement was that the government agreed to both generate and then guard
this key with the same diligence with which they guard their most important
secrets (he specifically mentioned nuclear missile controls).  While it
makes for a nice sound bite, I'm comfortable that there's probably also a
lot of truth to it.
