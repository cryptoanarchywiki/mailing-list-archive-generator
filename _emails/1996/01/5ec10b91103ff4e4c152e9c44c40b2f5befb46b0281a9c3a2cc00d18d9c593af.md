They could have shipped strong encryption and let the lawyers handle the
Feds.  That's what lawyers are for.  A court loss would be unlikely.  Even
with a loss, having IBM serve a 54-month jail term would be no prob.  It
could do it standing on its head.  They were probably more worried by
possible retaliation in government purchasing.

Those who crossed The Wall around 10:00 pm on November 10, 1989 proved that
modern (weak) governments can be faced down by large movements of people.  

Companies will learn that end-users are less sanguine about being censored
(by Compuserve) or opening one's business affairs to (any) governments than
perhaps they used to be.  Small competitors will benefit.
