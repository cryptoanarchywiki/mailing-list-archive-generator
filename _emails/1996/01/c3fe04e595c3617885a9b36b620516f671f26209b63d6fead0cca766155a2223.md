I'm looking, on behalf of the COmputer Security Institute, for someone who
is willing to give a 1.5 hour PGP primer at their summer conference in
SF.  They don't pay, but they will give you free admission into the conference
(and two bad hotel conference meals).

I speak at their conferences; they're not a bad lot.  Interested parties 
should email me directly.

Bruce
