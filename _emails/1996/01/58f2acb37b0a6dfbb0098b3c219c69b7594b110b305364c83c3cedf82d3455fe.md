You might wish to look at the Apple DigiSign design. RSA DSI ran a CA
under contract as a notary enrollment system for 2 years. The people from
RSA DSI,
now at Verisign, have a certain amount of experience with this system.

I dont understand how you intend to make CA spoofing illegal. Who
who perform the enforcement? (By illegal, I assume you mean that
there is a criminal offence involved, rather than a tort.)

This has been tried, and many certificates issued under a variant
of this scheme. it seems likely that only an ABA-certified notary
would be reasonaby secure from professional liabilities. Good
efforts have been made to qualify what the professional procedures would
be.

Notary fees might be best controlled by the notary, not the CA. Seems
an unreasonable restriction of trade to price-fix, even at the low-end.

There is indeed a large body of legal ramifications in this
area. The best way to learn about it is to become a CA and do it. Risk
taking is part of being in the CA business, however you operate it,
even for free.

Running as a not-for-profit may not prevent general liability. You can
give the service away for free and will still be liable for the
mis-representations you or your agents make. There are DARPA reports written
about
the issue (though these do not usually constitute advice.)

Navigator betas seem to already facilitate users configuring their own
trust points in a manner rather similar to adding a key to your
personal PGP keyring.

IBM browsers allow formal configuration of trust points.

CAs as a business and economic growth area are just happening. We have
two declared companies; Verisign and GTE. I personally expect another
10-20 to declare soon. The large (phone company) networks seem to
be where the current action is, followed by the large accounting firms. As
a small software company, I personally back the other similarly
small software companies making and selling organizational CA
systems to help people manage their own community of interest as
they see fit.
