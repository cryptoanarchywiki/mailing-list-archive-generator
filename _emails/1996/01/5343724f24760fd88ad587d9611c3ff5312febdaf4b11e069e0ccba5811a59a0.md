	Ah, but consider what happens when Java (or Java-esque platform
independant executable content) really takes off.  

	Gee, your browser doesn't know how to view image/stego?
Just pull down https://foobaz.com/isView.class and off you go.  (Or your
browser will pull it down automagically for you and pay the author for 
it from your ewallet.  Or it could rent a copy from Blockbuster(tm)
Applets.  You get the idea :) Software will become less and less what your 
machine has and more what it has access to.
