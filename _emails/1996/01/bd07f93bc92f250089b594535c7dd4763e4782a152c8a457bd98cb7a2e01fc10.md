Pretty hard. That's why the corporate officers will be jailed instead. Not
that this would be necessary to stop the corporation from operating.  The
authorities can just confiscating all the equipment and thereby put the
corporation out of business. Saves time and trial costs. They just haul off
the computers and declare that they are now property of the government.
