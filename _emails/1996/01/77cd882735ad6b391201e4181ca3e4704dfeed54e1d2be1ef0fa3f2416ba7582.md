The following is the result of my own experiments, performed when a) I
started noticing that my remailing times didn't seem to match the ping lists
available and b) another local guy posted a format that seemed useful, so I
swiped it.

I mailed through each of the remailers listed below ten times over the
course of eight days (10 Jan 96 to 18 Jan 96) - posts went out spread across
all hours of the day and night, to compensate for congestion at high-traffic
times. (Insomnia's value as a research aid, coming soon to a major
scientific journal.) Each post went through the remailer, to a nym server,
back through the remailer, and then to me. The trip time is the interval
from the end of a posting session with Eudora and PPP connection to Teleport
to the arrival of a message in my mailbox at Teleport. Times are given in
hours and minutes. "Failure" means that I hadn't gotten a reply back within
four days of posting it.

I anticipate doing this on a monthly basis, and would be delighted to hear
from anyone else doing the same. Joel McNamara has raised the possibility of
a net resource that would feed back the data for whatever region is closet
to the inquirer, which sounds seriously cool to me.

[1] On the 19th or 20th, extropia.wimsey.com suddenly cleared backlog, and
all my messages did go through. So I'll see how it does in February; looks
like they had a week-long weirdness of some kind.

Comments welcome.
