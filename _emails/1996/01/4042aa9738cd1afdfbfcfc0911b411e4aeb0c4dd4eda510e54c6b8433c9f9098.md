Unfortunately, neither of those sites have it.

The version I'm looking for has a blf_ctx structure that gets passed
as the first argument to functions so you can use multiple keys at a
time.  It also has the initialization data stuck in the C code.

Does anyone out there have the Applied Cryptography source code
diskette?  Would you be willing to mail me the code?  It would
probably take a while if I ordered the diskette myself and I'd like to
get the code as soon as possible.

Thanks,
David
