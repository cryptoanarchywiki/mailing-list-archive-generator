Title:          Takedown: The Capture of Kevin Mitnick

                        Abstract

Shimomura and Markoff will talk about the pursuit and capture of Kevin
Mitnick, a 32-year old computer programmer who was arrested in
Raleigh, N.C. last year by the FBI, after Shimomura, working on behalf
of several Internet service providers,  traced him to an apartment
complex on the outskirts of the city. Shimomura and Markoff have
cooperated to write a soon to be released book about the pursuit,
Takedown (Hyperion 1996)
