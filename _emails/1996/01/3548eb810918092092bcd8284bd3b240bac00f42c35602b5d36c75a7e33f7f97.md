My laptop's latitude and longitude aren't constants....

And a DNS record identifying the precise location of
compuserve.com or netcom.com might not be very meaningful;
a more detailed record identifying the location of
port5.paloalto-annex-3.netcom.com might tell you which
terminal server to aim an ICBM at, but won't tell you where
I dialed in to it from.  But it still won't tell you if the
user is in Washington DC or Germany, though perhaps a DNS record
for Snow-Depth might be a bit more informative.

There are several geography servers on the net, which can tell you
the lat/long for a city (more useful if your city is, say, 
Holmdel NJ than if it's Los Angeles.)  

Or you can buy one of those $12.95 CD-ROMs with all the street
addresses in the US on them (perhaps at the cost of adding a 
PC or Mac and CDROM drive to run the software...)
Feed it a street address, and you can get pretty close (mine
actually targets the other end of my block, but it's not
doing interpolations...)
