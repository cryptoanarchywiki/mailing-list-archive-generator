	Undeniable digital signatures.  They're not 'undeniable'
differently from normal digital signatures, but they do require the
cooperation of the signer to confirm the signature.  Thus, a KCA could
decide only to verify a signature 50 times, or once per day (or once
per being paid the $10 signature verification fee.)

	Schneier has a decent amount on undeniable digital signatures.
