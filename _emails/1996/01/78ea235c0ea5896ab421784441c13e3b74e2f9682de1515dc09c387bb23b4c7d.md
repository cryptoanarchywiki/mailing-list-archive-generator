I agree. When I was replying to Bill Frantz's points, I neglected to
comment on this point.

Suppose "alt.fan.barney" is rated G, by "someone." Since I can post stuff
with strong language, and worse, to alt.fan.barney, is it still rated G, or
was my stuff blocked?

When the Germans told MeinKampfuServe to block 200+ newsgroups (well, it's
clear that some BavarianKops showed MKS a list of groups that they thought
needed to be pulled, and MKS obliged them), a bunch of folks started
copying soc.culture.german on some highly explicit stuff normally found in
alt.sex.*. No word yet on whether soc.culture.german is now banned in
Germany.
