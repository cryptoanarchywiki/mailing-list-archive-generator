I believe I had a problem when I wanted to get PGP coming from 
internexus.net (New Jersey). I just e-mailed them about it and I think 
they just added the site to their 'acceptable' list. I did a traceroute 
to why.net and noticed that it is very close to me, coming off of 
SprintNet... probably the same situation.
