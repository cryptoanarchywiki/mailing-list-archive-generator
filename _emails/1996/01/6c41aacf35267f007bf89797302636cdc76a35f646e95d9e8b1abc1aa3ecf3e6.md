It looks to me as if Microsoft has a way to go on e-mail. Every message I
send to the list generates long bounce messages sent back to me. I assume
others are getting the same thing.

For example, just the latest one, sent from Postmaster
<postmaster@microsoft.com>:

The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      Zeke Lucas on 01/03/96 22:50:19
            The recipient name is not recognized
            [MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:northamerica:RED-70-MSG]

      Bruce E. Johnson on 01/03/96 22:50:19
            The recipient name is not recognized
            [MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:northamerica:RED-70-MSG]

      Christopher Carper on 01/03/96 22:50:19
            The recipient name is not recognized
            [MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:northamerica:RED-70-MSG]

      John Douceur on 01/03/96 22:50:19
            The recipient name is not recognized
            [MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:northamerica:RED-70-MSG]

      Mike Montague on 01/03/96 22:50:19
            The recipient name is not recognized
            [MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:northamerica:RED-70-MSG]

Etc.


Either Microsoft handles undeliverable mail different from most other
places, or they don't want employees getting the Cypherpunks list (:-}). I
suspect the former.
