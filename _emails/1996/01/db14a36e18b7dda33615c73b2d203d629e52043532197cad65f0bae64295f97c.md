Not that this can't happen, but as I understand it, Java puts up a rather
distinctive popup, so that you know that it's Java doing it.  As people
are on the net, I wouldn't expect them to be so stupid as to answer a
"Please enter your password" prompt with anything meaningful.  As to your
second question, I think that this is rather outside the scope of the Java
system's control. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's only so much you can do to
protect people from themselves.  As with anything else, Java won't prevent
you from doing something stupid - nor IMO should it.  If that were true,
we'd all still be riding in buggies pulled by horses.
