Hey! I've just had an epiphany. HOToL promised much cheaper costs to put 
things in LEO. The initial design was finished and tested, but nobody 
would provide the funds for the second round or implementation (probably 
because it wasn't French enough :) 

Nowdays, anything involving the Internet automatically gets ridiculous 
levels of funding. If we can just get John Markoff or Walter Mossberg to 
declare HOTol to be an Internet Technology they'll be able to use 
banknotes as heat shields.
