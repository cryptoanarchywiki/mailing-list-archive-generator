Escrow is orthogonal to the underlying problem here, which is that the
PGP revocation model is completely wrong.  Since the trust properties
and other semantics of a key originate with the certificates attached to
the key, and not from the key owner per se, it makes little sense to make
the key owner responsible for revoking that trust.  Far more sensible would
be a scheme in which the certificate issuers themselves could revoke their
certificates when they believe a key is no longer trustworthy.  (A practical
decentralized system like PGP could provide a facility for certifiers to
"pre-revoke" their certificates at the time they are issued so that the key
owner could distribute the revocation certificates himself if he discovers
his own key to have been compromised or lost.)

Note that the problem here is in the basic trust model, not just the
certificate distribution model (which is a separate problem).  The lack of
ability for a certifier to revoke his own certification, plus the lack of a
facility to put limits on the duration and meaning of the certification,
make PGP certificates of very limited practical value.
