Umm - that is not news, it's an old hacker trick originally used for
scamming login/passwd pairs.

I've seen this done as either a patch to the telcom program used in a
public lab on campus (this was actually quite clever - it'd wait till you
completed your login and then email the cracker your login/passwd while
simultaneously keeping the information from appearing on screen.  It even
kept his email address encrypted so I had to use a debugger to find it) or
as a TSR or Macintosh extension.
