Er...did I post it to the list, and if I did, why didn't it appear
there? This was a *private* message to you, according to my logs.
Perhaps you should take a bit more care in responding to look at
the message headers before hitting the entire list automatically.
Private e-mail is, after all, still a possibility, even for the
cypherpunks...

Again, an offer of *proof* of my posting would be appropriate here.
The message you got wasn't PGPsigned, which is a good clue I did not
send it to the list. I hereby bet $10,000.00 e-cash [hell, I need the
money!] that I made NO such posting to the cypherpunks list. I believe
an apology (or a bet) is in order. Of course, I'm hoping for the bet.
Switch to decaf, tallpaul!

PS. to the list. Please try to learn the big difference between
their, they're, there, etc. The ghost of my former English teacher
groans and moans inside my head when I see these errors. Strunk &
White is short and to the point on the subject. The Ghost and I
thank you.
