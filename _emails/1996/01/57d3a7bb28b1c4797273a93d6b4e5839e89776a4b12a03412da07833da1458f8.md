The reason I think a warning option is good (really, 1 bit bit flag 
for warn rather than kill... that's "bulk" to every key?) is so that 
if for whatever reason the key is used (say I am unable to get a 
newer key for you but really need to send you a private message) I 
have something to use... and you, if you choose to hold onto old 
keys, can decrypt it.  If not, the sender was warned.

Send a blank message with the subject "send pgp-key"
(not in quotes) for a copy of my PGP key.
