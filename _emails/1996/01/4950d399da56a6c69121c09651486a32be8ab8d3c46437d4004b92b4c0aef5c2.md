Has anyone looked at operating systems like Plan 9 which divide the services
into 3 sets (terminal, file, process) and then distribute them over various
machines (and cpu's in multi-cpu systems) on a 'cost' basis? 

This would effectively address the issue of where named, httpd, or whatever
was running. Mainly because it would never run on the same machine (or cpu)
each time or necessarily all the time (ie run a while here then over there).
