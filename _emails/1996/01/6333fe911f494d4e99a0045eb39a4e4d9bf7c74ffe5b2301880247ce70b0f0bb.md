A front-page article today in Network World about censoring 
access to sex-related Internet resources at the office.
Apparently, at Texaco, "a woman vehemently opposed
to pornography" has been assigned to review logs showing
who's been looking at what.  Workers who log onto remote
sites from Texaco to disguise their interests have not been
fooling this individual.
