To expand a bit:

I don't remember if it was a lieutenant, captain, or whatever, but he passed 
out the questionnaire in futherance of his master's degree in something or 
other. One question dealt with shooting civilians who disobeyed orders to 
turn over their arms, even if they were owned under what would now be 
considered legal circumstances. Shockingly, upwards of 25% of the soldiers 
(Marines, actually, as I remember it, I'll check my references if anyone 
wants) would have no problem doing so! This in spite of the fact that 
officers in the armed forces (not sure about enlisted men, but I believe 
it's true of them as well) swear an oath to uphold the Constitution against 
all enemies foreign and domestic - and I think that under the Constitution 
as it is now, forcibly depriving people of their arms would probably be a 
reasonable basis for considering them in contravention of the Constitution, 
and therefore enemies of it.

The notorious questionaire to the SEALS wasn't an official action. It was 
one lieutenient doing an assignment for a night class.

I never said that the federal government was good, or nice, or useful.
