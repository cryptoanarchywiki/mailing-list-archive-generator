This morning I read with bemusement (and amusement) the announcement of
FV's discovery of keystroke capture programs. Bemusement because we
discussed these in a Cypherpunks physical meeting a couple of years ago
(and on the list, too). Many of us even have them installed deliberately,
for error recovery.

Amusement because it looked like much ado about nothing.

Then I went out for the day--contrary to popular belief, I do occasionally
leave my Internet connection and venture outside--and happened to read the
local newspaper. There, in a major new story by Simson Garfinkel, was the
FV story plastered all over the newspaper.  FUD, indeed.

But, it occurred to me, this is just part of the larger syndrom. Simson's
article was practically written from the FV press release. While he
interviewed some "security experts," clearly the timing of his article
(this morning) and the announcement by Nathaniel of his discovery (this
morning) suggests the cozy relationship involved.

The larger syndrome is that software deals, alliances, mergers, and
problems are all based on hype. Nathaniel Borenstein issues press releases,
Sameer Parekh issues press releases, and maybe even I would issue press
releases if only I knew how to.

Every day the business news is dominated by stories of alliances and
partnerships between Microsoft, MCI, Intel, Apple, Sun, Verifone, DirectTV,
Newscorp, Sprint, AT&T, BT&T, CT&T, and all the rest. And a lot of it is
hype, posturing. Much of the supposed future will never emerge (anyone
remember Satellite Business Systems?)

Journalists seem to love this, because the press releases write the
stories. Companies like it, too, because they can get free newspaper space.
Everyone is scratching each other's back.

And those wacky Cypherpunks, with their t-shirts and their strange ideas,
are always good for a quick quote, too.
