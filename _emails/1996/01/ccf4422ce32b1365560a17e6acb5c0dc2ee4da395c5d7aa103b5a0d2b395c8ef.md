This may, in part, depend on your mode of transport.  Or maybe the phase 
of the moon.

In June of '93, I took a train from Rome to Nice, something which 
had worked nicely for me in the past.  That time we were all 
uncermoniously dumped out at a whistle-stop border checkpoint and forced 
to carry our luggage past some guys in uniforms.  I think some people got 
a quiz, though I did not.  After an hour or two, they let us board a 
*different* train to complete the last little bit of our journey.

That's the only border harassment I've experienced in Western Europe.  
Eastern Europe has been more interesting on occasion.
