I agree.  It all comes down to money, as you all know.  Do you think the 
bean counters and lawyers at MS see it proitable to announce such a 
obvious problem, no doubt running the risk of being unfavorably depicted 
in the ignorant mass media as offering a product that is "insecure?"  We 
all know what the responcible thing to do is.  I suspect marketing has a 
hand in quelling the idea of announcing this problem.  That's why I agree..
to a point.
