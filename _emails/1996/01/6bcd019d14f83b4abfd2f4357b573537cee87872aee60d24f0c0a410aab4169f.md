  Thanks for pointing out the bit about us claiming to have developed
SEPP.  I spoke to our Director of PR and it appears that the sentance
was mangled as the release was going through several rounds of revisions
between our PR dept. and VeriFone's.  A corrected version of the release
should be posted on our web site in the next few days.  It properly
indicate that SEPP (now SET?) is a cross industry effort that Netscape is
participating in.

  Sorry, no bugs bounty for press releases.  :-(
