I think a two-fold fix would be welcome;

1. The signing software needs to copy these headers within the body in
a standard way. I think I've seen a couple of such hacks already.
That's a welcome idea.

2. When PGP verified the signature, it should have an option to look outside
the signed portion for RFC 822 headers and compare them to the signed copy
of he headers inside. If this is not in PGP, then then function would have to
be done by some non-portable wrapper.
(Of course, if your headers aren't RFC 822, you're out of luck.)

(As someone pointed out, PGP already time-stamps the signature.)
