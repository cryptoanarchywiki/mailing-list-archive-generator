please don't try to make sensible replies to this type of tar-baby
garbage.  What's the point in arguing with someone who only wants 
you to argue with them and make sure you spell their name right?

First Virtual, you lost a lot of ground with me.
(sounds like others feel the same way, too).

... that sucking sound is your reputation capital being
snarfed off your keyboard and encrypted by tempest-bots
lurking just under your tinfoil helmet.  I'd be worried.

To which FV's own replied:

I trust you've seen by now that we made no claim to have discovered
keyboard sniffers.  Please read our claims more carefully, and I'd be
delighted to discuss them rationally.  -- Nathaniel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

delighted to discuss them at all, I would bet.  Anyone interested
in a discussion of whether or not keyboard sniffers work?

a pox on your virtual house for a bad spam, poorly aimed at this
list, in particular. 
NEVER TYPE CYPHERPUNKS@TOAD.COM IN THE TO: LINE
