I should also point out that Belgium apparently has crypto
export laws of sufficient complexity to inspire me to look
elsewhere when attempting to purchase a hardware encryption

was under the mistaken belief that I needed a US _import_
license; my failed attempts to persuade them otherwise was
the final kicker.
