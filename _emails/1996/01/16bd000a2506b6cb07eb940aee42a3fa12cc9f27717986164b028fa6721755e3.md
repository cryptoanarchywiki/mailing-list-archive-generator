I agree with your statements above about firewalls and wholeheartedly
agree that a firewall needs these characteristics (among others) to 
remain relatively secure.  However, I am I'm not saying that adding
firewalling capabilities would make the system invincible.  I *am* 
saying that it would provide the system with more security than it 
currently has and would help to reduce (not eliminate) some risks 
associated with networking.  

Of course, it would be terrific if the vendors would produce Operating 
Systems which are secure AND usable.  (I think the market will eventually 
demand this from vendors, but this probably won't happen in the next year 
or two.)

Agreed - to a point.  The idea is to provide the systems with increased
defensive capabilities - lowering potential risks.  (See above paragraph)


FWIW, I feel rather uncomfortable continuing this thread in the cypherpunks 
mailing list when the subject at hand deals more with firewalls than it 
does with cryptography.

I would prefer to continue this discussion in the firewalls mailing list
(of which I am a fairly regular participant).


If you would like to subscribe to the firewalls mailing list, send a mail to:

        majordomo@GreatCircle.com

(leaving the subject line blank)

and in the body of the message put:

subscribe firewalls "your_email_address" (omitting the quotes).


See you there.
