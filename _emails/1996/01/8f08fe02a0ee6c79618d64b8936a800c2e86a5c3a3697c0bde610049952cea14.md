I am posting these ideas here before I annoy the people who will probibly
implement them just to see if they have much merit...  (If this is incoherent
it is because of the late night posting, but I want to get it done while the
thoughts are still there...)  Maybe some of this will occur after PGP 3.0 is
released.  (That is, if the universe has not cooled down into a small lump of
coal before then...)

1) Something I would like to see on the keyservers for PGP is a way of 
retreving all of the key revokations since x date without having to get all of
the keys since that date.  I hate having to check each key every so often to 
see if it is revoked.  It would make it alot easier to avoid using compromised
or old unused keys.

2)  I would like to see a program like private Idaho have the ability to send
mail to the key server and grab all of the "unknown signator" keys.  This would
have the interesting effect of building a more complete keyring, while using 
the "web of trust" to weed out alot of the bogus keys that tend to crop up on
the key servers.  After n number of itenerations you would have more of the
"important keys" and the ones that have little or no signage would be left to
grab when needed.  This would avoid the need to grab the entire key database.
(In fact, it would make it desirable NOT to...)

More later when I am not so tired...
