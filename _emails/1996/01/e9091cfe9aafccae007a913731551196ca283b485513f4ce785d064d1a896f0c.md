        Thanks, that is very cool beyond just ecommerce, because what does
it mean for personal encryption?  If I buy one of these doo-hickeys for
$100, and so do you, does that mean we don't have to buy an AT&T 3600
(secure phone) to talk securely, and also not have to worry about Clipper
crap?  Or (as it probably is) does that mean we _have_ to talk through this
company and it only sends tiny bits of info from the card reader... (it'd be
cool if you could modify it...)
        Interesting.
