You might be surprised.   I've considered that very question, which is at 
the "outer limits" of my "Assassination Politics" idea.   Question: could 
the principles of that system eventually result in some sort of 
super-tyranny?  In my opinion, no, if for no other reason than the average 
person simply doesn't have enough time to attempt to be tyrannical against 5 
billion other people on the planet.

How would it work?  Well, let's suppose 95% of the public believed that 
EVERYBODY, including the other 5%, should pay the Widget tax.  Each citizen 
would have to pay it, and prove that he paid it, or those 95% would pay to 
have the 5% killed.  The Widget tax would buy Widgets from the WIdget 
manufacturer, and they would installed so as to benefit THE PUBLIC. 

Problem is, taxes are collected, not simply to take them from one person, 
but to give them to another.  The 5% might have to pay the Widget Tax, but 
they could also pay to have the immediate beneficiaries of the Widget Tax 
killed (the manufacturers of the widgets themselves, or at least those 
manufacturers that accept orders for widgets paid for by stolen tax 
dollars.)  At this point, nobody will risk making widgets anymore, so  the 
Tax will be unjustified and bandoned as uncollectible and useless.
