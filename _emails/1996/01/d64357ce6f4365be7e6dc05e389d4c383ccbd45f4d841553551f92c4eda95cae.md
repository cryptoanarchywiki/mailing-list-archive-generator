	The only technology that I'd trust to be useful much below
10-100 ms is GPS.   The others are unlikely to be controlled well enough
at the source to be trusted.  Current TV broadcasting, for example,
usually involves multiple passes though digital frame stores and time
base correctors  - most homes get the signal via cable which itself
involves significant uncontrolled delays  (juat the thermal changes
in propagation delay  in a long CATV cable and amplifier chain due to weather
changes run into the many microseconds).

	And humans beings being as imperfect as they are, it is hard to
beleive that making sure that the time being broadcast is really kept accurate
is going to be a priority when most people use it for purposes that require
plus or minus a few seconds timing.

	WWVB is the 60 khz broadcast (which is more accurate due to more
stable propagation) . the  HF ones are WWV.  Commercial time receivers
are available that work off the 60 khz time code (very narrow bandwidth
ASK), but the 60 khz is most used as a standard frequency for long
term tracking of error in local standards.

	If you run unix there are some quite sophisticated programs that
can use this specific clock (connected to a serial port) that allow sync
to the full accuracy possible at good times of day (around 1 ms).   The
programs also allow time distribution to other computers on a network -
thus their name  - ntp - which stands for network time protocol (and the
network time program that implements it). This protocol and the various unix
programs that implement it are quite widely used on commercial LANs and
the Internet to sychronize time amoung unix workstations, servers, and
bridges and routers.  Current implementations are capable of tracking
clock oscillator error on a system and adjusting the time periodically
to compensate for the frequency error of the clock and even to predict
(polynomial approximation) the change in frequency error with time.

	The man behind much of this (at least the early research) is
Dave Mills who used to be at louie.udel.edu which hosted a ftp
site for the programs.   An archie search will reveal where they
are kept now, and there is a newsgroup (comp.protocols.time.ntp) for this
which no doubt has a substantial faq file about this.

	I suspect that by this point there are several windoze/DOS  programs
to sync a PC to ntp time on a network, and perhaps even a program that will 
accept input from a Heath clock ... although the initial ntp code was
written for unix on Suns.

	Yes they use the RDS broadcast on the 57 khz subcarrier for this.
Of course there is no certainty the station has the clock set accurately.

	Yup.   And ntp can use several cheap gps products available to sync
a unix clock to high accuracy.

	Could be is the operative word here,  Many tv program
distribution signals carry frame time codes in the VIT, but who put them
there, how accurately they reflect local time  and where in the delay
chain (before or after the satellite for example) they get inserted is
not well controlled.   Nor is there a standard for the format that
addresses the needs of end users rather than broadcast production, or
any particular effort to ensure that a signal is reliably present in the
over the air transmission.

	Once many years ago (seventies)  the NBS (not NIST yet) tried to
get the TV networks to clock themselves with high accuracy rubidium
standards as a means of distributing standard frequency and time. But
technology has made this meaningless as most tv signals are now
distributed via satellites that move around several kilometers in a day
and clocked into multiple layers of frame stores (often delayed more
than a second)  in digital switching and processing gear and clocked out
with different clocks that often are not very accurate and not in any
way locked to the incoming network.

	TV stations could be made to maintain a local clock sync'd to
GPS and use that to do the final level of clocking out before feeding
the transmitter and could thus ensure that some reference point in some
frame happened at an exact time, but given that a user who can see a TV
signal can probably see GPS signals and can do the same timekeeping himself
for a couple hundred bucks it hardly seems worth it any more.  I do
expect that time codes with modest accuracy (few tens of ms at best)
will become common as part of the Starsite (or whatever they call it
now) program guide distribution on PBS, simply because this has defined
a format that can conveniantly contain time messages multiplexed with
other data and the box displays the time.  DSS and VC-II both also have
this capability, but of course the uncertainty of the satellite delay
limits accuracy and neither has provisions for providing time to other
devices.

	This is possible, but I bet the variations in phase in the local
distribution system due to power factor, choice of phase to use, propagation
time through transmission lines and substations and so forth would
mean that phase as observed at two distant sites was rather random
and maybe even subject to shifts over time as load conditions varied.

	I've seen some discussions about this, but don't know a reliable
answer.  I do know that the frequency is only 60 hz on the average over
a day and actually wanders up and down quite a bit more than one might
expect as load on the system varies.  I did some measurements of this 22
years ago while debugging some PDP-8E system software I wrote that that
ran a frequency counter (the ratio kind that was very accurate on low
frequencies) and found the diurnal variations surprisingly large and
quite interesting.  I've not repeated the experiment since but suspect
that they still allow the frequency to wander in response to load conditions.

	One could certainly do this, but there are subtlies ... some
places and institutions generate their power locally (and few if any
users know this or know whether or not they are on the grid), UPS
systems are common and wander off of the grid during a power fail,
and many buildings have all three phases floating around wall outlets,
even wall outlets close to each other so such acts as moving plugs
around might very well change the phase.  And power systems switch
phase correction capacitors in and out from time to time as power
factor of large loads varies.  My guess is that to synchronize much
below a ms would be hard, and that random losses and jumps of sync would be
common enough to require lots of special treatment in software.
