Does anyone know if there really is just one 24-bit key for every copy of
Lotus Notes or is this a miscommunication?  If there really is just one 24-bit
key for everyone, can't you just look for the bits that don't change among
different 64 bit keys?  (e.g. AND a "sufficiently large" number of 64-bit keys
together to find the 1's that don't change and then OR them to find the 0's
until you've got the 24 bit key).  Someone, please tell me that's not how it
works (or post the 24-bit key  :>).
