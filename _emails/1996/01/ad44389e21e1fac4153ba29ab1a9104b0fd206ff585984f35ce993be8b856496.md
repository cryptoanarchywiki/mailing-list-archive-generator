This appears to have happened in North America about 12000 years ago;
a highly competitive omnivorous predator/scavenger species appeared,
and either out-competed or killed off a number of other large predator
species, as well as some of the large grazing species.
Seen any dire-wolves looking through your windows lately?

Please don't abuse words like "right" for that sort of thing; it's as
tacky as abusing "one-time pad", and there are other words that will
do perfectly well, such as "unsurprising"....
