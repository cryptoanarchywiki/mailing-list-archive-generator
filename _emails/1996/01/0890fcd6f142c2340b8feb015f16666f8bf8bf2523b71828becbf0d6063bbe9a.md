   1-5-96. NYP:

   "2 Large Phone Companies Seek Higher Digital Rates. Critics
   See Damage to a Fast Internet Link."

      The proposal has angered people who use the ISDN
      service to work from home. Phil Karn, an engineer at
      Qualcomm, argued that the new tariff would cost him

      proposal to lift rates and was anxious to switch to 
      cable service when it became available.
