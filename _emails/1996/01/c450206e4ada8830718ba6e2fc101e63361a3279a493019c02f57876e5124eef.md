A. Olsen is too optimistic by far in his characterization of the likely
psychological state of the person who sent the above message. 
 
I just published my CyberAngel piece in _Computer underground Digest_ and,
during my researches, I heard a lot of material as least as hostile as the
mail Olsen posted. 
 
The hysteria over the Four Horseman, particularly the "kiddie
pornographers" is *intense.*  So is the ignorance. 
 
To repeat in a different form: 
 
the word is "hysteria" as in "Salem Witch Trials." 
 
the ignorance is intense, e.g. ".gif" is a "kiddie porn" code word for
"girlie interchage files" etc.etc.

families sit around on ratty old couches on the streets watching television
while rich megalomaniacs appropriate their body parts for their personal
