This is not that difficult for MS to work around - for example, they
could modify the code harmlessly before signing it. Unless you
know *how* they modified it, you can't reproduce it.

Example: some assembly instructions have more than one machine
code representation. MS could put some kind of cryptographically
strong pattern into these (ie one that can't be reverse-engineered).

ObCrypto: Stego in .EXE files?
