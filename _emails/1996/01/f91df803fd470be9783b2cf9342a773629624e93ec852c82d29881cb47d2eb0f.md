>I believe that one minor reason is the PKP chokehold on public-key patents.
It has slowed down adoption within the US, and the RSA licenses for example
tend to get very "interesting" when it involves places where their patents

	Speaking of other countries' non-recognition of algorithms as
patentable, are David Chaum's patents on digital cash enforceable outside of
the US?
	Thanks,
