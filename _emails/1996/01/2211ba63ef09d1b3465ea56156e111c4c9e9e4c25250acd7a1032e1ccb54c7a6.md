Mr. Peponis,
 I see what you are saying but doesn't it bother you the slightest bit? I
guess it is the principle of the whole thing for me. Look at us. Members of
a group that's purpose is to make computers free. We read hundred's and
hundred's of messages a week talking about crypto and legal stuff, because
we care about what happens on a economic, civil and most importantly a
personal level. I don't know it just bothers me that they are dragging
something so important to me throught the mud. They never mention the good
stuff like the OK City support group page, the use in schools, the
effectiveness of the internet as a research tool. And most of the time their
"internet" is AOL.
