What if you encrypt the encrypted software and put it on a server, and 
then have the key to it printed out on paper... you take the key with you 
to another country and fetch the 'incomplete' software through the net. 
It only becomes useful data once you apply your legally obtained key.

I guess this would be the same as putting the software on a private ftp 
site though, where only you would know the password.
