	If the 3 GAK bytes are derived from the key & the secret key,
couldn't it be done this way:

	* sender creates 64-bit session key K
	* sender encrypts K with recepient's public key (say P_r(K))
	* sender encrypts top 3 GAK bytes w/GAK key

	The recipent can verify the GAK bytes by using it's copy of
the GAK key on the top bytes of the session key.  If the encrypted
GAK bytes match what was sent, then they're valid.  No need to have
the secret key.
