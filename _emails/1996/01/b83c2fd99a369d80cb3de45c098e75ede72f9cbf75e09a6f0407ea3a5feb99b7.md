Most people are very nervous about running binaries on a unix box that
they get off the net, and nobody runs a setuid-to-root binary on their
system unless they paid $$$ for it and got it from a reputable vendor.  I
personally only run one binary on my machine that I didn't compile myself
- that's Netscape.
