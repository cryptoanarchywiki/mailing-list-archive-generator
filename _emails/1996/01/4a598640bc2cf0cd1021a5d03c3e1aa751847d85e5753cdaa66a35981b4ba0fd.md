E.g. if I post some Emacs-worshipping to alt.religion.emacs --- fine.
But if someone forwards this to some serious comp.editor group, maybe
some people don't understand the jokes...

Only one example why it can be neccessarry to include the context
(e.g. the recipient) into the signature.

The question is not if I care who reads it.  The question is in which
context (i.e. in which newsgroup) someone reads it.

Probably many people don't make this destinction between the message
and the context.  And additionally: I can only proove that someone
forwarded my message to a wrong context, when the context is signed,
too.

Sure, I can include context-information manually, but when we want as
many people as possible using strong-crypto, it should be as
fool-proof as possible.

Therefore I think it would be a good idea to include the context into
the signature.

{SNIP}

Then the receipient decrypts the message, encrypts it under another
person's public-key and forwards it to them.  And so the context has
changed, while my signature is still valid.....


Have a nice day!
