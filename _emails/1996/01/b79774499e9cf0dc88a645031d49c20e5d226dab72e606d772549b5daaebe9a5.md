Vague memories of Law School... Doesn't strict liability apply to
"inherently dangerous activities."  Like using explosives to demolish
buildings or something.  Is carrying message traffic an inherently dangerous
activity?  Any strict liability situations today not involving inherently
dangerous activity?

I suppose having disposed of waste in a "Superfund Site" leads to automatic
liability but does not necessarily involve an inherently dangerous activity.
Is this a "strict liability" situation?  I'm trying to think of other sorts
of examples.
