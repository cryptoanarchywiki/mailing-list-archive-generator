Hmmm, you should have some kind of Public Utility Commission (PUC) in your area
that regulates the service provider. Here in Texas if SWBT received more
than 2 complaints on a single problem without resolution then the customer
can request that the PUC force a resolution of the problem. It has the power
to fine SWBT on a per day basis until the problem is resolved. I have used
the process one time to a successful end. I had squirrels that kept eating
my phone lines when I first put in my ISDN and its dial-in lines. SWBT kept
comming out and repairing the lines and the squirrels kept eating them. I
asked for armored cables and was refused. I kept requesting them (and
keeping records). On the next to last time the tech came out I showed him
the records and advised him that I wanted armored lines. He said he would
advise his supervisor. A week later I had my armored lines (run specialy
nearly a block to the tie-block) and the problem was resolved until my
roomie burned the house down (the phone lines survived).

You also have the option of starting a civil and criminal claim dealing with
breach of contract. Phone companies must provide phone lines that meet
minimal standards (3kHz bandwidth / -32dB S/N). If the lines don't then the
phone company is responsible for getting the lines upgraded.

I rather doubt the phone company wants you out of business, they want your
money. It is probably a local supervisor who has a limited budget and staff
and is having to set priorities according to their supervisory
responsibilities. Get it taken up a level and you might find the climate
changes.

The FCC is enacting a new regulation that will cause every phone company to
provide 100% of their service areas with ISDN (you should have received some
kind of notice last week, I did). This also sets some minimum standards as
well as to the type and quality of service the phone company must provide.

Good luck.
