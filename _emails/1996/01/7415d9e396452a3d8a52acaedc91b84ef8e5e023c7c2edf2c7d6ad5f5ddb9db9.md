Columbus, Ohio (AP) -- The on-line service CompuServe says it hopes to
reopen access to 200 sexually oriented Internet forums to all but its
German customers by the end of the month...

	 CompuServe spokesman Jeff Shafer said Wednesday the Columbus-based
company is working on a software fix that will prevent Germans from
accessing the newsgroups while allowing access to customers in the rest
of the world...

 	Munich's senior public prosecutor, Manfred Wick, said this week his
office did not order a ban or provide CompuServe with any list as part
of its investigation of child pornography. But he acknowledged that
police asked CompuServe to scrutinize a list last month. `The decision
on whether and to what extent the groups on the list would be blocked
was left to CompuServe,'' Wick's statement said.
