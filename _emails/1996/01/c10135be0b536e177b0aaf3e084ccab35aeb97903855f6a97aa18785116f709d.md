Yeah, I know not according to them. Thats not what counts. I'd like to
know what a lawyer thinks. Once they have declared that something
doesn't fit the munitions criteria I suspect they are estopped from
ever claiming again that it is munitions -- basic legal
principle. Sure, they can claim otherwise, but they aren't forbidden
by law from asserting their power to make buildings levitate, either.

They can claim that they have the right to declare fingernail clippers
to be munitions, but that certainly couldn't stand up in court.
