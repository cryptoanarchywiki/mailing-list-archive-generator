depends.  prohibition was a failure.  information is much easier to
duplicate and conceal, spy thrillers aside.  many people find it hard
to justify information being dangerous, especially if it's something
innocuous like just another cryptosystem, or just another penis.

compare with software piracy.  when was the last time a kid in your
neighborhood was busted for unlicensed copying of software?  and
software is big business, lots of suits and $$$.  they can try to make
disassemblers illegal, but it's not likely to succeed.

in the Portland Oregon area, the price ranges from $234/year to
$1750/year for unlimited ppp access.  (I have no idea how long the
$234/year is going to stay in business.  that won't even cover the
cost of a phone line.)
