You could have remailers clamp down on multiple copies of the 
same message, but that is easily countered by convincing the
UseNet stupes to insert their e-mail address or something.


In general there is no way to prevent this kind of mail-bombing
without compromising anonymity.


By the way Alan--your message failed PGP verification.  
I received it by way of Bob Hettinga's "e$pam" list.  While
Hettinga gets double-plus good points for content, his
technical performance as a list operator is lacking.


Which is to say: the message might have gotten munged by the
"e$pam" list processor.
