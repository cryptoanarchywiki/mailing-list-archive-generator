Interesting term, similar to Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent" (which
obviously must've come later...).

Maybe I've from the old school, the school that says one should be more
modest, objective, and circumspect. Then, if it's really news, and not just
a PR scam, the journalists will come.

(Understand that I'm not saying I'm sort sort of paragon of modesty. Far
from it. But I try to control myself.)

I think that the view that "all news is hype" is overly harsh. In fact,
corrective forces tend to slow this headlong rush into P.R. For example,
the reaction here to the Nathaniel Borenstein/First Virtual hyperbole, and
the fatuous, credulous article by Simson Garfinkel (sorry, Simson, but I
call 'em as I see 'em), will undermine their credibility for a long time.
Crying wolf, and all that.

The FV "discovery" that insecure machines can cause all sorts of problems
rated at most a brief paragraph in the papers, not the full-page treatment
Garfinkel and his editors gave it in the "San Jose Mercury News" (and maybe
other papers that picked it up, or will in the next few weeks).

Newspapers and magazines that run "fluff" pieces, taken almost directly
from press releases, lose credibility. (Nathaniel B. claims that the Simson
G. piece ran _first_, before his Press Release. Well, how did Simson first
learn of the FV "discovery"? How did the FV President arrange to be
photographed? It seems pretty clear to me that FV was involved in the
development of the story, perhaps even planting the seed for it. Not
necessarily a dishonest thing to do, of course, just a bit tacky given that
the "discovery" is not news.

Nope. I think it a very poor model for getting information out. With all
due respect to Sameer, who has done many fine things, I gag every time I
see a press release from Community Connection in which Sameer interviews
himself.

Or, put another way:
