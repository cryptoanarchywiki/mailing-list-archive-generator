What?  You mean you LIKE to read TV guide every week, cover to cover, in 
advance, to scedule your TV viewing habits?

Aw, admit it.  You're just still pissed 'cause I called  you a f------ 
statist.  <G>>

Me, I'd like to be able to tell my "TV-Guide search engine" to:

1.   Look for this particular show or movie.
2.   Look for this particular star, director, or other participant..
3.   Follow a subject thread, say on the news.
4.   etc.

Maybe even a more complex (artificially intelligent) agent that "knows" me 
well enough to anticipate my desires.

You're entitled to NOT like it.  But I'm equally entitled to use modern 
technology to sift through 60+ cable channels, or 300+ DSS-type channels.
