Greetings All,

Firstly, if this is viewed as "Noise" rather than "Signal", please accept my apologies.

The matter at hand concerns my concern over my inability to check the "integrity" of a PGP windoze shell written by Michael R. Lyman at Aegis Research Corp.

I worry that since the shell has access to my secret ring that it might be sending it somewhere without my knowledge.  The freeware was, according to Mr.Lyman, developed "Project Manager, Forward Air Missile Defense, United States Army Missile Command".  That gvt. affiliation gives me considerable pause as regards back doors and other ways my secret ring and pass phrase could be compromised.

Does anyone have any familiarity with this freeware?  I do not think I am being paranoid.. just careful.  Lastly, if I am not a programmer, what sort of inspection can I perform on the software to make sure it is not "bugged"?

Thanks for your thoughts.... and sorry to have disturbed those who see this post as noise

Kind regards,
Michael E. Carboy
