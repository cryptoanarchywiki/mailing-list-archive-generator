To momentarily flog a dead horse, banning content only makes it more
desirable. Fortunately, the economic aspect doesn't seem to hold true
for now; i.e., when real world objects are banned, they become more
expensive to access (cf. the artificially inflated prices of heroin,
cocaine, LSD, etc). Information, OTOH, so far does not seem subject
to this cause-and-effect rule. Italics: So Far. The less regulated
and more diverse the net becomes, the more the relative prices for
commodities (disk space, CPU cycles, bandwidth) will accurately
reflect their "true" value at any given moment. Anyway, my original
point was just to remind everyone of what they should already know:
namely, that people may not care about not doing something until
they are told that they cannot, at which point they will move heaven
and earth to Do the Deed. Statists (and a lot of child psychologists)
call it "obstinate" or "defiant". ObAside: If you haven't yet, read
the latest DSM (the holy writ of the so-called "mental health"
profession). Ugly stuff. Who is allowed to define "normal"? Who profits
from the creation of such definitions and labelling of individuals?
