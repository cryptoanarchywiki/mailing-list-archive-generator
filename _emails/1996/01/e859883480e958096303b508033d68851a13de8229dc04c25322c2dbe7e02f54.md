Isn't that what Sameer announced in his latest(?) press release?
c2.org has a MT account.  c2.org customers don't.  The customers
receive ecash payments from the Net (for accessing their |<00|_ web pages)
and give the payments to c2.org, which deposits them in its MT acocunt,
and credits the customer (minus a percentage?  Lower than the customer
would otherwise get from MT, but higher than c2.org (a merchant) is charged?).
Did I get that right?
