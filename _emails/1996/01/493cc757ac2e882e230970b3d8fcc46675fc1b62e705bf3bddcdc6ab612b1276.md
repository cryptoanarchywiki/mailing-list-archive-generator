The number of people who drank booze when Prohibition began dwarfs the
number of people who want access to "controlled" information on the
net today.  Most people still don't even understand what the net is.
They're two completely different situations.  Also, the powers that be
have much better reasons for killing the net than they had for banning
booze.

Also, access to the net for Joe Average is still largely limited to
authoritarian giants like AOL (which forwards people's mail to the
FBI) and CompuServe (which bans hundreds of newsgroups).  Maybe these
companies will eventually be knocked out by small libertarian-minded
ISPs, maybe not.
