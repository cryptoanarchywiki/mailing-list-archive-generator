There hav been a lot of replies to the original
question, but I think a lot of people are missing
a simple solution.

You create a revocation certificate at the time
you create the key, and store it somewhere (I'd
recommend putting it on a floppy). Then either
give it to your lawyer, with a note saying "If I
forget the passphrase, give me back this", or
just write a note to yourself, and store it in a
place where you'll find it when the time comes.

It is inconvenient if a nasty third party finds it
while you were still using the key, but much less
damaging than if they found the password.

(Someone wrote that PGP doesn't support revocation
certificates. This is not correct.)
