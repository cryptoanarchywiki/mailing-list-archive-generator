First, this has been loosely confirmed for ages. Someone was mentioning that FBI offices 
supposedly have software that (on a 486) can crack a DES-1 key in under an hour. Multiply * 
modern high capacity computers = problem.  However, this does not nessesarily follow from 
#3. First off, you could probably tell the encryption used from a file format; the software 
on the other end has to know what it's getting. Secondly, you could probably tell quite a 
lot about what was used by some intense analysis.
Finally, if their software cannot read it and analysis suggested it was more than DES-1 
then they might go after someone w/o being able to read the document in question.

Not necessarily. This freemen issue shows that the FBI is getting gunshy about bad 
publicity, which they were getting.

Sounds like the old argument for encrypting everything...

What??? Now you're going to tell us X-Files is just a TV show? <g>
