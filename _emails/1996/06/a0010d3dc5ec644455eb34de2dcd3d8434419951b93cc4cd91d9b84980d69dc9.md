If you had heard the whole speech rather than only the portion reported on CNN
you would know that you have entirely distored the meaning. The point being
made was that cyberspace is being promoted as a panacea for all ills, many of
which it is creating rather than curing. Cyberspace is not a replacement for an
ecconomic policy, Newts idea of giving laptops to homeless people is not a
solution for poverty. Actually I think that this is quite obvious from the
quote you give.

Given the experience of derregulating Savings and Loans institutions I don't
think the country could survive another round of deregulation. As Reagan said
"Gentlemen we've hit the jackpot" - and of course they had, S&L was not a
fiasco for certain people, just for the poor taxpayers.

Damned unsporting eh? Isn't the NRA weapon of choice a surface to air missile?
