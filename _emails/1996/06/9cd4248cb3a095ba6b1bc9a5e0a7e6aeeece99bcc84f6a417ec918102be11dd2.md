As many of you can imagine, I am a fan of this site. Naturally,
I think the Whitehouse aide particularly wanted to squelch the
Mena information.

It strikes me as a sort of strange deja-vu that this bigger-than-
Watergate issue is so well covered-_UP_ by pretty-much every U.S.
media outlet except (oddly) the W$J, Penthouse, and "High Times,"
(a pot-oriented magazine). I guess that since Clinton is the most
Nixonian president since Nixon himself this should not surprise
me, and I should just expect Clinton's re-election, followed by
his resignation, as yet-another repeat-of-history. Expecting any
{partisan D.= Fiske, and then R.= Starr} "Independent" counsel to
open this can of hypocritical worms without constant prodding is
unrealistic, IMNSHO.

I just convinced their Webmaster, Mark Saltveit, to go get PGP.
I'm talking him through the wonders of using it now.

I have even convinced him to look for any dirt on the Libertarian
candidates (not terribly a difficult job in Mr. Schiff's case <g>).
