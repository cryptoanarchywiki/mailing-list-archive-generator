I haven't seen this particular idea, but a general point to always bear in
mind is that "entropy doesn't increase" (despite what you may have heard
about that other kind of entropy....).

To wit, if there are N bits of entropy in a passphrase (or whatever is the
basic key, be it typed in, read from a floppy, whatever), then no amount of
deterministic crunching by a PRNG (or whatever) will increase this.

(I say "deterministic" in the sense that all parties presumably need to run
the same PRNG and get the same output from the same "seed" (= passphrase,
in this scheme). Thus, the PRNG cannot add additional randomness or
entropy. Unless I am misunderstanding the proposal...)

So, if the passphrase is 22 characters, as in the "Safemail" proposal (such
as it is), that's all that can be gotten. Period. There just aren't enough
"places" in the space of starting points. Anyone with access to the
algorithms used to process the 22 characters (154 bits if 7 bits are used
for each character) can brute force search the space in a relatively short
time. (If the later processing algorithms are supposed to be "secret," then
of course this a cryptographic faux pas of the first magnitude, usually
dismissed as "security through obscurity.")

By the way, amongst other defects, "Safemail" is a pretty bad name for a
company, being that RSA Data Security has or had a product called
"MailSafe."

(The same thing happened with the Web search tool made by "Architext."
There was a Macintosh hypertext program with the same name, which I bought
in 1990. Someone I knew who worked for Architext was confused by my
denunciation of Architext....such name collisions make for interesting
situations.)
