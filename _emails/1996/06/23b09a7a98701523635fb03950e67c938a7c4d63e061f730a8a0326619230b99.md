    I think an old Doonesbury cartoon that had Duke (representing
    the NRA) testifying before a Senate subcommittee summed it up
    quite nicely.....

    Senator: "And we and the American people have had enough of you and
      your fanatic organization!"

    Duke: "I see Senator, shall I put you down for a million postcards?"

    Senator: "Don't you threaten me mister!"

    Politicians only understand one thing.
