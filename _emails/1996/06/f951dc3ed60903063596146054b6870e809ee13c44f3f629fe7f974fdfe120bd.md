Good point.

Any system with multi-valued or yes/no signatures becomes 
unresolvable in a web, making these values useless beyond an order or 
one or two levels.

We've argued about this before on the list...

Another interesting point, though: feature creep.  Something like 
that may be another intimidating factor that turns people off from 
PGP.
