I don't know of any modern chips that have "ceramic coatings." (Some chips,
esp. CPUs, are still ceramic-packaged, but in these cases the metal or
ceramic lids are easily removed.)

Most chips are plastic-packaged, and plasma ashers and/or chemical baths
will expose the chip surface easily enough.

Once exposed, various methods exist to read internal voltage levels. For
example, electron beams in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) can fairly
easily read at least surface potentials. Whether a SEM in voltage-contrast
mode can read voltages on lower levels depends on a lot of things, and I
can't even make a guess here as to whether OTP (one-time programmable)
memories from particular vendors can have internal nodes probed.

With enough money, many things are possible.
