Perry,

BTW, its not normally polite to post comments on personal mail to a 
list. I thought the list had probably got bored with this nonsense long
ago.

Being listed as staff in my view makes one a staff member. 

There have been interesting developments in telecommunications which
make it no longer necessary to physically reside where one works.

When I was a CERN fellow I was certainly on the payroll of CERN - 
generally that is what "Fellow" means.

If Perry wishes to call me a fool for calling a person listed by the Cato 
Institute as a member of their "staff" a member of the Cato institute staff then 
I guess Perry has a different deffinition of "fool";.



	Phill
