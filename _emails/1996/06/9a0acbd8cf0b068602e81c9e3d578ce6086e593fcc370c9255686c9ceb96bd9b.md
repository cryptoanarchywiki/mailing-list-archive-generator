Ooooooo, I'm *excited*!

My very own chance to meet Bruce Taylor, AKA "Penis with a Blister", AKA "PWAB",  AKA "The Toolman", AKA "The Labia Nailer".

I soooo excited, I just want to reach down right now and fondle my inner child. 

Maybe not. After all that fondling, I'd probably be to TiReD...

Feh.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
