Actually, perhaps you *should* check Webster's... you forget that I'm a
Certified Political Scientist. The etymology of fascism is particularly on
point. Historically, it refers to the building of a military vanguard as an
outgrowth of risorgimento, Italy's process of becoming a independent,
unified [fucking] state rather than a bunch of weak city-states, which were
often dominated by French, Prussian, or Austria-Hungarian interests.

In an interesting turn from the theme of this list, Italians from the 1870's
through Mussolini saw a strong, centralized state as the best way to be free
from tyranny and government theft. I'm not much of an historian of Italy,
though, so I won't pursue this point. Besides, it came from a peculiar set
of historical circumstances that CLEARLY do not apply to the US today.

Sounds like my kind of guy. I tend not to be much impressed by radio
personalities, but I may look him up.

"What is fascism" could be batted about forever; I don't think it's much
worth talking about, especially out of historical context. Mussolini started
as a Machiavellian who had not read Machiavelli. Early fascism, and the
etymology of fascism, was a nationalistic, militaristic struggle for power.
Once they got in power, then they started developing an economic ideology.
That's how it works with just about every "political theory"... with the
exceptions of Marxism, libertarianism, and religious fundamentalism,
perhaps.

Of "particular" ethnic groups, probably no. Ezra Pound's antisemitism was
actually pretty unusual. But fascism's essence is rabid, disciplined
nationalism of the militaristic kind. Not really xenophobic and explicitly
genocidal like "National Socialism," which isn't descriptive but was just a
name/party that Hitler was able to hijack to put his extended rant Mein
Kampf into practice, but definitely conscious of the "national character" to
the exclusion of any other.

That's one glimpse, but I think it's worthwile clarifying that corporatism
isn't about corporations. It's organizing societal groups into officially
recognized corps. Corporatism defines people by their profession, to the
exclusion of any other ties that bind (religion, family, hobbies, political
views, race -- cuz they're all assumed to be of the same "national
character" anyway) and all transactions among the various corps is mediated
by the government. An excellent example of corporatism is Mexico's PRI
(Institutional Revolutionary Party), which is essentially to say the Mexican
government, which is functionally divided into units such as the CTM
(Confederation of Mexican Workers, an umbrella for legally sanctioned trade
unions).
