Warren Buffett, the worlds greatest investor said---"buy a business, not a
stock" ---and--- "is the business simple and understandable?"  Some savvy
investors have made their fortune, or at least a lot of money by buying into
a company in it's early stages of development, before the general public
discovers it!  They have found and then invested in a company they believe
in and watched it grow over time.  Did you hear about Novell stock when it
was only $2.25 a share, or Xerox at 50 cents?  How about Wal-Mart, Telefono
de Mexico or Toys r Us?  Not likely, small or micro-cap stocks are almost
totally invisible until it's much too late for the average investor.  We
would like to send you information on a micro-cap company in its early
stages of development.  Simple business --- we refurbish AT&T telecom
equipment and sell it overseas to emerging third world economies such as
Belarus, Philippines, South America and Russia.  This stock is still trading
under $1 with very strong upside potential as the company develops its
customer base in the multi-billion dollar overseas telecom business.
Contact us today to have a free corporate profile on this exciting company
faxed or e-mailed to you. Please e-mail your request to: karri19@idt.liberty.com
