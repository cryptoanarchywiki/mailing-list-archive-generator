This Saturday, Turing Auditorium, Noon-5. Unrestricted Ethernet
connectivity (both thinnet and 10BaseT) will be available; email me for an
IP address. Turing Aud has a Mac and a PC on the Net connected to an 
EXCELLENT presentation system. If you have something you'd like to show 
off, this is the place, and we're still short on topics.

Graphical actualizations of ideas raised at the last meeting regarding 
crypto GUIs would be one way to use the space.

The agenda is rather slim... Hugh was working on it, but nobody seems to
have anything to say. If we get really desperate for ideas, I might end up
talking about what I've REALLY been doing for the last five months. Dave
Harman will probably miss this one, but he's still invited.

Long, anal form of the directions follows.

When:

 June 8th, Noon-5.

Where:

 Turing Auditorium, Stanford University. Directions and maps below.

Your Hosts:

 Hugh Daniels <hugh@toad.com>, speaker wrangler/emcee
 Rich Graves <llurch@networking.stanford.edu>, venue/den mother/fucking *

Amenities:

 * Seating for 100 (should be enough)
 * Plenty of white boards
 * Air conditioning
 * High-end Mac and Windoze PC on the Internet, both hard-wired into an
   EXCELLENT projection system, 800x600x16-bit or so
 * Open 10Base2 and 10BaseT Ethernet drops for your laptop, no firewall to
   Net; email rich@c2.org for IP address
 * One analog phone
 * NO munchies within 5 minutes' walk, but Rich will bring bagels
 * NO plugging your own laptops into the projection system; however, the
   Mac will have an X server and, of course, web clients

Dinner:

 Fanny & Alexander's? Or Jing Jing again?

Directions:

 If you have a GPS receiver, head for 37.4296875N 122.1783752E.

 If you have excellent hearing, call 415-853-9080 and follow the ringing.

 Or, get to Stanford's Campus Drive via 280-Sand Hill or 101-El Camino
 Real-Embarcadero. From 280, take Campus Drive left (clockwise). From 101,
 take Campus Drive right (counterclockwise). Turn South (centripetal) at
 Panama Street and take an immediate left into the Jordan Quad parking lot
 (empty on weekends). Walk between Pine and Redwood Halls to Polya. 
 Turing is between Polya and Cypress. It doesn't appear on most campus
 maps, but it's there, honest. Entrance to Turing Auditorium is by the
 Pac Bell payphone sign.

Socialized transportation:

 CalTrain to the Palo Alto station; 20-minute walk or arrange to be picked
 up by a local. 7F bus. See http://www.stanford.edu/group/Transportation/
