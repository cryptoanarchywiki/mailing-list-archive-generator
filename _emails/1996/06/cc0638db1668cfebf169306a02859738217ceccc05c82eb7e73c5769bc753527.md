Hello there everyone subscribing to this mailing list...
My name is Benjamin Grosman and I am a 17 year old student from Sydney,
Australia...but please, don't hold any of that against me :)

Anyway, for my major assignment I wrote an encryption program under Turbo
Pascal for Dos, version 7.0, and for this program I developed the algorithm
myself...
Now, what I am wodnering is, is there anyone on this list who might be
interested in testing my program, and or analyisng the strength of the
encryption and reporting there findings back to me? The more people who are
knowledgeable in the field of encryption who want to have a look, the
better, so please, don't hesitate, as I would really appreciate all input....

As you all might have guessed, I am definitely pro-encryption. I have some
particularly malicious "friends" who go to great pains to find out what you
typed in your latest assignments...before they are due...and so I have
undertaken this project out of necessity as much as interest, and I find the
US governments ban on the exportation of cypher technology and knowledge a
great burden on the academic community in their efforts to further their
knowledge...but please don't sledge me for my views, just please respond to:
bgrosman@healey.com.au if you are interested in obtaining a copy of my
program...

Many thanks....
Ben
