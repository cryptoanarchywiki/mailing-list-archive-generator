How exactly would this be done? Since messages from alpha.c2.org
are conventionally encrypted, they don't contain key id's. 

Wouldn't that require every recipient to store his/her passphrase
and call pgp for every message to see if it could be decrypted? This in
and of itself would be a more serious security breach, not to mention an 
_enormous_ drain on site resources.
