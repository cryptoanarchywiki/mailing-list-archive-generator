As usual you display profound ignorance of history and politics.

Far from being an ahistorical myth, this is an entirely accurate description
of fascist ideology:  Or do you claim that Mussolini, Peron, etc, were not 
fascists?  Mussolini was the one who coined the name fascism.  The theory and
ideology of fascism was developed by the philosopher Giovanni Gentile, and 
there is nothing particularly racist or right wing about either Gentile or
Mussolini.

Fascism is not Republicanism on steriods, nor is it racism.  Fascism is 
basically romanticism plus socialism plus nationalism.
