You are free to use the word "wizard" provided that they look, feel,
and work much like what Microsoft calls a "wizard" -- see the 
Microsoft UI guidelines.  

This demand by Microsoft is pretty reasonable.  Now if it had been Apple
or lotus they probably would have declared that you could not write 
anything that looked, felt, or worked much like a wizard.
