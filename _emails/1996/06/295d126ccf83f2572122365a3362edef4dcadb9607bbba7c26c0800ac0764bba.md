   Three feathers for spying technology: 
 
   TST: "MI6 stole secrets from French navy." 
 
      Top secret technology for tracking nuclear submarines 
      has been stolen from a French naval base by MI6, 
      Britain's foreign intelligence service, after a French 
      civilian engineer was paid thousands of pounds to betray 
      one of his country's most closely guarded secrets to an 
      MI6 front company which posed as a technical defence 
      consultancy and publishing house. 
 
   TST: "High-flying gliders replace satellites." 
 
      Solar powered gliders circling above cities could 
      provide a cheap alternative to satellites for global 
      communication systems, according to a group of American 
      scientists. 
 
   WaJo: "Israel Asks White House to Place Curbs On 3 U.S. 
   Satellite-Surveillance Firms." 
 
      The request is regarded as "very sensitive," according 
      to one U.S. official, because Israeli officials say it 
      relates to their national security concerns. However, 
      officials of the affected U.S. companies charge it 
      amounts to unfair competition because an Israeli company 
      is about to enter the space surveillance business and it 
      wouldn't face similar restrictions.
