Most people I have encountered don't use PGP because of the initial
learning curve, more than the overall ease of use.  I work in a small
office that is separate from corporate HQ.  I have been trying for over a
year to convince people to use PGP for intra-office communication.  What I
have found is that for people within the office, it is fairly easy -
hands-on instruction works well.  Convincing folks at HQ has been a royal
pain however.  Most of the problem appears to be the "you mean I have to
learn new software?" variety.  Once I have coached someone over the
"knowledge hump" (often by phone), they tell me that using pgp is pretty
easy.  <disclaimer> We use Eudora Light for the Mac, YMMV </disclaimer>. 
The trick is convincing the user that the benefits associated with using
pgp are greater than the initial pain.  This is something I have only
accomplished with a few people.  

This educational process will continue to be the stumbling block for
widespread use until there is truly seamless encryption.  My fear is that
seamless encryption will be weak; witness the widespread use of 40bit
Netscape and the supposedly 40bit default behavior for S/MIME.  I think
that export controls are a driver towards weak defaults.

OK, that last part was a WA tangent from my "ease of using pgp" thread. 
It's late and I'm hungry.  Sue me.

	Later,
	Clay
