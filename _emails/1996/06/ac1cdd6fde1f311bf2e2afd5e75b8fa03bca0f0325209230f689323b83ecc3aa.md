It is in fact not at odds with what Clinton said. In fact, Clinton did
not have to go out and defend the law's constitutionality in an official
statement.

He could have just said "my attorneys in the DoJ are reviewing the
opinion and will make a decision to appeal or not within the time given
by law."
