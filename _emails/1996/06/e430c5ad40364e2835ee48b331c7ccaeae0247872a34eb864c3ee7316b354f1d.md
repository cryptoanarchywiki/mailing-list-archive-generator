I've wondered the same thing about gun control efforts. Who are they worried about? 
Criminals. By definition, what is a criminal? One who breaks the laws.  Are they seriously 
thinking that a) criminals might stop doing things because they are illegal? (For shame - I 
was going to use PGP to protect my child pornography sources. Good thing I found out it was 
illegal before I did that!) and b) criminals would not be able to buy programmers/etc to 
secure *their* privacy if they felt it was needed?
