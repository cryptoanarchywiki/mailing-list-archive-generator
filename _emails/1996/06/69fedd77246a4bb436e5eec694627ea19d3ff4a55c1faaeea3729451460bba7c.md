Perry, 

	for a person who is picking nits you are getting rather too many wrong:
Fortunately you are now arguing in a region where I can give authoratative 
sources online.

I had missed the Jr bit, but Hess Sr is somewhat better known.

Wrong, try visitng the Cato Institute's site:

http://www.cato.org/people.html

You can find his papers at:

http://www.cato.org/pa-234es.html


Of course the Cato Institute may have simply added him to their "staff" list to 
make them look more important but I doubt it. 

The piece is not particularly original, Cadilac Desert made the same points in 
the early 80s. On the other hand it is a briefing paper intended to influence 
legislation so thats not suprising. Federal subsidies of water and farmland have 
turned into corporate handouts. This is hardly suprising given the mechanism. 

The farmers want to get a freebie handout while pretending that they are not on 
welfare. This leads to a mechanism which is attempting socialist policies 
without admitting that they are socialist, the handouts have to be disguised  
resulting in far more waste than if an intellectually honest policy were 
followed. In the EU there is a similar system of corrupt price support for 
agriculture, mainly supported by the French. 

I don't know of any serious political movement which supports such policies 
except for farmers advocates which does not recognise them as pork barrel.
