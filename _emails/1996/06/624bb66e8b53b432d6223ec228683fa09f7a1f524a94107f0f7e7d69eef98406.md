On thinking about your rant, I think you have a valid point.  What our
venture capitalists said to us was, "There is no market for security."  Now
perhaps the ITAR helps suppress that market on the basis of, "If I'm going
to have to wander the information superhighway naked, why should I shut the
blinds on my house."  Given no market, and the requirement to support
everything you ever supported, it is hard to justify building in security
features.

I have a client who provides services to part of the DOD.  (My contract
prevents me from being more specific.)  Their only saving grace is they
don't use the Internet or Unix.  (Making them vulnerable to a much smaller
group of hackers.)

The ideal situation for them would be to use public key authentication
because it would be entirely user-transparent.  Doing OTP's the way Apple
does them (see below) would also work well.  However, to implement one of
these systems requires modifying a bunch of terminal emulator programs from
different vendors (some of whom are no longer in business).  Without widely
adopted standards for OTP logon, these modifications are not likely to
happen.

I think that backward compatibility requirements are a significant part of
the reason we see this problem.  The other part is, of course, that there
is no market for security.

Apple has a form of one time passwords in their file sharing system.  When
you enter your password, it is used as a key to encrypt a challenge sent by
the file server (Using a symmetric cypher).  The result is returned,
decrypted and compared with the original challenge.  But this system didn't
have to be compatible with a hardware VT100 or TTY-33.

The problem, in general, isn't the system administrators.  If management
gave the same priority to security that it does to joining new users or
installing new hardware, sysadmins would have the time to install the
patches.  Most sysadmins are up to their asses in alligators.  Security is
something to put off.  If the managers were judged on the security of their
systems (perhaps via independent audit), then they might give the problem
some priority.
