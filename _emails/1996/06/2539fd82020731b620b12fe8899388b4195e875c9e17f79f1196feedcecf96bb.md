 Hmmm... I'm going to have to play around with this. I can get outbound
email access 
through my school district's mailserver simply by filling in the
appropriate fields in 
netscape (we have a WAN hooked up to a T1).  It would seem to me that
this would be rather 
secure for several reasons, if for no other than that NO logging is
made... In a large 
district, like mine (probably 10-15 thousand potential users), I doubt
they would have the 
resources to track any of the 100 or so Internet machines on my campus
alone, even if they 
could tell it came from here.
