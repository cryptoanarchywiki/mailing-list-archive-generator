Well I am now using a PC, I use a MAc for programming and both for
networking& the internet. So as usual I am plastered as a 13 year old
"computer illiterate" thanks real big confidence booster. I love my pc & my
mac, I also love my Apple II it showed me the way of programming (first with
basic), now I program in C and C++. Oh yea I guess I'm still computer
illiterate.
