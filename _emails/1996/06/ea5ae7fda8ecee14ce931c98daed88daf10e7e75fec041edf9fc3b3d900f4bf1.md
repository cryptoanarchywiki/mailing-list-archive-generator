In 1996, the Libertarian Party will apparently qualify for Federal matching
>>>funds for its Presidential political campaign.  That does not mean that it
>>>will _accept_ them, being stolen goods.  However, a few years ago I heard of
>>>an idea that they should accept the money, and return it to the people, a
>>>small amount at a time, to whomever asks for it.  Besides returning the
>>>stolen money to its rightful owners, that would produce substantial positive
>>>publicity for the Libertarian party, embarrassment for the Democrats and
>>>Republicans, while at the same time reducing the amount of money available
>>>for the D's and the R's.

You can buy a helluva lot more publicity with the matching funds.  I'm not
advocating this, just pointing it out.
