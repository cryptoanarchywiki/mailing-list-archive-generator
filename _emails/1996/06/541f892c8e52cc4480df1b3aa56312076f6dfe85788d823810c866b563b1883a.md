many banks in the area.  It is all done through land lines and is not 
very well protected.  They aren't very careful about who or what they 
let into the building also.  If someone were to cut the lines the banks 
in the area would be out for days and they wouldn't have a means to do 
interbank transactions outside of the immediate area.  Has anyone else 
seen this in there area or heard of it. Wouldn't it be a better idea to 
do the transactions by satellite.

Very vulnerable to jamming.
