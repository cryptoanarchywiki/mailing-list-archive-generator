I don't mean to be overly critical, but why not provide for the possibility 
of longer keys?  The RSA key only has to be exchanged and decoded once per 
call, presumably, which suggests that there shouldn't be a problem to do 
2048-bit keys.  Admittedly, 1024 bits will be good for many years, but...

I sure do wish they'd get things like this a bit more accurate...  Oh, well, 
I suppose it doesn't really matter...
