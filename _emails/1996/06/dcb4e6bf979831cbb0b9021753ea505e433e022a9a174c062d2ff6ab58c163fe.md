I've seen some legal arguments that an email message that reads 
"Bob, Sounds good--it's a deal. --Alice" can in some circumstances be 
as binding as an oral contract or a scribbled note, which is not 
meaningless though not as strong as a legal signed contract. As long 
as one can show Alice *did* write that, that it referred to a 
specific deal, etc. etc., it holds some legal weight.

But I'm no lawyer, and one should never trust legal advice form 
Usenet or the c'punks list.

Rob.
