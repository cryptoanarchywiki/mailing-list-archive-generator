Computer Encyclopedia & Computer Accessories are the fastest growing 
destinations on CCI.  If you haven't checked 'em out yet, see why others 
flock there. You can download a free WebPhone and browse the Computer 
Encyclopedia at 
http://www.currents.net/market/accessories/accessories.html 


Check out the Members' Gallery and follow the path to creating your own
space on the web -- free.  Also create an on-line Resume and be a part of
the CCI Members' Talent Bank.  Both pages are freely accessible by other 
CCI Members and the outside world alike (follow the instructions when creating
your page(s) to obtain your personal URL).

1996 show schedule for CCI.  Stop by our booth and let us know 
how we're doing:

Used or refurbished equipment could be the way to go, especially 
considering how fast the technology changes.  Look for a new 
used/refurbished equipment buying service here in a few weeks.



Ten people will be selected at random from those who complete the ISP 
survey to win the top-rated DeskPorte 28.8S external modem from Microcom. 
Plus, you'll get the warm fuzzies knowing you helped us inform others 
about who's performing up to snuff, and who isn't.
