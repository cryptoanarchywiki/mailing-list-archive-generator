Yup, NeXT did this with their "For Your Eyes Only" demo and the crypto  
extensions for their Mail application.  Although NeXT used an algorithm  
called "FEE" (Fast Elpitic Encryption), you can do it with RSA by hashing the  
passphrase, seeding a random number generator, generating a random prime,  
etc...  It works but it adds a lot of processing time to encryption and  
decryption.

There are other, more serious, drawbacks to such a scheme though.  You can't  
change your passphrase without changing your public key.  People can try to  
guess your passphrase with only your public key.  Crack can guess peoples  
account passwords something like 24% of the time.  I doubt the average joe  
would use much better passphrases for their secret key.  That's a scary  
thought!!  At least with PGP someone has to get a copy of the encrypted  
secret key first.


One interesting thing about NeXT's software is that the Mail application has  
crypto hooks.  The crypto code is in a drop-in bundle that extends the app  
at runtime.  This isn't just a generic interface, but the internationally  
shipped Mail software calls methods in the external bundle that are  
definitely crypto related.  Also, much of the crypto and key management user  
interface ships with the main Mail package.  It is hidden without the crypto  
bundle, but if you peek around with InterfaceBuilder you can see that it is  
there.
