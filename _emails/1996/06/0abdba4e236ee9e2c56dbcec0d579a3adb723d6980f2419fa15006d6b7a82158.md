Guys,

1. A colleague of mine was interseted in in demonstrating the unix password
cracking program Crack on a windoze system. Where can one be found if one
exists?

2. If you were looking to compare single key block ciphers like Blowfish,
DES, 3xDES etc. Which one would be considered the best for implementation in
a software security package, assuming maximal key lengths irreverant of the
governmental restrictions.

3. Does anyone have info re: S/MIME implementation time table into the
Netscape browser?

Thanks
SO
