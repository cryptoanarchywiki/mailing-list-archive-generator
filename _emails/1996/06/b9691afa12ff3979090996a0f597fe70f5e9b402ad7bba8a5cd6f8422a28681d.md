ABSTRACT
WhoWhere? is the largest directory of personal and corporate
phone numbers, physical addresses and e-mail addresses on the
Internet.  As the Net rapidly evolves, defines and redefines
itself, WhoWhere? provides a worldwide collection of fundamental
information which serves both individual and business
communication needs.  It has become the Global White Pages and
enables people to locate others around the world, whether they
are on or off the Net. Gunjan Sinha will share the challenges
associated with building and maintaining this type of directory
and the ways in which it can be utilized.

BIO

of video servers at Olivetti Advanced Technology, where he
developed interactive video servers. He was also involved with
multiprocessor and distributed server development. Earlier is his

network license management company, which was later acquired by
Central Designs Systems Inc. Sinha holds a Masters in Engineering
Management from Stanford University, and a Masters in Computer
Engineering from the University of California at Santa Cruz.
