If the plaintext is ASCII text, the time is the same but the machine is a
little more expensive.  What you do is process 8 or more blocks of
ciphertext in parallel, matching the high order bit of each byte to 0.
With 8 blocks, you get 64 high order bits -- more than the number of key
bits -- so you're not likely to guess wrong.

If the signal is audio instead of text, I don't know what you look for.
That depends on the compression algorithm.

If the signal is compressed text, again I would need to see the comressor
output.

If all you have is one or two blocks of text (e.g., a bank transaction) you
decrypt and decide whether the result is just impossible.  If it's possible
(and there will be many) you send the trial key on to a second processor (a
more general one) to try that key on the whole message to decide if the
message is still possible.

If that processor likes a given key, you send the result to a human -- who
chooses among all the possibles.

In other words, this doesn't have to be one-step-to-success.  All you're
doing is pruning the keyspace to something more manageable.
