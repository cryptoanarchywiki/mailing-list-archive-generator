No, not okay.

The resulting torrent of messages from and to Tonie Nathan, and about Tonie
Nathan, had no connection to anything related to the CP list.

I didn't single you out as the instigator of the cross-copying, as I had no
idea of who it was.... (but now that I know it was you, I can't really say
I'm surprised).

When messages are cross-copied, warning should be included saying that the
message is going to more than one mailing list, and perhaps why this was
deemed necessary. And most importantly, urging follow-up posts to carefull
consider which groups are appropriate.

(Many people don't even bother to edit the To: and Cc: fields, resulting in
a pile-up of copied names. I try to excise out all recipients except
"cypherpunks@toad.com," figuring anyone not reading the list is not worth
sending a separate copy to.)
