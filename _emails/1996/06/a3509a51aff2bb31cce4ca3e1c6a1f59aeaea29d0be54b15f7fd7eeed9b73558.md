   "Judges Turn Back Law To Regulate Internet Decency." 
 
      In a unanimous decision that celebrated the Internet as 
      "the most participatory marketplace of mass speech that 
      this country -- and indeed the world -- has yet seen," 
      a three-judge Federal panel in Philadelphia yesterday 
      declared unconstitutional major parts of a new law 
      intended to regulate indecent material on the global 
      computer network and blocked the law's enforcement. 
 
      The three judges called Government attempts to regulate 
      content on the Internet a "profoundly repugnant" affront 
      to the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. 
 
      "Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the 
      strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and 
      cacophony of the unfettered speech the First Amendment 
      protects," Judge Dalzell wrote.
