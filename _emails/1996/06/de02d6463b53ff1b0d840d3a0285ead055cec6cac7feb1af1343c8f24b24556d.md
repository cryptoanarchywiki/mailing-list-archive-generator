      Tim ,
          You should stick to your own religion and not criticize other 
peoples. It is unforunate that the esteem that I once felt for you is 
dwindling because of your anti-Mormon trash. Perhaps you do not realise 
that some people take more than an academic interest in their religion 
;this is unforunate . It is pitiful.You are becomeing the ugly 
American that foreigners hate; always having an opinion about everything.
