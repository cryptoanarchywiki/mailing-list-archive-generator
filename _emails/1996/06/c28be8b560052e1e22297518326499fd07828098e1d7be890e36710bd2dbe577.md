I wasn't aware of any ills being created by cyberspace.  For one thing, it
hasn't been around (as a big thing) long enough.  The only impact it has had
so far is to reduce TV watching and improve writing ability (from a very low
base level) among its heavy users.  That's a good thing.  Any effects of
disintermediation or shrinking of institutions (governments and
corporations) as we discuss on this list haven't really happened yet.

I assume that Clinton's statement was aimed at the neo-Luddites in the
AFSCME.  There are probably quite a few.  Actually freedom of communications
or free exchange of bits (cyberspace) and by analogy the free exchange of
goods and services *are* an economic policy though of course a controversial
one.

Yes the great inventor of deposit insurance FDR has a lot to answer for.
But for his intervention, we taxpayers wouldn't have owed a dime for the S&L
collapse.

I expect quite a bit more de facto dereg as people become harder to control.
A mere desire to regulate others unaccompanied by the ability to do so is so
much noise.

The NRA suggests shotguns.  A rifle is much more sporting than a shotgun for
assassinating quackers.  Hard to hit them with rifles (even harder with SAMs).
