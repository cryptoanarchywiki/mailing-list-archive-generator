Instructions for Web access to the NRC report, "Cryptography's Role in
Securing the Information Society," May 30, 1996, Prepublication Copy, are
at: 
 
 
     http://pwp.usa.pipeline.com/~jya/nrc.txt 
 
 
Appendices A to N are now in individual files. 
 
 
A few typos have been corrected in nrc00.txt and nrc06.txt. 
 
 
For the coder, mathematician and avid proofreader, we'll JPEG and forward
any page that contains equations -- such as those in Appendix C.
