The Systemics Cryptix crypto library for Perl is now available for
download at http://www.systemics.com/software/

Apart from much tidying up, there have been several signigicant additions
to the library, include a Blowfish implementation, RSA encryption
(including key generation routines), CFB and CBC block cipher mode modules,
and a cryptographically secure random stream generator.

This library is not currently on CPAN, since several modules are not
in a suitable state for CPAN distribution.  However, if anyone can
rectify this, then we are happy to place them on CPAN.

Enjoy!

P.S. - PGP library on it's way soon (hopefully this weekend!)



                        CRYPTIX LIBRARY FOR PERL (V1.1)
                                       
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Description

   This library contains a suite of cryptographic and mathematical
   modules for Perl. Many of the more CPU intensive algorithms have been
   implemented in C as Perl extensions.
   
Features

  Perl extensions
  
   All of the following have been implemented as Perl extensions in C:

     * Crypt::Blowfish module (Blowfish implementation by A.M. Kuchling).
     * Crypt::DES module (DES implementation by Eric Young).
     * Crypt::IDEA module.
     * Crypt::MD5 module (based on an implementation by Neil Winton and
       Data Security, Inc.)
     * Crypt::SHA module (based on an implementation by Uwe Hollerbach
       and based on code from NIST and Peter C. Gutmann)
     * Math::BigInteger module (based on code from Eric Young).
       This module implements arbitrary length integers and some
       associated mathematical functions.
     * Math::PRSG - Pseudo random sequence generator
       This module implements a 160 bit LFSR for use in generating pseudo
       random sequences.
     * Math::TrulyRandom module, based on code from Don Mitchell and Matt
       Blaze (AT&T).
       This module generates "truly random" numbers, based on interrupt
       timing discrepancies.
       
Perl modules

   All of the following have been implemented in Perl:

     * Crypt::CBC module
       This module implements CBC block cipher mode.
     * Crypt::CFB module
       This module implements CFB block cipher mode.
     * Crypt::CSRandomStream module
       This module implements a cryptographically secure random stream.
       It implements the Stream::DataInput interface.
     * Crypt::DES3EDE module
       This module implements triple DES (EDE mode).
     * Crypt::HashMD5
       This module implements an MD5 hash, which derives from
       Crypt::MessageDigest.
     * Crypt::HashSHA
       This module implements an SHA hash, which derives from
       Crypt::MessageDigest.
     * Crypt::MessageDigest
       This module implements the Crypt::MessageDigest base class.
     * Crypt::RSAKey
       This module implements the RSA key base class.
     * Crypt::RSAKeyGen
       This module is used for the generation of RSA key pairs.
     * Crypt::RSAPublicKey
       This module implements an RSA public key, which derives from
       Crypt::RSAKey.
     * Crypt::RSASecretKeyPair
       This module implements an RSA public/secret key pair, which
       derives from Crypt::RSAKey.
     * Math::MPI module
       This module implements the reading and writing of Philip
       Zimmermans MPI format large integers.
     * Math::PseudoRandomStream module
       This module implements a pseudo random data stream. It implements
       the Stream::DataInput interface.
     * Math::Random module
       This module contains a collection of various random number
       routines.
     * Math::TestPrime module
       This module is used to test the primality of an instance of
       Math::BigInteger.
     * Stream::DataEncoding
     * Stream::DataInput
     * Stream::DataOutput
     * Stream::FileInput
     * Stream::FileOutput
     * Stream::Streamable
     * Stream::StringInput
     * Stream::StringOutput
