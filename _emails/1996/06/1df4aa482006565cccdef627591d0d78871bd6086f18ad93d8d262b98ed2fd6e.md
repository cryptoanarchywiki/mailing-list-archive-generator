President Clinton is scheduled to video-tape his testimony in
the second Whitewater trial.  He will do so from the oval office
in July.  The first video taped testimony he sent to an Arkansas
court room was scrambled in order to protect his personal and
political privacy.  One can only assume that the President will
also encrypt his second testimony for the same reasons.  I have
no problem with the President exercising his rights to use
encryption.  That is what the defensive technology is for.
However, President Clinton is also engaged in an effort to
deny that very same right from ordinary citizens.

The Clinton administration has tried for several years to ban or
remove all defensive encryption security from computers,
stressing that crime had a higher priority over privacy.  His
latest Clipper III proposal would require all U.S. citizens to
turn over their keys (escrow) so that the FBI can ensure that no
one is using their computer for criminal activities.  In effect,
the proposal would invalidate the First, Fourth and Fifth
amendments.  Escrow is the modern equal to the FBI demanding
your house key.  This is so the FBI can check in every now and
then.  Yet, instead of making life safer, the proposal will
leave us wide open for hacker attack.

It is a fact that the Clinton record of computer security is so
poor that the GAO reported over 160,000 successful penetrations
against just the Defense Department in 1995.  In fact, during
one incident, a 16 year old hacker could have started a war
between North Korea and America (Rome NY USAF Base/Korean Atomic
Research Facility 1995). Please note - DOD has the best computer
security record of all government agencies!  That means the
situation at the FBI, BATF, FAA, HUD and IRS is worse.  Much
worse.  The computers that control the military, financial,
industrial, medical and political heart of America are waiting
for a Digital Pearl Harbor, left undefended by Presidental
order.  His proposal also assumes that a huge bureaucracy
erected to monitor escrowed keys would be more secure than our
nuclear arsenal.  Ridiculous.

President Clinton has risked global nuclear war to push
intrusive and obsolete ideas which protect nothing.  Instead,
President Clinton should heed the GAO report which concluded
that securing million dollar military computers with no
encryption software, no firewalls and untrained, part-timers, is
the wrong thing to do.  President Clinton demands his personal
and legal privacy but refuses to support the same for you and
me.  President Clinton has risked our personal safety and our
common democracy in order to create a large bureaucracy of
lawyers who will do nothing but count bits.  The President
should take a lesson from his own actions, cipher thyself, and
protect America.  He should join Senator Bob Dole and a whole
crowd of Bi-partisan elected officals in supporting the PROCODE
bill (S. 1726).  This bill gives every American the right to
encrypt.  The right to personal privacy.  The same right Bill
Clinton enjoyed during the last video session at the Whitehouse.
