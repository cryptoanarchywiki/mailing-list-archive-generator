>        (SUN/PSI-INTL)(SUNW) PSI International, Sun partner, unveils Java-

>        
>        Highlights:
>            -- Internet in Blue, one of the first Java-based solutions aimed
>        at fighting crime, is being introduced by PSI International, a
>        strategic partner of Sun Microsystems Federal, and includes other
>        Sun products.  
>        
>            -- Internet in Blue combines the power of Java and Netra servers
>        to enable law enforcement agencies and police departments to quickly
>        leverage the capabilities of the Internet and intranets.  
>        
>            -- This solution is the latest evidence of Sun taking advantage
>        of the significant market opportunity for crime prevention
>        technology.  Last year, Sun Federal announced a dedicated Criminal
>        Justice Operation, which is working with police departments and law
>        enforcement agencies around the world to help them use technology in
>        fighting crime.  
>        
>            MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- May 20, 1996--One of
>        the first Sun(TM) Java(TM)-based solutions aimed at fighting crime
>        was introduced today by PSI International, a strategic partner of
>        Sun Microsystems Federal, a subsidiary of Sun Microsystems, Inc.  
>        
>            Called Internet in Blue(TM), the solution combines the power of
>        Sun's Java technology, its Netra(TM) Internet servers, its Java
>        WorkShop(TM) development tools, and PSI's relational database
>        software. This solution fully leverages the capabilities of the
>        Internet for the benefit of law enforcement agencies because of the
>        inclusion of Java, the revolutionary Internet platform from Sun that
>        makes possible fast, easy, operating-system-independent use of the
>        Internet.  
>        
>            To be offered by PSI, Internet in Blue will enable police
>        departments and other law enforcement agencies to leverage the
>        latest Internet technology to fight crime and promote citizen
>        involvement and community-based policing.  From a citizen's
>        perspective, having a local police force with an Internet presence
>        gives people the opportunity to report problems online and play a
>        more active role in fighting crime in their neighborhoods.  
>        
>            Besides utilizing the Internet, the PSI solution also allows
>        local police to build an "intranet," which is a greatly enhanced
>        internal information network to handle departmental processes as
>        well as to speedily access any internal database of interest.
>        Examples of these databases include local crime data such as
>        patterns of crimes, gang affiliations, data on previous suspects and
>        arrests.  Currently, many police departments must locate such data
>        via a paper trail, which is very inefficient.  
>        
>            "Law enforcement agencies are quickly realizing the power of the
>        Internet and intranets as strategic tools in fighting crime," said
>        John Marselle, president of Sun Microsystems Federal.  "The Internet
>        in Blue solution from PSI -- based on Sun technology -- takes
>        advantage of Java's security features, platform independence and
>        database access capabilities.  It should make it much easier for
>        police departments and other criminal justice organizations to get
>        online and to leverage the capabilities of the network."  
>        
>            With Java WorkShop, a visual development environment for Java
>        that can be included as part of the Internet in Blue solution,
>        police departments can design, test, deploy and maintain Internet
>        and intranet applications based on Java with speed and simplicity.
>        Java WorkShop runs on the Sun Solaris(TM) environment and Windows
>        95/NT.  Using Java, the PSIBase relational database management
>        system can access Web browsers across any hardware platform.  
>        
>            "The Internet is the next frontier in the development of law
>        enforcement information systems," said Paul Wormeli, program
>        director for law enforcement at PSI.  "Our Internet in Blue solution
>        will enable law enforcement agencies to quickly exploit the latest
>        technologies like Java."  
>        
>        Internet in Blue includes the following:
>        
>            A starter kit with a Sun Netra Internet server and PSI software
>        and services needed to set up a site on the World Wide Web, as well
>        as technical assistance from PSI for developing content and training
>        for a Webmaster.  
>        
>            A full set of applications to create a police intranet providing
>        secure internal access to selected crime information, standard
>        operating police procedures and other infrastructure services.  
>        
>            An interactive, community-based communications medium to
>        facilitate crime reporting over the Internet and community-based
>        policing.  
>        
>            Suggestions for services that law enforcement agencies can
>        develop in order to offset the cost of the Internet project, such as
>        providing online crime reports and accident report information to
>        authorized outside organizations including legal firms and insurance
>        companies.  -0-
