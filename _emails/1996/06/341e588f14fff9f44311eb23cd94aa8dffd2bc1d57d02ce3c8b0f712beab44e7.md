Hey, folks, I'm a libertarian, and even voted for John Hospers in 1972. But
the Cypherpunks mailing list has over 1200 subscribers, and cross-copying
to it for these debates is not a good idea. I presume the same is true
about cross-copying Cypherpunks stuff onto "nwlibertarians@teleport.co,"
but I can't say for sure.

What I know is that wide cross-posting (or cross-copying) is the bane of
lists these days. There are so many lists, so much overlap, that the
temptation is great to cc: any conceivably-related list.

Hey, no one speaks for Cypherpunks, least of all me, but I think
cross-copying between libertarian, or digital commerce, or Wobbly, or
International Socialist Women of Color, or Unabomber Brigade mailing lists
to the Cypherpunks list is inappropriate.
