06/27/96 VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKING ADVANCES

PAGE: 1C 

NEC Technologies' Internet Business Unit has successfully demonstrated
country-to-country virtual private networking during several tests
performed in early June between the San Jose unit and its counterpart
in Tokyo. Virtual private networking promises a secure and
cost-effective alternative to privately leased lines. Most connections
across the Internet are not encrypted and information exchanged is
vulnerable to snoopers. In a virtual private network, encryption is
used to scramble the data.
