Dear Sir,

I  am researching the topic of rent seeking in government and could make
good use of your "Big Brother" database. From press reports I've heard it
contains payment records and invoiced items for political transactions.
This should enable me to calculate  prices and inflation rates for
ambassadorships etc.

If it's not too much trouble could you email me a copy of the 20,000 name
database before my thesis is due?

P.S. Please give me the "FBI clean" version, I don't need the really
dangerous bits.
