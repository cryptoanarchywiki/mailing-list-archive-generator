if you get the opportunity, check out the beyond 2000, nextstep and invention shows on the discovery channel. albeit, they may be a bit dated, the stuff is often enlightening. tuit, r&d of stunguns, dazzlers, flypaper, tanglers and lo-grade chemical agents has been underway for some time in labs arouns the world. lethality is not as popular as it once was. some of these devices do, however, work through excruciating, if nondamaging, pain.
