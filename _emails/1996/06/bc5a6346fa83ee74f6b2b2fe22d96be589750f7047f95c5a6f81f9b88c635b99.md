I'll add a few comments about the "Java hype monster"... it seems a 
good way for people to make money off of computing in ways they 
haven't before (and in ways which probably won't work anyhow).

A lot of the Java hype has been how one only needs a "network 
appliance" that logs in and uses remote applets which are instantly 
updated.  Less risk of software piracy, more phone bills and network 
membership fees, of course. (Nevermind other risks added in this sort 
of system).  It seems like a kind of cable-tv-for-the-internet.  
People will join a service that provides an array of applications. 
Network membership fees and phonebills... or maybe they'll use cable 
modems and it will be included with the cable bill on their 
JavaVision (tm) boxes?

On the plud side, though: C never did standardize graphical 
interfaces.  Notice most of the demos in the JDK are graphical?

Rob.
