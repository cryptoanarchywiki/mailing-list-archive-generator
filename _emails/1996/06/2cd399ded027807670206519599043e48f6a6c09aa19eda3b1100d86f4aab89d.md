So we're going to argue about whether the word "cult" should apply
to CoS??  Okay, how about this: it's a _religion_ that uses
deception, mind control techniques, and criminal activities to
attempt to get as much possible money from as many marks^H^H^H^H^H
worshippers as possible, and goes to extreme lengths to silence
its critics.

Is that better?

Hubbard started CoS because he was getting too much heat over the
quackery and pseudoscience in "Dianetics."

I'm going to start a religion, too, called the Church of the Shell
Game.  Don't you call it a cult, or I'll be real mad!
