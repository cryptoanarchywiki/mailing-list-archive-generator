I didn't see this particular "Nightline," so I can't be certain this is the
same case I have been casually following for a couple of years. However, it
sounds like the case of the guy who spent a year at Intel, stole some
design tapes, went to work for AMD, offered them to AMD, had AMD refuse him
and report his offer to Intel (the chip companies are very cooperative in
these matters), and then proceeded on a bizarre course of offering the
tapes to various foreign nations.

A comedy of sorts, and his "damage" was essentially meaningless.

I don't recall _anything_ about him being planted by the FBI within Intel,
nor can I imagine any circumstances in which the FBI would try this. So
maybe I'm thinking of a different story.

Well, the "33 months" sounds like the story I remember. Bear in mind that
the tapes he took were essentially useless. A comedy, as I said.

(He was down in Brazil, living with his parents, sending out press releases
on how he had sold the tapes to Cuba and other such countries. He
voluntarily returned to the U.S. to face charges, so it sure looks like he
wanted to get caught....a psychological case more than a national security
case.)

Larry, you must not have been subscribed during the months when we debated
this issue many times. There have also been numerous mentions of this since
at least 1990, when I recall discussions of a change in mission for the
NSA.

In the case I described, involving Intel and Pentium plans and a recent
prison sentence, this was not the case. The FBI did not plant the thief.

I'm sure an Alta Vista search would turn up this story. I don't plan to do
it, though. I'm relatively certain the "Nightline" piece you cite is
related to the case I've described. Whether "Nightline" got its wires
crossed, or Larry did, is unknown to me.
