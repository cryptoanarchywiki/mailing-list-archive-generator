We have plenty of Java code that does crypto.  If anyone can think
of a suitable target (and perhaps a suitable prize for the winner),
we'll help knock up some code.  Click this if you're interested
http://systemics.com:79/  (alternatively finger @systemics.com)

The only targets I can think of are the Sun/Microsoft crypto API
keys (but I would guess that these keys are too large for an
attack to be feasible), and the unix password of David Sternlight
(which was posted to sci.crypt last summer).
