Actually, now that you mention it, mine is pegged.  I hadn't noticed,
because I was busy trying to recalibrate my bullshit detector which
was off the fucking dial.

LD's post is full of shit.

David Gerard, Jon Noring, and Ron Newman are not "flamers."  People
who have even lurked there for a short while should know this.  I've
seen Ron urge people towards compassionate behavior on a.r.s. more than
just about anyone on a.r.s.  It's a bit hard to be compassionate when
you're dealing with a group that uses every means at its disposal to
silence its critics.

I don't even think Nauta is on a.r.s., except for perhaps an occasional
crosspost or two.  Perhaps he lurks, but he doesn't post there to any
significant extent.

I don't know of any "Anti-Scientologists" who are forging cancels.  I
really doubt anyone would have checked with Dimitri first, though :)
JEM did issue a bunch of cancels, as have some of the ISPs whose
services have been abused.

We have been inundated with over 12,000 "vertical spam" posts since
May 19th, and it's still coming in.  Many of these posts are
repetitions of the same materials, and must be well over the BI by
now.

"Anti-Scientologists" have discussed various technological methods of
dealing with the spam (cross-posted to news.admin.net-abuse), but no
plan has been seized upon due to lack of consensus.

I've written an article in the latest issue of my zine about the spam,
if people would like more info.  URL in my sig.
