But the Apple II WAS a toy!  Non-detached keyboard, poor placement of reset 
key, upper-case only, 40-character wide display, odd microprocessor, VERY 
SMALL capacity floppies (which were very slow as well), as well as a hostile 
legal situation regarding the building of clones.  Hell, they even objected 
to other companies building boards which plugged into the bus!

Personally, I soured on the Apple II when I followed EDN magazine's attempt 
to build an engineering system with it, called "Project Indecomp."  They ran 
into a boneheaded design problem with the Apple, due to improper clock 
synchronization and bus timing.  They gave up the project, concluding that 
the Apple II was brain-dead.

BTW, Intel shares a substantial proportion of the blame for Apple's choice 
of the 6502.  The decision was made, I've heard, because Intel was still 
trying to get $200 for a slow 8080, while Western Design Center (?) wanted 
only about $20 for a 6502.

And by refusing to build Masatoshi (?) Shima's design for the Z-80, they 
totally lost the race for the 8-bit PC world.  The Z-80 turned into the 
highest-volume 8-bit microprocessor by far, leaving both the 8080 and the 
8085 in the dust, and even the 6502.

I have other, even harsher word for the design of the IBM PC.  Oh yes, the 
Mac sucks bigtime as well, although primarily for legal reasons.
