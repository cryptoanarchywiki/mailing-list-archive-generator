One of the oldest tricks for running a stock up (or down) is 
to put rumor teams on elevators in the financial district of
major cities.  All day long, they ride up and down elevators
having whispered, but not unintelligable, conversations about
the target company.  Of course, they "accidentally" drop what
sounds like important insider information.  Just think how
much more efficient the Net can be for such activities.
