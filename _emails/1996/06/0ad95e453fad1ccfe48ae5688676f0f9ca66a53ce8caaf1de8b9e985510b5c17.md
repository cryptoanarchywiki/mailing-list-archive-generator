For 99.99999% of the Internet "real DNS" is defined by the root server list
distributed with the most recent version of BIND.

Sorry, but this only gives you domain name resolution for the .nic TLD, not
the other new top-level domains they want to create or any domains that
alternic is proposing to provide service for.  To do that one needs to add an
appropriate line into the root.cache file (or whatever the root server list
is in your name server setup), at which point you are also trusting alternic
with pointing you properly to any domain they get queried on.

It is not just about habit, it is also about trust.  There are alternatives,
but they need to be thought-out much more than this alternic stuff...
