This is bullshit.  If anything, it's exactly the opposite:  It is the 
GOVERNMENTS and those who hold government jobs who are doing the 
"pressuring."    I haven't seen more than a trickle of desire for a 
"national position on cryptography."  What Internet-people want is the 
ELIMINATION of a "national position on cryptography," I think.

In other words, various Constitutions are getting in the way!  Tough!

In other words, the governments are feeling that the situation is getting 
out of their control!  Excellent, that's progress.

BULL!  The businesses are saying, "Don't restrict crypto."  The individuals 
are saying, "Don't restrict crypto!"  

So-called "law enforcement" agencies are saying, "We're losing control of 
the public!  Where's '1984' when we need it!"

I don't think so.

Gee, what about THE INDIVIDUALS?  You know, the ones you steal your tax 
money from?  That's right, the peons.

That's because the USG is the most unhappy, because its Constitution is 
making it very difficult to ban crypto.

 It was held immediately after a

It probably had a similar lack of participation by ordinary citizens and 
netizens.  Do I detect a pattern here?

Probably because they had gotten wind a few months before of a serious 
potential danger to the continued hegemony of governments over the people.

It's already too late!
