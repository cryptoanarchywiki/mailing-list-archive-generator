	How to save the whales is a logical outcome of Friedman's thesis that markets 
are everything. It is unfortunately very common for great men to get megalomania and 
believe they have the solution to the worlds problems in one theory.

	The flaw in Perry's "stakeholder" theory is the same one in many academic 
theories. It assumes that most people are smart enough to realise their true interests. 
It assumes that people take a longer term look than they do. 
................................................................................................


A point about the free market:

Those "great men" who advocate it realize that one theory may not solve the world's problems, that individuals themselves can come up with the answers to their own problems.

Instead of other people's theories and solutions being imposed upon them, individuals 
are seen as capable of interacting with each other and making decisions and trades in the market of choices made available through commercial enterprise, thus involving themselves in the discovery, pursuit, and satisfaction of their true interests.

It doesn't assume that because people's judgements can be flawed and that they can make mistakes, that therefore others (governments & other authoritative types) have the right to step in and determine for them how their dreams should be realized.
