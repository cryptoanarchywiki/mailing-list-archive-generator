Such a claim is bogus.  "existing law" already "applies" to new technology.  
It's just that this only means that cops think they have a right to wiretap. 
 It does not mean that they are able to usefully understand the meaning of 
what they hear.

Like a billion years too long, huh?

But is the average citizen substantially impacted by crimes that would be 
assisted by good encryption?  Probably not.

She forgot to mention REVOLUTION.

I see no need for a "balance."  I think that the advent of good encryption 
has the effect of increasing the security of individuals.

Maybe she should have said, "without toppling the government-employed 
parasites from their positions of power."

Another one of those organizations threatened by media-bypass.
