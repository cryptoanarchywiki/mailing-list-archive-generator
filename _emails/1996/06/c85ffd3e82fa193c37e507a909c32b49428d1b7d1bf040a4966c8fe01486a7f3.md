A week? No.

The second round of the cypherpunk's distributed key cracking (which 
bruted 40 bit RC4) completed  in 38 hours. That was a year ago.
With the growth in the number of interested people on the net, and the
upgrades in cpu power since then, I expect that a similarly motivated 
effort could burn the same number of cycles in well under 24 hours.
(The bottleneck a year ago was in coordination - not raw processing
power).

Prediction: By the millenium, we'll have made single DES look about as
silly as 40 bit RC4 is today.
