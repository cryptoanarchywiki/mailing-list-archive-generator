I confess to eventually yielding to temptation and answering the "survey"
questions (though I just made up some semi-random answers so as to get
Chapters 1-3, then 4-12, etc.).

It was truly bad stuff. Terribly written, confusing, no character
development except in a cartoonish way.

One correspondent chided me for saying that if the book was any good it
would have a real publisher, citing the opportunities for using the Web to
self-publish.

Well, the book is coming out in _printed_ form, for $20 or somesuch, from a
press I've never heard of.

If more than 500 copies are sold to actual paying, third-party customers,
I'll be surprised.
