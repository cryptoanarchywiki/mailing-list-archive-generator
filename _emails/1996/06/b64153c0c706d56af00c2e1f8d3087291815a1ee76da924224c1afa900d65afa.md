Just try doing some large graphical operations - especially 
raytracing/rendering type stuff, or heavy graphical analysis
of a set of image data.  Fractal drawing falls in this realm as well.
Then try doing some ASIC simulation, or finite element analysis.

In this group it also goes without saying that there are also things 
like factoring large numbers that a cycle market would be ideal for.
