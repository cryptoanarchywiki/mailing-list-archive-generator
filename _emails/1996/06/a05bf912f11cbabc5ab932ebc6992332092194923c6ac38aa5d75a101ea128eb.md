After hearing some of my friends and aquaintences rant about the little
metal strips in money and how it is a conspiracy to see how much cash you
have in your pockets from the orbital mind control satelites, I am just
waiting to see what they will say about e-cash.  Probibly something about
the hidden methods the government will force into the protocol to enable
them to track each and every transaction.  (Better not say that too loud
though, or they might get ideas...)

You will know that e-cash is here to stay when the conspiracy freaks latch
onto it as the next increment of the "Number of the Beast(tm)".

And you do not have to check in with the bank every time you spend it...
