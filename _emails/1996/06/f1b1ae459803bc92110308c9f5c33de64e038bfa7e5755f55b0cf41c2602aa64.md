I saw this, too.  The online AP report had the URL for the site at the
bottom (http://duke.usask.ca/~burgess/DPRK.html).  The site is no longer
there.

I suspect that a University president or provost or computer services 
manager had it removed.  I suspect that he or she is going to be VERY
embarassed real soon now.
