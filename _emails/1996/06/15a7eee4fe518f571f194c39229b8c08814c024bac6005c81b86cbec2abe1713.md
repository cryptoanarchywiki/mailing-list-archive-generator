I spoke with Rep. Lofgren for a while today while I was writing this
piece. I believe she's genuinely well-intentioned, but doesn't
understand the issues.

   The Hydra
   HotWired Special Report
   by Brock N. Meeks and Declan McCullagh
   Washington, DC, 11 June 
   
   A bill that would attempt to "fix" the potential harm of the
   Communications Decency Act was dropped into the legislative boneyard
   late yesterday by freshman Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-California).
   The bill, dubbed the "Internet Freedom and Child Protection Act,"
   provides neither.
   
   [...]

   Then there are her loopy additions. All Internet service providers,
   under government mandate, will become vendors of "blocking software"
   such as SurfWatch or Cyber Patrol. Lofgren's bill says that all new
   ISP customers must be provided, either free or at a fee, "screening
   software that is designed to permit the customer to limit access to
   material that is unsuitable for children." Of course, nowhere does she
   define what "unsuitable" means.

   However, such vagueness didn't stop Lofgren from proposing that the
   Federal Communications Commission move into the business of setting
   commercial software standards. Under this bill, the FCC is required to
   "prescribe minimum technical standards for screening software."

   [...]

   How does the FCC feel about a new proposed role as "software
   commissioner?" Frankly, they'd rather not be involved, according
   to Mark Corbitt, technology policy advisor to Chairman Reed Hundt.
