On today's Sally Jesse Raphel was Curtis Swiva?
founder of the Guardian Angels talking about his new record
of eating pickles.  He plans to break the record for eating 
22 hot dogs in 12 minutes.  The whole rest of the stage was
full of drag queens, and other rejects from the Jerry Springer
show.  Curtis must be really hard up to get his mug on TV!
