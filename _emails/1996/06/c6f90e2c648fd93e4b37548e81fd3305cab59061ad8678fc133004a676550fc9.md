But Tim, you know he is absolutely and literally correct!  It will, indeed, 
cause SERIOUS problems for those law-enforcement officials.  It'll put'em 
out of a job, at the very least.  Termination.  Possibly with extreme prejudice.

Seriously, however, for once I'd like to see some reporter pursue this kind 
of allegation with the person they're talking to.  He should ask, "what 
percentage of existing crime could be accomplished more effectively with 
good encryption that the cops can't break."  The truthful answer is, "not 
too damn much!"  

It seems to me that official-types must be thinking overtime about this kind 
of thing, because we're getting so much out of them along these lines.  
They're scared, for sure.
