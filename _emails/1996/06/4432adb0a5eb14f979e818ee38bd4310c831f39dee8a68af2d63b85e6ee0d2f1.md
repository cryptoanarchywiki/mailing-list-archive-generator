I am not convinced. For a mailing list it makes sense for all members 
to be aware of message integrity problems. Not all cypherpunks have 
your lisp package or Pronto Secure which make signature verification of 
the 10-20 pgp signed messages per day on the list a non trivial task.

I also like the idea that cpunks provides as a byproduct a platform for 
developers to test and debug their security products. We really should 
be getting the bugs out of plain text signatures. You cannot expect Joe 
User to differentiate between an intruder and a gateway massaging the
message.
