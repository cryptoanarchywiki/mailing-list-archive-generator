	Uh....  Wait a minute.  I don't normally pick on spelling and
grammar errors (heaven knows - I make enough myself) but this discussion,
over patents and laws, seems to be involving someone bent on setting a
record for ridiculous errors.  Is "Intense" a child?  (Actually my children,
all three of them, would not make these mistakes!)  We see here a discussion
over points of patent law and government policy, and Jim seems to be having
a battle of wits with a half-armed opponent.
