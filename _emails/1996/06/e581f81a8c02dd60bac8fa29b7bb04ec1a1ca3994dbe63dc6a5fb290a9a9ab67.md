Rumour has it that it is done like this:

"To read a protected 16C84 make sure your VPP is 13.5 volts, then VCC should  
be about .5 volt less, I dont know about the accuracy of this one person  
told me he used a diode thet is .6 volts. now write the value 0x001f to the  
fuse 0x2007 about 3-10 times switch back to standard and read the chip. " 

It may or may not work - I would be interested if anyone can confirm it.
