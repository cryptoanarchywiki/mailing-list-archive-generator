There was a story on CNN about how anonymous people on IRC (and other 
commercial online chats) giving stock tips is a Bad Thing (tm).  
Actually had some guy saying that a law should ban anonymous 
discussions of stocks online.

Yeesh. What ever happened to caveat emptor?  (Like a recommendation 
on IRC is automatically more trustworthy than overhearing a 
conversation in a public bathroom?)
