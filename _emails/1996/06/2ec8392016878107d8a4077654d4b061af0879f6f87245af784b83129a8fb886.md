  I agree with you, Tonie, as usual.
   I struggled with this, for years, until I had a dream.  I was on a 
battlefield, pinned down by enemy fire, and I was out of ammunition.  
There was plenty of slave labor stuff around, on the corpses of enemy 
soldiers, but of course, I couldn't use that, morally,  because it was 
made available by force.
  So I made a decision, and I didn't die in my sleep.

  If libertarians deprive themselves of what is legal, they impoverish 
themselves, relative to the more socialistic others, and the the cancer 
continues to gather strength by taking ours for themselves.
  But that is no reason to continue it in law, when we have the power to 
reverse or negate the law itself, that legalizes theft.
  In a future dream, I will free the slaves with the fruits of their 
forced labor, so they will be forced no more.  I think all libertarians 
fundamentally want to do this.
  So...We need to trust elected libertarians, not to be seduced by 
existing collectivist power, to use it at any and every opportunity, to  
return all power to the individual.   Otherwise, what is the point?
  P.S.  I am unable to afford to go the the National Convention.  Sorry 
to miss seeing all of you who are going.

Roger
