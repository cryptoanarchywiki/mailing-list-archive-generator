Well, why. If I were a corrupt politician, I'd start with exterminating
all posters to Cypherpunks, starting with you (with exception of a
couple of people). 

As a Russian, I can see that you lack the feeling of proper scale when
you think about exterminations. This is forgivable since you have never
seen them. There is no need to exercise any discretion or even fairness
if you have enough cash and a good assassination clearinghouse.

I'd also set up a number of fake clearinghouses and assassinate those
who provide *your* clearinghouse with anonymous services (if your 
clearinghouse is run anonymously).

I think that it is a fine idea and a neat experiment (Russians love
such experiments, you know), but it will go way farther than you think.

Again, many governments would appreciate the nice opportunity to reach 
their political goals by assassination means.

There are some interesting people who do not like spending hard earned
$$ on clothes, heated water pools, and Bentleys. They'd rather prefer
the fun of seeing their neighbors disappear and their families terrified.

Number of such people won't really decline over time.
