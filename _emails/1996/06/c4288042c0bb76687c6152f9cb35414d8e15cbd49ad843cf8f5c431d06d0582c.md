The term is used commonly in the Linux community due to the
vger.rutgers.edu bottleneck most of the development mailing lists go
through.  There's too much volume for one machine to handle, so
exploders are used to relay outgoing email by domain name.  This has
to mean that the subscriber list is distributed via the exploders,
though I'm not familiar with exactly how they're doing it.

At any rate, the way they are used put it in direct contradiction to
Declan's quote above, since they are *only* used as a broadcast
mechanism.
