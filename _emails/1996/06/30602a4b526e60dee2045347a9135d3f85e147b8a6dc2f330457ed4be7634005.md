There's a bunch of labels and printings inside
the board, the pc board says ELE 2001;
the chip says NCR '82 and 31960;
and a couple labels on the inside of
the case that don't make any sense.

Do I have any chance of getting term
support for this, or getting a new
keyboard like this?  It seems ideal.

The connector and cable is standard XT-like.
