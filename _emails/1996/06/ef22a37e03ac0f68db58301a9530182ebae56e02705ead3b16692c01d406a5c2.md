	I'm not sure that, even in theory spreading your key over
multiple machines isa good idea.  The issue to me is reliability.  If
you (the remailer op) have a single machine thats well secured, you
can get a decent idea of its state at a given time.  It is dependant
on those things that the net depends on, DNS and IP being close to
working.  If the remailer is distributed, you've raised the work to
maintain by a factor of N, and increased the probability of the
machine being insecure by the same amount.  You've also reduced
reliability to that of the least reliable machine.

	The better model (imho) is to have 'co-processing' strong
remailers in safe places.  (I think Alex described these here a few
months back; you have a firewall host that talks to the net, and a
second machine attached to it which does the mixing, and passes
messages back to the firewall for distribution.

| but 8-10 ticks/second); as compensation you get a word-size that if

| for a secure digital poker/card-playing system over the next couple of months
| and if I have some spare time I might see just how difficult creating a

| OTOH, a secure PCMCIA or smart-card will probably end up being a better

Yeah.
