[short-attention-span summary:  someone's using Netscape
cookies as a way to target-market browser users.  Since I
hate being targeted, I came up with a hack "fix" to prevent
it, see below]

My own experiments shows that simply removing the cookie file
(~/.netscape/cookies) works to "fix" this, as long as you don't
have old netscape config files lying about (then it pops a dialog
asking if you want to nuke the old config, and uses the old
cookies file).  Netscape (version 3.0b for Linux) doesn't
recreate the cookies file.  Of course this "fix" means
that I'm not able to take advantage of whatever cookies might
offer me, but since I can't control them and never see them
there's probably not a lot that they do that I'll miss.


I think that Netscape should add a configuration to the browser
so that paranoid privacy fanatics like me can disable cookies
or better yet control which ones that we'll accept.
