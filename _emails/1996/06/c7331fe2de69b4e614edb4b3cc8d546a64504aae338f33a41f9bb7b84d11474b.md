They played it again, so I got it on video tape.  They
were talking about the encryption export issue and then 
showed my page and said:

The arms trafficker page was shown on CNN computer connection  
about 3:05 pm Saturday June 1, 1996, and again at 4:05 am June 2.
 
At some point a full transcript of the show should be on:
