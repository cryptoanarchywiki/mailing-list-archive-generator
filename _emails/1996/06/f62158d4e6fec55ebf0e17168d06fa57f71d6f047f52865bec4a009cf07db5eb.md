IANAL, but I think you must be wrong about this, Perry.  If this were
the case then, as an employee of company XYZ, I would never be permitted
to buy XYZ stock (which is clearly not the case) since I *always* have
information that others outside the company do not (about staff changes,
product plans and such).  I suspect the deciding factor must have to do
with the ability to execute actions which have substantial direct effects
on the stock price (i.e. buying a company, declaring dividends, having a
massive downsizing, etc.).
