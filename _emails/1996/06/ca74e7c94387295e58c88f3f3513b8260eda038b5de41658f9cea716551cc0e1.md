Of course, trade secret status could also be destroyed by posting something
straight without anonymity.  And were one judgment proof one's exposure as
the poster would be meaningless.  Even a completely non-anonymous account
may be hard to trace if you have a common name and the account is based
somewhere far from home.  If you open an account on a Dutch system using
your (common) name, you might be hard to find.

It's the ease of publication not the anonymity that makes the Net dangerous
for trade secrets.
