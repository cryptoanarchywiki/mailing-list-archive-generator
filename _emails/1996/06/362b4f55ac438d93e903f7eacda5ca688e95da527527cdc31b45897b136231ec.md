If someone else has your secret key, it's safe to assume you're toast. ;)
Better a new key and revocation certificate before the forgeries start
(or before someone ELSE does before you ... <shudder>).

More specifically, if you've failed to assign a passphrase to your
secret key, you ARE toast, because anyone can just pick it up and use
it.

If you did use a passphrase, it becomes a question of breaking either
the passphrase, or the IDEA algorithm used to encrypt your secret key.
It's usually a lot easier to break the passphrase than it is to brute
force IDEA.

See the PGP Passphrase FAQ
(http://www.stack.urc.tue.nl/~galactus/remailers/passphrase-faq.html)
and Arnold Reinhold's page (http://world.std.com/~reinhold/papers.html)
for more details.
