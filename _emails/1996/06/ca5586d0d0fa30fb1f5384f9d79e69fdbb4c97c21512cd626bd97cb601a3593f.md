If people want to believe in a religion which combines the best features 
of anthropomorphic sky-God worship with a UFO contactee cult, that is their
Constitutional right, giggling from the audience notwithstanding. 

I believe it was Thomas Jefferson who said that the voluminous amount of
theological writings by Christian scholars existed only because "nonsense
can never be explained."  I tend to concur.

Most religious doctrine is just a lot of energized enthusiasm.
