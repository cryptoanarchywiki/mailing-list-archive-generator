Not really too off topic at all, considering the surveillance state 
and GAK relate very much to what we're doing here.

An aside: at the University I used to attend, there were field trips 
to this small museum on the campus by elementary school children, who 
apparently regarded the motion detectors for the automatic doors as 
being cameras which they'd happily wave hello to.  Images of Huxley's 
Brave New World intermingled with Warhol's 15-minutes-of-fame stewed 
up with Orwell here....

Since when are we now to carry ID everywhere. And of course the local 
police will (as usual) be selective about who they stop to ask about 
directions.

Also note that a reasonable exception will be for kids to go to work 
or school-related activities (institutional), but nothing 
non-institutional such as a party at a friend's house (drugs or no 
drugs), band practice, etc. etc.

Some communities here in Long Island have them. Others have fought 
them, and I think a couple of attempts were struck down by courts. 
Also a blurb in the local papers about police not wanting the curfew 
here, believing it to be a waste of their time or unnecessary... 
(I'll have to dig the article up; I only rememebr it wasn't 
reassuring.)

A problem indeed. Children grow up used to the surveillance society 
and don't mind it when they become adults.  Imagine a whole 
generation coming of age being told they are "criminals".  Things 
will be very "interesting" (in the Chinese fortune cookie sense) 
during the next 10-20 years...

...or they'll stay at home and net surf.  Beware the Four (or six?) 
Horsemen...
