What if in the future a country banned the internet and all things that had
to deal with it (ie-  telnet, irc). It would be  the "underground" thing.
Just a thought, it would really suck! As I think about it it is impossible
or is it???? Hell the usa cant even ban porn let alone the whole thing. They
could ban it like they did fizzies. Hey there making a comeback did you here
now they have nutrasweet in them. If you know what fizzies are than your
pretty kewl. I'm only 13 and love then they are the drink of the future!!!!
