I agree with Hal's points, but I suspect that these technicalities will be
ignored when the first _complaint_ reaches the DeathStar's administrators.

"Your account has been cancelled."

I suspect other major ISPs will adopt similar language, absent a vocal
lobbying group for anonymous messaging capabilities.

On the other hand, what happens to the AT&T customers who are using
anonymous message services for the "politically correct" uses? Namely, to
post messages to rape support groups, child-abuse groups (so-called
"survivors," in modern PC parlance), and homosexuality groups? Will AT&T
cancel their accounts for hiding under a veil of pseudoanonymity?

(Or just require that their identity be "escrowed"?)
