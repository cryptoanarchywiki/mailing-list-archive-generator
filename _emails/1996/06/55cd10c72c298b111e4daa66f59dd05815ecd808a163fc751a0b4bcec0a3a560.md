Not every member of this list rejects his views.  I for one do not
reject them outright, but will not defend his views publically for
fear of embarassing the corporation that I work for. I do not
reject Jim Bell's violent views for the simple reason that violence
is often required to fight violence.  In other words, the best you
can hope for is "... but his violent views were rejected by some
members of the group."

He *is* a member. And why shouldn't he be?  Are you suggesting that
this group become moderated? (hiss).  The whole AP concept is very
relevent to the Cypherpunks, whether the majority like it or not.

No platform for lunatics???  If there is one thing that a Cypherpunk
should have learned during his time in the group, is that the answer
to hate speech (or violent speech, or whatever you wish to call it)
is more speech.

If your fear is that reporters will get hold of the wrong end of the
stick, then perhaps you are correct, but the real problem is the
*reporters*, not the attitude of the Cypherpunks.  blame them.
propose a solution. (how about abolition of all libel laws?)

I disagree with the phrase "evil enthusiasms."  Bell is not an
evil man.  A little crazy perhaps, but not evil.  If you bothered
to listen to him, you would find that his aim is to create a
"better" world, where people (especially politicians) are very
much more responsible for their own actions.  He suggests that
the number of deaths due to AP will be less that the number of
deaths due to the current corrupt system.

think about it.  how many on this group would have another man
killed for his views?  For his noisy stereo?  For a competive
advantage in business?  I am confident the answer will be zero.

On the other hand, I would gladly throw in a few dollars to have
certain politicians killed.  gladly.  and I will be able to sleep
at night.  I will sleep better knowing that, although I was
partly responsible for a mans death, I will have saved countless
others (a bit like dropping an a-bomb on Japan).


Question for Jim - would you resort to AP to have Bryce popped off?
