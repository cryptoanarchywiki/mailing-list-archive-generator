The attached summary is substantially incorrect. I know some of the
"flamers" you mentioned, and their intentions are *not* to stop the
Scientologists from discussing their religion.

On the contrary, the Scientologists are trying to make it very difficult
for anyone to *criticize* the Church of Scientology or reveal some of
its more wacky teachings.

Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 8-Jun-96 RFD: Time to kick some
anti.. by Dr.Dimitri V. KOTM@bwalk 
> 1. There's a gang of flamers (David Gerard, Jon Noring, Ron Newman, Rob J.
> Nauta, and the like) who try to stop $cientologists from discussing their
> religion on the Usenet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology. Most of them are
> disgruntled former cult members and/or members of other similar cults.
>  
> 2. The anti-scientologists have caused many cypherpunks anonymous remailers
> to shut down via their egotistical misuse of them, viz. criminally posting
> copyrighted Co$ writings to Usenet. They did it knowing that the Co$ is
> likely to harrass the remailer operators, causing them to shut down and
> depriving everyone of their services.
>  
> 3. These harrassers are Usenet Cabal supporters, and they are sometimes
> joined by initerant cabal enforcers such as Peter Vorobieff, who visit a.r.s
> to lend a helping hand and to flame Co$.
>  
> 4. Recently the anti-scientologists have asked me for a copy of my cancelbot,
> and have been using it to forge cancels for scientologist posts on a.r.s.
