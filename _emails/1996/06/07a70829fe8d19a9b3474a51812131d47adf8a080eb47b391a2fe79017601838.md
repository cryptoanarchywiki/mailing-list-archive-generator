Apologies, but rich has deleted me from
his mailboxes, and for a few days now,
somebody has placed a global cancel bot on
me.  I'm gonna have plenty of fun figuring
this out.  Kwow any good sniffers?

I agree the list should be public usenet:
A mail gate-way to a usenet group that
ALSO permits unmoderated posts.  This
would be a nice way to combine a strict
moderated mail-list, with a standard 
netnews group.
