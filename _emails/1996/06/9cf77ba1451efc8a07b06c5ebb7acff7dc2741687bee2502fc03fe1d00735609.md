Look, "we" are very pleased at your interest in the list.  "We" are happy
to accept all manner and age of persons be they 13, 31, 113 or 131.  "We"
do not filter messages on a list wide basis (though individuals may).  In
return we ask only that you post things related to crypto and crypto
anarchy.  This may or may not include the law/political/libertarian rants
I post, but it certainly does not include plugs for graphic software
conferences in Kentucky.

This is not a direct mailing list.  It is not a general announcement list.
Mr. Metzger is quite right when he points out that cypherpunks has become
a sewer.  Signal to noise ratio has become so silly as to even begin to
offend >me<.  I appreciate that you have found a new group of interesting
people, ideas and intellects.  Please try to restrain your enthusiasm to
below the point where it causes you to post every single thing that comes
to your mind.

Lets all take pains to counter the birth-growth-broadening-death cycle
that plagues most mailing lists, yes?
