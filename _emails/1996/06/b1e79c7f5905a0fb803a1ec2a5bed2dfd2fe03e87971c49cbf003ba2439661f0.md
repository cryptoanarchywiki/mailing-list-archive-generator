I only watched a few minutes of the show.  Did they mention that Microsoft 
actually bought the MSDOS operating system from Seattle Computer products?

Also, in about January of 1976, I attended a meeting at a hotel near Kansas 
City International airport, run by MITS (makers of Altair) showing off their 
computer.  (They drove a van around the country and demo'd the computer to 
throngs of...oh...hundreds of people.  

At the time, I had followed the budding microcomputer hobby only a little.  
I specifically recall being told at the show 
of complaints by a company called "Microsoft" that its "4K Basic" was being 
bootlegged.  (Note to the newbies:  The term "4K Basic" meant a Basic 
interpreter that fit in a main memory space of 0.004 megabytes.)   I soon 
learned that they were selling it for about $500, or about 12 cents per 
executable byte.

Literally!
