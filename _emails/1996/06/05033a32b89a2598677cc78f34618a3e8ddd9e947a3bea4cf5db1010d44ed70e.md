Why, thank you very much for the kewl compliment. 
 
 
May I correct your correction of the URL for addres.txt: it should be "jya"
not "jwa," to read: 
 
 
    http://pwp.usa.pipeline.com/~jya/addres.txt 
 
 
Several c'punks have kindly noted my clumsy typing thumbs by breaking them.

 
 
Regards, 
 
 
Kohn
