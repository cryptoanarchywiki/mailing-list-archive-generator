NEWS

WE WIN!

After 18 months of work, netizens finally got the justice they so
richly deserve.  The three-judge panel in Philadelphia issued a ruling
today saying that they had examined the Communications Decency Act,
learned about the Internet as a medium, and concluded that the law is
an inappropriate method of regulating cyberspace.  This decision
establishes an overwhelmingly positive precedent for the final decision
by the Supreme Court, expected early next year.

The famed "Question Mark" icon that had started popping up all over the
WWW changed simultaneously at 9:09am from a question mark to fireworks,
as thousands of Netizens began the mad rush to obtain a copy of the
court decision celebrating their victory.  You can read a copy of the
decision or obtain a copy of the icon yourself at
http://www.vtw.org/speech/

Senator Feingold (D-WI) said today, "This is welcome news for all of us
who not only support free speech, but who also want to see this new
dynamic communications technology develop safe from the threat of
censorship."

Feingold continued, "This issue is larger than so-called 'adult'
expression or communications.  It is about whether the government will
decide what we see, hear, and write."

Join millions of other netizens as they read the decision, rally, celebrate,
and thank the court for taking the time to do what some members in Congress
and the President would not do: apply the First Amendment.
