No, Tim, I got your point. What I object to is the use of the list to 
express yet another tangental non-topical thread when we already have the 
"hallowed" Dr. Hallam-Baker pontificating on the virtues and 
existentialism of the marketplace at what I suppose he presumes is at the 
expense of Perry Metzger, the assasination politics bullshit, and various 
other noise producing posts.

What you may not realize is, while the CoS may be interested in 
protecting their reputation, I have not seen spam in this list as the 
result of any critism; however, anti-mormonism runs long and deep, and 
there will be a deluge of postings here should some entrprising 
individual take it upon himself to post the topic elsewhere (which I have 
seen samples of post from this list appear in other usenet groups.)

What I don't want to see is this list get any muddier. 4 Days out of 
pocket and I have 345 messages, most of which gets round filed.

I don't comment on the Catholics as I don't know enough about them to 
render an informed opinion.

As to the free speech and exercising of religion issues, I find that more 
relavent and worthy of the writings that hallmark your thoughtfulness on 
any topic.
