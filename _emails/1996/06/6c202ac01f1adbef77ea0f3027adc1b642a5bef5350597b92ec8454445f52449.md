|Unfortunately, the feedback address that Sun provides in the slides is
|unknow to their mailserver (at least it was last week) and no further
|information seem to be avaiable about their "public and open" policy.

In the actual talk, I said "will be public and open", that is when we
actually announce the policy it will be public and open. The things
that are certain about it is that it will be constrained only by export
considerations, and that we'll sign competitors' packages.

I am hoping that I can get a spec document for the API ready by the end
of the month. By then we will have more details regarding the export
stuff. In the meantime, I'll see if we can get an interim FAQ
together.

The security-api@java.sun.com address should be working now.
