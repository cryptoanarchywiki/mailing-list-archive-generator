: This is a fucking big story.
: Allowing the CIA and NSA to snoop domestically, and using only a handful of
: suspicions and anecdotes about cybernastiness and evil cryptohackers to
: justify this major policy shift -- well, it's fucking amazing.
: Nunn's proposal, unfortunately, was more than a "suggestion."

This is very serious. Why has there not been more discussion about 
this on the list?

How close/far is this from becoming law?

If they are now trying to make it legal for the CIA and NSA to snoop 
inside the US  I would guess that it's happening already. Remember
wiretaps? Do it now and they will make it legal later.
