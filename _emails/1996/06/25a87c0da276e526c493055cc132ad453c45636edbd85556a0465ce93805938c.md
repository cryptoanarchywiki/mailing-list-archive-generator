I suspect (but don't have any direct knowledge) that strong crypto
classes are distributed after encryption by Sun's private key. The
corresponding public key is enbedded in the Java Class Loader and/or
virtual machine (or the security framework class -- I'm only speculating
here).

This means that "rogue" encryptors can't work under Sun's security
manager as they will be rejected as "unloadable"
