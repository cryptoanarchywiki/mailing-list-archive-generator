I've got one - though I haven't had much of a chance to play with it so 
far (Be is in the same building as EIT, and I kept running into jlg in 
the lift :-)

They are pretty cool machines - the back panel is the ultimate in geek 
cool (there about as many ports and sockets as a sparc center 1000). The 
software is pretty alpha (they make no bones about that), and I have some 
reservations about their decision to use C++ as the API to just about all 
of the OS (things get pretty fragile when upgrading), but it's still a 
really cool box, and even if BeOS never pans out completely, you can 
still run Linux on it.

If you're in Menlo Park, definitely get a DEMO, it's the coolest new 
machine on the block.

p.s
  does anywhere sell reasonably priced replicas of classic crypto 
hardware?
