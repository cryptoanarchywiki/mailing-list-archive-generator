Interesting that the day after you posted this the front-page of the UK's
major newspapers carried a story about the Labour party proposing
precisely the same thing in the UK. Of course the cops already have
surveillance cameras all over the place.

I tried it a few weeks ago when they stopped me for a random breath test
(illegal as far as I know) after following me for three miles while I
scrupulously obeyed the law. They originally claimed that they had stopped
me randomly, because "that's what I pay them for", but when I questioned
the legality they decided that I'd crossed the centerline while passing a
parked car and therefore must be drunk (even though my car was too wide to
not cross the line). In other words, I don't think they care about the
legal issues. Still, I suppose it's better than being stopped for "driving
at 2:30 in the morning" again. Hmm, who said the UK didn't have a curfew
already?

Gun-thieves will love that one. Why steal them one at a time when you can 
steal twenty or thirty in one go?
