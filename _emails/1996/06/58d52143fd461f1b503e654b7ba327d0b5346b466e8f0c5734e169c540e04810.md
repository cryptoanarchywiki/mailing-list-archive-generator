V-One Corp. said it will be supplying a key security component to the 
smart card identification and transaction system that Florida State 
University is developing.

When the system, SmartWorld, is deployed later this year, students will 
gain access through the Internet to a host of applications touching on 
many aspects of campus life. Electronic financial transactions over the 
network will be secured through mutial authentication and encryption 
aided by the smart card.

V-One said it will provide its SmartGate "middleware," which allows 
virtually any application to run securely on public networks like the 
Internet. The agreement also provides for cross-training between V-One 
and Florida State personnel, and V-One technology will be incorporated in 
demonstrations that Florida State's Card Application Technology Center 
makes in marketing its system to other universities and colleges, 
government agencies, and other organizations.
