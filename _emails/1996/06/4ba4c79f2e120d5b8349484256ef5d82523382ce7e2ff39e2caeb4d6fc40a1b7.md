Okay, I was not trying to suggest that any particular source is followed.  
What I'm noticing is the almost uniformly "pessimistic" (as to the fate of 
the government) views I've read on the various computer networks, and the 
uniformly hostile reactions to government proposals.  This can't be 
reassuring to the people in power today.

Don't be so sure.  Legislators, alone, don't have the smarts to figure out 
why they "needed" a Clipper-chip proposal, or the capacity to tap 1% of the 
phone calls, or other recent government proposals.  Government is usually 
very good at ignoring problems long after they become problems.  The fact 
that they're so hot to control the Internet suggests to me that somebody has 
been talking to them about what is going to happen.
