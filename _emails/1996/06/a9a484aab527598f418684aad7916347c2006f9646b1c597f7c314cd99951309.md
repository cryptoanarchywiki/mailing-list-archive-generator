: the primary and secondary name servers working just fine.

The org. folks ARE the InterNIC.  The machines on ROOT-SERVERS.NET are all
fed by the NIC.  My problem with the original statement was the implication
that using your own nameserver as having zone authority was a bad idea.
Not only is it a good idea, it is standard operating procedure.  You're 
absolutely right about being "hard to reach" (a bit understated) if the
NIC drops your record.  Any recursive lookups will fail.


: Now, you can improve your odds a bit by getting popular systems, such as
: aol.com and compuserve.com to act as secondary nameservers for you -
: you may lose connectivity to Europe, but you're in the cache for half
: the Net that way...

Well, if you decide to use AOL as your secondary, you will only be accessible
(by name) outside of aol.com for about 48 hours after the NIC drops your 
records.  After that, only users who use one of aol.com's name servers
will be able to access your domain.  Then, when someone else registers your
domain, AOL will probably drop you like a bad habit (if they don't when the NIC
drops you).  I'm sure that AOL (or Compuserve, etc.) are not too keen on being
the odd man out when the NIC and the rest of the world say XYZ.COM is owned
by your competitor and AOL says it is owned by you.
