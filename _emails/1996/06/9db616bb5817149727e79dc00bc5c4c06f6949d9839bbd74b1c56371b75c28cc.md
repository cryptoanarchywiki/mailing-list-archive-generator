Actually, he's probably right. If all the cypherpunks, say, turned "bad,"
there'd be no government and no economy, because so many big systems are so
insecure.

Pooh-poohing the potential risk is not a winning proposition. Pointing out
that the government's policies against properly secure systems have created
this house of cards in which we live is. The NRC crypto report helps
legitimize this spin.
