I vaguely remember hearing that a nuclear device exploded high over the
midwest would have significant EMP effects over half the continental USA.

When a USSR pilot flew a "state of the art" fighter out and US intelligence
got their hands on it we were surprised that all the electronics were
vacuum tubes.  However, vacuum tubes are highly resistant to EMP.  (They
arc between elements, rather than fry like ICs.)

Makes you want fiber optic comm cable.  Protection inside the cage probably
depends on how powerful the EMP is.  However, the need for some degree of
stealth in Class III InfoWar will limit the strength of the EMP.
