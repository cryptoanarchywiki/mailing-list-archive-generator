This, by the way, is the main thing that concerns certain civil rights
groups (including the Santa Cruz chapter of the ACLU). They say they'll be
monitoring enforcement patterns to see if more "children of color" are
picked up than their percentage in the population represents.

Personally, I liked my "religious exemption" example. The Baal worshippers
can claim that they are engaging in their religion by grokking the
darkness. If picked up and held, they can claim they are "being held
without Baal."

Most of the ordinances, including the one here, specifically state that
"blanket permission" by parents is not acceptable. They want _specific_
reasons for being out after curfew.

(It's this taking control from both the kids and their parents and putting
it in the hands of cops that really bugs me.)

By the way, if being out after curfew is breaking the law, can I make a
"citizen's arrest" of some of those nice young chicas in Watsonville?
