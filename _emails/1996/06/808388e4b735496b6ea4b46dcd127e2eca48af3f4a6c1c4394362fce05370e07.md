The TA isn't just looking at your messages.  All traffic through the
remailer represents data.  The S/N ratio is constant whether the
machine has a single remailer or a dozen.  The total traffic through a
machine with a dozen remailers is likely to be higher, since the total
number of remailers world-wide is so small, and users are looking for
fairly random and fairly long chains.  This means that the TA's
statistical sample is a larger fraction of the population (of total
remailer traffic), so correlations identified are stronger.

I agree totally.  The whole point is that multiple remailers on one
machine are a bad thing.  If it weren't for traffic analysis, we would
be happy even if there were only one remailer world-wide that we felt
was safe from subversion.  Adding more remailers to the same machine
doesn't improve protection from traffic analysis, and may slightly
weaken it (by attracting more traffic).

Therefore, multiple remailers on a single machine are a bad thing.
