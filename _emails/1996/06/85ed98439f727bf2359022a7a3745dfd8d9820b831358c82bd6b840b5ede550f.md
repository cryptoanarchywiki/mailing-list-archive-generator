FBI InfoSec Guru Randy Perlman (Prilamen? Filament?) was interviewed on
CNN BizNews this morning by Deborah Marchini:  "Hackers" are menacing the 
net and society.  

Marchini prompted him but he concurred:  Hackers are a *THREAT TO 
NATIONAL SECURITY*.  There you have it, the root password to the 
Constitution.  Illegal wiretapping, assassination, anything is now justified
in the defense of our NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE.
