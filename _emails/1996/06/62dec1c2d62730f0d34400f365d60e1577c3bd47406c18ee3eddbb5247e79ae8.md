Attorney Lance Rose, originally scheduled for the HotWired Electronic
Frontiers Forum this Thursday night, June 27 (probably TODAY as you read
this...), could not make it, however in his place we've extended an
11th-hour invitation to Bruce Taylor of the National Law Center for Children
and Families, and he's accepted.  Please join us!
