It's been said before, but I'll say it again.
I have no objection with this.

If people wish to safeguard their encryption/signature keys by leaving them with a "trusted third party", then they should be able to do so.

If this is a requirement, then it's hardly a service for which there is a "commercial demand".

I assume that followup news releases (or the aforementioned workshop) will clarify the situation.
