Compared to my SOL, the Apple II would've been more useful, in retrospect.
As to the 40-character display, that was the norm in those days. (My SOL,
and certainly the other machines available to home users at that time, had
only a 40-character-wide display...when in worked.)

The comments about the floppies (" VERY SMALL capacity floppies (which were
very slow as well") is even more off-base. In fact, it was probably Apple's
ability to put _any_ kind of floppies on the Apple II, for a reasonable
price, that ensured its success. Processor Technology was effectively sunk
by delays in getting its "Helios" 8-inch floppy drive working. The bigger
and faster 8-inchers may have been technically superior to Apple's
"Integrated Woz Machine" drivers and 5-inch floppies, but Apple was
shipping. That counts for a _lot_.

You need to check your claims more carefully. There are always many reasons
a chip is selected for a design.

Again, your understanding of the history of Intel, Zilog, and the industry
in general is lacking.

The design and process technology resources were instead committed to the
8086, and history is rather clear about the wisdom of doing that. Intel is
now capitalized at something like $50-70 billion, and Zilog is no longer on
the radar screen.
