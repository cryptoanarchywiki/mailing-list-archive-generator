! I'm guessing that "D0Dz" is a variant on "dudes";
! is "31173" supposed to be an upside-down "ElliE"?
! Having worked at NCR, I like their cash-machines and cash-registers,
! dislike the Microchannels in some of their PCs, 
! dislike the terminals they used to make (I think SunRiver
! is the current manufacturer for that product line)
! and like their Teradata descendants.

Oops.  I wrote that just looking at the keyboard.
Picked it up at Seattle's Ex-Pc for $3.
It's so old, I think it requires a non-PC BIOS.
No manual, labels etc.

Anyone have a clue as to what this is:

NCR

F1 F2          [...]               F18 F19 F20/RESET|
ESC            [...]     TAB             |[five direction keys]
CONTROL Q      [...]     }/] CONTROL     |CLR 7 8 9 /
CAPS_LOCK A    [...]      ~/` |NEW       |  - 4 5 6 *
[up] |/\ Z     [...]   [upup] |LINE      |  + 1 2 3 |NEW
               [space]                   |  0_ 00 . |LINE

It was designed for easily customizing your keytable,
being an actual flat terminal with square keys easily
pulled out and interchanged.

The back of the keyboard has three switches for
the boolean selection of languages: US English,
UK/Int. English, French, German, Swedish/Finnish,
Danish/Norwegian, Spanish, Italian.

So, where to get a NEW keyboard like this:

FLAT, with a full set of SQUARE, EASILY pulled out keys.
