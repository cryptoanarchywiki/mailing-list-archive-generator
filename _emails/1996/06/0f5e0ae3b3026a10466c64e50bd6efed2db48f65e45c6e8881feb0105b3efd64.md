Wrong.  The _original_ apple 2 floppy held about 130K -- competitive with 
other single-density single-sided floppies of the day... 1 1/2 years later, 
they fit 160K on a single-sided single-density floppy, almost as much as 
an IBM double-density single-sided floppy (180K)  (This is related to the 
fact that the apple used 5+3 encoding, while IBM still uses the 
more-obvious but less-efficient 4+4 -- read _Beneath_Apple_DOS_ for more 
details)
