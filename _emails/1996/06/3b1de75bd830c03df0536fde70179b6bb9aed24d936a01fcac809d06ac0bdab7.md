political figures..yep....out.
the most recent Oj or whoever joke...out
ANY ethnic joke...out. IE yo mam's so black she went to nightschool and they

This cr*p is so unlimited as to what rights of ours it overruns on.
Imagine this: a message posted appeals to 34,000 people that read it.
1 person is offended..complains..
Same thing happens again. The person's user access is cancelled.
BS? You decide. My opinion is evident =-}
