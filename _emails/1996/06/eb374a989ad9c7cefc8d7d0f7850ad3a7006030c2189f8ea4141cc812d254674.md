A better way is to add the nameserver data file distributed by alternic and
adding it to primary nameserver data.  The file that the alternic distributes
does not have any root level servers defined (except the ones distributed by
the Internic) so there isn't much trust involved.

I don't see trust as being much of a factor on the user-end.  The only people
that really need to trust alternic are the people who have domain names
registered with them.  If the alternic starts screwing with its nameserver
data, this will just cause them a severe loss of reputation without any gain.
