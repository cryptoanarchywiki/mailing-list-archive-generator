 "computer illiterate" thanks real big confidence booster. I love my pc & my
 mac, I also love my Apple II it showed me the way of programming (first with
 basic), now I program in C and C++. Oh yea I guess I'm still computer
 illiterate.  >>
Id hate to say it.... But i KNOWW you read the part in my letter about it
being a GENERAL statement.. i seem to recall I put general in all caps too.
Or do those apple 2's only work in all caps... Didnt use those. I used my old
atari 800xl to learn basic back in OOooooo 3rd grade. Damn.. Long time
ago..........
Back to some encryption things.............I have something I need to look up
a little. more..... but Im interested on starting a decryption of a string.
It was encrypted using a password, and a randomly seeded number thats
reseeded for every character in the string i beliveve... let me research it
again... and Ill post some more....
