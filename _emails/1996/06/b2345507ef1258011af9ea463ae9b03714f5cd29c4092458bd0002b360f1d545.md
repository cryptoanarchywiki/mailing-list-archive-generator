Where does the money come from to run this proxy?

Consider two sites, one which acts as a proxy and cache but which
charges something under a penny per page, and another which acts for
free.  Won't the for-pay site be able to afford a larger disk, more
servers, and better net connections?  It will be a superior service.

Micropayments will allow new services and improved quality over what we
have today where we have to rely on charity and advertising as
motivations for much of what we find on the web.
