I think we are in violent agreement....

The item of issue, between physical and virtual terrorism attacks 
is the  fact the government either is, or wants to give the distinct 
perception that they are, ill-prepared to counter for the types of 
potentials wide-spread Internet-based virtual attacks.  And that the  
intelligence channels they have in place to detect possible movement 
of physical attacks may not fit the "Internet" model.

In addition, the US legal system is ill-prepared to deal with the
prosecutory issues surrounding this type of "terrorism".
