That is very true.  He is clueless and unrepentantly so.  His private e-mail
to me indicates it in spades.  (As well as being rude and insulting for even
challenging his claims about the program.)

True.  I was not aware that the author of the program had warned against
using it as well.  Evidently this guy did not read that part as well...
