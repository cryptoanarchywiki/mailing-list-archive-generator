It seems to me that since paying people funds that were stolen from them 
would produce good publicity, which by definition could be argued to be 
spending it on the campaign.  Sure, it's a non-traditional tactic, but that 
doesn't mean it's in violation of the campaign law.  They could also email 
along a set of libertarian literature, and the recipient would certify that 
he would promote the libertarian cause and work for the election of the 
candidate, etc, etc.

As for "lawyers and accountants":  I'm sure there are enough 
libertarian-leaning lawyers and accountants around who would be willing to 
help out to make this project a net positive.  Remember, the publicity is 
the important thing.
