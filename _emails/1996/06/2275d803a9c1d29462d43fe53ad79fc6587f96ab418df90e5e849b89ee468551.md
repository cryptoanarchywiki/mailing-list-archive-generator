Because it's not strictly true.  Implicit in traffic analysis is looking
at the "envelopes" of the traffic.  Since this means intercepting those
envelopes, once you've put your monitor on the first remailer at a site,
you've probably gotten all the rest at the site for free.

I don't think multiple remailers at the same site help anything.
