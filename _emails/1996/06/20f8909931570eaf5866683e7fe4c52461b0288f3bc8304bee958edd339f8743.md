The problem with encryption is that 1) it takes effort, and so 2) you
must have a non-empty threat model.  With (2), you have to trust that
you're really encrypting, which takes 3) a certain sense of paranoia.

For most people, all three are lacking, which is why proposals like
s/mime are succeeding.  One button, no security, encryption.
