NEWS

The second hearing on the Burns/Leahy Pro-CODE bill (S.1726) brought down
the house in the Senate this past Wednesday.  With a number of firsts
(first cyber-simulcast of a Senate hearing, first time testimony was submitted
purely through a WWW page) this is a monumental event.

But wait!  If you missed this standing room only event, you can still attend
virtually by visiting the hearing wrapup page at http://www.crypto.com/
There you will find the two hour RealAudio transcripts of the audio portion
of the day, links to online copies of many witnesses written testimony, and
some photos taken at the hearing.
