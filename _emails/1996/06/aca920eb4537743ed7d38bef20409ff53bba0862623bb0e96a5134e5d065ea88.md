There are two main issues, export and patent.  Export laws keep it from
being used outside the U.S., and patent laws keep it from being used
within the U.S.  Everyone else should have no problem.

According to discussion on the coderpunks list, this is not presently
possible:

However as has been mentioned here a PGP/MIME mail type could
theoretically be used to activate a handler for that incoming mail.  I
don't know exactly how this would work.  Glancing at the netscape plug
docs near <URL:
http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/handbook/plugins/ > it appears
that plugins are activated on HTML page downloads, not (necessarily) on
mail receipt.  So unless you typically find your incoming mail on a web
page, it doesn't look like this will work.  I will ask about it on
coderpunks for clarification.

Sorry, can't help you here.

Agree!
