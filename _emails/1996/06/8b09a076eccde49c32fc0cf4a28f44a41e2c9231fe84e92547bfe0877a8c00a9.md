An US DoJ attorney, but that may not say much.

We discussed this doctine, but it was pointed out to me that as long
as they can come up with some plausible alternative reason for having
the information related to the intercept (say, they were bugging some
suspicious neighbor and "accidentally" tap the wrong phone line) then
I would never find out that the real intercept ever took place.

By law, technically, the phone company/tapping party would have to
let me know that I had been tapped in 30 days.  In practice, I wonder.

Yes.  We discussed this part too.
