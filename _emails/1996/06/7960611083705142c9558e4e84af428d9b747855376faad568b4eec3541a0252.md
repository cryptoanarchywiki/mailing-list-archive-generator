	now, why would anyone want to send Perry a PerryGram?  --Perry's prose is 
    far too elegant to warrant criticism, particularly the closing remark!

= Your attitude seems to be "you can't prove anything so you must assume 
= that they are innocent." My attitude is "I can't prove anything so 
= they can't go to jail, but that doesn't mean I have to believe that 
= they are innocent -- in fact, I'm an idiot if I believe that." 
=  
= > I think that given Perry's ad-hominem attacks and the fact that this 
= > has nothing to do with cryptography that its about time someone sent 
= > Perry a Perry-gram. 
=  
= Cypherpunks no longer is a cryptography mailing list. Its a sewer. 
=  
= Perry
