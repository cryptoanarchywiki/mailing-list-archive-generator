Public key authentication could go a long way toward solving the military
and contractor's security problems.  However, they won't use public key
authentication for unclassified systems until it is available in "COTS"
(Commercial, Off The Shelf) software.  And it won't be available there
until it can be exported as well as sold domestically.  Catch-22
