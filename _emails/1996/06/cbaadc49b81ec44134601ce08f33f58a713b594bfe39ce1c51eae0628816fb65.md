	absolutely.  if you are being "bootlegged" on a basic conceptual patent by a 
    class of users which are impossible to either regulate or litigate (individual 
    users), might as well maximize your advantage --in this case, the combination of 
    the privacy aware and the intense effort of the government to suppress 1,2,4, and 
    5 combined for a reward of public awareness which would be difficult to attain 
    any other way, particularly for free --I seriously doubt that even saturation 
    advertising time during superbowl would be effctive! (joe sixpack audience)!

=
	free knowledge is a state of mind. free software takes away the "American" 
    work ethic incentive. when a nation state (or state or world, etc) decides to 
    appropriate the work of a class of entreprenuers (say software developers), there 
    will be no more creative productive results; few, if any, programmers will work 
    14-20 hours per day, 7 days a week for what could be several years unless they 
    are: 

	    a)  crazy (good possibility); 
	    b)  deranged (more than a few whom I know fit this class)
	    c)  obsessed (goes with the turf)
	    d)  hoping to swing on the brass ring (not the gold ring).

	I never met or hired a "real old-style hacker" programmer who did not fit 
    _ALL_ 4 of the above categories and was not obnoxious as well.  It is the same 
    difference which separates real hackers from programmers:

	    a)  what languages do hackers use?

		    any, except they do not waste time on x86 

	    b)  where do you find hackers?

		    in a (usually rented) place in the Valley (pick one) in a room 
		    littered with old newspapers and fast food bags, lit only by the 
		    glow of a CRT...

	    c)  what's the real difference between hackers and programmers?

		    programmers code; hackers tweak!
 
= But yes, software patents do mostly suck....
=
	that's the basic idea.  the only useful patents are like those owned by RSA 
    which protect a fundamental principal.  The rest of softwware success is 
    marketing and intimidating anyone who copies your basic ideas which are protected 
    by intellectual property rights --often more valuable than a patent.  

	The RSA saga was first published in Scientific America in Aug of 1977  --it's 
    been a long, and expensive, road which may yet pan out before the basic patent 
    expires in 2001 or so.
