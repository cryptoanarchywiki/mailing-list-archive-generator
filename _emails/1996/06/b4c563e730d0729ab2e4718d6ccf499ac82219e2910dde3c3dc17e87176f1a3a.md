How can you do this currently?  (With applets in browsers, I mean.)

Well, it's not perfect, but I hold out the hope that real support for some
capability assignments can be provided by the time a serious infrastructure
of certificate authorities of some sort can develop.

Note also that this is not only a Sun issue; Netscape has to support it
all too.  Currently, note that the HotJava browser already allows some
configuration to the Security Manager that Netscape doesn't.

Huh?  They're explicitly saying that they won't make any attempt to prevent
signed applets from doing anything they want to do, if you tell the thing
that you trust a particular certificate.  Thus, you are now able to grant
complete trust to an applet with a given certificate.  You can't readily
do that now.

This means that if you trust the certificate system itself, then allowing
an applet from Borland or Microsoft or IBM to do whatever it wants to your
machine is about the same risk as allowing a program on CD-ROM from Borland
or Microsoft or IBM to do whatever it wants to your machine.

I think you need to explain this; it seems to have nothing to do with
the issue at hand.

Based on the state of the Borland Java stuff I've seen, I wouldn't have 
very high expectations in the Delphi department.

And for some applications (webish ones included or not) that's actually
a very good reason.  Business is business.
