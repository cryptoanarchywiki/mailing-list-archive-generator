Then how can Sun claim that their system is
1. Exportable
2. Does RC-4 and DES?

The Java Crypto AIP presentation slides that are available on Sun's website
clearly make both claims.

Unfortunately, the feedback address that Sun provides in the slides is
unknow to their mailserver (at least it was last week) and no further
information seem to be avaiable about their "public and open" policy.

Confused,
