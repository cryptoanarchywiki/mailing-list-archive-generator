A very curious omission!  It seems to me that if they're trying to explain 
any sort of limits on encryption, they should focus carefully on WHY those 
limits should exist, and why, exactly, those limits should be selected at 
any particular level.

I can think of a much better "ultimate check on preventing its use for such 
purposes."
