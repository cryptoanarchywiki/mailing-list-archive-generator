The newsgroup "alt.anonymous.messages" has existed for a year or two, and
serves to be working reasonably well as a message pool. Check it out.

One will find numerous messages of the sort copied below. Having browsed
some of the less common newsgroups (and trolled, in my my earlier days), I
surmise that messages to nyms like "TheBear" are related to "support and
recovery" sorts of topics. (I mention this because this is a compelling
example of where anonymity is often sought; that people are using remailers
and message pools to communicate is interesting. When Louis Freeh claims
that remailers are only being used by hackers and Russian mafia arms
exporters, this is a counterexample.)

Here's just one such message, of several I saw this morning in
"alt.anonymous.messages". (Note that anonymous message pool sorts of
messages also appear directly from time to time in groups like
"alt.abuse.recovery" and that ilk.)
