The upshot of the attached missive is quite simple, really.

RSVP to Julie Rackliffe, mailto://RACKLIFFE@tcm.org , before say, 2PM EDT on
Monday, and tell her you're coming. Stragglers aren't frowned on, but we
need to do a some capacity planning beforehand. Wanna make sure we print up
enough drink tickets, alert the kitchen and the police, and all that.

Get on your best bib and tucker (jackets and ties for men, "appropriate
business attire" for women).

Go to the Harvard Club, 1 Federal Street, Boston, on Thursday, June 20, 1996
from 5-8 pm.

Collect your two complementary drink tickets.

Thank the folks from OSF, who're sponsoring our first-ever DCSB networking
event.

Hit the table of complementary munchies for some necessary sustenance.

Head to the bar, cash in one (or both) of your drink tickets and...

.................schmooze.



Easy, you say?

Show us how easy.

Be there.


Aloha,
Bob Hettinga
