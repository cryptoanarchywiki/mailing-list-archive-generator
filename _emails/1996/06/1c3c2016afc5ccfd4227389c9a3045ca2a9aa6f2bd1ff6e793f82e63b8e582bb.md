Which reminds me...

About that NTT chip:  While I haven't been looking particularly carefully 
for it, I haven't noticed an announcement in any of the electronics 
magazines I normally read.  Has anyone seen a reference to it?

I think we ought to learn more about it:  Does it implement an open 
standard, so that other manufacturers can build compatible phones?
