        I am amused (though I am not taking sides) by the general lack of
attention or rhetoric that "crypto-anarchists"/"crypherpunks"/whatever,
otherwise privacy respecting people, usually espouse.

        If someone found out all the medical information of cypherpunks list
members and distributed about the Net, how would people feel? (This is a
rhetorical question, and I am familiar and agree with some of the arguments
regarding public interest, public figures, copyright isn't a privacy
protecting mechanism, yada yada yada. Just something to think about, what if
large corporations, public interest groups, lobbeys, or governments can use
this as a precedent against "us".)
