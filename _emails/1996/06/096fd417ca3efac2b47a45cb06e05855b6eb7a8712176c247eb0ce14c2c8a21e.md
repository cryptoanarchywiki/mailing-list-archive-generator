Much easier - with each card, store its ownership history. EACH time it
is transfered, have 
it be signed by the previous owner.  Originally, the game company signs
it as a valid card. 
On selling it, they record the purchaser's identity (email address,
etc)and seal the card 
with the company key (or set of keys - see above). Repeat as needed.
