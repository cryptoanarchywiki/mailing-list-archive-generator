"Neil, the government wouldn't tap the phones of American Reporters"
- Hedrick Smith to his NYT colleague Neil Sheehan, while working
on the Pentagon Papers project - he was incorrect, and his phones
_were_ being tapped....

CSPAN-2 is doing a 25-year retrospective on the Pentagon Papers this week;
Daniel Ellsberg, Hedrick Smith, and others were on tonight,
with people from other sides on later this week.  Cool show so far!
