        PRZ is becoming a businessman.  Nothing wrong about that --
business is what makes the cars shine and the toilets flush.  To me,
however, it seems self-servingly pious to seek to reclaim previously sold
rights on the grounds that a corporate customer should not have the right
to set up an escrow key for company communications.

        There's another debate due about whether an employee should have
the right to also -- on company time, over company nets, etc. -- use e-mail
with a private (non-escrowed) encryption to secure personnal
communications.  I, predicably, think the employee should have such a right
-- as part of the permissible and acceptable "personal space" allowed an
employee.  (Just as he/she should be allowed to make unmonitored personal
phone calls, and go to the bathroom when the urge strikes.)  Today, this
level of privilege is probably an artifact of white collar or professional
employment;  not an employee's or citizen's right, but rather a perk
associated with the independence granted a valued employee who expects and
demands it.

        That's an argument that should be laughed out of court.  And off
the Net even sooner.  (Although Phil is so much of a hero to most of us,
for his own productive efforts and for having endured the DoJ's squeeze, he
probably got an outrageously tolerant hearing on alt.security.pgp.)

        Balderdash! There is nothing corrupt or nasty about escrow, per se
-- the issue is who gets access to the escow key and under what conditions.
If the legitimate owner of the protected information totally controls the
escrow key, there is no issue.  In business communications, key escow is
just another dimension in backup.

        There is a demand for escrow.  For a while, seven or eight years
ago, I collected tales of all the weak commercial crypto system which were
then being busted.  One of the most striking things was the number -- four
or five commercial products that I recall, Lotus 1,2,3 being the most
prominent -- which were cracked by legitimate administrators desperate to
retrieve something encypted by an employee who had lost his/her key.

        Suerte,
