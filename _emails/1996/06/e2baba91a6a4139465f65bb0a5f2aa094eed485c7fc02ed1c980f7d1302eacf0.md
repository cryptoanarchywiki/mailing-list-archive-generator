Just read that the Supreme Court "struck down provisions of the 1992
Cable Act that require local cable companies to either ban indecent
shows from appearing on leased or access channels or place all
programs deemed indecent on a single channel and block it. Those
provisions violate free-speech rights, the court said. But the court
said Congress lawfully can permit cable operators to choose not to
broadcast such programs on leased access channels." [NYT]

Looks like the gov't will lose if it decides to appeal the CDA
decision.
