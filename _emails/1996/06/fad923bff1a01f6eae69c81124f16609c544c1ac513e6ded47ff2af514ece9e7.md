And sign up for a free trip to the roundup of people who want privacy. Coming
soon to a police state near you. WHY THE FUCK DO THEY NEED TO KNOW YOUR
NAME FOR THIS SHIT??? WHY IS NO ONE ASKING THIS???

Look carefully at who's sponsoring this. Who are they, and where does
the money come from? Hint: three letters.

Notice how they don't use PGP to sign the msg? Wonder why?
