-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I suffer from the great misfortune of a dos computer, and despite my
anti-micro$oft efforts, I still am stuck, most of the time, with Windows
95. This OS assigns long filenames (the sensible kind, that is) to the
old-style eight-character and three-character separated by a dot. However,
they did it in such a way that old filenames still work. So if I have a 
file I want to encrypt, PGP will mess up this system.

oldname.txt -> oldname.asc

This is the normal way PGP would encrypt. However, f I have assigned the 
oldname.txt file a new file name under the win95 system, it will look
something like this.

"Old File" (oldfil~1.txt)

This conforms with the new scheme. If I PGP encrypt, this happens:

oldfil~1.txt -> oldfil~1.asc

Thus, the new filename is lost, both for the ciphered file, and for
the file once I decrypt. Is there a way (aside from not using long
filenames) such as a hacked version of PGP that has a workaround for
this problem? Also, is this an issue on the list of improvements for
future official versions of PGP?
