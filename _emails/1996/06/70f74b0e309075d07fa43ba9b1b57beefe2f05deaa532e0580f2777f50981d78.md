I think it would be interesting to see how copyright law will be applied to the
Web if micropayments ever become popular.  Would memory or disk caching be
considered fair use?  If so, then people could just set up a very large disk
cache and maybe delete it every month or so.  It would also be a pretty neat
hack to use a proxy that only cached pages that charged micropayments.
Companies would not make a lot of money from things like this.  If disk caching
was not considered to be fair use, people would still turn it on anyway.
