I use a lisp package for emacs that I wrote to automatically verify
signatures on incoming mail, so I already see the 10% of messages
which are improperly signed displayed in a red "bad signature" font.
Thus, I'd have no need of this service.

Further, it makes philisophical/political sense to me to have
verification distributed.  Every node should be doing it's own
security.

Be aware of CC's before replying to this.
