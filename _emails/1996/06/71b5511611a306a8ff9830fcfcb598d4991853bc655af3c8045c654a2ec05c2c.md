Has there been any news recently about what's going on with commercial
versions of PGP? I've been toying with the idea of buying the Windows
version from ViaCrypt just to have a PGP that doesn't need to shell out to
DOS each time it runs, but I'm curious as to where, if anywhere, things seem
to be going.
