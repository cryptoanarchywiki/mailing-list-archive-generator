Timothy, 

For the first time in my life I agree with you. I am 13 and the cop here a
assholes. I have been caught about 13 times, yelled at me called my parents
who could give a rat's ass. I feel spend tax payer's money on more cops to
catch the bastard who kill people, not on the kids who just like to take a
walk with my girlfriend. Or when I'm going to the corner store to buy a
6-pack. A 6-pack of coke. Well as the old saying goes, fuck this and
everything that has to do with it!!!!!!!!
