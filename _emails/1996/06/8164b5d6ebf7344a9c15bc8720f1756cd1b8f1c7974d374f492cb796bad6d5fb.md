The right to anonymity on the Net got a big boost during the Q&A at the
ACLU press conference here in NYC on the CDA win -- with a recitation of
its distinguished history in assuring freedom of speech and political
activity. As did the corollary right to strong encryption to assure
protection from intruders of gov-biz-jealous-lovers of all stripes. 
 
 
The CDA decision is a wondrous read for its coverage of so many topics
discussed here; each judge's opinion is separately admirable. 
 
 
And, based, on the remarks of panelists at the conference, it will surely
advance privacy protection measures and support loosening of crypto
controls. 
 
 
But still subject to the unpredictable Supremes, a Solomon cautioned, if
DoJ elects to appeal.
