demonstrates that the govt. is not capable of admininistering sensitive 
information properly even when it is what must surely count as the most

security system is based on principles of security clearances and "need to 
know". But how does the guardian of various personal files know _who_ needs to 
know?

This is a _very_ hard problem, one that I for one would like an answer to.
Unfortunately the USGovt is not like a computer system where the authorisation
