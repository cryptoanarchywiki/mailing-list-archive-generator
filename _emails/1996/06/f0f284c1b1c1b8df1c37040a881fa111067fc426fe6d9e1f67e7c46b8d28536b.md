I just got a piece of junk snail with these words on it. It's an ad for
"Financial Technology World Conference 1996". Highlight:

Luncheon Speaker, September 17, 12:30-1:30 pm
Dr. Nathaniel Borenstein
Chief Scientist
First Virtual Holdings, Inc
As Chief Scientist of First Vortual Holdings, Nathaniel Borenstein created
the first operational Internet payment system.

It includes his picture. What can I say... I wouldn't buy a falafel in the
street from this guy. :-)

The conference is run my Miller Freeman, (212) 615-2765.

I considered coming to heckle him, until I saw that this isn't even free:

CONFERENCE FEES
Fee is $795 per person...

I suppose the audience will be limited to the people willing to pay lots
of money to listen to Dr. Nathaniel.

Very amused,
