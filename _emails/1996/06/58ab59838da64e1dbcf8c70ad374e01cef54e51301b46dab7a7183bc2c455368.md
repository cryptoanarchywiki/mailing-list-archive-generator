This, the curfew situation, is yet another of the reasons I'd favor "playing 
hardball" with the government.  I'm very much against discriminatory 
enforcement, but on the other hand I don't think my liberty should be 
dependent on getting an organization like the ACLU to look out for and 
complain against discrimination against me. 
 
I feel if a group of left-handed albinos think the police are being too hard 
on left-handed albinos, they shouldn't have to convince the ACLU of this, 
and should be entitled and able to fight back effectively and prevent what 
they view as abuse.  True, such a situation may occasionally lead to abuses, 
but I strongly expect that those abuses will be far fewer than the current 
system.
