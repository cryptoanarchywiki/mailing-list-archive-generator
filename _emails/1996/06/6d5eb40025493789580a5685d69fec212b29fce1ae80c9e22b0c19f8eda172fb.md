I disagree.  I think the main reason that postage has not appeared for
remailers is that there is no good way to integrate Chaumian cash into
applications.  Now, with two (count 'em!) libraries for ecash starting
to become available, we will hopefully see people working to put ecash
code into MUAs, remailers, etc.
