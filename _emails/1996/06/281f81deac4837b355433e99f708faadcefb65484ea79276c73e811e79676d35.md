I wish there were some keyword or set of filter-rules so that 
I could eliminate all discussion of government, politics
(including the assassinine kind), policy, export, GAK, TLA's and
cetera from my cpunks inbox.


I really could care less at this point about any of the opinions
that any of the cpunks contributors have on any of those
subjects.  It all amounts to some combination of a) whining and
b) preaching to the choir.


I should just hurry up and implement my "c2punks" NoCeM-style
ratings.  In my spare time.

Hahaha!  "My spare time"!  That was a good one...
