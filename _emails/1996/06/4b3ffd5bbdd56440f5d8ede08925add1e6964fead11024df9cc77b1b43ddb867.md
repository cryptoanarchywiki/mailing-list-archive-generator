To understand where "They" think they are coming from, you have to compare
Apples-to-Apples.  The concern is the medium of choice; the Internet and it's
high availability of anonymity, coupled with its access to large amounts of
computer systems available via one virtual channel.

A well orchestrated and well researched attack by the right folk, as the thought
process goes, could in-fact, potentially affect large amounts of critical
computer systems within a short period of time. And while the government
has inroads available to identify potential physical terrorists threats,
they do not feel as prepared for the virtual ones.
