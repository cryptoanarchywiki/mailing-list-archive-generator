The beta release of asendmail is now available from:

http://www.cyberpass.net/~ncognito/asendmail.tar.gz

The compressed archive is about 13k.

Included are the current proxys.conf and a sample fakes.conf file, along
with pretty decent instructions for use with and without mix. 

I'll be out of town for the next 2 days, so I'll not be responding to
email until monday.

Adios.. 

Ben
