that's the guy.

the nightline segment certainly failed to convey that concept, but it
was what I raised in my post. in fact
it was all virtually touted as a great reason for new stringent intellectual
property laws by the reporter. "the fbi's hands are tied" he might have
even said.

probably the same one based on new elements that have just been discovered.
I missed the first half of the show but I think it was based on a new
book.

Klaus, I have seen many debates on this list and weren't what I was
talking about. this list has very little influence on public policy
as you might imagine <g>  ok, I will get flamed for that, but frankly
the public perception of cypherpunks is as a bunch of anarchists.

I mean public opinion pieces in newspapers, policy
journals, the washington talking-heads circuit like "meet the press",
etc-- but we will probably be getting that soon. except the topic
will be "what do we do about evil infoterrorists", instead of
"are evil infoterrorists a real problem". "does intellectual
property really exist, and if so what is it"  "do we actually need
new laws to create a new class of infocriminals"

>In the case I described, involving Intel and Pentium plans and a recent

sure sounds similar though. the guy on nightline went to brazil. maybe
that's all some juicy new info that you haven't gotten yet through 
any of your "blacknet" sources. heh heh. not too often I scoop the
ILF. <g>

yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about, Klaus (speaking of crossing
wires, my name is Vladimir, Vlad for short). don't understand your
fetish of calling people different names, does that have something
to do with that crypty-anarchy stuff or something? just curious.
