I find this analysis a bit superficial because it does not consider the
difference between short-term and long-term value.  To use Perry's example
of the timber industry.  Before the late 1980s, the lands owned by Pacific
Lumber were managed for long-term production.  When the company was taken
over as part of the "maximize present value" movement in the late 1980s,
the management goals changed to increase timber production without regard
to long-term production.  (I seem to remember that the takeover was one of
Michael Milken's deals.)

My conclusion from this example is that if your interest is in the
long-term preservation of ecosystems, you need institutions that are
structured so they take a long-term view, and can not be subverted by
short-term trends in markets.  As far as I can tell, the US National Park
Service, for all its faults, does as good a job of preserving ecosystems as
any other institution, and better than most.  (If you disagree, please
provide examples of institutions that do as well.)
