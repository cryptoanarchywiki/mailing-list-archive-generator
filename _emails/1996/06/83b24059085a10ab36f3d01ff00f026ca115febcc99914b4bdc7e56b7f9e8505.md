I thought md5 was slower than that, but I'm only going by my
(addmitedly poor) memory of some comments in the tripwire docs. I'll
give it a go sometime.

One annoying think about the md4 implementation that I have is that on
little endian machines it byte reverses the words in the buffer its
hashing so I need to make a copy of the buffer each time. Is there a
version of md4 that doesn't do this?

Cheers, Andrew
