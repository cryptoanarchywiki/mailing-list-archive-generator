In 1996, the Libertarian Party will apparently qualify for Federal matching 
funds for its Presidential political campaign.  That does not mean that it 
will _accept_ them, being stolen goods.  However, a few years ago I heard of 
an idea that they should accept the money, and return it to the people, a 
small amount at a time, to whomever asks for it.  Besides returning the 
stolen money to its rightful owners, that would produce substantial positive 
publicity for the Libertarian party, embarrassment for the Democrats and 
Republicans, while at the same time reducing the amount of money available 
for the D's and the R's.


But there's been a practical question of how to actively do this, 
economically.  Issuing checks and mailing them costs money, and they're 
traceable, etc.    The advent of digital cash suggests an answer: Make the 
payments in the form of digital cash, payable on the Web.  This will 
encourage the use of digital cash, and provide a sudden infusion that will 
promote other uses.  There's another advantage, however.  Since "Netizens" 
are somewhat biased towards libertarianism, this will have the effect of 
keeping more of this money "in the family" as it were, while at the same 
time being open, technically, to everyone who can get on the 'net.
