HTTP servers are permitted to store up to 4k bytes of information of their
choice on your machine, which is returned to them upon request the next
time you access their system.

This allows the servers to maintain a client state which persists 
across separate accesses.  

Nothing will happen if you delete the file, other than that servers
will not remember information they stored on the client side during
your previous visits.  If you edit the file, which is binary, you may
possibly mess it up and choke the software that uses it. 

There are some minor privacy implications for "Cookies", but they 
have been discussed on the list before.
