Um, you don't read news.admin.net-abuse.misc, do you?  The first few spams
from worldnet have already happened, and from the reports I've seen on there,
the response from worldnet's posthamster has been pretty much nonexistent.
It apparently doesn't help that the 'postmaster' mailbox has a quota just
like the other mailboxen on the system, so every time someone does spam
from worldnet, half the complaint mail to postmaster bounces.
