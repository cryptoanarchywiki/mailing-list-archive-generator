	I agree with Tim May on this - it's a draconian solution to crime.
I've heard claims made that it reduces crime - I wonder if that's true and if
so, would that still be true in the long term.

	A quick web search produced a case of a teenager who broke the law
talking to a friend outside her own family's home. I guess that it wouldn't be
wise to allow a child to use a telescope outside - there goes astronomy.

	The hardest hit will probably be homeless children - especially those
who have run away from abuse - they'll be getting a criminal record if they're
caught a few times during curfew.

	Derek
