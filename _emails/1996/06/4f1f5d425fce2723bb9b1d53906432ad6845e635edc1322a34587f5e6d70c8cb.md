	It looks like I'm going to have to move the middle-man remailer.
The nym server at alpha.c2.org has been down for several days. This
directly affects the middle-man remailer. Since nymrod@nym.jpunix.com has
made it to Raph's list, I'm going to contact the admin at jpunix.com and
see if it's ok for me to point the middle-man remailer nym at his server.
Maybe it will be a little more reliable and allow the middle-man remailer
to work properly. Stay tuned for further details as they occur!

  middle-man-admin@alpha.c2.org (don't bother to reply, it doesn't work)
