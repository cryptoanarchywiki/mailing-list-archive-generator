Hi there.

  I have noticed while browsing through http://www.amazon.com
that in December 1996 a new version of "The Codebreakers" will be
published. The complete title says:
"The Codebreakers : The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication
from Ancient Times to the Internet"

Does anyone know if it will also include the complete 1967 edition,
or just the abridged 1973 one? I have managed to locate one copy of
the 1967 edition in our central library and found that there is quite
a lot of information that I fear the writer might want to ommit in this
new edition.
Does anyone have any more info about it?

Thanks a lot,
Michael Pak
Tel-Aviv
Israel.
