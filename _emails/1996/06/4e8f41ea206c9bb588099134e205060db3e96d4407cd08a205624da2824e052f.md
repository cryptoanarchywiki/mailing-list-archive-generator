San Diego Area CPUNKS symposium  Thursday, June 20th, 1996

   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at "The Mission
Cafe & Coffee Shop" were I hope to get an update of Lance Cottrell's
anonymous e-mail server, "mixmaster", exchange keys, and discuss other
topical CP stuff.  There's always the semi-topical discussions; Internet
Service Provider in San Diego (providing, anonymous remailers and other
privacy services), stelth communications, latest Cypherpunk goings-on,
Internet happenings (like recent Federal court decision).

   Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint.  If you can figure
out how to get it on the back of a business card, that would be cool.  

Place: The Mission Cafe & Coffee Shop
       3795 Mission Bl in Mission Beach.
       488-9060


Time:1800

Their Directions:
	8 west to Mission Beach Ingram Exit
	Take west mission bay drive
	Go right on Mission Blvd.

	On the corner of San Jose and mission blvd.

	It's kind of 40s looking building...  funky looking 
        (their description, not mine)

They serve stuff to eat, coffee stuff, and beer.

See you there!

New guy, bring your key fingerprint.
