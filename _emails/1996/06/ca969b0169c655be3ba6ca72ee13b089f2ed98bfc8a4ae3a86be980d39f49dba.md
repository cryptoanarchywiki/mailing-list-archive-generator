        Wonderful tale!  I can see that -- maybe, just maybe -- AOL or
another targeted online community (a semi-moderated mailing list or even a
semi-moderated newsgroup) could be slapped for just bouncing the SPAM back
at the sender.

        I bet they could get away with it, however, if they appended a
brief polite notice that this mailing exceeds some (anti-spam) perimeters
that the subscribers of AOL (or other online community) agreed -- in their
intial subscriber contracts -- to have AOL refuse for them.

        (Which text, of course, would add to the reply mail burden for the
Spammer's IAP.)

        The only meaningful control on SPAM I can see is to start enforcing
a chain of contracts that forbid it (without reference to content) from the
backbone back through the IAPs to the users.  (I think Long-Morrow at Yale
had a nice paper on this a couple of years back.) But this sort of
auto-return mechanism could make a dent on the super-Spanners now.

        Yea for AOL!

        Suerte,
                        _Vin
