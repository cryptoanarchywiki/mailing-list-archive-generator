So I didn't see any move top 'restrict crypto' in the two wire stories.
It looked like the return of clipper with escrow agents other than government
which seems *almost* reasonable when I note that they are not mandating any of

Still given the close relationship between Cheltenham and Ft Mead one is left
wondering what the real story is ...
