Yes, it's true.  I happen to believe that the only purpose the government 
had in granting patents on public key and RSA is to help keep it from the 
public.  They did a fair job, but the patents expire in 1-4 years and it'll 
be too late by then.  Their attempts to foist the Clipper standard on us 
didn't work.
