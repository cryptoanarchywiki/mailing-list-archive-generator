A true, but irrelevant.  The correct dichotomy is between
demographic data on big spenders and anonymous big spenders.
Yes, it would be nice to have demographics on everyone, but
demographics are secondary to sales.

Of course, there are other ways to get demographics and 
other ways to target advertising and other ways to get
big spenders into your store.

And I bet they don't turn down your cash just because it
contains no demographic data.  Thus demonstrating the 
pragmatism of the market with regard to anonymity.
