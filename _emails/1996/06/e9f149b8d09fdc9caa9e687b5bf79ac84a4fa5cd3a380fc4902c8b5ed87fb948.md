OK, I think I misunderstood.  You were talking about encrypting a file that
has already been compressed and I was talking about an encryption program that
would compress then encrypt.  In the latter case, headers would be completely
unnecessary, whereas in the former, they are necessary.  Generally, checksums
or parity bits are much better ways of checking if the decryption was
successful.  While this does make cryptanalysis easier, a known-plaintext will
not work.
