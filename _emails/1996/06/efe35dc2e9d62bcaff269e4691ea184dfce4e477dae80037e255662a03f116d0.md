If you look at the inside back cover of the book you'll find
instructions for ordering the diskette, just as there were with
Edition 1.  Distributing the diskette with the book was too much trouble for
the publisher, given the ITAR issues.  The disks that Phil Karn applied
for export permission for had just the code from the book typed in,
and not any other material that may have been on the official disks,
but they still denied it.

As far as EMP goes, there are three interesting kinds of EMP generators
1) Nuclear weapons, detonated at high altitude to get wide spread
        EMP effects.  The folks who drop such things generally
        clear out of the territory very fast before the explosion.
2) Mythical portable devices for attacking computer facilities -
        the folks who set off these don't exist, so they don't
        need to worry about the effects.
3) Very large capacitor/inductor banks at defense contractors like 
        Harry Diamond Labs in New Mexico, which are used to test
        electronic equipment (up to airplane size) for EMP-resistance.  
        They're supposedly quite impressive structures (the buildings 
        used for the equipment under test are all wood) and the folks
        who run them are careful about lots of things when using them.
