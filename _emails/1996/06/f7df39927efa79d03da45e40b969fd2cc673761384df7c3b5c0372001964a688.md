Ben:
   If you can, you may want to get a hold of this book:

   Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier
   John Wiley & Sons, Inc. ISBN 0-471-59756-2

   It is a very good reference that will show you what the public 'state 
of the art' is.  [You might find that you have recreated something that 
has already been broken, or see weaknesses in your cipher like other 
cryptosystems in the book that have their faults exposed...]

    Happy hunting and hacking,
    Brian Durham
