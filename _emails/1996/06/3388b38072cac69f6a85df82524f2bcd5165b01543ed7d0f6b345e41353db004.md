Sorry Jim, I did not get that at all in the past.  I assumed a 
context where the inner workings of AP would not be well understood 
by the population while here, you seems to indicate that everybody 
would operate under the threat / deterrance of mutual anihilation 
principle.

A argued that an impulsive guy might target somebody unjustifiably 
while I overlooked that he could think twice before doing so.  But by 
his nature, being a violent or thug at heart, he will understand this 
"peace based on threat" maybe even better than a pacifist at heart.  
So, my arguments might not stand.  

Have any constructive comments? (hey, just play devil's advocate from 
time to time :)
