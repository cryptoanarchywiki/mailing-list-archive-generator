Right, and I bet Clinton really believes what someone wrote for him to 
wax political on. :->

If Clinton really thinks that Cyberspace is the Second Coming, then 
explain to me CLIPPER's 1,2 and 3, Janet Reno, Dorothy Denning, the CDA, 
etc.

Exercising dominion over this medium for the excuse of protecting us from 
the bad guys is yet another lame excuse for tossing out what little 
freedoms we have allowed to be legislated away. The mere fact, that 
cryptography is considered a hinderance to "protecting the citizenry" by 
this administration is tantamount to declaring war on personal privacy.

When his legislative efforts actually fall in line with believable 
rhetoric, then maybe I'll pay more attention. Up to date, he has 
demonstrated his true character, or lack thereof, between what he says 
and what he and his Clintonistas do.

This presumes that Cyberspace is regulated to begin with. I have yet to 
see anyone apply a litmus test that equally covers all jurisdictions and 
geopolitical climes. Last time I looked, Cyberspace was more "west of the 
Pecos" than any other communications medium that is generally available - 
which IMO is one of the last places that the first amendment actually 
still applies.

As for surviving deregulation, I would be more worried about the coming 
stock market crash and the devaluation of the worthless currency we carry 
in our pockets. Industry comes and goes with changes in technology, and 
the legal system continues on in the never ending effort to block 
progress and prop up self-serving ends.

10 years from now, many of the "regulated" industries we hold dear may 
not even exist in recognizable form.
