You bet.  PC stuff is essential.  Here in Tucson, the cops came up with a
novel, simple, cheap, and efficacious method to determine cocaine HCl usage:
Put a strip of Scotch (TM) tape across the nostrils of a
suspectee/apprehendee and see if there's any toot on it.

Local judges disallowed this procedure because, in the absence of a
substantial presence of African-Americans in the "community" (they comprise
<2% of local population), almost all of those arrested were
Hispanic-surnamed Latinos.
