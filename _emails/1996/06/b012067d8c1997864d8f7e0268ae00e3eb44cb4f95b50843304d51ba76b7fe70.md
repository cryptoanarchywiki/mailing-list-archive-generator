James Bamford mentions the BRUSA/UKUSA agreements in _The Puzzle Palace_
(p. 393ff. in mine). It doesn't say anything about nuclear secrets, but the
discussion does touch on cryptanalysis, COMINT and other technology (radar,
DF, etc.). From Bamford's description, it sounds as if each country just
agreed to be bound by the other's security regulations insofar as how they
handled material. This isn't uncommon. (Of course, that means that stuff
the Brits provided the US wasn't subject to the usual classification
review. . .)

As far as Constitutional abuses, there were much worse ones on the horizon
(e.g., the internment of Japanese-Americans). War hysteria provides fertile
ground to sow the seeds of FUD. (Gee, maybe that explains the "war on
drugs," the "war on crime," the "war on pornography". . .)
