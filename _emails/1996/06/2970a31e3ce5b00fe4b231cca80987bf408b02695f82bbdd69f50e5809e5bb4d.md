I don't think this is true given a brute force attack.  Let me assume
DES-CBC as a specific system.  Let us assume that the plaintext is:

  IV || PKZIP2.1 || <compressed data>

Where IV is the 8 byte initialization vector.

The brute force system decrypts the first, and second blocks (8 bytes each)
of the cyphertext, XORs them, and compares the result with "PKZIP2.1".  If
the comparison is equal it has the key.

If we eliminated the header and just started with the compressed data, then
the brute force system would have to decrypt and decompress enough of the
data to run statistical tests.  The cost of the additional decryptions,
decompression, and statistical tests substantially raise the cost of the
brute force attack.
