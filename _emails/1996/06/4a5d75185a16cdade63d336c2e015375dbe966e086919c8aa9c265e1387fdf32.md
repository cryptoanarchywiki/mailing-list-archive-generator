While I appreciate your...uh...appreciation, let me remind you that part of 
my "pronouncements" are that the current political and social system is 
sick.  Many people around here seem to agree with this assessment.  What I 
advocate is a comparatively simple change in the rules that could have the 
effect of vastly changing the way things are done.  Whether these changes 
are in "the best interests of the inhabitants of this nation" is still an 
open question, and many people have agreed with me on this matter.
