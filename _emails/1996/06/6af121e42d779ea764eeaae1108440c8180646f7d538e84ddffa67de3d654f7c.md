   Thanks to MF: 
 
 
   The Washington Post, June 24, 1996. 
 
 
   Dear Ann Landers: 
 
   You have recently printed letters from people whose spouses 
   have left them for people they met on the Internet. 
 
   As a 55-year-old who has been happily married for 33 years, 
   I am living proof that the vast majority of us Internet 
   fans use our computers to browse newspapers, see the 
   treasures of the Sistine Chapel, check the weather in 
   Vermont or read the latest Batman comic. I think your 
   readers should be assured that almost all Americans on-line 
   have no intention of stealing someone else's spouse or 
   leaving their own. 
 
   Just as reckless and irresponsible drivers should not ruin 
   it for drivers who act responsibly, neither should a few 
   bored Web crawlers foul up the Internet for the rest of us. 
 
   -- Sen. Patrick Leahy (D Vt.) 
 
 
   Dear Pat: 
 
   You are a superb senator. Vermont is lucky to have you. As 
   an advice columnist, however, you aren't so hot. Granted, 
   most Web crawlers are fairly decent people, but many are 
   not interested in the Sistine Chapel or Batman. The 
   Internet is tailor-made for con men, the lonely and the 
   bored. The word from here is beware. More on this subject 
   tomorrow. 
 
   [Ann's two letters today exemplify the grief and joy of 
   betrayal and love on the Net.] 
 
   Questions may be sent to: Ann Landers, c/o Creators 
   Syndicate, 5777 W. Century Blvd., Suite 700, Los Angeles, 
   Calif. 90045.
