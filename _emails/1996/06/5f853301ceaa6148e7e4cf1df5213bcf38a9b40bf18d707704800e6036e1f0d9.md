Mmm hmm. Sure. And the Titanic was unsinkable, except for that
damned iceberg. And does anyone remember the great train robbery
of Britain? I could go on forever. There are no absolutes,
especially in cryptography. I would be willing to bet that the 
Safe Mail execs encrypt their company mail with PGP. Maybe some
day, in my spare five minutes, I'll crack it - but I'll have
to be really damn bored. And why would I bother - you've already
proven its fault.

I accept anonymous mail. If I didn't sign it, you don't know I wrote it.
