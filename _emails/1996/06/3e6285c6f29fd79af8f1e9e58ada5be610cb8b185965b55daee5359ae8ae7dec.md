Greetings!

As those who attended yesterday's lunch already know, We Have A Date!

I am simply delighted to announce that Open Software Foundation has generously
agreed to sponsor our first ever cocktail party for the Digital Commerce
Society
of Boston. I promises to be a memorable evening and I hope that you will
plan to
come, and please feel free to introduce a friend to this unique group. Our
intention is that this event should be used as a networking opportunity in
addition to getting some more people interested in DCSB (and, of course,
expanding our mailing list!)

So, here's the specifics:

When:	Thursday, June 20, 1996
	5-8 pm

Where: 	The Harvard Club, One Federal Street, 38th floor
	in The Lounge (sunset over the Back Bay will be featured!)

	Hot and Cold Hors D'oeuvres ala The Harvard Club
	and cool libations compliments of OSF and DCSB.



What's the Catch?- No Catch! Just RSVP to me before June 17


Do Come!
