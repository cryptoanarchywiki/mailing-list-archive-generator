Nothing -- alas, they don't see the oppression or authority.

For better or worse, America really *is* the most free country.  We
sit here and say how much better it could be, and how awful it is
compared to that.  Others look around and say "Well, you aren't being
carried off in the middle of the night by death squads, so I'm not
going to waste my time on you when I could help other people in danger
of death."  I'm not prepared to argue against that judgement.
