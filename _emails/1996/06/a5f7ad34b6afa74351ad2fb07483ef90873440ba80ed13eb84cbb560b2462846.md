First, have fun playing with it. Second, watch out for subtle statistical
biases.

While radioactive decay is unpredictable (so are a lot of things, by the
way), there are all kinds of biases that reduce the apparent entropy.
Detector "dead time" is a classic one (basically, the detector can't detect
counts during a post-pulse recovery time...probably not a problem at low
count rates, but an example of how subtle things can sneak in).
