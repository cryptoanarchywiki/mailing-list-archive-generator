It's a violation of RSA's patent wherever RSA is patented (in the US 
only, I believe).  Doesn't matter who wrote the code, or where.

Oh yeah: PGP 2.6ui or 2.6.3i is based on US versions.  I believe they 
still use some of PRZ's code.

And don't forget that IDEA is patented by Ascom Tech AG.
