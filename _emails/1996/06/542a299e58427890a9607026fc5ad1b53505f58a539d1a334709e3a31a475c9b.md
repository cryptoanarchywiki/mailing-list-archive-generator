When I was looking for a house in Oregon, I pointed at the map and asked the 
real estate lady "Why are houses in this area cheap".  She did not give a 
straight answer I pressed her, and then she then started asking me 
questions that indicated she suspected I was an agent provocateur 
from the government trying to entrap her into revealing forbidden information.
I eventually discovered that the area in question was occupied predominantly 
by people of a particular ethnic group, but she was forbidden to tell me this 
information.  This explanation of the price disparity did not occur to me 
until she started feeling me out to see if I was a cop.

But Rich Graves does not regard that sort of thing as any violation on
freedom of speech.
