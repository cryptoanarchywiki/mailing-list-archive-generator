Check out the article on Anarchy in the 11th (or 13th) edition of the
Encyclopaedia Brittanica. It was written by Prince Kropotkin
as a philosophical argument in favor of anarchy, and the editors
saw fit to write a rebuttal footnote referring, as I recall,
to the Haymarket (Pullman?) riots.

A copy of the 11th needs to be on everyone's bookshelf.
