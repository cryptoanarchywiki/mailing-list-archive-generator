Subject: Public briefing on the NRC Crypto Policy report

     Please post widely.

     The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the
     National Research Council (NRC) has completed a congressionally
     mandated study of national cryptography policy.  The final report,
     Cryptography's Role in Securing the Information Society, was released
     to the public on May 30, 1996.

     Some members of the committee will conduct a public briefing on the
     report in
     Menlo Park, California at SRI International.  The briefing will be
     held in the Auditorium of the International Building from 10 to 11 am
     on  Wednesday, June.5.  The address is 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo
     Park, California, 94025.  For more information about the briefing at
     SRI, contact Alice Galloway at 415-859-2711
     (alice_galloway@qm.sri.com).

     If you have suggestions about other places that the committee should
     offer a public briefing, please let me know (crypto@nas.edu or
     202-334-2605).

     A summary of the report ("Overview and Recommendations") is available
     through http://www2.nas.edu/cstbweb; the full publication will be made
     available when final printed copies of the book are available
     (probably around the beginning of August).

     If you wish to be kept informed of various other public activities
     regarding dissemination of this report, you can sign up for an e-mail
     list by visiting the web page
     http://www2.nas.edu/cstbweb/notifyme.html.

     I apologize to you for the short notice on this invitation, but hope
     that you will be able to attend.

                       Herb Lin
