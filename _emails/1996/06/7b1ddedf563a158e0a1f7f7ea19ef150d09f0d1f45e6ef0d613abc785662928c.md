Probably the same way other things are counted when used to make a
political point (# of homeless people, # of date rape victims, etc.).  Make
a wild-ass guess based on a very small sample, then multiply by a factor of
10 or 100.  I think lying with statistics has become a national pastime
recently.  I tend to not trust numbers issued by folks who stand to gain
from the use of the numbers.
