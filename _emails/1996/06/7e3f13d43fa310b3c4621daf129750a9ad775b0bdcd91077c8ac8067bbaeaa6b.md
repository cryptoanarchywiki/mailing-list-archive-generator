                 The Digital Commerce Society of Boston

                               Presents

                             Peter Loshin,
                              Author of
          Electronic Commerce: Online Ordering and Digital Money


                "Electronic Commerce: The State of the Art"


                        Tuesday, June 2, 1996
                               12 - 2 PM
                   The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
                     One Federal Street, Boston, MA


Pete Loshin has been writing about networking, the Internet and electronic
commerce for the past two years; before that he worked as a TCP/IP
networking engineer for a Cambridge research lab and systems manager for a
major publishing company.  Books currently available include _Electronic
Commerce: Online Ordering and Digital Money_ and _TCP/IP for Everyone_.
Pete plans to launch an Internet commerce newsletter this fall.


The future always looks shinier, more efficient and more pleasant than the
present.  The same holds true for the future of electronic commerce, but a
lot of people are not waiting for the clean and bright future of SET and
unrestricted crypto.  They are doing business right now, over the Internet,
and what they do will affect the way we do business well into the next
century.  Electronic commerce is still largely an art, and after lunch on
Monday July 2 Pete will talk a little bit about the state of that art.



This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held on
Tuesday, July 2, 1996 from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of the
Harvard Club of Boston, One Federal Street. The price for lunch is $27.50.
This price includes lunch, room rental, and the speaker's lunch. ;-).  The
Harvard Club *does* have dress code: jackets and ties for men, and
"appropriate business attire" for women.

We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or if we *really* know
you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by
Saturday, June 29, or you won't be on the list for lunch.  Checks
payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will have to be sent
back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The Harvard
Club of Boston".

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've had
to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for instance), please
let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something out.

Planned speakers for the following few months are:

 August      Duane Hewitt     Idea Futures
 September   Tatsuo Tanaka    Some Economics of Digital Cash

We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on the
first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a presentation to the
Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program Commmittee, care of Robert
Hettinga, rah@shipwright.com .

For more information about the Digital Commerce Society of Boston, send
"info dcsb" in the body of a message to majordomo@ai.mit.edu .  If you want
to subscribe to the DCSB e-mail list, send "subscribe dcsb" in the body of a

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Robert Hettinga
