I've heard of this kind of thing before. Individuals have already been 
sent to jail for doing this, as well as doing and 
distributing kiddie porn drawings. 

I suspect that since it's already illegal on the state level, that 
Congress is looking into making it a federal crime to distribute them 
over state lines via the Internet.

It only has to give the impression of being under the age of consent in 
order to be illegal. No real models have to be involved.

That's debatable. However, in this politically correct environment, I 
wouldn't even give the impression of siding with the pedophiles if I were 
you.

I wouldn't doubt it.
