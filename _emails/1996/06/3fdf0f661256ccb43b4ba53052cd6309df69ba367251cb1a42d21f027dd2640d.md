Hmmm.... This brings up two questions:

1. If you stick to your own religion, aren't you kind of saying the others
are bad (or don't work) anyway? Its hard to be more critical than the "I'm
going to heaven and you're not, because you don't do this...." crowd.

2. Isn't hard NOT to have an opinion about something?
