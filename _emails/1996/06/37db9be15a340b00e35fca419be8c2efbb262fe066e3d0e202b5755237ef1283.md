Looking at Denning's critique (pro-escrow rant) of the NCR crypto report, 
she mentioned that mutant version:

[http://www.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning/crypto/NRC.txt]
  "Other corporations are similarly adopting products with data recovery 
  capabilities as they integrate encryption into their systems (even PGP 
  comes with data recovery in Viacrypt's Business Edition)."

IMHO Phil Zimmerman has good reason to object to the mutant version, if
it's going to cause the PGP name to somehow endorse escrow. 

If there really is a demand for escrow, maybe cypherpunks could create a
One Time Pad escrow service. Different custom 'keys' could be produced,
depending on who's asking for the data... <G>
