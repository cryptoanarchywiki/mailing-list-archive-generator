Using 3DES and SHA does not decrease speed that much (it may even be faster).
Both of them are very secure algorithms.

Why would you want to use straight RSA?  IDEA is as strong as a 3000-bit RSA
modulus.  So far, the only known way to crack IDEA is to brute-force the key
space.  RSA relies on the fact that it is assumed to be difficult to factor
large numbers.  If an efficient way is discovered to factor very large moduli,
then RSA is basically worthless.
