Pathfinder's ever-cheesy Netly News, www.netlynews.com, carried a story June
5th called "InfoWar is Hell" reacting to the Sunday Times cyberterror
report.  http://pathfinder.com/@@V1G2VgUAwN2g0jLY/Netly/daily/960605.html
Pretty good story IMO. 

June 7th story was on the rec.music.white-powder troll. People who actually
bothered to look at news.groups will be pleased to see the laurels heaped on
the votetaker, but displeased that my attempts to get the reporter to POINT
PEOPLE TO NEWS.GROUPS were unsuccessful. URL

If for whatever reason you want the 3MB raw results, I have a copy at
http://www.stanford.edu/~llurch/potw2/rec.music.white-powder that's probably
easier to get to than ftp.uu.net.
