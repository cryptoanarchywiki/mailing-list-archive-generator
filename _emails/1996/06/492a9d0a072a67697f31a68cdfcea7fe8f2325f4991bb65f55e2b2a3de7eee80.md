	Think about catching a ball. Think about writing a program
convince a piece of hardware to catch a ball. Which is _more complex_
neither. Which is harder? writing the program.  

	Back to your example: moving a pencil up and down is not nearly as
complex as "moving" a document through "cyberspace". Then again moving a
pencil up and down isn't nearly as comlex as moving a pencil from Finland
to Miami. 

	Thing is, in the physcial world there is much complexity to what
we accomplish, it is just that we have already learned that complexity. It
is often less of a pain for me to ftp a file from a site half way around
the world that to dig thru the piles of paper to find the print out.
