Sure, but Dr. Phill Hallam-Baker, D.Phil., was contending that
Friedman said the free market solution was for people to voluntarily
stop buying whale meat -- he wasn't even contending that Friedman said
the whales should be owned. Dr. Phill Hallam-Baker, D.Phil., presented
a portrait of Friedman that is so totally out of line with even the
most fuzzy headed free market types that it is almost impossible to
believe that he said anything of the sort.
