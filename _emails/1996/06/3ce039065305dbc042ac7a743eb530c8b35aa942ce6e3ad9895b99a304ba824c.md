June 27, 1996

WASHINGTON, DC -- With no fanfare and no hype, the Justice Department
yesterday faxed a 39-word statement to Senator Exon saying they will
appeal their loss in the Philadelphia case.

The consolidated lawsuits of ACLU v. Reno and ALA v. DoJ resulted in a
victory for the plaintiffs earlier this month after a three-judge panel
granted a preliminary injunction preventing the DoJ from enforcing the
Communications Decency Act.

I didn't know about this letter until about 15 minutes ago, when Bruce "I
wrote the CDA" Taylor showed up outside my office for a HotWired Club
Wired chat at 9 pm this evening.

Taylor was grinning. "I got a scoop for you guys. You owe me. Nobody but
Senator Exon would have gotten this letter out of the department."

For a while, netizens were worrying that the DoJ might appeal the New
York American Reporter v. Reno case, a narrower and weaker appeal that
only challenged part of the CDA.

This letter means that the ACLU/ALA case is definitely going to the
Supremes, which will likely result in a decision a year from now.

Stay tuned for more reports, and check in at Club Wired for the Taylor
transcript. He says it'll be a "roast." We'll see...

June 26, 1996

The Honorable J. James Exon
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator Exon:

With regard to your request as to the status of the appeal on ACLU v.
Reno, this letter is to inform you that the Department of Justice will
file a Notice of Appeal on or before the July 2 deadline.

Sincerely

[signed]

Jamie S. Gorelick
Deputy Attorney General
