I apologize in advance for this overly long post, but Stephan had a number
of arguments that I disagree with quite strongly.  In general, I think
micropayments are a good idea that should be tested where it counts, in the
marketplace.

How is this an argument against micropayments?  Lets just throw up our
hands and say that all crypto is theoretically breakable, therefore we
won't encrypt anything.

Why is this malarkey?  What is wrong with saying "If you want to see my
page, it will cost you $.02?  Why would a "front door" make it any safer
for consumers?  I set my browser so that I spend no more than $1/hour or
$.02 on any one page without asking me.  How difficult is this concept?

Of course, there is lots of software that I only use once in a while, yet
spend large $$ on to have sitting on my machine metaphorically gathering
dust.  Micropayments would be very useful for this software.  On the other
hand, there is some software that I may want to buy outright.  This is not
an exclusive system.  BTW, any impression that you have that you are
currently buying unmetered software is false.  Don't you spend xx$/year to
run Photoshop in the form of "product upgrades" - or are you still running
version 1.0?

I tend to disagree with most arguments for "consumer protection", so this
argument falls upon deaf ears.  There are lots of scams with every form of
money (cash, credit, even barter - if I trade you a lawnmower that only
runs for an hour afterwards, I have scammed you), how does this make
micropayments any more undesirable than any other form of payment?

Name some software that you have used less than 10 times in the past year. 
If you use a computer much, you might be surprised to find that you have a
long list.  I know I do.

What is to say that micropayments won't authorize an extended license for
software you have on YOUR machine - i.e. I download some software, to use
it for a day I pay $1 and get a 1-day license.  The software is local.  Of
course, this doesn't preclude you from paying $1 to run it on a
supercomputer that you wouldn't normally have access to ...

Why would you be shafted?  Do you think vendors would be willing to throw
away your business?  Look at your previous example of the ISPs, some
individuals pay a metered rate, others a flat rate - why would software use
be any different?

Of course, now you can get credit cards thay pay you between 1% and 3% per
transaction ...

Why should people think about this?  Let the market decide - if people try
it and fail, it will go away.  If it suceeds, then it is obviously useful
to some consumers.

Well, the market works.  Sorry you don't believe in reality.

Those poor consumers, what would they do without you looking out for them? 
I personally could care less if someone gets scammed - let the buyer
beware.

If the fees are too large, NO ONE WILL BUY THEM!  Basic economics.

Do you really think people don't know the difference between $.02/minute
and $.02/nanosecond?  Do you think software cannot easily distinguish the
difference?  Let's argue from a basis in reality here!
