A quote from Donald Wetzel's book Pacifist:

The pacifist is often asked what he would do in the event the United
States were to be conquered by a hostile power.  The assumption on the
part of the questioner is almost always that we would simply assume
the proper position in which best to have our asses kicked.  I suggest
that anyone who believes that such would be the pacifist response to
the imposition in America of an oppressive, authoritarian
rule--foreign or domestic--should consult the prison authorities that
were in power when America's prisons were host to some six thousand
pacifists.  I am sure it will be found that we have not been
forgotten.
