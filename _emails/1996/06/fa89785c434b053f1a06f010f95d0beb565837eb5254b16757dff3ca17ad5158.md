o MITI (Japanese Government's Ministry of International
Trade and Industry) began to develop electronic notary
system with some biggest computer company in Japan;
Hitachi, Nihon I.B.M., NEC and Fujitsu.  Some Japanese
bigger bank (such as Daiichi-Kangyo Bank) will also take
part in it.

o It seems to me (by reading this article) that MITI want
to develop Japan-original technology for the electronic
notary system.

o Milestone of the plan:

 - Misc. preparations for it until the end of 1996.
 - Doing experimental examination in 1997.

# I don't know that 1996/1997 are fiscal year (called
# "(kaikei-)nendo" in Japan) or not.  Japanese fiscal year
# starts April in every year.

o This system will be applied for following term:

 1) submitting of public docments to public offices,
 2) electronic commerce,
 3) electronic publishing,
 4) electronic warehouse service.

o IC card will be used in order to store digital key
information.
