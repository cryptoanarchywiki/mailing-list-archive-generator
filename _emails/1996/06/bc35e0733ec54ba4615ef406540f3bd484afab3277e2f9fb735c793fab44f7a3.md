[I AM NOT A LAWYER]

The following contracts are required to be in writing, in most states: 


1. A contract of an executor or administrator to answer
for a duty of the decedent (the executor-administrator
provision).

2. A contract to answer for debt or default of another (the suretyship
provision).

3. A contract made upon consideration of marriage (the marriage provision).

4. A contract for sale of goods worth more than $500 (the sales provision).

5. A contract for sale of an interest in land (the land provision).

6. A contract not preformable within a year (the one-year provision).
