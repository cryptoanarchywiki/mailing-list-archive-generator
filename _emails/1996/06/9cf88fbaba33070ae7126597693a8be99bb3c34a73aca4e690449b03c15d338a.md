I find myself agreeing with nearly all the points about Java that Larry is
making, so something may be wrong....

This can't be the whole story. I'm 44, and Java looks pretty damn exciting
to me, too. Not exciting to stand elbow-to-elbow and be trampled the crowds
at Moscone Center for Java One, but exciting enough to get the Metrowerks
Java compiler for the Mac and half a dozen or so of the Java books (some of
which are even pretty good--I most like "Core Java" and the Gosling book).

I don't have the energy or time to write a Detweiler-length article about
Java (though I think I did a month or so ago), but will say that I think
the security problems are, first of all, no worse vis-a-vis the language
itself than problems with any language.

For me, the main attraction of Java lies  not in the applets, but in the
Net-centric model that makes, in theory (and hopefully in practice) a
Macintosh roughly the equal of a Sun or SGI or Pentium. Until Java and
associated programs and tools appeared, I was seriously thinking about
getting a Pentium or Pentium Pro (shudder, even though I admire my former
employer and current stock benefactor, Intel) and putting Linux on it. Now
I feel more confident that the Mac is a viable competitor in a Net-centric
world. Java may be the Great Equalizer (something Sun may come to regret).

Perry has some valid points vis-a-vis the most naive uses of applets. Were
I the security manager of Morgan Stanley, I would certainly not want
traders downloading "kewl" applets and (possibly) causing Big Problems. So
what else is new?

Java as a language and as a platform-independent implementation is an
achievement. As for Scheme and Smalltalk, both mentioned by Perry, I have
both of these and of course neither has caught on a big way. I won't even
speculate about the many reasons.

And in some ways a more important comparison is to Perl and TCL, along with
more obscure languages like Python and REXX. The welter of Net-oriented
languages shows signs of  being much-simplified by the wide adoption of
Java. It will be interesting to watch the next several years of
developments.
