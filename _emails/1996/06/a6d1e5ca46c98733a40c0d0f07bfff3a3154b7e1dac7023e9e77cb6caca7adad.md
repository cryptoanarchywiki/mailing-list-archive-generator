That was simply to ensure a flame free discussion. Almost anything I talk about
on my local bbs echos (back in India) turns out to be a flame war, specially
if its related to _touchy_ software like PGP :)

in that case if alice receives a key signed by bob, she would know
the key is good. and there is no need for the two other fields. 
infact the reason why i felt pgp is trying to model a reputation system 
if because of these two fields that carry trust values.

this is precisely what i wanted to know. can there be a model wherein one
can compute a trust-like parameter? if yes in what ways should this parameter
be modified and qualified. or conversely what kind of qualification/modification
is required for computing trust?

lets say a reputation system involves alice, bob, carol and don. Computing
trust parameter with respect to each other can lead to situtions where
alice trusts bob x% and has y% proof that he is a liar, after considering 
all other relations. If this x% > y% she'll believe him, if not she won't.
thats why i feel the liar paradox doesn't really pose much of a threat.

There will be inconsistency only if trust/untrust values are absolute.
that is you either trust someone or you don't. i am talking of a system
wherein trust values lie between 0..1 which are derived from a set of
tags. in that case bob alice trusts bob x% bob trusts carol y% and carol
trusts alice z%. if z < x, z < y simply implies alice trusts bob, bob trusts
carol more than carol trusts alice. so the system will be relative rather than
absolute. a person who is trusted by more people will carry greater weight
and people trusted by him will carry higher weight too. this way snoopy
who is not trusted by many people will automatically have a weak relationship
with others.

again these ratings will be decided in a web rather that on one-to-one basis.
that way the social/political pressure can be reduced though not completely
eliminated.

if any research work is freely available i'll be really interested.
