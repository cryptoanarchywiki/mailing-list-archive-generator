I got the following 'junk' email so I bit.  They asked for updated 
descriptions of software that I've thrown on the net, along with 
shareware/freeware/GPL/comm. ratings, etc.  Also violence ratings... 
I set all my source codes to "Gruesome" <insert cheesy emoticon here>

Interesting to see what proggies of mine they listed and what they 
didn't.

Dear Author,

We're building a public database called the "Developer's Directory" which
contains information about authors of shareware/freeware programs.
We'd like to include you and some information about your programs. 

We'd sure appreciate it if you'd visit our website and help
us fill in some info.

  http://pacific.pht.com/  [ my info deleted ;]

Since this system is still in the testing phase, we'd like to hear your
comments and suggestions.  Please send them to:
authors@pht.com

Thank you!

Koji Ashida
