        Just commenting on the niceness of the existence of floppies, I
remember when I got a floppy for the C-64 I was floored. I'd been dumping my
code to audio tape (record it once, change the volume a little, record it
again, change the treble a little, etc. about 3 times to be sure it was on
the tape) for years! Even the c-64's slow drives were FAST in comparison to
sitting by the tape recorder listening for a break in screechy noise to hear
me say "pong 3" or something. <grin> I could store 10 tapes worth of stuff
on a floppy nearly instaneaously, and access it randomly! And once I got the
little cartridge (mach 5) which blanked the screen during floppy access (one
of the major reasons, among other things, the c-64 was so slow) it was like
lightening... <smile>
