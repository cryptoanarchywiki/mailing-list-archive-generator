So wait... if I'm on a Unix box in Georgia and I use the 'su' 
command, am I breaking the law?

It would seem a 'better' law would outlaw the use of false identitity 
when comitting a crime, as is (supposeldy) the case in certain 
discrete carribbean islands...  which begs the question, since a 
crime is a crime, and using a false id to commit a crime is just 
icing on the cake (and doesn't need to be outlawed anyway).

Rob.
