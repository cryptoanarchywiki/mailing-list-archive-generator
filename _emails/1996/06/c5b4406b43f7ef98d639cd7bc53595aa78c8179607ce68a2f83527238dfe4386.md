Nothing (other than the file getting deleted).

They get deleted/edited.

When I was testing some cookie stuff, I regularly deleted several cookies
manually while Netscape was running, with no ugliness resulting. Since
there is no way to delete them from Netscape itself, vi is about the
best option.

   Ken Thompson has an automobile which he helped design.  Unlike most
   automobiles, it has neither speedometer, nor gas gage, nor any of the
   numerous idiot lights which plague the modern driver.  Rather, if the
   driver makes any mistake, a giant "?" lights up in the center of the
   dashboard.  "The experienced driver", he says, "will usually know
   what's wrong."
