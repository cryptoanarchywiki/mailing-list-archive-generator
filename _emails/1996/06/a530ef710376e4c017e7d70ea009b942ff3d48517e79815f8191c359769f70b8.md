I used to work in a major money center bank (late, lamented Irving Trust). I find this
account highly improbable, considering the precautions I've seen used in these
situations.

The only possibility seems to be an inside job, inserting a logic bomb into some
crucial piece of software, and then setting it off either through an inside collaborator,
or by sending an appropriate message through the system from outside: "if you
see a transfer from acct 346769 to 56789 of $3,141,592.65, shut down for an
hour".

Inserting a bomb like this would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible, at IT.
Code modifications were always checked by more than one programmer, and an
extensive 'backout' mechanism existed which permitted us to go back to older versions
of the software in a matter of minutes.

Cracking the system from outside is also unlikely - the operational machines had
no internet connection, dial in, or connection to our development or administrative
lans, nor did they run any of the usual demons 
through which attacks are made. They were connected only to other parts of the
operational system. Even the developers did not have direct access to them - 
putting on new software involved writing it to a removable HD which was then 
physically transfered to the operational systems. Only the operators were permitted
to touch the consoles of the operational systems.

Finally, we maintained a 'hot site' duplicating most of our capability, at a location
about 100 miles away, in case of catastrophe. Switching to that would have taken
a few hours, but was certainly doable.

I also find the claim improbable - the Swiss authorities are quite cooperative when
there is good reason to beleive a crime is being committed.

If it's an inside job, then it's not much of a threat, since each financial institution
would need to be penetrated separately. 

The only way in which this might NOT be an inside job would be if a logic bomb
was inserted into some piece of commercial software used by all of the targets,
such as a message database. If so, then there is no reason not to identify the
package.

Until names get named, I'm going to view this story with extreme skepticism.


Finally, people may wish to look at the source of the posting. Mr Schwartau
is a consultant who makes his living by advising institutions on how to protect
themselves against attacks of the type claimed in this story.
