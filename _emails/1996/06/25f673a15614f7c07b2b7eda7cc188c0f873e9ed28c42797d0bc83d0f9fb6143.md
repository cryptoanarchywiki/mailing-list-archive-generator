To heck with trojans... how does it know what version of NiftyMail 
you are using?  So what if you make up a dummy directory and dummy 
files with proper CRCs for NiftyMail v2.0, so Oil Change upgrades you 
to a real version of NiftyMail v2.1.  Gives a whole new avenue for 
software piracy here...

...Or does it keep a central database of registered NiftyMail users?
Does it pass along things like serial numbers embedded in software?

And is info on who owns what software kept private? Or will you be 
spammed/junk-mailed direct marketing info?

Yes. Many questions.
