Hm.

The more I think about it, the more that it seems foolish to be 
against anonymous payee systems.  Mainly because those who want it 
now (and who will want it in the future) and who have the resources 
will already have it.

As for catching tax-evaders, criminals, etc... for most the five 
BMWs, indoor heated pool and yacht should be enough attention for 
those who really want to know.  Of course the gov't isn't that 
interested in doing the legwork... better for them to have everything 
on a computer for easy data-crunching rather than do real footwork. 
(Can you say downsizing? Nah.... they'd put twice the savings into 
useless gadgets like attack helicopters to patrol minority 
neighborhoods with...)

Off the track, slightly:

It seems the effect that these laws have are to make it so only the 
very wealthy and connected (or perhaps incredibly ambitious and 
smart) have access to privacy and de facto loopholes in the law.
The only "criminals" who will be able to get away with anything are 
those who are already so well off (and possibly buddy-buddy with the 
Powers That Bee, Bzzt!).

Good point. But many consumers want anonymity, or at least to control 
what information they give customers.  Many might even settle for 
pseudo-anonymity (ie, account number 123456 likes to buy product X, 
but whoever 123456 *is* is known only to 123456....).

Everyone is at some time or another, unless you never eat.
