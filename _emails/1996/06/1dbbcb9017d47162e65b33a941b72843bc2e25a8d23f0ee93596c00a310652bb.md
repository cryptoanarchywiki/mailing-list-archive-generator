Don't even assume that hardware RNGs and OTPs by themselves make a system
unbreakable.  Go see NSA's web site on the Verona intercepts to see what
people who know what they are doing can do when users slip up using a OTP
system.  http://www.nsa.gov:8080/

I'm with Lucky (and many others) 100% on this one.  Snake Oil.
