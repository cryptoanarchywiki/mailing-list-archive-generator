I guess I made myself misunderstood.  I meant to reply to Jim Bell 
mentionning that he would like to see some peoples interested in 
discussing the implementation of AP.  It is very different than just 
talking about (against) govt.

No. No offense meant, but you are wrong here. Did you read
Assasination Politics?  By the nature of it, govt employees will get
killed and *this* warrant trying to kill everybody they would
suspect of setting up an AP server.

No offense, but please, re-read the paragraph.  That is exactly what 
I meant...

Did you read the AP essay?  I don't think so otherwise you wouldn't 
have commented in that sense.  What you say is true but IMO, AP is 
absolutely different from The Economist.  Remember, it entails 
asassination of govt employees...

I did not say "subscription", but "cumulative subscription".  I think 
that C'Punks is having around 1500 subscribers theses days.
