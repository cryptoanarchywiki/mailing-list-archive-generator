The people, that's who.  The reason is that while "corrupt officials" may 
have more money, per person, that ordinary citizens, there are FAR more 
ordinary citizens than officials.  Further, these corrupt officials only 
have more money because they rob it from ordinary citizens, which means that 
they start out the game hated by the public.

Finally, officials are, by definition, identified or identifiable, while 
disaffected citizens are not.
