Hello all

I'm a law student at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. During the last
months I've been
working on an paper about legal aspects of electronic cash, in which
DigiCash's ecash is one
of the two main models I examined. The main part of the paper consists of a
thesis on the
qualification of ecash as an analogy to bank cheques or private banknotes
based on digital
documents. The paper contains a large list (40 items) of further
literature, too.

This paper is now available via Internet at the following Address:
http://www.inf.ethz.ch/department/IS/ea/iur/1996/Arbeiten.html with a link
to the file
ftp://ftp.inf.ethz.ch/pub/org/ti/ga/Patru/legal/1996/schlauri.ar.ps

(PostScript, 36 pages, about 370K. The paper is written in German.)

I'm looking forward to your comments.

Regards

Simon Schlauri
