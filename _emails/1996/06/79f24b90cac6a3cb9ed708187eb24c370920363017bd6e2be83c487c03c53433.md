F-secure is a new commercial version of the SSH package, written by Tatu
Ylonen from Finland. It uses the SSH protocol v2.0 and it is developed and
sold by Data Fellows from Finland, http://www.datafellows.com/
Cryptographic algorithms are RSA, IDEA and 3-key 3DES. It can be sold both
inside and outside the US. I would say the SSH package is very secure and
very well designed.
