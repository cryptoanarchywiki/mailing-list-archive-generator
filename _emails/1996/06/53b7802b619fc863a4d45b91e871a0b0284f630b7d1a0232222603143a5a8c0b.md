	as to the politiks --if we do not standup now, we will not even be able  
to speak up later.  there is no question that every means of confronting a  
totalitarian driven government apparati must be developed, and the means of  
impletation well known.

	the only safety is in numbers; and, yes, some of the "brethern" will  
fall.  anymore than the aging Chinese despots were able to contain the news of  
Tinnamin square, and I stood at the corner by the Forbidden City as it was  
starting to form, despots everywhere are faced with the same problem.  in  
China, the free speach and democracy protestors faced enormous technological  
and communication deficiencies --so far, we do not.

--
The result of today's 'government' 
  is new world disorder, unfolding at warp velocity.
