Chris, a couple of omissions in your very good techwatch CDA extravaganza
(http://pathfinder.com/technology/netdecency/)

1) the screening software sidebar in this week's TIME (preferably with live
pointers)
2) John Perry Barlow's TIME essay from late 1995 (search TIME for "this
bill is full of shit")

I could argue the omission of the "cyberporn" cover round or flat.
