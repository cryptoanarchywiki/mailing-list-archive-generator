What is wrong with this is that, because RSA did not, in practice deliver
the software to NTT, they can have no expectation of payment.  Thus begins
a trumped up lawsuit in international court, and it will eventually cost
RSA more to collect on the sale than the sale was worth.  As many rock-solid
implementations of the RSA algorithms as are out there, all NTT has to do
is go to an FTP site in the netherlands.  Done deal.  But what about the
copyrights (which are still unclear) and the US patents?  NTT would not be
able to market their system in the US without losing face.

Not gonna happen.
