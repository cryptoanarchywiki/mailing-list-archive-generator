Not only that, but where are the cryptographers of the future going to
come from for the NSA to recruit?  Israel??  Oh right, foreign
nationals privy to our own highest secrets, give me a break.  Do they
intend to train them themselves?  If so, that's identical in principle
to universities granting tenure to their own graduates.  You get
inbred that way, so universities don't do that.

The principle behind crypto secrecy presumes that other people don't
have the secret.  Once they do, you only hurt yourself by trying to
keep a double-edged sword in the closet.  The NSA believes that they
can and should discard any amount of benefits of crypto in exchange
for avoiding any harm of crypto.  They are wrong.
