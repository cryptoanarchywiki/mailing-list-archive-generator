	These thoughts are generic, and I haven't even looked at the
surfgate web page.

	Does it access a file?  winsock?  hard coded memory addresses?
Does it modify itself (Its code sections)?  What system calls does it
make?  Are they all on the thought safe list?

	If it does not, then you have a first level analysis and can
say that it might not be unsafe; you're a *LOT* better off than you
were before.

	Trying to prove the code is safe is hard.  Looking for obvious
attacks (java that writes .rhosts, mails off /etc/passwd) is not very
hard.   It can lead to a false sense of security.
