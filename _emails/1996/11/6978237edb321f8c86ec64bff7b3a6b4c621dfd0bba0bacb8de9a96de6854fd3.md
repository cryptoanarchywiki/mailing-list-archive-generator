Depends on how their telco's tariffs are set up.  Here in Indiana,
we have a monopoly called "Ameritech" who, out of the kindness of 
their hearts, charges ***per-minute*** ISDN rates.  Expect costs 
of over $600/month for a permament connection (one line) to the 
Internet.  Beverly Hills High School *might* be able to afford it.
Most other places can't.  <sigh>

Best Regards,
