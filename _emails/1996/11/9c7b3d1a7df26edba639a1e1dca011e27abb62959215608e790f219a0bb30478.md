Several months ago, someone was raving about getting Linux PCs and 
cheap satellite comms into Hong Kong in preparation for the mainland 
takeover so that the ensuing human rights violations could be 
documented. If there's anyone left on cypherpunks who knows or cares 
about that kind of thing, let me know.
