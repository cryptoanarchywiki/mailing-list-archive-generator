The average welfare benefit (including food stamps, medicaid, and all the
other myriad programs) is $10/hr.  Compare to a minimum wage of $5/hr.
Offer most welfare recipients a minimum wage job and they will laugh in your
face.  (In fact, here in Michigan most employers are already paying several
$$ above minimum wage, and often these jobs are unfilled).

I don't claim to know the motives.  I am examining empirical evidence.  As
the welfare benefit increases, more go on welfare, as it decreases, less go
on welfare.  Someone is making economic decisions, consciously or
unconsciously.
