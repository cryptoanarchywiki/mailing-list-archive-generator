Don, can you give us this proof please? I mean really complete proof, 
not vague references to other people's theorems and metadiscussions. 

I do agree with you that your opponents freuquently attack you without
actually proving what they say. This is unfortunate. I do hope that you, 
though, can be above your detractors able to produce real proofs without
resorting to namecalling and character assassination.

I.e., your bashing of Paul Bradley, for example, may or may not
concvince me that Paul does not understand cryptography. It will NOT
convince me, though, that IPG system is good. I am not interested in
your attacks on persons, however right you may be. Rather, it is
important that you give us a good proof of security of IPG system.

Thanks

	- Igor.
