hi --

i'm having a discussion with some people, trying to persuade them to set up
an anonymous remailer on an italian server.

i need a few technical data about how much computing resources does a
remailer take, how much ram, cpu time, average traffic and so.

since i can't deal with the huge (though interesting) traffic carried by
this list, i'm not going to subscribe. so please if you can help, contact me
privately at my address.

i feel that if i succeed, a new remailer would be of some help for the
entire cypherpunk community worldwide.

thanks.
