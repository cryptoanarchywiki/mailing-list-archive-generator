Actually, Coppolino mentioned the CDA in the Bernstaein hearing.  I haven't
gone through the transcript, but the gist of his point was that, while the
Judges in Philly had found that the CDA was prior restraint, ITAR was not
(or something similar).

I did not find his arguments very persuasive -- he seemed stuck on the idea
that crypto is not speech, when that had already been ruled against by
Judge Patel.

He may have been trying to make the record clear, for possible appeal.
