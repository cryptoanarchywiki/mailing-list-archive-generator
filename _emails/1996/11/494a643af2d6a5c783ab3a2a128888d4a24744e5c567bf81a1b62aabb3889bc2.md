Declan's done an excellent journalistic job. I understand that because of the
space limitations he couldn't quote everything that everyone told him, so one
small point in his article might be misinterpreted by a casual reader:

Why "almost"? :-)

There's no such thing as "former" KOTM, Declan. That's a lifetime achievement!

I told Declan that agree 100% - John Gilmore has the right to do anything
he likes with his private mailing list. The 1st Amendment does not apply.

However censorship needn't be government-imposed.

If John Gilmore ascribes this opinion to me, then he's lying outright.
