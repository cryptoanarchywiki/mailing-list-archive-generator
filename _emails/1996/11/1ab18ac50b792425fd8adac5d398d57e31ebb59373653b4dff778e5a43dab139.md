Dear Friend,

The Only Internet Book you will ever Need....

So you're on the Internet, but don't know what to do,
where to go, or how to do it. This EXCITING 175 page,
14 chapter, E-Book will cover everything from the
World Wide Web, Veronica, IRC Clients, Gopher, Telnet,
Advanced Email, and how to set up your own electronic
store front.  Whether you're a veteran on the net or
have just begun, there is something to LEARN from
"Your Personal Guide to the Internet". The Internet is
growing daily and it is quickly becoming the wave of
the future.

Have you ever wondered what people are talking about
when they mention FTP or client-server protocol? Has
it made you feel left out when you didn't understand
their lingo? Everyone knows that KNOWLEDGE is POWER,
so why not learn more and take advantage of it?
Picture this.  You buy a beautiful boat, and you go
to take it out on the lake.  You get there, you can
start the boat, but can't get it to go anywhere.  That
is how many people are on the Internet.  They have the
software and the ability to go online, but don't know
what to do with it.  This is where "Your Personal Guide
to the Internet" comes in.  Just as a boat manual  would
have been useful to allow you to go on your trip, this
guide will allow you to do just about ANYTHING that you
can imagine on the Internet.

So, how much will this knowledge cost you? Simply, $4.00!
That's right, FOUR DOLLARS.  Why are we selling it for a such
a LOW PRICE?  We feel that everyone who is online should
be able to use the Internet to their full capabilities.
Why go to the bookstore and spend $50 to $100 on Internet
books, when you can get everything you need for $4.00?
This is a MUST HAVE!  Do not pass up this
OPPORTUNITY!  This is a LIMITED OFFER.
