   11-15-96. WaJo:

   "History of Software Begins With the Work Of Some Brainy
   Women"

      The Army called the women "computers." One day word
      spread that the brightest "computers" were needed to
      work on a new machine called the Eniac, setting dozens
      of dials and plugging a ganglia of heavy black cables
      into the face of the machine, a different configuration
      for every problem -- "programming," they came to call
      it. "The Eniac," says one woman, now 71, "was a son of
      a bitch to program."
