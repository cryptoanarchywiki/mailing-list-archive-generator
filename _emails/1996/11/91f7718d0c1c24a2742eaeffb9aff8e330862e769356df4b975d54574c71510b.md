PALO ALTO, Calif. (Reuter) - Hewlett-Packard Co. said Friday that it will
unveil a breakthrough agreement on Monday in the long-deadlocked debate
over software encryption, a development that could eliminate a key
impediment to the growth of electronic commerce via the Internet.

A spokesman said H-P Chairman and Chief Executive Lewis Platt will provide
details of a deal involving computer industry leaders, the Clinton
administation and other governments at a press conference in Washington.
