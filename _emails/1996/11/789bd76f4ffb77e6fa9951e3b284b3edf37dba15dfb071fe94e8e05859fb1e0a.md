Exactly. Because the list takes in submissions from ALL parties and then
resubmits them to ALL SUBSCRIBED parties it qualifies as a publisher. 

The real issue here is that folks on the net want the protection of the 1st
Amendment but they don't want the responsibility that goes along with it.
This list qualifies as a press. As a result it has a responsibility relating
to what it distributes.

Vulis was unpopular he was not distruptive. At NO time did he interfere with
the normal operation of the list software or prevent submissions or
remailings.

We need fewer lawyers and better laws. Most pseudo-law is practiced by lawyers.
