I say you're wrong. Vulis has been denied nothing but the dignity of 
reading the list under his own name. He still has freedom to read under 
a pseudonym, and he still has freedom to post under his own name, or any 
other.

Such as by notifying the list that exactly one particularly obnoxious 
member has been kicked off, and allowing *unlimited* discussion on the 
list about the impact of doing so? I think this is working.
