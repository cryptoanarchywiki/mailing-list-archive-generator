Strange love, huh?  For the record, I replied to your previous hate mail
privately to avoid putting totally useless stuff on the list, but since
you insist on pressing the (useless) point, Mr./Ms. Censor-happy asshole,
I'll say it publicly (assuming *they* allow it):  Take a hike, a long walk
off a short pier, etc.  Nobody really cares about you or what you think,
probably not even your mother.  This is not a love forum, it's a forum
by and for ego-maniacal paranoids who don't really love anyone but them-
selves, or maybe a really close friend (likely no more than one) just
enough to not kick them out onto the street.

BTW, I'm not saying that ego-maniacal paranoids are necessarily a bad
thing, particularly in a world full of rednecks (their counterpart, but
with less brainpower), just that they need to be reminded now and then
that they are *not* in fact gods or godoids or whatever.

BTW-2, you're probably still smarting from when I told you that your
precious PGP et al is basically 1940's technology attempting to run on
processors that should be relegated to pocket PDA's.  You really should
grow up and work on something that can use the brain cells you have left.
