That's 50 CENTS per megabyte, but actually it is twice less than that.

My calculation (storage costs only, assume 10kb/sec/person):

6000KB * 0.25c/MB * 2.5E8 = 375 million.

Good money, but not even close to your number.

Also, storing data on optical disks is about $20/600MB, which is only
three cents per megabyte -- ten times less than above.

Even though this is storage media cost alone, 37.5 million surely 
sounds like a reasonable number -- it is 15 cents per person, or
90 cents per hour, or $22.6 per day per person. A little steep, but after
several years this cost may decline tenfold.

Of course my rough calculation missed a lot of important expenses.
