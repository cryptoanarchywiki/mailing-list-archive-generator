We are in agreement.  I would add, for the benefit of others, that it
is a good idea to keep in mind that the focus of our work is to build
physical systems which are secure.  For instance, we determine the
primality of numbers using probabilistic methods.  This is not
"perfect" in the sense that a OTP is, but it is certainly good enough
to bet somebody else's life on it.  ;-)

OTPs, for that matter, are engineering problems, too.  It is difficult
to find a random number generator in which we have complete
confidence.  If we buy a board from somebody, how do we know there
isn't a back door?  How do we know they did a good job?  Many
commercially available hardware random number generators are of
shockingly poor quality.  Caveat emptor.
