One of the subheadings in the white paper: "Toward a New Commercial
Order."  Ya gotta love it.

A lot of the security (that is, "security" from the point of view of
nervous Federales) seems to rely on certificates and tokens that are
supposedly spoof-proof (I guess).  Looks to me as if application 
certificates will be rather difficult to protect from being "abused".
It's also not clear to me how they'd prevent my flying to Luxembourg,
getting a Policy token that allows any & all crypto functions, and
then flying my butt back to Singapore for an encryption party.
