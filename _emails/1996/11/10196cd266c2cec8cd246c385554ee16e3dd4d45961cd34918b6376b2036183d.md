The technical term is "homosexual panic".  It refers to people who have 
grown up being constantly told that they should hate homosexuals, yet
are constantly waking up at 3am from a dream in which they were taking
a nine inch cock up their ass and loving it.

It's related to the fact that most rapists are actually terrified of
women.

As always, consider the source.

           TIME is happening.  IS there a word?
Sandman:   CHANGE.
Delirium:  Oh.  I was AFRAID of that.
