Hi, 

I am physically located in India and want to start up a  US firm that will operate in India. Basically 
the firm will be a multonational with regional offices in couple of countries, to start with India 
and prolly one somewhere in Europe sometime later. The business involves a tie up with another US firm. 
These people will obviosly require USD payements, while most of the money we'll make will be in Indian 
rupees, since initially we'll be _actually_ operating only in India. 

The problems here are :

x. Can I, an Indian citizen start a US firm? 
x. Is it _legal_ to transfer Rupees funds to our root US firm and buy dollars with it to 
   pay our partners there?
x. Who will sell us USDs? Foreign Exchange offices? Firms like Accu-Rate?
x. What is the tax situation in US for non-citizens?
x. Is US the best place to start such a firm, primary need is to be able to pay dollars to US partner,
   while earning in rupees, without any legal hassles.   

Any help will be appreiciated,

Best,
Vipul
