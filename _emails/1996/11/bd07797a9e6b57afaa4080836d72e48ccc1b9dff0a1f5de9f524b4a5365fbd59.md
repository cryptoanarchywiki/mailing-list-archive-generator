Judge Patel has decided that she already knows enough, based on the
papers submitted by both sides, to decide our motion for a preliminary
injunction to protect Dan Bernstein as he teaches a class on
cryptography in January.

She also says that she will decide our motion for partial summary
judgement (from the September 20th hearing) at the same time.

So, THERE WILL BE NO HEARING ON NOVEMBER 8TH!  DON'T COME, WE WON'T BE THERE.

Apologies for the short notice.  It's all the notice the legal team
got.

I'll let you know as soon as she releases her decision.

	John Gilmore
