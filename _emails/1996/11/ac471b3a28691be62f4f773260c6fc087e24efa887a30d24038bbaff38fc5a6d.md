Suppose Bob lives in an apartment complex. By accident the whole building
burns down. 

Bob manages to escape, but all his papers, including passport, IDs,
credit cards, acount numbers, etc etc gets destroyed.

What can Bob do? Would the government help him?

It seems like he'd be in a really unfavorable position...
