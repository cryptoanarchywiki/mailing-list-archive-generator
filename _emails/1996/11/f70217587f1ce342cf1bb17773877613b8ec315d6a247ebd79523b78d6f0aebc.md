It is true of computers.
Take the case of Ripco (the Chicago BBS raided in the SunDevil raids back
when).

I don't think "Dr. Ripco" has yet gotten his equipment back.  I don't know
for sure, but what I do know is that 5 years after the raid, he still had
certainly not gotten anything back.  Keep in mind that the feds took
everything which even looked computer-like in his rather substantial
workshop, including telephones, VCR equipment, burners, the works.

Recall also that Ripco was never specifically charged (or the minor
charges that they did try to pin didn't stick).

Also recall that Ripco (now ripco.com) was raided with a -sealed- warrant.
I dont think that the contents of that warrant have, even today, been
released (though I could be mistaken).  Certainly 5 years after they had
not.

I'd argue with computer hardware it is a distinction without a difference.
Seizing computer hardware (like Ripco's stuff) for in excess of 5 years is
tantamount to forfeiture given depreciation and so forth.

Add to this the very liberal rules about how long the feds can take to
even CHARGE you with a crime after seizure....

RICO has the same problems, and also in the context of innocent 3rd
parties.  Innocent owner protection is mostly in the form of definition.
Specifically what is an "instrumentality of the crime" and what is a
"passive object" which just happened to be involved.  The real weakness is
that this is generally a question of law and tends to end up in the hands
of judges, not juries, to decide.  It has factual elements, to be sure,
but not enough in the current construct to make me feel secure that a jury
is really the only gateway to finding something an "instrumentality."

Again, I would argue that such a statute needn't even exist given the
rules already well estlablished and demonstrated in action with regard to
indefinate seizure of computer hardware even in the absence of criminal
claims against the owner.

Also, take note that many states are adopting unique civil forfeiture
approaches.  Research into the federal system, while generally giving one
the flavor, cannot give you the full picture.  (Michigan and Indiana are
mavericks here).

Strictly speaking, he may be correct, however, I doubt very much that a
judge would ignore a motion for a temporary restraining order pleading
that the server in question is the primary income stream for the (ISP,
marketing company, bank, etc.).

Also note carefully the distinction between "instrumentality of the crime"
and "passive participating element" in the crime.  Now if the hacker was
co-owner of the server....

Again, I think the question of forfeiture somewhat meaningless in that
the server could be taken as evidence and not be returned until it's value
is <1/50th of the purchase price regardless of the complicity of the
owner.
