Do not declare your children as dependants.  If you do then you are required
to get a SSN for them, but if you are willing to waive the tax savings there
is no requirement than children have a SSN.  Not having a handy universal
index number like a SSN makes it a lot harder for people to accumulate
statistics on your kids.
