Notes on network computers, blind copies, democratic culture, monopolies,
and the idea of an Internet establishment...


As a periodic reminder, a Web archive of nearly all the RRE messages ever
sent can be found through  http://communication.ucsd.edu/pagre/rre.html


It turns out that the article on cryptography by Bruce Schneier that I
forwarded from the Risks Digest the other day was actually an unfinished
draft that Peter Neumann sent out by mistake.  Bruce asks that everyone
refrain from propagating that version around the net.
