One the same note, I must say that implimentation of OTP perfectly is
impossible; you can _never_ prove you have truly random numbers.  The
point is that if the numbers are reasonably independant of each other (i
know -- sortof a contradiction) then they are, as you said, good enough.

The real problem with OTP is still key exchange ;)
