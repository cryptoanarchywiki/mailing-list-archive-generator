Actually, the current impelmentation of ecash only offers _payer_ anonynmity  
and not payee anonymity.  If the payer reveals the blinding factors and/or  
coin numbers to the bank then the payee is caught when attempting to deposit.   
This on purpose, to prevent scenarios such as the kidnapping one from  
actually happening.  The solution, of course, is for the payee to generate and  
blind the coins and order the payer to have them signed.  Money changers are  
another option, but require you to trust them.
