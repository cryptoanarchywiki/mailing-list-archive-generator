There is a very distinct difference between ejecting disruptive influences
and conducting one's self as a publisher and distributer.

Though these are issues which will end up before a jury (should it ever
get that far) the fact that the list owner might have booted off a
disruptive entity after repeated warnings is hardly going to meet the
threshold to throw Mr. Gilmore into the catagory of "publisher."
