PGP Inc. (http://www.pgp.com/) is now marketing Viacrypt PGP.
 There are two packages, Viacrypt PGP Personal Edition which is PGP, like we 
all know and love. PE also is available as DOS, MS-Windows, Mac, and UNIX. So 
Viacrypt PGP/PE for DOS should feel similar if not identical to MIT's PGP, 
though I haven't tested it yet.
 You could license IDEA single-license and license RSAREF for commerical 
usage (http://www.consensus.com/ or JonathanZ@consensus.com), but why 
bother?
 They also have a Business Edition which supports key escrowing, not some 
US government backdoor, but a 'master key' for businesses to recover 
encrypted information if an employee forgets a passphase (which they do), 
dies (which they do, if the information is very important), is on 
vacation (sometimes it happens), etc.
 In a commerical environment, key escrowing is for data recovery, not for 
spying on employees. If you want to use your employer's email system for 
your personal email, then use a personal public key.
