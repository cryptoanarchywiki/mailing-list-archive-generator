The problem is that Ladbroke won't take your offer, they don't
work that way. If they wanted to insure against a Dole victory
they would place some of the money they got from betters on Dole
at William Hill, at 10:1, instead of taking your offer at 6:1.
But probably they get too few bets on Dole to bother with insurance;
they do take risks. Another way of insuring themselves would have
been to offer 11/10 or something on Clinton but obviously they
don't feel they have to do that.
