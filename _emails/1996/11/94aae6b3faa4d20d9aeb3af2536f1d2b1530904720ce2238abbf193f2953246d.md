Along with one proviso: "In everyday use"
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clearly, to them, the IRA (or possibly the local hash dealer) is not an
"everyday use" situation.

The value of provisos like this, to companies and politicians, is hard
to understate. Bill Clinton really meant to "End welfare as we know it."
                                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Voters saw the statement, ignored the proviso, and liked it; hardly any
of them imagining that his proviso could include plans for a drastic
_increase_ in the size and scope of the U.S. welfare state.
