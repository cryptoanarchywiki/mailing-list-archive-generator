Nope. This RFC is merely a rehash of the pgformat.doc file in the PGP
2.6.? distribution. I'm doing an independent implementation of the PGP
2.6 message formats, and found this document unclear in a few spots. For
example, can anyone else figure out the weird CFB variant mode from this
document? I used a debugger on the PGP code to help me figure it out.

The PGP 3.0 "spec" that you're referring to is actually a draft for a
PGP library API. A couple of those got circulated on some PGP mailing
lists, but none have been publicly released, another example of the
secrecy surrounding the whole PGP effort.

Now that PGP Inc. is happening, it's not exactly clear whether the PGP
3.0 release is going to include an API closely resembling these drafts.

Hope this helps.

Raph
