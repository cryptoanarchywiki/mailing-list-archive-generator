Why would you want it?

The PKZ 3.0 trojan is at least 5 years old.  (I am amazed I can still read
the disk my copy is on without the magnetic media flaking off.)  It is a
pretty pathetic trojan at that...

And no, I am not going to send you a copy.  You would use it not for good,
but for evil.  (And not the fun sort of evil either.  That required things
and devices you are far to young to know about...  As well as black leather
clad women with <ahem> ...  Sorry...)

I suggest that you put your inquisitive nature into researching something
that will do you some good.  (Or at least, get you out of the house.)
