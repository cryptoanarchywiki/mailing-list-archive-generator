It makes no difference whatsoever, no PRNG can have more entropy in 
the output stream than there was in the initial seed. Indeed, in 
general, the longer the PRNG runs for the more chance an adversary 
has of breaking it due to an increased amount of output.

Well for a start it`s not a one time pad because that requires a 
totally real random pad. They have a stream cipher, as for whether it 
is any good or not I would normally not trust a man with the talent 
for bullshit Don Wood has.
