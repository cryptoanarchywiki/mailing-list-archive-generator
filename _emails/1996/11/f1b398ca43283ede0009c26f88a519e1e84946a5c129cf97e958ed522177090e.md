	Is PGP trademarked? Are you sure? And if it is, is naming something Very
Good Privacy a violation? Why? Legal people, please help!

	In your quote, you deleted the smiley about VGP. It's a joke. Your claim
that VGP is weaker than PGP is unfounded, as VGP uses IDEA, which is the
symmetric algorithm used in PGP. ASCII and Vigenere are very weak, but they
are fast and geared toward people who simply want to stop their brother or
sister from getting into something. As for the security of other
algorithms, BlowFish is used in PGPfone and RC4 is used in SSL -- since you
control the key size in VGP, you can make RC4 virtually unbreakable (not to
mention the problem of the attacker figuring out the key size in the first
place).
