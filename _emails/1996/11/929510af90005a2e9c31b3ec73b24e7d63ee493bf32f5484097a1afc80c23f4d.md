What a wonderfully self-referential statement. That's exactly what
this statement does for you...

If people have difficulty ignoring those on a mailing list or
newsgroup that they do not like, how can you expect them to know about
this herculean feat of responsibility?

Call it what you will. In my eyes, here is someone who is attempting
(ineffectually, which is perhaps deliberate) to stop messages from
being sent to another human which used to be sent to that other human.

Censorship? Ownership? Why does ownership justify dishonor?

But he is an official of the list. Censorship is not just practiced by
governments...

Resistance to lack of editorial control prevents one from seeing
the true nature of ideologies and opinions. Maybe you don't want this,
but why deny it to others? Still...

If that is what you wish to call yourself. I maintain no such position.

Freedom is anything but categorizable in the terms you are using.
