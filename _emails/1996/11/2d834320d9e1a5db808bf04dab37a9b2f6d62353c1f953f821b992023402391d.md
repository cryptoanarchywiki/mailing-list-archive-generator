If the keyboard-entropy program you're using hashes in the values
of the keys typed as well as the timing, this can let you improve the
actual entropy of the data you enter.  Get yourself a deck of cards
or some 20-sided D&D dice or toss some yarrow stalks or open a book randomly,
and type in those values rather than the fjfjfjfjfj stuff you
might otherwise use.  Won't hurt, and it'll let you be sure you've
got all the entropy you need*
