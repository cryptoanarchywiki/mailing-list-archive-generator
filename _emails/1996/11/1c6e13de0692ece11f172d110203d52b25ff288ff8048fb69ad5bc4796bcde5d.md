I won't argue with your figures, I don't believe them but lets use them
for arguments sake. UI (or is it EI now?) + welfare increase the
unemployment rate by a combined 3%, that still leaves (at least) 7+%
unemployed, a significant number! Meanwhile, major corporations who are
significantly adding to the unemployment rate themselves (heard of
`downsizing') are making record profits. That too must be the poor
people's fault, yes?

You have a right to be angry about CPP, it pisses me too for I know I
won't get a dime either. But the people you *should* be mad at are the
seniors and politians who allowed this to happen, not the people on the
low end.

FWIW, I agree with you about the Unions (for the most part). Many have
lost sight of the reasons they were formed in the first place. The
leaders of those unions, at least the biggies, have become the monster
they so love to hate. The recent Canadian Airline fiasco is a prime
example.

Last I heard, the CAW was still refusing to allow a vote. I would love
to see that union broken myself.

Who has also been implicated in some form of insider trading, not the
white knight everyone would have us believe.

I assume you mean: "Sorry for NOT citing my sources"

cheers, kinch

PS: I am not going to keep this up, at least not on cypherpunks, it has
zip to do with the charter.
