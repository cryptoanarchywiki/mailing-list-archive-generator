Please eschew the obfuscation.  The sentences Phill hastely wrote
are simply contradictory.  It's fatuous to claim, after the fact,
that he intended some sort of dialectic (i.e., a system of 
arguement in which conflicting ideas are resolved).

Intellectual honesty isn't required on this list, but it is
appreciated.
