My first comment on the subject:  It's only irreversible if certain conditions hold.

First, if the masses become dependent on a large software program which has to be
updated occasionally by its corporate sponsors, somewhat like the voting software
which is controlled by those who benefit from said control (not the masses), then
those who "compile their own" would tend to stand out and be more noticeable.

Second, any truly secret messaging taking place represents a serious threat to the
military, and contrary to some naive popular opinion, those guys are not going to
lay down for this, unless it happens on an immense scale, i.e., the *majority* of
citizens are doing the "truly secret" messaging, which is not likely if paragraph
#1 above holds.
