Then there is the meat-packing inspectors, I don't know if this should give
piece of mind or instill new fear.  The inspectors were put in there because
the meat was rancid, the thing is, some of it still is if you listen to the
critics.
A partial fix at least.

Another point is, if the government attacks Netscape for their strong
crypto(which is pretty hard to get, I'm in Oklahoma and I couldn't get it
because some server didn't know for sure that my server was in the United
States or Canada), someone will probabally make an in-line plug-in for
encrypted data, and this plug-in may affect more of the browser than the
existing system, making it more dangerous to the governments schemes.
Anyone know where the data is stored on how to write for Netscape?
