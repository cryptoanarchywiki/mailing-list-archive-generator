If it can't be proven, why do you believe it is true?

The good news is that you can prove a negative.  For example, it has
been proven that there is no algorithm which can tell in all cases
whether an algorithm will stop.

The best they can say is what they did say: they have a proof that
their system is unbreakable.  What you question, quite reasonably,
is whether they have such a proof.

Or, more accurately, nobody credible has seen such a proof.  But, a
clever person might invent one.

IPG is eager to demonstrate their proof.  They should hire a professional
skilled in the art to evaluate their proof and publicly announce the
results.  This costs less than $5000 and would be, presumably, a small part
of their profits should they have invented such an algorithm.
