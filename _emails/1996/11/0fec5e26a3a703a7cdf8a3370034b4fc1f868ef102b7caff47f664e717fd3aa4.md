I cannot speak for the GAK advocates.  However, you could establish a
system where messages between two countries are encoded with keys
which are made available to only the two countries in question.

A really simple scheme to do this would be for each country to publish
a public key.  You would be required to encrypt the key to the message
with the national public key.  That scheme would be fast to deploy.

In a more complicated and secure scheme, you would be given a public key
from each country that was unique for your communications at the same
time you were granted your international communications license.  The
unique public key would be managed by a small group of people.  This
means that if it was ever compromised, most message traffic would be
secure and those who were responsible would be easy to find.

The only way you are at the mercy of the Libyans is if you do business
in Libya.
