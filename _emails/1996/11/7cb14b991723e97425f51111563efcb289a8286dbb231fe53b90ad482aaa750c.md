OK, so the authors might have better used the phrase "putatively
tamperproof." Or the more accepted modern phrase, "tamper-resistant."

As with safes, castles, and "bulletproof vests," all claims of absolute
security are dubious.

What the Bellcore and Biham-Shamir (and other, reportedly) attacks have
done is to show another vector by which "tamperproof" is not.

Faults can be induced as well in logic devices. I agree that redundancy can
be added to logic devices (I worked on this for Intel a while back), but
this would require an almost complete re-doing of smartcard processors.
(For starters, imagine implementing triple redundancy in smartcards....not
cheap.)

Again, what these recent attacks show is a theoretical avenue by which
nominally tamper-resistant cards may have their defenses breached. Whether
this is an important threat depends on a bunch of factors. Whether
cardmakers change their chips also depends on a bunch of factors.

P.S. A while back there were a bunch of posts with the title "Professor
Shamir Arrested." Was it ever established whether or not the arrested
Shamir was in fact _our_ Adi Shamir? And what the charges were?
