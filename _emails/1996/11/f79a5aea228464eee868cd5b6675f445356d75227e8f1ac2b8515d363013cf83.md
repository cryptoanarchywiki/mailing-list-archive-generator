Rather infuriating, too, that newbies are PATRONISED. It's well known
among my own circle that forcible expulsions from mailing lists serve
the purpose of controlling the information-flow to _newbies_ mostly;
since hard-liners and experts know how to killfile anyone anyway...

But sometimes, in other mailing lists, "killfile-terrorism" appears,
meaning an attempt to influence EVERY newbie into killfiling someone
whose messages are no longer read, but the messages of his critics
are read.

It's a return to the MIDDLE AGES, because it means that the words of
the prosecutor are heard, but the defense of the accused is deleted.

Greek friends and I have been studying this Mechanism of Repression
for rather a long time. It's probably encouraged by the EFF, too, in
the sense that (the goal is): Turn the Internet into cows and sheep
flocked together by pimp-cowboy list-owners.

It nearly turned me into a Yankee-hater till I realized there are
quite a few open-minded Americans similarly infuriated and concerned.

One Net-friend of mine (an American lady) has a doctorate in History
and Law and remarked that FEW PEOPLE IN THE STATES REALIZE WHAT THIS
IS ALL ABOUT, and how EASY it is for the freedom-bashers to succeed.

Lastly, I have now read nearly ALL of Dimitri Vulis' postings (in
the F-K list), and consider it CRIMINAL censorship if anyone tries
to stop him from speaking out. His talent at exposing fallacies is
magnificient.

This is the beginning of the END of pimping-on-the-net in the
name of "privacy".

George
