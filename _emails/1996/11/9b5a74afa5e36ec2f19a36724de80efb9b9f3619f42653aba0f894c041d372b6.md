As the smoke from the first rounds of cyber-gunfire of the Gilmore vs
Vulius shootout were wafting thru C-space several of us were bemoaning the
fact that the entire issue hadn't been handled thru creative filtering on
the part of list members as opposed to the heavy-handed "Big-Bro'ish" plug
pulling by Mr. Gilmore.  The "net-loon noise" level increase was
predictable.  Like you I will continue to perform creative filtering in
order to extract the 4 out of 240 messages worth reading in any given 48
hour period.
