But note that both their licensees, Sony and Philips, are foreign
companies.  Presumably they will just manufacture the boxes outside
the U.S. when they want to market them outside the U.S.

As far as I know, the only person convicted of shipping cryptographic
devices outside the U.S. without a license was guilty of shipping a
satellite TV descrambler to Latin America.  So there is some sort of
precedent.  (And, of course, no First Amendment problem.)

But there is a big question as to whether WebTV violated the ITAR by
transfering cryptographic _information_ to the licensees.
