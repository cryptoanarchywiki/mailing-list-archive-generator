That cocksucker is not dumb enough to try that.  It is him who

Maybe because John Gilmore is a faggot and takes it up
the ass.  That was the real reason behind the clash.  Dr. Vulis
just does not like Faggots, and Gilmore has admitted to being queer.
The one thing must be said about the Internet is that Faggots are
not allowed to have any Authority positions, and this John Gilmore
Faggot violates that rule.

Never trust anybody who does not fuck cunt.
