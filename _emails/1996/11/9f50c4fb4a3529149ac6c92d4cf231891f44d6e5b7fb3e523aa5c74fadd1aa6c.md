<sigh> GAK - Government Access to Keys and corporate control of encryption procedures &
keys are two completely different issues. This is just more smoke and mirrors to cloud &
confuse the issue. There are many solutions currently available for a company to handle
the encryption of their data including the use of "master keys" to prevent data loss (an
option available even with PGP). Government mandated infrastructure of GAK is unnecessary
and unwarranted for such purposes.
