Nope; It's the truth. Expressed like a sarcastic joke as well, but
it's _true_. And not intended to be a troll at all.

As regards the "gullibility", it's plainly dangerous; And cultivated
by the Media, apparently stronger in the U.S. than in many other places.

But: How many times do I have to state explicitly that my grumbles about
America are not "anti-American" (troll) propaganda? Nope; They're grumbles
about _freedoms_, that if you Americans lose, the rest of the world will
_also_ lose, (even quicker, I think)... Here is a REAL example:



(written by E. Francis, on the "Trilateral Commission", and distributed
 to all members of his own -private- mailing list, of which I'm a part).
