Ah, so let's ignore the risks, on the grounds that we have no idea what
they might be, or their magnitude.  That's clever.  I like that.

Your circle of associations must be limited.

Agreed, but since you do not quantify the magnitude of either of these,
even in terms of speculation, I'm not sure what your point is.

And no one can answer that question but you.  Privacy is a personal
decision.  I'm sure there are many out there who will suffer no harm even
if their SSN is published in the Wall Street Journal.

Why, however, fail to take out insurance when the cost is so low?  Really
it doesn't take much in the way of effort or money to assure one's
privacy.  (Hint: It's getting cheaper every day in some ways).

Answer: Nearly all of the cost of privacy is concentrated in set up cost.
Maintaince costs are minimal once set up has been made.  Yet getting over
that first hurdle is the biggest leap.
