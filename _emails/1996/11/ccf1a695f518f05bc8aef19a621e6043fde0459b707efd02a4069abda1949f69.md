We kept the control structure of the original ui version by "Matthew".
But the compatibility of 2.63ui has been expanded to allow it
to Export public keys generated with Version=3 (Legal_Kludge=on)
to old versions (2.3a) of PGP.

See the original announcement for the numerous fixes & enhancements
not currently available in 2.6.2 or 2.6.3ia including

Added CONFIG.TXT parameters/functions LabelEncrypt and PrePendSigV
Expanded disk write error checking
Ability to edit other people's keys's UserID's.

We have no current plans re PGP 3.0. Probably a GNU version of it
is not legally possible. But if source is released independent
enhancements would be, depending on the license.

It also remains to be seen if or how fast PGP 3.0, if it ever
comes, will supplant previous versions of PGP in public
acceptance.

Yes. Please send me a copy and we'll take a look at it. But the
external stealth utility currently available is quite adequate in
my view.
