Very important admission here: WATCH out what you say, folks, from now
on. Say it _real_ nice, or else you WON'T GET HIRED!!! No "abuse", from
now on... :-)

aha, aha, aha! NOW I understand the insecurity and the fear of young
*unemployed* Americans. NOW I understand... :-)

Likewise. But ONLY publicly, in contrast to you (hiding it)...

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There was NO rant "against cypherpunks" as such.
You could label my text a 'rant', by all means, but I note with interest
your attempt to turn it "against cypherpunks" (Setting a new target to what
was only a... friendly-clay-bullet, dear Clay). :-)


I would never hire you. What I need is people with a VISION;
NOT people with IMPAIRED VISION, distorting things so unreliably.

I need TRUE VISIONARIES able to work creatively in High Technology.
People like Philip Kahn (Hurrah) and Richard Branson (Hurrah, Bravo);
even Bill Gates himself, were SELF-MADE visionaries.

In contrast... people "threatening others with unemployability files",
are CLAY MEDIOCRITIES.

Your reputation is correct, given the kind of people you are 'selling'.
(Slaves in fact, just like in the SLAVE TRADE times... -High I.Q. slaves).

I would suggest, Clay, that you are indeed doing a good Job. But if you
are a... "Cypherpunk" then... I am the Emperor of Mars! :-)

You know Clay, if only you knew what TREASURE you have giveth me today :-)
I never even knew this existed locked up inside a... Smelly Clay Gutter...

Many thanks anyway
