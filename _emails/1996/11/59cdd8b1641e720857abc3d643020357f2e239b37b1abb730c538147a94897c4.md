Actually, here are ten.
2^.5
3^.5
2^(1/3)
5^.5
5^(1/3)
7^.5
11^.5
13^.5
17^.5
Pi
For that patter the nth root of any prime number.
A lifetime of "pads" could be distributed in one trip.  Of course this still
means that you have to make the trip, and write down all of the above with a
referring codeword or number.
Cheap, I know.  Wonder if this type of "one time pad" is as foolproof as
truly randomly generated ones.
