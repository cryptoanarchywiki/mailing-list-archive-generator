You've got a low tolerance. I'd only give him a 7.

Wrong. The Cabal (TINC) voted en masse against rec.music.white-powder;
Declan took your side, and even violated the fascist Cabal Rules by 
distributing a marked ballot on a closed mailing list. He's been on the 
Cabal (TINC) shit list (TINSH) ever since.

Then why are you still posting? I thought The Cabal (TINC) had ordered 
you into the Gulag.
