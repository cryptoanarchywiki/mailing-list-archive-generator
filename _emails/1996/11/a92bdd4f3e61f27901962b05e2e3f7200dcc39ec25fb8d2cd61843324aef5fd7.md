Declan is putting his journalistic credibility on the line here...
What's he disagreeing with? John exercised his right to censor me, so I'm
a victim and this list as a whole is a victim. John can shut the whole thing
down and it will again be a victim. John's credibility was also a victim.

Welcome to Cypherpunks! It's remarkable that Declan is hosting the next
DCpunks gathering.

And heaven forbid you express an opinion that one of John "God" Gilmore's
ass-licking friends doesn't know what the hell he's talking about, and support
it with evidence. Declan spent about an hour picking my brain as to why Timmy
May doesn't know shit about cryptography, is a flamer and a racist and an
asshole. He chose not to print it, because he had nothing to rebut it with.

Yes. John Gilmore suffers from the realization of his own inadequacy.

You forgot "limp-wristed, EFFeminate, bearded, 50-ish blonde".

Thanks for the comments, Dale.
