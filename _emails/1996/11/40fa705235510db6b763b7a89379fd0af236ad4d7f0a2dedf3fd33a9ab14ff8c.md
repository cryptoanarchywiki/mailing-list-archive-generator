Well, uh, with all due respect, but while it's obviously true that we won't 
know EXACTLY how it'll be, that doesn't mean that no portion of we imagine 
will come true.  This is particularly true on the big issues.   For example, 
you hypothesized that "wide use of strong cryptography resuts in widely 
unpopular activities such as sarin attacks and political activities.  I 
pointed out, almost certainly correctly, that these are wrong:

1.  To believe that use in cryptography will result in greater numbers of 
random attacks on innocent civilians.  As I pointed out, the exact opposite 
should be true:  A greater ability to target the guilty means less reason to 
kill the innocent.

2.  To believe that political assassination will be unpopular even if the 
ordinary citizen has an effective say in who's going to die.


In other words, based on my understanding these beliefs are diametrically 
opposed to the truth.  Not simply a difference in extent, we're talking a 
180-degree change.

Your response is a sheepish, "but we won't really know until we see it 
happen."   Harrumph!

Which doomsayers?  What version of "doom"?

I suppose that depends a lot on what a person means by the phrase, "our 
society."  Used as you (and maybe she, as well) this sounds like a 
code-word.  To a statist, "society" is basically the stratification system 
that has developed to let one group of people control another.  By that 
standard, cryptoanarchy WILL "result in the breakdown of our society."   But 
that's all for the good.
