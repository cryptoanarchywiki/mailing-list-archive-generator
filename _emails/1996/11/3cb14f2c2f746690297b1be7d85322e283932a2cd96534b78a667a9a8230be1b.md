Positive publicity?  How about Iraq?  What kind of computer equipment does
the Army have?  What happens when the Iraqi Army suddenly becomes able
to conspire?

What if they were provided only with authentication of anonymous
identities.  How much could they do with "underground newspapers"
that traveled on sneaker net?

Pornography is a powerful motivator that need not involve money.
The CIA used to trade porn for secrets during the Cold War.  It seems

who were not allowed to leave custody during their first two years
of service.
