     Believe me, if Blacknet ever becomes a reality, there will be 
military secrets for sale.

     The little guys corruption isn't a secret. I was there, and I know. 
Little People have Little Minds, and the scope of their corruption is 
mostly minor and annoying.

     They did a better job when the governments _didn't_ run them, or at 
least the Federal Government didn't run them.

     The US Postal System is not a government agency, it is a private 
company with a guarenteed monopoly.

    Things like Jails for drug users, Massive corruption and forced 
economic redistribuion. Idiotic laws &etc. Yes, lots of things that wouldn't
be there.
