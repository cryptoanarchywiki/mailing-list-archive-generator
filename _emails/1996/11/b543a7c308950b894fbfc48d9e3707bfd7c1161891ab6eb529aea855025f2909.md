Numerous requests? - I was right, he is halucinating...

Oh do be quiet you self satisfied smug little man.


Every single member of this list and indeed of other forums in which 
you post (I don`t know of any but I assume it is not just us you 
annoy) knows you are a fool.

Some while ago I seem to recall you offering to sell your company for 
one dollar if anyone could break your last algorithm, it was sumarily 
broken - why are you still owner of the company? - Oh I get it, they 
wouldn`t pay a dollar for it, neither would I. But seriously, was 
this you, and why didn`t you sell the company, and how are people to 
trust you now knowing this past debacle...

Go away, you are like an unpopular bore at a party who doesn`t seem 
to realise that everyone wants him to leave....
