Well I can give you a couple of examples from personel "suffering" from loss of privacy:

#1. While living in KC I had a co-worker obtain my SS# which he then used to have all his
utilities put in my name. (Utility companies only asked for SS#, Name & Place of
employment). I did not find this out until 9mo. later when I went to have utilities turned
on in my new house. (I was previously living in an apartment which utilities were included
in the rent). It took several months, an attorny & many calls to the utility board to get
the mess straightend out.

#2. The Ill. State Police got my name cross-referenced with a convicted fellon in thier
computer system. Didn't find this one out until I needed to get my security clearance
renewed for a contract. Needless to say the client was not pleased. This took over a year
to get straightend out and god only knows how many other computer systems still has me
listed as a convicted car theif. Funniest part is that while this guy was rotting in jail
I was living overseas.

It is all too easy today with the current state of computer & information technology to
get f***ed. Needless to say I take my privacy much more seriously than I did before.
