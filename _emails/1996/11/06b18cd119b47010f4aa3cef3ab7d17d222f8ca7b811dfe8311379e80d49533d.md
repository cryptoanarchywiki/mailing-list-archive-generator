Hmmm I don't think they actually had a Key Escrow Support. My understanding was that
the user could create a master key that could be used to decrypt messages from the
other keys. This was done in responce to the needs of some of their corprate users
that needed a way to decrypt company info. It could be quite devistating if a vip for
company x encrypted vital corporate files and then quit/fired/died and those file
were nolonger able to be retreived.

I am not sure exactly how they had this mechanism set up but I am pretty sure this
was somthing the user had to actively set up as aposed to somthing done automatically
with out the user's knowledge. 

I can see how this could be abused though for a GAK system though I never did see
anything from ViaCrypt that they supported any of the Clipper/GAK crap from our
government.

Does anyone know if you can purchace a commercial license from ViaCrypt/PGP Inc. but
use the standard PGP for commercial purposes?
