"It doesn't exist".  Well!  The difference between the intent of the law
and the "letter" of the law:  The Constitution, if it is about anything,
it is about Balance of Power. You could refer back to the DOI for examples
of how to settle BOP disparities when governments become too big for their
britches, or you could accept "creative civil disobedience" such as Common
Law Courts as a way to add some balance.  Unless, of course, you're the
troll you're talking about below.

An afterthought?  No.  The Constitution was a document provided at the
behest of the States, with their approval (not dictated by the Feds), and
those States would not ratify said document without the Enumeration of
rights now referred to as the Bill of Rights.  It's an enumeration only,
to tell the Feds that "these are your powers", etc., and "don't try to
mess with any of these things enumerated here in these 10 amendments",
and so forth.

Agent-provocateurs?  My, aren't we paranoid.  I hope the Thorn character
is someone else, not me.  If you read all or most all of my postings over
the past couple of months, you would see why the FBI and all those other
alphabet-agencies wouldn't hire me.  They had to cheat just to get me a
Confidential clearance in the Army (the lowest possible clearance).

I can't speak for Jim Bell, but my impression (for the 100th time) of AP
as stated in the postings is firmly this:  It's a warning about the real
possibility of such a system, given secure crypto technology and a more-
or-less anarchic net to host it.  As far as someone recommending it and
pushing for its acceptance, don't be so naive. The bad guys will have it
fully operational (if it is possible) *long* before you or your fellow
citizens have a crack at it, if ever.
