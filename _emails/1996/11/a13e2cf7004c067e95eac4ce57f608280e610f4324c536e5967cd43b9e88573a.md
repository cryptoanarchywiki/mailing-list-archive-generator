Such a case would obviously fail.  John has the right to ban anyone he
wants from a list that he is hosting.

I do question, though, whether or not it was the best way to handle the
situation.  As I have argued, the availability of end-user filtering made
banning Dimitri from the list unnecessary, IMHO.  And the list owner giving
people the boot sure doesn't fit with the picture I have had of what
cypherpunks was about.  YMMV.

I think that John is doing a lot of great things for crypto (his
participation in the Bernstein case, S/WAN, etc.) and I agree with at least
90% of the things I see him doing.  I think he made the wrong call with
Dimitri, though.

Actually, if John was trying to cut down on the noise by banning the Kook,
I think it's backfired.  It seems like there is even more irrational
chatter now...
