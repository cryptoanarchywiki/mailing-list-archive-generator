Hrmm.. One might point out that the only thing required for someone to
"mint" (and I use this term loosely) money is for popular belief that the
money is worth something.  What do you think a cashier's check is?  Other
notable versions are (and I'm sure somebody is going to say "but its
represintative of the US Dollar", even though its all dealing with money
that really isn't there) is AmEx, MasterCard, Visa, etc.
