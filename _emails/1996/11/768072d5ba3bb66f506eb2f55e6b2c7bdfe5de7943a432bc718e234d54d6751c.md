Hi,

I was sort of tired of endless talk that "IPG algorithm was not 
peer-reviewed, blah blah blah, so we won't even look at it, 
blah blah blah", and decided to look at what Don Wood writes and
try to see how his program actually works. 

Of course, I am not an expert in cryptography, and will appreciate all
corrections. The web page to look at is http://www.netprivacy.com/algo.html,
and it describes IPG algorithm in some detail.

First of all, the description of the algorithm is extremely unclear. I
understand that this may be Don Wood's writing style, but it is certainly 
not the most efficient style for precise communications. I suggest that
Don tries to rewrite his description to be more structured.

Second, I seriously suspect that his algorithm of "trimming" is NOT
going to work right. Just to remind everyone, he generates pseudo-random
A(JV), B(JV), C(JV) such that

	16384 <  C < 20361
	         B < 12227
	A arbitrary (at least the web page contains no restrictions 
	  on the value of A).

and then goes on to "trimming" -- a process that obtains a new value
of A that is LESS than 16384 through this algorithm: 

       DO
         JV=JV+1
         IF JV=53 THEN JV=0
         A(JV)=(A(JV)+B(JV)) MOD C(JV)
       UNTIL A(JV)<16384

We shall first note that THERE ARE CASES WHEN THIS ALGORITHM WILL NEVER
STOP! For example, if all A values are _initially_ 16385 and all C
values are 16386 and all B's are 0, it is obvious that the pseudocode 
above will be stuck in endless loop.

No good for IPG algorithm.

in fact, if only some triplets of A, B, and C have B == 0 and 16384 < A < C,
these triplets will always be ignored (skipped) by his trimming process.

Second, IPG's claim that ``Of even greater importance is the second role
of producing a distribution of the numbers 0 to 16383, so that the
number of each of those numbers produce, asymptotically approach an
even distribution, in the same way that theoretically a true random
number generator produces a set of numbers whose frequency
asymptotically approach an even distribution'' is FALSE:

I do not see why the distribution of A's should necessarily contain all
numbers from 0 to 16383, less to "approach" an even distribution. For
example, if all initial A, B, and Cs are even numbers, we'll obviously
never get an odd number for A(JV), no matter how many iterations.

If, say, 40 out of 53 of triplets A, B, and C contain only even numbers
(not a statistical impossibility!), then about 75% of resulting values of
A(JV) will be even.

No good for the keystream. There are many more imperfections than just
related to all-even triplets.

Let's go on, to the description of the "scrambling tables" and 
actual encryption.

He uses three tables, DIFF, DISP, DETR, each containing 4096 elements.
DISP is randomly generated (or so I understand his term "prescrambled"),
DIFF is a random transposition of DISP (same values as in DISP, but in
another order), and DETR, again, is filled with some random data.

It does not really matter to my analysis how DISP and DETR are generated.

Here's how he encrypts the data (in a loop for I from 0 to 4095):

                       D1=(D1+A(JV)) AND 4095
                       D2=DISP((D2+D1) AND 4095)
                       F=DETR(D2)<<8
                       D3=(D3+D2) AND 4095
                       BUF(DIFF(I))=BUF(DIFF(I)) XOR (F+(DETR(DISP(D3))))

I.e., D1, D2, and D3 are regenerated each pass of the loop and then are
used to encrypt item DIFF[I] (i.e., 2-byte word with index DIFF[i], NOT
I). 

That is very bad: what it means is that we are not guaranteed that all
BUF[i] will be scrambled! It is fairly clear that about 1/(e*e) (e is
the base of natural logs) will be left unscrambled!!!

This follows from the fact that even with perfectly random numbers used
as DIFF[i], the probability that a cell J will be scrambled is 2/4096
(it is 2 and not 1 since each hit covers two bytes and not one).
Therefore, the probability  that cell J will be left unscrambled is

                (1-2/4096) ** 4096

which is approximately equal exp(-2) == 1/(e*e).

It means that 1 out of seven characters will be left unencrypted at all.

No good for a stream cipher. I think that his cipher could have been
made stronger if he actually did not use DIFF[i] as an index and used
I instead.

Still, of course, his algorithm has nothing to do with one time pads.
Since this is clearly not a matter of high theories but a simple question 
of accepted definitions, there is little point to argue about it and I
preferred to address details of his algorithm instead.

There may be more problems with IPG algorithm that I simply missed.

I would appreciate your corrections and notes.

Thank you.

	- Igor.
