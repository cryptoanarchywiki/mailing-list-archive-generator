Never, but he might get some Cygnus support employee to do it for him. :-)

John has the right to configure his private mailing list to reject submissions
from non-subscribers or even sepecific people - but not the balls.

Again John Gilmore/EFF demonstrate their true agenda: they can filter

to their corporate sponsors, such as net.pronography peddlers.

An excellent idea, Dr. Grubor! Shall we newgroup alt.flame.john-gilmore or
alt.bonehead.john-gilmore or both?
