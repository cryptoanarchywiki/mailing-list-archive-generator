This is a commonly held fiction that is not supported by the evidence. As stated
in another message, the infomration given out by ETS, who administer the GMAT
and SAT, indicate that there is a low correlation between GMAT scores and
successful completion of even first year education programs. This also ignores
the issue of why other, better, widely available predictors are not used
instead.

There was a good Scientific American article on cultural influences on learning
within the last year or two. It examined Asian groups noted achievements in
tests and the parental and cultural support for scholastic achievement.
 
Another anecdotal example is in the opening chapters of "Surely You're Joking,
Mr. Feynman" by Richard Feynman, the late Caltech professor and general bon
vivant. He describes how his mother introduced a doctor, a general and a
professor with the same respectful tones indicating to him that a career in
academia was as highly valued as any other high position in society.

I do to. But how good are your feelings as predictors of actual success?
