Pity! Aga should respong to this lady's needs FIRST! :-)

BTW, (paraphrasing Speedy Gonzales)...

I think she really fucks for money, but since you are an aga
she'll fuck you for nothing! :-)

I can see the beginnings of an... S/M cyber-romance in these lines.
ROTFL!!!

Aga should not forget to carry a... cane in his briefcase.

The more arrogant they sound at first, the more submissive their
fantasies are!  (ALL masochists in fact).  :-)


Love and Jelly Babies
George

P.S.  My first guess is that Sandy is a Piscean, and Aga is a Taurus.
      It would work out better with him being a Scorpio or a Leo, however.
      (My second guesses on Aga). My second guess on Sandy is that she's
      a Virgo, however. In this case avoid her at all costs! ROTFL!!!!
