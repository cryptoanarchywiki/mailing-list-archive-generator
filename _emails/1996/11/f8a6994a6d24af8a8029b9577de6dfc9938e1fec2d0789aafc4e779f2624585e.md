9 words selected from a pool of 25,000 has an entropy of about
131 bits.  I could probably remember that.

Yes, if things go sour, I doubt many cypherpunks will be practicing
cryptoanarchists.

I am willing to accept that I can remember it.

You are beginning to convince me.

I am finding this all very persuasive, although I am still suspicious
of stegonagraphy.

It would be cool to have an exact specification and working machine.

This might even be easy enough to operate that non-technical people
could learn how to do it, which implies that there could be large
numbers of practicing cryptoanarchists.

What we need is an experiment.  Let's pick a country with a near
police state and design a system so that people in that country
can freely and securely communicate with each other and the outside
world with minimal chance of arrest.  Once the system is available,
we can see if it succeeds in the field.  I'll leave others to
suggest the target.

I still think the eventual payoff is a weak point, but it does make
me think that in order to stop cryptoanarchy, foreign travel and
foreign communication would have to be tightly controlled.  If
steganographic evidence is the only evidence that can be collected
(and RC4 is strong) then it would be necessary to give the authorities
great flexibility.  Which means that it is beginning to look more and
more like a bona fide police state as Tim suggested.

While payment is a weak point, there are many cryptoanarchic activities
that don't involve payment, such as participating in mailing lists,
which people may like to do even when their governments disapprove.

Anyway, you have certainly given me a lot to think about.  I still
have some doubts about safety from tempest attacks and the like,
but my basic claim that you can stop cryptoanarchy without full
deployment of a police state is looking weak to me right now.
