Actually, at the risk of interrupting your little diatribe, the average
welfare recipient is on the dole for under 4 months.  While we're on the
subject, I may as well point out that the average welfare recipiant is also
white, lives in a lower-middle class suburban neighborhood, and has two or
fewer children, but you'd never know it from watching the pols...

At any rate, as I mentioned in my last post, you and I are paying three times
as much to corporate welfare as to personal welfare...

Actually, the US has one of the lowest tax rates in the world, and far
less of your tax money goes to welfare (or foreign aid, or disaster relief,
etc.) than in any other industrialized nation...

Yes, your taxes do go to those who are producing nothing, namely a bunch of
CEOs and wealthy shareholders

Or welfare payments of up to $500 million at a shot, if you happen to be GE, or
General Motors...

The only examples of large-scale socialism we have are in extremely statist
environemnts.  Statism is brutal and innefficient no matter what economic
system it pays lip service to.
