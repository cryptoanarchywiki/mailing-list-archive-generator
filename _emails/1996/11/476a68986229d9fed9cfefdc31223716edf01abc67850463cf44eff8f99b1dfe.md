He's mistaken, at least for analog cellphones in the US - digital
cellphones (just starting to come in now) may have some form
of protection.

Before a law was passed, it was easy and legal to listen in on
cellphones on most scanners and many ham radio outfits (and
even some UHF TVs). Now it's merely easy.

It's kind of pathetic - I'm sure that the billions lost to cellular fraud 
far outweigh the value of crimes that the  LEA groups have been 
able  prevent by preserving their ability to illegally eavesdrop on 
cell calls without a warrant.
