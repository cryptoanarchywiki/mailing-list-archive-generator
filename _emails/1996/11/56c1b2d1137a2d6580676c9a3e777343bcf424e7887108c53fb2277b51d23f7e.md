Speaking of Feynman (who was not only a scientific genius, but was rather
shrewd in his personal judgements as well), when approached by David Lifton
(I believe) on the subject of the sudden large-volume displacement of JFK's
upper torso in the fatal head shot, Feynman found a subtle inconsistency
in the frames of the film, and thereby excused himself from rendering an
opinion.

For comparison, when Allen Dulles was confronted directly with the same
evidence, he said "I don't see any backward movement".
