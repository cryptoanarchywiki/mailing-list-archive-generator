(Most of the message left for clarity)
I would type dungeon at the prompt and Ctrl-Alt-6 at the first door.
But that's just me.
BTW.  The hypothetical Steno program (Trojan Horse) that I wrote about
earlier (and that this refers) could have its own source hidden in the
opening screen of both the game and the bmp that I would use for my windows
background.  If anyone has access to the source of a soon to be released
game, they could add this to it as an easter egg, thus, the author would be
spreading a very powerful tool which would be advertized several months
after it was released.  If it were added to a program with references to
cypherpunks or similar, it might even reach the (primary) target audience.
