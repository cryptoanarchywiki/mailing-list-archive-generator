      Nope, you have to make your own. The Kit is mostly Education, which
is available to all.

     It would not be censorship, it would be Conspiracy to murder (I 
believe, the Legal types could give you the proper charge) on Vulis's part,
and attempted murder on the Hit Man's part.

     That is NOT censorship. A rake is not a shovel, you can dig with it,
but that doesn't make it a shovel. It simply isn't.

     Red Herring. Gilmore never claimed ownership over anyones writing, 
nor did he even make the claim that Vulis didn't have the right to 
say what he said, all he "claimed" (note quotes) was that Vulis wasn't 
welcome to say it here.

     As the poets who send their drivel/art to a poetry mag. are the 
WRITERS of that magazine.

     Setting up an entire Offset Web Press is difficult, setting up a 
press that will print on boxes and shit is not easy. Setting up 
a small hand operated press isn't that difficult. Note, I didn't say 
build, I just said set up. I have, in the past run a Vandercook Universal,
a small letter press. These are available used at very low costs by 
hobbyists all over America, and probably other parts of the world. Ture
your output is limited to what you can crank thru the press, but this
is just an example. 

    As I noted somewhere else, there are always Photocopiers, and 
small presses will never go away, there just is too much market for short
run stuff that the boys with the big presses don't want to deal with.

     Very few of the people on this list were "invited" most simply 
wandered in.

     Try this, organize a small "open meeting" of around 1500 to 2000
people. Show up, act like a fucking drunk, scream rude and untrue things
at the speakers, piss on the other guests. Let me know if people try
to get you to leave.

     It wan't his opnions, it was his actions. That is the difference.
