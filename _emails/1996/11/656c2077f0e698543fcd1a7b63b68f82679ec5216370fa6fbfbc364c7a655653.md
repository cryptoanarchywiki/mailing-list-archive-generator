What a crock!!

socialist/communist are theifs; plain & simple. They beleive they have the
right to steal from one to give to another. 

capitalists beleive in an exchange in property/services at a rate the
market will bare.

socialists example: You have somthing I want/need & I am going to take it
from you.

capitalists example: You have somthing I want/need what can I give you in
exchange.

socialism uses FORCE to take what it wants while the capitilism you have a
free & volintary exchange.

why is this so hard to understand??
