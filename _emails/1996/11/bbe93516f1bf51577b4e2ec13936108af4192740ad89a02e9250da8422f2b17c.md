Simple. Filter by content without admitting that you are doing so. Libel 
people. Suppress discussion.

In short, do precisely the opposite of what Gilmore has done.

I had been assuming, incorrectly, that the fight-censorship list was 
still down because of the hard drive crash on vorlon. As a matter of 
fact, I see that volume 2, issue 4 of the fight-censorship digest 
contains a message from me, though without credit.

If you have a problem with the below, please discuss the matter 
publicly, as Gilmore has discussed Vulis publicly.
