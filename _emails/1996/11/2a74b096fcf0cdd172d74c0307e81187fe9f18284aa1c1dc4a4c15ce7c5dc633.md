heh, I find Unicorn's zeal to sue anyone for anything quite comical
and suggestive of a high degree of immaturity.

but as to your point, the recent Forbes article on Bidzos makes it
clear that weilding a legal sword alone can be used quite
shrewdly, strategically, and effectively. 
the article is quite interesting in how it suggests
RSA was largely built on threatening to sue people. of course this
is slightly skewed, because RSA has done things like software
development that the article didn't mention.

actually the lesson seems to be that if you have a software
patent, the law can be your friend (esp. if you are a business), 
but if you want to sue someone who calls you names, the law is not very
accommodating. sorry, Unicorn, maybe you can lobby to fix this
little deficiency. <g>
