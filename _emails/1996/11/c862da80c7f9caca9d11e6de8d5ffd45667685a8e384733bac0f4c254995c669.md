I have a hard time believing that Netscape caved. As I wrote in July, HP 
was working on selling our children's birthright to obtain an export 
license for their product. But Netscape participating in this just 
doesn't sound right.

One possibility is that all crypto is done in hardware. The recent 
announcements by many hardware manufacturers that smartcard readers will 
be included in all their products (MS will put them into their keyboards) 
might get the necessary infrastructure deployed.

Of course, no crypto will work without the hardware token. The 
applications use signed code. Hardware tokens are only valid for a 
certain time. Making future mandatory upgrades to Fortezza, etc. a cinch.
