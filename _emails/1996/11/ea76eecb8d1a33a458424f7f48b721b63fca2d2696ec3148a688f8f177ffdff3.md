Banning Dimitri was a really dumb thing to do.  The list is
archived practically in real time on the Web and anyone can post
whether or not they are subscribed, not to mention the
availability of anonymous remailers, with which Cypherpunks is
closely associated.

So we had a unilaterial act, which was completely unenforcable,
that made us all look like a bunch of clueless hypocrites in the
process and filled the list with yet another pointless flame war.

Indeed, we have here another classic example of not quite
grasping the issues involved, much like what we see on a regular
basis from the EFF as they merrily capitulate right and left with
Congressrodents on bills most Cypherpunks find unacceptable.
