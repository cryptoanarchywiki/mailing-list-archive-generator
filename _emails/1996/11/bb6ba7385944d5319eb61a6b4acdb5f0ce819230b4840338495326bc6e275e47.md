-.Isn't it worrying that so many people can happily devote their time

        well, 40 years ago when I was still an innocent farm child...

    then                            today

    people are basically good.      ...until money is involved.
    of course it's legal.           ...but is it moral? 
    ...things were only fattening.  ...immorality: not getting in on the take
    no need for film ratings        ...is it R, NC, or XXX?
    OK, until proven otherwise      ...God gets credit, the rest pay cash                               

        then there are the the flaming liberals, the Better Red than 
    Deads, the Sierra Club, the ADL, 'THE' Weisman, Arafat, whatever the
    hardline premier 'friend' of Arafat  --and certainly we must include
    the absolute amorality of Bubba and Bitch.

        actually, I can handle a few of the obnoxious.  if they are remote,
    who cares?  if they get too close and persist --well, there are means
    and there are means.

    Cyberspace and Information are Freedom!  
        FUCK your WIPO, too.
