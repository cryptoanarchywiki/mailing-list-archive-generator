[Where is "here" for every list member?]

Not bloody likely, no, but Mr. Kasczynski or the Symbionese Liberation
Army could take a disliking to you for similar reasons. And you never 
know where you might travel. I've got a journalist friend who's paranoid 
about appearing at any political event because she's afraid she won't be 
allowed back into China or Southeast Asia if it comes out that she gives 
a damn about human rights.

A seasonal haiku, original author unknown:

Open your present
No, you open your present
Kasczynski Christmas
