Look, 

do you seriously think that university researchers, professors and 
data security consultants have nothing better to do with their time 
than look at your pathetic collection of cryptographic stocking 
fillers.

I thought you had finally gone away when I saw no posts from you for 
about a week. I am depressed beyond belief to see you have returned 
to interrupt the flow of discussion.... Leave and never return...

I truly have never hear anyone speak as much bollocks as you in my 
entire life, even those who have studied the art for many years...
