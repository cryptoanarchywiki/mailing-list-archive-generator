A valid fear, given the times we live in.

If jurors can be dismissed for knowing "too much" about the O,J.
case--knowing how to _read_ ensures this--then we are probably
fast-approaching the point where judges are recused (or whatever the word
is) from hearing cases where they've had any education whatsover on.

(An exaggeration, of course.)

In any case, I don't think trying to influence the thinking of one of the
thousands of local judges is an efficient use of our time. Jim may enjoy
it, which is fine, but this is why I never took even a millisecond to write
a special essay for Judge Kozinski.

I place more faith in seeing the fundamental ground truth changed, via
technology.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
