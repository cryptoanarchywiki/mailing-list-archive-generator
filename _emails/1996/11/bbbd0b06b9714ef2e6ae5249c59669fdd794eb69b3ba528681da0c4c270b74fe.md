December's Internet World contains a good article by futurist James Burke
('Connections', and 'The Day the Universe Changed') on the societal impact
of the Net.  He discusses the international legal challenge of the Net,
privacy/anonymity, its effect on copyright and publishing, and worldwide
intellectual growth.

                          Hacker Opportunities
                        (Let's Make Lots Of Money)

I've got the brains, you've got the tricks
Let's make lots of money
You've got the code, I've got the hooks
Let's make lots of ...

I've had enough of scheming and messing `round with jerks
My crypto code's compiled, I'm afraid it doesn't work
I'm looking for a partner, someone who gets things fixed
Ask yourself this question: do you want to be rich?

I've got the hacks, you've got the keys
Let's make lots of money
You've got the code, I've got the hooks
Let's make lots of money

You can tell I'm educated, I studied at CalTech
Doctored in mathematics, I could've been set
I can program a computer, choose the perfect time
If you've got the inclination, I have got the crime

Ooooh, there's a lot of opportunities
If you know when to take them, you know
There's a lot of opportunities
If there aren't, you can make them (Make or break them)

I've got the brains, you've got the tricks
Let's make lots of money
Let's make lots of ...

You can see I'm single-minded, I know what I could be
How do you feel about it? Come, take a walk with me
I'm looking for a partner regardless of expense
Think about it seriously, you know it makes sense

Let's (Got the brains)
Make (Got the tricks)
Let's make lots of money (Money)
Let's (You've got the code)
Make (I've got the hacks)
Let's make lots of money (Money)
I've got the brains (Got the hooks)
You've got the code (Got the keys)
Let's make lots of money (Money)
Money!
