Surely someone who can't learn to format their text to 80 columns (perhaps
because he uses a dead operating system) has no credibility when he speaks
of technical things he clearly knows nothing about.

You remind me of a student in my C++ class who just couldn't understand why a
certain C expression evaluated to what it did. We made it simpler and simpler
until we had no variables left and this expression (w/o parens) on the board:
                                   1+1*2
The student forcefully argued that it should be equal to 4.

Another sign of cluelessness. OS/2 is dead. I've beein using OS/2 since v 1.0,
but now I'm moving to NT 4.0. I need to find the device drivers for all my
hardware.

Choke on your turkey. :-)
