Photobuster is a spin off from a specialty electronics company (Grand 
Systems) who saw the need for a system to foil the photo radar picture. We 
realize that people like your selves don't usually speed on purpose and 
can't afford to pay hundreds of semolies just because you look away from the 
speedometer from time to time.
Our easily installed electronic Photobuster unit is a an electronically 
triggered device that mounts in the rear window with a satellite unit that 
mounts at the license plate.  It watches the right side of the road for a 
photo radar setup. If you are driving at speeds in excess of the operators 
setting on the photo radar, it will attempt to photograph your car. When it 
does this the Photobuster senses the attempt and triggers a return response 
rendering the radar photo useless. It has an audible warning and a visual 
light to let you know each time you save 100 bucks. This unit only triggers 
if the photo radar attempts to photograph your car.
NOTE: Photobuster has nothing covering your plate as is with other filter, 
poleroid and lenticular optical devices. We are told it is not legal in most
areas, to install any kind of plastic cover over the plate, see through or 
not.
