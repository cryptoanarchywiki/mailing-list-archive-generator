It also lets the Feds say, "You can't have something until everyone has
it."  Besides we have universal service right now (in America anyway).
Much more universal service than the Feds would have provided with decades
of bureaucratic futzing around.  Anyone in the US who wants to get wired
can do so for very little money.  All it takes is desire.  The government
can't provide the desire.
