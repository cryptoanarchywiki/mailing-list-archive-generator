TeX *may* not be easy to learn (the price of The TeXBook is well worth
it), but it's not hard to use.  It's not suited to graphic-laden
documents, though.

   many would pay good money for Linux native versions of programs like 
   Wordperfect, Corelpaint & draw, Pagemaker , etc.

WordPerfect, at least, is available (from Caldera).  And then there
are the ApplixWare and StarOffice suites.  I've been hearing rumours
about CorelDraw for quite a while, but nothing concrete yet AFAIK, and
Corel are supposed to be doing a Java-based office suite that will run
under Linux+JDK.
