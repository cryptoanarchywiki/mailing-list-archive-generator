i think that i understand what you are trying to say, however, my purpose
in asking for this information has nothing to do with what i know.
i am pulling together a series of tests for our firewall, and am not
satisfied that the entries/cracks that i know are the only ones that exist,
therefore, i ask others for their input.  seems reasonable, doesn't it?

thanks for you response.

cheers,
	-paul
