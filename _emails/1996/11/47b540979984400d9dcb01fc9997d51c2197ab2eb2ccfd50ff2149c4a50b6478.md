Hey motherfucker, I TOLD YOU to leave out the stupid
cypherpunks header!  Just when are you going to learn
to listen?!!  You have been around those faggots too much!

Faggots have NOTHING to do with Fredom of Speech!

Hey cocksucker, the KKK have nothing to do with faggots!

There is a basic understanding in life by ALL GOOD MEN
that Faggots are defective creatures.  NOBODY wants to
be seen with or associated with faggots!

John Gilmore is a Faggot, therefore he is defective.
And we question any of his associates.
open and shut case.
