Hardly very effective, Mr. Rick Smith. You are not nearly so anonymous as
you seem to think. Your "Smith" disguise falls apart in a few cycles of a
Pentium.

(And bit rot is rarely effective...trust me. With XORs and comparisons,
even highly damaged records will be trivially reconstructable, with a
ruthless efficiency that will give capabilities 10 years from now that will
stun nearly everyone on this list. Deja News and Alta Vista on 10 years of
steroids, located offshore to enable regulatory arbitrage.)

To illustrate, let me call up my BlackNet Dossier Service entry on you.
www.black.net... I'll just pick _part_ of your entry, from exactly 30 years
ago:

[,,,,much stuff about Mr. Smith elided....]

....1966-67, student, Langley H.S., Langley, VA...interest in "Cretaceous
extinction" [Agency note: this interest in "extinction"...is it abnormal,
or just precocious?]...known to associate during this year with
troublemakers, incl. J. Landua, W. Winkowski, and [deleted for security
reasons by ONI]...

...

So, Mr. Smith...is the dossier entry basically correct? Were you in fact
living near Langley? Why? Is it true that your high school was on the other
side of the fence from the CIA?

Nationally enquiring minds want to know.
