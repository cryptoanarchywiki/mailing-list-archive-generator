If mandatory GAK were imposed, reviewing messages is easy, even with
inter-agency fighting.  Or, encryption in general could just be
forbidden if GAK created too much hassle.

In practice I suspect that good stego is hard.  You don't have to be
right every time when you look for it, just some of the time.  When
you see packets that seem kind of funny to you, the judge issues you
a warrant and you search the suspect's house and computer very carefully.
If stego is in use, the software that generated it can be found.  Then
you hand out a life sentence.

Yes, this would be somewhat expensive.  But if the number of suspects
is small, it is completely feasible.

You might also identify suspects in other ways.  Maybe that Jim McCoy
is looking a little too successful or perhaps he made an unwise comment
to a "friend" who reported him.  That could easily be grounds for a
warrant and subsequent change of quarters.

Which technicalities protected the Japanese-Americans during World War II?
As you probably know, these people were not protected by our legal system.
Their bank accounts were frozen and they were forced to sell their property
in less than two weeks.  They were effectively stripped of their assets.
Then, they were carted off to concentration camps and left there for years.
This was allowed to happen because there was strong public support for it.

The legal system would have to be stretched considerably less to outlaw
strong crypto and make it stick.
