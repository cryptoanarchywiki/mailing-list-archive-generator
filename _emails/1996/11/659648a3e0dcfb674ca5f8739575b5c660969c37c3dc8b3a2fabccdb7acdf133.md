It is not a requirement in a libertarian forum to tell the truth.

You also seem to be implying that people need protecting from 
Dimitri, much the same authoritarian argument we hear from govt.

I understand the point here but I suggest a note at the top of the 
"welcome to cypherpunks" note every new subscriber gets explaining 
who Dimitri is and how to set up their mailer software to block his 
posts.
