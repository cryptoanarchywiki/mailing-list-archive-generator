But its not a matter of "giving it up", its more "not being given it."
There is little control with cash now, only some if the serial numbers are
prerecorded and watched for, and even then not to a paint where they can
come stomp on you before you walk out of the mall. But I agree, it is
unlikely that banks would pass up the opportunity, all in the name of
"loss reduction" and "profit through sharing of demographics"
