You're still trying to cover up John Gilmore's dishonorable censorship,
which he described as "act of leadership". Hitler-like leadership indeed!

You may recall that when I first reported that I've apparently been forcibly
kicked off this mailing list, Timmy May posted a denial. Now Timmy May doesn't
want journalists to write about this incident, because it exposes John Gilmore
and a hypocrite.

Of course John Gilmore has the right to censor his private mailing list
- why are you denying that he did?

Count me in: I too think that Mike's a fool and an EFF/Cabal stooge.
