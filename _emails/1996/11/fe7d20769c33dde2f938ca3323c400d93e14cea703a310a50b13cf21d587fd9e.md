Since it IS private, the owner has to justify NOTHING, vis-a-vis the list.
We _choose_ to supplicate to join; we are _allowed_ to join (or not allowed)
by the owner's grace; we may always _choose_ to unsubscrive [sic]; if we do
it correctly, we are off the list.

Let me repeat, the onus is NOT on the owner to justify the use of his property.
Cordially,
