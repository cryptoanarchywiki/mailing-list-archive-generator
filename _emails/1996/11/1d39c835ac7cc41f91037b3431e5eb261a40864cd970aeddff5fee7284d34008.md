Sandy is suggesting (demanding?) that all cypherpunks subscribers "accept" without
question or proof John's generosity, i.e., the existence of the list being prima
facie evidence of same.

Well, Sandy, if this were a list sharing cookie recipes or some such thing, I'd grant
you the point, but it's not.  It's a list which would necessarily be watched closely
by neo-government factions such as NSA, and *quite* possibly be a trolling operation.

Please don't come back with the "so why are you here?" argument - after all, I have
my reasons, just like you.
