I think it relates to crypto policy via policy in general, also to both the
libertarian and the inevitable cryptoanarchy argument we are currently tossing
about and brought to mind a comment a few months back from Tim about how the
occasional female members of this list tended to not make sense a lot of the
time.

Sorry if it wasn't clear enough. I had expected a comment regarding the smart
bomb message since it would have been better to send to the risks list.

Ciao,
James
