Creative accounting is the name of the game. Pay attention, IRS...

No, I think he understands that the cost of good sold and other costs are
taken out of "sales" to compute his contribution.

And of course you use the infrastructure paid for with your taxes and
other people's taxes (state and federal).

In Germany, a company can put practicially inlimited amounts of money into
tax-deductible reserves. E.g., you can estimate that once in ten years you'll
be unable to collect a debt of 10DEM. Every year you set aside 1DEM as a sort
of self-insurance reserve. The revenue authorites don't bother you if the
assumption of 10DEM every 10 years is overly pessimistic. Therefore German
corporations generally pay little income tax.

Dividends are NOT tax-deductible in the U.S. On the other hand, interest is.
Therefore it's sometimes more profitable for a company to raise money by
issuing bonds (debt) and paying tax-deducuble interest than by selling its
stock (equity) and paying non-decuctible dividentds to stockholders.

That varies with the locale - here I pay the federal income tax plus the New
York State income tax plus the New York City income tax. I once had a job offer
from IBM at $79K/year in Boca Raton (which I eventually didn't take anyway) -
it's a ridiculous salary in NYC, but a decent one in Florida.
