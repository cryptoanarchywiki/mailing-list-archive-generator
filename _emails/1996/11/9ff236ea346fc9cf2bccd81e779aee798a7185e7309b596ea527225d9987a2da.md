I can see how the chemical/drug thing works, and I can see how they can
easily control Public Key (PGP) encryption, but if you are suggesting
that they can effectively eradicate private key encryption, that would
seem to be an impossibility.

BTW, if the current Public Key program(s) were prohibited, wouldn't new
versions using different schemes pop up everywhere?
