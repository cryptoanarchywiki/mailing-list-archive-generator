just heard an interesting rumor that Timmy has been blacklisted
from working anywhere here in Colorado as a dangerous anarchist
and/or lunatic revolutionary.

but perhaps he can still work in Silicon Valley if anyone there is
willing to hire a debauched millionaire playboy.  the standards
are different where no one wants to live, I guess. (hmmmm, catch
that recent cool article on CO in National Geographic?)

besides, everyone here in CO would prefer all the
anarchists stay in CA anyway so they can all be taken care of
in one fell swoop with the next "big one".. did I feel
a little "trembling" over there or is it just the standard cpunk
cowardice? (hehehe)
