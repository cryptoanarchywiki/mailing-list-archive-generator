many would pay good money for Linux native versions of programs like 
Wordperfect, Corelpaint & draw, Pagemaker , etc.

Needs flesh.  What defines "alpha" or "beta" for purposes of bounty 
or is that up to the person initiating the bounty?

Do you have the charities in mind?  They should be listed in the 
abstract, I think.


Who will be publicize the initial bounty offer -- the server or 
bounty initiator?  Information about a specific software project will 
need to be disseminated beyond bounty.org.  


More details on conflict resolution are needed in a final draft.  The 
process and priorites the server administator will use to make his 
judgements should be abastractly discussed and possibly 1 or 2 
specific hypotheticals detailed.
