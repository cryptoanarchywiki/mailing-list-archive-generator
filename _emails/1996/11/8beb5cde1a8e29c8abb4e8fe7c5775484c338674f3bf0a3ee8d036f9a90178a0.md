Use the source, young Hal! While the White House Web site may not have it
online, Alta Vista turns up 113 hits (though not all valid) to it.

Basically, this was one of the alphabet soup of Emergency Orders, National
Security Decision Directives, and Executive Decisions passed or enacted
(sometimes in secrecy) during the last 30 years of the Continuing Emergency.

(Nixon's wage-price freezes, the oil embargo actions, the strategic
reserves, the anti-inflation measures, various Carter emergencies, and
various Reagan emergency orders, including NSDD-145, which directly affects
control of communicaitons, cryptography, etc.)

FEMA, the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency, took over several of these
emergency orders (the running of them) in the late 70s.

Standard stuff for we conspiracy buffs. One doesn't need to invoke
historical groups like the Illuminati to see that the levers of power are
pulled by strange folks.

One of the things that most people don't appreciate is that these emergency
orders are essentially never repealed. (Not too surprising--if I was in
government, I wouldn't voluntarily give back any additional powers, either.
And the only consituency for rolling them back is the membership of the
evil militias, so nothing happens.)
