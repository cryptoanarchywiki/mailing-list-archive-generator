Your logic is flawed.  Most registered voters have never even heard of Browne.
Those who have are probably not familiar with his views.  There are definitely
more people who have heard of Nader than Browne.  It's easy to understand why
this logic is incorrect: If Bob ran for president and the only people who voted
for him were three of his friends, this does not necessarily imply that there
are only three people in the entire country who have never heard of him.  It
does imply that Bob needs a lot more exposure.

If Browne's views were not popular, then he would have not been able to get on
the ballot in all 50 states.  Note that the libertarian party is the only
non-mainstream party in history to get a candidate registered in all 50 states
twice in a row.  It's also the third largest political party in the country.
The election turnouts for libertarian candidates for for senate and
representatives were published in many newspapers along with the democratic
and republican turnouts.  It was the only non-demopublican party listed.
