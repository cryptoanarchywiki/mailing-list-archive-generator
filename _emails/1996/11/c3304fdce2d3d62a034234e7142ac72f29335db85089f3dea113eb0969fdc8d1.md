  I've lost but one account--world.std.com (Software Tool &
Die) soon to be purchased by the conglomorate Plug Pullers
R US.  That was entirely related to a local rent control
matter.  Now I may be a 'twit'--that is an entirely
different matter.

   I would say though that if one makes false statements as has
this 'snow' character it indicates a lack of credibiltiy.

  Something you seem unable to do.  Isn't it odd how some will
tell you how insignificant and irrelevant you are only to devote
so much of their time and energy to you.  I find that very odd.

  Well thanks George but I do think his statement speak for themselves.
I'm not in the least concerned someone like him could harm me--in fact
I find it very amusing that he is deemed 'acceptable for that list
while Dr. Vulis is not.

   Well that's sort of like Tiny Tim Skirvin and his Global Killfile--
it does him more harm than those he is after--in fact little Tim reads
my every word.

  And based on lies as well--I've only had one account terminated--that
by Barry Shein who lives in Brookline, Ma. and that was entirely do
to real estate industry money and the rent control issue (a statewide
referrendum on rent control which existed only in Brookline, Cambridge,
and Boston)--many millions of dollars at stake there.  Shein is simply
a whore.

  Well my suggestion--given the size of the list and that we have
numerous sympathizers there--is to have all of their posts forwarded
and publically post them for free and open discussion.

                            Steve
