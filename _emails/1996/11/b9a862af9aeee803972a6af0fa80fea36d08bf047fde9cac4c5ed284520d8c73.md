Black Unicorn recently stated that had taken measures to shield
his identity so that people would be unable to cause harm to
his professional activities by making unsubstantiated claims
that could scare off prospective clients.

It appears now that this protection has evaporated.  It will not
be very hard in the future to put this information together with
other statements people may make about Mr. Unicorn.

We are hardly operating in a hostile environment.  Yet, somebody
who has apparently gone to some effort to have an anonymous
identity has been exposed.  The implications of this are worth
considering.
