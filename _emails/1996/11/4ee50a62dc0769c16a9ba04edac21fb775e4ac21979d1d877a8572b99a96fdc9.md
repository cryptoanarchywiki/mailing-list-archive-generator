	The reason I included ASCII and Vigenere was because they are very fast;
on a friend's machine, I can get 1.7mb/s with ASCII but only around 600k/s
with NewDES, the fastest "secure" cipher. I do agree that it is kind of
redundant to include both ASCII and Vigenere, as from a cracking
standpoint, they are both identical. As for Psuedo-RC4, that is just to try
to avoid a lawsuit from RSADSI; RC4 is a trademark. NewDES is an actual
algorithm; it's even mentioned in Applied Cryptography. It does have some
holes and is in fact less secure than DES (refer to Applied Cryptography
for details on this); I included that because it is fast and provides much,
much more security than ASCII or Vigenere, even if it is less secure than
DES.
