I don't think that an alert legisator will have any problems writing
laws that cover
whatever uses of cryptography they want to outlaw.  (Finding an alert
legislator might be
more of a problem...)

Consider this:  outlawing an algorithm is very similar to protecting
it's use
as intellectual property - which is what the Patent system in the US and
most other
countries is designed to do.  The description of "illegal" algorithms
could be lifted
directly from patents (both current AND expired, or if you're
sufficiently paranoid,
even from "refused" or ungranted applications) which apply to
cryptography.  

Imagine the creation of a branch of your favorite Government, let's call
it "Big Brother," 
whose job is to monitor patent applications worldwide for new crypto
techniques solely for
the purpose of branding them contraband.  Not so different from some of
the work the US FDA does.

Note that the market lock that PKP/RSA has on public key encryption in
the US is 
based on exactly this sort of algorithm protection, and if it's good
enough to reign in 
unbridled capitolism, it'll be good enough for the Justice Department to
litigate on. 
In effect, since PKP holds all the patents on public key in the US,
nobody else can use
these techniques without paying PKP or their licencees.  Outlawing just
those techniques
which are embodied in the PKP patents would be sufficient to outlaw all
public key encryption.

Note that issues like "is the patent valid" usually hinge on whether the 
authors of the patent were indeed the originators of the idea.  In the
case 
of outlawing the algorithms, it doesn't matter if the patent author was
the 
originator or not, or even if the patent is valid, still current, or
was intercepted when it was applied for and diverted to "Big Brother" 
instead of being granted.
