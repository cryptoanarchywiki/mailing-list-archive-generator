If you use procmail, you can use the following entry to support 
cypherpunks-specific killfile: 

:0
* ^(Sender|From): owner-cypherpunks@toad.com
{
  :0 BHc:
  * !? fgrep -q -i -f $HOME/.procmail/killfile.cpunks
  $MAILDIR/crypto.noflames

  .. some more irrelevant recipes ..
}

Then create ~/.procmail and edit file $HOME/.procmail/killfile.cpunks.
Put there something like

someone@you.want.to.ignore
freedom-knights
someone@else

and so on. This recipe will trash everything with the specified 
addresses mentioned in headers and bodies of incoming cypherpunks
articles. I experimented with this recipe at the height of the f-k
vs. cypherpunks flamewar. It reduced the traffic in half and what 
remained was much more useful.
