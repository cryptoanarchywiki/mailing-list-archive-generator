----------------------
Well, here's the wonderful thing about cypherpunks.  It's 
a privately run list.  There isn't freedom to flame 
wantonly, there isn't a 'right to insult'  Vulius has 
plagued this list for quite some time.  I'm glad he's 
been removed.

We return you to your regularly scheduled on-topic posts.
