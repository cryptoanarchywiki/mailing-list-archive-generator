The fact that you can start up and run your system from a CD rom proves
that you can lock your startup disk. Grab a DISK TOOLS disk from your most
recent system installer disks (mine is 7.5) and flip the write protect tab,
then start up from it. Clipboard works, too. I haven't worked with such a
system extensively enough to see if there are any glitches (such as copying
large amounts of stuff to the clipboard, etc.) but it should get the job
done for the truly paranoid.

I have a few items in the system folder presently aliased out onto other
disks - my Eudora Folder is on an encrypted partition, and there's no
reason one couldn't do this with the whole preferences folder and other
stuff.

Right. I'm proposing this as a compromise if you wish to trade security for
convenience.

Colin Plumb gave me estimates of what you needed to wipe a disk clean once,
which he researched for SFS. It depends on whether the erasure pattern is
custom designed for the data to wipe. It was something vaguely like (don't
quote me) 15 passes if custom designed, and 25 if not. This refers, as I
recall, to data freshly written to the disk. Data that hangs out for a
while 'leaks' deeper into the disk, with adjacent molecules becoming
aligned further between tracks and deeper into the disk and is harder to
erase. A dejanews search under colin's name should yield his extensive
posts on this topic.
