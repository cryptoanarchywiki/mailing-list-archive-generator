Why does it follow that these must be crackable, or the government would
have outlawed them? Despite recent moves to limit encryption, there are
currently NO domestic (U.S.) restrictions on crypto.  Nothing prohibits
you from using a true One Time Pad, which is mathematically proven to be
unbreakable, now and forever, even against infinite resources.  If this
is not prohibited (and it isn't), doesn't that refute your argument?
You may find it impossible that the masses are allowed to use truly
unbreakable crypto, but it's true -- for the time being, anyway.
