Well, unfortunately the force of your will can't change fact.  Nor can the
use of profanity or caps.

Funny, I got mine without preforming such research.
I think you better write to Harvard and Georgetown and tell them they are
in trouble.  Their requirements are nothing like this.

Ah, QED then, right?

And the Pawnee tribe must be from india cause they are called "Indians."

You claim that a J.D. and Doctorate in Law are the same degree.  I show
you a specific example which indicates otherwise, and it is irrelevant,
and off topic?

I'm cowering from the big powerful hacker with a Doctorate in Law and such
scary words.

Which is why the Pennsylvania bar decided you had to be disbared.  I see.

Good thing too or you'd be fined for practicing without a license.

You seem quite familiar with the disciplinary boards proceedures.  I think
a query for their records might be interesting.  Perhaps it would make an
entertaining post.

Clearly you were never a criminal lawyer.
