| Umm, I'm not expert, but it seems to me that the proposal removes the

	No, but they were going to lose in court anyway.  They're
losing in the marketplace, and they throw us a bone.  We don't want
bones, we want a full lifting of the restrictions.

	We want to stop wasting time on these silly fights, and start
selling things on the net.
