The biggest influence on IQ are the so-called "engrams" (fears, super-
stitions, anxieties, etc.) planted in your brain early in life.

Some of this can be overcome with mental exercise, and awareness of what
negative influences are holding you back.  Much easier said than done!

IQ as they attempt to measure it can probably be most easily explained
as pattern matching skills. Unfortunately for testing, and although you
can be every bit as intelligent at 70 as at 10, your pattern-matching
skills change and evolve over time, so any given tests will only apply
(more or less) at the age group they are optimized for.
