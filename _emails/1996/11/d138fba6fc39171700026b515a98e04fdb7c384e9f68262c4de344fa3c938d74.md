Yes, there are maany angry young men in this country.  Unions prevent
young men from compeating in the market place.  Unemployment Insurance 
artificialy increases the unemployment rate by 2% (this is a figure that
many people more knowledgable than me have stated)  welfare increases
the unemployment rate by another 1%.  The Canadian Pension Plan is
out of money and yet I am still forced to contribute and for what???
Will it still exist when I retire?  Not bloody likely.

Fortunatly NAFTA has forced some of our companies to compeat or
die.  Take a look at Canadian.  Are they gone?  I didn't get to watch the
news today......

I'll bet that most of the employees would gladly take a 10% wage cut
to save to company but the union leaders won't let them vote on it.  Why?
Because they would loose power.  Look at what the govn't do.  Most of
them just contribute to the problem by offering hand outs.  They don't
need hand outs!  ONE gov't (Alberta) offered to lower the fuel taxes.


YAAAAA RALPH!!!  (Who's ecinomic reforms incidentally (sp)  was 
hearalded by the Post as a model for govn't across North America)

Cut taxes and kill the union leaders.

Sorry for siting my sources.....
