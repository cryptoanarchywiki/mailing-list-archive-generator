Consider, however, that when computers match humans in the ability to
generate coherent sentences, they might have something useful to say.  Even
now, search, engine designers are fighting with "web spam" artists who fill
thier pages with various "key" words or statements to ensnare hapless
browsers.  These designers are developing filtering systems to combat this,
and these filters could conceivably be ported to the e-mail community to
filter machine generated text.  There should be a point where the prose spun
by asimov's "positronic brains" and that woven by a humans own "natural"
brain would be indistingushable.  At this point, we might want to hear their
opinions, for they should be as valid as any other.
