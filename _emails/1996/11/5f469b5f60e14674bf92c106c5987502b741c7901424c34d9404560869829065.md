But, what about reputation distortions?

There's the famous story about a guy presenting his discovery of the normal
distribution to a scientific society. Gauss was in the audience. He stood
up and said something like, "Oh. I figured that out years ago."

We now call it a "Gaussian" distribution, among other things.

If I remember the story correctly, Gauss never subsequently proved that he
discovered the normal distribution first, and he certainly never published
it at the time he said he discovered it.

Nobody remembers the name of the guy who was presenting the paper, though.
At least, I can't now. :-).

I'm not saying that Gauss *didn't* discover the normal distribution. I'm
saying that he didn't have to *prove* he did. Of course not. He was the
greatest mathematician of his time, and probably since.

I'd call the event a reputation distortion.

Cheers,
