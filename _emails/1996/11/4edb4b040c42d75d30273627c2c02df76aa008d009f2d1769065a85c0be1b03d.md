I used plastic ones, myself; they were good enough for any work
I was doing, even after the occasional rebuild when the [whatever you
call the clear slider with the line on it] fell off.
Started with the basic model, and later a wider log-log-trig model.
I also had a few circular ones, including a big car-rally model
that let you get an extra digit or so of precision (remember when
precision was measured in digits rather than bits? :-)

There were also a variety of nomographs and other weird slide-rules
and graphical tools that were simple analog computers.  We used some
of them in electrical engineering classes for complex calculations
that didn't need to be highly precise, which most of them didn't
in a world where the extra-fancy resistors had 5% tolerances
and you achieved accuracy by adding various tweakers instead.

ObCrypto: Secret Decoder Rings are more or less circular slide rules,
but there really isn't much crypto you can do in analog.  :-)

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
  and the politicians had to count them all.
