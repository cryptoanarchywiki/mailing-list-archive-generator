Nothing to do with crypto, of course, but at least it has something
to do with math. 

Does anyone remember Martin Gardner's April Fool's Day "Mathematical
Games" column in Sci Am in which he proposed the Banach-Tarski Paradox
as a practical method of turning a solid gold sphere into two solid
gold spheres each identical to the original?

A nice illustration of why all sets can't be measurable.
