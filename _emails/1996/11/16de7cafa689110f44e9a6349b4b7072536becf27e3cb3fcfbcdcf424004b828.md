	my point is more towards: "...here goes another direct batch of
    information directly into the federal computers --home location and
    the link between real and 'imagined' income which immediately opens
    the door for the IRS CID to start a tax-fraud investigation which
    quickly leads to liens on your property, etc. while they audit the
    living life out of you.  just one more piece, a major one at that, in
    the national databank ready to persecute you....
