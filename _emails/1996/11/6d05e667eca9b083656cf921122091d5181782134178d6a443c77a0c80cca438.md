Somebody must have said, once, that the winner in an argument is the one who 
gets to define the terms.  Notice how the term "protect" and "protection" 
are misused above. (not by Attila, of course; but by whomever he's quoting.)  

However, the term "protect" has long been misused by lawyers in just such a 
way.  "Monopolize" would be a more appropriate word under the circumstances.
