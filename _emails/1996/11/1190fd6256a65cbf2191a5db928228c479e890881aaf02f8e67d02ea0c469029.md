I was just testing out some new search software, and polled Alta Vista to
see how it all worked. I used "sex" as my search term, and Alta Vista
reported that their were "no documents matching - sex ignored"!

Interestingly enough it will let you search with other, sex-related terms
(such as "nude", "f*ck" etc), but not sex!

Very bizarre indeed.
