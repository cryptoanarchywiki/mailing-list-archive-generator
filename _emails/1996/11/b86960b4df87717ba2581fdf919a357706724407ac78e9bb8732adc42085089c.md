I seem to remember someone saying that pgp's +makerandom function was
broken.  However I'm unable to find any confirmation of this with a
web search.

I'm sure there used to be a known pgp bugs list held at MIT?  I can't
find it now.  Anyone know of the bugs lists whereabouts, or could
confirm/refute any security problems with +makerandom?

(premail uses it, pgp stealth could use it, if it worked).

[the (undocumented) feature is this:

	pgp +makerandom=1024 out

creates 1024 bytes of what should be good random nos, in file "out"]
