Just in case anyone still thinks that the ITAR doesn't interfere with the
use of cryptography to protect financial systems from fraud, here is a data
point.

 At the SET Open Vendor Meeting, MasterCard and Visa announced that a SET
 reference implementation would be made available. Unfortunately,
 producing the reference code has taken longer than we planned. Our
 current plan is to have it ready by the end of November, 1996.
 
 Because of U.S. export regulations, it will not be possible for us to
 post the reference code for download. Individuals and companies that
 want a copy of the reference code will need to request it. The
 procedures for making such a request will be announced here in
 approximately one week.
