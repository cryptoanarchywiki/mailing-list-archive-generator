Sorry for the misinterpretation. Clearly your reputation has not 
persisted in my mind with sufficent clarity since the last time I was 
involved in a cypherpunks discussion. (Or possibly this issue has 
brought together such strange bedfollows that I'm ready to believe that 
anything is possible.)

I disagree. You're assuming that you're dealing with a rational person 
who wants to be believed. It is not difficult to come up with examples 
of pure disinformation that is just "thrown out there" and never 
supported. Keep repeating the same lie, and *nonspecialists* will assume 
that there is a "debate" going on. To take an example that won't make me 
sound "politically correct," let's say the national security 
establishment tries to spread the rumor that the remailers are run by 
spooks (we've all seen the rumor; I'm not arguing and do not really 
believe that the rumor was started by spooks, but let's assume for the 
sake of argument that it was). *We* all know that this is nonsense; but 
*nonspecialists* and journalists will seize on "the controversy," and 
the perception of danger will create a real chilling effect on remailer 
use. There are still people out there who refuse to use any version of 
PGP after 2.3 because of such repeated rumors. Absolutely no one is 
trying to back them up with more complex lies; but the rumor persists.

> Maybe that's the "cancel itself out" you're talking about.

No, actually I meant that competing propaganda tends to kill itself -- 
normal people tend just to throw up their hands and say "What the hell 
does it matter anyway" -- but your interpretation is worth talking 
about, too.

No. It requires both. And sometimes, technical skill. How many people 
here know enough to evaluate the data concerning, to take a notorious 
example, the Kennedy assassination? I accept the historical consensus, 
but I know there are a lot of otherwise rational people on cypherpunks 
who are convinced that there was some sort of coverup (which sort, they 
often don't know or care; but they're conviced there was one). Oliver 
Stone got some ridiculous movie made based on this non-thesis (actually 
two, counting Nixon). People growing up today are learning pseudohistory 
and pseudoscience from Oliver Stone, "The X Files," "Dark Skies," and 
"Millenium." I find that scary. The net is better than TV, because it 
allows more responses, but I'm not sure how much better.

No, I think pure disinformation is cheaper. Period. And often, it 
doesn't have to be "believed" -- you just need to raise "suspicions" 
among nonspecialists. That is sufficent to destroy consensus and trust 
in social institutions. At the risk of sounding politically correct, how 
many nonspecialists "suspect" that the accepted history of the Holocaust 
*could* be a massive propaganda plot? (Yeah, yeah, I know the "soap 
stories" and the Polich Communists' exaggeration of the non-Jewish death 
toll at Auschwitz and all that rot, but I mean the basic facts, which 
are often denied. If you want to jump on this point, take it to 
alt.revisionism, which I read closely.) Absolutely no historians believe 
that, but lots of nonspecialists do. This doesn't mean that they believe 
it to be true; it just means that there's doubt. This kind of "doubt" is 
not the same as skepticism. Skepticism is good. Skeptical inquiry means 
you decide to take the time to investigate a story. Stubborn, cynical 
doubt, especially when based on ignorance and prejudice, is something 
else entirely.

I disagree with two of your premises. Knowing several real journalists 
(as opposed to opinion columnists), I don't consider print or broadcast 
to be particularly hierarchical. The difficulty of propagating 
disinformation depends on whether you want people to believe, or merely 
"suspect." The TWA 800 friendly-fire fiction doesn't have to be accepted 
as definitely true for it to cause trouble. The "supicion" of Richard 
Jewell doesn't have to be accepted as definitely true for it to cause 
trouble. Disinformation is more often about sowing fear, uncertainty, 
and doubt than it is about belief. Sold the right way, it can propagate 
itself; the (IMO) disinformation that the CIA is directly responsible 
for the crack-cocaine epidemic is spread by radical blacks who see it as 
a racist crime, and by radical-right conspiracy mongers who want to tie 
Clinton to the Mena story. Either way, the meme virus spreads. How many 
different kinds of groups are saying how many different groups "created" 
the AIDS virus? You don't have to "believe" that it's true for the meme 
to spread.

To some extent, but not fully. There is a certain cachet in being 
recognized as someone who uses "your real name."

Pseudonymity is only perfect where artificial boundaries such as respect 
for netiquette are erected. If someone really wanted to track you down, 
they could either find you, or "out" you as a pseudonym "afraid to use 
your own name." Both can be damaging (to your reputation or otherwise). 
In order to put your life on the line for something, you need a life 
story.
