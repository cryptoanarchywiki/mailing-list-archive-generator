Reputation is not the only reason to use a "name" with an anon remailer.
Sometimes you want to post (and have a reputation) that is entirely
seperable from your "real life" persona.  Maybe you have a job where being
involved with "The Evil Cypherpunks(tm)" could result in hastles at work
(or even firing) if known.  (I recieved flack from one company I worked
with for posting here... Until they needed a remailer set up and someone to
explain how their software worked...  But that is another story.)

Cypherpunks is gated to a number of Usenet News servers.  (Teleport is a
good example.)  It is also archived in a number of search engines.
(Altavista if I remember correctly, is one of them.)  Someone who does not
want their words to come back any byte them might just use such a method to
protect themselves.
