The answer is no.  Plenty of sites gate mailing lists to local
newsgroups, and allow open or relatively open NNTP access.  It's also
silly to assume every other person in the universe is trustworthy.

If Mr. Y sends lots of obnoxious mail to a mailing list or news group,
the proper thing to do is to put Mr. Y in your killfile and encourage
others to do so.  That way you don't get bothered by his annoying
messages, and if enough people follow suit, people stop responding to
Mr. Y's messages.  This can be even be extended to cover anonymous
posts using NoCeM-like systems.

If you try to boot Mr. Y off the mailing list using technical means,
several bad things will happen:  First of all you will fail, which
will give Mr. Y a great deal of satisfaction.  Second of all, you will
drive Mr. Y to start posting under different names, making him
considerably harder to killfile.  Third of all, you will double the
traffic on the mailing list by starting flamewars about whether this
failed booting attempt was ethical, legal, intelligent, homosexual,
scatological, or just plain useless.  Since at this point tons of
people will be replying to threads, a killfile becomes even harder to
manage.

So don't look for convoluted technical solutions to Mr. Y's
personality problems.  Just use a little basic common sense.  If you
don't like the way someone behaves on a mailing list, just ignore the
damn person.  Anything else is just going to make matters worse, as
recent history clearly demonstrates.
