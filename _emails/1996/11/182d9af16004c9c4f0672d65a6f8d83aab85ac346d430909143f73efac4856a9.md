This was my response to the excellent Telecom Regulation posting by Mr. Love.

I couldn't be more pleased that sports and greedy corporations which are
fixtures of American life are pushing for these draconian measures.  I hope
they pass with the strongest possible language and penalties and will
support same.

A broad section of the populace now takes this information for granted.
They will be outraged their elected representatives pass measures which
noticably limit their access to 'public domain' information which are part
of their daily lives.  This will serve to expose many of our elected as the
special interest puppets they are and align the common citizen with the
cypherpunks.  This, in turn, will undermine confidence in our
'unrepresentative' government and its authority.  Best of all it could lead
to populist boomerang legislation which emasculates current copyright law
and via widespread and flagrant 'civil disobedience' regarding copyright on
the Net.

I'm rubbing my hands in anticipation.
