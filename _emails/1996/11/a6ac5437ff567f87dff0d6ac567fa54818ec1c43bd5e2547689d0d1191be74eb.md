Perhaps initially, during the state of emergency declared by our heroic
and courageous President, some unfortunate abuses of authority may occur.
But, after the first 90% of the terrorists are incarcerated, we will
have the luxury of returning to an orderly legal system replete with
search warrants.

Keep in mind that the drug laws face a large number of dedicated
opponents who will go to great trouble to evade the laws.  I suspect
that these people are in the majority, although I don't know for sure.

I find it hard to believe that any sizeable number of people would
find the Four Horsemen scenario tolerable.

Sorry, I wasn't very clear.  What I mean is that once you've been
caught red handed with a stego program, the game is up.  That is, I think
it is possible to get ideas of who is operating illegally from interceptions.
(I may well be wrong.)  But, the actual evidence is easily collected
off your computer.  A program which performs encryption or stego is
not very ambiguous about what it is doing.

Under the right legal environment, and we are not far from it, none
of this matters.  The Courts can be quite liberal when they think there
is a good reason for it.  Take seating in restaurants.  If you read
the Constitution you won't find where the Federal Government is empowered
to regulate this.  The Courts decided that the Commerce Clause was
a reasonable justification.  This argument resembles the peace of God.

All the Justices have to say is that the Constitution does not specify
private speech, just public speech.  The same way it doesn't say
"assault rifle" it says "arms".  The same way it doesn't say "commercial
speech" just "speech".

The Constitution will likely be a powerful support for cryptoanarchy,
but only because I doubt widespread opposition to strong cryptography
will arise.

But we are not objecting to content!  We don't care what goes inside
the encryption - unless it involves extortion, murder, child pornography,
or weapons data - we care that communication has been limited.  Cryptography
is not a language because nobody can understand it but the recipient.
We simply want the recipient to share with the rest of the class - that
is an independent legal issue from persecution for one's beliefs which
is of course, and thankfully, unconstitutional your Honor.

Or how about this argument: It isn't the encrypted message that we
care about so much, your Honor.  We care that it is evidence that
the perpetrator did commit the illegal act of encrypting his
communications using military-grade technology which is now highly
illegal.

When I say it doesn't really put an end to most legal customs, I mean
that the courts do not have to behave all that capriciously to make
the law stick.  For the most part people know how not to break the
law and the people who are convicted did break it.  Other speech
rights do not immediately dissolve away.  Yes, there is a risk that
they will do so later, but the police state is not required to suppress
cryptoanarchy if there is strong public sentiment supporting it.

Not in the presence of wide public support.
