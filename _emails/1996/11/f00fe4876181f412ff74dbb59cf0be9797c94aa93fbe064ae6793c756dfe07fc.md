A quick note, I consider myself to be a nerd.  This is in part "reclaiming",
as I found myself uninterested in sports, as my classmates were, and found
computers fun.(good reason too, considering I had access to one of those, an
old TI99/4a, longer than I had classmates).  I didn't grow up un either log
tables or slide rules, but I did learn how to do basic arithmetic on both
the traditional slide rule, and a round one designed for engineers.  At one
time, nerds were the intellectuals, the only thing that has really changed
is that now the nerds are in control, making intellectual arts a little more
appealing.  I'm only a 21 year old college student who is still somewhat
ignorant, make that quite ignorant, about the world, but I do feel that just
because it was an unpopular term to describe you, it isn't disrespectful to
consider ourselves nerds.  Relevance to Crypto, none.  Just attempting to
defend myself in the ether.
