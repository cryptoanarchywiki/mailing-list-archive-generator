Please excuse me for my ignorance, but...

What is a "bounce attack"?  I only know of mail bouncing, and I don't see a 
way of making an "attack" out of such an occurrance...  ???

Thanks!

The postmaster of that AU site running the bounce attack
assures me he has been able to vanquish the daemon running
the box in question; despite the fact he did not even know it was
there ;-} [Don't ask..]
