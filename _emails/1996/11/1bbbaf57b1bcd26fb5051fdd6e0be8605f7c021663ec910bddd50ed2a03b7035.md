Don't forget that the likely cause of the 1917 world-wide influenza pandemic 
was probably caused or greatly increased in seriousness by the WWI movement 
of soldiers, and the conditions at the front.    Had there been no war, 
there might still have been a very localized outbreak, but it would have 
been much less serious.

The estimate of 170 million seems a bit high, but not by much.
