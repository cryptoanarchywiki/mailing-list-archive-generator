As Hal knows, but some newer members of the list may not, I discuss the
possibility of a ban on strong (unescrowed) crypto at some, ahem, length
in

http://www.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/articles/clipper.htm

Although the article is more than 18 months old, the law hasn't changed
in any material way as far as I know.

Bottom line: they probably can't do it under the constitution, but it's a
closer call than it should be.
