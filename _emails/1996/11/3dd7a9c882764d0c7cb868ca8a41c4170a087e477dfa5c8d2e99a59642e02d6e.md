  Well China is nor more of an example of communism than Argentina
is of Capitalism--they are both totalitarim regimes that use ideology
as an excuse to plunder.  It would be unfair for example to use
Marcos wife (and her shoe collection) as an example of why 
capitalism doesn't work.

  Perhaps by some--not most.  Many die without wills--the wealthy
tend to be much more careful with such things of course but you could
allow provisions to have a percentage donated to non-political chartible 
organizations.

  I sincerely don't believe that.  If you look at your above
examples, or Bill Gates below, much of their motivation is not
the accumulation of weath per se but rather power and performance.
I know I would do much the same job (not that I'm in the wealthy)
even if the salary were more or less--I enjoy it (I'm a programmer).
Same is true for education--much of the motivation is either 
intrinsic or status oriented and has little or nothing to do with
marketablity.

  Not at all--no more or less so than in capatilistic societies.

  That's true--as with all labor--but it is a matter of scale.  
Gates would do the same thing if you limited his income just
for the sake of power accumulation--he's got all the money
he could ever consume.  That's not his real motive.

  Yes-our auto industry is a disgrace and I agree we do no favors
protecting them or bailing them out.  On the other hand goverment 
must protect against the creation of business monopoly which is
even more stifling.

   Sorry to chop out so much about Microsoft--but sure most wealth is
transferred in this country--that's a statisitical fact.  Yes--there
is consumption but when accumalation gets into the multi-millions that
becomes irrelevant--money grows as you know--stocks, property, etc. and
that is all that is passed down.  There are few on either of these mailing
lists that if given 10 million dollars could not sit on their ass for
the rest of their lives consuming comfortably and watch their money double
by the time they pass away.

simple 100% inheritance tax would be very helpful as would limitations
on how much property a given individual (and a corporation is a virutal
individual) may own.

  Well the original issue we were discussing was the fact that
a majority of wealth in the US in not earned--it is inherited.  That
can be changed very quickly with proper legislation.

  As to your other issue here--earnings and limitations on accumulation,
much would be equalized without inheritance.  But yes--there would
still be accumulators--most would still produce regardless of
limits because as I said their motives are not simply income--power,
prestige, etc. all come in to play as well as the gratification that
comes with winning.  Gates enjoys his cover on Time Mag. much more
than a few extra million a day.

  But the basic answer to your argument--from my standpoint--is that
some people are extremely intellegent, others very gifted in other
ways, others very dull witted, etc.  Some possess artistic genius
that can pay off immediately, others have none that is valued dollar
wise by society.  I sincerly don't believe one has the right to
live better than the other--that the rewards, if different, sould
be negligable.  

  If I could make as much as I do know programming by working as
a clerk in a convenience store or whatever I would still choose to
do what I am doing.  If you are in a different situation you're
in the wrong career.

                            Steve
