We often say that the government is a security weak point and that
this makes GAK impractical.  However, this is not true.  If the
holders of the government keys were individually responsible for
their release, they would not be released very often.  That is,
in order to use cryptography you must purchase an expensive
encryption license.  That pays the salary of a certified "key
escrow agent" who is the only person who can decrypt your messages.
What stops him from revealing your keys to unauthorized parties?
It's his business.  If that's not enough, you back it up with
criminal penalties for disclosure.  And, hiring this person is
no different from hiring an employee for your company.

There are already similar activities.  Lawyers are nominally employees
of the state.  Employees of Swiss banks can go to jail for violating
their secrecy laws.

I agree, if the software is popular.  But, if the fears of the GAKers
and the dreams of certain cypherpunks are real, such software will
not be popular.
