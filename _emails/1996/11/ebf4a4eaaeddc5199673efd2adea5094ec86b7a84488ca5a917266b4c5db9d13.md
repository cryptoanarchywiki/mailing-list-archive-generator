This betrays your ignorance.  I.Q. is scaled according to age.  One does
not "improve."

Incorrect.

One can obtain a Doctorate in Law, (As in Dr.) but it is generally a
pointless endeavor except in some civil law jurisdictions.  (Liechtenstein
is a good example, where many attornies have a Dr.Iur. (Dr.) while others
merely have a Lic.Iur. (J.D.) ).

A J.D. requires no dissertation.
A Doctorate in Law does.

I submit you know too little about any of these to have attained either
one.

Incorrect.

A J.D. is not a true Doctorate, and even if it were, it would not be the
only current valid "Doctorate" that you can "do" in "plain Law."

Georgetown, as an example, offers a Doctorate in Law degree which requires
a J.D., an LL.M. and three years of legal teaching experience simply to
qualify for the program.

A Doctor of Judicial Science program is also available with many of the
same requirements.

Both programs require a dissertation and a defense of same.

San Marcos University is also known for an exceptional Doctor of Laws
program.

Incidently, LL.D.s are rare and generally useful only in European circles.

As usual, you have overextended your bounds and now find yourself swimming
in water over your head.

Actually, they are not.  Unauthorized access of a computer system is a
crime.  Anyone who had a "doctorate" in law would know this.

I doubt your reference to mercenaries was merely a threat to my system,
but keep pushing if you like.

Which law school?  And did you do a dissertation?  What is its title?  Do
you practice?  What state are you licensed in?

Ok, do it.  We'll see.

I suggest a hobby which entails more physical activity.
