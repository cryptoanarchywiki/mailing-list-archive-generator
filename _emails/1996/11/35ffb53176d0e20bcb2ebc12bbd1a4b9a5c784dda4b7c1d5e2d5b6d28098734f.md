Hey, that "stuff" comes in useful.

Some of the more origional ones are posted on my office wall,
so when people accuse me of being a childish, insensitive and
 egotistical  I just show them some cypherpunk postings, "See, I'm not
this bad, count yourself fortunate how would you like to work for some
of these guys?"

Conceptual, I had the same idea about a year ago, but never enough
time to do it. Practically, it could be painful.

It's possible to have a key-server listen on a port and accept
requests, then it would
fork a process, process the result, and return an answer set.

But how many CPU cycles would it take for a machine to process a
request, ie going through
1000 of keys?  I am not exactly sure, it took a long while on my
pentium.

In my opinion, if I were to run a key server as a service, with
clients connecting and requesting a key
it shouldn't take more than a minute to get a responce.

Had the exact same idea, but came up with an interesting concept. When
a person submits a key, a PGP process is spawned yeilding the
following information 1.) The name (peponmc@cris.com) 2.) The real
name (Michael Peponis) 3.) The key size 4.) Creation date of the key
5.) Key finger print

This information, along with the acutal key would be inserted into a
SQL Database table

With a structure similar to this

Name           varchar2
Real_name   Varchar2
KeySize        Integer
CreationDate date
PGPKEY       Varchar(a fairly large one)
Submission_date  Date

The idea here being that the key would be added as a field, and
requests from clients
and other key servers would do a simple Database query, which are very
quick.

It's not that hard, it's performance that's more of an issue.  The
beauty of my approch would be that initially, there would be alot of
"Add" requests, resulting in many PGP processes running on the box,
but eventually, they would tapper off.

Database requests pose no real problems, on Unix boxes, especially
with Oracle, the SGA is always running, it's just one more request,
going up against a realatively small table.  The box could return an
answer in a matter of seconds, as opposed to over a two minutes.

Server updates would be swift too, they would just transfer well
defined SQL Datasets between themselves.

Let me know what you think of my idea
