I think you might be missing the very succinct and subtle point that 
all you ever contributed to this list (despite your knowledge of 
cryptography) was rants about sovok jews and Tim Mays sexual 
orientation. I happen to be knowledgable about cryptography but even 
if I`m not an expert I do tend to post things that are of value and 
interest as opposed to worthless flames.
