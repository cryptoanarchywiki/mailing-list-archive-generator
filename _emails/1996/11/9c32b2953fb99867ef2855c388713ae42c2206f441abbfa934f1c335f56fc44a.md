Greetings!

The Linux IPSP implementation I have been working on lately is finally at a 
stage where it can benefit from feedback, and also where other may also 
benefit from it. This is NOT an untar-and-play release; far from it. It is 
being made available so that it can reach the UnP stage faster than if only I 
work on it.

The code compiles into a loadable module for the 2.0.xx (I'm running 2.0.24) 
kernel. Use at your own risk. I won't be held responsible even if it mails the 
contents of your filesystems to the NSA and the KGB (or whatever), and then 
proceeds to encrypt them :-)

The gzip-ed tar file is in:

	http://prometheus.hol.gr/~ji/ipsec-0.2.tar.gz

If you want to mirror it to your ftp site, please drop me a note. 

Enjoy!

/ji
