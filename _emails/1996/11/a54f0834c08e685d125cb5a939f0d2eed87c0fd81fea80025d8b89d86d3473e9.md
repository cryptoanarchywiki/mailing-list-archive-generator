Personal and business references that you can check out are a good start, but beware
of expecting much from org's such as BBB, etc.  The reasons are twofold:

1. Most org's today are (despite the fact that they have computers on their desks)
   extremely shy about picking sides in computer software business matters, because,

2. Unlike nearly any other business, software development/implementation is not
   predictable in many situations like house or bridge building.  Costs and hours
   may run many times what was estimated, unless the up-front estimate was so
   exhaustive (paid for, huh?) that it could be relied on as usably accurate.

   The fact is, the more cookie-cutter the project is, the more likely it will meet
   estimates.  Unfortunately, most customers don't want cookie-cutter for a number
   of reasons, one being the reluctance to pay for old (tried and true) technology.

Another qualified OK - you may be able to identify the weasels all right, but if you
expect the "good guys" to absorb all cost overruns for way-inaccurate estimates, well,
maybe they will on the phase of the project that they have a solid committment to,
but then they'll still leave you with a dead end product if it costs them way too much,
and they'll do it legally, and they won't need you as a reference anyway, since they
will have other satisfied customers.  And with all this, it still comes down to the
fact that a comprehensive, thorough, and accurate estimate on a significant computer
project is either impossible, or it'll cost way more than a customer will want to
pay for.  You already know if you've been to court that telling the "honest truth"
will not get you the best result many times, so it shouldn't surprise anyone that
these kinds of projects would not bring out the most honest side of people.
