Just a thought:  You remember that Uncle Dave (Packard, now deceased) was
the assistant Sec. of Defense, etc.  Don't think for a minute Lew Platt
and his boys don't have this one in the bag.

I once asked a couple of their PR engineers (they used to have those) if
HP would ever release (for example) the internals of their 1MB1 Capricorn
chip, which ran at 0.6 mhz (that's 640 khz!), and their answer as best I
remember was words and gestures to the effect of "no f______ way".

HP knows what's breakable and what's not, unlike you and me, and you just
know they're not going to put anything *really* important out there where
Bill and Hillary can get their paws on it.  Seems to me it's a matter of
who are you gonna line up with when the shit comes down, so to speak.
