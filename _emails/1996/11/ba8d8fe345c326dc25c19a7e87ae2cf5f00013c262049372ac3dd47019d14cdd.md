It should not surprise you too much, as people have often vilified those they
disagree with. 
 
The more you accept the other person as a human being, the more difficult it
becomes to dismiss their view without first confronting the issues. It's easier
to treat them as an idiot, and then their views becomes idiotic by association.

I know all this, and still I do it.

Ciao,
James
