Tell ya' what, Mr. know-it-all.  From 1983 to 1988, I developed my own database program
and ported it to 7 different small-computer O/S's.  Much of the re-porting for updates
I handled with custom utilities I developed for the purpose.

I wouldn't claim to have expertise equal to some of those whizzes from IBM et al, but I
sure as hell know what it is to make code *very* portable.

Problem with PGP (apparently) is multiple sources (programmers) and just a helluva big
size for what it does (for most people).  Now, Win95, WinNT, etc. are also big for
what most people will use them for, but then again, those programs will *never* be
issued with source, and anyway, you don't have to bet the farm on their security.
