I think this is true.  Good computer security, including encryption,
is clearly important to the financial well being of the country.
If we consider that to be a national security issue, then we have
to ask why the national security apparatus is attempting to undermine
our security.

But if the doomsayers are right, this would not be the case.  Most
people will be willing to give up some Internet commerce if they believe
it is necessary to protect their children and maybe their society.
That is not even an unreasonable point of view.

I may be mistaken.  I have added "Disappearing Cryptography" to my list.
Still, my intuition says that it is quite hard to do stegonography for
many years and never tip your hand even once.

But you really don't need to prove it.  You just have to convince a judge
to issue a warrant for you to get the real evidence.  If you have to,
you'll train a dog to sniff stego.  (That was a joke by the way. ;-)

Are you concatenating these images by hand?  If so, the level of entropy
is probably low enough to recover the information through brute force
methods or you are hiding a very small amount of information.

If you are not doing it by hand, you own terrorist software and will pay
the price.

And, by the way, who are these friends?  Can any of them finger you in
exchange for a reduced sentence?

Incidentally, I hope nobody on this list believes they will be able
to practice cryptoanarchy in my scenario.  You are already suspects.

In the Four Horsemen scenario, where people are being murdered all the
time and the society is in a turmoil, popular support for the suppression
of strong cryptography would be easy to arrange.

In the Four Horsemen scenario, it is likely that most engineers would

This is correct.  But these views would be change if we were facing
a terrible situation.  It isn't even clear that you would have to
tamper with free speech rights all that much to suppress strong
cryptography.  There would be a dramatic political risk that all rights
would disappear later, but after somebody you know gets killed
anonymously, you might be willing to chance it.
