He might as well - he's got zero credibility. Let him soak in the hot
tub with all the Cygnus Support employees, whose biggest qualification

newsgroup, so he could stay in "control"?

> We want John Gilmore to respond to this censorous matter on the net.

He tried to keep his censorship secret, but he's been forced to talk about it.
In fact, he called his shameful actions "an act of leadership". He sounds
