For absolute brain candy, I recommend "Star Smashers of the Galaxy
Rangers".  EE.Doc Smith meets the Hardy Boys.  The ending I had to read
twice...

The bandwidth will increase and people will find bigger and better ways to
chew it up.  Governments will make bigger and bigger claims to why their
set of petty rule outweigh other governemnts petty rules, increasing fear,
uncertanty and doubt in the process.  All in all, things will change and
life will go on.  (Unless we all die and then all bets are off.)

Mmmm!  Bandwidth!

I hear of people complaining how much time is spent online.  This is going
to be a heroin-like fix to those sort of people.  (I already have access to
a t-1.  It can be pretty damn addicting.  At least when the rest of the net
is willing to cooperate...)  I expect that the big winners in the bandwidth
wars will be the hard drive manufacturers.  Imagine the amount of crap that
will accumulate when downloads take seconds instead on minutes (or hours).
Buy your stock now!

Actually the future was last week.  Sorry.  You missed it.
