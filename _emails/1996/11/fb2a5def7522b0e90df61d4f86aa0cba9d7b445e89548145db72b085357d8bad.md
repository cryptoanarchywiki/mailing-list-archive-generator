For all interested and Swedish-speaking (sorry...) list members:

I have just completed my graduation thesis in law at the University of
Stockholm. The title of the paper is "Elektroniska betalningssystem -
Teknisk säkerhet och juridisk osäkerhet" (eng. Electronic Payment Systems -
Technological Security and Legal Uncertainty"), and is available at

http://www.users.wineasy.se/gustavw

where you will find the ToC in HTML and the complete paper in pdf-format
(about 230K).
If there is sufficient interest, I might consider translating the paper, or
parts of it, into English. The legal bits are specifically about Swedish
Law, though, so I'm not sure how useful they would be for
non-Scandinavians.

Any comments or suggestions are greatly welcome and can be sent to
gustavw@wineasy.se.


BTW: Bob, thanks for a great list - I couldn't have done it without you...
Cheers!

BR,

Gustav WInberg
