Yes, many calculators still have the add/multiply error also.  Most of the
newer generation (the one which I wish I didn't have to be a part of)
doesn't know what RPN is, much less how to use it.

A friend of mine found his father's RPN HP (don't know which model) from
college a week or two ago, and you'd never beleive how long it took me to
convince him that "RPN" really does stand for "Reverse Polish Notation".
As for slide rules, I think I'm the only person at my school who knows
what a slide rule _is_, much less how to use one ;)
