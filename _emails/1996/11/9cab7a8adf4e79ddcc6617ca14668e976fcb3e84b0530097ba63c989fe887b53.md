The serial number is derived from the time of day.  This is used by a lot of
programs to get a few bits of entropy, so the disk serial number will probably
not add much entropy.  Here's a post I saved from alt.hackers that explains the
exact algorithm:

        It's not a pesudo-randum number #, it actually has a formula.  It's
based on the current date & time.

unsigned long int NS;  (Serial numbers are 32 bits)

NS = (  ( ( ((seconds << 8) + hundreth) ) +
            ((day << 8) + month) ) << 16 ) +
       (   ((hour << 8) + minutes) + year);

        Try this: get a disk that is already formatted (but whose data you
don't care about:)

>FORMAT A:/Q/U/V:""

        Format the disk once, note the serial number, then immediately
format it again.  Note that the second serial number only differs in
a few digits from the first.
