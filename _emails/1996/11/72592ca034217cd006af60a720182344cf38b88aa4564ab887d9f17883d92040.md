Obviously many voluntary religious organizations have quite strict rules
for their members and are compatible with libertarianism.  Government
monopoly regulations that cannot be opted out of are not compatible with
libertarianism.  Instead of using the loaded term "regulations' it might be
better to call things like the rules of the cypherpunk's list "club rules"
or protocols.
