And this, my friends, is a perfect example of the goofy results
of the doctrine of Political Correctness.  My comment was not a 
reference to race, but rather an allusion to an old joke, to wit:

		The Lone Ranger and his faithful side-kick,
		Tonto, are trapped in a box canyon by an 
		attaching war party of Apache Indians.  
		The Lone Ranger, sensing defeat, says, "Well 
		Tonto, it looks like we are doomed."
	
		To which Tonto replies, "What you mean WE,
		white man?"

(For the record, I'm mostly Caucasian.)
