	all the remailers I know strip the headers except the subject. 

	If you put another header type line in the body of the text, it
    will still be there --in the body which means your filter does a great
    number of CPU cylces unnecessary.  Suggest: 

	    Subject: [aga@] whatever the current smoke....

    which should pass most of the garden variety remailers. 

	Personally, I think he's so far out, he is almost more humouress
    than he is ignorant, but he's been procmailed....
