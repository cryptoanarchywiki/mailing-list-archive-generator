Yeah, I knew I used a bad choice of words.  I meant global as in "all-
encompassing" rather than the geographical definition.

Oops.  I forgot.  :-)  I guess this idea would work.  But, there would be a
very large price for anonymity - two mailers holding their hands out for a 
piece of the pie.

Well, I must admit you seem to have this idea pretty well thought out, and 
it just may work.  The hardest part of the plan would probably be gaining
acceptance.  True, everyone loves getting a check, especially if all they
had to do was open and close email to have it register as being read, but
the hard part is getting people to accept having to pay to send someone a
message.  Of course, there's the argument that currently we pay for stamps...
:-)
