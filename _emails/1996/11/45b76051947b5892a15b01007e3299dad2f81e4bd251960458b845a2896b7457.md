I should probably make it more clear that my comment referred to price, NOT
quality.  I'm sure it is a wonderful product (I haven't tried it myself),
but I believe the price tag was at or around $1000.  My comments on the 
hardware used was for demostration purposes, not for saying anything was
wrong with the design strategy.  In fact, I thought it was a perfectly fine
strategy, and easy(ish) to implement.  Basically, it took the dedicated
computer you would need for phone encryption and put it in a cheaper box.

To be honest, I thought he had a good idea.  I just wouldn't want to pay
$1000 for phone encryption.  But, it's rare I have conversations where I
need that much security.  I'm sure the product is worth it; it's just out
of my price range.  And probably out of the price range of the average user.
