and network administrators.  The meetings are free and open to the public.

BayLISA holds monthly meetings on the third Thursday of each month at
7:30 PM PST.  We meet at Cisco building J in San Jose, on Tasman Drive near
First street. (This is across the street from the room we met in at Cisco last
month). See www.baylisa.org for more information.  The meetings are also
broadcast via MBONE.

NOTE:  AS OF OCTOBER, WE HAVE MOVED TO CISCO.  This is a new location. Thanks

Randal Schwartz: Just Another Convicted Perl Hacker

This talk will describe how the speaker became a felon in the
process of doing his job as a systems administrator in the
well-publicized Oregon v. Schwartz case (victim: Intel).  It will
include some points about Oregon's current law and the implications
of this case on the computer community.  There will be a special
focus on how to make sure this doesn't happen to you.

There will be copies of Randal's new PERL book available if you would like to
get one signed.
