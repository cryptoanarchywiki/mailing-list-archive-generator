You are correct other than for the fact that we have posted the
algorithm:

       http://www.netprivacy.com


And we have proven that it is unbreakable, as most of you are aware. Just 
look at the algorithm and you will understand why! It is self evident as
proven by Shannon. 

Also, there is no "s" in my last name, it is Wood, though call me
anything that you like. 

Also, as far as Perry not responding to me, he does but not on the
Cypherpunks list anymore. The other list is not personal, so we correspond
in private,

With kindest regards,

Don Wood
