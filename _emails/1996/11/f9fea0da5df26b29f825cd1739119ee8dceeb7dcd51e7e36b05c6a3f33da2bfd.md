Perhaps it would be feasible to provide in each hop of the reply
block, a second address to send errors to.  This could be a newsgroup
(alt.anonymous.messages), and a key to encrypt the error message with.
Looking at a.a.m now and then would then be sufficient to check on the
status of your reply blocks.

Bouncing messages to your own reply block to `ping' it, is another
way.

I'd like to see ways to have reply blocks which are more resilient to
single remailer failures, both transient failures, and remailers
decomissioning without warning.  My thoughts so far are that it may be
possible to acheive these goals by having a reply block secret split
across remailers, so that the chosen proportion, k of n remailers are
sufficent for your reply to get through.

Perhaps you may to prefer to think about it in terms Harry Browne's
campaign slogans, about reducing government to 10% (or whatever).
It's not that easy to get rid of government all at once, and you'll
get to see how having less government works out in practice, as it is
shrinking.  You've got to admit government is too big, at least!
