The military's sole purpose is to destroy things and kill people.
Freedom is protected by the poeple for the people some of which
are in the military.  The force is not nessasary to enforce laws in
most circumstances.  How many gun battles erupt at speed traps?  Granted,
there are instances where some force is required in arresting violent 
individuals, but it is still illeagal for the police to use ecessive
force.

You are wrong about bad laws being enforced.  Many laws are not enforeced
by the police.  Have you never been "let off" or "givin a warning" by the
police?  How many times have you seen people j walk in front of the police
who did nothing?

Computers are not nessasary to encode data, they just make it a lot
eaiser and faster.  Where did I put that secret decoder ring????
