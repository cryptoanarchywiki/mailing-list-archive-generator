While your potential market is small, it is dedicated.  Developers of 
crypto products are always looking for good random sources.  People 
that really NEED more reliable sources of random bits are willing to 
pay for them.  I dont think your market will be end users.  But a 
little market research should turn up a healthy margin for you.

Why would you hash good RNG output?  I understand your desire to 
deter hardware only attacks.  I just think it might be an 
overreaction.  Of course mine could be an under-reaction 8-)

It would have to go through rigorous testing in the crypto community. 
 RNGs v. PRNGs goes through a yearly debate here on cpunks.  There 
have been some good discussions on the use of white noise and other 
potential hardware sources.  Im not sure if hks is back up or not, 
but you might look there.

If an independant entity could certify the product with a good 
reputation for dedication to the community, you would get much 
milage.  PGP, Inc. might be interested for instance.  I mean I have 
used PGP for years but have not had the time to go through the code, 
etc.  I trust it because Phil's reputation precedes him.

Go for it Jim.  I would be happy to support you in any way I could.  
Let me know.  It sounds like a good idea.
