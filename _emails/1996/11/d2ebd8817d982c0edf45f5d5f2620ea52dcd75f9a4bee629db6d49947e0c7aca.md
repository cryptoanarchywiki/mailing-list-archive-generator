The above is a true statement.  Note however that "congress" cannot
operate the mint.  It must -- **MUST** -- delegate this duty to the
executive branch (or someone outside the legislative branch, cf. Chadha
v. U.S.) if it wants it done. Congress is free to select the type
of agent it wants to do this.  Indeed, if Congress chose to license
private mints, that would, IMHO be legal.  The point here is that the
states don't have the power to coin money.

The above is so oversimplified as to be meaningless; anyway it's almost
certainly (mostly) wrong. It refers to a case that has never been followed
since.  There are many cases since that supply the necessary context.  I
discuss some of them in my article.  I discuss others in my student note
and in other articles availble from my homepage.

Bah. "Mere legallity" indeed.

No.  Unless by "effectively" you mean "during periods of inflation".  But
the currency can deflate too... e.g. in a depression.

No, I'm afraid you are making the common but incorrect assumption that
reading some part of one court case from the dustbin of history out of
context makes you a constitutional expert.

You may feel differently as I get grumpier...
