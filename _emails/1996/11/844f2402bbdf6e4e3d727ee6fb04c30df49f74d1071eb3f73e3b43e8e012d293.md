  Should a database protection law such as HT 3531 be enacted in the U.S.,
it just may turn out to be the best weapon yet for the protection of
personal data.  Why shouldn't a "database" be interpreted to include an
individual's personal data?  All that is required is that it be "arranged in
a systematic or methodical way".  Heck, that's not so hard.  And a "database
maker" isn't necessarily Lexis (the compiler of P-TRAK) and friends, it is
each individual who originally made a "substantive" (i.e., lifetime)
investment in the collection of the contents of his personal database.

  Based on this reasoning, P-TRAK, etc. would be considered an infringing
use, subject to civil and possible criminal actions, injunctions,
impoundment, and monetary relief.  Hmmm...
