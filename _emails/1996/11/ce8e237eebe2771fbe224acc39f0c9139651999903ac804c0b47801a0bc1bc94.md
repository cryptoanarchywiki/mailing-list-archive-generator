[mucho snippo]

The danger in conspiracy theories (and you can check the L.A. Times for
verification of this) is that they are often tied in to anti-Semitism
and other forms of racism, and/or provide an excuse to....

The fact is, though, that only government possesses the power to ruin the
lives of masses of people, which they have often done, even in this century.
Anyone who says "the conspiracies aren't true" and "anti-government rhetoric
is automatically bad", etc. is just sticking their head in the sand.

The militias are a necessary correction to government excess, however
negative the implications of militia power might be.

As far as the difficulty in creating the infrastructure to monitor every-
one, well, it exists and is growing by the minute.  All "they" have to do
is listen in, and have smart programs to sort out what they want to look
at (which they certainly do).  Think of it as a percentage deal.  The
people the govt. most want to monitor are the ones who are the most
active in their travel and communication, therefore, it greatly reduces
the monitoring load.
