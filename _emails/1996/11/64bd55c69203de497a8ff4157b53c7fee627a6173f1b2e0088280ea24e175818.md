Not at all, and I think you could make some interesting equations out of
this if you wanted to spend the time.

Factors for raw intelligence, i.e., pattern matching skills.
Factors for aggressiveness, assertiveness, self-confidence, etc.
Factors for manipulative ability (to manipulate people, etc.).  I don't
know how to properly categorize this last item, but perhaps a professional
psychologist would.

In sum, I think you could observe successful people and establish most
of the relevant factors, but be aware - if you are not an insider in
several of these "success circles", you might miss one or more key
factors, particularly those that would be denied by successful people,
such as willingness to do things people don't like to talk about openly.
