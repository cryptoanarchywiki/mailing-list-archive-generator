I believe x is around 2, but it's a rather tortured argument to call 
that "government killing its own people." You had at least two 
governments going at it.

I've heard Farrakhan claim 500 million, but 100 million due to slavery 
and related colonialism seems credible. I also would not call this 
"governments killing their own people." For the most part, it was 
private enterprise. Slave traders were not exactly the cream of the 
intellectual elite.

The only conceivable connection to "governments killing their own 
people" I can think of is that railroad tycoon Leland Stanford was also 
a Senator at one point.

I'd have to ask John Morris on that.

My. What a charmer you are. Please share these insights with the 
alt.revisionism crowd at your earliest convenience.

The 30 million figure comes from Robert Conquest, who worked for the 
British government writing anti-Soviet propaganda during and after the 
war. Nobody has ever accused him of underestimating Soviet 
atrocities. But playing rhetorical games with numbers of this magnitude 
is unseemly. I'll leave that to you guys. Suffice to say that Stalin was 
a monster, and Lenin was the same; there are scans of execution orders 
in Stalin's and Lenin's handwriting at 
http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/soviet.exhibit/collect.html

Actually, the Cultural Revolution mostly enslaved people, rather than 
killing them. To get to 65 million you'd have to include the 
revolutionary and collectivization periods.

Right. The Conspiracy touches everything. Even that authoritative 
historical journal the Guiness Book of Records.
