Well, I was speaking mathematicly (sortof).  When I say "unbreakable", I
mean that you can't figure out the plaintext given only the cyphertext.
In this sence, you can't prove an algorithm "unbreakable", for the reasons
stated *so many times* on this list, and OTP is very very breakable, but
the information you get after breaking it isn't usefull to you.
