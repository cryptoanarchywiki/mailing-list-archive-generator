----------

   "Techno-Hero or Public Enemy?"

   James Bidzos of RSA Data Security wants to go global
   with a potent shield against computer break-ins. Uncle
   Sam's most secretive spy agency wants to stop him. At
   stake is the right to privacy and the health of the
   U.S. software industry.
