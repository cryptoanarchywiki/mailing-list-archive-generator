Why the quotes? John Gilmore censored me with no quotes.

No. John Gilmore's actions are contrary to free speech, but his own
principles clearly don't include free speech. He has no credibility.

Not true. An honorable person would tolerate all speech and either ignore
it or respond with more speech. A dishonorable person, such as John Gilmore,
seeks to silence the speech he doesn't like.

Funny you should mention manners. Censorship is rude. John Gilmore's plug-
pulling has got to be one of the rudest acts ever perpetrated on this
mailing list. Note also that he hasn't pulled the plugs of other very
rude people, like Timmy May (fart).

Speech is not action. Action is not speech.

I don't think John Gilmore's sexual practices are *that* bizarre. The Kinsey
report estimates that 10% of the population shares his practices.
