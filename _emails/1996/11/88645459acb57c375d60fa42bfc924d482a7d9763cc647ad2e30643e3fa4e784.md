That is a bound on a _reliable_ algorithm.  A faster one is to shuffle
the elements and present it as sorted.  Lightning fast, but only with
low probability of correctness.  That is what we are up against in a key
search attack.  The other guy just might guess my 100 bit key first time,
millionth time or whatever - early enough anyway.

So to get a lower bound you have to show that a lucky guess cannot be
distinguished from an unlucky one - and if you do that without a one
time pad I take my hat off.
