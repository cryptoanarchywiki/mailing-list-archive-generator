But I wasn't talking about evidence in court, ALL I was talking about
was personal privacy in a (wasted) reply to aga's assertion that only
criminals would want to use PGP for email. I made the simple observation
that I think it is reasonable for me to not want others to read personal
(e)mail, period. Nothing about courts, law, free speech or anything
else. That was aga's straw-man, not mine.

On the contrary, nothing and nobody has stopped me (or you apparently) 
from speaking openly and freely. You are just being silly.

I didn't even say I opposed anonymity, I just find it distasteful.

Well, in case you missed it, I was simply having fun with the word
`safe'. As I do not do things illegal and there is nothing in my
encrypted or non-encrypted mail that would get me into trouble, it is of
course perfectly `safe' even if the encryption were broken. Much more
than adequate for the `envelope' that I want it for.

Blah blah blah, this is your argument not mine. I won't help you here.

cheers, kinch
