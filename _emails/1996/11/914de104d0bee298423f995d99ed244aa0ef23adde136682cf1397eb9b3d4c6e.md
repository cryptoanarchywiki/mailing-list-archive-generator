More to the point, it is the use of constructs such as state machines to 
handle event processing that make it easy to compromise code - even 
without the magic of "hidden" DLL's or trap calls.

The Wintel PC is a virtual treasure trove of opportunity to 
compromise; starting with the BIOS, Boot sector, interrupt handlers and 
winding up with trojan horse applications and colorful file system viruses 
such as Windows. Unfortunately, UNIX on Intel is not immune to low level 
compromises either.
