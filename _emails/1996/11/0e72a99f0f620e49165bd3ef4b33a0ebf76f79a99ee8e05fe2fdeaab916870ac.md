Whitehouse Releases Blueprint For Major Net Issues Concerning Government 
And Commerce 
By Will Rodger 
November 27, 1996 02:35:13 PM EST
Inter@ctive Week Online 

The White House will release a blueprint for the governance of personal 
and business transactions over the Internet early next week that 
drafters and industry alike say marks a turning point in the Clinton 
administration's approach to cyberspace.

The document, a product of an 18-agency working group headed by 
presidential Senior Adviser Ira Magaziner, covers every cyberspace major 
issue before governments and Internet users worldwide. Though in many 
ways it is a restatement of approaches already suggested elsewhere, the 
document urges a shift towards free market forces on the Net and a 
rejection of government interference in electronic commerce.

The blueprint also represents the first time the administration has 
issued unambiguous policy statements regarding tariffs, censorship on 
the Internet and establishment of a body of international law for 
commerce.
