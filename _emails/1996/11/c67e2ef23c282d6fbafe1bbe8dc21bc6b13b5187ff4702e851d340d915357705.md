Right.  But if you're doing SSL, you _have_ to know about the
export issues!  It's all over the sources, specs, docs etc etc.
It's almost implssible to be 'clueless' about this if you
have implemented SSL or even looked seriously at doing it.

So if their point is to fight against ITAR (one interpretation of
the facts as I know them) why haven't they announced that they're doing so?
It would be good PR.

That'd be cool.  I think that there's a lot that we don't know about this.

The web site doesn't have much hard info, just a lot of
buzzword-compliant marketing bullstuff and the highest ratio of
(TM)s to words that I have ever seen.
