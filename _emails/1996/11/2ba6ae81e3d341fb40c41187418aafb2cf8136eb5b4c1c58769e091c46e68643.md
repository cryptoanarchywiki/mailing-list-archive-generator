When I was in high school, slide rules and log tables were standard
equipment - calculators started to come in towards the end. There
was a *lot* of controversy over their use in exams, and in homework
('show your working...'). At one point, you could use a calculator, but
only if you noted the fact (and model) on your exam paper.

I had a couple of nice 12-inch plastic slide rules - the better one, with
about 20 scales and double sides was stolen while I was in college.

I still treasure one of the heirlooms from my grandfather - a 12
inch bamboo rule, with his name carefully engraved in engineering
lettering ( which he used during his 50+ years at Ma Bell).

Not long ago I visited the MIT Museum, and in the shop found for
sale 'new' (circa 1975) plastic slide rules, both straight and circular.
I got one of each for old time's sake, and am thinking of having one
framed with a 'break glass in case of emergency' sign.
