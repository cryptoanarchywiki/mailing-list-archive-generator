You really need to get your facts straight.  Vulis is _not_ prevented from
posting under his name to cpunks.  He has in fact made several posts since
he was removed from the list.  My question still stands.  Why is this editorial
control?  None of the cases you cited were anything like this situation.

Call it what ever you want, it's still government regulation to tell someone
how to run a mailing list.  The first amendment says nothing about any of this
"common carrier" nonsense.  This is just the Supreme Court's interpretation.
If you are so concerned about being "censored", why don't you just ask the list
owner to clearly state his position about subscriptions and submissions
before subscribing?  It's not right to expect someone providing a service free
of charge to accept the burden of making sure his position on subscription and
submissions are stated clearly just because you're too lazy to find out
yourself.
