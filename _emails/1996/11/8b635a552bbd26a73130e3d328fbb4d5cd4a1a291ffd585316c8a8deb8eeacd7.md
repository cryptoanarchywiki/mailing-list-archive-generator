Sorry, we place different values on "hinder"... when I say hinder, I mean
get in the way.  Last I checked, a faster machine gets more work done.
Sure, technicly having a password at all hinders usage of the system, but
there is still such thing as necisary evil.  I think trying to develop a
password routine that is deliberatly ineffecient is a Bad Thing though.

Ok, I see your point; I still think its not worth the effort.
