It is a dangerous idea.  I speculated on this on the list some time
ago.  What we don't want is a clipper CPU which is using skipjack to
decrypt the instruction stream at run-time.  It opens up all sorts of
flexibility for GAK, software copyright protection, and means that
people won't be able to see what code they are running on their own
CPU.

I think it would be a negative technology from a cypherpunks
perspective, particularly if the USG has anything to do with it.
