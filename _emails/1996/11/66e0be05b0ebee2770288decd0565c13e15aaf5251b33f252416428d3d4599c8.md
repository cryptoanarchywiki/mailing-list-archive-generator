Since we all start out as children, learning by imitation, and reasoning by comparison,
a valid argument can be made that our minds work best that way.  Certainly the wide
variety of opinion here shows that theory doesn't produce nearly the consensus that
real experience does.

Therefore I suggest that we look more at analogies, but try hard to make the analogies
more accurate.
