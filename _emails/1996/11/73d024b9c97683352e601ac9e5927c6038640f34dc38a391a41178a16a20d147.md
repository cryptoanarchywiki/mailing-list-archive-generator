Thank you all for you comments and input. I am in the process of rewriting
the propsal to make things clearer, and to revise some of the procedures. 

The original draft will, and the revision will be up at 
<http://www.bounty.com/proposal.draft.html> by the time most of you get this.

I am making a single reply, rather than one at a time to save time and 
bandwidth. I wrote these replies before I started working on the revisions
to the proposal, so things might have changed a bit.

     I am planning on using Apache-SSL or Stronghold, if I can afford it, with
Linux as the underlying OS. I plan on disabling telnet access as soon as the
server starts accepting credit card numbers. Anyone who then need shell access
will have to use SSH.

     Yeah. There is that. The other technologies I was thinking of were more
in the realm of algorythms and protocals rather than hardware. Hardware is 
possible, but difficult, and may (would) be better suited to Ian's proposal.

     I understand that. If you are willing, I will ask for your opnion on the 
wording.

     I don't really understand this. I plan on spreading the word as far as 
possible, but if I only post information in one or two places, isn't that 
my choice? If I am tryind to hire someone am I required to place adds 
everywhere I can, or can I choose my medium?

     I wasn't refering to the amount, but rather ecash being not-relevant 
AT THIS POINT <runs and hides behind asbestos sheild> Not many people 
have ecash accounts, so it isn't a priority. It would be nice tho'.

     As to the amount: It really doesn't matter, but I am thinking of making
a minium of $5, just because anything less really isn't worth the book keeping,
but I really haven't made up my mind.

     Archival copies are for legal reasons. Copyrighted material other than
that uploaded by the authors is not going to be allowed, and part of the 
agreement is that they allow the Server to keep a copy for historical/legal 
reasons.

     I will have the name of the submitter, and I will make a "good 
faith" effort to detect copyrights. I think that is enough. I don't 
(in fact I doubt any one person does) have enough knowlege to know
every peice of software out there. I am more worried about people 
decompiling commercial products.

    I disagree. The iniator (hence forth known as Alice) is establishing 
the rules, it is up to that person to set forth the conditions. If the 
writer doesn't like it, they don't write it, and Alice looses her money.
If enough people add to the pot, someone will bite, and Alice gets what
Alice wants.

     To keep Alice from reniging once the money is given, it is gone. It 
means that you have the choice of software or nothing.

     20% is an 18% penalty for not Copylefting the software. It means that
I am going thru a lot of work, and not getting what I want, so I am 
going to get something. I want this server to produce Free Software.

     You are probably right. I really want to charge each equally.

     I think "pay for" might be a little strong a word. "Assist" is more

     If I can find good working defininations (sp?) I will use them. Otherwise
I will insist that Alice document what it wants.

     That is life. First to market means a lot. Look at Lotus.

     I am contemplating adding in a place for developers to meet and 
collaborate, sharing the bounty.

      Think if it as a bet. Kinda like Mr. Bells AP proposal, Alice is 
betting that the software _won't_ get written. Once the bet is high enough,
it _will_ get written.

     I am going to try to keep it simple, and let the thing evolve as 
necessary. As Alex (a former reader of this list) put it, the first anonymous
remailer was a perl hack done in an afternoon, and improvements came from that.

     Things will improve as needed, I am just trying to think things out
as thoroughly as possible first.

     What do you have against "copylefted" software? Is it the specific 
GNU copyleft, or the concept?

     1) As a junior programmer, you take on simpler bounties first.
     
     2) Team up with a more advanced programmer, pool efforts and split 
        the bounty.

    Yours seems suited for longer and more involved tasks. Mine to shorter.

    It might be more efficient to have a "paid" staff to evaluate the 
product to make sure it meets the specs. I don't have the funds to 
set up that infrastructure.

     I am hoping that it doesn't come up too much. Honesty and reputation
should help.

     True.

     I am thinking either 2 years after initial, or 12 months after last

     I am hoping that reputation and the threat of adjudication will prevent 
it from happening. 

     That is one area that does need work tho'.

<SNIP>
I don't like this way of picking a winner ... because I think it would
encourage fast and dirty work ... instead of quality ... better I think
would be a process analogous to peer review for grants and publications ...
with the added feature that the submission of a product is announced ... so
that competitors who are almost done can get their entry in also ... and the
initiators can evaluate several products simultaneously
<SNIP>

My reply:

     In a way it _does_ encourage quick and dirty work, like the first 
cpunks remailer, hacked together in an afternoon, then came the rest. 
     It is a way to get _more_ software out there, hopefully some of it 
will be good, some bad. It really can't be much worse than the dreck comming 
out of some of the commercial houses.  
 
     I am thinking of a way of implementing checks tho'.

Thanks for the comments. Keep them coming. The original draft will
