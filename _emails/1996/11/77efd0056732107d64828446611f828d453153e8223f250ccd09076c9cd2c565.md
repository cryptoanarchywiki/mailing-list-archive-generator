Not at all easy, for a lot of people. Moreover, it's very time-consuming.
It's only easy if you are prepared to put up with costs of time, money,
and also... service providers (who don't always agree with you)...

In a lot of places in the world, starting mailing lists is almost
impossible unless you can be _inside_ an Internet Provider Company
(and use Unix or whatever they use, in their own machines).

Perhaps cynical, though? :-)

Man you're nutts. There are very few and quite vast Media Companies
in the world, and they're on the verge of becoming monopolies.

Even your American President is in reality a puppet of the Trilateral
Commission, who effectively also control CNN, the Washington Post,
and many many many other things all over the world.

And you are saying that control of the media by ownership is
impossible?  You're far out maaan! :-)

Only in America such a naive opinion could actually be _believed_.
(here I go again... aga! :-) )

P.S. Even if you offered me a million dollars I'd stay away from
     your country. My sanity is much more valuable.  :-)
     (The Immigration Authorities in the U.S. have missed the point:
      We DON'T want to come to you guys. It's the last thing we'd want!)
