No it was not SPAM.  John Gilmore attacked Vulis's style, plain
and simple.  Next time I see John GilMore, I will call him a
censorous motherfucker in public.

You missed the whole fucking point, and I ain't going

No it is not, asshole!  That is the old way of doing things.
It is NOW and always will be the "InterNet" -- I helped build the
motherfucker in 1969, I should know.

No, it is capitalized, because Grubor tells you.
The name is the GruBoursyNet.

I never would join that mailing list, because it is all a bunch
of shit.  The EFF must die, and that is all there is to it.

Look Tim, you ain't even on the IFC or the F-K lists, so
what the fuck do you care anyway?  Just go publish this shit
on UseNet, like Mr. Boursy says you should do, and stop
bothering our mailing lists.

Stupid pervert cabal.cocksucker, I bet.

Does John Gilmore suck tale's cock, too?
