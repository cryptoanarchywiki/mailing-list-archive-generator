If anyone has any specific bits of info on cryptography, etc...
please feel free to send it to me...

I live in South Dakota...
Due to circumstances I occasionally see and speak 
w/ Senator Larry Pressler - (Committee Leader)...

(btw, I am not a Pressler plant or anything...)

Been talking to him w/ the Burns Bill and such... 

He wants less gov't. control, but does have "concerns" 
w/ the garbage...
And, wants to balance the business and private concerns...

He is open to any info from a "constituent" though...

regards,

barney



He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned 
my contempt.  He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for 
him the spinal cord would suffice.  -- Mark Twain
