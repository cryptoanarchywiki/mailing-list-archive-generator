I fear you mean "libel," and I think not. (see below.)

Oh good. I think I'll sue the Miami Herald for not printing my last letter 
to them. After all, they "censored" me, right? NOT!!!

I'm afraid we have an excess of living proof around here, lately. <sigh> I 
am beginning to see why people vote the way they do...

I am beginning to wonder if you are serious about promoting John to the 
level of "the federal government." If this was a joke and I don't get it, I 
ma sorry to have taken you seriously.

[Would that it were so, but...] John is not in the U.S. Congress, and even 
if he were, this list is _his_ property, not mine, and not yours. He can do 
with it what he likes.

Name one ad for cypherpunks. This list is John's property, and he could cut 
us all off tomorrow for any reason or no reason. Deal with it. I seriously 
doubt that even the most socialistic judge in the U.S. (and there are 
plenty) would buy this kind of garbage.

> Hope you folks have a good lawyer.

I'm sure John's quaking in his boots. Reread my campground analogy, and try 
to refute it. You can't. Go start your own list with no moderation. Go start 
a more moderated list than John's, like Perry's will be. Do whatever, but 
this moronic thread must end! It is very strange to me that the people 
asserting some sort of "implied contract" among cypherpunks have yet to 
offer to pay even *one* month of John's costs. If you want to call the tune, 
then pay the piper (if he lets you). If you don't, then be quiet about what 
you're obviously ignorant about.
