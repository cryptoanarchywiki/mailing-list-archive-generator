I was poking about on the hp web server, trying to get some more hints
about the technology they are pushing:

> Date: 7/11/96
> 
> Rich Sevcik, vice president and general manager of the Systems
> Technology Group, testified to a U.S. Senate subcommittee June 12 on
> the importance of cryptography to Hewlett-Packard's ability to compete
> in the international marketplace and to the nation's high-technology
> competitiveness.
>
> [...]
> 
> In conclusion, he introduced HP's technology called the International
> Cryptography Framework (ICF). Products based on ICF would contain a
> suite of cryptography capabilities of various strengths and types,
> all non-functional. A customer then could enable the desired types and
> strengths of cryptography in conformance with export and host government
> regulations by obtaining a stamp-size smart card (known as a "policy
> card"), programmed to turn on the particular cryptography capability
> allowed. This would protect the right of each nation to establish an
> independent policy governing cryptography in digital communication and
> storage. Sevcik showed the subcommittee members a prototype cryptography
> unit and several policy cards. He said HP plans to have an initial
> ICF product available later this year as part of a total smart card
> system solution offered due to an alliance with Informix and GEMPLUS,
> with other ICF-based products planned for next year.
> 
> U.S. export license authorities are finishing their review of this
> first-phase implementation of ICF. "We have been extremely pleased with
> the responsiveness and cooperation of these agencies in the review of
> our technology," Sevcik said. "We have every reason to believe that
> the cryptographic unit and host systems will be granted liberal export
> authorization consistent with our expectations for ICF."

> PALO ALTO, Calif., Sept. 26, 1995 -- Hewlett-Packard Company, Gemplus
> and Informix today announced the formation of an alliance to develop a
> secure infrastructure that will enable corporations to speed new services
> to consumers via a credit-card-sized personal information card.
> 
> These cards will carry several thousand times the amount of data carried
> by currently available smart cards. Additionally, the data on these cards
> will be fully encrypted for secure international communication, so the
> card will be able to be used anywhere in the world. HP believes that
> the U.S. government will authorize the export to commercial enterprises
> of products in Phase I(1) of HP's international cryptography framework
> standard -- one of the underlying technologies in the infrastructure
> that will enable the international use of personal information cards. The
