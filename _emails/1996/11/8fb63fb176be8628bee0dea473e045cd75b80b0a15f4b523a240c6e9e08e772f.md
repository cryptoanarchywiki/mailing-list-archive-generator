I think Tim was referring to a "Panama" or "'80s Iraq" situation, rather 
than a stable enemy state like Libya. Unless the hardware has some way of 
making itself have a short lifetime, there will be problems when U.S. policy 
changes or when one is stolen.

Amen. Sometimes these policy initiatives seem so ham-handed that the 
suspicious side of me wonders "what they're really up to." They can't 
seriously think they can control this any more than they can control the 
ocean, at least not without an awesome (even for this century) world-wide 
police-state.

P.S. Please, everyone, try not to feed the flamefest-knights, so they will 
someday (hopefully) go away. Creative killfiling can only do so much.
