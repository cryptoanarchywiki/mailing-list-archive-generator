Settle down.  Neither of them was _that_ bad... just business as usual.
My favorite Denning remark though, was when PRZ brought up the fact taht
the FBI's latest legislative goal had been to obtain the
capability/permission to wiretap 1% of the population, and she tried to
refute it.  (It was later brought up by an audience member from the ACLU
that Louis Freeh's remarks to those effect were in the congressional
record).

Reinsch's shining moments came when he became so worn down by the
opposition that he made the "look, it was Clinton's order.  He's my boss,
so i just have to do what he says" type of response.

Dan Geer, of Open Market, and (umm...somebody) of Open Vision systems also
did very well.

Neither Denning nor Reinsch is an elected official.  Any president we
elect, unless they run with a specific pro-crypto plank in their platform
will do the same thing...they're all in bed with the LEA's.
