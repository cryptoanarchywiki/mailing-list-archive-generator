U.S. election reveals his and her politics 
Educated women have different agenda 

By Graham Fraser 
Washington Bureau

WASHINGTON - Bill Clinton's re-election has shone a spotlight on a 
widening difference in views between men and women in the United States, 
particularly among those with a university education. 

"Men and women, if college educated, agree about very little," Celinda 
Lake, a Democratic pollster, told a conference organized by the 
Brookings Institution yesterday. "Men and women would have elected a 
different president, a different Senate, and a different House of 
Representatives," Ms. Lake said. 

She pointed out that "men and women are coming to some pretty different 
conclusions" about the role of government and the importance of social 
programs. 

Polling has shown that women believe the government can play a positive 
role in solving social problems, while men feel that government is a 
problem, and that it is a good day when they have not been hurt by it, 
Ms. Lake said. 

"On our side of the aisle, we're beginning to wonder what a college 
education does for a man," she said.
