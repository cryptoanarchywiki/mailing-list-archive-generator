Headline:
>> AUSTRALIA - CENSORS STRIKE AT INTERNET, LANS - Western Australia's
   State Government says it will seek to censor all computer
   transmissions of offensive material after its censorship act came
   into force last Friday. [Newsbytes, 67 words]

Probably not as competent as Singapore at enforcement,
but what do people know about it?
