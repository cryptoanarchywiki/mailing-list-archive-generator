The key here is that in these cases the practice has become widely
accepted.  By widely accepted, I mean that very significant numbers of
people believe that there is nothing all that wrong with the practice.
Those who disagree do not feel it is worth the trouble to put a stop
to it.

If the Four Horseman of the Crypto-apocolypse were real, we could certainly
put a stop to cryptoanarchy if we wanted to.  Very few people would be
willing to tolerate strong cryptography if it meant that it was real easy
to have people killed, resulted in many sarin attacks, or widespread
kidnappings.  I doubt you could find many readers of even this list who
would find such scenarios acceptable.

You are right that the people in D.C. understand your point quite well.
And I am naive for expecting them to honestly discuss their policies.
The reason they fear cryptoanarchy is not because it will be something
people won't like - quite the opposite.  If they are to succeed they have
to stop it now before it is widely recognized to not be a problem for
people who earn their living.

I believe that if the people in D.C. honestly believed that the Four
Horsemen were coming, they would wait for the first real evidence
of it to rally the society behind their cause and write themselves
into the history books as heroes.

Today, strong cryptography has caused no noticeable problems.  People who
want to forbid it can only justify such intrusive and politically risky
policies on the grounds that something irreversible occurs after deployment.
But, I don't believe I have yet seen any sort of explanation for
irreversibility that is not based on "well, it won't be all that bad."

This argument would certainly not go over well with the leaders of China.
The people of China may have another point of view.
