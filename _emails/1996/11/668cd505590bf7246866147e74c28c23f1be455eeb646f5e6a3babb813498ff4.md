	The French Revolution perhaps provided the best
	definition as the origional coiners of the terms.

	The Left is for radical change and the Right is for
	evolutionary change.

	That would put mainstream politics decidedly on the right
	wing side of the political spectrum.

	The left wing is a rather motly collection including many
	anarchists, communists and nazis, yet many of the same
	types are decidedly right wing.

	A historical anecdote would be the Bucharin-Rykov wing of
	the Bolshevik party in the late twenties. They were right 
	wing while Stalin was left wing.  Yet, Bucharin would be
	considered quite radical for today's bean counting
	politics.

	This is, of course, confusing to y'all because your all a
	bunch of stupid college kids.
