Eric Hughes gave a two-part presentation at DEFCON IV, which he has
subsequently polished up, that addresses: 1. ways to implement a Universal
Priacy System that enables simple and anonymous data hiding using the
existing Net facilites, and 2. a system of intellectual property
distribution and funding which is based more closely on models used in
Hollywood (e.g., completion bonds).

Eric, what's the status of your proposal?
