Oh.. you misunderstand what I'm saying... I'm not saying its unemportant
for you to have good passwords or anything like that, I'm just pointing
out that rather than replace the entire system, its more prudent to fully
install it.

I still think admins should run crack against their own lists, etc., but
that still shouldn't be a problem to a good cracker.  If you've just
gotten root on a system, you start backdooring everything, not trying to
crack the password list.
