Then I suppose you want to control all mailing lists, USENET groups,
and web pages. These are broadcasts, and of course they have no rights
other than what you seem to want to give them.

But what about this letter? It is cc'd to two mailing lists. I own the
Freedom Knights one, John Gilmore owns the cyperpunks one. Does that
mean that both of us have to approve it before it gets sent? Do we
both own it?

"Laws" do not cover the net's "multicast" technology.

Distinguishing communication types so as to control those who use them
is not going to solve your problem. You are much better off, from a
practical standpoint, learning to control what you see and hear rather
than attempting to control others. 

One does not need a school to see this, it sits under one's nose like
a milk moustache.
