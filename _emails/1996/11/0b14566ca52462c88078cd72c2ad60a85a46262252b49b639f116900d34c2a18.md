I think that the character Data uses either PGP or some
sort of crypto system to lock up the ship's computer.

At least if you spend any reasonable time here in 
cypherpunks, coderpunks, or other crypto related
areas, you should recognise what he uses. 

I have not seen seen it; I am guessing that maybe
they are using something to excite the juices of
us Internet folks.
