The Meet In The Middle attack (MITM, not to be confused with Man In The
Middle) is a time-memory tradeoff that works against any multiple
encryption. 

Triple encryption:
ciphertext = encrypt(k3, decrypt(k2, encrypt(k1, plaintext)))
plaintext  = decrypt(k3, encrypt(k2, decrypt(k1, ciphertext)))

An MITM attack, as I understand it, works by decrypting from one end and 
encrypting from the other...

Step 1- decrypt(x3, ciphertext) for every possible x3, and store all the
results. This requires 2^56 operations and 2^56*8 bytes (550 petabytes?)
of memory when done against 3DES. Quite a lot, but it might be doable. 

Step 2- decrypt(x2, encrypt(x1, plaintext)) for every possible x1,x2. 
This require 2^112 steps with 3DES. If the result you get can be found in
the table built by step 1 then you've figured all three keys.
