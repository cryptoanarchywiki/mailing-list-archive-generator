        well, I've always figured that people are basically OK

  maybe there is an analogy:

  militias:   "the only way they'll take my weapon
              is from my cooling, smoking hand...."

  bubba:      "the only way they'll take my executive privileges
              is to impeach me --IF I consent to leave."
