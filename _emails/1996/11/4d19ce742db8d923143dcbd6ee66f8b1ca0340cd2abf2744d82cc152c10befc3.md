Simple.  Go back and read the Constitution of the USA.  You have the 
people carry arms and form militias which only act in the defense of the 
land if need be.  If the people carry arms, they can't be overthrown by a 
gun toting forceful government with such ease as you suppose.  The most 
civilized societies are those where everyone is armed.  You'd be 
surprised at the amount of politeness this encourages.
