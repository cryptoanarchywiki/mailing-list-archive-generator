Big deal, the General Electric, the British Royal Family, the Illuminati,
the Council on Foreign Relations, the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar,
the Military-Industrial Complex, the Communists, the Secret Government, Dead
White Males, the Freemasons, the CIA, and Scientology are all controlled by
Greys.  Your Aunt Marge, however, is controlled by the lizard people,(or the
giant preying mantises, whichever came in on the last grey shuttle.)
By the way, they also control, AT&T, MCI, Sprint, FedEx, the U.S. Postal
Service, McDonalds, and the professors at Stanford.  Now you know why they
all act like aliens.  P.S.  If you are a professor, don't come by my house,
I've got a captured alien energy weapon, actually I think it's a wound
cautizer of some type, but it makes a good weapon.
