Philosophically, a lot of people would agree with you Steve, and this would
probably place them in dozens of "killfiles", "lists of unemployable persons",
plug-pullable minorities of "kooks" and so on, inside the American Section
of the Internet. No wonder (after malicious slander I have seen directed
against you), that so few people come out with such views. However...

Reality has many facets, and property can mean many things.

"Abusing property" is also punishable already by some (very capitalistic) laws.

I know I deserve everything I own, but do the chicken know it?
The chicken who hide behind roles like Gilmore's for instance.

Surely the ONLY things we most CERTAINLY own, are our bodies and our speech
and other facets of our existence.

If  people were offered large sums of money to cut off one... hand, they'd
probably refuse! :-)  Goddess Venus knows why if a lot of people when
offered similar similar sums of money to chop off their speech, they obey.

I am very troubled at recent events and spend my time wasting yours.
But wait till you see what I figured out... :-)
(with the Greek paper).
