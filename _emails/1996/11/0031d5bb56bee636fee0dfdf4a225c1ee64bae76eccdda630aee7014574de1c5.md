Note that none of these say anything about any commercial service being held
liable for defamatory statements because the service cancelled a user's
account or prevented a user from posting in certain areas.  I really don't
see why you consider unsubscribing someone from a mailing list the equivalent
of monitoring posts and exercising editorial control.  Dr. Vulis can still
post to cypherpunks and can still read the list -- just not receive traffic
from toad.com.  Compuserve probably cancels accounts of people who violate the
service agreement.  Of course, you will just argue that there is some sort of
implied contract wrt cypherpunks.  This is ridiculous.  All the complex
aspects of implied contracts would require someone wanting to start a free
mailing list get a lawyer to make sure that anything contrary to an implied
contract is stated in the "welcome message."

As for cypherpunks being advertised as an open mailing list, John Gilmore is
not responsible for these "advertisements" and has never stated that he would
not unsubscribe anyone for any reason.  Nothing about everyone having some
inherent "right" to be subscribed has ever been stated by the list owner.
