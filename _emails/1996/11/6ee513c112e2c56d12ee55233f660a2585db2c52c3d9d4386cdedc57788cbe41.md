Yep.  Some people even voiced the opinion that it was a good thing
that penet closed down, because now people would have to use better
remailers.  At the time the first address was released from penet
their was discussion of the cypherpunks type I remailers.  The ease of
use isn't there though.  Alpha and newnym remailers are provide
replyable email addresses and are much better than penet, though also
not perfect.

Ease of use seems to be a huge requirement for many people, which is
presumably what lead to penets success.  Programs like private Idaho
mean that there is little excuse for not using real remailers.

People have done this (even with messages encrypted to the recipient
only) eg Pr0duct Cypher <cypherpunks@toad.com>, Henry Hastur
<alt.security.pgp>.  This is also the purpose, I believe, of the
alt.anonymous.messages newsgroup.

A good remailer reference is Galactus:
