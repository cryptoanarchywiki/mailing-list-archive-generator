Surely I know nothing about finance. Never claimed otherwise.

See, for example, Merton H. Miller, "Debt and Taxes", American Finance
Assn., Vol. XXXII, May 1977, No. 2. 

Page 262: ``... They conclude that the balancing of these bankruptcy costs
against the tax gains of debt finance gives rise to an optimal capital
structure, just as the traditional view has always maintained, though
for somewhat different reasons. 

It is this new and currently fashionable version of the optimal
capital structure that I propose to challenge here. I will argue that 
even in a world in which interest payments are fully deductible in
computing corporate income taxes, the value of the firm, in equilibrium,
will still be independent of its capital structure.''
