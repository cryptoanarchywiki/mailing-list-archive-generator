i am your average joe who uses the computer for work and e-mail and the 
occasional jaunt into the internet. going along reading this whole 
crypto-anarchy thing makes me want to cry. the whole point of cryptography 
is getting info from my eyes to yours. period. you can say that "illegal" 
information passes along the internet, but hello people - illegalities have 
been going on since long before the invention of the computer (or even the 
notion of cryptography - if i may stop to point out the obvious).  the only 
reason _i_ use encrypted stuff is because i don't want my nosy sysadmin 
reading my mail.  its that simple.  think about it.  how many times is your 
e-mail handed off?  when sent it naturally follows the most convenient path 
to its destination, and even anonymous re-mailers (can) keep a hard copy of 
the messages that cross their connections with the original address 
included.  you can go off into spoofing address and so on, but your average 
joe may (or may not) have the time or knowledge (much less the motivation) 
to do that.  keep that in mind before you go saying that crypto is a 
good/bad thing.

  a calculated risk based on the possible consequence of an action
 is better than a haphazard one based on poor judgment or ignorance

Don't confuse my views with those of the DoD or the United States Navy
