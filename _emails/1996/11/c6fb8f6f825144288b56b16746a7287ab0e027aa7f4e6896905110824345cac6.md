     If you think that most people on welfare live _purely_ off welfare 
then you are smokin stupid weed.

     I would like to formally invite you to come live in my neighborhood 
for a couple weeks and see how these "welfare" moms are "taking care of 
their children".

     You are living in a dream world. In most major cities there are NO 
full time minimum wage jobs left, other than waiting tables (which pays 
minimum + tips) Macdonalds starts people at 6 to 6.50 an hour.

    Speaking of Pot Kettle Black. 

    In the Chicago paper last sunday there were over 30 pages of Help Wanted 
ads. There is a lot of work out there, and there are a lot of agencies who
will help you find work, and train for work. There is no reason why anyone 
needs welfare. Stupid and lazy is not a reason.
