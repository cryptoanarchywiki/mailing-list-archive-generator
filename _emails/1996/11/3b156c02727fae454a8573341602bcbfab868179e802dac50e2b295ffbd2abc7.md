You might want to consider making that a price on message size, otherwise
I'll just send you the contents of the Sears catalog, the Damark catalog,
the full collection of the clearing house sweepstakes, and an Amway catalog
at one low price.  (My backers could get in on a great cut, at $1.00 a
message they would each pay $.25)
I would say $.50 per Kilobyte, including attachments.
