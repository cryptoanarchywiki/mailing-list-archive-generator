Let's sum this up.  Government intervention via law suits is a bad thing.

And this:
Law suits (and thus government intervention) are prone to abuse.

And this:
Use of law suits may expand the use of nyms.

You just made my argument for me.

Again, have to use the system to expose its flaws.

Same thing with privacy.  It is one thing to suggest that people respect
privacy because it is the "right thing to do."

Isn't it much more productive to make privacy unviolable from the
beginning via technology?

Readers might note that one of the result of my settlement agreement with
a certain flamer who decried the use of nyms (among other things) was this
flamer's eventual resort to the use of a nym.

Interesting lesson that, I believe.

You have to impose the price to get efficency.
