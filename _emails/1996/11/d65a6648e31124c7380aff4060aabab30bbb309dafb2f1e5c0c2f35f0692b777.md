In the September 95 issue of NT Developer Richard Wright describes an NT Key Log Service (started as a challenge after his wife threatened to password protect the familiy accounting software <g>). Source code for such a trojan is provided.

There must be a way to walk the chain of system hooks. I'll let you know when I find it as that would be the key to writing a detector.
