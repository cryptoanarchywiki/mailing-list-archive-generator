As an aside, some of this "worthless crap" written by Stephen Boursy
and "others with no lives", happens to contain jewels of wisdom and
humility such as the following:

Are you aware... tiny Tim, that Stephen Boursy's comment should make
Americans feel PROUD, and that his response to my rant made me think
a LOT?

Perhaps learning from the humility and wisdom of others has also
been banned inside your... tiny-Tim brain cells.

Happy Recovery
