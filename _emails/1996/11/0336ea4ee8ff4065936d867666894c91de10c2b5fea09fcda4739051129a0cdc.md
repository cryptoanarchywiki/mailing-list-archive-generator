Then someone should not do it for free.  They should do it as a "data
recovery tool", advertise widely, make a few bucks, and show what a piece
of crap the IPG snakeoil is in the first place.

Cracktools are starting to become a profitable business as more and more
snakeoil products appear on the market.  (Most are marketed to law
enforcement, but that will probibly change...)

There is a buck or two to be made here.
