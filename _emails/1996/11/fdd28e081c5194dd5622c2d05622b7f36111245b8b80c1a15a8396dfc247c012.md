Watch out for the clipboard which appears to be stored as a file in
the system folder.  Unfortunately, it has to be a real file - aliases
not allowed.  This makes it harder to have a read only system folder
and, of course, every time you cut and paste something you leave a
ghost on the disk for an undefined length of time.  It's hard to
work on the Mac without using the clipboard.

I would love to know a workaround for this.
