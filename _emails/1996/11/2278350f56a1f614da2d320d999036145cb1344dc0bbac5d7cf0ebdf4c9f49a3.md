The point is not who or what I care to killfile.  The idea is that it can
be done by most people without a whole lot of hastle.

There are a number of people who do not have experience in setting up
procmail.  I am offering to help them out in the hope that it will strain
out some of the resultant noise from these "Freedom Knight" loons.  (Or at
least keep a number of people from dropping the list from the bogosity.)

I suspect I am in a number of killfiles already...
