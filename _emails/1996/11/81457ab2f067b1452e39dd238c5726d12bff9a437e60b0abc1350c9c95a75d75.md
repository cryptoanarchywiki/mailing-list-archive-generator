Since Skipjack is protected by a secrecy order, the NSA can patent the
algorithm without disclosing it.  As soon as it is reverse-engineered, the
patent is officially issued and expires 17 years from the time it was issued.
GATT now changes the patent laws so that a patent expires 20 years after
application.  Does anyone know how this will affect the Skipjack patent?  If
the secrecy order is considered application, then that would shorten the
lifetime of the patent considerably (assuming it isn't disclosed or reverse-
engineered any time soon).  I doubt this is the case, and I suspect that either
the 17 year lifetime will still apply or the patent will expire 20 years after
the patent is issued.  TIA.
