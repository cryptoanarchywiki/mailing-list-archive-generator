     A very basic question then:

     What _would_ be a passphrase of sufficient length and entropy? 

     I would assume that the phrase "Off we go, into the while blue yonder"
would not be sufficient, but what about "0ff they went, in'ta the black viod"?

     I would guess that either would be difficult to out right guess, but the 
second would be considerably less likely. Not as unlikely as 
"KIB&^%(*h89hgv&*hjV6*ibHF&90n", but a hell of a lot easier to remember.

    It has been several months since I read the PGP users guide, and I don't 
remember any discussion of that in it, but I could be wrong.
