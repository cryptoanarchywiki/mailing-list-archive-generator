I've been hammered on for a nearly-50k posting, which is pretty much just
a one-time deal for me, so I know what you're saying.  Is there some way
around this problem? I'd hate to take a coffee break and find my computer
downloaded 100 50kb messages of anything, especially considering the
duplication that takes place here.

I'd hate to think that all of this discussion comes down to a message-size
problem.
