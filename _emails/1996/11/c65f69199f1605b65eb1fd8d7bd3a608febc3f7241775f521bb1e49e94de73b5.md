   The VISA-FREE list has now had a change in address for all requests
   to the server.  Instead of it ending with pobox.com after the @ sign
   it will be majordomo.pobox.com.  Below are the new details for the
   list.

VISA-FREE on majordomo@majordomo.pobox.com

Discussion of how to gain another nationality for visa-free travel

VISA-FREE an unmoderated discussion list covering the problems
associated with international travel.  In particular the issues
discussed will cover acquiring a different nationality to overcome
these problems.  VISA-FREE is open to anyone wanting more information
on visa-free travel, or with useful tips about gaining another
nationality quickly.  It is also open to specialists in nationality
law.

Documentation covering the relevant laws of countries that grant their
citizenship quickly are archived at:

http://www.bclimser.demon.co.uk/bclgovnt.htm

Also information covering problems that people have experienced when
using a new passport will be covered.   There are archives of many of
the digests at:

http://www.bclimser.demon.co.uk/bclarchv.htm

There will also be an e-journal called "THE VISA-FREE JOURNAL" sent to
subscribers.  Anyone wishing to write to the list-owner directly to
discuss relevant issues and who does not wish this circulated to the

citizenship programme offered, in the form of plain text to be
archived and made available to the list.  Also the legal basis of any
programme must be fully verified with the list owner before permission
is granted for circulation to the list.  This is to safeguard the
integrity of the list.  Permission will not be unreasonably withheld
from such people.  At the same time the list -owner reserves the right
to exclude those people who do not adhere to the purpose of the list,
engage in unnecessary flaming or offer services of a dubious nature.*
