Yes, they told him that it was for his own protection and that if he didn't
do it, no one else would either.  They told him that it wasn't nice, but it
was far better than what he would be enduring if he stayed outside.  Upon
being released, however, he had the insight of the confinement.  You can
fool a being once easy enough, everyone has to learn somwhow.  Its much
harder to fool that being a second time, they know better.  Like someone
said, the government has to act now before the people know better.
