Could this be the same David Aaron who writes thriller novels about nuclear
terrorism?


(I don't know that it is, by the way, nor am I making a joke. A David
Aaron, with also diplomatic ties, wrote at least one fine thriller some
years back. If he's the crypto czar, he can probably spin an appropriately
scary story to tell the recalcitrant Third Worlders he'll be dealing
with...countries like France, Britain, etc.)
