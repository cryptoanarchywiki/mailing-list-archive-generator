While the concepts were originally developed for a laptop, they're easily
applied to a desktop machine running Win95.

>(1) Get a power mac
>(2) Partition the hard drive into two partitions:

>    make this the startup partition and make it READ ONLY with aliases to

folder)
>    place these folders on the encrypted partition
>(3) Completely fill the other partition with a CryptDisk file so there is no
>    room for other stuff to be written. Adjust the partition size if needed.
>(4) Install a screen saver (such as shareware Eclipse) that will password
lock

dismount

>If locking the startup volume turns out to be too much of a pain, one could
