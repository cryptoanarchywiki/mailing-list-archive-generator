is a proposal by HP; don't know if it's the same as what they
announced Monday.  It's the approach they talked about 6 months ago or so,
hardware solution with "tamperproof" module and government policy plugins.
The example they show pictures of is a PCM-CIA card with little tabs
you can plugin with US, UK, and some other flag on them, which would 
let your card do US, UK, and other flavors of GAK.

It's nice to see an announcement the same week for
strong-crypto plugins for Netscape, developed in Israel.....
