Its been done.  (Someone got it a year or so back...)  

What was funny about it was that i remarked (in jest) "what if the tattoo
artist made a typo?  Would it still be illegal?".  Seems the tatto artist
*HAD* made a typo and had to go back and fix it.

I think that the person with the tattoo would be thrown in the LaBrea ITAR
pits just to be safe...
