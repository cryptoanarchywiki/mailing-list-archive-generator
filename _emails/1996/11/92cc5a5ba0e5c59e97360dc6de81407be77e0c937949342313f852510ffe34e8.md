I don't think either of these exclusions would cover the reference
implementation of the SET protocol.  I don't think it would cover an
electronic commerce application running on a personal computer/workstation
either.  Therefore I conclude that the ITAR is contributing to the
vulnerability of our emerging electronic commerce infrastructure.
