A bunch of self selected whackos running a kangeroo court does not mark a
return to "commonlaw courts". Such courts do not exist within the
constitution
of the United States. Unlike the UK the US has a written constitution, if
it isn't written down on paper then it does not exist. The structure of the
courts, the legislature and such was the principle task of the
constitution,
that is why the bill of rights is a set of ammendments - they were an
afterthought.

I think the courts are worried the way a truck driver is worried about 
roadkill.

Its always the agent-provocateurs who are the loudest voices. If I was an
FBI agent looking to snare a few pillocks I would be trolling in 
cypherpunks with an AP like story. I would also be boasting about my
knowing about people in hiding...

If Bell and Thorn are Freeh's agents then would they kindly bugger off
and find another place to troll. Alternatively they could arrest each 
other.
