Thirty-two bits of randomness in a space that is 225 bits wide leave
room for an awful lot of order.

Here is a (surely oversimplified) model of a less-than-perfect riffle
shuffle:  the deck is divided into two equal stacks, and the shuffler
typically introduces some number k of "errors" that result in a pair
of adjacent cards in the shuffled deck being exchanged (compared to 
a perfectly-shuffled deck).  In a fifty-two-card deck there are fifty-one
possible pairs to exchange.  log2(51) = 5.67, so we get 5.67 bits of 
entropy for each exchange, if the exchanges are distributed uniformly
through the deck.

How many exchanges are needed to get 32 bits of entropy?  That would
be 32/5.67 , or 5.64 .  In other words, to inject that much entropy into
the deck, only about six shuffling errors need to occur in the shuffle.
The vast remnant of the deck is going to be ordered, in the order that
comes from a perfect shuffle. We would expect to see, as you observe,
most of the cards in the deck alternating suit after one riffle shuffle.

Mathematics does not rely on empirical evidence. ;-)

But bear in mind that Diaconis is a stage magician as well as a statistician,
and surely has a lot of direct personal experience with shuffling cards.

Do bear in mind that, unless you distill its entropy through hashing,
a randomly-ordered deck of cards is going to show a lot of seemingly
non-random properties if you try to use it as a one-time pad.  Most
obviously, because each card in the deck is dealt once and only once,
there must of necessity be correlations between cards dealt early in
the deck and cards dealt later.  (Card-counters at blackjack tables
make their money by exploiting these correlations.)

The randomness of rolling dice is much more easy to interpret than that
of dealt cards.
