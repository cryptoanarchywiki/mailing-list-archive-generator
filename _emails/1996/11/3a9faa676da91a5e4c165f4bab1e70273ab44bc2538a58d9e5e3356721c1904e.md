Anyone else notice similarites between the protagonist in "The Shockwave
Rider" and "The Pretender" the new Television series.  They both even have
sympathetic pursuers.  Any wagers on how long it will take the pretender to
turn his old handler?
BTW, Tim, I don't mean to offend you by adding noise to the front, but this
post is a little off topic, mine not yours.  I seem to have offended someone
else by doing something similar.
