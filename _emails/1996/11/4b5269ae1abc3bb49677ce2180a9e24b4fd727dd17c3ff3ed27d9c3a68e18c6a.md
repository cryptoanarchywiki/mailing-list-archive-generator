Rest assured that... I am not subscribed to your list anyway.
Maybe I allowed 5 or 6 messages to reach you, since the 'recipients'
contained your list in the first place.

It's part of *your* attempt (AFTER Dimitri's expulsion) to "have the
last word".  :-)  - NOT mine! :-)
 

Perhapds I'd subscribe to your list if serious discussions on...
crypography take place, which would enable me to better... protect
my own software by some kind of encryption. But I decided to lower
my prices and publish (my dictionaries) unprotected anyway! :-)

As regards 'PGP'...
I don't give a damn anymore who reads my mail, since I got used
to infringements of privacy anyway (since my childhood days in
a dictatorship).

In any case, It is not my style to 'hinder other people's discussions'.

And if a list contains more than 1000 people INDIFFERENT to Freedom
of Speech, it's not AT ALL 'my' kind of list anyway... :-)

Aha! aha! aha!  :-)

You are on the verge on "taking the piss out of" (even) Thomas Paine!

How has it happened that you are so determined in your anti-Vulistic
zeal, so as to sacrifice even what the rest of the World admires in
your country?

I always liked Americans for their support of Individual Rights,
their Constitution, Jefferson and Thomas Paine, things like that...

Well, if you want all these reasons to vanish in thin air,
good luck in your next... forcible unsubscriptions! :-)

<shrug>
George

P.S. I have heard cynical Americans before, being 'sarcastic' against
     selfless supporters of Free Speech. A lot of you people can't
     even imagine a selfless cause without financial gain. Such is
     the... Mafia world of... pimping and prostitution, I suppose... :-)     
(-joke!) ROTFL
