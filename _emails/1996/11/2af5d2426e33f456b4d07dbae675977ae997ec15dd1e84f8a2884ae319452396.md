So now we know who's responsible for the "anonymous" spam to this mailing list,
such as the obscene ASCII art and for calling Matt Blaze a "homosexual Jew"...

A very old scheme, which a lot of Americans still fall for, can be modernized
using anonymous remailers (with a reply block) and anonymous digital cash.

Here's the outline: Igor Chudov posts an article via an anonymous remailer
saying: "Contact this (untraceable) e-mail address to learn how you can make
thousands of digital dollars a week just by sending e-mail." If he distributes
it widely enough, quite a few suckers will send for more information.

Igor will then send each sucker another e-mail giving little information and
requesting, say, $5 in untraceable digital cash for an information packet.

Those suckers who manage to send Igor the $5 get the third e-mail, explaining
how to use the anonymous remailers and untraceable digital cash to sucker
others into paying them $5 for the same information package.

Here's a recent Usenet article describing a similar scheme, using newspaper
ads and snail mail.

]"When are you guys going to stop these gimmicks!?"
]
]At the begining of this year (1996) I came to Canada as an immegrant. Of
]course, the first step was to look for job. I went through all possible
]sources of information at Toronto: "Employment News" "Toronto Classified
]Address"....etc. Always, I was facing this type of attractive ads. to
]work from home and earn $1000 / week.
]
]As a newcomer I did not know what was going on, and I needed desperately
]an income (honest income) to feed myself and small family.
]
]I decided to try one of these ads. it was "Northern Communications
]Enterprise", Toronto, the name looked to me as a very large Corporation;
]since I was a newcomer and I have no idea about the real companies.
]
]I mailed a self addressed stamped envalope as requested; I receieve in
]return one tricky page article; asking me at the end to send a cheque
]with C$35 to send me the "Magical" information to earn $1000/week;
]unforetunatly, I did so!.
]
]After couple of weeks, I received a booklet of 30 pages (all junke and
]empty circle information) it ends teaching you that what you have to do
]is to paste or advertise simillar ads. to the one I read at the first
]time "Earn $1000/week from home by stuffing envalopes", in deffrent type
]of media (newspaper, internet, flyer....etc) and do the same trick by
]photocopying their valueless booklet and mail it to the person who paid
]me C$35.
]
]Of course, I didn't agree, not because I can not do it, but, because I
]refused to be a part of this illegal and immoral way of earning mony!.
]
]What concerns me, that how can reputable newspapers, and papers like
]"Employment news" justify their advertisement to such tricky and
]imaginary "Enterprises"  just for few dollars. These papers are supposed
]to be directed to people like me who was a serious individual and
]desperately looking for a job, and needed each Penny of his mony to
]establish himself at his new country!.
]
]"Please do not be victim to these types of ads."
]
]Regards to all.
]
]Mason.
