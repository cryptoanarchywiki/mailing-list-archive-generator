This is just simply not true.  In fact, since you seem to have gracefully
failed to quote the section of my prior post which demonstrates otherwise,
let me re-iterate it:

Which part of this have you failed to understand?  Look in section 5.3.1
of Volume 3 of "The Art of Computer Programming" by Knuth.  You will find
there a rigorous proof that the "information theoretic lower bound" of
an algorithm which sorts by comparison of keys is O(nlg(n)).

Alternatively, refer to section 6.2.1 of the same book where it is
demonstrated that a binary search by comparison of keys on a sorted list
where no other information is available is an "optimum" algorithm.

If you wish to discuss this further, then you're going to have to directly
address what's widely known and beautifully articulated in Knuth.

That's easy.  That an "optimum" factorization algorithm exists does not
mean it is _known_.  Similarly, while one might demonstrate a mathematical
lower bound on the worst-case running times of all possible (known and
unknown) factorization algorithms, this does not mean that an actual
algorithm which runs in this time is known, nor does it even mean that
an actual algorithm which runs in this time even exists.

If you want a completely useless (but easy to prove) lower bound on the
number of operations a factorization algorithm must necessarily have,
I submit to you a trivial one:  1.  Proof of this is left to the reader. :)
Proofs of more interesting lower bounds left to experienced mathematicians.

No, there's not.  While no proofs of useful lower bounds on factorization
algorithms are presently known, this does NOT mean that they do not exist.
That such proofs exist for other, simpler algorithms (see above) just
simply refutes this statement.

You're welcome to think it's irrelevant.  I, for one, am glad that people
like Matt Blaze took the trouble to do some work in this area.  I'm also
grateful that this has been pointed out to me in response to my previous
post.  (Thanks to "Mark M." <markm@voicenet.com>)
