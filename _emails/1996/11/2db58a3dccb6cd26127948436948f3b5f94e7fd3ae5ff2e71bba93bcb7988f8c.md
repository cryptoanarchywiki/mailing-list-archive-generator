     These people are using welfare as it was intended to be used, and while 
they are the vast majority numbers wise, they probably account for less than
40% of expendatures.

     Wealthy shareholders may not be producers in the strictest sense of the 
word, but without them (or rather without their capital) many businesses ]
would not have been able to grow or get started. They produce _jobs_ which 
is more that can be said of your average machine-punch operator. 

     CEO's produce decesions(sp?). That is sufficient for the shareholders.

     Socialism can _only_ exist in an extremely statist enviroment.
