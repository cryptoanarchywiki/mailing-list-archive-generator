Hmm - I don't know I managed to make this post - I had started writing
a reply, but exited my mailer, and for some reason it decided to send a
cut down version of the unfinished mail anyway ...

Exactly - I spent ages on the same thing.  Then there's the problem that
packet length headers must be specific lengths for various types (eg.
key certificates must have a 2 byte length, even if only one is required).
It is also not clear what the exported key certificates should contain,
the spec simply mentioning that there should be no trust packets etc. etc.

I agree with your comments.  For example, we are developing PGP compatible
libraries in both Perl and Java, and are going to add SHA, Blowfish, T-DES,
etc., along with a better key ring format, encrypted key rings, and features
such as key generation from a passphrase, and we would very much like to
remain compatible with the new PGP, but how can we when there is so little
information available?  I think we need a forum to discuss PGP development
issues - I would be happy to set one up if there was interest.

Best regards,

Gary
