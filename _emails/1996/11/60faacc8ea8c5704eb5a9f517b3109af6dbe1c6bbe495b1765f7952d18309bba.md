To be truly honest about this, (since you keep
putting that cypherpunks address in the header)
I have not really done any of the above yet, but they are
all perfectly legal in cyberspace.  Just get the
fucking point, there are no laws which can cross borders.

Just what kind of 'military investigators?'
Since you are a civilian, they should not have even
asked you that question.  You answer by privete email.

The net is clearly not military property but belongs solely
to international anarchists which can not be stopped by any laws.

Now look, I have told you before.  Stop writing to me and
using the cypherpunks address as a cc in the header.

I told you before that I am not going to write to that fucking list
any more, and if I receive any more e-mail from you with their
address in the header, well...

You have been doing this for a number of days now.
This is your last warning.
