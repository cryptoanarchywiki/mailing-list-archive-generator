Well put!  I tired a long time ago of Dr. Vulis and several others on this
list.  Rather than bitch about it or resort to the same big brother
gestapo-censor bullshit we profess to abhor I simply utilized the extensive
filtering capability of Eudora.

I don't need "big brother" or big "cypherpunk" censoring my mail for me.
We have become what we fear the most.  How prophetic and pathetic.

I agree.... a very BIG mistake, indeed....
