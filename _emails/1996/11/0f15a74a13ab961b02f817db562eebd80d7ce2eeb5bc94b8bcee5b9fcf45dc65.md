One way would be to have some trusted third party issue a signature for any
key that belongs to a member of the group.  The problem with this method is
that the certificate issuer knows which keys belong to which members.  This
can be solved by blind-signing the keys.  A single secret key could be
distributed to every member, but this is vulnerable to security problems.
Also, it would be impossible to determine if a group of messages were each
issued by different people or if it was the same person.

I don't know if there is any better cryptographic protocol to handle a
situation like this.  Oblivious signatures might be a possibility, but I don't
know how they work and if they could be used in such a protocol.
