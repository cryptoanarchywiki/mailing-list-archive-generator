Maybe we don't differentiate between traffic.  Maybe we work on
tempest attacks.  Think about this right now - do you know for
sure that nobody is lurking in a van down the road with eavesdropping
equipment?  Do you know for sure that nobody is renting a room
from one of your neighbors for all the equipment?

If cryptoanarchy is unpopular, once you are a suspect - and are
"guilty" - it is all over for your career as a cryptoanarchist.

What are the benefits of being a cryptoanarchist?  Maybe you get
to double your income.  Most people won't see this as worth the
trouble.
