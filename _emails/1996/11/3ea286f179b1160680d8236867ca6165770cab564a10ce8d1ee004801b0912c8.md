"It" does not decide. "He" does. John Gilmore is the list *owner*. He can 
decide to remove anyboy from this list. Anytime. For any reason or no 
reason at all. He can even shut down the entire mailing list anytime he 
pleases, for any reason or no reason at all. 

There are no squatters rights in cyberspace.

   Defeat the Demopublican Unity Party. Vote no on Clinton/Dole in November.
