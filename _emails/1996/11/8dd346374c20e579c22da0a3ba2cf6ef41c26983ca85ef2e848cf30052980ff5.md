The above is a catchall I have heard too many times in trying to justify 
a minimum wage. What most people fail to remember is that it is not 
whether or not a person is worthy of the wage, but more to the point what 
someone is willing to pay for their time to exercise a skill set they 
have developed.

Those who understand this simple principle and are willing to work to be 
successful, by whatever defintion of success they apply, will ultimately 
achieve their goal.
