As Herb Lin noted here last week, the final printed version
of the NRC Cryptography Report is available. It's a handsome
and bountiful volume; and belongs in all the world's libraries.

The main difference from the May 30 pre-publication version
is about 190 pages of reference documents, now provided
in a new Appendix N. The book claims all came from the Internet.

We've put 13 of the documents listed below on our site, and 
will finish the last 2 tomorrow. The Executive Orders, MOUs and 
MOAs may be of interest.

The contents are at:
