     Not necessarily. It could be set up to keep the Bounty open, to provide
a revenue stream for upgrades, or second, third & etc. bounties for upgrades
bug fixes and new features.

     Reputation could also eleminate the need for judges. If Matt Blaze, 
or Randall S. were to try to claim a specific bounty, people would be 
more likely to accept their claim than if I were to do so.

    If it is GNU'd, then there is no one to buy out. I like the idea of 
"free" software. As it stands now, there is a lot of very high quality 
software free software out there (hell, all of the software I use _daily_
is "free" software), and if no one owns it, the government can't use 
copyright laws to restrict it. The feds _can't_ buy it out for a million 
dollars. 

     The other thing about the "bounty server" is that it is simpler to
set up (at least as far as I can see) than your contract model. 

     All you would need is to settle up the details, set up a web server
with the ability to handle ecash, and some sort of accounting and you are
off. Maybe, just to prove you are legit, a performance bond.
