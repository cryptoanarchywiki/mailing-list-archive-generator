      Sure it is. Earlier this year I threw a party for my wifes birthday.
A suprise party. I had to deceive her to keep her out of the house I needed
privacy to do this.

     It is still a valid example. Someone made the claim that people do not
need privacy, this is an example of someone who needs it.

     Germany. Cambodia, Boznia, Somilia, Rwanda & Zaire. Soviet Russia, 
China...

     All within the last 60 years. 

     Yup. Rarely happen.

     I am sure that there are other victims in the PO's history, but 
not with as big of numbers. 

     1 is a crime, 100,000 is a crying shame. 

     You know that red thing you see when you open your eyes? It's your 
prostate.
