     Well, how about this: spaced between each platter is 2 small files,
when the destroy is iniated, they simple dust off the platters. 

     Problem: 
     Power has to be on, 
     solution: don't turn the machine off unless you have to.   
               small (just enough to spin the drives up) battery in the
               drive case. 

     This shouldn't have too much trouble getting by the U.L.
