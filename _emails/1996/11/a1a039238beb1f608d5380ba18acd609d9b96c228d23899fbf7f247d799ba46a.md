The practice is widespread in the newsgroups, of course. Years
ago when I first started participating in the security and
crypto groups I received many messages from vigilantes who
instructed me to pay no attention to certain posters.  It
became quite obvious after only a few days that the persons to
be avoided and censored were the creative ones with new ideas
and the promise for a better Net.  On the other hand, the
self-appointed cops were the unimaginative pipsqueaks who
were, quite frankly, involved in promoting only their
mediocrity.  They felt threatened by the wiser and brighter.

His work in exposing the thugs of  lava.net  aka
lava(tory).net  is really appreciated here in Hawaii [*] by
freedom-loving netters.  Thanks to Dr. Vulis and others, the
Cabal (spit) and the Lynch Mob (vomit) are nearly dead.
 
Hawaii Footnote [*]

A member of the international press who is traveling with
President Clinton during his vacation here asked me earlier
today, "How's the Internet doing, got a story for me?"  I think
I may suggest the issues being discussed here.  Perhaps non-
governmental-censorship matters have not received enough
attention in the mass-media yet.
