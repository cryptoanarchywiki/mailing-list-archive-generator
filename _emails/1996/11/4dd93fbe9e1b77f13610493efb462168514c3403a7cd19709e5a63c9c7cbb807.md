Dear cypherpunks:

Judge Alex Kozinski has mercifully (unless you consider _this_ noise, too) 
given me permission to post the following message. This will be my last 
posting signed by this key. I will now attempt to implement my new one, 
hopefully without denying myself access to Pronto at the same time.
JMR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To start with, we should probably thank the people who helped.

Black Unicorn, Mike McNally, Declan McCullagh, Loren Rittle, Lynne L.
Harrison, Tim May, Lucky Green, Greg Broiles, A. Michael Froomkin, and E.
Allen Smith all had good thoughts to share, and I am probably leaving
someone out. Oh well. Anyway,

Actually, having run a remailer and seen some abuse for a while, I do too.
Respected cypherpunks are working hard on this right now. I think what we
would all like to eventually see is a "default off" situation, with no mail
(or at least the warning message I mentioned before as a first message to
new recipients) rather than default-on. Unfortunately, e-mail is a
default-on situation and so (for now) are anonymous remailer messages for
first-time recipients, at this early stage in their evolution. I am
confident that this situation will change in the future, as more
sophisticated software is written.

The thing is, I find many anonymous messages that I see on the list not too
valuable initially, and the anonymous or pseudonymous poster, in order to
build some "reputation-capital," has to stay around a while and post
interesting stuff, like Black Unicorn or Lucky Green. This is, IMO, as it
should be. There is an incredibly funny humorist lurking on the list, who
posts the "cypherpunk enquirer" anonymously, and I can send you a few of
those if you like. [The judge hasn't asked me to, yet. He doesn't know what
he's missing. :) ]

We certainly don't want the situation you were all-too familiar with growing
up, but as a remailer-operator I find that I must take the bitter with the
sweet, and I am fully ready to admit that about 1/3 of the messages that go
through WinSock are abusive, judging by the stuff I see in the reject bin.
That's one of the reasons Joey (the other operator, and the author of the
WinSock Remailer software) and I went to PGP-encrypted messages only, we
felt that abusers were less likely to learn and use PGP.

I feel that the fact that an evil is this hard to remedy through traditional
legal means suggests that a very hard look at technological means is in
order. I hope that we can both agree that in many cases, technology can
adapt to situations and problems faster and cheaper than law can.

True.

This point, I believe, is actually in "my" side's favor. There are time
costs to this kind of setup stuff that even the abusers may dislike, and
abusers' names and methods tend to get put on lists that ISPs look at. I am
sure that privacy providing ISPs look at these lists.

I agree that it's not our most powerful argument, but it is a consideration,
because with futility comes high cost and disrespect for the law. Witness
the failed drugwar and the lack of respect for the law it has engendered,
even among government agencies. Often, this disrespect for the law comes
with no legal or political cost to perpetrators (unless you count my ranting
as a political cost).

True, and the abusers already _are_ in a technology race with the
remailer-operators, as I see just about every day on the remailer-operators
list. I have serious doubts that yet-another law would either change or
improve the situation.

The pleasure has been all mine, Judge Kozinski.
