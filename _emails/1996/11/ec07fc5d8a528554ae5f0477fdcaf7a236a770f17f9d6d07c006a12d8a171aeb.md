I'd be interested.

There's a few extensions I'm interested in, as well. One of the things
I'd _really_ like to see is a standardized, cryptographically strong
naming system for PGP keys. Derek Atkins and I threw around a proposal
(the SHA-1 hash, in hex, of the public key packet, including the packet
headers, with the length field in the packet header constrained to 2
bytes), but I'm not sure where that's headed.

The 8-byte key id is perhaps the biggest mistake in the PGP message
formats. I'm finding that it adds considerable complexity into the
message format code. For example, to check a signature, it's necessary
to iterate RSA exponentiation over all keys that match the key id. In
almost all cases, there will be only one such key, but to protect
against dead beef attacks, you have to do it.

In PGP 2.6.?, it's possible to exploit dead beef as a denial of service
attack. As soon as you add one public key with a given key id, it
prevents other keys with the same key id from being added. Thus, if I
were to create a key with key id 657984b8c7a966dd, and convinced other
people to add it to their keyrings, they wouldn't be able to add Phil
Zimmermann's key.

Knowledgeable users can get around this (for example, by deleting the
bogus key), but most people, especially those using automated tools,
would have trouble.

Of course, the main "extension" to PGP I'm interested in is a new trust
model and distributed database for certifying keys. However, at least
for the prototype, this can be implemented entirely on top of PGP (or
S/MIME, I think), so we don't need to talk about modifying the PGP
engine for this.
