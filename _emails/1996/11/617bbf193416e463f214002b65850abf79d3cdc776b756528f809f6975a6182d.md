It seems to me that any such scheme is doomed to failure, unless I
misunderstand what people are talking about here. While I believe that
there really is a `sucker born every minute', and it is that which makes
pyramid schemes work, I don't believe that too many people would jump on
board unless they see real, verifiable names linked with the schemes. 
Isn't it just common sense to say that if people are hiding their identity
while offering to `make money fast' then there is something seriously
shady going on? Aren't people *less* likely to join in under such
circumstances?  Sure, it allows such schemes to work in theory but in
practice, how do you get people to join in? Who would/how could you
*trust* such a scheme? 

Perhaps I give people too much credit? 

cheers, kinch
