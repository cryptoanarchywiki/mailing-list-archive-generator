I personally am getting sick of this thread of messages.  I have taken the
steps, as everyone should when annoyed by useless and bothersome threads
and people, to filter this thread and all messages written by Dr DV to the
Trash. (Maybe many of you could do the same.)

I would appreciate it if everyone who has been posting messages with the
above subject (actually 'slander and call for lawyers') please keep the
subject, to save those of us who choose not to listen to this noise from
the hassel of changing our filters.

Thank you for your understanding.
