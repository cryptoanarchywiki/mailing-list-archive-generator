I don't remember this lecture.  Perhaps I missed it somehow.  I wasn't
sure so I thought I'd ask someone else.  Funny, I called a friend of mine
who went to Harvard, asked him about this lecture.  He seems to have
missed it too.  He was, however, interested to discuss false advertizing
with me.

I assume you copyright the patterns in your feces too?  It would follow,
as they are equally valuable.

As you read this three people I've talked to are making official 
complaints to the FTC about this software, the advertizing and the tactics
used.  I'd be happy to introduce others who feel this product borders on
fraud to my law school friend who now co-heads the Advertizing Practices
section.  Feel free to e-mail me.
