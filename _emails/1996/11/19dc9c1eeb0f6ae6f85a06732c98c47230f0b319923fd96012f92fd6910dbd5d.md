I must be getting a bit dense. It took me a while for your comment to
sink in...

Agreed. The problem is, how complicated do you want it to be? If we
are going to be classifying people by their political philosophy, the
sustem we use should at least be usable. An n-dimensional model would
probably be a highly accurate representation if properly constructed,
but who would sit through the grilling it requires? (perhaps someone
might be willing to =force= you to be grilled, but it wouldn't be
pleasant imo.)

A third axis would probably pinpoint things a bit better than a
2-dimensional model, but I must admit, I'm at a loss as to exactly
what this third line would be. I think 'personal' and 'economic'
liberty are a pretty good barometer of someone's thinking. It's not,
by any means, perfect, but it is easily understandable even by most
people today.

Indeed. Thank God the universe is non-euclidean and non-newtonian as well.
