I like Toland a lot. I do not accept what he says without reservation.

The war trials for the Japanese were compromised by a variety of political
intrigues. Ranging from political issues regarding the best way to govern
the war torn country (ie can't kill too many of them or the Japanese will
simply pick up weapons again with an estimated 1,000,000 US dead as a
result) to the biological weapons that were developed which were quite
useful for the Allies sans the Soviets.

Hawaii appears in *NO* MAGIC transmissions of that time period. If you,
Toland, or anyone else can give specifig MAGIC intercepts I would be greatly
appreciative. The MAGIC intercepts did mention Borneo, The Ka Peninsula, and
the Phillipines (where the B-17's were headed that were destroyed at Pearl).

The radio traffic analysis, ship movement analysis, etc. did not point to a
specific target (how could they considering the breath of the Japanese
opening attacks all over the Pacific) only that the Japanese were serious.

The isolationists were never convinced (eg Lindbergh) that war was the right
thing to do.

There was nothing unexpected about the tactics. There were two previous test
of shallow water torpedo attacks, both successful. The first was by the British
and the second was by the US at Pearl (how is that for irony?) which was
attended by Japanese observers. The heads of state and military did not
seriously believe Hawaii was a realistic target and therefore looked
elsewhere.

Sun Tzu says the first target in war is your opponents mind, the Japanese
took it to heart.
