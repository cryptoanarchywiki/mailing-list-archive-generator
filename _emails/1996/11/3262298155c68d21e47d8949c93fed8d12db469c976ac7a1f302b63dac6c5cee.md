I agree. There are many people on the list with contacts with the 
media (or ARE the media :).  There was a time that I would suggest 
posting all of our media lists to cypherpunks but, unfortunately, I 
fear that would no longer be productive.  So...

I suggest everyone fire up their fax modems and send out to all of 
the contacts we each have personally.  Even local papers can be 
important in this action.  Make sure your local ISPs understand the 
issues (and maybe even release it in a newsletter or daily email.
