In 1968, while sitting at my desk in 144th Signal Battalion supply, I
consciously poked pins into a mock-up doll of the Battalion Sgt. Major,
while the E7 Battalion Supply Sergeant looked on in horror.

His name was Lovgren; was from Haiti or the Dominican Republic, as I recall.

A day or two later (can't be exact), said Sgt. Major was in the hospital
with anomalous stomach pains, which scared the shit out of the E7 Sgt.
What came of it?  Nothing I remember, except that the E7 hated the Sgt.
Major anyway (called him Hogjaw), so I guess he didn't care.  He did
insist I quit sticking pins into dolls, which was OK with me; it was
just something to experiment with.  All depends on who you line up with
in the end...
