No correct period, for the same reason. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, an
OTP is an OTP is an OTP.

More dumbest information, from FAT BRAIN. If an OTP is used more than
once, it is not an OTP by definition. Plaintext xor Plaintext, even in
derivative forms. Like so much of his dribble, that paragraph contains 
some words but I challenge anyone to tell us what it means. It simply
does not say anything which translates into anything meaningful.    


Frequently, you fill in some, and maybe even all of the plaintext, if you
have part of the plain text, for example if you have the partial signature
of a message emanating from the White House of:

       Wi      Jef            on

You might reasonably conclude that the missing characters could be filled
in to be: 
        
       William Jefferson Clinton


Two plaintexts xored together can reveal much more than you might think.

With Kindest regards,
