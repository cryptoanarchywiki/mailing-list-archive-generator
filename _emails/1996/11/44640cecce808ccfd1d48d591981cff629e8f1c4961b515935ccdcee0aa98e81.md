No, it is popular.  It is the most used federal scheme for large scale
prosecutions.  It, aside from those critical of government power to the
degree cypherpunks do, a minority by any measure, is much commended for
its flexibility and convication successes.

Incorrect.  Employees of the Federal Government can be, and have been,
prosecuted under RICO.  Many political corruption cases involve some RICO
aspects.  This should make Mr. Bell a big fan of the statute, unless he
just likes the flash of murdering officials instead.
