To repeat Frantz', I thought Shannon proved OTPs were unbreakable. I can
also assure you that they are unbreakable, because you cannot solve a
three variable equation where only one variable is known, ie. the
ciphertext. That is a fact, not an opinion like God, or Oswald, there are
facts and opinions. It is a fact that OTPs are unbreakable and it is a
fact that our system is unbreakable. Q.E.D. for the very same reasons
except that we must use exclusionary proof instead of inclusionary proof
like Shannon.
