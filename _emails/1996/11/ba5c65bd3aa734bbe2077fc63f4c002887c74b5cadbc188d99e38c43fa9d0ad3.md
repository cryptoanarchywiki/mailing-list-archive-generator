Boy oh Boy! time to flame myself this time:
"Complete Systems are INconsistent, and Consistent Systems
 are INcomplete". At least in the Predicate Calculus.

This is why I look forward to Dimitri explaining his 'Cancelbot'
in detail. It's possible that the _misuse_ of such an innovation
would be against the original goal (of Spam-elimination etc).

In any case, while you all go to sleep, it's me for me to do some work!
:-)
