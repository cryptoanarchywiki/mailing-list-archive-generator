People complain all the time about advertising spam.

People have been maliciously spamming other people since the beginning
of time.  (The epoch here is the birth of the Net.)

The problem has arrived.  Right now it is merely irritating, but we
have already seen calls for more control and more legislation.  In my
view, that would be a disaster.  Let's head it off at the pass.

This may sound like a quibble, but it really isn't: I am not talking about
a global scale at all.  A very small group of people can make use of
this technology successfully.  It doesn't matter whether everybody in
the world uses it or just people who are tired of spam - it still works.

You only need one remailer operator to do this and it will be fully
available.

I was probably a little quick on the keys.  Charging to send to a mailing
list does not solve the spam problem.  Why?  Because it is worth a dollar
to send an advertisement to 3000 people.  What it does do is cut down
on "me too" posts and encourage people to make the best use of the
bandwidth they are paying for.  It would be easy for a remailer operator
to do this if mail were accepted only from the "paying" remailer.

However, if you restrict postings to an approved group of people, perhaps
everybody on the mailing list, you can eliminate spam.  How, then, do we
allow anonymous postings to come through?  Individual people on the list
can receive the proposed post and forward it to the list if it is
appropriate.  They could even charge a fee for doing it.  That's easy to
do if there is a "paying" remailer which will handle the money for them.

I assumed untraceable cash transactions for small amounts were available.

E-cash, the product licensed by Digicash, offers full payee anonymity and
would be an ideal candidate.
