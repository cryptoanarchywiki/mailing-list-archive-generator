Lack of a moderator doesn't preclude you from reading one of the
filtered lists.  If anyone doesn't want to take the time to filter
their own reading, they can subscribe to one of the filtered lists.
This gives you more choice than a centrally censored/moderated list;
you choose which filtered list to subscribe to, or to subscribe to the
unfiltered list, or to do your own filtering via kill files, junking
threads etc.
