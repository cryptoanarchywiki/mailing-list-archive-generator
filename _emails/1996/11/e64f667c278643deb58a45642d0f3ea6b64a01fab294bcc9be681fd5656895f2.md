Nothing in any version of AP I have seen makes any stipulation that the
payment is "one person, one vote."

Thus, if saw a politician killed (and if I believed it to be an AP-related
kiling), I might think:

"Well, one hundred thousand people just voted with their one dollar each to
have him killed."

But I might just as easily think:

"Or one special interest group just paid one hundred thousand dollars to
have him killed."

That is, "assassination politics" boils down to be being a minor variant on
a well-established topic: the use of untraceable payments for contract
killings. Whether there was some fiction of a betting market or just a
direct payment is immaterial.
