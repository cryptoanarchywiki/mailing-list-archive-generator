Is this another way of saying you do not understand, since you
can attribute no meaning?

It never ceases to amaze me how human beings think in terms of
indoctrination and repetition. (Isn't that repetitive too?) 

In this example, previous works are cited as reasons why a current
work is or is not something. As most people in probability theory can
tell you, the chance of something being true has nothing to do with
the results of previous trials. 

In other words, your record is irrelavent. I calls 'em as I sees 'em.

And you say you aren't comparing the net to a home or club? Aren't 
mailing lists on the net? Aren't you comparing them to a club? 
Or are you merely being unclear about your comparisons?

What seems to be often isn't. I am not asserting any such thing. In
fact, Mr. Gilmore hasn't done anything of note since Vulis still gets
mail off the list...it's more symbolic. Interestingly enough, the only
"damage" I see is to Mr. Gilmore's reputation. This is hardly a loss
in my opinion, but I assume it means something to a reporter...

It does not have to be the case for you to see the intended point,
which you apparently missed. I'll say it again: Ownership should not
be a license for censorship.

No. That would be the same thing in a different guise. Please read my
article again and attempt to comprehend what I am saying. It would
truly help your comprehension if you failed to react in a Pavlovian
manner to it.

The clue to be gotten is yours. I never implied or intended such a
misunderstanding.

A philosopher called on Nasrudin and found him away from home. Infuriated, 
he wrote 'Stupid Oaf' on his door. As soon as Nasrudin got home and saw this,
he rushed to the philosopher's house. "I'd forgotten", he said, "that you 
were to call. And I apologize for not having been at home. I remembered 
our appointment as soon as I saw that you'd left your name on my door..."
