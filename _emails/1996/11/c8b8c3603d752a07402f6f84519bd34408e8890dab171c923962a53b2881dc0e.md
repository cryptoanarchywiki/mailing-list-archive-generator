At last some respect!  (I agree with your point.)

Yes, I think they are probably wrong.  But, not everybody shares our view.
Some people claim that we should not be allowed to communicate privately
because of the terrible things that would happen if cryptoanarchy were
to develop.  But, these people want to make it illegal now (a big hassle)
long before it is clear that we are going to have these problems.

Imagine for a moment that LSD was just invented.  Somebody then pointed
out that it was possible to randomly dose people without their knowledge.
The amounts required are virtually indetectible until it is too late.

This is certainly possible, but in practice it almost never happens.  I
can only think of one incident I have heard about where somebody took
a recreational drug involuntarily, and that was an accident.

A lot of the things we talk about are that way.  If they are not, it
is entirely possible to put a stop to them, should there be broad
popular support to do so.

I imagine the guilty will never figure out that a pre-emptive attack
on the innocent would be advisable.

Why don't you take an off-list poll of core cypherpunks and see how
many of them share your view?  I suspect not many.  If not even cypherpunks
are open to the idea, how many voters will be?

What happened to my "all due respect"? ;-)

Take a look at this essay by D. Denning:
http://www.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning/crypto/Future.html

Denning writes:

Leaving aside Denning's snide (and evasive) remark about Tim, if her
assessment of cryptoanarchy is correct, that will become clear in
due time.  There is no reason at all to think that it cannot be
rolled back in the unlikely event that a disaster results.

I would comment parenthetically that Denning's understanding of
Jefferson is limited.  Jefferson once said he preferred a free
press to government.  Jefferson once said that he thought a revolution
every twenty years was healthy for a society.  Jefferson was an
accomplished mathematician.  Jefferson invented a pretty good cipher.
Jefferson was a cypherpunk to the marrow!

While I may not have paraphrased Denning and her (few) cohorts as
accurately as I would have liked, I think your question is better
directed towards them.

Presumably when Denning says "social disorder" she is not thinking of
disorderly relationships such as choosing your own job, or friends,
or spouse, or whatever.
