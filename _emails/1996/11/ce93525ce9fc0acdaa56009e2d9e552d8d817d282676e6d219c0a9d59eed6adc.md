I don't think Declan said this: if he did, then he was lying. I spnet about
an hour on the phone with him, and I said, among other things, that John
definitely had the right to censor anyone on his private mailing list, which
this is; and John has the right to destroy his own credibility, which he did.
This caused Declan to giggle. Those who attend the DCpunks meeting at Declan's
place can confirm that Declan has a decidedly unheterosexual giggle. Declan
attributes to John Gilmore the claim that I somehow appeal to the state to
protect me from John Gilmore's censorship, which is a lie - that's why I
call John Gilmore a liar, and not Declan. I used Declan to get out pretty
much the message I wanted. I'm satisfied with his writeup.

Actually, there is one passage where he said I object because I wasn't warned
in advance that I'd be unsubscribed. This is not what I told him. I said,
I sent a bunch of e-mails to majordomo@toad.com saying "who cypherpunks" and
"who coderpunks" and "help" and got no response. Eventually I tried the same
from another account and got a response. It was very rude of John to have
majordomo "play dead" without telling me. That's why I call John Gilmore a
sneaky bitch. I don't think Declan understood what I told him. It's clearly
a case of cluelessness, not an intentional lie, as is the case with John.

I think this was explained many times over by the likes of Jim Ray and
Sandy Standord: they can filter out the information that bothers them,
but they're bothered even more when someone else receives the information
they don't want them to receive. That's why they seek to silence whoever
they disagree with and not just filter them out of their own mailboxes.
