Your bot is mailing these bounce messages to a mailing list.  Over 1000
people have gotten the (numerous) copies your server has been sending
about this discontinued address.  The message it received had a "reply to"
header in it, but apparently it's been programmed to mail its message to
every address it can find in the message header. 

We have no way of knowing specifically which address is bad unless you
tell us.  While we do have a list of subscribers, it may not be
reasonable to assume that everyone using your domain name wants to be
dropped from the list.  We have, in other words, no reasonable way through
which we can respond to your bot's request that we "remove" the address
from our mailing list.

Please ask your bot to direct its replies to "cypherpunks-errors@toad.com" 
(not the entire mailing list, which receives all mail sent to the
"cypherpunks" address), and to INCLUDE the now-defunct e-mail address
(that's probably a change that others receiving your message would
appreciate as well). 

Thanks for your help with this little problem.
