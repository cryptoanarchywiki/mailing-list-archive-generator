Maybe I am, maybe I`m not, at least I can honestly say I`m not a 
homophobic fuckup.

Termination? - give me a break you pre-pubescent "k00l HaKk1nG D0od"

Go ahead punk, make my day. As they say, your ass is grass and I`m 
the lawnmower. Your postmaster will be forwarded copies of any more 
abusive mail you send me and if, as I suspect, you are about 13 years 
old, I will tell your parents, now go on, shoo.

Learn how to spell and type. Once you have done that become educated 
as to why someones sexual orientation is their own business and 
nobody elses. Then in about 20 years return when you have something 
worthwhile to add to the discussion.

> A "punk" means you are a WIMP!

Oh no, I`m so depressed now. To think that being a cryptographer 
could mean that I couldn`t kick your scrawny ass. I have no interest 
in your aspersions being cast at my physical prowess. I believe I, 
along with the other members of the list have progressed beyond the 
neanderthal level of insulting and physically pounding people into 
submission. However, you are making me think about returning to this 
practice.

Yes, sure Mr. Grubor.
 
> This is your last warning, punk.

Oh no, was it, looks like I`m being mailbombed then.

Yes, I knew it. Please, for the sake of all humanity get an education 
you pimply adolescent masturbator.

Good day to you.
