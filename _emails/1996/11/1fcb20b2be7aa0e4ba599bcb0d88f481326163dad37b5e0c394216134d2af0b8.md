That was me, actually. The confessionals and the priests acted as an
incredibly powerful means for the Church to know what the prole were up to,
who was associating with whom, and so on. And the Church had their own
communications systems. Truly a virtual community, regardless of the
political region they found themselves in.

(I would comment on the rest of Peter's points, but he has gone from
near-silence over the past six months that I have known him (and he was
presumably on the list before I met him at a CP meeting last spring....) to
posting dozens of long messages in one day, so I can't keep up.)

I don't believe it is as easy to differentiate between unencrypted and
encrypted traffic as Peter believes, and I definitely don't believe the
United States could stand--in the form it is in now, Consitutionally--if
forms of language and speech were to be banned and violators of the ban
were to receive harsh treatments.
