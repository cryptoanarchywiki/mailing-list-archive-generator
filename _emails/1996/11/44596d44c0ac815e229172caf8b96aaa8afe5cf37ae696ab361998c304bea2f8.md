This story further confirms my lack of respect for Unicorn.  

While this story certainly teaches us to avoid contact with the police, it 
turns out that it ALSO shows that, ultimately, the current system is 
apparently set up to profit lawyers, police, judges, and other vermin.  
Those groups made out just fine as a consequence of the above incident:  The 
cop(s) harassed a "safe" victim, rather than actually going out and doing 
their job.  A lawyer got paid the money for, at best, merely ceasing the 
harassment the cops started.  The judge made it all look "legal," although 
not proper, and could feel good about himself for (aside from collecting his 
paycheck) turning the victim loose.  In short, the harassment wasn't UNDONE, 
it was merely STOPPED, for now.  The cops had, in fact, succeeded in causing 
the victim to lose $300.  Which, interestingly enough, was  probably the 
point of the whole exercise.

AP, on the other hand, would have fixed this problem, permanently.  The cop 
would be dead, eventually if not immediately.  The lawyer would be out of a 
job, as well as the judge.  In practice, AP would have deterred all such 
abuse, which means that it would have succeeded where Unicorn's implicit 
recommendation ("get a lawyer") would have failed.
