Isn't asking about the "utility of privacy" like asking about the
utility of having a self independent from others - a separate identity
of one's own, subject only to one's own command, with complete authority
to determine the occasion of its visibility?   

Is there anything justifiable about separating oneself from the company
of others and becoming non-visible to them, at those times when one is
out of their sight, away from their awareness of one's existence, of
one's activities, of one's thoughts & manners?

What do youall think you are, anyway?   Special?
