Listen you cheap ass redneck son of a bitch, your homophobic biggoted 
attitudes do not impress anyone here.

Homosexual people have everything to do with liberty and basic 
freedom, learn how to read and maybe you`d be able to learn something 
about the subject.

I`m afraid not actually fool. I am not a homosexual myself but 
whatever other peoples sexual orientation it has nothing to do with 
their worth or value in other areas.

I think not, I do not think I count myself among John`s "associates" 
and we no doubt disagree on a number of issues but you may ask 
whatever questions about me you choose to. You are the one who needs 
questioning, preferably by a good psychiatrist and failing that a 
night club bouncer with a baseball bat...

Decist and leave, you are hereby killfiled.
