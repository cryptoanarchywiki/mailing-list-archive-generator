     yes it does.  questions/comments can be directed via e-mail to my
     address as i am already _almost_ off-topic.  remember people, i'm
     playing devil's advocate here.  so far, while nothing has really
     changed my thinking process outright, comments are surely making 
     me think more (assuming that that's the point).

       a calculated risk based on the possible consequence of an action
      is better than a haphazard one based on poor judgment or ignorance
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Don't confuse my views with those of the DoD or the United States Navy
