Are they the next Big Company to knuckle under to the Feds?  Their
pcmcia-with-local-country-surveillance-chip-socket initiative never
seemed to go anywhere.

 PALO ALTO, Calif.(BUSINESS WIRE)Nov. 15, 1996 Hewlett-Packard Company 
today announced that Lewis E. Platt, HP chairman, president and chief 
executive officer, will host a press and analyst event on Monday, Nov. 
18, that will showcase the fact that a significant barrier to conducting 
secured business transactions and communications over the Internet has 
been cleared. 
   Expected to join Platt at the International Cryptography Framework 
announcement are Brad Silverberg, senior vice president of Microsoft(R)'s 
Internet Platform and Tools Division, and Ron Smith, senior vice
