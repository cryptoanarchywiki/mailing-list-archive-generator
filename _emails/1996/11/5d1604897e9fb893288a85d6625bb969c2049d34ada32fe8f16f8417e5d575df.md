Brings new meaning to "Reach out and touch someone."


To make some crypto points, I watched the H-P/Intel/Microsoft CFT press
conference...the Intel guy, Ron Smith, was someone I worked with several
times in the 1980s.

One of the very troubling concerns is the blithe acceptance by all
commentators I saw on how natural it is that "policy cards" would be based
on whatever governments decided was OK. No libertarian or anarchist views
were heard. It was just sort of tacitly accepted that if, for example,
Saudi Arabia wanted to ensure that women could not use the new system, an
appropriate policy card would be denied to women, and that card vendors
would set the gender bit appropriately.

(This was not an example used, but it of course is a reasonable example of
what Muslim countries will do....not to start a flame war, these comments,
but just to point out that many or even most uses of "policy cards" will be
for uses we in the West consider unacceptable.)

I'm also very concerned that ubiquitous use of CFT means a shift to
"machine-centric" key models. Instead of being able to have ephemeral
public keys for various uses, the model assumes basically a simple
machine-to-machine communications model. "Throwaway keys" are not likely.

Now the issue is going to be to what extent the CFT technology displaces
other models, or even whether non-policy card models are restricted or
banned.
