No. Forging cancels is as a harmless prank. Deleting Usenet articles from
news spool based on cancels is a sign of a badly misconfigured server, and
a newasadmin not doing his job.

Definitely, the plug-pulling assholes on cypherpunks mailing list don't
qualify as hackers. They can't even write code!

Blah blah blah security through obscurity blah blah blah only the Usenet
Cabal has cancelbots blah blah blah only Usenet Cabal knows how to forge
cancels blah blah blah netwide acceptance of unauthenticated cancels is
crucial to fighting spam blah blah blah. See Tim Skirvin's Cancel FAQ.
