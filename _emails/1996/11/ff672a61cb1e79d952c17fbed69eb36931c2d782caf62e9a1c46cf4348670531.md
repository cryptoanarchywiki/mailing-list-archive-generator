In case you aren't clued in enough to know, "aga@dhp.com" is none other 
than John Grubor, well-known Usenet Kook Of The Month winner for
November, 1995.  He *cannot* be reasoned with.  Don't even try. He
makes Dimitri Vulis appear sane, calm, and rational.

Read the Grubor FAQ, http://kendaco.telebyte.com/dharland/Grubor.FAQ.html 
for more details.
