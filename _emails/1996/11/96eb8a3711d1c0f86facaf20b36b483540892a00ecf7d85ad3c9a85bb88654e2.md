Well, this is why we _NEED_ this discussion; we _NEED_ Dimitri to explain
his ideas and his critics ALSO to explain his ideas.

My guess is that Dimitri's 'CANCELBOT' is intended to remove pure spam.

A little while ago, I received Spam from the same source an 8th time.
It even automatically replied to my... complaint AS IF it was not a
complaint but a request for info, and it also... forged my E-mail
address.

If Dimitri Vulis (and others) possess the technical genious to relieve
us of such very annoying spam-problems, I don't see at all how this
contradicts Free Speech, or the right of people to speak when invited
to open meetings.

In any case, I am extremely greatful for the info, and would appreciate
the full text and the sources of it.

Cheers
George
