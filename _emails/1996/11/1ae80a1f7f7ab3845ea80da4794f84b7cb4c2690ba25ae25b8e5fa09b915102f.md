Point 1: HP (if you follow their history) would love to do something
exactly like this.  Microsloth and several hardware vendors (including
HP) are currently working on handheld computers which run a subset of
Win95 (called Pegasus), which are due out this year.  If this project
flies, they'll surely graduate it to laptops, to portable phones and
pagers, etc. etc.  Building a certain amount of the O/S into ROM has
its advantages....

Point 2: I've said something like this before, but here's a place where
it could mean something.  If c-punks and others could divvy up as many
of the supporting functions of "strong" crypto as possible, and issue
them in a set of commonly-available libraries for any and all programmers,
along with source code, then an application programmer (theoretically)
could order up some of these libraries and write some useful crypto code
in short order.  This would be much better than taking on thousands of
lines of source code directly.  This would also allow several vendors to
issue similar libraries, and surely someone on the Net could arrange
for comparitive product reviews.

This way, once you have a product up and running, if you (for example)
would like to replace the XYZ function with something a little better,
without impacting the rest of the code, you could order a replacement
for that function and plug it in, perhaps with no code modifications.
