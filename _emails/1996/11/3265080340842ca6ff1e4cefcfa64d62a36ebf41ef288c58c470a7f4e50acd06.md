The above presumes that you can plausibly use good quality random
number generators.  You need to because that is the problem
specification: you need the TCP sequence nos to be unpredictable.

However, playing along with possible LE avenues of attack, one avenue
of attack might be to require strong PRNG seeds to be handed over to
the Feds.  Or more specifically they might require that anything
computer generated which was unpredicatable to be made predicatable
for the government.

Still it seems unlikely that all subliminal channels could be blocked,
and you still have inherently noisy text, audio, and image files.

A very good idea.  There was some discussion of this kind of thing a
while back about doing this for Singapore.  The suggestion at the time
was not to do it perfectly, but rather to arrange something simple to
allow people to circumvent the censorship enforced through their
compulsory use of a government censored web proxy.

I would suggest starting with remailers, rather than interactive
traffic such as web traffic would be the easier target.  Might even
present a positive spin in the press for anonymity and remailers for a
change.

So what good stego techniques are there for text.  Do singaporeans use
a non ascii character set?  (As the Chinese use things like Big5
encoding). Anyone know of any features of the character set that
Singaporeans use which could be used for a subliminal channel?

Lets give a simple example of a way to create an anonymous payment
system from a fully traced payment system.  Say that an anonymous
privacy broker started a privacy club.  In this club, the participants
place into the pot $100 traceable ecash.  The privacy broker shuffles
the $100 payments, and hands them out.  The privacy brokers
reputation, or the algorithms ensure that the broker can't cheat and
abscond with money.

Sure, if you keep cypherpunks list going even after crypto discussions
have been outlawed, you can keep discussions, and then the ammount of
ecash usage, and bandwidth may be more condusive to working out
anonymous payment systems.
