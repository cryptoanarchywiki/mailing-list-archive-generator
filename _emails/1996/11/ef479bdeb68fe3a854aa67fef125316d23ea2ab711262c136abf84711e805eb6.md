No, you're confused, but it's probably my fault.  We don't really know
what cryptoanarchy will be like.  We all have ideas about it.  Some
we share and some we don't.  But we won't really know until we see it
happen.

My whole point is based on the proposition that the doomsayers are right.
I believe D. Denning has suggested that cryptoanarchy will result in
the breakdown of our society.  The implication is that we must stop
this from happening.  What I am saying is that we can wait and see
before going into a panic.  If it turns out to be bad - and I mean
Assassination Politics, by the way - it is reasonable to assume that
broad popular support for the suppression of strong cryptography will
result.  Even most cypherpunks would support and participate in such
policies if it appeared to be necessary.  Broad popular support means
that it will be possible to roll back cryptoanarchy.  That means
we don't need to do anything hasty now.  The people who want to do
some hasty should be called upon to justify their beliefs.  To date
I don't believe they have done so.

It might be a good idea to reread the first sentence of the last
paragraph.  I am not repeat not endorsing the Four Horsemen scenario.

It is my opinion that your bloodthirsty dreams have done a great deal to
discredit cryptoanarchy.
