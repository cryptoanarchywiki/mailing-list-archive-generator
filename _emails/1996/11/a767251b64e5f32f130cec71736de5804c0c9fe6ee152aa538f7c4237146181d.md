A blurb in the Wash Post today says that the HP roll-out
this morning will include TIS's "trusted third party" product.
"One essential ingredient in the equation: technology
developed by TIS. TIS is so far the only company that has 
received permission to export encryption technology 
overseas that exceeds the government's existing 
threshold."

Guess we'll know shortly who else in the System is to be 
Trusted with Information -- other than Thirds, Fourths and
other Dots and Steves.
