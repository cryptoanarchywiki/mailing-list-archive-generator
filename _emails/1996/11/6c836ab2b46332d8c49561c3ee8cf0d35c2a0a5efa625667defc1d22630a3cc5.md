     I can understand a person's interest in IQ, but if anyone has been
reading the "stuff" posted lately beware that an enormous amount of it
has been wrong.  As an example it used to be that IQs were a ratio
between you chronological and developmental age, but that only works for
people up to the age of 16, using the first tests used to measure
inteligence quotients.  Think about it.  If this ratio was always the
case, as implied, a person would always have to score higher as they got
older in order to maintain the same IQ.  Take a test and you'd know this
was not possible.  As another example "engrams" in pyschology, really
not mainstream pyschology, actually refer to a concept in The Church of
Scientology or an episode of Star Trek.  I think what is being mentioned
is really so-called "crystalline intelligence".  

     These are just some examples.  I am not writing this as a rant;
just don't want the spread of "misinformation".  If someone would like
more authoritative information I could help.  I am not an expert in the
field, but do teach it.
