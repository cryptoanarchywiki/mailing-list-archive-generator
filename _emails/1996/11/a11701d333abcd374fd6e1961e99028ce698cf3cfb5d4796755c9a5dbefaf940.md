Just a short comment: The smart guys will refinance any third-world debt (or similar
debt) as many times as they have to, as long as they can keep the interest payments
coming in.  This is how you get ahead in "new money".

When Reagan and his financiers descended on China in 1985, they commenced a deal that
would make the rapid development of Nazi Germany (a Reagan favorite as well) look like
kid stuff.

Some (not all) economic theories are quite simple, like the physics of flowing water or
falling objects, thus:

In the U.S., for example, you have the world's most highly disciplined and aggressive
consumers, and in China, for example, you are seeing what is becoming the world's
most prolific producers.  Like air flowing into a vacuum, the goods will flow from
the producer to the consumer, and the guys who make money on the interest (primarily)
will do *anything* to maintain that flow.
