Unisys owns the patent for LZW compression which GIF (and TIFF and many other programs) utilizes. Unisys is the company that put pressure on CIS because CIS had developed the GIF format. 

CIS did nothing other than ruffle many peoples feathers and inspire the PNG team to create a new spec. JPEG support was inevitable across the board.

If I remember correctly the LZW patent expires next year.
