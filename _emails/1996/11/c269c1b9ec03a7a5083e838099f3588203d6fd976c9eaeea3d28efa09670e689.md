I found two bugs so far:

This version doesn't recognize either .pgprc or pgp.ini as valid config file
names.  It is very minor, but this functionality is stated in the manual.

One of my favorite options, +makerandom, isn't supported in this version.
This is an undocumented option, but it is useful in many situations.

This version uses +version_byte instead of +Legal_Kludge, but I consider that
a feature.  I haven't had time to experiment with the "Charset:" header.  One
other minor problem is that ClearSig doesn't default to "on".  This could
cause some frustration with new users.

Other then that, it's just fine.
