I just wrote:

And, indeed, it is not likely to be who suffers in the job market as a
result of
                                   ^me
Dr. Vulis' rants and raves and generally insane postings; my situation is
secure, but I understand that Vulis has joined L. Dettweiler on the "List
of Unemployables" passed around Silicon Valley.

...

I meant to say "it is not likely to be _me_ who suffers in the job market..."


Sorry for any confusion.
