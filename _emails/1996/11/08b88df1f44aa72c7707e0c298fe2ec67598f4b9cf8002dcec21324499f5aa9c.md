Incorrect, Cryptography and the promotion of privacy by use of
same.

Not "Free Speech."

<sigh> see above.

Yes

Again see above, this is not a stated purpose of this list.

Dimitri's been here three years?

I can hardly wait (insert dripping sarcasm).


It still seems people are confusing a benevolent dictatorship with
some sort of democracy. Cypherpunks is just a list, a tiny, tiny
portion of a small corner of the Internet. John started it (with
Tim, Eric and others) and John owns it, no big deal. 

Dimitri was kicked out of John's "Virtual Living Room" after daring
him to do so. We can all still hear his screeching from out on the
virtual sidewalk.

To those who call this censorship I say "To a man who only has a
hammer, every problem resembles a nail."

I do admire Declan's efforts however, please keep up the good work.
