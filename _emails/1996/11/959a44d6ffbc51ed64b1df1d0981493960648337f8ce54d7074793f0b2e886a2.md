Yeah!  That was GREAT!  Now let's ban Dr. Hallam-Baker!  He's
always pissing off the libertarianpunks and causing
flamewars...

Dear Sir:  I humbly put it to you that the above reflects a 
misunderstanding about the libertarian conception of "absolute
rights".  I personally do _not_ subscribe to said theory, but 
I try to understand a thing correctly before criticizing it in 
public.

I have read (parts of) _On_Liberty_, and as I recall it was
adamant in an ("unbalanced") defense of absolute rights of
individuals.  The only exception I remember is an unexplored
comment on rights-violations of ommission counting as well as
rights-violations of commission.  (E.g. if you see a drowning
man and you fail to save him you are violating his rights.)  
Perhaps that is what you see as "balance between the rights of
communities and the rights of individuals"?  Or perhaps the
book goes into detail on that subject in a part that I didn't 
read.  Again I ask not because I have a particular ideological
axe to grind here, but because I seek accuracy in public
dialogue.


Regards,

Bryce
