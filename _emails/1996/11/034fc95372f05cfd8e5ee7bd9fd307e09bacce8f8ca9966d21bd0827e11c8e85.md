In response to the numerous requests for us to post the key that we used
to produce the almost 200 megabytes of raw encryptor stream at our web
site, we are pleased to provide the ASCII values of same as follows: 



OFFSET    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
    0    237  55 181 123  98 190 172 218  32  95

   16     82 253  70  97  72  20 106  41 162  30 
   17    136  18 105 227 219 232 121  49 119 218 
   18      6  97 193 180 228 204  92 158 116 222 
   19    145  91  34 200 199 235 178 116 103 196 
   20     79 104  90  22  69 212  91  65 171 133 
   21     92 208  76 127  37  83  92 140  27 249 
   22    229  22 132 205   5  67 203   8 196 141 
   23    136  80  68 156 228  38 254  97 170 179 
   24     43 152 124 172  91  52  79  94 248 131 
   25    202  82  36  41  11 229 

As explained at the web site, that key is expanded to an 8192 byte key and
used as described therein.

                    www.netprivacy.com

In order for those few who have not had the opportunity to check it out,
we will leave it up another week and then take it down and put up a
new shorter one, maybe a 2,560,000 byte one permanently and a monthly
2,560,000 byte one where we publish the key each month. 

Of course, no university, coderpunk, or cypherpunk, or any collection of
same,  has broken the system, nor will they ever.  As most of you now
know, it is absolutely unbreakable. We have had over 100 universities,
IBM, Microsoft, Intel, hundreds of other corporations, several dozen
different government agencies, and thousands of other individuals to
download the data and look at the algorithm. Of course, like everyone
else, they have been benighted, even if some of them will not own up to
it.

Several people have requested me to provide a narrative description of the
algorithm explaining why the raw encryptor output stream seems to be so
remarkably random. I am preparing such a document and it should be ready
next week, or the week after. I will post it accordingly.

Thanks so very much, 

Don Wood
