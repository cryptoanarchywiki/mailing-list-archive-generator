That's precisely right - (almost all) cypherpunks have no idea what they're
talking about. They use "kewl" words without understanding what they mean.
The recent discussion of whether the (allegedly gay) droid Data used PGP
or "fractal encryption" in some scifi movie is a good example.

Some of these bullies, like Paul Bradley, realize that they don't know
the meanings of the words they use. Paul Bradley not only posts nonsense
about brute force attacks on OTP, but also harrasses anyone who exposes
his utter ignorance, in en effort to intimidate them into shutting up.

"Cypherpunks'" opinion of any proposed new cryptosystem is worthless and
irrelevant.
