I used dice to generate my ATM access code for my last bank account.
(10-sided dice left over from my role-gaming days...)  The looks I got from
the bank personnel was pretty hillarious.  They had little to know clue
about guessable passwords or related issues.  (You would be amazed as to
how many people use birthday information and the like for ATM codes.)  But
then again, they though that the "bank at home" software was pretty secure
too...
