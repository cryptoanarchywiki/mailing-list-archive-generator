   E-cash, the product licensed by Digicash, offers full payee anonymity and
   would be an ideal candidate.


  ECASH AND PRIVACY

One of the unique features of ecash is payer anonymity. When paying
with ecash the identity of the payer is not revealed
automatically. This way the payer stays in control of information
about himself. During a payment a payer can of course identify
himself, but only when he chooses so.

Ecash offers one-sided anonymity; when clearing a transaction the
payee is identified by the bank.

    (according to http://www.digicash.com/ecash/about.html)



But what about Okamoto and Ohta's digital cash scheme published in
Crypto '91?  It appears to be fully untraceable and transferable.  Of
course, I haven't heard of anyone trying to use this scheme (has it
been broken?)
