Technology has a base, much like a pyramid.  When you add enough layers, you can't
find very many people who can traverse top to bottom and understand all of what's
in between.

I consider it a miracle when a student has the quality of consciousness to buck the
trend and get themself a quality instrument (such as an HP-48SX/GX), since once they
do that, they might be encouraged to explore further.
