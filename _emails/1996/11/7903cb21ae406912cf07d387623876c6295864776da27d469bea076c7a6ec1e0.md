Web browser classified as weapon

New York Times

SAN FRANCISCO -- American couch potatoes have become empowered -- too
empowered, in the eyes of the government.

A $300 television-set-top device for browsing the World Wide Web, which Sony
and Philips Electronics began selling recently at chains like Sears, Roebuck
and Circuit City Stores, uses computer-security technology so powerful that
the government is classifying it as a weapon that will require a special
export license before it can be sold overseas.

Few industry experts expect such a license to be granted, meaning the
companies are unlikely to begin selling current versions of the U.S.-made
devices next year in Europe and Japan, as they had planned.

The appliances, designed to let consumers surf the Web and transmit e-mail
via a standard television set and phone line, have suddenly become the most
significant challenge to the Clinton administration's attempt to restrict
the export of powerful data-scrambling devices by categorizing them as
``munitions'' requiring a special export license.

While the set-top boxes are intended to protect the privacy of users and
permit secure on-line sales transactions, administration officials fear such
technology could be used by foreign terrorists or criminals to conspire with
electronic impunity.

``We're the guinea pig,'' said Steve Perlman, chairman and chief executive
of Web TV Networks Inc., designer of the units, which are being manufactured
in the United States by Sony Electronics and Philips. ``Can you imagine
carrying one of our boxes under your arm and getting arrested at the
border?''
