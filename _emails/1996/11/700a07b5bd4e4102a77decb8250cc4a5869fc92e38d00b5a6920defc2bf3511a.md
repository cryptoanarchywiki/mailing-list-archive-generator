Maybe you missed my point, or I miss-communicated.  My question is as
follows:  If PGP and DES are as secure as thought to be, then why is it
not ruled illegal software, just as they do with silencers, narcotics,
certain type weapons, etc.....    My opinion is "NOT  A PARANOID VIEW, BUT RATHER A REALITY".   I find it impossible that software that could be a National Security Threat, being shared by the masses!    I believe
either people are nieve, or ignorant of the capability of the NSA.    If
there are "back-doors to the algorithms, you can bet your life you and no
one else will find out.     The conceivability that encryption on the Net
is safe, is ludicrous!

Just my thoughts, and not paranoia.
