But But But *laugh* ---  Ok, here is my only straw in this lousy bushel of
confusion >) ---  What about a Fuzzy Pattern?  ----  Ya I know, that is a
pretty big staw...  The thought of it is fuzzy, let alone a fuzzy pattern.

I've done a lot of reading on Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic in general..  I
see how it could work 'maybe' But, yes it is a very indefinite field..  To
many people don't believe in its possible existance...
Ok --  Any replys would be nice thanks bye.
