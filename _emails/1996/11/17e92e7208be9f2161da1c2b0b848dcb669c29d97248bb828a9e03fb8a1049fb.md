You mean that if I launched an entire publicity campaign against
the censorship of Dimitri Vulis and similar evils, I would not
thoroughly enjoy it, or not get paid the newspapers here, for it?
(the standard rates per column)?

Poor soul! :-) What you see as 'voluntarism' or 'sacrifice' is
in reality quite the opposite. Which is why...
NOT writing about it is an act of generosity, NOT the other way round.
(Which is why I'll make sure SOMEBODY writes about it).


Tsk, tsk, tsk
George
