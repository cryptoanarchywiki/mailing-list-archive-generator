The idea of keeping exhaustive real-time video on all persons is a straw-
man fallacy, I believe.  The real issue is to be able to serveil all or
nearly all persons simultaneously, then, using techniques that won't be
available to the general population for many years (if ever), the agencies
in question can analyze the info and narrow the more intensive aspects of
the surveillance to selected persons.
