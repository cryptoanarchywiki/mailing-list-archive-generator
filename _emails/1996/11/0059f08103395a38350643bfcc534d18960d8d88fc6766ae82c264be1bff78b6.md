     It is not that difficult in term of money or access to start a 
mailing list. 

    I believe there is a equation that operates in life that goes something
like this:
   
    Intelligence + Money + Time * will = Results 

    As one goes up, the other two can drop. Will is kinda nebulous, but is 
always less than result.

    I am not a rocket scientist, but I was able to get majordomo to work
(to a degree) on a server I own, yes, I own the server, and no, I don't 
pay for it with cash. I do a favor for someone, and they gave me the 
machine (http://www.encodex.com/~pov to see the favor). The access is 
provided by some people I occasionally do work for, as long as the machine
is not causing a problem, or too much bandwidth, they let me run it.

    This would make the equation:

    Intelligence + money + time * will = Result
        Some     +  0    + a bit * some = A server with 4 or 5 mailing lists.

     A simple mailing list could simply be a 8 dollar a month email account
with a long .forward file.

     For every "tentacle" of the Vast Media Conglomerates, there is 
some loose nut with a photocopier (or access to Kinko's).

     One of these days reality is going to hit you like a runaway 
freight train.
