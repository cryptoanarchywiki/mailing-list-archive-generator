It seems appropriate to quote Schneier on the subject:

"Those who claim to have an unbreakable cipher simply because they can't break
it are either geniuses or fools. Unfortunately, there are more of the latter in
the world."

And...

"Believe it or not, there is a perfect encryption system. It's called a
one-time pad..."

Cheers,

Ben.
