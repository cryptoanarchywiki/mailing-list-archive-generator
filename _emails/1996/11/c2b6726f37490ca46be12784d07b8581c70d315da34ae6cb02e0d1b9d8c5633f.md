As far as the drivers linscense goes, there are religions that do not allow
its members to be photographed, and the government honers this,(at least the
Tag Offices do).  I don't know the name of the religion but I believe it is
a Christian one.  Convert once every four years to get your drivers
liscense, and convert back within the week.  No photograph on that little
piece of plastic.
P.S.  In Oklahoma, there is no thumbprint on the current liscense.
P.P.S  You can always send your child to school with a note saying that you
do not want your child in the class picture, I know of someone who did that,
(on a side-note, we always wondered why.)
