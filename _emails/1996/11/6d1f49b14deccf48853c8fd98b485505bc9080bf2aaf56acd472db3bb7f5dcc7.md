>Just so there's no misunderstanding:
>
>1. The OTP is absolutely unbreakable. (if done correctly)
>2. The OTP encryption cannot be decoded on the other end unless you can
>deliver the
>   OTP to the person on the other end by a secure means.
>3. PGP, which is not usually used at its highest level of security (for all
>bits in
>   a message), *will* be used at its highest level of security to send the
>OTP to the
>   person on the other end.
>4. The OTP arrives on the other end, completely safe from snooping.
>
>Now you see the problem.  #4 above can't be assured, and that is why Ed says
>that PGP
>is not shut off "right now", because it's probably not "really secure".
>
>I'm not sure what you're claiming here, or what point it is intended to
>demonstrate.  No matter the strength of PGP, delivering a OTP in this fashion
>would render it no longer a OTP.  Besides, this scenario makes no sense.  In
>any case, there is no restriction I know of in sending encrypted data (or
>even One Time Pads) to whomever you choose, by whatever means.  (Granted, if
>you send encrypted traffic to khadafi@libya.gov, or dispatch couriers with
>briefcases handcuffed to their wrists, you might invite suspicion...)
>
