If anyone is going to the Usenix e-commerce conference I can bring over
some copies for them.  I'm already taking over a whole bunch of copies,
I can bring over a few more if I can get them (I've pretty much cleaned
out the bookshops around here).  I can bring them to the conference but
what you do with them from there is up to you (ie I won't have time to
find post offices to mail people copies or whatever).  Cost is US$25
(the NZ retail price is $35 = US$25), delivery is in just over a week.

Peter.
