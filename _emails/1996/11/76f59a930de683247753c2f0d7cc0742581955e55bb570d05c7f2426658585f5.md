Sorry for the extra mail, but I couldn't resist.  At age 12, in a family
of 7, my father lost his salaried job at Goodyear corporate HQ, and we
went on welfare for awhile.  I can tell you for a fact that both then and
now, welfare is worth *more* than $10/hour, if you have a family.

We not only got lots of food free from the govt. food warehouse, but they
took care of the other annoyances to some extent.  Some help was county
welfare, some federal.  Then, when my father didn't go back to the gravy
job, my mother got a good job with (you guessed it) the county welfare
dept., got a good supervisor position, and has retired with a nice pension.

Today I'm a well-paid computer programmer, and yet once again I'm on the
receiving end of welfare benefits (you would not believe how many there
are) in a round-about way, which I can't explain for obvious reasons.

Problem is, even though I can see billions going to people who don't need
the money, I can't think of a solution that could be evaluated as *fair*
by the people who pay for the system.  To suggest that we could support
people only when they *really* need the help would be to suggest what,
bread lines, maybe, instead of a check in the mailbox every so often?
