This is on the local DC news;

Harold Nicholson age 46, a CIA employee was arrested for spying today
at Dulles airport. He allegedly has been working for the Russians
for the past 2 years.

He was caught after he failed a series of polys, and bank account 
irregularities had been noticed, as well as suspcious travel.
They got him on hidden video apperently photocopying documents
