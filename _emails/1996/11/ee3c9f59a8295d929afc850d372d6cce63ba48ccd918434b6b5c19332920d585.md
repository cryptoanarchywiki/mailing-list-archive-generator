Very simple: snail mail is much more suitable to be used as evidence in court
than e-mail.

It's ironic that I read Dave's e-mail on John Gilmore's private cypherpunks
mailing list, which is known to be censored by John. If you're subscribed to
this mailing list, then you're definitely not utilizing free speech.

It's important to remember that petty censors like Bruce Bough oppose
anonymity - they want whoever says something "politically incorrect" to
be punished for their speech. This is in line with the kind of censorship
John Gilmore practices on the cypherpunks mailing list.

I don't know that PGP is safe. That's I don't use it.
(The exception are my NoCeMbots which use PGP to sign their notices, because
properly implemented NoCeM clients check digital signatures.)

I think the censors' agenda is the opposite: they *don't* want anybody to be
able to read the materials they want to suppress. That why they're not
satisfied by using procmail to filter out the unwanted traffic from their
own mailboxes, but want to impose their censorship on any potential reader.
Read the very revealing complaint from the lying shyster Jim Ray for example.

One can fit more info in an envelope than on a postcard. I knew people who
do use postcards whenever they can to save on postage.

Now, if a piece of e-mail were digitally signed, then it *might* be
more admissible in court.

John Gilmore has no credibility.
