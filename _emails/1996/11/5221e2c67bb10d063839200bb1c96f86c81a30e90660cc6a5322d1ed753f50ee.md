The crypto-relevance is via crypto anarchy: we need to undermine the tax
system enough that _everyone_, not just us, loses faith in it. 
.........................................................


Having more of the facts about how taxation works - how it affects an
individual in certain examples, providing the kind of calculating which
both Tim and Joseph have gone through, should do it (bring about the
loss of faith).  

And Ross Perot would be the right person to communicate it, with his
charts and his detailed explanations  (so would Harry Browne, but he
doesn't yet have the cash for such advertising).  

Ross doesn't want to do away with taxes completely, but he is at least
interested in their making sense.
