Who or how many own the (digital) press is irrelevant.

Exactly! With no policy and the wide advertising of this list as a open
forum for the discussion of crypto and speech related issues such action by
the list operator constitute censorship (ie editorial control) and make the
operator legaly responsible for the actions of those messages which LEAVE
his machine. No contract means no contract. It applies to all parties
involved.

Nobody ever suffers enough.

I suggest you read the 9th Amendment again then. You obvously didn't get the
point the other time(s).

Vulis's speech was not distruptive. It did not interfere with anyone else
being able to submit or filter submissions. His speech was outside the norm
but posed no threat to the operation of the cpunks mailing list.

Agreed. It was intended to make the point that this is the ideal we should
all be striving for. We as members of a free democratic society should NEVER
censor anyone on the content of their speech.

This list is a digital press.

Then you have not been reading a lot of computer and crypto related
material. I see references to this list and how to subscribe several times a
year in various sources going back several years.

True, but the paper MUST publish that policy in its editions. Which papers
and magazines do religously.
