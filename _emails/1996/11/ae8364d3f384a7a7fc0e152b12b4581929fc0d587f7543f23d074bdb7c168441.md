The U.S. would have to concede this point, and it would be a likely one
for it to concede.  The reasonable Schelling point for inter-governmental
relationships on this matter is for the each government to have access
to whatever communications it likes within its borders but that the
contents of communications between governments is shared.  This could
be set up exactly the same way tax treaties are set up now.

Technically, this is not hard to do.  For instance, I think PGP encrypts
messages for multiple recipients by encrypting the same session key
with each recipient's public key, and then attaching the same IDEA
encrypted ciphertext:

<Session Key with Alice's Public Key><Session Key with Bob's Public Key>
<IDEA encrypted message>

All GAK requires is that you also encrypt the session key with the
government's key:

<Session Key with Alice's Public Key><Session Key with Bob's Public Key>
<Session Key with Eve's Public Key><IDEA encrypted message>

For multiple government access to keys, you encrypt the session key
with the foreign government's key, too:

<Session Key with Alice's Public Key><Session Key with Bob's Public Key>
<Session Key with Eve's Public Key><Session Key with Yvette's Public Key>
<IDEA encrypted message>

Yes, there is a problem with uncooperative foreign governments who
won't prosecute people who send in non-GAKed messages.  So, we simply
terminate communications with those countries.  It's something the
government wants to do anyway, so it's not a painful pill to swallow.

The scheme I described above does not require co-release of keys.

It may be the case that the USG is trying to pull a cypherpunk maneuver
on other less sophisticated governments.  That is, they are probably
telling the other governments, "You've got a real problem here.  You
will be overthrown if you don't get our help fast with our sophisticated
encryption technology!  And if you don't let us help, you'll lose most
favored nation status."  By the time other policy makers figure out the
implications of this, it will be too late.  Sad for them, but good
news for the U.S. consumer.

Nothing stops you from sending fully encrypted messages to Libya except
your fear of social disgrace and a long prison term.
