You don`t seem to realise that not only is my reputation unnafected 
by your worthless drivel about "brute force attacks on one time 
pads", which everyone else apart from you and Don immediately 
accepted as a simple misunderstanding of the topic of the message (I 
was talking about stream ciphers), but I am finding it rather amusing 
to watch the level of your rants deteriorate to the point where you 
now label anyone who actually posts about cryptography on this list 
as a "k00l hAcKiNg D00d" who knows nothing of what he is talking 
about. And as for harrasing people to shut up if you had been 
watching the traffic on the list you would have noticed that I 
disagreed with John over throwing you off the list. I simply wonder 
if the reason you appear to be so calm offline but a foaming at the 
mouth lunatic online is that you are scared someone is going to give 
you the good kicking you so rightly deserve.

And I suppose the opinion of a man who cannot control his urges to 
post rants about "sovok jews" and armenian refugees is of great value 
to the learned and worthy???
