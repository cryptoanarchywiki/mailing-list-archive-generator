What both of these arguments (moreso the first) fail to mention is an individual's
investment in time and possibly a lot of money in various memberships, with expec-
tations that they will have the opportunity to develop and express themselves to
their utmost capability.  When I have a problem with some of the dirty things my
representatives in Washington DC do on my behalf, people say "like the U.S. or
leave it", etc., as though my father, his father, his father, etc. clear back to
the 1600's in the colonies here, wasted their blood on the battlefields defending
these assholes who like to say "you can just leave if you don't like it".

The squashing of people's dreams begins at birth with selfish and shortsighted parents,
and since that and other oppressions permeates our brains at every level, it's a wonder
that some people are as accomplished and expressive as they are.  This topic as it's
been handled so far by most of the subscribers is prima facie evidence that most of
the people in the industrialized countries are just good little suck-up fascists.
