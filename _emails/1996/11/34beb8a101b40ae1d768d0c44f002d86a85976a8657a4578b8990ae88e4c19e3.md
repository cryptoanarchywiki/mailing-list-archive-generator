Those people who live a very simple life [no TV, or at least no Cable TV,
sleep on the floor with a small, thin mattress, use very little power
outside of what's necessary for the laptop AC adapters, drive the smallest
cheapest car available, wear old clothing, wear a beard to cut down on
shaving, eat mostly veggie and mostly fresh, avoid doctors and drugstore
products, stay away from large-corporation jobs, move frequently, rent
but never buy, .... (you get the picture)] will get by just fine, and
will have the flexibility to make large-scale adjustments rather easily.

People who consider the opposite of some of the things mentioned above as
very important to them will have to deal with the bad news.
