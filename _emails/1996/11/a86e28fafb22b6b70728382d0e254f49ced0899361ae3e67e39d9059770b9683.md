You forgot the property situation under each.

Anarchy: (IMO belongs left of monarchy, just to keep it mathematical)
           Ownership and distribution of product of ownership
              controlled by the strongest mob.

Monarchy:  Ownership by the one. Privileged few allowed to make use of
              it.

Oligarchy:
           Communist: No private ownership. Distribution of product by
              the state.
           Fascist: Private ownership allowed. Distribution of product
              by the state.

Democracy: Ownership and distribution by the loudest mob.

Republic:  Private ownership and private determination of
              distribution.
            (Major paradigm shift in governance - away from whims of
              one/few/many *people* to *objective laws*.) 
                  NOTE: Key word here is *objective* - not law. Whims
                        are subjective.
