This is yet another reason the Federal government is going to find it so 
difficult to ban or regulate digital cash.  With the collective precedents 
of paper money, then checks, then credit cards, then traveler's checks,  
then debit cards, and so forth, the addition of yet another medium of 
exchange doesn't appear to be a really new concept.  

Also, as far as I understand it, there is nothing illegal about spending (or 
accepting) foreign money inside the US, and in many if not most countries it 
is, likewise, not illegal to spend foreign money there as well.    
Obviously, the precedents allowing digital cash far outweigh those which 
could be marshalled to prohibit it.\
