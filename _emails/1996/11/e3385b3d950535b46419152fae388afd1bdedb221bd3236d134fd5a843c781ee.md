Lots of TV specials lately on stealing cell-phone codes and cloning phones.
Seems to me that this would be ridiculously easy to stop using crypto.  

As a side issue (related to your comment about banning the listening in on
cell-phone calls).  I find it pretty amazing that it is possible to make it
illegal to listen to signals broadcast over public airways.  Yet another way
crypto will help society - it will make such laws restricting our freedoms
obsolete.
