It was suggested that concerned people would want to band together and defend against
this sort of thing.  I say, since the govt. and media (same thing) use heaps of this
stuff against us, and have been doing so for years, why doesn't some of that energy
being coordinated for "cracking" DES be turned into the same kind of disinformation
weapon described above, and used against the oppressors of the people?
