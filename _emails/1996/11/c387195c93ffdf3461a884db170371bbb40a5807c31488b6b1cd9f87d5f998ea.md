Those of you who think that it was wrong, unwarranted censorship for John Gilmore to take Dr. Vulis off the list should note this sentence from John's message:

	When he posted a message saying that we'd
	have to use technical means to stop him from 
	flaming the list, I said, "OK".


It was Vulis who challenged John to stop him by technical means.  It was at John's discretion to do so, and he took the liberty of  following up on Vulis' challenge.

Vulis did everything to set himself up for what he got, did he not.
