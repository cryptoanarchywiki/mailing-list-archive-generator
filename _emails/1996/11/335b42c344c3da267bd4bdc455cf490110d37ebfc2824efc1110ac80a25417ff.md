I find this to be largely true as well.  The cyberpunk genre does the
best job at grappling with the impact of communications tech but it is
traditionally dystopian.  It would be nice to see a story about better
living through crypto.

What fiction can people recommend which presents crypto/privacy issues
realistically?  How about this new book that Neal Stephenson is working
on, does anyone know what it's about?  His short story, "Hack the Spew",
a few months ago (in Wired, I think?) had a strong crypto flavor.
