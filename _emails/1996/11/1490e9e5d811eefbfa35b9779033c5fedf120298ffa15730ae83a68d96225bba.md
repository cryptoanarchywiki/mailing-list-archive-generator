If people feel they have to go "underground" in order to protect
themselves, you will see near unanimous support for mandatory GAK.
This qualifies as a nightmare scenario for almost everybody, even
many of the readers of this list.

Universal traceability and identifiability is not necessarily a
consequence of GAK.  By universal I mean "available to everyone."
Were this to be a problem, the information would be confined to
"responsible" parties.  I think I can describe a way to do this in
nearly every scenario.  There is certainly no reason why driver's
license data need be on the Web.
