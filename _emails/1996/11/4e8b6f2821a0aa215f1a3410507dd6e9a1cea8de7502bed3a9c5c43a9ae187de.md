"Imposing their moral view on me"?

A distinction has to be made between "imposing," as in applying force, and
expressing an opinion.

What I said a while back is that I'm getting more than a little tired of
threats and bluster about filing lawsuits. If Black Unicorn wants to use
the American legal system in this way, he _should_. But "saber rattling"
about it is getting old.

(I also find his threats applied inconsistently, as when he advises one of
his opponents that making a mention of "medications" may be "actionable,"
while ignoring the many, many comments by me, Sandy, and others of our ilk
about people needing to get back on their lithium or thorazine. And, by the
way, it's _not_ actionable to make such jibes, at least not yet.)

Hardly a matter of "imposing my moral values on him," as he is perfectly
free to ignore my comments, or rebut them, etc.
