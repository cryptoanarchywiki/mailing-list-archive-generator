Irrelevant analogy; snail.mail and e-mail.  The former is in physical
form, and the latter usually never is.

Anonymity on the InterNet is a Constitutional right, and is the
sole supporter of freedom of speech.

I disagree, anonymity is a good thing that will never
be questioned by anybody, but your PGP will, and it
is really not safe anyway.

If you do not send it to me by e-mail, I will never see it.
Why are you so paranoid that someone is reading your e-mail?
I never do anything criminal, so I could give a shit less if
everybody reads all of my fucking mail.

Again, inconsistant analogy.  This is nothing but photons in it's
ultimate form, and it will never see paper.  Anything that _you_
print is not attributable to me, and any e-mail printed by you
would never be acceptable as a court exhibit.

stop getting cyberspace mixed up with print.

why do you put that cypherpunks address in the header?
just where did this e-mail originate from?

Steve, are you on that cypherpunks list?
