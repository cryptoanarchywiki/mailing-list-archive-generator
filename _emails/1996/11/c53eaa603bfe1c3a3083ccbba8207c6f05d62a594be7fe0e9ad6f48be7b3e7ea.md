   I am not suggesting patent-like protection.  Rather, I'd argue that there
is very little "independent creation" with respect to my personal database.
Provided it is considered my database to begin with, information that I give
on a warranty card, when I ask for credit, etc. remains mine under the
proposed U.S. law.  Just because a third party tries to assemble it from
those sources doesn't mean it suddenly becomes free data, from a
non-database source.  By that line of reasoning, any protected database
would lose all protection upon its publication by a licensee, so long as you
copied it from the licensee and not the originator.  This is not how I read
the proposed law, and it is not how big database publishers would want it read.

(Nothing in this line of argument is meant to imply that I am in favor of
the proposal.)
