And here's a new one from today's (11/18/96) New York Times:

For complete story, see:
http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/national/child-pornographer.html


On Prison Computer, Files to Make Parents Shiver By Nina Bernstein

For two years, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been looking into
a computer programming and telemarketing business that is run by inmates
at a Minnesota prison after agents seized child pornography files.

  -30-

The story explains how investiagtors found not just child pornography, but 
a list of names, ages, personal details ("latchkey kids," "speech 
difficulties," etc.) of children "most[ly] girls between 3 and 12" 
alphabetized by town and coded by map coordintates.
