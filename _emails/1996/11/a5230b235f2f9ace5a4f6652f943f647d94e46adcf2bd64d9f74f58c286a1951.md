Used to be that if you wanted dirty words or pictures, you had to go to Paris.

Used to be that if you wanted Nazis, you had to go to Deutschland.

Used to be that if you wanted to know how to blow things up, you had to go
to the US Government Printing Office.

Used to be that if you wanted racists, you had to go to Alabama.

Used to be that if you wanted commies, you had to go to Moscow (or at least
the LSE).

Used to be that if you wanted garrulous bores, you had to go to you local
watering hole.

Used to be that if you wanted child molesters you had to go to your local
public school.

Used to be that if you wanted a cop you had to go to the nearest doughnut
shop.

Now you can get all of the above and more from the privacy of your own home
on the Internet.
