I wish there were a way to inform people that the ADL is not a "Jewish"
group just because they so claim.  Informed persons have pointed to the
not-so-coincidental founding of this organization at approximately the
same time as the Federal Reserve and the Income Tax, and just a few years
after the founding of the FBI by Napoleon's grandson.

Word is that while the World Jewish Congress declared war on Hitler in
1933, the ADL actually *suppressed* Jewish dissent in the U.S., at least
until 1937-38, because it was "good for business". I wouldn't call these
ADL people "Jewish", I'd call them pals of Prescott Bush and Averell
Harriman, to name a couple of supreme scumbags.  The same people and
ideology who propped up Hitler are foaming at the mouth now over their
good fortunes in China and other parts of SE Asia.

As far as whether a person's ethnicity makes a difference in their govt.
positions, a la the DCI, it's my feeling that certain ties and loyalties
are exploited by the scum at the top for their own gain (and they don't
give a damn about religion, at least in any normal sense), and to see a
possible analogy for this, look at Stone's JFK movie, where the CIA et al
were using gay men that they could blackmail at the time, for jobs where
they didn't want people to talk.

BTW, 1913 (nice number, huh?) was the year for the 3 things listed above.
Those things were enacted in the Taft administration, Taft being the
grandson of the founder of Skull and Bones, the control group for the
Bush and Harriman clan.  Wot a coincidence, eh?
