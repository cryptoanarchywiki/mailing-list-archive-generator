First of all, do you need references?  Your boss would probably be the best
one, unless you destroy h[is,er] faith in you.
Second, when would they fire you anyway?  Two th three weeks later?  After
your grace period expired?  By then you should already be out of your
office.  Unless you need the course for your free enterprize work.
If not, you could impress your boss, (and possibly get a few extra
government contracts down the line), by volunteering to stay at your desk as
you won't need the material for your employment.
The above was made under the assumption that your branch occasionaly
"outsources" projects or calls on private consultants when it needs extra
hands (minds).
