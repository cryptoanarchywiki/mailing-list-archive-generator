However since governments attempt to maintain a geographical monopoly and
there are a very limited number of them, it is not possible to find another
country you can enter as a matter of right so you may not be able to
escape.  In contrast there are millions of private organizations of various
sorts (corporations, etc) and it is trivial to find one to join if you like.
