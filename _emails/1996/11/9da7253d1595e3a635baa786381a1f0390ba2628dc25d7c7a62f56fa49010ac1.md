Subject: Fade to Black Update

The Fade to Black Pages have been updated.


This week we started the official Senator Exon Countdown Clock. (Days till
retirement on Jan 3 1997). We also made it available for you to submit your
own personal message to the Senator.
All the messages will be delivered via certified Fed-X on his last days in
office. Now you to can send a personal greeting to the Senator allowing him
to know how much you appreciated all he has attempted to do for the Internet.
We would attempt to send it via a Email, but the respected Senator does not
have Email. (The Irony).
