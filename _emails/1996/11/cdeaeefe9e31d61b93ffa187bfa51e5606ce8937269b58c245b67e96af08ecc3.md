Careful about the passive construction "was exposed." I took the
announcement, presumably based on his summary to R. Hettinga, and
containing biographical information which he presumably supplied, to be an
active decision by him to "come out of the closet."

Exactly as you did, Peter, by breaking your silence of many months (based
on your fears of a pogrom, as you admitted) and suddenly posting a large
number of posts in one day. It would be misleading for us to say "Peter
Hendrickson was exposed." You exposed yourself. As did S, L. vonBernhardt.

Ditto for Lucky Green, who has revealed his True Name to various of us, and
whose True Name could probably be deduced by anyone by spending a few
minutes with Deja News or Alta Vista.
