Well, in the 23 years I've been on the Net in one way or another, I can
honestly say it is _increased_ my exposure to garbage. The notion that
computers are time-savers is fraught with problems. For some tasks, it
clearly is.

But for other tasks and situations, it's a time sink. I view it primarily
as a communications mechanism, e.g., lists like this, the Web, news, etc.
Your mileage may vary.

Notions that computers will be widely accepted because of their
"time-saving" powers I file right next to claims that computers will be
useful for storing recipes and balancing checkbooks.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
