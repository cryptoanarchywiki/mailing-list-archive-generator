I saw what happened. It's very sad.

P.S. Nobody can threaten another site or another invidual and keep
     one's humanity for too long. I often regret angry emotions,
     as we all do. The saddening thing is when threats get _too_ far.
     I cannot control anybody's behaviour, nor have endless energy
     to explain things. I am but an ignorant little cog in the Wheels
     most of the time, and need an atmosphere of trust like everybody.
     I can see truth buried under a lot of people's rudeness, and I
     can see violence buried in a lot of people's politeness. Silence
     is sometimes the best policy. I do not enforce it on anybody.
     I take a vow of silence when saying anything makes things worse.
