In other words, you can't prove it.  Thought so.

Page number?

Perhaps it would be helpful to hear a possible proof.  If somebody
were to show that breaking a certain cryptographic algorithm was
NP-complete, many people would find this almost as good as proof that
the algorithm is unbreakable.

Then if a clever person were to show that the NP-complete problems
were not solvable in any faster way than we presently know how, you
would have proof that a cryptographic algorithm was unbreakable.

There is no obvious reason why such a proof is not possible.
