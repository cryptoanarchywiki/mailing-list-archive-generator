Okay, this would work.  But, it requires that all (or at least many) of the
Members of Parliament cooperate.  If not, then the security officer will
be able to make very good guesses about who is speaking.

Parliamentarians may not cooperate for a variety of reasons.  They may
not wish to be attacked by terrorists for the words of others.  They
may believe that cowardice is not to be encouraged.  They may not believe
in anonymity.  It might be too hard for them.

What I would like to see is a method which relies only on published
public keys and no other cooperation from the people who are (more
or less) being used as shields.  This may be impossible.

(A number of people have posted references to other ways of doing
this.  I have yet to track down the references they gave so I don't
know if any of them fit the bill.)
