a locked startup disk is not a good idea, if it is even possible.
Most applications setup scratch space on the startup volume.  It would
be a better idea to setup a partition for applications and lock it, if
you feel that is necessary.  Norton DiskLock is a nice tool that
provides a startup password protection as well as screensaver
password.  It will request a password if the machine sleeps or to
reboot after a crash.
