[snip, snip]

A vastly more accurate analogy is that the "Doctor" is not in fact inside of the bar,
as none of the cypherpunks are inside of anyone's home but their own.  Vulis is some-
where else, sending his brand of beer to the bar in competition with a number of
other "vendors".  Customers and vendors alike complain that Vulis' bottles have
offensive portraits on them, possibly famous sports figures in an unflattering light.

So the bar owner bans Vulis' beer, but he sends it in anyway through a third party,
and several patrons discover that they can easily remove the outer label from the
bottle and see the original portraits.

There are similarities to Prohibition here.

Now the bar owner, being the owner, can throw out anyone he wants to anytime, and he
gets away with this with little or no trouble lawsuit-wise, since the courts are much
more lenient with owners of bars and rock-n-roll venues that with, say, Denny's
Restaurants.

As I've said before, all forums on the net can be arranged at some point in the future
to be "privately" owned, and the question is, can there be a free speech forum where
you won't be arbitrarily banned?
