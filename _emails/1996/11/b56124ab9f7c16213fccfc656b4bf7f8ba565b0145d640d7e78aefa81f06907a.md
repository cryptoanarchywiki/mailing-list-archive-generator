I regret that after lurking for so long my first post is related to this....

        While it is true that Cypherpunks IS a much sampled list, it's my
opinion that the distribution in the level of education among subscribers is
rather skewed.  I therefore believe that the "average" subscriber to this
list would be intelligent and competent enough to form their own conclusions
regarding the validity of the opinions expressed by anyone.
        I like to believe that the labels I assign to groups are based on a
representative sampling of the given population, not by the sampling a
select few.  It's again my opinion that if others can't do that, and
<cliche>judge books by their covers</cliche>, it's their loss.

        I'm sure that the decision wasn't made hastily or lightly.  It
doesn't change anything though - the damage is done.  If even one person
doubts the credibility or integrity of either John or the list, then Dr.
Vulius has won.

        The problem lies in determining who defines the protocols and
punishments, especially on a list such as this.  For someone who espouses
freedom of speech to arbitrarily censor someone is indeed hypocritical.  

        I'm not defending Dr. Vulius - for some time now, he and a number of
others have been filtered into my Humour mailbox.  I'm just spewing off
about having the _choice_ to ignore him or not, as _I_ see fit, you know - 

"... and then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak out."
