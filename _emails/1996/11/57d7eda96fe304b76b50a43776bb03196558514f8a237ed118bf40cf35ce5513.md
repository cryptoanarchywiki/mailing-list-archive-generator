I'll have to research this.  Thank you for the idea.

What I would really like to see is a way in which the "shields" are
not required to participate at all, other than by publishing their
public key.  If terrorists are involved, they may not wish to be on
the suspect list.

I've been toying with schemes that multiply the Ns from everybody's
public key to create a new semi-anonymous public key.  The only
problem is that in each case either identity is revealed or the
person seeking semi-anonymously reveals their secret key.  So,
I am not quite there.  ;-)
