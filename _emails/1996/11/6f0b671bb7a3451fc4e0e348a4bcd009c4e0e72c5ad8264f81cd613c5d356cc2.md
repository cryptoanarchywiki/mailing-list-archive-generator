# True.  However, as has been reiterated many times, NT is being marketed as a

As do I.  In fact, in a decision made prior to my joining my current employer,
the IS manager actually advocated security by obscurity, believing that NT was
so new that nobody would know the security flaws in it.  So our firewall is
an NT platform with a commercial firewall product on it.  Which limits our
functionality (we call up for support saying "this is what we want to do", and
they say "Oh, our Unix version will do that, but not our NT version".  Not to
mention, it's pretty bad when your firewall crashes out from under (leaving no
access, instead of open access, but it STILl interferes with getting work
done, especially since 90% of my work involves a remote site on the other side
of the firewall).
