Well, in the judge's defense, note that he used the word "perhaps" above. I 
like this judge, which (obviously) isn't something I can say about too many 
judges...I think he was just trying to sharpen our thoughts and arguments, 
and that he DOES agree with us on many, many things. His fears about the 
misuse of anonymity in a police state, for example, come from his personal 
experience in a former socialist paradise. I think (hope) that being exposed 
to "cypherpunk issues" by as many good thinkers as he was, in a relaxed, 
non-courtroom setting, has broadened his understanding of the many issues 
involved and will help "our" side immensely if these same issues ever do 
come before him.

I have decided, however, to cease my very enjoyable conversation with him 
about these issues, from now until after Judge Patel's Bernstein case has 
been decided and appealed, because of this very possibility. I am already 
concerned that an ambitious U.S. Attorney, using Alta Vista, could attempt 
to argue that "cypherpunk terrorists have been secretly trying to subtly 
influence Kozinski's thinking, and that therefore he should be removed from 
the case in favor of some judge who has no clue whatsoever about the 'Net, 
encryption, anonymous remailers, etc." [I am sure the argument wouldn't be 
put quite that way <g> but that's what the U.S. Attorney would mean.] There 
is now a judge with some idea of these issues who will IMNSHO probably be 
fair to "our" side. It is a rare opportunity, and I don't want to "blow it."
