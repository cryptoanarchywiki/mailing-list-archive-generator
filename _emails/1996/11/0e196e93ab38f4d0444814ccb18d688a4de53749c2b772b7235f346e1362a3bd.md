	I'm not happy with the barring of Vulis from the list: sure he was
a kook and he posted many ad-hominem messages*, but I feel a mini-FAQ would
deal with the matter better. Explain the background to his tantrums** and
explain how to filter out messages with various mail packages.

*	I think Vulis was really unfair to Tim May, even though I find myself
disagreeing strongly with what Tim has to say on some matters. At least Tim
has posted interesting, thought-provoking, crypto-related material.

**	Ok, so `tantrums' is an understatement...

	Derek Bell
