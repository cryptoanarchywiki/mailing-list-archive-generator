What weight can my opinion possibly have? This list is apparently
owned by a Mr. John Gilmore. If he's being censorous, that's bad,
but it is apparently within his means to execute said censorship.

Not to speak for the cypherpunks (we all know their reputation) but I 
should think the cypherpunks are savvy enough to know the subjectivity
of the term "on-topic".

Improving signal to noise is a laughable goal at a social event of
more than 100 people, why do people insist upon trying it on the net?
