I don't see how you can say this.  I was brought up by this wonderful system (U.S.)
to believe that censorship was necessarily non-violent.  It was only when I became
conscious of "Assassination as the Ultimate Form of Censorship" that I saw the
broader connections.

Seems to me you'd want to come up with different words for violent censorship instead,
but then again, as in the above paragraph, we already have those.
