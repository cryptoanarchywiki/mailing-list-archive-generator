   remailer@nowhere.com looks for "$$" as the first line of the message,

   or final destination).

   A bit annoying, yes, but I think this would go a long way towards 
   improving public relations. I don't see how it compromises security.

Neither do I.  I think it should use something like a line of dashes,
or maybe a C comment, though, rather than $$, to make it look
'prettier' for the eventual recipient, and clarify that it's not part
of the original message.

   What's wrong with this scheme? Other than the fact that all remailers 
   would have to change their software at the exact same moment. :-)

This is not true, of course.  Implement it in two stages.  First
recognise and strip the disclaimer, but don't prepend one, then, when
all remailers are doing this, start prepending information.
