In this case, the putative crime is "drug trafficking" or "possession,"
depending. One is still presumed innocent until proven guilty. To wit, the
state must prove its case.

I rather suspect that any prosecutors or defense lawyers on this list will
confirm that an LSD case is hardly a case of "guilty until proven innocent."
