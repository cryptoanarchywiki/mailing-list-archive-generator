Kinda sad when students can't even run an alta vista search for themselves.

I get pulled away from my usual work to do 4-5 technical interviews a 
week. I always throw in a few questions that no normal person should know 
the answers to. The ones that make up bullshit lose points, but the ones

about finding out get hired. I know I'll be able to count on them to deliver.
