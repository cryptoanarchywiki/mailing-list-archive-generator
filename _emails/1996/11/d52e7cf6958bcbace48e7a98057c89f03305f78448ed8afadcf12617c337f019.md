Indeed. IMNSHO, a self-governing property-owner (John) saw that the value of 
a piece of his property was being reduced by a person (Vulis, KOTM) camping 
there. He asked that person (many times, and no-doubt in a far more tolerant 
way than _any_ government has ever in history behaved with any rulebreaker) 
to "please use the latrine instead of the stream." The person not only 
refused, he said "you'll have to make me." The property owner made him. Most 
of the other campers, even those who (like me) choose to (and are able to) 
filter stream water before drinking it, breathed a sigh of relief.

John's action had about as much to do with "censorship" as AFDC has to do 
with "charity" or "compassion." The growing misuse of the word "censorship," 
especially here, is another symptom of the annoying educational work that 
Libertarians need to do, constantly, to fight the ever-encroaching Newspeak 
of those who do not believe in individual property rights, like the one 
(exclusion) that John exercised, only after much provocation. If you don't 
like it, tough shit. Go "buy your own campground" and start your own list, 
just like Perry is. But please don't mislabel John's action "Libertarian 
censorship."

One of the "legitimate concerns of law enforcement" seems to be
that I was born innocent until proven guilty and not the other
way around. -- me
