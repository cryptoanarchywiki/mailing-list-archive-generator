Even easier, take the Nazi Party. There name points towards the left wing of
the political spectrum, and yet their policies were left wing only for the
higher echelon, which makes them right wing, as their policies weren't for
the good of the people overall. Their decided tyranny of many spectrums of
the population was also deliberately right wing. And yet the regime was not
tyrannical according to the mould developed by Stalin. It was popular: it
was voted in, and it was supported by the majority of the people throughout
it's rule.

I think you have some decent points. But they are off topic in this list,
and also highly generalised. Such a dissentation is worthy of a thesis, not
a mere hundred or so words.

Yours Sincerely,

Benjamin Grosman
