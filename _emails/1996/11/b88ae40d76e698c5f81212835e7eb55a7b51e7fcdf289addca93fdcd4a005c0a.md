This is bullshit on several counts. First, censorship does not have to be
government-sponsored. Second, John Gilmore's dishonorable actions were
carried out in his official capacity as the list owner. That's how they're
different, e.g., from the dishonorable actions by the lying shyster Jim Ray.

This is bullshit. John Gilmore "panalized" me because he didn't like what
I was saying. First he tried to be sneaky about it, then he openly boasted
of his actions.

I agree. Moreover John Gilmore pulls plugs in an arbitrary and capricious
manner. He did not pull Timmy May's plug for personal attacks, non-crypto-
related rants, racial diatribes about "crazy Russians", religous attacks
on Mormons, and general ignorance and stupidity.
