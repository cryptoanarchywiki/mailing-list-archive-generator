I hope it is ready.  To quote from William Safire's 11/14/96 NYT column:

"Let's run a test.  "Information Technology and Political Control in
Singapore" is a paper just issued by Prof. Gary Rodan of Murdoch University
in Perth, Australia, distribued by Chalmers Johnson of the Japan Policy
Research Institute in Cardiff, Calif.  It's on this web site:
http://www.nmjc.ord/jpri/.

"If Lee blocks access, Singaporeans, try E-mail: cjohnson@ucsd.edu.  But be
careful, global business executives: the Architect of the New Century [Lee
Kuan Yew - wsf] may be monitoring everything you download."
