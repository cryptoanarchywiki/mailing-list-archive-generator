I am new to the list, and I was going to just sit and absorb for a few 
weeks, but....

Yes, the IQ scale that we generally refer to is based on age, ie. a 10 
year old and a 5 year old that perform equally will have different IQ scores.

However, it is now generally accepted in the psychology field that your 
brain can degrade or improve over time based on the stresses placed upon 
it.  Basically what this means is that your brain is like a muscle, and 
the more you use it, the higher your IQ becomes.

Contrary to popular armchair psychology, there is no significant evidence 
that IQ and age are inversely related.  In general, however, the older we 
get, the less we use our brain, and it becomes like a muscle that we no 
longer use.

The point: Yes, you can improve your brain, and you can take proactive 
steps to increase your IQ.
