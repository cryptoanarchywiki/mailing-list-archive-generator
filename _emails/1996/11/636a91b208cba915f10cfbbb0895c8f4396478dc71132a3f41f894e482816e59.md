From:	Vladimir Z. Nuri, in his Ancient Warrior mode:

I think many people need to learn a lesson that cyberspace doesn't
change certain basic realities, such as how important a dynamic leader
is in forward motion in any area. but they
will have plenty of opportunities to learn over the next few years and
decades. and I'll be snickering in the sidelines as long as they wonder
aloud why their realities are as they are and they find the deficiencies
therein inscrutable.
.....................................................

Oh, Nuri, you're so Morally Superior and so far above us, being more
"up" than anyone on inscrutable deficiencies.    I find it incredible to
realize that it will take *years* in cyberspace before I learn about the
immutability of basic realities (and maybe about the Incommensurability
of the Diagonal, too).  

Definitely it will be a very, very long time before I feel the need of
being led (around, by the nose?), in place of exercising self-control
and reasoned judgement.
