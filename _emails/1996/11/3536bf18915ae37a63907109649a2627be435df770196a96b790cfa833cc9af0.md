 "Intel Enters Encryption Market With HP For PCMCIA Card "

 So far, HP is the only computer company offering the
 combination PCMCIA and smart card encryption hardware.

 VLSI and Tandem are developing an encryption chip for use 
 on a PCMCIA card. VLSI built the infamous Clipper chip 
 developed by the NSA that was shot down as a proposed 
 government standard after overwhelming industry opposition.

 In a separate development, National Semi, one of two suppliers 
 of the Fortessa encryption card, scaled back its government 
 encryption operations. Program delays, slim margins, and 
 contract disputes with the NSA disillusioned the chip maker.
