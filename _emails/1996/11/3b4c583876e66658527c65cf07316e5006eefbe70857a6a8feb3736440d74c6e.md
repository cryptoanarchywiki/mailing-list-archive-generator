Keep your secret key in your head.

Your plausible deniability has to get quite low before it will stand
up as "proof" in court.

Your real challenge is keeping your stego programs safe.  Boot
strapping a stegoed encrypted file system while leaving no stego code
lying around isn't that easy.

My specialty :-)

rc4 in C:

#define S,t=s[i],s[i]=s[j],s[j]=t /* rc4 key <file */
unsigned char s[256],i,j,t;main(c,v)char**v;{++v;while
(s[++i]=i);while(j+=s[i]+(*v)[i%strlen(*v)]S,++i);for(
j=0;c=~getchar();putchar(~c^s[t+=s[i]]))j+=s[++i]S;}

rc4 in perl:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -0777-- -export-a-crypto-system-sig -RC4-3-lines-PERL
@k=unpack('C*',pack('H*',shift));for(@t=@s=0..255){$y=($k[$_%@k]+$s[$x=$_
]+$y)%256;&S}$x=$y=0;for(unpack('C*',<>)){$x++;$y=($s[$x%=256]+$y)%256;
&S;print pack(C,$_^=$s[($s[$x]+$s[$y])%256])}sub S{@s[$x,$y]=@s[$y,$x]}

The other problem I see is that if you have a stego file system in an
audio file, your disk writes are going look strange.  The inaccuracy
of disk head placement, is going to ensure that someone with the know
how will be able to copy off the last dozen pieces of data you wrote.

If they are all the same data with the exception of the LSB, it's
goint to look fishy.  Solid state storage devices are better.
