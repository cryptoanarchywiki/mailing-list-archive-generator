Is there any law(s) that actully define encryption?

At it's very basics encryption is taking a group of 1's & 0's converting them into a different group of 1's & 0's and providing a mecanisim to change them back to the original group of 1's & 0's.

>From a legal standpoitnt how is PGP any different than PKZIP? How does the law make a diference between an "encryption" program and a "compression" program other than the fact that the encryption program is advertized as encryption and the compression program is advertized as compression?
