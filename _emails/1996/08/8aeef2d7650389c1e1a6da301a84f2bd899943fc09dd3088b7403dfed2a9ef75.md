Sorry about mangling quotes. :(
This was about a year and a half ago.
I can't remember the name of it,  but this chip fab industry mag was
talking about how the NSA was obtaining out side help in fabricating what
was at the time a type of ram that did processing off chip in parrallel.

If the chip was basically routing the problem to different sectors and
the same sectors of ram did their own processing on different parts of the 
same problem how many powers of processing time would this increase the 
same amount of acerage?* 

* NSA term for processing. 

Side note: Wired just recently talked about IRAM or Intelligent ram, and 
how it seems to be the future of high speed computation.
PGP encrypted mail preferred.  
E-Mail me for my key.
