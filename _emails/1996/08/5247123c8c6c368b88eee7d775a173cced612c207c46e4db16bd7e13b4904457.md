Sounds like a market niche to me...people at the border could sell the
plate numbers (and even full DMV searches) of cars they see....maybe with a
higher price paid for "real-time quotes," and a lower price paid for
"15-minute-delayed quotes." Just like the stock market.

By the way, I'm watching MSNBC and they're engaging in a fretfest about
this Oregon situation, with calls for "regulating the Internet."

"There is no good reason for this to be on the Internet." is one line I
heard. (If the stuff is legal to own, and is "public information," just
what exception to the First Amendment could be used to bar publishing?)

BTW, this latest issue is similar to the flap several years ago over Lotus'
plan to sell to the public a CD-ROM of zipcodes and whatnot. (I think it
was called "Lotus Neighborhoods.") So-called "privacy activists" raised a
hue and cry and the plan was cancelled. Of course, corporations and other
such interest groups can get the data, so not much was accomplished. Many
of us thought it was a blow to real privacy issues.

The Ostrich Security Principle: "It is more important to have the
_illusion_ of privacy than to have real privacy."
