Are you jealous, Tim )fart)? You're just a senile old fart, not worth my
spittle. I make you feel better I'll put (fart) after you stupid name. Shit.

Senile Tim May (fart) exposes himself as a liar by attributing to me shit
I've never said (Pidor Vorobiev's forgeries). Please stop polluting this
mailing list with your lies and personal attacks.

It's been many years since Tim May (spit) has been to college, hasn't it?
I don't blackmail my students into doing the work they don't want to do
by blackmailing them with grades. When I taught comp.sec., I said from the
start that everyone gets an A, and I trust tgen to be motivated enough to
read everything I _suggest_ they read. And they all did a great job and
earn3d their A's.

Senile Tim May (fart) is a fucking statist asshole.

Fuck you and fuck your criminal Arm*nian grandparents.
