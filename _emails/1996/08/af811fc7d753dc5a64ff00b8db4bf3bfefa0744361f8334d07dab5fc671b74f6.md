It is not likely to be a "break-in." Rather, the Big Three credit reporting
agencies, Transunion, TRW Credit, and Equifax, routinely are complicit in
creating false credit histories as part of the "legends" of agents, persons
in the Federal Witness Security Program, etc.

(Do you not think Equifax would "notice" a new identity which popped into
existence in 1995, complete with a 10-year credit history, a high school
diploma, a record of past employment, etc.? There is a good reason these
companies have close ties with the TLAs in the D.C. area...where, perhaps
coincidentally, they have major offices.)

My Cyphernomicon has more information about the roles the credit agencies
have played in creating false identities and maintaining their cover, and
the role of FinCEN and its ties to these nominally-private agencies.

What this report about Net-n-Yahoo has confirmed is his almost certain role
as an agent of the U.S. intelligence agencies. His role in the Pollard case
is likely to come out in the next few months.

(Look for legislation from Feinswine and others making it a felony to
disclose Social Security numbers....)
