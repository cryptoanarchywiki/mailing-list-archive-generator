Foreign diplomacy was one of the exceptions.

Algol wasn't, since it's designed to describe algorithms to humans,
even though it's additionally useful for diplomatic relations with
our Mechanical Companions.  (Actually, they are allowed to use it
for teaching purposes, or if really necessary for National Security,
and the Bureau of the Census can use it to help count people.)

putting "E Pluribus Unum" on the coinage....

`(2) OFFICIAL BUSINESS- The term `official business' means governmental actions,

informational materials, but
