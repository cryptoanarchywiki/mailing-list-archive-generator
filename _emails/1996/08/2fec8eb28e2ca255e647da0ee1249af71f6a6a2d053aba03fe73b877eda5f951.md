  Actually, a system like this is in place for toll collection in and 
around New York City, and on the New York State Thruway (a toll road 
that runs from NYC to Buffalo). It's called EZ-Pass, and involves 
some sort of programmed radio device that's scanned by the toll booth 
as you pass through. It can even automatically debit your VISA 
account. I am not aware of what representations, if any, they've made 
about the privacy of the data.

  An interesting economic point is that for the NYC bridges and 
tunnels, at least, EZ-Pass is now the only way to get discounted 
fares. The toll is $3.50 per bridge crossing. It used to be that they 
sold tokens, and if you bought a roll of tokens you'd get a 
discounted rate. Now they no longer sell the tokens in bulk, but the 
same discount is applied if you use the EZ-Pass system. The anonymous 
transaction is now the more costly one.
