I picked this up on Marsha Woodbury's jokes list (not all are fiction!):

>>Two members of the British Lothian and Borders traffic police were out on
>>the Berwickshire moors with a radar gun recently, happily engaged in
>>apprehending speeding motorists, when their equipment suddenly
>>locked-up completely with an unexpected reading of well over 300 mph.
>>
>>The mystery was explained seconds later as a low flying Harrier hurtled
>>over their heads. The boys in blue, upset at the damage to their radar
>>gun, put in a complaint to the RAF, but were somewhat chastened
when the RAF >>pointed out that the damage might well have been more severe.
>>
>>It seems that the Harrier's target-seeker had locked onto the 'enemy'
>>radar and triggered an automatic retaliatory air-to-surface missile attack.
>>Luckily, the Harrier was operating unarmed.
>>
>>Otherwise... "Gee Officer, sorry about your patrol car........"
