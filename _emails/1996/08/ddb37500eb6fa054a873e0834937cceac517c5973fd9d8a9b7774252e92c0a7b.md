The thing is that most people who are into this stuff would probably 
view VRML graphics as too primitive to hold their interest for the 
sake of "stimulation."  I would suspect that the people who would end 
up getting involved in putting Hillary/Evangelista in, ummm, 
compromising positions would probably do it for the humor value (not 
that the censor mongers won't have a fit over this anyway).  When 
your CPU becomes the bottleneck in net connections and not the actual 
bandwidth, *then* some people might decide to spend the time 
rendering such things.  However, w/ the state of things today I have 
yet to see a totally realistic looking rendering.  You can usually 
tell a photo from a rendering.

I suppose slander would be some recourse, or you could copyright your 
likeness and use copyright violations as well.  Many TV/Movie stars 
do this.
