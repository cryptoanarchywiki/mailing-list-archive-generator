After reading Mr. Holt's announcement and the subsequent replies on 
the list I decided to send him a polite off-list reply.  In it I 
briefly reiterated the argument that knowing how a lock mechanism 
work does not make the lock insecure; furthermore, it makes it more 
secure.

I then stated, in all caps, that not knowing the algorhythm is 
inherently insecure.  I stated that he should not be surprised when 
encryption activists bristle at the knowingly (or otherwise) 
techniques which pander to a crypto-ignorant populace.  
I requested no reply and completed with a few quotes from the "Snake Oil" 
chapter of the PGP documention.  I told him to ask himself if he felt
that the marketing techniques he was using fit the profile contained 
therein.

While not the friendliest of e-mails, I was certainly civil and 
sincerely hoped to prod Mr. Holt to consider these issues and assess 
his approach.

His reply was so rediculous that I decided to post it to the list 
with my own reply attached.  Chuckle at will.

You really know nothing at all about encryption.  At least I KNOW 
what I'm getting.  I know what the RSA algorhythm is.  I know it has 
been tested and studied.  Whether or not it was "ripped off" depends 
on whether or not you're related to RSA data security in some way.  
It's a copyright issue and has nothing whatsoever to do with the 
technology itself.  All the algorhythms used in the PGP package were 
written by others; what does that have to do with anything?

What does the price of the software have to do with anything?  If I 
spent money on it does that make it any more secure?  I would gladly 
spend money on secure encryption technology.  I, for one, would like 
to be comfortable that it's money well-spent.

Your defenses are those of one who has nothing to defend.  Crying 
"libel" and making empty statements such as the above are actions 
that divert attention from the truth; that your product is most 
likely worthless crap.  Furthermore, you really don't know for 
yourself whether or not this is true.

Happy selling.
