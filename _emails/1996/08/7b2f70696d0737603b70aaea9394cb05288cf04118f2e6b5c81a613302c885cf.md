It probably will. But people like being degenerates.

Another interesting issue for privacy is setting the granularity of the
information. If you know that only a few people have visited site A, and
you tell the distributing service that you like site A, then the rating
service has the potential to become a way to track people (to a certain
margin of error). Were I running such a service, I wouldn't hand out
information until enough static had accumulated to provide anonymity.
