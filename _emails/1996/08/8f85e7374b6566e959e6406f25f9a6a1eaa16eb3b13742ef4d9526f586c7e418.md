You are absolutely right here. I should have asked: 'how can you prove that *US workers* aren't worse off' instead of 'how can you prove that *the US* isn't worse off'. I abbreviated my question because I had repeated it already so often. My misstake.
	You seem to be saying that the US workers are worse off when American capital is invested abroad (something that most of the other posters have denied), but that American consumers and investors are better off, and that it's impossible to say what the overall effects on the standard of living of American citizens will be because you can't add and substract values of different people. This sounds reasonable (and indeed very Austrian), and you could be right, though I think there exists a proof that the overall effects on the standard of living of American citizens of investing abroad is positive. See one of my recent posts on the subject.
