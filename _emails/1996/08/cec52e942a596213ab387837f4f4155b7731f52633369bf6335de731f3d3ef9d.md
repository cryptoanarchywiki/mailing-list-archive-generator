  I personally found the page to be offensive and disagree highly with the
person having "good taste".
  Following the premise that another posted to this list, there were ways of
focusing on opposing the CDA without insulting women and/or minorities.  I
also agree that this act is going to backfire by giving the DOJ fodder when
the case reaches the Supreme Court.
  IMO, it was patently obvious that it was a kid or kids that did it who
gave no substantial thought on the consequences of his/their act.
