You've been hanging out with those subversive Canadians again,
haven't you?  It's covered by the Terrorism Exception to the 4th Amendment.*

Do you mean legally?  :-)
Some combination of laws and court decisions has established that
cordless phones don't provide an expectation of privacy,
but cellular phones do, so eavesdropping on cellular phones
requires wiretapping authorization (whether a warrant, FISA permission,
or whatever other procedures constitute Due Process.)
