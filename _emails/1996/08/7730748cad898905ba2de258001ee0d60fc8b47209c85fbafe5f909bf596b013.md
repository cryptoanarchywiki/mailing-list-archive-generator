The domain in the server's certificate will not match the domain on the url,
i.e. the certificate will say www.eve.com and the url will be
www.megafoobarcorp.com.  Netscape does and should complain about this,
and that particular warning cannot be turned off.  Now it is quite possible
that the user will ignore the warning or not fully understand it, and 
proceed, but if the user pays attention to those sort of warnings, the
switch will be detected.

Now maybe if you got a certificate for a very similar domain name, the user
might be more likely to ignore the warning.
