  A slight correction. They are imposing a 6% tax on the Gross receipts of
all Internet Providers who have customers in Tacoma. This includes AOL,
Compu$erve, and my local favorites - aa.net and eskimo.com

  Tacoma also wants these companies to buy a $72 a year business license.
There are the beginnings of an uprising against this, the mayor has called
for it to be repealed, but the City Council (In all of its bureaucratic
wisdom) wants to wait and see what happens. There's a public meeting on the
27th of August.

  Plus the fact that the taxation of these services (well, IMHO all
taxation is ...) is not based on services provided to the business by the
city. My provider is located in seattle, and has lines in Tacoma. They use
no Tacoma services, and yet Tacoma says that the provider owes them money.

  Its just another grab for money by the simple minded bureaucrats.
Hopefully we can toss some more of these jokers out of office the next
election.
