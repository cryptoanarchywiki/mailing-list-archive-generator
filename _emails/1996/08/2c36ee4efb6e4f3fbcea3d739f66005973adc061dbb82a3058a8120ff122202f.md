   8-26-96. EeTi: 
 
   "Unix gives hackers a crack at systems." 
 
      Las Vegas: Many of the hacking elite were on the 
      Internet long before the World Wide Web was a gleam in 
      the eye of inventor Tim Berners Lee. And these folks 
      know the best-kept secret of gaining access to-and 
      control of-someone else's electronic property: Unix. 
 
      An expert underground Web cracker who goes by the 
      handle +ORC noted with apparent glee: "With each 
      company that connects to the Net, new frontiers are 
      created for crackers to explore." 
 
      Indeed, even as many old-line hackers of the sort who 
      gathered here recently for the DefCon convention go 
      legit, some starting cyber-security companies of their 
      own, Internet-security experts look with trepidation 
      to the next, more threatening wave of cybercrime. 
 
      Perhaps the legendary hacker group l0pht is the best 
      example of the thin line between cybercriminal and 
      corporate comer. Several members spoke at DefCon, 
      notably Death Vegetable, administrator of the Cult of 
      the Dead Cow; and Mudge, the brilliant encryption 
      cracker who devised the S/Key Cracker's Toolkit and 
      posted it on the Net, much to the chagrin of Bellcore, 
      S/Key's owners.
