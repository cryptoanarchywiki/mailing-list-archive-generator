But there are no "costs" to be distributed. The government already taxed
the corporation once, at 40-50%, and even taxed the gain due solely to
devaluation to the currency (inflation), so all I am asking is that I not
be taxed again. Of course, they will likely do so anyway. So I'm saying I
probably won't sell assets I might otherwise have sold (not surprisingly,
some folks even want unsold assets taxed).

For the record, I paid a *lot* of taxes this year, much more (by a factor
of several) than I putatively received in benefits.
