One of the best comments I have seen (from another list) was:

"These are the people who want us to escrow our encryption keys with them
and yet they can't protect their own web site."

I think this can be used as a very valid example as to why they are
untrustworthy to be in charge of keeping anything private and/or protected,
let alone private encryption keys.
