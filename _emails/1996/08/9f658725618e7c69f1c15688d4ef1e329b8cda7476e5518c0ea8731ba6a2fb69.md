No big deal, as I see it.

The only reason the AOL outage made the headlines is because of market
share. My own local ISP goes out at times, sometimes for more than a day.
And judging by the comments of others here (e.g, "my connection has been
flaky," "My ISP was down for the past few days," "Could someone mail me the
last 3 days worth of traffic?"), I suspect this is common.

Market share is what generates headlines.
