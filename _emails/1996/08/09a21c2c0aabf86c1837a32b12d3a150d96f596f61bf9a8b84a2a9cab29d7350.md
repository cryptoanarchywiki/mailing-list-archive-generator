The Internet just makes it more efficient.  The way it used to
work, is that Northern California service station attendants
would look in Oregon cars they were servicing for registration
papers or get other indications (from drivers license, checks, 
credit card imprints or social engineering) the name and/or 
address of the traveler. This information was then sent to
accomplices in Oregon for "processing."  This is an OLD story.
