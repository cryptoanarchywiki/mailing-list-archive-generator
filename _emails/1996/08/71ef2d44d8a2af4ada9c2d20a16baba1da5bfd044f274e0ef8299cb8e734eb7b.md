Hi Anne, nice to see you again. :-)

I was involved in the setup of the DoubleClick system while contracting
out to Poppe Tyson, who are partnered with them and located in the same
building. Poppe Tyson hosts many web sites for their advertising accounts.

When I was there, they were carrying T. Rowe Price; Chrysler; Pepsi; 
Siemens; Valvoline; LensCrafters; and the list goes on. Because the two
networks are located in the same building and the two firms working
together, it is very possible for DoubleClick to be able to scan the sites 
that poppe.com supports.
