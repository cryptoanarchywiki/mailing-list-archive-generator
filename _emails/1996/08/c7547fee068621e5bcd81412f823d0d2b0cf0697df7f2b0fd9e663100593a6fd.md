I don't see what the FBI is complaining about. Child pornography traded
on the net makes produces of child pornography incredibly easy to
locate. The child porn peddlers and consumers caught on the network are
usually soft, chewy and coperative, responding well to all manner of
threats and inducements. Further the piracy in child pornography tends
to create a buyers market, drives prices down substantially, reducing
the incentive to produce original material at all.
