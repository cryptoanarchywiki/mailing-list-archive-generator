A couple of weeks ago Hal mentioned Ross Anderson's Eternity
Service paper (URL: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk:80/users/rja14/#Lib).

As Hal described it at the time:

>The goal of the Eternity service is to make published information
>permanently and ineradicably available, despite efforts on the part of
>powerful attackers to destroy it.  The attack model explicitly
>includes governments.  This has obvious relevance to current
>controversies involving copyright, trade secrets, etc.

[. . . .]

>Anderson's basic concept is of a network of storage servers in widely
>scattered jurisdictions.  He uses cryptography so that although the
>servers store data, no single computer knows exactly what is stored in
>the encrypted files it holds.  Keys to the data are spread across the
>network using secret sharing techniques, with mutual cooperation among
>the servers being necessary to decrypt files.  (I believe the files
>themselves are redundantly stored on individual servers, but they are
>encrypted with keys which are split.)  Anonymous communications are
>used among the network of computers to reply to requests, so that
>attackers can't tell which computer produced a requested document.

At the time I thought this sounds quite interesting and filed the 
information away for a time when I would have an opportunity to
get the paper and read it.  I finally created that opportunity
recently only to find the paper at the above URL in a format I have
a *lot* of difficulty reading.  I'm a little embarrassed to ask such a
thing, but does anyone know a location where this paper resides in
plain-vanilla ASCII?

Many thanks.
