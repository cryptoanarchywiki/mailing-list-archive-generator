Does anyone have any experimental information comparing an 
untamped high explosive with a pipe bomb?

A pipe bomb is a device for getting a decent explosion
out of a low explosive, such as gunpowder.

A low explosive combusts relatively slowly.  The purpose
of the pipe is to hold it together for long enough to get
decent pressure.

Homemade low explosives tend to be even more feeble 
than manufactured low explosives, because it is inadvisable
for amateurs to recorn their powder, with the result that
home made powders burn slow, whereas homemade high
explosives are just as effective as manufactured high 
explosives.

My theoretical expectation is that pipe bombs would be 
very ineffectual when compared to high explosives, 
especially using home made powders.

Note that very large pipe bombs can be made by using 
propane cylinders or compressed gas cylinders in 
place of pipes.
