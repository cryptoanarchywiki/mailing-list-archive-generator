Simple.  In a market economy, with or without inflation, relative
prices are constantly changing in response to changes in supply 
and demand, and as capital is moved among investments to maximize
return.  In an inflationary environment the result is that while
all (or at least most) prices are rising, some will rise faster
than others in the short term.  Q.E.D.

Only to someone who does not understand economics.  A counter
example is the unregulated computer industry.  Prices rise very
little, if at all, and even undergo price deflation at times.

Sorry, this is incorrect.  (We call that an analogy.)  The 
definition of "straw man" I used came directly from the 
dictionary.  Now you may have a "personal" definition, but I
doubt it's widely shared.  (Ref., my Lewis Carrol quote in my
exchange with the pomey.)

If there are no other questions, class is dismissed.
