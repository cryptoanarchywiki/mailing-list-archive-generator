Speaking of AT+T, as I recall one of the incidents which preceded the 
introduction of Clipper was the news that AT+T was going to introduce an 
encrypted telephone using DES as the encryption algorithm.  According to the 
story, AT+T was "bought off" by the US government.   I haven't looked into 
that for a couple of years, but if we're looking for co-conspirators that 
would be a good place to start.  

Also:  Clipper was fabbed by VLSI Technology.  A few pointed inquiries might 
work wonders here.
