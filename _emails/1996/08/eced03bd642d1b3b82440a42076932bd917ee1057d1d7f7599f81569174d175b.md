A system admin had a brain freeze over the weekend and was
resubmitting some messages that bounced to a broken news
server on Thursday. Some of the messages were redirected
back to their originating mailing list.

I have no idea why the message bodies were "suppressed."

I can't tell when the messages were actually resent since
the news gateway software rewrites the Date: field of the
incoming messages.

In any event, I don't believe anything sinister or intentional
was done.
