I think, a 'collection of words', especially when exchanged on a personal level should be regarded as 'intellectual property' and thus should be protected from outsiders.
The technical means of physically creating (i.e. writing) and transmitting the words are secondary for above all they are thoughts, that are meant to be exchanged from one mind to another. It is too natural a thing to be subjected to invasion.
