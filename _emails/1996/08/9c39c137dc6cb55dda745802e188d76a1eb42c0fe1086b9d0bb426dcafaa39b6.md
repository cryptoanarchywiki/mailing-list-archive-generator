Actually, my comment was exactly the opposite. You may not be aware of what goes
on with your neighbour to the north, but the province of Quebec currently has a
government whose stated intention is independence from Canada. 

The recent public referendum for a mandate to seceed was defeated by a very
small margin: 51% to 49% with 95% voter turnout.

"Her majesty's loyal opposition" in the parliament (the Bloq Quebecois) has the
same raison d'etre - Independence of Quebec from Canada.

I do not believe that freedom of speech in the U.S.A. extends to actively
agitating for secession or the overthrow of the federal government.
