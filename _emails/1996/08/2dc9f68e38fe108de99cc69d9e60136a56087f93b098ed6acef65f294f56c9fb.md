! And then Lot said, "I have some mighty fine young virgin daughters. Why
! don't you boys just come on in and fuck them right here in my house - I'll
! just watch!"....Later, up in the mountains, the younger daughter said:
! "Dad's getting old. I say we should fuck him before he's too old to fuck."
! So the two daughters got him drunk and screwed him all that night. Sure
! enough, Dad got them pregnant, and had an incestuous bastard son....Onan
! really hated the idea of doing his brother's wife and getting her pregnant
! while his brother got all the credit, so he pulled out before he
! came....Remember, it's not a good idea to have sex with your sister, your
! brother, your parents, your pet dog, or the farm animals, unless of course
! God tells you to. [excerpts from the Old Testament, Modern Vernacular
