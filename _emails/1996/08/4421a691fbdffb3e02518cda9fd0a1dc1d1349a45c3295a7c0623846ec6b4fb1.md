Unicorn, please try to take a minute to think before hitting that send
key.

You infer that a product is critically flawed without even trying it ?
There are quite a few members of this list who are using Pronto Secure
and will testify to the contrary.
See http://www.commtouch.com/testers.htm for a list of people who take
the trouble to try out a product before venturing an opinion.

Agreed that feedback from external testers is a good deal for
developers. It is also not a bad deal for evaluators, they get a free
copy of a product which in the case of Pronto Secure many find useful
(as witnessed by x-mailer headers on c'punk traffic). Testers also get
an opportunity to contribute neat feature ideas which helps propagate
secure messaging to the masses.

Unicorn, you are invited to whitewash my fence :)
