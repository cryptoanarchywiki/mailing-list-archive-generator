FINALLY, SOFTWARE THAT COMPLETELY ENSURES THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF 
PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY/CLIENT INFORMATION OVER THE INTERNET!

If you are at all concerned about the security of documents that 
your firm regularly sends via e-mail, or about the confidentiality, 
integrity and size of documents currently affecting your 
transmission speeds, please read the following..........

SafE Mail=AE is a new, proprietary software product that provides 
information security through encryption, compression, error 
correction, INTERNET compatibility and, it is compatible with ANY 
electronic mailing system. 

Comparisons of SafE Mail's encryption against leading competitors 
revealed that SafE Mail's encryption key was longer and compression 
greater than any similar product available today and that SafE Mail 
offers error correction (also not available with similar products) 
of up to 30% which can typically occur during transmissions.  SafE 
Mail's proprietary technology is based on the concepts of private, 
public key and signature authentication and, it is supplied on a 
single diskette.  

SafE Mail utilizes a short 22 character public key (invulnerable to 
attack) which makes exchanging data secure and simple to do.  This 
information security software is the most secure and easiest to use 
on the market today. 

I have included some information that describes the features of 
SafE Mail I think will be of most interest to you.  If you would 
like more information, a copy of our "Frequently Asked Questions", 
or are interested in obtaining a nominal cost "demo" to evaluate 
the software yourself, please call us today. 

Thank you,
