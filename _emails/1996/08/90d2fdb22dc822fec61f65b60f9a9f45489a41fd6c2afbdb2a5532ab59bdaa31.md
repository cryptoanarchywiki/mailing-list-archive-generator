The problem with the debatre on datahavens is that it is
failing to account fo the fact that without the infrastructure
of law business is not possible.

What taxbomber offers is false identification papers. He does
not simply offer fake passports but a whole raft of fake
credentials. If I am offering free services to accredited 
journalists and someone comes along with a taxbomber supplied
illegitimate press card and obtains free services that is fraud.

Just because a policy for supplying credentials is not fully
effective does not make it legitimate for an individual to 
make a business out of helping people to criminally exploit its
flaws.


Similarly libertarian wet dreams about oil rigs chock full of
commandos armed to the teeth with machine guns will remain dreams.
Fact is that under international law an oil rig is regarded 
as a ship and as such has to be acredited by some recognised
nation. Diplomatic recoginition is not a trivial matter.
Countries only provide recoginition if it is in their interests
and critically it is _governments_ that are recognised.

A declaration of independence by the inhabitants of an oil rig
would be treated in a similar fashion to the Montana freemen.
If the intention was to make international fraud easier then
definitely expect the same treatment.
