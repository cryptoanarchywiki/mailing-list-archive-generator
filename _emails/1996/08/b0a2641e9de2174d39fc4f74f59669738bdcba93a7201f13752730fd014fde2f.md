Thats what those old records are for. (no offense)

        If they are sueing MTV why not other TV stations....

        If I was going to sue someone for not doing my homework i would sue
Jarkko Oikarinen, the creator of IRC. I just think that this is really
        pathetic.... but then again I am famous for my flame replys in the past.
        
        Why not make the school pay MTV for keeping kids away from there station
        while they are doing homework (hehehe)

        FYI i thought this reply out.
