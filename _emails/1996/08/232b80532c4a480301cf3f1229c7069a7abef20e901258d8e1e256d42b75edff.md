	Umm... yes, it's called free speech. While organizational ability
might be a matter for concern, somehow I doubt that having them on the net
will do any real damage... being on a computer that mine is connected to hardly
puts them "in [my] home," even if my computer at home were connected to a phone
line. Bloody law enforcement paranoids...
