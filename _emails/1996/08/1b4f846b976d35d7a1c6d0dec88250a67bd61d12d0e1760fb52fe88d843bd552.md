This is impractical for one reason.  In most cases it will show the address
of the service provider, but will report nothing beyond that.  You will just
see which IP address you were assigned when you logged on.  The logs would
be true is some sense, flase in some sense and meaningless in most sense.

This brings up an interesting point.  Is it poosible to obtain the list of
all the individuals/corporations that have purchaced the list of DMV
information and post *THAT* information to the net.  I think that people
would be surprised just who uses that information and for what...
