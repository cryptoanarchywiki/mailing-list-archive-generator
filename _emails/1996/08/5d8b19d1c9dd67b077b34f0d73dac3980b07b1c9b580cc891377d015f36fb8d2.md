Here's my key, your honor.  I used a one-time pad to do the encryption.  As
you can plainly see, the encrypted file that the prosecution made such a big
deal about contains nothing but some of my favorite verses from the King James
Bible.  You shouldn't infer anything from the fact that another key would
make the file contain the evil stuff that was alleged (even though it is a bit
strange that the last verse ends in the middle of a word).

Frank Stuart              | when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
