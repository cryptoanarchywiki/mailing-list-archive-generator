Now I don't claim to be a naval defence expert, But from what 
I do read of the dogeared copies of Jane's Defence Weekly, 
Would be to install three or four Phalanx Close-In Weapons 
Systems, The Phalanx is a radar guided 20mm Gatling gun spraying 
out 4500 rpm at a range of 1600 yards.  Quite perfect for downing 
a privately owned MiG-21, Exocet missles from pissed off French 
gunboats for storing Chirac's medical records and maybe keeping 
those pesky mercenaries from skydiving onboard.

Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, there are literally all 
sorts of firepower for sale in the open markets, trolling in 
the alt.business newsgroups I have been able to find quite 
a few MiG's for sale, and there's a fellow in Finland that 
has a former Soviet 'Julliet Class' Diesel-Electric submarine 
and I understand he's taking offers.
 
Now this is a completely doable concept, and likely more realistic
than the Oceania project, Unfortunatly like all things, it comes
down to how much money you want to throw at it, I remember how 
many us on this list balked at Vince charging $500.00 for one
year on a Unix Shell account, I wonder what the market would 
bear for both a technologically and physically secure datahaven?
