Well,

I could.

Estimated prices (USD) - If I have at least 300 "certain" buyers:

CDROM with 2-color label and jewel-case: USD 13.-
Shipment US:                             USD  3.- (swiss mail sucks!)   
Shipment Europe:                         USD  2.-

Since the origin of those CD's is Switzerland, no ITAR would apply.

If you're interested (at least 300 of you), mail me. 
Subject line: CryptoCD
Anonymous guys ignored (but data handled confidentially and encrypted on my 
machine).
If you want more than one, send more than one mail (but with a different 
body, so I can kill duplicated mails).
Once I get more than 300 requests, I'll start putting it together and have 
it mastered. At that point I will request a written order (fax or so). If 
anyone has a better idea on how to handle the stuff, mail me...
