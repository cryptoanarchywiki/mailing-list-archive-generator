I'm aware of the three main disk encryption programs SFS, SECDRV, and
SECDEV, but I need to find a solution that works with Windows 95 32bit
or Windows NT 4.0.

I'm currently using SFS 1.17 and Secure Drive under Win-95, but am
unable to continue to work in dos compatability mode due to severe
performance hits.  I am open to commercial products that have passed
peer review, but know of none.

If anyone could suggest a solution (outside of switching OS's), I
would be *most* gratefull.

Please respond to the list, as I am a subscriber under another
account.

Tried secdev? Edgar Swank (author of secdrv) recently posted
that secdev (note, not secdrv) does, in fact, uses 32 bit disk 
access with win95. Win95 reports that the secure device is in 
compatibility mode, but the host disk (and therefore the secure 
volume file) is being accessed in 32 bit (disk) mode. Not sure 
what issues there are with '32 bit FILE access' mode here. 

Sounds worth a try though. Please post the results if 
you try this.
