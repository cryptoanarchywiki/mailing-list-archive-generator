  I guess the point I was trying to make all along is this; Is a data haven
going to be a security through obscurity operation?  This is what the Swiss
have with secret bank accounts, etc.  Or will it be an operation where the
operator of the system lets whatever on, and hopes he won't get prosecuted.
In Island in the Net, the haven were physical.  The authorities got to them
eventually.  Vince's system is restricted by physical laws.  There will
always be a finite array of information he can present without putting the
whole operation on the line.
  Is he still a data haven then?  I believe so.  But through creative
diplomacy he could balance the powers that bind him.  How well he or anyone
else does this is the key to the range of information presented.
