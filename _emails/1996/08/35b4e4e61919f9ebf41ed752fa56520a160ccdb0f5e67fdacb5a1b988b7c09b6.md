Erm. Tim seems to be writing about how it doesn't make much sense to give
driver's licenses to illegal aliens and Stephen is writing about how Arizona
is planning to not give driver's licenses to legal aliens. Which would
appear to be talking at crosspurposes.

I'm a PLRA in the USA, so it does matter somewhat to me that i might be unable
to get a driver's license in a country i could legally reside in because i'm
not a citizen of that country. Especially if that country won't let me drive
for extended periods of time on a driver's license issued elsewhere.

If the State won't give me official documents (as a legal alien), what's the
point of being classified as a legal alien? (Except more exciting
interrogations every time i cross the border?)

Tim's opinions on illegal immigrants, good, but don't really apply so much
to PLRAs (who cannot vote, but can pay taxes and be drafted). [Which is,
i think, what Stephen was writing about in the first place.]
