I'm talking about the San Diego Union-Tribune, the paper that posted huge
billboard welcoming the RNC around the area, the paper that paid for the
biggest fireworks display ever west of the miss, the paper that had a
6-20 page RNC insert daily, the paper that "spammed" the opinions page
with pro-RNC articles.  Are we starting to see what's it like? By the
end, I was something like "I don't care if Bob Dole gets raped to death
by a donkey, I don't want to hear about it!"
