I can't find the exact quote, but Will Rogers quipped that every
time Congress made a law, it was a joke.  And every time Congress
made a joke it was a law.  The town near Morton Grove was not
making a real requirement that every household have a gun, they
were just making a joke at Morton Grove's expense.  In addition
to the "exceptions," there was no penalty for violation of the
law, thus making sure it was unenforceable.  It was not a case
of "pro-gun fascism" but of rough American political humor.  At
the very least it kept the city council out of more serious 
mischief.
