For anybody with interest in this happening in the U.S., please note that
such a practice (cameras and speed tracking devices, resulting in tickets 
being sent to the offending party) has been talked about, in somewhat 
closed circles, for years.  A couple of years ago, 2600 Magazine ran an 
article listing most of the intersections with said devices.  You can 
probably find it in their web page's index of back issues to pick it up.
(http://www.2600.com).

ObCrypto: Has anyone had any experience working with the Sidewinder 
Firewall and encryption and/or S/key or SecurID?  What are drawbacks with 
using DESlogin with a firewall?  or any encrypted transmissions for that 
matter?  Is there anyway to bypass the obvious (sniffing).

Thanks :)
