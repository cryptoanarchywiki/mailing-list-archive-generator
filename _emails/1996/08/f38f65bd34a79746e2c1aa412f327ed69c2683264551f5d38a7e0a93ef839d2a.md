Is the BBS PRNG covered by any patents anywhere? How about the
probabilistic encryption public-key cryptosystem?

If anyone has a BBS PRNG working on a 486 could they please send me
a the clock frequency and bytes/sec they can generate for some
common moduli: 512, 1024, and 2048, say. I am close to having
an implementation which will run at 500 bytes/sec on a 486 DX/2
with a 1024 bit modulus and am not sure if that is competitively
fast or not.
