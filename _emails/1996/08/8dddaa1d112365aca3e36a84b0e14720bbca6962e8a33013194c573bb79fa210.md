The server is one which interoperates correctly with Netscape and my
own routines.  It does strike me that this change is potentially the source of 
the bug.  However, to have a "locked" symbol on the bottom right hand
of the display would indicate to me as a user that a secure session has 
occurred.

For SSL devotees the records sent are:

1.  Client hello (from the client)
2.  Server hello (from the server).
3.  Plaintext data packaged up in SSL records from the client.
4.  The client then accepts plaintext data packaged up in SSL records.

SERVER_VERSION_MSB and
SERVER_VERSION_LSB 
indicate version 2 of SSL.

I have not changed the code in any way to deal with version 3 of
SSL making I think the valid presumption that browsers using 3 and
2 should be able to cope with a server using 2.

I shall reboot my system, trace a bit of a session and post that.
