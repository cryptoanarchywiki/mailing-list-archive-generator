Famine and inadequate nourishment does weaken the stamina and 
survivability of individuals in the Third World, but the main problem is 
non-access to (what we consider to be) simple, basic medical modalities. 
Untold numbers of African babies die of not-very-virulent diseases, 
because they becomes fatally dehydrated. In the West, these babies 
revieve IV fluids which carries them over the critical period. In a 
village that is three days walk to a bus which takes 16 hours to get to a 
clinic that has IV needles and sterile fluids, the baby WILL die.
