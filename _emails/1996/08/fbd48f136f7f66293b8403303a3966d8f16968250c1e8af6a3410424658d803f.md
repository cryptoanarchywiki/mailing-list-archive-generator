If I lived closer to the nearest city I know of with "photo tickets,"
namely, Campbell, California (about 30 miles away, over the Hill into
Silicon Valley). I would probably make sure my license plate had some real
mud on it...just enough to link some letters or numbers together to make
them unreadable with a low res. photo.

Maybe we'll have barcoded license plates sooner than we think. Then all of
those speed cameras can also track our movements.

HOW TO MAKE A PIPE BOMB:
"Buy a section of metal water pipe 1/2 by 6 inches long, threaded on both
ends.  Buy two metal caps to fit.  These are standard items in hardware
stores.  Drill a 1/16th hole in the center of the pipe. This is easy with a
good drill bit. Hanson is a good brand to use.  Screw a metal cap tightly
on one end. Fill the pipe to within 1/2 inch of the top with black powder.
Do not pack the powder. Don't even tap the bottom of the pipe to make it
settle.  You want the powder loose.  For maximum explosive effect, you need
dry, fine powder sitting loose in a very rigid container." (more
information at http://sdcc13.ucsd.edu/~m1lopez/pipe.html, or by using
search engines)
