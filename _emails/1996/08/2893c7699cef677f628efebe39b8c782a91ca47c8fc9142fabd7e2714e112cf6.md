My apologies to everyone involved!

I fucked up!

There was a period of time between when I downloaded and when I installed.
The version I installed was not the one I installed from the secure site.
(I had thought I had not downloaded the 3.0b5 version for Linux, except for
the secure version.  It seems that I had downloaded it when the first
version of 3.0b5 came out, not the 3.0b5a version...)

Sorry again!
