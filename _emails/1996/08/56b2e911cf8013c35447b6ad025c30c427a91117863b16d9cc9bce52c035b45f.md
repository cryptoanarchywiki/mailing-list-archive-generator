I beleive the concern of Mr. Smith and my others concerning myself is that the methods used to "protect" us from such events are more harmfull than the initial threat.

It is all too often that a minor threat receives massive publicity in the press. Then politions jump in with knee-jerk reactions to add "new and improved" restrictions to ones liberties & give law-enforcement sweeping new powers, Consitution be damed. If you paied any attention to the Senate hearing after Oklahoma and TWA 800 you could such behaviour of our polititions even though such laws will not help 1% to prevent such acts in the future.

I think what we have here is the all to common practice of grouping all criminal activities under the heading of "terrorism".While this may be advantagious for the Federal Government to do so placing what was once the juristiction of the States into the hand of the Feds. It does make nice splashy headlines for the newsmedia so they can sell more newspapers. It has no place in a rational disscusion of the security issues of Computers, Networks, and the Internet.

If someone aquires personal information about myself and at worst steels all the money out of my bank account. That is a crime, it is theft, and their are plenty of laws on the books to handle such a crime. It is NOT terrorism. 

While I agree that there is potential for harm being caused by a sofisticated, well orginised, state sponcered terrorist orginization, I for one am not going to lose any sleep over it. Yes there is a "threat" but No the sky is not falling.

<SIGH> Pulling at ones hartstrings in such a debate only shows the wekness and emptyness of your argument. I am unaware of you location but between growing up in the MiddleEast & my service in the military I have seen my fair share of the "better" side of Man. You by no means have a monopoly on this.

Mr. Smith bring up a vailid point. It is one of perspective. Who you consider terrorist and who you consider heros depends on what side of an issue you stand. The American saw no problem with the 10's of thousands who died in the fire bombing of Dresdin or the Atomic Blasts over Japan. The populations Germany & Japan were supportive of their leadership in the murder of millions durring their campaines of expantion. Look at Ireland; if you are Prodistant or British the IRA are the terrorist while
if you are Catholic then it is the British & Prodistant that are the "terrorist". The Jews in Israel had no problem with blowing up the British but don't like it too much now that the Palisinians are doing the same thing to them.

The whole issue of "Terrorist" vs. "Freedom-Fighter" is one of perspective.

<SIGH> More unwarrented use of "acts of terror" and "terrorism". Unauthorised access to information is not an act of terror. PEROID. Someone looked at somthing they shouldn't have. that's it. Put that at the criminal level of a mistamener <sp?>. Could someone use that information for a more serious criminal act at some later point in time. Yes. Is this likely, eh mabye, mabye not. If it is illegal for me to carry a knife then I am only guilty of carring a knife I am not guilty of commiting
murder even though it is possiable for me to commit murder with a knife.

And what did you do after speaking the these "students"? As a concerned citizen did you bother to report this information to the State Department, FBI, Immigration? Or did you just walk away with all kinds of warm fuzzies because you got dirty talking to potential "terrorist".

Well you have artfully side-steped the issue with a rather self-indulgend tear jerker. The issue presented was that security by obsecurity DOES NOT WORK! If you are that conserned about stoping the dreaded "Cyberterrorest" then you should present your solutions in a open forum for peer review. Ofcource sense we are not part of your elite "counter-cyberterrorest" force I imagine that you do not consider anyone else your peer. Or could it be you inability to debate and defend your ideas in a
public forum with those who have more experiance and better comprehention of the security issues we face at the dawn of the 21st century.

Hiding away is closed groups disscussing solutions to "THE THREAT" where you are the only voice on security may be a big bost to your ego but does little to improve security on a significant scale.
