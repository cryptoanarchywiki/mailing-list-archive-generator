This message was in response to comments made by E. Allen Smith on my recent remarks on cyberterrorism.

Dear Mr. Smith:

Thank you for your perspectives.  Save for the irrelevant flaming, I appreciated your taking time.  
Following are my comments.
  
>>Terrorism to CyberTerrorism
>
>>   The face of terrorism is changing. While the motivations remain the
>>   same, we are now facing new and unfamiliar weapons. The intelligence
>>   systems, tactics, security procedures and equipment that were once
>>   expected to protect people, systems, and nations, are powerless
>>   against this new, and very devastating weapon. Moreover, the methods
>>   of counter-terrorism that our world's specialists have honed over the
>>   years are ineffectual against this enemy. Because, this enemy does not
>>   attack us with truckloads of explosives, nor with briefcases of Sarin
>>   gas, nor with dynamite strapped to the bodies of fanatics. This enemy
>>   attacks us with one's and zero's, at a place we are most vulnerable:
>>   the point at which the _physical _and _virtual _worlds converge. Let
>>   us first define theses two domains.
>
>	Ever since the dawn of technological civilization, we've been vulnerable
>to terrorism inflicted by those with technological knowledge and intelligence.
>Ever since someone discovered how to produce poisonous gases, we've been
>vulnerable to attacks such as those in the Japanese subways. Ever since the
>electrification of countries, we've been vulnerable to attacks on power
>production and distribution systems. Ever since most vehicles became
>petroleum-powered, we've been vulnerable to attacks on petroleum production and
>distribution systems. Ever since we found out how to cultivate anthrax, we've
>been vulnerable to any competent bacteriologist.

These are all different tools.  Some are simple to create and deploy, some are not.  While the definition 
of classical terrorism (and its motivations) remain the same, we must study each of these tools separately 
if we are to understand how to detect, prevent, and respond to the threats.

>	All the above is is Information Super-Highway hype.

Thank you for your opinion.

>
>>Achieving CyberTerrorist Goals
>
>>   So how does a CyberTerrorist achieve his mission? Like any terrorist,
>>   a CyberTerrorist actively exploits the goals of the target population
>>   in areas in which they take for granted.
>   
>>   There are three potential acts in CyberTerrorism at the point of
>>   convergence:
>>     * 1.Destruction;
>>     * 2.Alteration; and
>>     * 3.Acquisition and retransmission (these are a unit).

>the getting and distribution of, say, ITAR-restricted information - you do
>accuse crackers of complicity in "CyberTerrorism" by breaking military
>security) are not, properly speaking, terrorism; they are instead the
>distribution of information that should not be restricted.

You guessed incorrectly; I'm not talking ITAR.  Test yourself:  Can you think of any sensitive or personal 
information, that if exposed or utilized, could cause terror -- or destabilization?  If you can't, you are 
not trying; you should know more than most the value of privacy, whether it be military, corporate, or 
personal.

>One person's
>terrorist is another person's freedom fighter (I'd call both sides in
>Nicaragua's Sandanista-Contra conflict terrorists).

This nifty statement frequently comes from people who've never seen a child blown up, seen people 
disfigured, seen property damaged beyond all recognition.  Perhaps it is a safe place in your office, Mr. 
Smith, behind your terminal judging other's thoughts.  I don't have that luxury.  I've spent more than 
anyone's fair share of time going through rubble, identifying pieces of what were once people, and telling 
their families.

Freedom fighters who kill random and innocent victims are terrorists and cowards.  If you feel otherwise, 
Mr. Smith, perhaps it is time to step out into harm's way, and then perhaps you too will waken in the 
night with the images that haunt me.  *Then* you can talk to me about such matters.  Until then, stick to 
coding.

These require more than once person be involved.  Do not kid yourself, we are not dealing with stupid 
people here.  And bloody utter idiots we have a-plenty -- too many administrators more concerned with 
their balance sheets to provide the tools people like you need to build safe systems.  You'd be surprised 
of the amount of criminally-inadequate systems out there.  That's why it _is_ important that folks like 
you push the envelope to better the systems.  The goal here, Mr. Smith, is to put me out of business, not 
by flames, but by helping to build better systems.  I think we share that goal.

We are not concerned with engineers.  We are concerned with fanatics, and fanatics are fanatics whether 
they are engineers or gardeners.  Do not be so naive to believe that everyone shares the morals you have. 
Mr. Smith, there are people out there who want you dead, and will use all the techniques you pointed out 
above to accomplish their goal.  As I said before, technology is just another tool.

Agreed.

Whether you are right or wrong about what governments have locked away is not in my work area.  As I've 
said, my work is in fanatics, the disenfranchised, etc.  People are people, and some turn rogue.  It 
happens.  And people are purchased.  My work keeps me entrenched in such mire regularly.

You might be interested in the number of "students" attending our universities that have solid terrorism 
backgrounds.  The ones I spoke to made their purpose very clear.

Yes, there is a block of text missing.  If you have any interest, I can resend.

Exactly how is CyberTerrorism profitable? Certainly, it's

>before.It's more profitable since the cost of entry, and continued operations, are less.  In addition, access to 
financial resources (computer crime) is readily available.  And you don't lose someone after they've been 
blown up.

could not possibly be telling me that everything is locked down safely at this point.  Bottom line, if you 
can make it, someone can break it.  Always has been, always will be.

When I am not volunteering, my job is to make sure you can safely send out your emails without getting 
blown away or blown up.

this than encryption.  Take off the blinders, Mr. Smith: encyrption is just one little piece of this 
puzzle.  It comes down to psychology, far more than technology.  I appreciate your curiousity, your wish 
for totally open systems.  In a perfect world, or even a sane world, that would be ideal.  I would love 
society to be filled with people like you who believe in improving the state of the art, the pushing of 
the envelope, etc.

But you are not who I deal with every day.  Unfortunately, just because you don't see these folks, doesn't 
mean they are not there.  They are not the ones with cutesy handles and who send messages to usenets and 
such.  It's the people off the radar screen, the one's that know better than to go public.  I've spent way 
too much time with these nutcases, and I assure you, Mr. Smith, they are very real.

Whether or not you believe or understand that is frankly irrelevant to me or my work.  But hopefully this 
will open your eyes to the fact that this is not about evil governments, nor military spookery, nor 
commercialization, nor fear of crackers.  The next time I have to travel to a bomb site, and as I try and 
figure out what cause could justify the death of someone who just happens to be in the wrong place at the 
wrong time, I will not be thinking of you in your office lecturing me on the computer world.
