Rich is frothing again. Time to killfile him again. Note he contributes
nothing of substance except a vapid anti-Wired rant that has been done
better elsewhere, like www.howtired.com. (Personally, I don't even read
Wired much anymore. To each his own.)

As for UCB and the FBI threads, Rich is talking about back
fight-censorship discussions. He seems to think that I endorse every
message I forward to a mailing list. He is incorrect. (Rather, I offer the
information to the list, as Judge Sloviter took Olsen's testimony, "for
what it's worth.")

Back to Indonesia -- my column should have said the Indonesian military is
*trying* to ban the mailing list from the country. They haven't succeeded
yet. Time will tell.

I have more information on Indonesia at http://www2.eff.org/~declan/global/ -- 
right now, use the www2 address since not all directories seem to be 
updating on the mirror servers properly right now.
