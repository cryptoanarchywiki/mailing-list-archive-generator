The English-Only bill just passed in the House bans the use of
non-English languages by government officials.  Does Tim's sudden 
avoidance of the Latin mean that _he_'s the Fed??

Cui bono?  Or, in this case, risk to _whom_?
The damage from losing a key is done to the key's owner,
who's a mere Subject, while the dangers of needing a key
that one doesn't have are interference with the Custodians
doing the jobs they want to do.  Sounds like a no-brainer,
from the Government's viewpoint.
