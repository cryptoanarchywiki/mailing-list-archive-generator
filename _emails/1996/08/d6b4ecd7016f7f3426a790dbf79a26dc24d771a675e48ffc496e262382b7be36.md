It is just this sort of unnecessary condescending snottiness that
create the clear impression that Bart is an asshole.  Perhaps he
is a fine chap and this is just his style, but I find it very
offensive an counter-productive in this discussion.

To prove that I'm behaving badly you quote me out of context. My 
statement 'If you don't know the answer, there's nothing to be 
ashamed of', was immediately followed by the statement 'I don't 
know the answer either'. In this context, my statement wasn't that 
snotty. After all, I made clear that in this respect I wasn't any 
better than you. So I think you are overreacting a bit. Second, I 
didn't complain about the tone of your previous posts when you 
talked about me 'fretting' about the dropping wages of American 
workers, or when you wrote 'yada, yada, yada' in response to one 
of my posts. I don't even complain when you call me an asshole 
(except that maybe next time you start calling names you could 
be a bit more imaginative...) It's not that important. I guess I just 
get subconsciously a little irritated, and that's the reason I'm 
maybe a little less polite when I answer your posts than you would 
like me to be. So if you want me to behave nicer when I answer 
your posts, the best way to achieve this would be to start 
behaving nicer yourself.
