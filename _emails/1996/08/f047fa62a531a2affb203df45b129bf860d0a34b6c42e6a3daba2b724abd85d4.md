Hiya!

This is to announce the availability of NCSA HTTPd version 1.6b1.
It is accompanied by a version of XMosaic (2.6s_b1) which can be 
used for testing the security features.

To participate in the beta testing effort, please see

   http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/beta-1.6/


What's New:
----------

The main difference between 1.6b1 and 1.5.2 is the addition of
support for the following security protocols:

-- Secure-HTTP (version 1.1)
-- SSL versions 2.0 and 3.0

XMosaic 2.6s_b1 supports these protocols as well.


Motivation:
----------

We recognize that there are many fine web servers availble on the 
Internet, some even for free.  In releasing NCSA HTTPd 1.6b1, we are 
niether trying to 'outdo' other server development efforts, nor are we 
expecting to provide a server which will meet all possible needs.  
Rather, we wish to follow through on our commitment to making novel 
features available for experimentation and testing.  The capability
of performing digital signature-based authentication (via S-HTTP in
1.6b1) is an example of a feature we see lacking in the Web today.


Obtaining HTTPd 1.6b1:
-----------------------

Currently, HTTPd 1.6b1 is available in binary form to registered,
domestic users.  An exportable version will be available eventually,
and we will announce its availability by the same means.  To register
for beta testing 1.6b1, please go to the URL given above, and select 
the "register here" link after reading the page.

The documentation (under construction) for this release is available at

   http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs-1.6/

The HyperNews page (good for bug reports, questions, discussion) is at

   http://union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HyperNews/get/www/ncsa-httpd/1.6/beta.html

Administrative requests may be directed to httpd-beta@ncsa.uiuc.edu.


Thanks,
