Thanks for supplying more details. I'm not convinced, though, of all the
points. India still royally screwed itself, reputation-wise.

Here I feel compelled as a Loyal American to point out something that often
gets lost in the comments about America doesn't let enough immigrants in,
how it discriminates against immmigrants, etc. The thing to remember is
that virtually none of the countries which the most vocal critics are from
have anything approaching the U.S. policy about immigration!

Mexicans and U.S. critics of U.S. policy cite the "border problem."
However, Americans cannot work in Mexico except under extreme limitations.
Americans in Mexico cannot send their children to Mexican public schools.
And so on. This was described in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre," where
two Americans are stranded in Mexico, unable by law to work. Things haven't
changed much.

And what about immigration to Japan? Or Hong Kong? Or Taiwan? Ask the boat
people still rotting in camps, or turned back to sea to sink. How about
immigration into Switzerland, or Sweden, or France?

I don't have any knowledge about the situation on immigrating to India--I
don't know too many Americans who have, except some friends of friends who
moved to Goa some years back.

Personally, I favor open borders--but no public schooling, no tax-funded
handouts, no welfare, no child support, no public hospitals, etc.
