SingNet, one of Singapore's larger ISPs is telling all of their subscribers
they must move to using SingNet's proxy server by September 14, 1996 if they
want to have access to the Web.

If you try to access one of the SBA's banned sites, you'll get a message
that says, "The site you requested is not accessible."

Check out:

It's interesting that in the blurb about the proxy server, they're marketing
it as offering "better and faster performance" than not using it.
