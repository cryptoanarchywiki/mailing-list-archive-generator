It's interesting to know that Senator Hatfield's wife's birthday
is 1/17/29, and that the title to the car is held with a 
security interest by the US SENATE EMPLOYEES FEDERAL CREDIT,
and that (at least) Social Security Numbers weren't listed
for the plates I checked.  Also that, unlike many states,
the Governor doesn't have License Plate #1.
