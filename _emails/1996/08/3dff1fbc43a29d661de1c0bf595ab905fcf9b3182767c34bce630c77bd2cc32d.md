It seems that my address may have caused lots of problems for
the list, mailing lists were getting lots of bounces of things
sent to me.  I haven't heard for sure, but I'm guessing this
is the reason the list was taken down yesterday.

ACM Network Services tells me they have fixed the problem now.

Sorry about that, but I had no idea the problem was happening.
