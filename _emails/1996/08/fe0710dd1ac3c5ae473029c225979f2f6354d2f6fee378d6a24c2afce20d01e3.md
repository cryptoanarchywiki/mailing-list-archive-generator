As I recall, Ian, you are some kind of Damned Foreigner, a Canadian, and
possibly a Jew (from a name like "Goldberg"). As such, your Canuck
documents are worthless in these Beknighted States (at least until the
memory of the single person killed in Atlanta fades...Atlantans are worth
the lives of 100 lives of Third Worlders, which is why the single death in
Atlanta justifies this crackdown).

Perhaps if you coverted to either Southern Baptist or Mormon your stay here
would be easier.....
