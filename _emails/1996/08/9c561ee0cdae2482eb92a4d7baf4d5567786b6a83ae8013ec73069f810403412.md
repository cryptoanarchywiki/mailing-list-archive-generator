Though I am no defender of the People's Benovolent and Democratic
Government of Viet Nam, I think you must be thinking of Cambodia.

It was Cambodia, in the form of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, which decided
to exterminate all educated persons (except themselves, of course). Those
wearing eyeglasses were considered Enemies of the People, because
presumably they knew how to read.

Compared to Cambodia, Viet Nam was a paradise. In fact, I cheered in '79
when Viet Nam invaded Cambodia.
