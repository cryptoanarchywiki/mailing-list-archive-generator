(The machine crashed when I was writing this letter, so if cpunks got two,
I apologize.)

How would this rig be defended?

Pirates still exist.  Even if you can give them something to think about
with a 30/06 bullet at their waterline, there are always small countries
who have navies that can be hired.  They may be small and defenseless
compared to the US navy, but against a basically unarmed oil rig, do have
the ability to sink the rig at their whim.

Its ironic that I am playing Devil's Advocate with data havens, but have
the only working input/output code for one that I know of.  (I have been
having problems with it, so until I work some bugs out I haven't put it
for offer via FTP.)

I think for now try to make something that uses the same technology as a
data haven -- An offsite secure storage server.  Discussed in this list
about a year ago, this uses data haven code, and is equivalent to a
sufferance remailer, but at least these can exist.  The first step is
having them exist overtly first, and having "terms of service", then
working on DC-nets, "RAID" DH's, etc.

I have a tokenlike system -- "Storage Noodles", but haven't gotten it
working reliably yet.
