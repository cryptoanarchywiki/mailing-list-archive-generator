RAW was fond of pointing out that in spite of the current love of
democratic government, free societies are actually infrequent and
short-lived blips on the historical landscape.  

Something about basic human nature and "all you have to do is rock 
the boat a little and the people will beg the government to take their
rights away."

Since the government is usually in the best position to do any 
necessary cage-rattling, perpetual freedom is an illusory concept.
