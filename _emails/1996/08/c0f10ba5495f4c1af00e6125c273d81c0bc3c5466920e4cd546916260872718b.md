This is almost as amusing as the evidence cited by the Feds in the roundup
of militia members a couple of days ago. They told us in perfect seriousness 
that one of them had fired tennis balls out of a metal tube filled with hair

Obvious warning signs. :)

Of course bail was denied to protect the community.
