'Oppressive' is a subjective term, and is largely defined by what one is 
used to. Personally, I find the Bay area's climate very boring, too dry, and
usually too hot (and yes, I've been there many times, at all parts of the
year - I'm speaking from experience). Due to the lack of rain, the whole
country side also seems much dirtier than a place where everything,
both natural and artificial, gets a regular washing.

The last time I heard this argument was in a documentary film
about South African mining and agriculture, produced by South Africans, 
during the height of apartheid 'these great natuaral resources lay 
untapped until the arrival of a more industrious people, tempered by 
a colder climate...'

While there *is* some truth that people living in environments where 
survival does not depend on long-term planning have less pressure to
develop sophisticated industry, to claim that average temperature is the
main determinate is betrays an ignorance of history.

The technological pre-emminence of Northern Europe and derivative
cultures is a very recent phenomenom. Civilization was invented in
hot climates, and for most of history the more sophisticated cultures 
were in locations where you could sweat any time of the year - the
Mediterranean basin, Mesopotamia, India, coastal China, Central
America - in fact, in the classical period you could have mapped
out a 'civilized belt' surrounding the globe in a distinctly sub-tropical
climate.

In any place you can name, most of the people who can afford to move to
other areas do not do so. By your argument, Kuwait should be totally 
depopulated by now.
