If you need this "master key" feature embedded in the cryptosystem
itself, you're probably out of luck - such a cipher would be at least
as slow as a public key cryptosystem.  See Blaze, Feigenbaum, Leighton,
"Master-Key Cryptosystems", CRYPTO '96 rump session, available at
ftp://research.att.com/dist/mab/mkcs.ps .

However, you could simulate the function of such a system by
selecting a different key for each file and then encypting each unique
file key with the master encryption key (which could be a public
key or a symmetric key, depending on whether the application that
encrypts the files is trusted to know the master decryption key).
This has the disadvantage, however, of requiring that you store
the encrypted file key with each file, which may or may not be
an issue for you.
