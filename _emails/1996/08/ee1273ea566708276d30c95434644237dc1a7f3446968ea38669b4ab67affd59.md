C'punks,

Phillll came up with an excellent weasel this time.  He's offered
to "bet" on the Foresight Exchange.  The relevant part of their
FAQ says:

	How is FX different from a bookie?
          Besides the obvious fact that FX isn't real money,
	  it differs from placing bets with a bookie in that FX
          is a market.

In other words, it really isn't a bet at all.

Instead of putting his money where his mouth is, Phillll has
decided to put his mouth where his mouth is once again.  Nice
try guy.
