This afternoon's program on "Science Friday" on National Public 
Radio, broadcast from Washington, DC at 1800hrs GMT (2PM EDT) is on 
the future of the internet.  I was unable to get a list of guests, 
but past programs would suggest that there likely will be some 
interesting individuals.  Host Ira Flatow is much more techno-savvy 
than the usual broadcast personality.

Here is the description from the npr.org web site:

  Show Date: 8/16/96

  Topic for Hour One: Internet Update

  Synopsis:  A War is waging over the future of the Internet.  Who 
  will control it, and what will it look and sound like as it reaches 
  maturity?  In this hour of Science Friday, find out who the players 
  are, and what you can expect to see, or not see, on your computer 
  screen in the years to come. 

Sorry for the short notice.  I just heard the teaser this morning.
