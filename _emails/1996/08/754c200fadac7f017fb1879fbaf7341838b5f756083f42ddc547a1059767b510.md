Yeah, well it's pretty lame as far as threats go, two key words there are 
"hope" and "die," what's missing is a time frame and intent of action.  
Everyone after all does day, that hope isn't hopeless, but it's not a 
threat either.

Silly assed our president, but then again what else can he do to prove 
himself a jerk.  As for me, I don't hope he dies, he will after all after 
many years, die of old age.  No, I hope he doesn't get elected.  That's 
what I hope. :^)  Not that I'd want Dole either. :(

How about you Tim, when are you running for prez?  Heheheh!
