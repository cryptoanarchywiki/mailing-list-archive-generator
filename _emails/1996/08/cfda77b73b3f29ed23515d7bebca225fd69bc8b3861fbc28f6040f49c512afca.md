i, for one, and perhaps others on the list as well, would be interested in hearing
what you mean when you say, "At&t, Microsoft, etc) who are ripping people off on a 
daily basis". 

for example, in what way is AT&T ripping people off? and what about
microsoft? 

i have no use at all for microsoft, and, being a unix person i don't even
use their stuff, but, i wonder how many people use word, excel, powerpoint, etc
that they ripped-off from someone else, without paying microsoft what they are
due for having developed the products. 

in general, i suspect that the rip-off is going the other way. after all, 
no one forces anyone buy from microsoft, AT&T, etc., but people do steal from
them, whenever they have the opportunity. not everyone, of course, but certainly
some do.  

these companies provide products and/or services that you are free to 
purchase or not, as you see fit or can afford.
