it is my understanding that the Venona traffic used a code book with super-
encyption using a otp.  the break was possible because the Soviet's got
sloppy with the otp keys and in fact used some of them more than once. 
even then, it tooks years of work to make the breaks.  everything you ever
heard about using true random keys, and only once is true.  difficult as it
may be to accomplish,  it is possible to break a otp if the pad isn't really
'one time'.
