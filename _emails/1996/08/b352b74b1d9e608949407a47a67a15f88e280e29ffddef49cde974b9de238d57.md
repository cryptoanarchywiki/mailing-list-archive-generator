Frank presents a cogent example of how the Staelin plan is a nonstarter.
That is, it's a nonstarter *if* we remove any formal evidence of which
crypto method is attached to a program.

Cycles are cheap (compared to prison terms or a bullet in the head).
Therefore, it's cheaper to let folks either make their own guesses at the
crypto involved, or try several, than it is to unambigiously narrow down
the searches to one particular algorithm, which the State can then insist
on a decryption key for.

Let the Staelin Plan be warning for us to prepare for an era in which the
particular crypto method should not be revealed.

(Cryptographically, any of the various algorithms are "polynomially
equivalent," but, practically, the "King James Defense" used by Frank,
brilliantly, will probably work. It's hard to argue with Scripture.)
