This is a very thoughtful essay. We need more of them.

Though "I agree" messages are frowned upon, the fact is that most
Cypherpunks messages understandably are messages critiquing or disagreeing
with some part of another message...this is not too surprising.

But sometimes it's useful to say "I agree."

This is essentially a "squatter's rights" kind of "blurring," as I see it.
(And I don't agree with the argument for the blurring.) The argument goes
something like this: "I've been coming to this Mall for many years, and
this is where the people I want to see my protest come. Therefore, I have
earned a kind of squatter's right to enter your property and make my
protest."

The larger game-theoretic point is the one Lou notes later, that the
players on all sides use the law to jockey for advantage--the merchant gets
skateboarding and loitering banned on public streets, customers of private
shopping malls get the courts to let them set up their protests on the
property of others.

(Needless to say, I don't sympathize with either example.)

And just as one lobbying group is pushing for restrictions in public places
of "loiterers" and "bums" (my town, Santa Cruz, passed a law which
criminalized _sitting_ on public streets, even out of the flow of traffic),
other lobbying groups are pushing for interfering with rights of employers
to set dress codes, as but one example.

A constant confusion of what "rights" really are.
