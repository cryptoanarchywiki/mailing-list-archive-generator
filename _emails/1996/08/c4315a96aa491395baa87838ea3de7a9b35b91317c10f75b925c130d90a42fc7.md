Unfortunately, there's no easy way to rmgroup a usenet newsgroup once it
gets created. Many sites ignore all rmgroups. In fact, many large sites
now ignore all newgroups unless a user specifically asks to carry a new
newsgroup.

I believe the main reason why most newsadmins seem to want to have some
restrictions on newgrouping is the lack of efficient rmgrouping.

If we could newgroup misc.news.current-events.empire-state-bombing
and then have it disappear quetly and automatically once the non-spam
traffic is gone, I'm sure a lot fewer people would object to its creation.

Assuming that this is done, why bother with newgroup/rmgroup at all?
If you think comp.language.algol is a worthwhile newsgroup (as I do),
just put it in your header and see if anyone sees your article.
Well-named keywords in Newsgroups: will act as these Snelling(?)
points senile Tim ranted about.

The reason for Cabal's existence is twofold. First, it is a bunch
of control freaks who want to be in charge and get a kick out of
telling users "you can't do this". Second, sysadmins are willing
to put up with this shit because they think they need some means
to control newsgrouping.

Absolutely.

Yes.

Usenet as I knew it 1- years ago has already been destroyed.
