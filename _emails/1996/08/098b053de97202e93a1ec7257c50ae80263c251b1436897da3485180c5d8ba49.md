That was the keylength paper.  I think their estimate is way off.

But that's ok-- I do so like the ring of ``8-cent encryption'', even
if I think the derivation is technically dubious :-)

Not with SSL.

SSL uses a random 88-bit salt which is different for every session.
This attack doesn't work.  Fun to think about, though, eh? :-)

[ Unsalted 40-bit RC4 is super-dangerous, and there are all sorts of
nasty games one can play with it.  That's why you should avoid it. ]

Same deal.


Keep those ideas flowing-- one of 'em is bound to work.
