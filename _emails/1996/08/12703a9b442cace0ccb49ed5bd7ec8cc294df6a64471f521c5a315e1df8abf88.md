    This is very similiar to the law (federal I believe) which states 
that you must report any 'computer crimes' to the authorities.  There are 
no punishments and it was obviously crafted to be more of a means of 
counting the crimes than solving them.  If anyone is interetes, I will 
get the specifics.
