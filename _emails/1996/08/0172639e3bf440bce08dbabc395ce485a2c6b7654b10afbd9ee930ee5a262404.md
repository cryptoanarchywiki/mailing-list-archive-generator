	They're arresting this guy because he had one mention of a Molotov
Cocktail? Why am I reminded of the Haymarket trials? Where's a Governor
Altgeld when you need him? Admittedly, this guy doesn't seem too bright... but
if that were a reason to lock him up, the prisons would be even more crowded
than they are now.

>   JONESBORO, Ga. -- An 18-year-old self-styled anarchist who allegedly

>   has been charged with advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government.
   
[...]

>   Clayton County police Lt. Larry Gibson said Moreland turned himself in
>   Sunday. Authorities obtained an arrest warrant for Moreland Saturday
>   after the pipe bombing at Centennial Olympic Park, although police say
>   they don't think he played any role in the crime.
   
>   "He told us he was only interested in destroying property, and I don't
>   think he fully understands the ramifications," Gibson said. "Whatever
>   he was up to, we wanted to nip it in the bud."
   
>   Moreland had been under investigation since July 8 when authorities
>   received a copy of a pamphlet called "Rise Above." Police traced the
>   pamphlets to a mail box service in a shopping center allegedly rented
>   in Moreland's name.
   
>   The pamphlet was laced with with anti-police cartoons, obscenities,
>   and anarchist slogans. The one overt reference to violence was an
>   illustration of a "Molotov cocktail" on the same sheet with a recipe
>   for "soy milk" made from water-soaked soybeans, sugar and vanilla and
>   strained through a T-shirt.
