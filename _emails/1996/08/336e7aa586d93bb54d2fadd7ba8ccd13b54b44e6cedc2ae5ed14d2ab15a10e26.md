I'd vote "no" to converting this list into a newsgroup.  I think universal
access to e-mail is more guaranteed than access to a news-server, especially
for those of us hidden away behind our Gestapo-run firewalls.  The mailing
list flies quite nicely through them.  Plus, we have the added benefit of
only getting crypto-related spam thrown at us occasionally, instead of the
nearly ubiquitous "Call 1-900-HOT-4U" postings that seem to flood every
Usenet group.  ('Course, I seem to recall a www.slut.com letter from someone
a few days ago...)

Plus, sci.crypt exists for those who can't get enough here.

As an aside, if an RFD should be called, to whom should we forward our
discussion?  (It's been many years since I really cared about Usenet.)
