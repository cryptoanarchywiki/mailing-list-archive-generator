Excerpt from http://www.msnbc.com/news/21324.asp
Clinton's golf war 
Teed-off clubbers grumble president plays too slow, disrupts things

Congressional Country Club Secretary Tim May confirms that 
some members have complained about the president, but insists that 
"more members are delighted the president is playing at our club."
_________

Is there something that Tim isn't telling us? ;-)
