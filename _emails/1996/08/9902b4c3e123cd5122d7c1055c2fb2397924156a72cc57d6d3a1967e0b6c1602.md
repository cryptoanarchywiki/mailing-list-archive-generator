There's four major problems with this.  First off, a large number of 
guns used in homicides are revolvers or derringers (anyone got the 
numbers?).  These guns don't spit out the shells.  So, it would be 
utterly useless to do so.  The second problem is the number of shells 
expelled in the US every day.  I doubt there's enough room on the 
butt end of a shell to print that number (it couldn't be printed on 
the sides, as this would screw up the fit of the shell, and possibly 
weaken it).  And, it'd be almost impossible getting gun manufacturers to
pay for the equiptment that it would take to emprint serial numbers.  
The third number is that cartridges 
are recycled.  Aside from reloading your own, there's a large number 
of people that sweep up brass from gun ranges to reload themselves.  
The idea that someone swept up the brass could get almost anyone off. 
The final problem is the paperwork.  Cops today can barly keep up 
with the paperwork involved with the Brady Bill.  Could you imagine 
if they had to keep track of AMMO purchases?

The provision to give people the means to commit treason against the 
government are in the Constitution.  That's why the second amendment 
is there -- to empower the people to protect themselves against the 
government.  Then there's the first amendment, which is there 
partially so that the people can keep the government in check with 
speech and the press.

The NRA, I'm sorry to say, has screwed up royally.  It's about time 
that they regroup, or else they fall.
