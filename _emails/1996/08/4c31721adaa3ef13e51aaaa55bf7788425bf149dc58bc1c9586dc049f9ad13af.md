You still don't get it, do you?

It doesn't matter what random idiots tag onto your key so long as
there is no trust path between the user of the key and the idiot who
tagged stuff on. If someone signs "grand wizard of the KKK" onto your
key, what do you care if no one trusts the signator who attached the
crap?

Why do you care?

I wouldn't give a flying rat's buttocks, because unless the signatures
are widely trusted the information is noise.
