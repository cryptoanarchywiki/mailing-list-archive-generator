Which is why it is possible to be angry about NAFTA and the Mexican 
bailout without being a protectionist.

Why should I pay taxes to my government so it can protect capital 
investments in Mexico, thereby reducing one of my selling points as an 
American worker?

... and while I'm ranting...

Can somebody explain why:

1. Good jobs of the future are knowledge jobs which require little 
capital investment.

and

2. We need a capital gains tax cut to encourage capital investment to 
stimulate the growth of good jobs of the future.

?
