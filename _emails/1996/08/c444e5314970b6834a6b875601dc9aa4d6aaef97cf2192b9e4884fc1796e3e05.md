Heretics it depends, drug dealers no problem, but anonymous
remailer operators haven't been beheaded yet. Their persecution
will probably take much more subtle forms -- denial of government
jobs or contracts (lawbreakers and anarchists, after all),
whatever hurts most. There are many ways of manipulation in an
advanced, information based society that are no less cruel than
the torture of more overtly authoritarian ones.

International covenants aren't entirely useless: governments have
to report to the UN how much success they are having in
implementation, and are questioned closely. If indeed the fears
of many of you come true, cypherpunks will have far greater
awareness of human rights instruments and their usefulness (or
lack thereof) before the century is done.
