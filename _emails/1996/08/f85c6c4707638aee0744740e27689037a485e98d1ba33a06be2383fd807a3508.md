THe CBS Radio News (I think that's who) mentioned this morning that the
screening criteria for deciding whose baggage to search with fancy
machines, would include methods the passenger had chosen to make payments,
not merely for the ticket, but for his daily purchases. That this idea was
floating around a long time and has been given new impetus since the
flight 800 take-down. 

Any one else see the analysis I saw on newsgroup (forget which) which 
analyzed the pattern of damage to the aircraft, and came to the conclusion 
that it had to be a proximity-fused missle.
