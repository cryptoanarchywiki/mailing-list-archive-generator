I should have been clearer.

Indeed an in rem jurisdiction case relies on the property seizure as
notice.  A default judgement against for example, $233,445.00 and several
unnamed individuals" would clearly have problems along the service of
process lines if ever contested.

Practically speaking, however, the above are judgements against "John
Doe"'s.  Clearly this is not a "trial" in the strict sense of the word.

Agreed.

Nicely put.
