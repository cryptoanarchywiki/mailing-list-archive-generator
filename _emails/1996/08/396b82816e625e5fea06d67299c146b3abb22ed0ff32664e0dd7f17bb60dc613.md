Well, this depends on a couple of definitions.  For example, how do
you define "reasonable time"?  The most concise answer I can give you
is "we don't know".  An answer that would make you feel more
comfortable is that we believe that factoring a 1024-bit key using
GNFS is about 300,000 times harder than factoring a 512-bit key using
GNFS.

This doesn't take into account increase in computer power.  If you
take into account increase in technology at the current rate, doubling
every 18 months, then a 1024-bit key should be breakable in about 100
years.

However this doesn't take into account increases in algorithms.  There
is no way to predict the discovery of a new factoring algorithm.  In
addition, there is no way to predict a computational discovery which
might increase the base technology faster than the current trend.

To get back to your question: If smoe [sic] organization spent 10
billions [sic] of dollars on a cracking machine, would it be possible
to crack the keys in a reasonable time?

Well, lets assume a P100 is 50 MIPS and costs $500.  Then the $10B
would purchase 20 million machines.  Discounting the storage
requirements (factoring a number this large will probably require on
the order of hundreds of GBs of storage) and end-time processing power
(unknown) required to factor a 1024-bit number, this set of machines
would provide "enough" relations for a 1024-bit number in about 1.5
years per key.

PS: These are napkin-style numbers, and I'm making a lot of
assumptions here...  I assume no responsibility if you use these
numbers and they are wrong.
