Thinking about this some more - what would people want to see in such a
betting system.  Would you be happy with two choices?:

	(Clinton/Dole) or Other

or three choices?:

	Clinton, Dole or Other

or would you want more choices than this?  I'm asking, since we've been
tossing around this presidential election idea for a few days now, but
since we're not Americans, we're not too sure what is a suitable set
(bearing in mind that our idea for this will get more difficult as the
number of choices increases).
