Only 24 hours in each day. How do you spend your time?

Spray my name on a subway train
Carve my name in a video game
Out looking for the camera crew
Sell my soul for a second on the six-o'clock news
Gonna live 'til the bubble pops
Hold my breath when the big one drops
Immortality is what I'm buying
But I'd rather be immortal
                by not dying.
