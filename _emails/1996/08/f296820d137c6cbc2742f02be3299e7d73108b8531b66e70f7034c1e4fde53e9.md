I understand how it affects their claim for the security of escrowed
keys, but I'm afraid I don't follow the other argument.  How would the
wide availability of strong encryption have helped prevent the breakin?
How would encryption in general prevent breakins?  I'd love to use this
as an argument for strong encryption, but I don't see how it really
applies.
