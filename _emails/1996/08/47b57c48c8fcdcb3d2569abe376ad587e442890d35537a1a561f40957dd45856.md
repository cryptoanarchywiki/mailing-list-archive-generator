Every time I think about voting for Dole, I read something in the papers
that convinces me it is a bad idea.  The most recent is that he wants to
raise the intensity of the disastrous, failed war on drugs.

You know the war.  The one that has forced suppliers to enforce their
contracts with violence because the courts won't help them.  The one that
eliminated the concept of responsible use which has worked so well with
alcohol.  The one that has eliminated reputation from the drug market,
leading to overdoses and poisonings.  The one that is responsible for most
of the wire taps authorized in the USA.  The one that has turned the USA
into the prison capitol of the world.  Don't get me started.
