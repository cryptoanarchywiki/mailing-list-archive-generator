After watching the news during the coverage of the 911 call, I couldn't
help but  notice the free computer advertisement.  I don't suppose that
                             GATEWAY 2000
will be doing too much  bragging about supplying systems to the Atlanta
911 call center.  Gosh, I wonder what systems my local 911 call  center
uses?     Would    they    be     able    to    find     my    address?
