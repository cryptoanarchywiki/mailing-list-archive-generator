Doesn't sound much like a "threat" to me.

It sounds to me like the Chicops were just showing their "loyalty" by 
sitting on somebody, not that they believed any real crime had been committed.

But it isn't even a "threat", regardless of how "serious" it was.   The "I 
hope you die"  part is, presumably, a statement of fact:  She did, indeed, 
hope he dies.  But I don't see how hoping this can be considered a threat, 
or even SAYING she's hoping this is, likewise.


Makes me wonder whether visiting one of these appearances with a "Clinton 
Doll" and a bunch of pins, and visibly inserting those pins into the doll 
(while uttering various strange incantations), would constitute a "threat."

Frankly, I'd rather have a president who didn't feel the need to be 
protected by thugs.
