Somebody needs to do their homework. Austin, TX has been taxing ISP's
for at least a year now. A recent Internet Provider meeting on this
issue resulted in a return to ISP's of a goodly amound of their taxes
because of various issues (read that I didn't go to meeting, I don't run an
ISP but a SOHO consultancy w/ Internet services).

I have to pay the state 8.25% interest on any funds my customers deliver
to me.
