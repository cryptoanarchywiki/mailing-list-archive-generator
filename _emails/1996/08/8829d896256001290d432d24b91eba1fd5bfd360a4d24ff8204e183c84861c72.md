I've heard this example used for years, and I'm skeptical. The methods and
experts needed by early aviation companies were completely different from
the methods and experts the railroad companies had; I'm not convinced that
deciding one is in the "transportation business" is the key.

I see zero chance a local ISP will attempt to use the courts to "get out
of" a charge he has incurred. For one thing, his supplier can simply say
"you don't pay, you get cut off," and be supported by the courts. For
another, even the ISP may not be able to simply tell which customers are
using telephony programs and which are just dowloading pictures of Christy
Canyon.

Will "unmetered" usage go away? It depends on a lot of factors. Right now,
unmetered usage is a big enough marketing draw that it appears to
outcompete metered usage plans. Sure, there are people like me who pay a
flat rate (in my case, $20/month) and yet who are on for several hours a
day. But the subscribers who also pay the $20/mo and yet who are on only
briefly to check their mail are not clamoring to switch to metered usage.

If Internet telephony becomes a big deal, I still suspect unmetered usage
will be common. If the capacity isn't there, from the ISP through the
various links to the other person's ISP then there will be stalls and
delays. Think of it as evolution in action, like crowded freeways.
