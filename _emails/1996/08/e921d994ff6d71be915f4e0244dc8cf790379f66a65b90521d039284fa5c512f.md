And artistic, political, cultural, etc. materials are of course one of the
main markets, as the large number of bookstores shows. (And the success of
"Primary Colors," by "Anonymous," shows that one need not the True Name of
an author, obvious to all persons on this list.)

Yes, a topic we've discussed many times over the years. I don't have the
time to compose a new essay on this, so I'll refer folks to either the
archives or my Cyphernomicon FAQ, which discusses reputations, third party
escrow services, etc.

(Imagine an equally anonymous "Ace Escrow Service," which holds the cash
until a product is transferred. Essentially, this is what a _store_ does.
For example, a Barnes and Noble or a Home Depot chooses which products to
stock based on their own evaluations, tests, and reputation
assessments...and they make good on defective products, etc. This lessens
the risks to the consumer that he will be screwed by a vendor he has little
recourse against. "Middlemen.")

Sure, these are all issues. (As the Assyrian merchant said in 1300 B.C.
"This idea of a "store" you have...I can think of many problems. How will
they all be solved?")

I disagree, but this was obvious from the focus of my post. I believe we
see "distributed trust" (though this is not the choice of words I would
use) all around us.

Too many issues to debate here.

My point was that the BlackNet approach *is* like a physical data haven,
except with some advantages.
