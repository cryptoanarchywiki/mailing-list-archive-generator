	The usual governmental rhetoric. Again, I'm not seeing achnowledgement
from anyone except maybe the ACLU that there's no evidence that such tactics
would have stopped the TWA bombing - not that they would be justified even if
it would have. Legalized drugs, etcetera would free up quite enough law
enforcement to take care of the problem.

>   WASHINGTON (Aug 1, 1996 1:41 p.m. EDT) -- FBI Director Louis Freeh
>   said today Americans are under increasing attack by terrorists and
>   proposed new wiretapping authority would not greatly expand
>   government's powers.
   
>   "The country and the American people have been experiencing an
>   increasing war against them by terrorists and terrorist-supported
>   activities," Freeh told a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.
>   Americans "are clearly under attack and we are the prime targets for
>   this kind of terrorism."

>   A leading GOP opponent of an earlier, more sweeping anti-terrorism
>   bill said today he didn't believe Congress could enact a new package
>   before its recess this weekend.
   
>   "I think it would be very difficult to do in light of the logistics

>   Asked about Barr's comments, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, head of a
>   bipartisan task force that has been negotiating with administration
>   officials on the anti-terrorism proposals, said, "That's part of the
>   obstacle. It's what we have to deal with. What we do has to reach the
>   level of consensus."
   
>   The negotiators, led by Craig and White House chief of staff Leon
>   Panetta, said they hoped to have a package ready for a vote by week's
>   end before Congress leaves for its August recess.
