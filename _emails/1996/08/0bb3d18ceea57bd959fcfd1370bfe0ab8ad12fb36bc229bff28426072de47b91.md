Below is from EFF source.

Does anyone have specifics on where this piece of idiocy is supposedly
going from here?  When does Congress reconvene on this issue?

Any specific activities going on regarding this piece of crap?


[begin quote]========================================================================


This is the language that Feinstein inserted into the Defense 
Authorization Act.  It has been passed by the Senate.  This is not
good, but significantly different from her first effort last Spring (a 
similar amendment, to the S.735 anti-terrorism bill of 1995). This
language is technology-neutral.  However, it does have a very slippery
'intent' or 'knowledge' standard, and though the language of the bill 
does not directly focus on the Internet, all of Feinstein's commentary on 
the Senate floor and to the press have focused exclusively on 
"bomb-making information" on the Internet.  Though this new version of 
her Net censorship proposal is possibly constitutional, unlike the 
earlier one, a key question that all constituents and journalists need to 
ask of Sen. Feinstein is: If you are simply trying to criminalize online 
incitement of, or conspiracy to commit, murder by bomb, then what on 
earth does this bill do?  Both of these things are *already illegal* 
online or offline.



                                           S.1762
