Terrorism Fears Prompt Support for Limits

LOS ANGELES (Reuter) - Most U.S. citizens are willing to give up some civil liberties in order to fight terrorism, according to a poll published Thursday. 

A nationwide survey conducted by the Los Angeles Times after the explosion of TWA Flight 800 and the bombing at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park also
showed that Americans favored economic sanctions over military action against countries involved in terrorism. 

It found that 65 percent of those surveyed were somewhat or very concerned that the fight against terrorism could bring restrictions on civil liberties but 58 percent
said they would be willing to give up some liberties to help curb terrorism. 

Government and aviation officials have indicated that increased security measures at airports around the country could mean more thorough and time-consuming
inspections of luggage, questioning of travelers and higher fares. 

Of those polled, 66 percent said they strongly favoured more secure airports, even at such costs, while 17 percent said they ``somewhat favoured'' such measures. 

Asked what action, in addition to trying those individuals responsible, the United States should take if the TWA crash is linked to another country, 40 percent
favoured economic sanctions against that nation, 14 percent opted for military action, 10 percent thought both should be used and 8 percent thought no action
should be taken apart from a trial. 

The telephone survey of 1,572 adults was conducted from Aug. 3 through Aug. 6 and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
