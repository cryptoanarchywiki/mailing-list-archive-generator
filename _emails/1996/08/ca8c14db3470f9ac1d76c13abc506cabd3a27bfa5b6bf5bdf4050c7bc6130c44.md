I never really liked having my ass kissed much, so I'll find out the 
truth tomorrow.

I got a fax sent from a Senate office yesterday saying that it was in the
platform, even though it doesn't appear (yet) on the rnc.org web site --
a fact you'll note I mentioned in my original message. 

It was a good rant, though, Rich. Nicely done.
