[set discussion is available on set-discuss@commerce.net . Majordomo stuff]

This would seem to be a new policy; previously I'd heard that mastercard 
and visa were going to be encouraging the use of SET quite strongly, but 
since SET isn't going to be available until at least Q1 97, it would be 
silly to stop all activity now.

SET is massively over-engineered and is one of most obnoxious crypto 
protocols you'll find, but it does have some cute features (merchant 
never learns card number, etc).
