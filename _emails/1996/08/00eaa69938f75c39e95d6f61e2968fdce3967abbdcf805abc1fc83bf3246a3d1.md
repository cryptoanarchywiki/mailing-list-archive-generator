To the first comment, numerical superiority is not sufficient reason in a
democracy to justify actions by that democracy. One of the basic ideas
behind  democracy is that certain aspects of individuals are inherent and
uncontrollable by that democracy (ie rights). To my mind democracy is the
only form of government which recognizes a priori that everyone is not alike
and therefore will want different things. This can be said of no other form
of government which treats persons as identical cogs in a government
machine. In short, democracy is not mob rule however much the majority might
like that idea. I would say that the first comment above can be said another
way,

"If you have been raped once then you should not complain any about
subsequent rapes." 

Clearly utter bullshit. This is pure and simple victim-speak.

As to the second, you are not free to define public nuisance, only nuisances
to yourself. The burden of proof rests on the individual to prove that such
actions by a third party are a public nuisance. For something to be a public
nuisance its effects MUST extend to property or persons other than the
instigator AND it must be shown that damage occurs without prior permission.
Simply because they do something that irks you does not make it public let
alone a nuisance.
