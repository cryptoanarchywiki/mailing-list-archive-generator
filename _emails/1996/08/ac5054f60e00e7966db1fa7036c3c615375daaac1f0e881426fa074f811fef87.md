In the meantime, before these technological fixes are easily implemented,
what is the proper way to handle unwanted commercial mail?

1) delete immediately

2) reply with 'Fuck off, morons!'

3) as in 2) plus an attachment of some 1Mb file

4) as in 3) plus a CC to the postmaster of the sending site

What if the spam says: 'Do only reply to this if you want
further contact with us' etc?

Does anybody have good advice, including risks for retaliation
from the vendors/postmasters for such 're-spam'?
