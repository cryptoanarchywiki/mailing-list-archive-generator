  Looks like a crock to me. He gives no email address to contact him with,
no business name, and it sounds like an extremely user un-friendly program.
People are definatly better off using PGP.

  I'd bet that his unpublished algorithm is an XOR with the key, and that
it could be broken pretty easily. I'd also be that there is no $10,000
reward.

  People like this guy give cryptography a bad name. They target people who
don't know much and are susceptible to his claims and who would be better
off using PGP or ViaCrypt.

  What can we do to dispute his claims? Has anyone gotten a copy of his
sample message yet?
