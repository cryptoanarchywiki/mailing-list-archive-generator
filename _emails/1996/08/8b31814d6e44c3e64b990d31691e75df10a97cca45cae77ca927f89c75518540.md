At one time, I worked in a position requiring all kinds of
clearances - TS, SCI, {xxx} etc.

We hired a bunch of new engineers. They'd all been through the
wringer before we brought them on board. This takes 6 months or
so; Full Field Investigation, etc.......

They showed up all ready to work for Uncle Sam.  The very first
form they encountered was the I9 "Prove you are a citizen..."
