I don't think it's quite that hard, so I tried to implement asymetric key
cryptography:

20 minutes, to write and debug:

(d encrypt (l (message key)
              (l (n) (if (= key n) message))))

(d makekey (l () (d dkey ())
                 (l (n) (if (!= dkey ()) (encrypt n dkey)
                                         (set dkey n)))))

(d keypair (l () (d a (makekey)) (d b (makekey)) (a b) (b a) (list a b)))

(d keys (keypair))

(d p "Squeamish Ossifrage")
(d c ((car keys) p))
(c (cadr keys))
"Squeamish Ossifrage"
(c (car keys))
()

It relies on a few features of my MUD language, namely that functions
are opaque datatypes, and that any two calls to l (short for lambda)
return objects distinct to !=.

It is a big project, but the big part is writing the MUD, not adding the
crypto-anarchy stuff to it.  I'm writing a MUD anyway, and have been off
and on for over a year.  Mark Grant's message made me think about what it
would take to add the features I wasn't already planning on.

I'm still interested in ideas as to what primitives I should fake.

After I think about it more, I realize that a MUD simulation can't show
that something like "assassination politics" wouldn't work.  At best it
can show that it does or doesn't work in that particular environment,
leaving open the question of what key difference between MUD and reality
might change the result.  Still, it would be interesting to see how it
worked, or why it didn't.

I apologize for my earlier comment that presupposed that it would fail.
