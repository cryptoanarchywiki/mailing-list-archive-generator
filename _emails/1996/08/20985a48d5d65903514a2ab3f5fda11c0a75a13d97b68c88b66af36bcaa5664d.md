First of all, you are talking about Morton Grove, not Elk Grove.  Second of all, 
the ban was mostly ignored--the first year it was in effect, only 17 guns were 
turned in. The Morton Grove gun ban was not a statistically significant event.

there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that 
threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will 
pledge with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every 
man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenarios, individual rights 
will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well being granted to 
them by their world government."
