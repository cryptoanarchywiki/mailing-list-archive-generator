I am sure one of the 100+ X-Pats on this island would have been talking
about it if this were going to be eliminated, and I have not heard
anything. So I am sure it is still there.  But you can call 1-800-tax-1040
to check. After they finish with this question, ask them what it means in
the tax code where it says that income taxes are "voluntary complience". 
Have your Websters open to the definition of voluntary. Always good for a
laugh. 

The idea was no taxes on the first $70,000 earned outside the USA.
Dividends and interest were not counted as "earned".

Having $70,000 that you can earn tax free will never translate into a
$70,000 break on your taxes (unless they get to 100% tax rate).
