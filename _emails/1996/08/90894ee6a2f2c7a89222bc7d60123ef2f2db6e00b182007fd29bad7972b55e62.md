wouldn't have left the US), but not necessarily lower in any
absolute sense. I thought this was obvious, but since Arun Mehta
also misunderstood me, maybe I should have been more explicit here.

Pardon me, but I'm still confused. When Hazlitt talks about how
many machines are employed, surely that's "absolute" capital, not
relative. If US capital is invested abroad sensibly, such that it
enriches the investors, they have more money to invest in
machines at home and thereby increase local productivity (and wages).
