There is a new system about to be deployed in the UK that combines GPS 
with cell-phone technology; if the vehicle is stolen it can call the 
anti-theft service and report the location; I belive the vehicle can also 
be remotely immobilised.For the truely paranoid out there, the system is 
known as "SkyNet" :)

p.s.
  If we're talking about "The Prisoner" and cars, does anybody know 
anywhere I could get a lotus or caterham 7 in the states?
