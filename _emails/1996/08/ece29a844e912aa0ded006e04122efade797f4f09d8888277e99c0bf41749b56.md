Actually, DEC is trying to stay in business building
expensive Windows boxes.

The numbers I remember hearing are something like:
1,000,000 Unix machines
10,000,000 Macs
150,000,000 "PCs" (presumable not running *nix)

Why should we care what platform people develop for?
I use all of 'em.  If a package supports more than one, 
all the better.

As to why one should develop crypto stuff
for unix, the demographics of this list are probably
reason enough.. I use PCs as my main platform, 
but I get the distinct impression that most of
the folks here use unix primarily.  Maybe they're
just the most vocal :)

Pardon my French, but you mus be fucking stupid or somehing.  How many
universities use UNIX platforms?  How many companies use UNIX platforms?
Sun, DEC, and SGI don't stay in buisiness by building cheap Windows boxes
ya know.  There are 13948 _registered_ LINUX machines, not to mention the
unregistered ones.  Don't tell me that Cray's were designed to run MacOS
or Windows 95.  UNIX isn' NEARLY as dead as Apple is.
