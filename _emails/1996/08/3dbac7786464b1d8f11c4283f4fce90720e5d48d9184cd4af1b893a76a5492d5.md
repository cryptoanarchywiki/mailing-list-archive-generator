Further, my original question, phoned in anonymously to the FBI,
mailed in anonymously to this list, and asked to the media (I
guess I like wasting my time) has never been either asked or
answered. I will restate it in stronger terms:
"Why the hell, when you have a tape of the perp. saying something,
do you not air it in the middle of a city chock full of people
who could very well know this guy's voice/mannerisms?" Why didn't
the media ask for it, and then give the answer (the fibbieclerk
had no answer at all for me) the FBI gave?? Am I missing something?
We hear 911 tapes ALL THE TIME of various stuff happening. Has the
FBI suddenly become a bunch of civil liberties activists WRT the
privacy of terrorist bombers?
Just asking.
