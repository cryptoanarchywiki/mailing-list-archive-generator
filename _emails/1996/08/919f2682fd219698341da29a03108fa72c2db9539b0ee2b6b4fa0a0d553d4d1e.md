Personally I enjoyed helping to bring to market a full-featured PGP-aware 
mail package.  It was a product that I was interested in seeing and was 
able to participate in making suggestions as to features, etc.  It

NT which was not initially supported, but is my platform (along with 
Linux).  It is a good product and will help to ease usability of PGP for 
people that are afraid of the steps required by many mailers to utilize 
PGP.  If I remember, your platform in Linux and you should not be so quick 
to criticize what you may have not seen.
