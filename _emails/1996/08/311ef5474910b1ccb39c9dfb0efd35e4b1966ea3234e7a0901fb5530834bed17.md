Or just walk out of a Mission, and buy one on K Street.

But it's easier to just get an account on an ISP.

I recall several chats with a .nl UN Mission Staffer. He was on
Panix or PSI or such. Maybe we should require proof of citizenship
before granting a license to use IP.

(The irony was, he did not realize the Vienna Convention
covered his rented residence as well as the Mission...)
