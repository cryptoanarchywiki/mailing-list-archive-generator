Virtually no one in the history of the world has done any time for giving a
false SS#.  Considering the fact that millions of Americans daily drive
drunk, exceed the lawful speed limit, drift through stop signs without
coming to a complete halt pick each other up in bars and do a host of other
things that are much more likely to get them in trouble than making up an
SS#, I am constantly *amazed* that people always advise you not to do so.

If it's good enough for the President of Israel, it's good enough for anyone.

But most DMVs don't check and the SS is still resisting verification
services (at least until the Immigration Bill passes).

Just make sure you give the insurance company and the doctor the same number.

The SS resists issuing new numbers in spite of widespread duplication and
theft.  Soon people will find themselves denied the right to work in this
country unless the SS reverses this reluctance.  If your SS# is stolen and
used "too many times"  in a future worker verification program, you're
screwed.  And there won't even be any welfare for you.

Use Alta Vista to find the SS Number FAQ.  There's more stuff.
