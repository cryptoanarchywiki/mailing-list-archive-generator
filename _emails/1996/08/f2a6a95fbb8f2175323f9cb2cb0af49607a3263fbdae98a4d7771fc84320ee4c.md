I wonder if such equipment is used on CSPAN and CSPAN-2?

(And that's a serious question!)



There is a relatively famous neurologist named Oliver Sacks who has written 
a series of books concerning odd brain disorders among his and other 
patients.  In one book (maybe it was, "The Man who mistook his wife for a 
hat") he describes a scene where a group of patients with the same ailment 
(maybe it was called "aphasia", but it's been a few years...) were watching 
a speech by Ronald Reagan.    As I recall, people with this ailment can't 
understand what's being said to them, but they CAN tell whether the person 
speaking is telling the truth.  (or, at least, BELIEVES he's telling the 
truth...)  

All the patients laughed at Reagan's speech.
