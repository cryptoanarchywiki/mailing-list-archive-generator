OK, Rich cites a loon, but the fact is that Southern Air Transport 
right here in Miami was in there early in the contraarms-coke 
trade. You don't make the real money in any transport business 
unless you can have full loads both ways. Also, the skills needed 
to land an overloaded airplane on an unimproved strip are different 
than those held by typical pilots, even very good, carrier-rated 
military pilots. Drugsmugglers had 'em, nobody else did, the CIA 
needed pilots with the skills to have their filthy little war. You 
can search the "major papers" libraries of West & Lexis for:
"mena /p cocaine" and find all kinds of stuff. You can look into 
the case of John Hall's ranch in Costa Rica and find all kinds of 
stuff, too. The best experiment I've run across is to ask anyone 
(especially anyone under 30, for some reason) the following:
"Do you think those planes came back empty?" When I do this, _I_ 
don't have to say the word "cocaine," they say it for me. Every 
time. It is a major, bipartisan, Watergate-style but bigger 
scandal, and the strange bedfellows in the media who were doing a 
halfway decent job of covering it [The Wall Street Journal and 
"High Times" magazine(!)] have fallen strangely silent on the 
subject as the election approaches. Hmmmmm.
