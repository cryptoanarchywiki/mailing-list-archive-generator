I don't have a vested interest other than keeping my data safe.

A *good* cipher will work, even if someone knows the exact 
implementation of it.  Given complete source code to your cipher,
(including the pseudo-random number generator you use) 
and I could easily crack it with about a week's worth of effort.

If you knew anything about cryptography, you'ld know that just
giving someone some cyphertext and challenging them to crack
is not a valid test of the cipher's strength.

Again - go get a copy of Applied Cryptography and don't 
come back until you have read it.
