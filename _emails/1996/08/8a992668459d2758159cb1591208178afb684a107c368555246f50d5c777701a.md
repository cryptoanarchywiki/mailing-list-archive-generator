Indiannapolis, IN (A.P.) -- A jury has awarded the State of Indiana $25
million in damages in the case of "Indiana v. Music Television." Music
Television, also known as MTV, was accused of costing the state of Indiana
more than $100 million in additional educational expenses due to students
watching MTV when they should have been doing their homework. The jury
foreman in the case was quoted as saying, "Like, like the kids are, like,
goofin' off. Besides, MTV doesn't like play enough old stuff, like Zeppelin
and Floyd."

Following the various court decisions to award damages to states for
medical costs associated with smoking by state residents, a barrage of
similar lawsuits is happening across the country. School systems are suing
book publishers, movie makers, television broadcasters, shopping malls, and
miniature golf arcades. Makers of sports equipment are facing crippling
lawsuits by insurers. The last remaining American bicycle maker, Trek,
announced that it is withdrawing from the U.S. market, following the $37
million judgement against it in "Oregon v. Trek."
