Even though it may be obvious to the crypto-savvy people in CP, since this 
press release is directed at a somewhat wider audience it would be useful to 
point out that none of these recent terrorist incidents involved encryption 
at all.

Same point.  Unless you mention that encryption wasn't a factor at all, you 
risk leaving the (unsophisticated) reader with the implication that there 
was, indeed, some crypto angle to these incidents.  Like it or not, that's 
the way public discourse seems to be done these days:  Unless a point is 
specifically challenged, implicitly it is deemed ceded to the claimant.  

Sure, Clinton did not actually claim that encryption was a factor, but it 
was there by implication, and the average citizen seeing his proposals would 
come to that conclusion.   Denying this specifically, you'd be "points 
ahead" and would be in a better position to shut down those trying to 
restrict encryption.
