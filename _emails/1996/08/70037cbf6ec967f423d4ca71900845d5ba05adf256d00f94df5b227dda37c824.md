"I hope you die."  And the couple was arrestd for disorderly conduct by 
Chicago police.  Any possible federal charges for threatening a president 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 871 await a determination of the 
seriousness of the statement, in context with the wife's conduct, by 
prosecutors.  I predict no action.
