You want to elaborate on this contention?

If Alice transfers Digicash-type money to Bob, this is because Alice either
bought the DC-money someplace, or already had it, or otherwise arranged
with a bank to make the transaction. Maybe the bank "loaned" her money she
didn't already have, but this is a completely separable issue from the form
of DC-money.

So what is this "restraint on infinite spending-into-debt"? Gullible
lenders can always lend her vast amounts of money which she may never
repay, but this is fully separable from what transfer protocol she uses to
"spend" this loaned money.

If, on the other hand, your point is something about inflation, this is
also separable. Digicash and other forms of electronic money are generally
not currencies per se, but are a kind of transfer order, more like a check.
As such, not directly implicated in the issue of inflation.

No protocols. No anonymity. No protection against double-spending.

Looks promising. Keep us informed.
