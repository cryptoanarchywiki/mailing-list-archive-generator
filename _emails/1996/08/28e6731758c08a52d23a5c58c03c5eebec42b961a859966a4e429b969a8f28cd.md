Several people have given explanations of why your question is both too
simplistic and too tied to subjective definitions of "good for the
economy." You ignore these points and keep repeating your protectionist
mantra.

You seem to have a one-track mind, suggesting you are probaby a rabid
Objectivist. OK, so I will give you an Objectivist proof:

A is A. Not-A is not Not-Not-A. A is real, Not-A is not real. Reality is
good, non-reality is not good. Man exists in reality. Therefore Man is
good. Existence is not optional. Non-existence is nothingness. Nothingness
is darkness. The opposite of darkness is light. Fire produces light,
therefore fire is good. Fire is the embodiment of good. Smoking is the
embodiment of fire. Therefore, smoking is good. Non-smoking is bad....

What was the question again?

(P.S. Since Bart seems to have only one thing on his mind, and since our
list members seem unable to persuade him about anything, I suspect this
list is not the list for Bart. May he find the list he seeks.)

Boycott "Big Brother Inside" software!
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
