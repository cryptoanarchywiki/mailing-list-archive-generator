Or 'they' can use our Telco (Tel$tra) 's approach and introduce 
_timecharged_ local data calls as it is trying to do here in Australia.

What better or easier way to destroy our meagre outlet for free speech 
than to cost it out of existance.

See Stewart Fist's excellent article on the subject currently available 
on "The Australian" newspapers site:

<A HREF="http://www.australian.aust.com/computer/columns/fistcom.htm">

See also draft legislation at

<A HREF="http://www.dca.gov.au/govtpol.html">

and Universal Telco Service Obligations at

<A HREF="http://www.dca.gov.au/"> (many references) 

They took our firearms last month..they're comin back for the net this month.
