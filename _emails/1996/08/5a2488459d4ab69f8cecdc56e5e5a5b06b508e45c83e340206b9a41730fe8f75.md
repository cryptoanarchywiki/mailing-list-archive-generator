To those of you who are tired of the Republican National Convention.  And 
particularly to those who are ALREADY tired of the Democrat National 
Convention, despite the fact that it hasn't started yet.

Remember those irritating signs beside the road, advertising some new 
apartment complex or housing development that you pass on the way home?  You 
know, the ones which say, "If you lived here, you'd be home by now."

Well, as you watch these conventions (conventia?), imagine a sign on the 
Information Superhighway, just up ahead.  It says:

"If your country were operated under the principles of 'Assassination 
Politics', not only would this convention be over by now, it wouldn't have 
even started!"

We return you to your regularly scheduled farce.
