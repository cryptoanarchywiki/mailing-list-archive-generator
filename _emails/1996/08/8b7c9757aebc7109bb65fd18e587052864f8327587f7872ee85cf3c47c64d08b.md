I don't think this is giving Singapore's rulers the benefit of the doubt. 
Rather, it is a case of asking politely the first time.  Since it is asking
him to change a policy of his, it is merely avoiding calling him a shithead
in the process.  When you want someone to do something voluntarily, it is
usually better to start by being polite.

It is up to other net-forces to make sure that censorship is ineffective
for technical reasons.
