States and municipalities are taxing internet access.  Who wants to
make a prediction about if/when the IRS will start to count net access
as a taxable fringe benefit of employment?

(At a small company where I once worked, a tax accountant visiting
one day noticed that we had a weight bench set up in a back corner of
the big "back room".  He advised us to be careful, because the IRS
could count that as a taxable employee benefit.)
