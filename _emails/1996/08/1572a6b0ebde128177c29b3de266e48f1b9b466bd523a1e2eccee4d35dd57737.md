Butler Lampson and Rashid are both pretty hot. Cutler got NT

one. 

There are many computer companies that are full of Bozos,
Microsoft isn't one of them. Most of the people griping about

I'm interested that Navigator 3b6 crashes several times daily 
while Internet Explorer has yet to crash on me. I couldn't
care less about fancy features, at this stage I want a browser
that is reliable - like they used to be.
