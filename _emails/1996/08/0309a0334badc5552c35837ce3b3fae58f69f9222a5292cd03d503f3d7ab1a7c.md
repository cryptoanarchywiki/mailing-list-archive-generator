The Cato Institute Study.  AFDC+Food Stamps+Housing Assistance+Medicaid+WIC
= a fair chunk of change when compared to the taxed earnings from work.
Equivalent to the take-home pay from a $16/hour job in NYC (mostly because
of health insurance).  The commies complained that the study didn't account
for the fact that the working poor can also get food stamps and Earned
Income Tax Credit.  Of course, if you just establish the value of welfare
benefits, you are doing a lot.

The poverty rate calculations (how many people below the poverty level?) do
not include SS or welfare cash or non-cash benefits.  Thus people are not as
poor as claimed even ignoring unreported income from legal and illegal
employment.

Adding everything up, we find that poor households spend twice what they
officially report taking in.  Hardly surprising since if one has a low
income, one unreported job in the household can double that income.  It is
also likely that a higher proportion of the income and assets of the poor
are not recorded (as against the rich) because most of the assets are
personalty rather than realty and they are less likely to be audited, etc.

So the level of income and asset inequality in America is less than you will
have heard.
