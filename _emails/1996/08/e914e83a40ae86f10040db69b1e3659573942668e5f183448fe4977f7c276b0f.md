Lawyers out there can and should correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't
believe either the criminal or civil justice system has the concept of a
"John Doe" trial! The ability to have the advice of an attorney, to
confront one's accusers, cross-examine witnesses, and mount a defense, and
all that constitutional stuff. Rather hard to do if the trial is in the
past tense.

Can you cite an example of such a "John Doe" trial in the U.S.?

(There may be trials "in absentia," more so in other countries than in the
U.S., but not when no persons have been identified at all!)


--Tim May, who hopes he is never identified as the "John Doe" indicted,
tried, convicted, and sentenced in 1979 in Washington County, Oregon, for
the crime of unlawful foddering in a public place.
