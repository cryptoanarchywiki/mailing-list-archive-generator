Voiceprints used to be doable only with sophisticated, specialized 
equipment.  Presumably, they would be doable today with "only" a PC and 
soundcard, along with some software.  This raises an interesting question:  
Would it be possible to modify speech to remove the identifiable 
characteristics which came from the speaker, and replace them with those of 
some other person.  

In other words, could somebody fake a bomb threat using a recording which 
has been processed to sound "exactly" like some famous person whose voice 
you can analyze?
