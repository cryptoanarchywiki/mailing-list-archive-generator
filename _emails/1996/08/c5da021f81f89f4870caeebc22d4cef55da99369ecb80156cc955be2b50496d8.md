There was just such a decision in Washington state about a year ago, as I 
recall.  However, as I recall there has been a contradictory decision 
elsewhere, so the law isn't clear.

It seems to me that the main problem with such "evidence" is not the search 
itself, but the interpretation of the results:  Having a hot house isn't a 
crime, and indeed it was not practically detectable before IR viewers.  And 
an IR viewer only tells you the house is hot; it doesn't say why its hot.  
Apparently, when the "justice system" gets a new toy, it subtly adjusts its 
standards to use that toy, regardless of minor issues such as right and 
wrong.
