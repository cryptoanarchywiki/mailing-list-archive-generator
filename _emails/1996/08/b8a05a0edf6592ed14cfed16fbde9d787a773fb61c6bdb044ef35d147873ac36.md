I also wonder why universal service is such a Good Thing. It also, 
unfortunately, is on the agendas for the G-7-type meetings of information 
ministers from participating countries. http://www.eff.org/~declan/global/

(My objections to universal service are perhaps not surprising. It
devolves more power into the hands of the DC bureaucrats such as the FCC,
and provides a slippery slope on which we can slide down towards more and
more government regulation. By concentrating regulatory authority in the
Federal government, it also makes decisions more subsceptible to
special-interest lobbying and political patronage. But I recall Ronda has
been arguing for universal service for some time now, including on the
netizens mailing list.)
