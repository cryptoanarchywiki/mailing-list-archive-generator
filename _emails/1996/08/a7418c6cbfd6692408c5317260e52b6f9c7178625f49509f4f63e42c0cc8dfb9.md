Now imagine that I want to make that $100K investment or, more 
realistically, that I want to invest $100K in my kid's college education.
I'm going to have to earn wages of $160K and pay $60K in tax.  It would 
make me cranky if the guy next door could just clip $100K of coupons, tax 
free, to pay for his kid's education.

While I'm sure Steve Forbes could, I can't think of a moral argument why 
income from selling stock should be taxed at a rate lower (or higher) than 
than income from wages.

Jamie Whitten, late chairman of the House Appropriations Committee once 
said, "All anyone wants is a special advantage over the next fellow.  
Understand that, and you've understood the intent of every law ever passed."

I think that applies to tax law.
