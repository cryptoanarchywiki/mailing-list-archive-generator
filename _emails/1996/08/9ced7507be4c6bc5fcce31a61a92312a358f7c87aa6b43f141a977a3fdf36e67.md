Why would you need an "EM Cannon" for this?  Just string a 1-car-sized loop 
of wire on the surface of a road, and off in the bushes hide a battery, 
DC-to-Hi voltage DC converter and 20kv+ capacitor, and a vacuum switch or 
some other switch arrangement.  When the car in question traverses the loop, 
short the switch and the car will be blasted with 20,000 volt-turns of 
induction.  Sure, most of it will pass harmlessly through the car's steel, 
but even iron has a limited "mu" which means that every electrical device in 
the car will be subjected to a certain amount of induced EMF, probably 
enough to at least reset a few microprocessors and possibly even destroy them.
