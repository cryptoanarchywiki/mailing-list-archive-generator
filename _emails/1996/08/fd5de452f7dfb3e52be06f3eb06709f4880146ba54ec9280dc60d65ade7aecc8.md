Bill speaks sooth. Personally, I agree with Jean-Francois in that the
Singapore government *does* understand the Net, and is using that
knowledge to control it within their borders reasonably well. Remember the
next phase of restrictions goes into effect on September 15. 

But I don't see a problem in being polite the first time.
