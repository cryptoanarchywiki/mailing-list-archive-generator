As someone who was married in NYC during the 65 blackout *happened at 1716
-- the blackout , the wedding at 1705, I have watched with interest the
attempt to explain that blackout and how to prevent such. We have not
progressed very far. The avalanche behavior of power systems is still not
well understood and techniques to prevent such failures are not obvious.
Same can be said of telephone and computer networks at different levels.
