But if the park was a private one, would it make any difference?

Between the "right" of being left alone, and the "legitimate needs" of
law enforcers to frisk suspicious looking characters - whether in public
or in private places - it seems rather difficult to draw that dividing
line between allowance and forbearance.

 I mean, either it is, or it isn't, a "right".   When could it really be
okay to violate that definition.  How are the law enforcers to do their
job if they can't intrude into your shopping bag, when it's a critical
National Emergency.  This is what Denning is always referring to.
