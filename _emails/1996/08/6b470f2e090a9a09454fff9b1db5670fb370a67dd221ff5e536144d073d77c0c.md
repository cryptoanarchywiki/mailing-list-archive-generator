maybe i should have taken something, then i would have learned to spell. yes, i
know that the correct spelling is 'paid', not 'payed', but sometimes, (often?),
my fingers outrun my brain. does this, you ask, also account for the lack of
uppercase characters? no, it's just my style, maybe its really laziness.

cheers,

ps. you will undoubtly also find a few tath, thta, teh, and the like.
 maybe if i used that microsoft stuff with the spell checker rather than the 
sun mailtool i could present myself without the plethora of typos. sigh.
