The aspect of the cocaine trade in Miami that is tied up with a conspiracy
to kidnap the mascot of the Miami Dolphins involves "very little" money.
This is not to suggest that the cocaine importation trade as a whole
involves "very little" money.

The supposed Contra Connection -- which as originally made up was not
supposed to involve Miami, by the way, but primarily CA, LA, and TX --
involves "very little" money relative to the Contra budget, and even less
considering how little was supposed to have been passed on, and "very
little" money relative to the total drug trade.

Me too. Only wacky conspiracy theories should be called wacky conspiracy
theories. No, you never suggested the above -- as I said, I heard it mostly
on KPFK, a far-left, "Black Nationalist"-friendly radio station in Los
Angeles associated with the Pacifica Foundation, in the mid-80's. It would
be rather difficult to confuse them with you. :-) I include this example to
indicate where the story originated.

My academic advisor was Terry Karl, a rather sharp critic of the CIA and a
specialist on Central America. I spent a decade on Latin American policy
issues. I personally spoke with Mr. Calero at a (well-picketed) reception at
Stanford in 1989. I had classmates from Nicaragua. Speculative
rumor-mongering by Beltway journalists who can't even read Spanish doesn't
impress me.

In other words, they deny it, so it must be true.

This is backwards. The loons on the left started the story. In 1986, the
press and academia investigated the story, and concluded there was really
nothing to it. Even Chomsky, who welcomes any opportunity to "prove"  a
world conspiracy against leftists, rejected it (this is the same guy who
bought the Allende assassination myth until shortly before Barricada and
Mistral retracted it). Ten years later, another set of loons is trying to
interest the press in a laundered story. A couple of CBS reporters were
trolled, briefly.

Likewise.
