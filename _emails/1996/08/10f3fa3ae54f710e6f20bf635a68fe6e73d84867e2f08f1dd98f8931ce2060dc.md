Nor was there any activity from the authorities.

A while back, when Vince first started advertizing his site, I asked him a few
hypothetical questions, and he said roughly this: If client X posts something
to Usenet from Vince's site, and if Y dislikes X's article so much that he
mailbombs X, then Vince would pull X's plug. (I have the exact quote saved.)
I lost interest right then. I'm not surprised that Vince acted dishonorably by
pulling a client's plug with no warning for a very flimsy reason.
