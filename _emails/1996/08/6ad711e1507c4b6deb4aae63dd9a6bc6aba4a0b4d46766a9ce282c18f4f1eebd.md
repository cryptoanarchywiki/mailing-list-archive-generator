  Funny, they didn't leave an email address?
  Probably don't even know what lists this is be posted to!

 
  For the money you probably get info on how to call your
  mortgage company and find out if makeing smaller/earlier payments
  will reduce the principle and the interest re-caculated.
  Then invest the money you save to earn interest!
  
  I know several people who do this.  You don't make extra payments
  just divde your $1000 month (or whatever) into 3 $333.33 payments.
  You need a sizable principle/long term loan for this to
   be worthwhile, and of course a properly worded mortgage.
