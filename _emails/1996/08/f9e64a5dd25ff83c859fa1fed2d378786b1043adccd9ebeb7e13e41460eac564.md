As an attorney I can say that not only would I happily represent anyone
Mr. Holt sued for libel, but I would consider my contingency fee a free
lunch.  I wouldn't even bother preparing for the pre-trial hearing.

Truth, afterall, is an absolute defense to libel.

Your threat to sue is, clearly, merely an attempt to stifle any effort to
criticize your product.

I believe a more accurate legal view is that you are committing fraud by
misrepresenting "The Pouch" as a more potent implementation than it really
is.

You state:

This position has been refuted by at least one expert on this list.

I would remind you that each and every sale you make of this product, when
based on material misrepresentation, constitutes a fraud.  If made by
wire, as these sales seem they may, they represent wire fraud.  That's one
count of fraud and one count of wire fraud.  If a check is sent to you via
mail, that's a count of mail fraud to boot.

As you have been warned now of the flaws in your system, I don't think you
have much of a defense unless you can produce some experts to support your
own view of the cipher.  I won't hold my breath.

I am constantly amazed that people advertize new crypto products on this
list and then whine when they are literally decimated as to their
technical merit.

Go sell to children if your product can't stand the intelligence of
adults.
