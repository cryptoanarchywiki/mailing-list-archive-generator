Change your MAC address to be the same as the hub's. 3Com recently fixed
this. Others might not have.

That was true six months ago, but 3Com, Allied, Cabletron, Synoptics, HP,
UB, and others now include it as a matter of course. Asante is the notable
exception. There are some kooks out there, like the people at RIT, who think
that everyone needs switched ports; and a few cheapskates, like management
at a major university in the Palo Alto area, who stick with Asante because
it's cheapest, and trust students to be nice (or at least nice enough to get
caught).

Sure they do. You'd have a reasonable assurance that wherever you went,
you'd be the only one seeing your packets -- assuming the backbone is
secure, which you need to assume anyway if you're not doing packet, session,
or application-layer encryption (which is the ultimate goal). The roving
portable computer is a pretty common case nowadays. The only thing a static
table gets you is intruder control.
