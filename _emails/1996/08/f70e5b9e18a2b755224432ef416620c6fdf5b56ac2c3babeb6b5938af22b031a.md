Absent any ability to cite a chapter-and-verse for making such a statement, 
and considering the vagueness of it, I would suggest that it either be 
clarified, justified, or removed.

I would think that, in it's present form, that statement leaves Luckman in 
no small amount of jeopardy: if true, but misunderstood because of lack of 
reference, anyone violating it may seek redress against Luckman in the 
event of prosecution by some law enforcement agency. If untrue, Luckman 
could be considered equally liable for any real or perceived lost income 
because of an erroneous limitation, when it's incorrectness is discovered.

David,

to my knowledge- it's the latter. U.S. prevents Verisign from deploying 
keys
greater than 512 bits to Web servers outside the U.S.. And no, I can't
tell you the Federal Regulation, Title, Section. 

>"Also, please note that you cannot send keys longer than 512 to servers 
>outside the United States."
>
>I would like to ask for clarification on this point. Is this meant to say 
>that a server inside the United States is not allowed to use a 512+ bit 
key 
>with a client outside the U.S., or that a Web Commander server outside the 
>U.S. may not employ a key of greater than 512 bits? In either case, what 
is 
>the justification for such a statement/restriction? If a Federal 
>regulation, could you please cite the Title and Section?
