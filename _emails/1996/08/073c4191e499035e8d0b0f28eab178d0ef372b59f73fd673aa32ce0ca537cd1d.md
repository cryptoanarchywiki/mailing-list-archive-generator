C'punks,

I've just had an insight with regard to Bart's ongoing capital 
debate.  In response to Perry's "green pylon" post, Bart wrote:

Bart's error lies in his confusion of the terms "captial" and
"capital investment."  While capital may be used to make capital
investments, there are other things it can be spent for as well
(wages, taxes, supplies, etc.).  

If Bart were to use the term "infrastructure" then it would be
clear that the ebb and flow of mere capital would have relatively
little to do with infrastructure influenced wages.
