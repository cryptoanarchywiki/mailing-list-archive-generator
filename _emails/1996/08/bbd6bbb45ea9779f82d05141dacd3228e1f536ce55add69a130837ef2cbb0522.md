So civily dealing with a net abuser gives you the creeps?  THAT gives ME the 
creeps, honestly.

We /all/ pay for our access.  Most of us work, most of us pay for the paper,
most of us put up with ads.  Spam is the price of free speech.  One must 
either, in minor cases, ignore it and move on, so as not to encourage; or, in
case of extravagent abuse, send word to the isp, spread the word on the net
that xxx.com is a spammer's haven (and otherwise discouraging further 
memberships), as well as filling the sysadmin's mailbox until the spammer is
deleted and we can all move on again.

It's not a load of crap, it's reality.  Everything provided for civil use and
enjoyment will be abused repeatedly, it's all in how we deal with it.

Greetings from $hell,
Daniel.
