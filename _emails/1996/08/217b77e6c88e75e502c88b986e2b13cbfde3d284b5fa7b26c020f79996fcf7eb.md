Thanks to DL for noting this report. 
 
 
   8-31-96. WaPo: 
 
   "New Airport Bomb Plan Considered. Computer Profiles, 
   High-Tech Detectors Central to System" 
 
      A presidential commission on aviation security is 
      considering a bomb detection plan that would require 
      U.S. airlines to scrutinize all passengers at U.S. 
      airports using massive computer files to identify 
      potential terrorists or other suspicious individuals. 
 
      The plan would require creation of a computer profiling 
      system that would examine passengers' bill-paying 
      records, flying habits and much other data to determine 
      which checked baggage should undergo examination by 
      sophisticated explosives detection equipment. 
 
      Numerous legal issues still need to be resolved, 
      including thorny civil liberties questions such as 
      whether the airlines would be given access to 
      information from government computer systems like those 
      containing criminal records. 
 
      Would the airlines store information on individuals? 
      Would they go out and seek information from credit 
      bureaus and other private sources?
