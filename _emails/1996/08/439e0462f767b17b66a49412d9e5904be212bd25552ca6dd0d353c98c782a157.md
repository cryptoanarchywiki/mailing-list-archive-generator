The first axiom of economics is "Wants are unlimited."  I'm glad that
they're "shipping all those jobs overseas."  The more people we have working
the more goodies are produced.  If the labor of US workers is freed up, then
they can go about producing something else valuable that they didn't have
time to produce before because those "third worlders" weren't doing their
fair share back when they were trapped in feudalism or fabian socialism.
You can't get more stuff (wealth) unless everyone is out there working to
capacity (consistent with their desired work/leisure tradeoff).
