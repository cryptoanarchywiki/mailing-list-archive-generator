	It sounds like the "smart cards" will have some chip oddities to try
to prevent reading them - something in TCMay's department. I do wonder whether
they're going to have one key for all of them, or differing keys for each user.
If the former, then cracking one (which I get the impression is quite possible)
equals cracking all, of course.

	Yes... although it could be rather inconvenient.

	One hopes that the level of encryption will be required to be above
single DES, at least...
