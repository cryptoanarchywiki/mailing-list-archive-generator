Again on today's CBS all-news stn.
An elementary school teacher arrested for exchanging, or whatever, 
kiddieporn on the Internet.

The reporter was duly dramatic and ominous sounding.

Damn I wish I knew how many kiddie porners were doing their whatver OFF 
the 'net.  Maybe, my fine friends, we're catching MORE o' them because 
they are on the net and clueless, rather than in back alleys and hard to 
find.
