i'm not exactly sure what an acid bomb is, but according to my book, The 
Anarchist Cookbook, that I bought in 1972 (was the internet around back 
then?), there is a compound called "picric acid" that is "more powerful 
than TNT, but has some disadvantages". 

if you'd like the recipe, I'll be more than happy to mail you it through 
the US Postal system. Wouldn't want to give the Internet any more of a 
bad name for distributing subversive materials.

There is also instructions on using an inverted vial of sulpheric acid, 
that will then eat thu the stopper at the top (bottom) of the vial. when 
the acid makes it thru, then is mixes with Potassium Chloride and causes 
a small explosion which sets off the larger explosion in the dynomite 
packed around it. 

just thot you'd like to know.



thanks,
conrad
