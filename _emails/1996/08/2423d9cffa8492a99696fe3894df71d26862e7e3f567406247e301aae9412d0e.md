   You of course are assuming they are using a Unix box. I commonly offload
the etc/passwd file to my pc (p-100) and run Crackerjack against the file.
With a single username a 5 meg wordlist will run in about 30 seconds
(mileage will vary).
    The concept is certainly interesting and is another case for good
passwords. Of course you need to get the password file first which is
another story for another group.

     While I believe this is possible feasable is another story.
