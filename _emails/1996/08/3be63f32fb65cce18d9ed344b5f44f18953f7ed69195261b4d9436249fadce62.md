The only ideal I can think of would be the fictional "Port Watson".  What
is you had a system that spanned countries, using the internet as a linking
device.  It would be the same service.  But when you specified the kind of
data you wanted to post, the system would route it to the appropriate
server in a country where it wasn't illegal.
