Where do I begin? First, what does "taking jobs away from us" mean? That we
own these jobs? And who is "us"?

And as for locking people in buildings until they meet a goal, I'd say
that's a pretty fair description of Silicon Valley start-ups. :-}

This kind of protection did not work 150-200 years ago, when the
"Colonists" figured out to make fabric in mills and how to mechanize
factories--they ended up "stealing" the industry the Brits thought they had
sewn up. Life goes on.

Essentially all of the technologies we talk about on this list work toward
erasing national boundaries, much as Singapore and the U.S. might find this
distasteful.

Indeed you are. I would be interested in hearing a more coherent argument
for your case, though.

Given that our list is international, with active contributors from Sweden,
India, Germany, Cyberia, and even Singapore, I rather doubt many of them
see strong crytography, anonymous remailers, denationalized money, and
crypto anarchy as a means of propping up the government or the economy of
the United States of America.
