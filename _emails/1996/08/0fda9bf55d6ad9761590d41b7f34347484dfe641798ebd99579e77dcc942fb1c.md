Yes, that does indeed sound silly.  BTW, the UNABOMer's secret ID number,
used to identify various communications with the NYT as being his, is
reported (Mad Genius and a government deposition) to be 553-25-4394, which
allegedly turned out to be the SSN of a prisoner somewhere in California.
I suppose it's not useful for this application, since it belongs to
somebody who might need it again sometime.
