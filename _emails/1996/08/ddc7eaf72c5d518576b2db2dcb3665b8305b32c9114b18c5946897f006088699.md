What vulnerabilities? I've heard tell of some(?) that "leak" unscrambled 
packets if flooded with extreme traffic levels, but have never seen or 
verified this. Got any specifics?

Most manufacturers offer SNMP-manageable hubs, but these don't offer 
MAC-layer security. That usually costs a lot extra. The MAC-layer feature 
is not widely used.

If it is Ethernet (or any baseband technology, AFAIK), and on coax, then 
of course it is "promiscuous." All devices must see the packet; they're 
on a bus. The 10T hubs also follow the "all devices must see the packet 
rule", but by design; a packet is received on the "recieve" pair of one 
port, and transmitted on the "xmit" pairs of all ports. The secure hubs 
overwrite the data payload with "junk" first - no encryption involved, 
nothing to crack, and, as you've pointed out, without recomputing CRC.

btw - if I were in an apartment environment, I'd want the "secure hubs",
and would verify that they're actually in the secure mode. They usually
have a "learning" mode, where they simply register the MAC address most
recently assigned to each port (sort of like learning bridges - this saves
a lot of manual entry). Of course, if left in this mode, they don't do a
thing for security. On the flip side, if sucured, and you change network
cards, or bring that laptop home from the office, etc. you won't be able
to use it without the intervention of the hub's administrator. 

And yes, packet sniffers are easy to get a hold of; freeware is abundant. 
Anyone can easily use one on a segment they've got access to.
