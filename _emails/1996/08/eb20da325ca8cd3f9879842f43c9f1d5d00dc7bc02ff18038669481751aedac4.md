In the way that you suggest, I would argue it is not possible.  You cannot
ever have a "DataHaven" in a single jurisdiction.  As Mr. Cate notes,
there is no jurisdiction that will fit the bill, nor do I ever expect
that one will be created.

The trick is to get the ISP to exist in cyberspace, or ever will it be
subject to the whim of the local authority.

This is a key and very important distinction.

I have advocated the approach, but as applied to service providers, not
users of service providers.
