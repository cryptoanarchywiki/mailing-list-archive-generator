Then one reaches the absolutely unteniable position that the light
reflected off the criminal while he shoots the victim 5 times in the chest
in cold blood cannot be intercepted by a law enforcement officer (or if we
extend your citizen = law enforcement officer analogy, also a citizen)
without a warrant.

The crux of the argument is the "expectation of privacy" reasoning laid
down in e.g., Katz v. U.S., 389 U.S. 347 (1967) ("What a person knowingly
exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of
Fourth Amendment protection.... But what he seeks to preserve as private,
even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally
protected."); California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35 (1988); Smith v.
Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979) ("A person has no legitimate expectation of
privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties.") and
Florida v. Riley, 488 U.S. 445 (1989) (Involving the warrantless "search"
of a greenhouse from a helocopter 400 feet above).

All the "but it's modulated" arguments in the world mean nothing.

I understand your position, unfortunately the Supreme Court simply does
not agree with you.

Exactly, so the law prevented anyone who felt like it from breaking the
law with impunity because of a little box.  That's obstruction of justice.
"Well sure I slow down when I see a police officer, so I'm obeying the
law."

You also have to be carefuly about arguing for or against the legitimacy
of the law intermixed with arguments about the legitimacy of enforcement.

Well, this position is highly subjective and so broad as to be a bit
suspect.  What about beat cops?  I could read the above to prohibit them.

Sit around and wait until called, is that your position?

I'm not saying it's reasonable or unreasonable, just a bit extreme.

Again, this is subjective.  I don't much like speed enforcement either,
but one could as easly say "cops staking out a suspected site of a robbery
and hiding in vans or other such tactics are not law enforcement."

Well, I think this ignores their anticipated deterrant effect, which goes
directly to public safety, but this is going way afield.

Well, I tend to side with you, believe it or not, but your position is a
bit idealistic.  One must also approach the practical needs of law and
order.

The above is incorrect.  There are MANY instances where police are
empowered to affect warrentless searches.

State action and private action, a very serious and bright line
distinction exists.

Your argument amounts to the existance of bright line constitutionally
protected "areas."  This argument is an interesting one but it poses many
many practical problems and has been explicitly rejected by the Supreme
Court.

You must remember, the only sanction for violating the rule is exclusion.
Police can monitor it all they like, they just can present it as evidence.
So, if they were to monitor it and discover that it contained no
modulation, what's the harm?  If they discover modulation, they go for a
warrant.

No, it was pointing out the difference between a communication and a blank
shirt.  What is on the shirt may be irrelevant, but the fact that it says
something is not.

In any event, I propose we move this to private mail.
