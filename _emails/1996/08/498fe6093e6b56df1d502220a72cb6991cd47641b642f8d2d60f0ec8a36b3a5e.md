Oh I was just being paranoid I guess. There used to be JavaScript that would
automatically send email from a page. something like 

<html>
<body onLoad="document.mailme.submit()">
<form method=post name="mailme"
action="mailto:john@vertexgroup.com?subject=user address">
<input type=hidden name="userAddress" value="done">
</form>
</body>
</html>

But even if that still works it would be a good trick to associate it with a
cookie.
