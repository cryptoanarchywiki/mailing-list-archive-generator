    No, what this guy heard was a book report. I don't know how
well a writer Mr. Hager is but if he doesn't have proper documentation
then he confirms nothing.

    If anyone cares to look up the political history of the western
Pacific rim, it would seem very suspicious that N.Z and Australia would
have any intelligence commitment with France at all.

    If the PM has no credibility (his saying he knew nothing) how does
his input add credibility to the book?

    Those of us in-the-know won't be reevaluating anything. Save your
money and wait for the book to get into the local library. Better to
spend your money on David's book on Enigma.
