    The paying company has a tax return of it's own, which will be used 
to show how much was paid (actually or constructively) to Mr X.

The IRS doesn't usually get it's indictments from circumstantial 
evidence. It gets them from the pissed off underlings who see Joe Cool 
Mr X getting away with shit they can't.

How many secretaries, payroll clerks, human-relations staffers, etc, will 
be seeing the chain of paperwork that is generated by the "arrangement"?  
They know how normal payroll is handled. Some tiny percentage of these 
sheep are alert enough to put two and two together.... and it's all 
downhill from there.

Let us recall how the (apparent) (alleged) UNabomber was identified....
