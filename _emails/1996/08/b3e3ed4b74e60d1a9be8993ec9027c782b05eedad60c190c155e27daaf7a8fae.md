Mr. Curtin;

You are too kind. I suspect that 'The Pouch' is a piece of junk,
although the lack of public disclosure makes it impossible to
demonstrate that. If Mr. Holt would like to sue me, he's invited
to. I'm sure he'll be at least as likely to follow up as Karl
Denninger or "Dr." Fred C. Cohen.
