Liar.  You know very well that Stormfront-L is not representative of net 
racismo.  It appears unusually intelligent vs. usenet racists is because 
of Don Black's moderation.  There aren't constant interruptions by Andrew 
Mathis, Mike Beebe, ara, scoop, sexy Jeanne Kapowski, etc., threatening 
to rape, mutilate, poison and murder racists, thanks to Mr. Black.  You 
also know very well that numbers of mailing list subscribers do not 
translate to active interest in a newsgroup.  How popular would 
comp.cypherpunks be if it was created and propagated?  FAR more popular 
than anyone would expect from a mere 1,000 or so current subscribers.  In 
fact, this is your's and tcmay, Sameer, shamrock, etc., duty to write a 
RFD and CFV for an UNMODERATED comp.cypherpunks newsgroup.  On second 
thought, you SHOULDN'T participate because you censor by moderation 
yourself as a power trip.  You know, in hindsight, I think I hurt the 
r.m.w-p effort more than helped, I only posted to usenet about it and 
avoided mail.  I shouldn't have respected cypherpunks enough to refuse to 
follow your practice of trolling against racists on the mailing list, I 
should have confined my campaign to cypherpunks.  Another example, does 
the 40 or so subscribers to coder-punks indicate there is very little 
interest in coding for crypto-@nonymity?!??????

Liar.  Either post your entire copy to alt.revisionism or prove yourself 
a lying capitali$t bastard who's jealous about Zuendel because you are a 
J$wish preppie homo$exual righti$(t) ri(c)h pig.

Prove it, liar.  I can prove the opposite with just these examples: 
racist terrorism, Oklahoma City, Vipers, J$ws, Microsoft, Holocaust, 
capitali$m, flying saucers, penny stocks, etc.

Why do you pretend to be Ingrid in your latest post?  Are you jealous of 
the pretty woman you'll never have because of your difficulties with 
those sort of things?
