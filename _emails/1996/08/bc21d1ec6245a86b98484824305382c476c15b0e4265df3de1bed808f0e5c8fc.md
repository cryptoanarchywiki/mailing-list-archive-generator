   Which alternate universe are you in, Chris, where employers don't want
to DECLARE AND DEDUCT their salary expenses - every last penny of it? 
Which planet is that, where a company can afford to set up a structural
cost in its operations, that its competitors don't have?

There are ways around the taxation problem, but they don't involve hiding 
facts from the US Govt. This is the cold, hard reality. Get used to it.
