I remember a time when Privacy Commissioners were a new thing. Their
primary purpose seemed to be to sanction government access to (and keeping
of) large databases on the activities of the population. Their secondary
purpose was to prevent the private sector competition from doing the same.
Eliminating access to such data by the individual in the process.

Things may have changed for the better, but I doubt it.
