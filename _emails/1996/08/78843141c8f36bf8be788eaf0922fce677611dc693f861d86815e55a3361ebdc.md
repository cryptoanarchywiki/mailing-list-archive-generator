In Netscape 3.0, the program allows the user to specify which encryption
standards to allow connections with.  It allows encryption with 128-bit RC4,
128-bit RC2, and 156-bit(I think)3DES.  Of these three, which would be the
most secure method?  It is possible to restrict all secure connects to be of
3DES only for example.  What would be the most secure way to go, DES or RC4?
this is the newly released US-Only downloadable copy of Netscape 3.0
