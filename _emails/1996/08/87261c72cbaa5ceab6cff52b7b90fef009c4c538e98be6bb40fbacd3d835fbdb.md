I repeat.  Generations of sweating engineers have discovered and confirmed 
that there is not an easy, "Silver Bullet" cure of the canonical problem 
of shielding electromagnetic energy from reaching someone who knows how 
to interpret it.

Bill, you are welcome to look at a layer of tin foil and give a sigh of 
relief that you've shielded your gun or your crypto diskette or your 
private body parts feom someone who knows what they're doing.  Go ahead, 
chant a mantra too, if it makes you feel better.
