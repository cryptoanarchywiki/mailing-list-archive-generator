The default (at least on beta-2 of ie) is to not trust anyone unless you
explicity say so.  If the user then decides to execute "k3wl kontro1" from
phreak.net then that's their problem.

Does anyone know what the legal implications of signed code are?  That is,
if Company A signs their Active X control and it's later found to corrupt
users data, does the signature (which is supposed to make the user trust
the control as safe), open up the company to litigation for damages?
