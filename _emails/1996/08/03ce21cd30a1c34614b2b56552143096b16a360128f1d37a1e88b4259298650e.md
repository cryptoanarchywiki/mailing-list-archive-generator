You could probibly build little clip on active jammers.  (With published
specs to the "Evil Internet(tm)".)  Such intrusive methods should be pretty
easy to screw up with proper detail on their operation.  (I expect the 2600
crowd will have jammer kits available soon.  And working ones a few months
after that...)

I want one that will make me show up as a multi-tentacled alien horror from
beyond space and time.  Why make them wig out and shoot you when you can
really mess with their minds...?
