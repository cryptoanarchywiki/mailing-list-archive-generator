I *finally* managed to get through to the 1-800 number that pops up when an 
attempted download of 128-bit MSIE 3.0 fails. They can only send out 
128-bit version *2.0*, it seems. They referred me to the 1-800 Sales 
number, but of course, the sales droids weren't savvy enough to understand 
the problem, and tried to hand me off to a 206 area code number. At that 
point, I called off the drill - I'm not going to pay for a toll call to fix 
MS's screwup.

"original" 800 number: 1-800-455-2959
Alternate 800 number: 1-800-426-9400 (autobot) - select 3, then 4, then 1 
to get a Real Person.

Anyone else upset about being denied might want to give them a call, too. 
Who knows, maybe if they get enough calls, they'll send someone to fix it.

Dave
