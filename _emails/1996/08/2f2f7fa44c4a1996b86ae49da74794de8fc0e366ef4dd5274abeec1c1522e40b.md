It does seem really odd, doesn't it?  But look at it this way:  The only 
reason the knuckle-dragging conservatives are able to take the moral 
high-ground on this and other net-freedom issues is because the OTHER 
"unrependant liberals" have inexplicably abandoned the correct side of the 
argument.  The fact that the conservatives are right may seem odd, but the 
behavior of the liberals is truly astonishing.
