They'll need it.  However, we can assume that POLDCs (Plain Old 
Long-Distance Companies) will fight back.  The easiest thing for them to do 
would be to offer a single-payment-per-year, unlimited-use LD telephone 
service for maybe $10 per month or so.  If, as various people have 
suggested, half the cost for LD is billing and customer service, they'll cut 
their costs by a factor of two and still make money.  This would take the 
wind out of the sails of domestic LD; it is unclear whether foreign LD would 
follow suit.
