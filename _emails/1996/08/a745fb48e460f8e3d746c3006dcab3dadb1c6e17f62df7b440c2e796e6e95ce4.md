As with offshore buoys, how long do you think such an entity would last?

You mentioned Greepeace...don't forget that the French intelligence
apparatus sunks a Greenpeace ship in a New Zealand harbor. Don't forget the
way the U.S. mined Managua's harbor. And so on.

Think of how any of these schemes are vulnerable to a cheap torpedo,
"anonymously mailed" from several miles away.

Oil rigs, buoys, pirate ships....these are all examples of hopelessly
insecure systems. I could say more, but what's the point?
