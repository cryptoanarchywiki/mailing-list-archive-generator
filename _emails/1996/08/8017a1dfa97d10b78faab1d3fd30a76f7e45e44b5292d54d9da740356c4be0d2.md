Hey folks, relax eh?

Its generally best when the police don't release every bit of
information on their investigations as they progress. Far from
criticising the police for having investigated Jewell on no or little
evidence you should criticise them for telling us about the evidence
they do have.

Although prosecuting a security guard in order to rob the terrorists of
publicity is a cute trick I don't think the US authorities are that
smart. In the past USGov has been less than sparkling in its ability to
keep a lid on secrets like that.
