I don't see how that last statement follows anything that went before.  I 
made it explicitly clear that companies have a right to market in such ways; 
I also have a right to dislike those methods.  

As for other libertarians, I don't see that they're appreciably different.  So 
where did that last comment come from? 

BTW, your KOTM credential is outdated...are you trying to have it renewed?
