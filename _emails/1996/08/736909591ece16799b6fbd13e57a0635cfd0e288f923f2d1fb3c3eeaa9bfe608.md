(BTW, I read the list, so no need to send carbons to me, or carbon-based
units. or carbon-based citizen-units.)

I'm skeptical. To paraphrase Dr. Strangelove, what use is such a data base
if cops and agents don't know it exists? (Granted, useful in a few
exceptional cases, even if field offices and agents are unaware that it
exists, but not useful for many cases.)

If such a voiceprint database, obtained surreptitiously through National
Technical Means (tm), were to exist and be known to exist by investigators,
word of its existence would leak out quickly enough.

This is just my opinion, of course. But, as the Martian watchers say,
extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. Do you _know_, that such
a data base exists? (A data base of, say, more than 5% of all the adults in
the U.S., in a data base that is searchable by voice print match to samples
submitted by FBI or other law enforcement agents.)

Sure, we all know--or should know--what the _capabilities_ are,
technically. But capability !=! actuality.

I doubt such a data base of voice prints exists.
