	They are, of course, failing to answer the question of why encouraging
people to consume _computer-generated_ child pornography should be considered
a justification for legal intervention, not to mention that such an effort
would also make putting _Lolita_ on the Internet illegal (text could drive
up demand for it as well, after all), or even political speech such as from
NAMBLA. (It's political speech just as much as material from neo-Nazis... or
from the Demopublicans.)
	There is also the lack of realization that someone can't be "exploited"
except in the Marxist sense on the Internet... only when the material is
originally made. Another point is that countries do differ on when is
considered old enough for voluntary participation in making pornography -
Tracy Lords material is legal in much of Europe, for instance.
	I'd also point to the media bias evident; they only quoted from
people who were in favor of governmental regulation. Fortunately, as even
one of the people at this "world congress" admitted, governmental regulation
of free speech on the Internet will ultimately fail. Prevent actual harm -
the _production_ of child pornography.
