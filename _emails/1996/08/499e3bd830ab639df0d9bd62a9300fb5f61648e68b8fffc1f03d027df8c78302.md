I was downtown Seattle at night time (early morning), walking around, minding 
my own business. Probably not actively maintaining public decorum, but
certainly 
not doing anything unorderly.  A cop approached me and asked what I was doing,
I told him none of his business.  He asked me for my ID, I said why, am I under
arrest?  He said no, but he needs to see my ID.  I told him he has no right to
ask me for my ID, especially when I've been doing nothing wrong, if I wanted to 
live in those conditions, I'd move to Iraq or China or something.  I got out my 
handy pocket tape recorder, and asked him to state his name and repeat his
request 
for the benefit of my lawyer who'd be contacting him. At this point the few
other 
people on the street had sort of gathered a few yards away, and the cop decided
he wasn't gonna win this one, so asked me to return to my home and left before
I could respond.  You are right, "Clean and dressed up people are rarely IDed 
[read harassed] on foot."  I'm not concerned for the clean and dressed up
people 
(with regards to police abuse), I'm concerned about the majority of people who 
aren't.  (For the record, I'm generally clean, but *rarely* dressed up. =) )

When I flew from Philadelphia about a year ago, they required one picture ID
and one other ID, just like most stores when you want a check cashed.  I still
don't like it, but I have less of a problem presenting ID when I am seeking
a service of some kind.  It is unacceptable to be asked for ID when I am merely
walking around a public street.
