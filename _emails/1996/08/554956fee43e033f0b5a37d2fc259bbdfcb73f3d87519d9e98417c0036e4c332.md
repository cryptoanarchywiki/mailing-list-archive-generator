One of NSA's traditional roles is to automatically scan communications and
pull out the "interesting" stuff.  To continue this role, they have to be
able to decrypt the messages.  I wouldn't, particularly when thinking in
paranoid mode, assume they have given up on that role.

I was assuming program only once chips, like the old burn-the-fuse PROMs. 
If you are ordering in quantity 700,000, for the RC4-40 engine, then you
have no need to worry about the cost of small runs of Mask programmed
chips.

If they are using Programmable-only-once Gate Arrays or Mask programmed
ones, $700 million for a machine which will cost $7 million for a simple
reprogramming might give them pause.  Or at least make them consider if
there is an alternative.  If they are using easily reprogrammable arrays,
then they have a general purpose computer specialized for certain types of
parallel processing.  If this machine cost $100 million, I agree they would
probably build it.

I feel like I'm leaning over backwards to defend NSA's response, an
extremely uncomfortable position (and I could crack my skull when I fall)
:-).  The most important issue is, what is NSA's state of the art.  If we
accept their $1000/FPGA chip, then they are indeed at the bleeding edge,
and suffering from the associated low chip yields.  If they are at the best
cost-performance point for 2-3 years ago or whenever they started approving
the export of RC4-40, then they are certainly subject to David Wagner's
performance limits.

A number of people have mentioned the heat problems.  I, and I think also
NSA, never said they couldn't be solved, but solving them involves
engineering costs, whether it is to design cooling or distribution
techniques.  I think the bullets in their response were primarily to
justify that $10 million NRE cost.  (Getting to $10 million isn't hard on a
government project.)

Given this kind of hardware, the only reasonable assumption is that if NSA
hasn't built a general purpose cracking engine, they will.

The idea of a genetic system to "learn" an unknown cypher system and then
brute force crack it is indeed worth a paper, perhaps several.
