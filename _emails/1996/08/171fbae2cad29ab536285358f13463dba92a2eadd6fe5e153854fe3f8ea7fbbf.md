>Reacting to pressure from Scotland Yard, the Internet Service Providers

>A computer consultant in Oregon paid the state $222 for its complete motor
>vehicles data base, which he then posted to a Web site, prompting charges
>of privacy violations from people who complained that he had invaded their
>privacy.  The database allows anyone with an Oregon license plate number to

>(Associated Press 8 Aug 96)

	At least they mentioned that it was publically available... but I don't
see any difference between net.availability and physical.availability.
