Sing Sing (the country is now a prison, so...) is one of the states we
should think about targetting for "special attention." Not in the sense of
violence, but in the sense of offering help to freedom fighters, those who
want to use stego, web proxies, etc.

I wonder what would happen if "Computers, Freedom, and Privacy '98" was
held in Sing Sing?
