Yes, but I can also see why its a bad idea to put somebody's VIN on the
Net... A clever terrorist would simply plant peices of metal with some
other loser's VIN's in their car before blowing up a building, (i.e. my
name's McVeigh (sp?), and this rider truck came from Oregon ;)... see my
point?

I do think that some information could be allowed (what your tag says,
your name, your mailing address), but what was put on he net was excesive.
