They _could_ refuse to give export permission for new RC4/40 versions,
and threaten prosecution if it's placed on the Internet.
It would be highly bogus, of course, but that's one of the "benefits"
of using selective enforcement and having the export strength limitations
be an individual-case-basis rather than a defined law they can be held to.
