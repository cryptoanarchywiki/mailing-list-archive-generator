They said that every other time their comrades had come to defcon, they had
tried to come incognito, and got caught every time.  This time, they wore
FBI t-shirts, and the only response was "Hey! Where'd ya get the T-Shirt?!?".
They said "We hacked 'em from the FBI" and that was it, noone suspected... =)
