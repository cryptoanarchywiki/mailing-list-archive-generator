The real issue concerns the $0.03 per minute access fee that LD companies
pay the local loop for voice communications. Seems there is difference
between data bits and voice bits. VON has sparked this debate and the ISP's
may end up paying the RBOCs the access fee.

The way around that as well is through point to point wiring (and of course
wireless systems). PairGain Technology is manufacturing a product that
provides 384Kbps data and voice over a single pair of copper. Many RBOCs
will sell you a LAD circuit which is point-to-point, unloaded, and
unswitched. They go by different names : telegraph circuits, alarm circuits,
Local Area Data Circuit. Ask a security company what kind of circuit they
install. Your mileage may vary.
