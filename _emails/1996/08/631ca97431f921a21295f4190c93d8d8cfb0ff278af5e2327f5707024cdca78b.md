No ulterior motives, Jim. Cool Down :)
Now lets see, you say we have enough capacity out there, alright, but then
why is everyone raving about "a slow internet". We all know in IT 640K
is never enough, niether is 640Mb. At some point in time, new cables
_have_ to be laid. Moreover you seem to be considering a static growth rate,
but we all know the Internet is nothing short of a big-bang. 

I am trying to debate a model rather than numbers and in which case its
important to to consider a long-term scenario.

This reminds me of a survey on a "proposed Rural Telecom Network" back in 
India, which finally decided that ROI will not justify the project
even in 20 years time.

Alright, once again I try to show what exactly I am pointing at. Alice uses
the phone 23 hrs a day, Bob uses 10 mins, both get their connections
from ABCTel. The bandwidth with ABCTel saturates and it has to buy more 
bandwidth (if ABCTel is a babybel, it will be buying it from a BigBell,
and whether or not bandwidth exists is quite besides the point here)
Its because of subscribers like Alice ABCTel is buying more bandwidth,
and the flat rate revenues generated by addition of a couple of members won't 
justify the new bandwidth. 

Flat rates are based on the assumption that a subscriber will use the service
for X amount of time. Since the phoneco has no control over user behaviour,
more that reasonable number of Alice-type clients will screw up the phonecos 
economics.

With explosion of Internet, people have found a new way of using their phone
line, and all these companies are already in trouble. To top all that we
are loudly professing the Internet (ultra-low-cost) solutions to LD Calls
with phoneco.
