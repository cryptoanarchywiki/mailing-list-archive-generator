Exactly, 'surface resemblance'. The Constitution at no point mentions
businesses in respect to the rights of the individual which is where all
discussions must start from in this government.

For example, some folks have claimed that corporations have rights that
prevent warantless searches and such. I have to strongly disagree. I see no
rational way to extend this to a corporation. If the police must use a
warrant to search a business located other than in a persons home or on
their property it is because the people who are present on that premisis
have rights and those rights would be infringed by such searches. I am not
even shure I accept the legal premise of corporations.

The amendment say:
 
	The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, 
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall 
not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, 
supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place 
to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
