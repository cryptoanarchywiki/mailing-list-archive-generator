Actually I believe that without "junk mail" costs for regular postage would
probably be higher: less mail = fewer packages over which to amortize the
cost of building the infrastructure necessary for ubiquitous messaging.
Direct-mail organizations get a lower rate by doing a lot of the expensive
parts of post office work themselves (pre-sorting the mail by zip code,
barcoding messages, etc) and not necessrily just based upon volume.  For all
the bitching Americans do about the high cost of first-class mail it is still
the least expensive of any western  nation and offers fairly good service
(and the USPS actually made a profit for the last two years so it is unlikely
that the cost will go up for a while...)
