One large change, which has been discussed previously on the list, is that
management is becoming more and more a function of specifying WHAT is to
be done, rather than HOW it is to be done.  This leads to a business model
based more on the independent contractor (whether it's a single individual,
or a business that does 'outsourcing' work) than the traditional industrial
assembly line.

Add ubiquitous high-speed data communications networks, and suddenly
national governments become not only irrelevant, but actual impediments
to a free market economy.  Potholes, if you will, on the information
superhighway (attribution to T. May).  

The structural changes are many.  Worldwide regulatory and tax arbitrage.
Elimination of the entire job category of 'middle management'.  Capital
in the form of knowledge and reputation rather than fixed physical assets.
Intentionally temporary organizational structures.  Individual responsibility
for what used to be called 'benefits'.

I'm a networking consultant.  My father had three jobs in his entire
lifetime.  I had three jobs this morning.  If that's not structural change,
I don't know what is.
