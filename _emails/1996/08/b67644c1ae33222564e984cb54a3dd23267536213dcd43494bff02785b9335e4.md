>>>>>>
>>>>>>>Two things highly significant:  1)  Weeks ago, a reliable source
>>>>>>>advised me
>>>>>>>that the investigators were not worried about explosive residue fading in
>>>>>>>salt water because they had other evidence.  Components of a missile,
>>>>>>>perhaps?  Couldn't say.
>>>>>>
>>>>>>>2)  Same source told me the other day that the investigators were now
>>>>>>>conducting "metalurgical studies",  i.e., they were looking for and
>>>>>>>analzying certain types of metal.  Tungsten, perhaps?  Bombs don't
>>>>>>>contain
>>>>>>>tungsten but SAM warheads are often surrounded by tungsten balls or
>>>>>>>pellets.
>>>>>>>They help cut the metal skin of their target aircraft.
>>>>>>
>>>>>>>OTHER NOTES:
>>>>>>
>>>>>>>1) Rocket motor of a missile would be capable of touching off a fire in
>>>>>>>nearby fuel tanks.   An Exocet missile sank the destroyer SHEFFIELD
>>>>>>>in the
>>>>>>>Falklands War without the warhead even detonating.  The missile cut
>>>>>>>through
>>>>>>>the hull, severed fuel lines and the rocket motor touched off the spilled
>>>>>>>fuel, causing a fatal fire.
>>>>>>
>>>>>>>2)  Something ejected the air conditiioning plant in the first
>>>>>>>debris field.
>>>>>>>What would blow out the missing bottom of the aircraft center without
>>>>>>>collapsing the internal structures, then manage to blow the forward
>>>>>>>fuselage
>>>>>>>off, rip away the right side of the fuselage and cause burn marks
>>>>>>>there and
>>>>>>>in the adjacent wing?  A titanic explosion which quickly ripped the
>>>>>>>fuselage
>>>>>>>apart faster than Pan Am 103 went.
>>>>>>
>>>>>>>3)  The sound on the cockpit voice recorder is different from any
>>>>>>>other they
>>>>>>>have heard before on two other 747s downed by bombs (Pan Am and Air
>>>>>>>India).
>>>>>>>Perhaps the sound was not caused by a bomb?  It seems we have only a
>>>>>>>bomb or
>>>>>>>a missile left at this point.  If it's not a bomb, then....?
>>>>>>
>>>>>>>4)  Nose gear damaged in its hold.  Nose gear door gone.  Right side
>>>>>>>forward
>>>>>>>cargo hatch blown off in first field.  The doors and AC unit located
>>>>>>>together.  How does a bomb inside the center fuselage do such damage
>>>>>>>to the
>>>>>>>nose gear area?  It doesn't seem possible.  However, an external
>>>>>>>blast and
>>>>>>>shock wave would be consistent with this, especially if it initiated
>>>>>>>at the
>>>>>>>left rear and traveled forward, rippling along the bottom of the
>>>>>>>aircraft.
>>>>>>>It would be very interesting to note if the nose gear door found in
>>>>>>>Area #3
>>>>>>>(the "first" debris field, that closest to JFK) happens to have been from
>>>>>>>the right side.
>>>>>>
>>>>>>>5)  Latest pieces of wreckage with fuselage stringers and stiffeners
>>>>>>>AGAIN
>>>>>>>show at least subtle evidence of an external explosion rippling the outer
>>>>>>>fuselage inward.  Look at the video of all outer hull sections recovered.
>>>>>>>The outer skin is pushed inward around the  stringers.  If it had been an
>>>>>>>internal bomb, the metal would be almost universally bowed OUTWARD
>>>>>>>away from
>>>>>>>the stringers and ribs.  But they aren't.  In virually every case I have
>>>>>>>seen so far, the sheet metal is not pulled AWAY from the stringers.  They
>>>>>>>may be popped loose but even in those rare cases, the indentations on the
>>>>>>>outer skin make it appear as though the stringers have been pushed inward
>>>>>>>away from the outer sheet metal, not as though the steet metal had been
>>>>>>>pused outward away from the stringers.
>>>>>>
>>>>>>>6)  If a bomb, why so little PETN?  Why isn't it virtually
>>>>>>>everywhere?  Pan
>>>>>>>AM 103 HAD lots of it even though the bomb went off contained in a cargo
>>>>>>>bin.  What would account for so little PETN in this case?
>>>>>>
>>>>>>>A proximity fuze detonation of a missile would touch off the blast
>>>>>>>outside
>>>>>>>the aircraft.  Kinetic energy would still send a large portion of it into
>>>>>>>the aircraft, penetrating it and passing through, but most of the
>>>>>>>explosive
>>>>>>>residue would burn away or dissipate outside of the aircraft.  If
>>>>>>>they can
>>>>>>>find fragments of the 747 underbelly and subject them to tests, I
>>>>>>>strongly
>>>>>>>believe they will find higher concentrations of both PETN residue and
>>>>>>>tungsten fragments embedded in the metal.
>>>>>>
>>>>>>>If this was a bomb, it had to be enormously powerful, skillfully
>>>>>>>planted or
>>>>>>>just unfortunately "lucky."  The entire bottom of the plane around the
>>>>>>>center wing box is said to be missing but, bewteen the passenger
>>>>>>>cabin and
>>>>>>>the outer surface of the bottom of the plane is some of the most robust
>>>>>>>construction known to exist on the 747.  How is it, then,  that that the
>>>>>>>"device" was able to blow off the front of the fuselage, blow away
>>>>>>>at least
>>>>>>>the right side of the fuselage, then make it past the heavy-duty
>>>>>>>wings and
>>>>>>>AC unit to shread the bottom of the plane into fragments so small
>>>>>>>they may
>>>>>>>have to dredge to recover them?
>>>>>>
>>>>>>>It seems that only a missile could rip away the bottom exterior upon
>>>>>>>contact
>>>>>>>to blast away the AC unit lying right above that area.  As the hot
>>>>>>>remains
>>>>>>>of the missile body continue into the aircraft, they could tear open the
>>>>>>>center fuel tanks and, with the compression of air and kinetic
>>>>>>>energy, blow
>>>>>>>out the right side and cause separation of the forward fuselage.  The
>>>>>>>thousands of tungsten fragments and the armor-piercing capability of
