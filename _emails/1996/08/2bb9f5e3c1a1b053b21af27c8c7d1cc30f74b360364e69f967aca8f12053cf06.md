	Does www.anonymizer.com filter out cookies and their requests? I'd also
be curious if an alternate means of specifying the url (without having to
manually type it in) is possible such that people would have problems doing a
search for all pages connecting to a page. I.e., currently, I can search for
pages connecting to a particular page through the anonymizer via doing an
AltaVista search for link:/page/in/which/i'm/interested.html. If the person had
to realize that, say, they had to do a search for
page__in__which__i'm__interested.html, that could make unfriendly tracing of
backlinks - sensitive backlinks if you're using the anonymizer - more difficult.

P.S. The problem with blank pages from the anonymizer seems to be fixed, or at
least I haven't run into it recently - thanks.
