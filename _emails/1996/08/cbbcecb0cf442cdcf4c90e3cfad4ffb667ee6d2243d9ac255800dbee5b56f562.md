This technique has been used a lot.  But bear in mind that the goal
of the whole operation was to perfect their knowledge of the
technology of rockets.  Launching from a balloon born platform is
not a triviality.  Ground launch enables much more control in the
super critical phase called "countdown and launch", where a lot of
the failures occurs.  When they will have mastered theses phases, 
then, the'll start thinking about an airborne launch platform.

If you want to learn about it, there is a rocketry group on Usenet.
>From there, you can ask directions for various sites, mainly outside
of north america, where they experiment with homebuilt liquid-liquid,
liquid-solid and other engines.  There is also quite a large movement
in USA, but I did not find (a year ago), sites that were as
experimental as the europeans (Belgians?) ones.   It seems that the 
US sites are more talking about using some commercially built motors, 
mainly using liquid-solid technology.

Have fun
