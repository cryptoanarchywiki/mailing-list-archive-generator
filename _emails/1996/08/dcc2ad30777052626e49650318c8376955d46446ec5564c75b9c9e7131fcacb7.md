With all the talk of self-enforcing contracts via cryptography, it is a
bit surprising to me that no one has suggested a constitution (which is
basically a unilateral contract) be enforced in such a matter, or in an
indirect way through technology.

I do find it sad that it seems that rights today must be enforced despite,
and not by, trust.

Perhaps soon there will exist institutions which make rights inalienable
in fact, not in theory.
