My first guess is that you were taking LSD back then but then I wasn't
there. The second guess would be because you didn't read very carefuly. I
said nothing about highest-ethics or any other such promises of behaviour or
action. I think you are reading more into my statement than is there. I
simply said that some of my generation plan on using the rules against the
establishment.

I consider that a subtle but important difference.
