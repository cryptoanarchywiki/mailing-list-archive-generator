I connected to my site running Stronghold 1.3b1.  Only got 40 bit
encryption.  I then connected to Netscape's Store site.  Only got 40 bit
encryption.  I checked the info box (or about box, I don't remember which)
for the connection and it claimed to be running the "exportable" version.
(The Win95 version connects properly to both sites with no tweaking needed.)

I will double check, but neither site would connect with 128 bits straight
out of the tar file.
