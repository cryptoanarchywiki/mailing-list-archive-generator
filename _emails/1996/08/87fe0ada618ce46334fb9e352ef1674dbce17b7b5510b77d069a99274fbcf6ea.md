Let's take a look at the successful havens of history.

1.  Hashishim( Old man of the mountains)-The Aga Khan survived thousands of
years of harassment by the surrounding powers by placing a few well choosen
daggers.
2. The monastic system- These whole setup was an excellent model.  The
monks were burrowed away in those places for centuries.  The church built
them like fortresses to withstand the heathens, both mentally and
physically.  The original "data warehouse".
3. The pirate havens- Places like the carribbean(originally), then
Madagasgar(last).  Pirate havens did business for everyone.
4. The silk routes- The trading centers of the old silk road sprang up
overnight then vanished.  Original anonymous trade.
  All of these physical havens eventually fell to the persistance of the
major powers of the day. Or were co-opted by others who absorbed the
critical black market features of these systems.
