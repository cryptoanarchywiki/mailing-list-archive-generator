The long distance companies are not "using local networks," your customers 
are...to connect to those long distance companies.  And any payments LD 
companies make to you are, indeed, a subsidy.   Tell me, how much is this 
_subsidy_, exactly?

BTW, in case you doubt this assessment, let's do a fair comparison, shall 
we?  Let's suppose, for the moment, that the amount of the subsidy is 3 
cents per minute.  (a figure I heard around here, recently.)  As an 
alternative, the phone company would presumably be entitled to be served by 
phone lines, at say $30 per month or so, through which their customers reach 
them.  $30 per month is $1 per day or 4 cents per hour or about 0.07 cents 
per minute.   3 cents doesn't equal 0.07 cents, now does it?!?

Tell me again how "the local/long distance subsidy was eliminated at 
breakup."  Tell me another one, daddy...

How has this remaining SUBSIDY dropped over time, assuming it has?  When is 
it scheduled to drop to zero?

First, you need to figure out how to supply ISDN for a REASONABLE charge, 
like "no extra charge!" to customers.  It's been over 16 years after I first 
heard of ISDN.  At the time, it seemed like a wonderful idea...against the 
300 baud modems then in use.  Against modern 31K modems that you only have 
to pay for...ONCE...ISDN seems mighty lame.

Face it, ISDN used to be a good idea.  But it's just barely shown up the 
moment it's hit the end of its marketing window.  ISDN will have a marketing 
lifetime for maybe a couple of more years, and only then because you can't 
put more bits through a 3.4 khz passband.

Not to mention all the bullshit propaganda that claimed that with ISDN, you 
wouldn't have to buy any modems.  Well, maybe that's just because they 
didn't CALL them modems, but they charged way more for an essentially 
indistinguishable function.  Can you say, "Fraud"?  I knew you could!

Okay, go ahead, charge a little extra for ISDN.  How much more?  Well, let's 
see:  31K modems sell for $99.  ISDN is four times faster, so let's say it's 
worth four times more, or $400.  Amortized over 10 years, that's about $3.60 
per month.

Fair enough?
