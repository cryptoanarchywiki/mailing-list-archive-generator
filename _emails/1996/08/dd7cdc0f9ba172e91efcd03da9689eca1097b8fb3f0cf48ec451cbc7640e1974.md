Not quite sure what this has to do with crypto, but here goes:

As with the recent federal legislation denying soc sec benefits to LEGAL
aliens who are required by law to pay into the system and can by law be
required to serve in the US armed forces, this appears to my untrained eye
to be yet another case of isolationist paranoia...I am sure this one
violates international agreements that the US has made concerning reciprocal
accodomations as far as driving is concerned.

I used to be a tax-paying soc sec paying legal alien, but I got so fed up
with head-in-the-dirt hicks who thought you had to be a citizen to breathe
the prairie dust that I became a citizen for an easier life (and I mean some
of these ignorant fools were sons of immigrants who voted agianst the US
fighting Hitler!!!!). 

Because I still talk with something of a foreign accent I still get
uneducated idiots, who couldn't pass the test they make foreigners take,
lecturing me on what I cannot do because I am a foreigner. The only thing I
can't do is run for President. 

I despair of backwater state legislators, I really do. What to do about this
particular problem? Check out the rules on International drivers licenses. I
know can drive on them for a year...If you are not allowed a drivers license
because you are an alien, maybe you don't need their stinking licenses.
