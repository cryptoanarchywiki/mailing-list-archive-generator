	Wouldn't you have to use military-grade chips for the hardware? (Or
whatever the type is - it had better survive launch, not to mention solar
flares.)

	Well, there would be less need to make it hurricane proof! :-)

	Wow - I've been out of touch with space programmes in the last few
years - which satellite was this? (The HAM radio one?)

	Anyone have any reccomendations for good web sites on
satellites/rockets/space science in general?

	Here's a couple of ESA URLs to start the ball rolling:
ARIANE 5 Failure - Full Report
European Space Agency


	I'm not sure who would launch it - a Japanese launcher? (ESA is
strapped for cash, which was one reason for the phenomenaly stupid move of
putting space probes onto the maiden flight of the Ariane 5.)

	Derek
