   8-26-96, NYP: 
 
   "A Netscape Bid For the Souls of New Machines." Markoff. 
 
      Netscape plans on Monday to announce that it has created 
      a software company that will enter an alliance with 
      I.B.M., Oracle and four Japanese consumer electronics 
      giants. The venture, called the Navio Corporation, 
      intends to develop refined software for browsing the 
      Internet and a new OS that Netscape hopes will become a 
      standard means for controlling Internet access and basic 
      operations for a broad range of consumer devices. 
 
      The four Japanese companies in the alliance -- Sony, 
      Nintendo, Sega and NEC -- are dominant in producing a 
      variety of home entertainment devices, and the expected 
      announcement, analysts said, suggested that the 
      Internet, which until now has largely been a business 
      and educational marketplace, would soon vastly broaden 
      its scope.
