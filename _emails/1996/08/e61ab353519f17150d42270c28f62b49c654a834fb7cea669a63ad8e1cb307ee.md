   Am I missing something here because isn't the easiest way around all of this is simply not to enter your personal info when setting up Netscape?  Granted the page can pick up your ISP and what port you used, but so what?  It can't get your name and email address.  Use a newsreader such as Free Agent so there's no reason to enter your personal info.  If there is a reason to respond to someone who's email is in on a particular page, then copy it and paste to your emailer...
