Au contraire:

 Let me have men about me that are fat;
 Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:
 Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
 He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
[...]
        He reads much;
 He is a great observer, and he looks
 Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
 As thou dost, Antony: he hears no music:
 Seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort
 As if he mock'd himself, and scorn'd his spirit
 That could be mov'd to smile at anything.

Which member of the Dream Team does this remind you of?

All I know is:

1. At least one person is dead, and lots more injured.
2. For nothing.

Ferchrissakes, guys, take a step back and look at yourselves. You're playing
the spin control game just as fast and furious as the "bad guys" (?). First
the glee over how easy it was to find bomb-making instructions anywhere,
then saying it was a provocation by the government, now it becomes a
conspiracy against fat people who read gun magazines.
