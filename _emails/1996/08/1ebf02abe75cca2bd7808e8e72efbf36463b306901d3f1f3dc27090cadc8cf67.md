I'm listening to the BBC's World Service at the moment, and they're doing a
feature on pedophiles on the internet, complete with much knashing of teeth
about encryption and anonymity, along with some lurid stuff about private
holding cells, and sexual tourism, and slavery. And Lions. And Tigers. And
Bears. Oh My.

They even had a quote from someone at Wired (a Brit, didn't catch the
name), who sounded like he was wringing his hands about unbreakable
encryption. Probably spliced out of a larger quote which had more sense in
it.

Be afraid, be very afraid. They're coming for your daughters. The BBC says so.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
