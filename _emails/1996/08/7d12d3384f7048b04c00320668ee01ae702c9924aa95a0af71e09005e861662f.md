Hi all,

I work with Hi Performance and Experimental rockets and I am somewhat
familiar with explosives and the handling thereof. I have a couple of
comments to add to the pipe bomb building thread...

Do this and you will get a reaction which can cause a spontaneous explosion.
In short keep all greases and other such products away from explosives. If
you must use threads on a pipe in such a situation make VERY shure they are
clean and dry. I would use water to first wash the water solubles away and
then would use alcholol to clean the threads of the remaining debree.
Also, always use a cotten rag otherwise you run the risk of building up a
static charge sufficient to set it off.

If you must use metal tools in the constructio of your bomb make shure of
two things. First, there is another person to call the ambulance. Also be
shure to use a non-sparking tool (read that as expensive) do NOT use steel
or iron tools. You would just be asking to blow yourself up from sparks.
Most tool catalogs will have a small section of Beryllium based tools or
something similar.
