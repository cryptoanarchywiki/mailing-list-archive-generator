Apparently Jim does not understand that the "race for profit 
margin" is what LOWERS the prices of goods and services.  You 
might check out HUMAN ACTION by von Mises.  Anyway, as I said in 
my previous post.

less violent they injecting the coercive state apparatus into a
volutary transactions between PEOPLE.

Made and enforced by PEOPLE.  Jim is begging the question.

Gee, I don't know your dog.  His understanding of economics
couldn't be much more rudimentary.  (Okay, it was a cheap
