This should be a good half-day conference, with some interesting 
speakers. I'll probably show up for Charles Platt's keynote.

Naturally, it's being held in the building's Hayek Auditorium. Hayek has 
some relevance to cypherpunks, I think -- he warned early on that the 
loss of economic freedom inevitably leads to the loss of civil liberties 
as well.

He also described the phenomenon of spontaneous order (admittedly in the 
context of markets), which speaks to the way the Net has ordered itself.

Regulation or Private Ordering?  The Future of the Internet

The Cato Institute cordially invites you to a morning conference and luncheon 

Regulation or Private Ordering?
The Future of the Internet

Friday, September 20, 1996
8:30 a.m.   1:30 p.m.

The Cato Institute's F.A. Hayek Auditorium 
1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W. 
Washington, DC

The Internet promises users unprecedented individual control over
information. It is at once a tool for universal communication, a new form of
media, and a new way of doing business. But it is also a challenge to
lawmakers and regulators. Existing laws cannot easily be applied to the
Internet and appear doomed to failure. Do we need a new set of laws or will
voluntary private action ensure order on the information superhighway?
 
Cato's Regulation or Private Ordering? The Future of the Internet conference
will bring together leading authorities on law, regulation, and technology
to discuss the problems of adapting existing law to the Internet and to
explore private alternatives to regulation. Can private ordering consistent
with individual   
freedom forestall a government backlash against perceived Internet chaos?

The cost of this conference is $25.00.
