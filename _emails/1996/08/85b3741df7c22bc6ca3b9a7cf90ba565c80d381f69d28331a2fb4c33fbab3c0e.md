It seems rather obvious now, but since I learned the hard way, I figured
that I'd save the rest of you from a painful experience.

I have one HD of 1.2gb.  I created a 50mb partition at the end of the drive
using PM and encrypted it with SD14b.  I ran out of room on the secured
partition and wanted to enlarge it.  I used PM to shrink the primary
partition a little, and to enlarge the secured partition.  When I shrank the
primary, the free space on the drive appeared between the two partitions.
To enlarge the secondary, I moved it to the free space, then enlarged it on
the right.  This was BAD!  PM did its thing, but no matter what I did after
that, I couldn't get the secured partition to a usable state.  I ended up
formatting the secured partition to recover.  

After some playing, it seems that PM tries to "re-align" the data on the 2nd
partition when you move left.  That's where things get screwed up.  I tested
a few combinations, and found that everything works fine if you decrypt the
partition before moving/resizing, then re-encrypt after.

Just some friendly info.
