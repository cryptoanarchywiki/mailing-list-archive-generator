They already have cameras on Tri-Met busses in Portland Oregon.  (Not all of
them, yet...  But many of them have two cameras.  One at the front and one
at the middle.)

It occured during one of the media inspired panics about people with guns on
busses.

Remember: A Paranoid constabulary is an effiecient constabulary.  (Just
because you got caught in the crossfire of a cop shooting at a suspected jay
walker does not make it any less effiecient.)

Support your local police for a more efficient police state!
