Public keys and private keys:

Private key only you know,  Public key everybody knows.

You use private key to sign, you use the other guys 
public key to encrypt, so that no one but him can read
the message, not even you, unless you kept the original
copy.

Public key does not decrypt.

Other guy uses his private key to decrypt the message you sent
him.

What one man knows, nobody knows, what two men know, everyone
knows.  If you had to share keys in order to communicate, the
keys would not stay secret very long.

Public key encrypts and verifies signature.  Private key encrypts
and signs.
