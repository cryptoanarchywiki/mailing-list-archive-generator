I use Pronto Mail also. I just started using it yesterday. I can honestly 
say that it makes things simpler... no cutting, pasting, decrypting, 
encrypting...and on and on. It is the sweetest mailer since Ishmail ( UNIX 
/ Linux ). Not even Ishmail did key management and fetching, sending, 
etc....

I will be able to use Pronto in my effort to proselytize the cause. The 
only thing I see that will prevent a lot of folks from getting it ( and 
paying for it ) is the price. $300 US seems a bit steep to some. I am going 
to pay for it because of the time it saves me. I would like to see a few 
things added, though. Multiple address books, keyed and non-keyed ( this 
might speed up the address book or add a search ( I have several hundred 
members of my firm listed in my Eudora mailer ). I'd also like to see some 
sort of IMAP address book support ( like Simeon or Z Mail ), These would 
also be accessable seperately in the interest of spped, since the pubring 
would be on each users machine.

With the C2 option in the NT Resource kit, I'd like an explanation on using 
Pronto with NT 4. I tried all sorts of things and had no luck after 
installing.. Pronto kept telling me the pifs were no good, couldn't find 
keys, etc...

None the less, I love it so far.. Just have to get the MC down a bit to pay 
for it (<GRIN> That;s why it's a 60 day demo )
