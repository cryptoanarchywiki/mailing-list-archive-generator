Hey - we just got back from a trip, it's good to see all your guys back
online.

I think one way to fightt junk e-mail is to do what I proposed: have a
"don't-e-mail" list available for FTP, and make it trivial to add one's
address to it. I can talk more about how I envision this if anyone is
willing to consider putting such a thing up.

I honestly don't think lightening&co want to e-mail people who don't
want to be e-mailed.
