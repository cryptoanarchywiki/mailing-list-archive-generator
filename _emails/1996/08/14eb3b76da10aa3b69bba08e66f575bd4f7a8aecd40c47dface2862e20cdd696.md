Bob,

If you have not already done so, please submit a public comment re: the
proposed Reg E changes [Docket No. R-0919]. The deadline is September 7th.
You may want to announce this to other fans of bearer certs. 

Thanks to my friends at the Fed, I am in possession of comments already
submitted. The opposition is trying to get the Fed to not make the proposed
account/non-account based distinction when deciding what is covered under
Reg E, but instead use a $ cap. The logic is that there is an account
anyway, be it on the card (such as the record of the total on a prepaid card
that is used for paying subway fares) or be it at the bank.

We need to make sure that the supporters of non-book entry systems make
their voices heard.

When writing the comment, please include a request to do away with the hard
copy signature requirements for opening accounts. If the Fed gets enough
requests, they will include it in the next round of proposals.
