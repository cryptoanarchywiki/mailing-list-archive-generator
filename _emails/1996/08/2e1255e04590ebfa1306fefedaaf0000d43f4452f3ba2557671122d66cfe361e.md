Hmmmm.....

Intresting but..., In the era of ITAR, GAK, Key Escrows,Clipper,& FileGate do we really want to put all our eggs in one basket? And that basket being based on hardware? IMHO I don't see Intell standing up to the government any more than Netscape, Mircosoft, IBM, or Lotus has. I have serious doubts that our "beloved" goverment will alow any standard to be adopted that does not allow them access whenever they please. I personally do not run any security code on my machines that I do not have the
source for & have instpected.


No source=No trust.

Including NSA, CIA, SS, FBI, Justice Department, .... I am more concern of the activities of our own government against its own citicens than any foreign government. Who is watching the watchers and what is YOUR execuse?
