-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The first alpha release of the WinSock Remailer is now available via
e-mail.  Due to problems setting up user authentication on my homepage
at

  http://www.c2.net/~winsock/

I have decided to distribute it via e-mail until I can get user 
authentication working.

In order for you to receive the WinSock Remailer, I have to be reasonably 
sure that you are a US or Canadian citizen or permanent resident.  
Therefore, you will need to review a copy of the License Agreement and 
fill out the required information.  Then clear-sign the agreement with PGP 
and mail it to me at jgrasty@gate.net.  Don't forget to tell me where I can
find your PGP public key so that I can check the signature.  No signed
license agreement, no remailer.

In order for me to have a good feeling that you are not a foreign national,
I need to have the following information check out:

a.  Verify that your address is within the boundaries of the US or Canada.
    I will do this by checking if you are in a public address database such
    as "88 Million Households Phone Book".
b.  Verify that your name and e-mail address is the same as in your public 
    key.

This is basically the same method that Netscape is using at:

  http://wwwus.netscape.com/eng/US-Current/

to verify citizenship or permanent residency, but the process is not
automated.

I don't like having to enforce clearly unconstitutional ITAR regulations,
but I'm not ready for an extended stay at Club Fed.

disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk
Activities.

Clear-sign this agreement with your PGP public key and e-mail it to 
jgrasty@gate.net.
