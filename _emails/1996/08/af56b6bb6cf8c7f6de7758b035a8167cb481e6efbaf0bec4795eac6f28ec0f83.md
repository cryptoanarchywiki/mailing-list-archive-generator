Reuters, 8/1/96:

FBI Director Louis Freeh warned Congress on
Thursday that the United States was under attack from foreign terrorists and
said new counter-terrorism weapons were needed to fight back.

...

On the Atlanta bomb that caused two deaths and wounded 111 people, he said
the FBI had no evidence "of an international terrorist group or a 
sophisticated group targeting the Olympics in general with respect to 
that incident."

But he said the United States was clearly vulnerable to possible future
terrorist attacks involving nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. He said 
he had recently met Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Charles Krulak to discuss a
possible joint FBI-Marine study on ways of countering weapons of mass
destruction.
