	Mixed messages, definitely. For one thing, people appear not to be
realizing that even with terrorism, trains and airplanes are still safer per
passenger mile than automobile. Driving people to drive more (no pun intended)
isn't going to save any lives. Besides which, if I've got an emergency flight
to catch, I may be willing to take the risk. Is there some reason that all
flights must be held to the same security, so long as everyone getting on
knows what level of security that is? Moreover, the suggestion of greater
humint bears with it infiltration (and possible agent procacateurship of)
any group that the government doesn't like.
