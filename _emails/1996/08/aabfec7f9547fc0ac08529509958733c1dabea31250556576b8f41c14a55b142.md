I explained a good deal of this in a post I made some time ago where I
related the tale of a friend who had simply made up a number and used it
since age 17.

The reality is that not much will be done, aside some form letters from
the IRS indicating that you seem to be using the wrong number, and won't
you please change it. 

I suppose that you might have to give it to the IRS if you want a refund,
but why to your employer?  Why not give your employer the wrong number
and correct it directly to the IRS when the IRS complains?

Ditto for your bank.

Almost no one can actually get the number related to your name, only
verify if the number you are using has been issued.

I am continually amazed at the number of people who surrender this number
simply because someone tells them that they have to or the sky will fall
in.

Bottom line, if someone besides the IRS or the SS people have your
name/number relation, it is because YOU gave it to them.
