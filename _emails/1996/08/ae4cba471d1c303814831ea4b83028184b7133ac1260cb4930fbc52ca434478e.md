They are also Anarchists.  (They are referenced on various Anarchist web
pages, among other places.)

My personal belief is that they are being prosecuted because they bill
themselves as Anarchists and not for what they are doing.  If this has been
"Society Wives Against Hunger", there would have been no problems at all.
(And probibly commendations from the local paper and civic leaders.)

Locally, people who have billed themselves as Anarchists have been monitored
by the police, harased, and arrested.  (Remember: you only deserve the
protection of the state if you do not oppose the state.)

It seems that this country is quite willing to harrass fringe political
groups when the "powers that be" feel they can get away with it.  (Which is
quite often.)
