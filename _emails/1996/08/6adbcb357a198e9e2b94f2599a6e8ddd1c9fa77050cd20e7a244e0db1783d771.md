Gladly. Prices rise over time because of inflation of the money 
supply.  While it is possible for private actors to temporarily
inflate the money supply (e.g., extension of credit by banks),
only the government can increase the money supply indefinitely.  
Inflation is the most insidious form of "taxation."  It steals
silently and punishes the savings in favor of consumption.

Technically, Jim's logical fallacy is called /post hoc, ergo 
propter hoc/, after this, therefore on account of this.

Nope, that's not what I said.  This fallacy is called a "straw
man."  It is a weak or mistated opposing argument set up by a 
politician or debator, etc., in order that he may attack it and
gain an easy, showy victory.

Since you have mistated my position, the balance of your argument
is irrelevant.  (But thanks for playing.)

Nope.  Whatever gave you that idea?

Nope.  You just don't get it, do you?

More straw men.  From what orfice was that proposition pulled?

Could these be the source of Jim's legal and economic knowledge?
You be the judge.
