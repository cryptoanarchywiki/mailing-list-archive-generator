There's still draft registration.  Sure, they don't currently ask that
your body show up at Camp LeJeune for basic training, but they still
insist that you register where you live and essentially give them
permission to draft you if they feel like taking the political heat 
for doing so.  It's illegal not to register if you're 18 and male.
And they do occasionally track whether people are registered;
college loan databases are used for it, and there are occasional
mentions in the press that they've used other sources of
lists-of-18-year-olds to "remind" people that they have to register,
such as public school records.

Some day that you're not too disgruntled, walk into a Post Office
and look at the posters oon the wall.
