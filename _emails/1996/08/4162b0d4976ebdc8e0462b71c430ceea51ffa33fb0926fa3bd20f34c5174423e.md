I certainly agree with Greg here, and find it too bad that his views do not
actually express the views of the Federal Reserve. (Actually, they may, as
I remember reading Alan Greenspan's stuff in Rand's books in the late 60s,
e.g., "Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.")

Not only is there inflation to consider, there is the double taxation I
should've emphasized more than I did.

Wages are typically corrected for inflation (for competitiveness reasons),
but capital gains are not. That stock I bought for $20 in 1975 dollars and
am now selling for $40 in 1996 dollars, and paying 40% in taxes on the
"gain," is clearly not really a doubling.
