Since we don't know how the intruders broke in, we can only speculate.  I
can think of several scenarios where cryptographic techniques could help.
I can also think of several where they wouldn't.  When you've only got 20
seconds to explain to a non-technical audience, I don't think it's dishonest
to say that it might have prevented it.

Off the top of my head, here are a couple examples:

   1. It's possible that a DOJ employee logged in from a remote site while
      the intruders were snooping somewhere along the way.  If the link had
      been encrypted, that would have made things much more difficult or
      impossible for the attackers.

   2. Perhpas the intruders used IP spoofing and .rhosts to break in.  If
      machines had to be cryptographically authenticated, a rsh from the
      wrong machine wouldn't work.

I think my 20 seconds are up.  :>
