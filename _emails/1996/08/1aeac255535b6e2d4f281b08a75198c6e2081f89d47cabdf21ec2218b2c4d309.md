Heard same thing here; it's almost certainly true.  It would help if the gun 
got a thorough cleaning as well:  You can "de-copper" a barrel by plugging 
one end, and filling the barrel with an ammonia solution. (this is available 
as a commercial product for guns, at wildly-inflated prices.  Ordinary 
ammonia solution works just as well, cheap.)   This dissolves the copper 
left from the passage of copper/brass-jacketed bullets.  You can tell it's 
working:  The copper forms the distinctive blue cupramine ion in solution.


BTW, all this changes is the microstructure of the markings:  The number of 
riflings and the twist of the riflings are, obviously, unchanged.
