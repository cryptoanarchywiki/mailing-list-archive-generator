On a more speculative note,  many years ago Harlan Ellison wrote an  
anti-statist short story entitled '"Repent Harlequin!" cried the Tick-Tock 

Man.' , in which the government required all adults to be surgically fitted
 
with 'cardioplates', which allowed the state to turn off the hearts of   
uncooperative citizen-units by radio.

NYP reports today on the thriving market for Radio Frequency Identification
(R.F.-ID) tags. 
 
 
And FiTi reports today on tagging cattle, tracking meat from cradle to
abbatoir, to ward off mad cow assassination politics. 
 
 
Are these precursors of CU body-tags acoming from ARPA labs? E-Systems and
a bunch of comp-conspirators just got supercalifrigalistic HPCC contracts.
