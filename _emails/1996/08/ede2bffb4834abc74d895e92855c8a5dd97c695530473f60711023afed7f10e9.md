I should have thought that fraud required use rather than manufacture.  It
is hard to defraud someone just by making something.  You have to
communicate with them in some way.  

The US has very broad fraud statutes and yet these passports are sold in the
US.  I've never heard of any action against them.  There is also a First
Amendment issue with the World Federalists and their "Citizen of the World"
passport.  

In any case, and ISP is not a publisher or vendor.

Sometimes people pay more attention to lawyers than they should.
