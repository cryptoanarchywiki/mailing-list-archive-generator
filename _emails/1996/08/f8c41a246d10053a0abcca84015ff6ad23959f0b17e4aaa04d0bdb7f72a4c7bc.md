The following weakness seems very obvious, I've got a partial writeup of this 
but before I turn it into a paper or something and arrange a demonstration of 
how it would work I thought I'd check to make sure (a) someone else hasn't 
mentioned it before, and (b) it is actually possible (it seems too simple to 
be true):
 
1. Using DNS spoofing, stage a hostile takeover of an address (for example 
   using bogus referrals set yourself up as the delegated server for a DNS 
   subtree).
2. Get a Verisign certificate for an arbitrary company and set up a bogus site 
   at the stolen address.
 
Lets say you steal www.megafoobarcorp.com.  People connect to this site (which 
is actually your bogus site), Netscape (for example) displays the blue line 
and non-broken key (which is actually for your J.Random certificate rather 
than the real megafoobarcorp one) to show the connection is secure, and you've 
just subverted their site.  
 
The problem is that unless the user on the client side checks their 
certificates (which noone does), all they're told is "A secure link is 
established", not who the secure link is established to.  Even if browsers did 
pop up a dialog to tell them who the secured connection was to, after about 
the third time people would click on the "Never show this incredibly annoying 
dialog again" option and never look at it again.     
 
This effectively reduces an attack on an SSL-enabled server to an attack on 
the DNS.  Is this as simple as it seems, and is it worth doing a writeup on?
 
Peter.
