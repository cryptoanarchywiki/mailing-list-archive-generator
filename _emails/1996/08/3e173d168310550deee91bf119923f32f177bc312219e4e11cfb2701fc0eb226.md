http://www.greatworld.com/ Used to have a whole pile of web accessable 
databases dealing with political corruption, crooked cops, government waste, 
and a database of alleged child molesters...  I beleive the site had to be 
shut down due to massive abuse, though.  The sponsor of the site was/is a 
guy named Tony Gatlin, his phone number was/is 615-859-3710. The company he 
worked for was/is called Self Test Software (selftestsoftware.com), but 
the company web page is defunct now as well. I'm guessing a massive libel suit
led to his untimely dissapearance from the net, but i could be wrong.. 

I'd say that he could probably contribute a paragraph or two on the 
problems facing people who try to engage in "whistle-blowing" on the net,
and could give a few good reasons why you aren't finding more services 
dealing with this sort of thing. Anonymity is great, if you really have 
something to say, but unfortunately for many people anonymity is nothing 
but a tool to injure others with impunity.
