The   letters page is editor@observer.co.uk . 

The thing  that really got me riled was the use of a quote from Tom Paine 
on the front page as the header to their leader. Tom Paine published most
of his important work anonymously, and thugs wouldoften try to beat up 
the publishers to find out who the author was. (Paine's friends sometimes 
did this too).
