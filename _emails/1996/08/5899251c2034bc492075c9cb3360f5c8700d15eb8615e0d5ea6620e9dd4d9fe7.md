I personally would find it useful if you could get a measure of
trustworthy ness due to keydistance. Like that if I knew that the sender
is only 2 keys away from my own I would most likely trust his public key
to be the original, it would be nice to see the signing people involved
though:
Max Miller 
  |-signed- a friend of mine <-signed- me
  |-signed- Molly Malone <-signed- Someone <-signed- friend <- signed me

According to http://bcn.boulder.co.us/~neal/pgpstat/ there were 19124 keys
in the keyserver but the biggest werb of trust had only 1291 keys and
the next only 16 keys. The mean key distance was between 6 and 7.
That means that you don't have to get too many public keys in order to
find the connection to your key and on the other hand it might show that
calculating trust according to keydistance isn't worth is since the web
of trusts are so small. But I figure if you would show the connection of
keys in your mailer it might encourage people to participate in key
signing parties.

How would you get the pass phrase if not via the keyboard ? And if you
keep it in memory till you sign off ( like in premail ) you would only
have to type it once, though capturing the pass phrase once is normaly
enough.

Though I think that Pronto Secure will help spread the use of cryptography
I would prefer a source code distributed library which could handle most
of the stuff needed including for example preparing encrypted requests to
key servers ( via anonymous remailers or not )( it keyservers will
implement encrypted requests ) or calculating the key distance if possible
with the available keys.

I guess one should wait for the arrival of the pgp 3.0 lib and evaluate
what it can and can't.
