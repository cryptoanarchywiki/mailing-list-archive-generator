Allow me to quote from your web page:

Quote #1:
"The POUCH is a secure e-mail terminal program for IBM compatible
computers. It uses a secret key phrase, advanced cryptographic
techniques and several unpublished algorithms to protect data in the
body of e-mail messages. The key phrase, which can be up to 48 bytes
long, is easily remembered and communicated. The POUCH is highly
resistant to all known forms of cryptographic attack."

Quote #2:
"We warrant that the product when delivered to you has no short cuts,
covert channels or secret solutions of any kind. No other warranty,
either expressed or implied is given."

These two statements are contradictory; an unpublished algorithm is
itself a secret solution, and a covert channel.

Why is it that software manufacturers keep popping up and spewing
nonsense? Obscurity is not security. Making the algorithm proprietary
does extremely little in making it resistant to attack. All of your
statements regarding the security of "The Pouch" are worthless, for
you have no data with which to substantiate your claims.

If it is any good, there's no way for us to know. But your marketing
of the product has every indication that it's nothing more than smoke
and mirrors. To coin a phrase, "pseudocrypto."

Please refrain from your bogus marketing techniques. This kind of
stuff, by claiming to be "real cryptography" makes real cryptographers
look bad.
