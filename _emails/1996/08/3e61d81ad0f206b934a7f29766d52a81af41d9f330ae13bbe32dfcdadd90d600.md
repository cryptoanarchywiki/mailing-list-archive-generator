I recently downloaded the crypto++ class library and am having a bit of
trouble getting things to happen.  I have read the text on the
source-filter-sink concept and was able to create a DES file encryptor.
What I would like to do is use either blowfish or IDEA to encrypt a variable
length data stream.  Does anybody have experience with this library?  A
short code snippet or similar help would be appreciated.
