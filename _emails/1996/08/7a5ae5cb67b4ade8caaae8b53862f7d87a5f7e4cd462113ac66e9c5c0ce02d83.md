Something for future hackers to think about adding in future attacks (*):


"Press HERE to access National Law Enforcement Master Key Database"

or

"Back Door"   (with some semi-realistic-looking computer files....)

or

"Click HERE to download confidential FBI dossiers on Clinton's political
enemies."

(with a few entries on leading Republicans and former White House
occupants, for verisimilitude)


In other words, the DOJ attack _could have_ made some much stronger points
than merely saying DOJ is linked to Hitler and pornography, etc.

(* I am not by these words _encouraging_ such hacks, at least not in any
active, conspiratorial, RICO sense.)

Illegal speech if said to Herr Clinton: "You suck, and those boys died!"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
