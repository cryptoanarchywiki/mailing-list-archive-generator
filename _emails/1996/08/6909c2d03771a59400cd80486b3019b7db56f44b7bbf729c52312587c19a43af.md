I thinks they have mixed their marbles....

The FAA is trialing (at the Olympics & Oshkosh) a GPS
rx/transponder; piped into a moving map.

The reason is their existing long-range radar (called ARSR --
Air Route surveillance Radar) is very long in the tooth, & they
have no hope of getting money to replace it. (Their recent 50
mile system procument, the ASR-9, looked like the worst of the
Sgt. York & the V-22...)

Note they spend $3-400E6 annually on radar maint. alone. [I
suspect they have to buy their vacuum tubes from St. Petersburgh,
the last source of them...]

The GPS scheme could replace:
	Primary Radar
	VOR [en route nav. -- lots of ground transmitters {?200?}
	scattered around country]
	ILS [instrument landing system]

It's the only rational thing I've seen the FAA pursue, vice be
forced into, in 20 years....
