What exactly was the reason for the refusal to process the form? At that
point the FNB folks should have started a suite against the city and not
gone to the park. If they did they should have been very careful about
advertising the HD's refusal and making it clear that their presence and
actions there were a form of political disobedience.

There are good ways to tweak a nose and there are bad ways. Sounds like
these folks chose a bad way to begin with. I am glad to hear that justice
won out in the end. I bet next time the HD just processes the form. Is the
person in charge of the HD elected or appointed? If appointed than start a
suite against them as well as the department.

Certainly.
