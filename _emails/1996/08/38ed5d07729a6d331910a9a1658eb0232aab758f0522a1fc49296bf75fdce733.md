   'electronic purses' using smart cards." 
 
      "We are moving into the electronic age where money will 
      just be information about the wealth you have," says 
      Visa. Some companies believe that parts of the body, 
      rather than paper or coins, can be used to establish the

   WaPo: "Group Plans Challenge To Net Address Monopoly." 
 
      The end may be at hand for the virtual monopoly that 
      Network Solutions holds over the registration of 
      Internet addresses. The Internet Assigned Numbers 
      Authority, the Internet Society and IETF will organize 
      a competition for the right to operate new registries. 
      The group's aim is to create alternatives to the 
      established categories of Internet addresses.
