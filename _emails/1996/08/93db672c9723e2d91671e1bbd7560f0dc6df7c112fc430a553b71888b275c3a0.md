Irrelevant. Unix boxes are multi-user.

Scenario 1: writing a multi-platform comm program with strong crypto, and
including a Mac port (like Mac PGP, or clients for various tcp/ip protocols)
is only a minor waste of time.

Scenario 2: writing an encrypted filesystem for the Mac is a minor waste.

Scenario 3: Writing a comm program that lets Macs talk to each other with
no consideration that some Mac users may wish to talk to other platform
(or any other Mac-only software) is a major waste of time.

Of course, Apple is pushing #3. They're worse than Microsoft.
