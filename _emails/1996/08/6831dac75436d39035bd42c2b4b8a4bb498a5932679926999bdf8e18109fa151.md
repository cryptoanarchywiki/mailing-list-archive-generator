	You have to register as a company with CA DMV.  Pay them an
	annual fee, and a per report pulled fee, and only pull 
	records for a _legitimate business need._  

	Addresses are only provided if a court case the target 
	of the search is listed as being involved in.  Docket #
	must be listed -- which gives rise to some interesting 
	problems.

	Depends upon the state.   In some states it is a misdemeanor
	to list anything other than your physical address.  Others
	don't care what you list, so long as mail can be delivered
	there.  

	More important is ensuring that all the addresses that the 
	state has on you are the same.  The preference seems to be 
	to have the same address as is on one's checks.  

	What I've noted some people do, is give their physical address,
	and provide a mail address as well.  Then the individuals move, 
	and omit to notify the state of the move.  When questioned about
	it, their usual response is something along the lines of "
	I get all of my mail at my mail box. I did not 
	realize that I had to file a change of address form, with you.
	After 
	all the address on my licence is the address where I get my
	mail.  [  In most states the mail address is the address listed
	when two addresses are provided. ] "
