I strongly agree.  You've also potentially annoyed a bunch of Europeans,
Unicode-speakers, and other users of non-ASCII alphabets.
Just because the domain name in somebody's address is case-insensitive 
(and culturally-insensitive :-) ASCII, that doesn't mean their user
name will be also, especially if their _real_ mail system is some
ugly proprietary thing like Microso-Cc:PR0FS-HS.400 or if their
name is Swedish or Chinese.

(X.400 may be evil, but it does exist :-)

! is still around, especially for gateways to proprietary mail systems.

You also need to add colon : and maybe comma , .
