The virus is activated when the GIF is _viewed_.

The viewing of the GIF activates the cerebro-visual processing centers of
the brain, activating the ancient Sumerian meme complex. I assume, of
course, you are referring to the deadly Snow Crash Good Times virus.

If infected, the only solution is to unsubscribe from the Cypherpunks list
before others are similarly infected.

Hey, Moroni, we've missed your particular slant these last few months.
