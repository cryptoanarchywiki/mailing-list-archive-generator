Thanks for the list of useful protocols to consider.  I'll wind up
getting the rest from Applied Cryptography and your Cyphernomicon if
I don't get any more input.

Some of these are fairly easy to fake, though.  Fair coin tosses, for
example:

Assume a perfectly trustworthy escrow agent.  (A bad assumption in
real life, but workable on a MUD, where it's the server.)
Tell the agent to wait until all parties have contributed a bit,
and then announce the XOR of the bits.  As long as an individual
has picked a bit randomly, and given it to the escrow agent securely,
the result is random.

That doesn't answer the questions of integration into a game, or how
make a crypto anarchy out of it.  I'll just have to try things and
see what works.

My code doesn't do nearly as much as you seem to think it does.
All of its "security" relies on a mutually trusted interpreter, which
isn't a bad assumption on a MUD.  I'm cheating on the cryptography,
but I think I can get away with it for the purposes of a game.

And, of course, I didn't comment it, document it, or integrate it into
the rest of the game.

Even if it's more than that much harder, it's still worth doing.  I'll
see how long it takes, but I'll try for robustness instead of coding
speed.

"True Names" is a better fit than SimCity for what I'm imagining.  In
the absence of any better ideas, it'll borrow a lot from LPmud too.

I've considered a game-run anonymous market, with bid and asked prices
akin to the stock market equivalents.  Characters would have the money
(or whatever) unavailable until the bid or ask was withdrawn, and clearing
would be automatic in case of a match.

It's more appealing if the market is magically provided by a wizard of
some reputation, but game-run is simpler to start with.
