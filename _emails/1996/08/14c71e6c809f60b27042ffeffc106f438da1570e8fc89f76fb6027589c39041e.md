I believe the issue with Food Not Bombs is they didn't get the appropriate
permits, etc, or were denied them, or something.  However, I disagree with
you on this point.  I think they shouldn't be required to obtain a license,
but everyone whom they serve food to should know that they don't have such a
license.  This would equal informed consent.  Also, with Food Not Bombs, many
of the people that the food is being served to is also involved in cooking,
distributing food, and cleaning up.  I've been told it's exactly like a big
picnic, except for anyone is invited to help and/or eat.
