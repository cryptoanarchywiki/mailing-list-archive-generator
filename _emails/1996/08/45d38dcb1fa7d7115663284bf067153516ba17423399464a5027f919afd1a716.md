http://www.panix.com/~sshah/ss-nyred.htm gives a detailed listing of New York 
City intersections where this is already being done.

http://www.eng.uci.edu/vtm/freeway.html describes the techniques used to monitor 
traffic speeds, etc. with a camera. Includes several pictorial examples.

http://www.azfms.com/faq.html (Arizona DOT) gives some interesting (but suspect) 
info about freeway / camera interaction, as well as a bunch of traffic webcams 
and links to similar sites. The claim is made that license plates can only be 
read by the camera when a vehicle is stopped...

http://www.best.com/%7Elspencer/geoch/ is a page hawking remote sensor devices 
(Butt-Sniffers) for identifying "gross polluter' vehicles. These same sensors 
are being deployed on California freeways in the Bay Area, and owners of "gross 
polluting" vehicles receive citations in the mail. The page includes details on 
the advantages of large companies using Butt-Sniffers on their employees' 
vehicles. "By finding gross polluting employee vehicles via remote sensing, and 
selectively repairing or scrapping them, the employer can gain AVR compliance." 
A great example of the (not-so) subtle arm-twisting CARB is doing to implement 
Smog Check II...

http://www.primenet.com/~rstbear/biffl.html Biff the Bear's Potty Cam! A great 
place for car-grabbing (and most other) bureaucrats to go.

"Today Americans would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore 
order; tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told 
there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that 
threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will 
pledge with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every 
man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenarios, individual rights 
will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well being granted to 
them by their world government."
--Henry Kissinger in an address to the Bilderberg organization meeting at Evian, 
France, May 21, 1992. Transcribed from a tape recording made by one of the Swiss 
delegates.
