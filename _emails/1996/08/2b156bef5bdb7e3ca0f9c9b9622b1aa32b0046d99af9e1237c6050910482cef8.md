I'm over it.  Hell, I can't even remember which side of this issue I'm 
on. ;-)   Oh, yeah...  I'm a sales-droid, looking for customers like 
a shark...  Never stop moving.....   Feed on the weak....   Yeah, 
that's where I'm at, yeah...

Anyway, the consensus is that what I'm doing (that I thought WAS 
spam) is about as harmless as a cold call, so I'm personally 
vindicated.

I like this next part:

I'm doing O.K., but I've go a product everyone still needs...  And 
the consumers I want have been on the Internet for a long, long time.
So all you geeky programmers (I mean that in the nicest way) buy your
stuff from ME!!!!  
Hey!!!  Was that SPAM!!!!  HEY!!!!!
