I wonder if someone's probing power-system vulnerabilities and defense 
strategies.

Just coincidental that there's been all this noise about power grid 
vulnerability and two vast regional outages this summer?

We spent an enjoyable evening around the oil lamps ... maybe it's not 
such a bad thing, this vulnerability......

   ... POOF!
