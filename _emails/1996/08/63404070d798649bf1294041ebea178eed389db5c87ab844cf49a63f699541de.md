     1) Not that I have noticed. I get people around here screaming and carrying 
on 24/7, and the cops just drive by looking for teenage black kids that look 
suspicious.

     2) Funny that isn't what I got out of listening to eye witnesses on the radio.

     The woman started screaming at Herr Klinton, then the goons moved in and she 
got more agaited. Her husband told her to shut up and not say anything else until 
he got an attorney, so the SS arrested him as well.

     Bullshit. Herr Klinton & goons desend into a crowd that _doesn't_ know they
are coming, and he starts to "press the flesh" with startled people, and one of them
starts to scream at him, that is not a death threat (especially given the political 
nature of what she was screaming. If she had said something like "I am going to kick
your ass", that would be a threat.).

     Funny, Miterand (sp?) used to wander around the streets of Paris with just one
or two body guards. 

     Besides, I like dead presidents. The more of them I have, the better.
