I've been planning to run a MUD like that, at mud.umop-ap.com port 2121.
I just don't have enough coded to be worth announcing yet.

Which cryptographic primitives should be coded in initially?

Obvious choices are:

Pseudonyms
Anonymous digital cash (issued by any pseudonym, not just "banks")
Public and private keys
Secret sharing
Anonymous broadcast & message pools
Anonymous markets

(ref: Tim May's sig)

What am I missing?  Should there be direct support for Jim Bell's
assasination markets?  It'd provide a means of demonstrating its
ineffectiveness as a means of social control.

I think that for purposes of simulation, it's reasonable to model
cryptographic primitives in a "Trust the server" mode, because you
need to trust the MUD server anyway (unlike a government), and it
puts a much lower load on the CPU.

There's also the question of log policy.  Having run a MUD for a few
years, I want to keep logs for bug detection.  A declared policy that
they aren't released for n years would work though.  Opinions, anyone?

Sent to Cypherpunks as well, in case anyone else is interested.
