However, those events are generally uncorrelated with usage...

Well, technically that's true, but these devices are usually running 
continuously, not merely when a call is being made.  In other words, more 
talk != more failures. 

For the most relevant (though minor) example that I can think of, consider 
the typical laser diode used to drive fiber optic cables.  These devices 
have a finite wearout mechanism (as opposed to most IC's which generally do 
not wear out in normal usage), so they may be seen to have a limited 
lifetime.  However, in use they are continuously transmitting data, even 
when portions of the channel are unoccupied, so they have a constant life 
regardless of individual phone usage.

This is an extraordinarily minor effect, as you might imagine.

If that is the main difference in costs, then we should abandon those regs.  
Another big cost is billing, which could be eliminated if usage were 
unmetered.   In any case, I tend to agree:  Make these changes, eliminate 
the LD/local subsidy, and  the LD companies would have no problem (at least 
domestically) competing against Internet phone.   (International may be a 
different story, because foreign telcos tend to be owned by countries.)
