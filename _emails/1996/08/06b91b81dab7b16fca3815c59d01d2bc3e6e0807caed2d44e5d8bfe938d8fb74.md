In Hong Kong, the Chinaman has the perfect way to describe
a situation like this. He will say, "Hey friend, a roach this 
big won't simply jump in the streets for you to catch."

The guys behind PGPn123 tried the same snail mail stuff 
recently. The response was so bad they gave up after a while.

Anyway, let's see what will happen in this case, but it's 
truly pathetic and ironic to think of snail mail in this 
cyberonic age.

Later...
