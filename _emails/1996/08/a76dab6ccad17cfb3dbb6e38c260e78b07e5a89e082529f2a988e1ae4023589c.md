I believe the issue involves Netscape's _method of distribution_, that is,
its placement of Navigator on a publically-accessible site with various
"checks" of who is trying to download it.

This is something the State Department could theoretically get involved
with, due to the ITARs and the way they are worded.

Actually approving of disapproving a piece of software for sale to U.S.
citizens is not currently possible.

(Though this is worrisome, speculatively. Various other weapons, such as
nukes and CBW, are in fact prohibited for sale to private citizens unless
approved. And sales of various guns are limited. So, if "crypto is a
munition," the same could perhaps apply. This runs into the "crypto as
speech" issue, of course.)
