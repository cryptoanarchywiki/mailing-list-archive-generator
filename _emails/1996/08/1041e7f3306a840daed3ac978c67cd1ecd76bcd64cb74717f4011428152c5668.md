What's the story with the tiger.team@tigerteam.org bounces?  I've been 
getting quite a few of these from time to time, once when sending a message
Sterndark.  In this case this message wasn't addressed to 
cypherpunks@toad.com, and it was a private message to Adam Back 
aba@dcs.ex.ac.uk...  I couldn't do a traceroute to dcs.ex.ac.uk since 
it's an unknown host to my system...  So perhaps, given the hit below, 
this is by uucp, but even so, should the bounced message come from 
tigerteam??

Is tigerteam somehow snarfing up messages they shouldn't?  Even if 
they're a uucp gateway to England, shouldn't the bounce come from 
dcs.ex.ac.uk and not from tigerteam/netcom???

I've a bunch of .gz files for the filtered cypherpunks list I run, they 
should contain stuff as far back as last year.  How would I get these to 
ya?
