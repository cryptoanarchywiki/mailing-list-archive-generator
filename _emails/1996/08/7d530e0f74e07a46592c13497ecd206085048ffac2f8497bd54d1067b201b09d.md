What I'd like to see -- for which technology is all in place, and
none of the shortcomings you mention apply -- is voice mail that
functions seamlessly between people who only have a phone, and
those with Internet connections on computers with a sound card.
Many companies practically use voice mail as an alternative to
long phone conversations. This might also help the Internet
spread, because with a connection you would be able to save  on
long-distance charges -- and strong crypto could be used.

I'm sure the software for this exists too -- the ISPs only have
to run it on their servers. It would be nice, though, if the ISPs
had a facility that when there is a voice message for you, it
either phones or pages you...
