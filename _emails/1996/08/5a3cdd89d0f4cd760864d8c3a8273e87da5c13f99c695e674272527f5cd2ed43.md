This is the single best suggestion/question I have heard about this entire case!

Why, indeed, has the 911 threat not been aired publically, where someone
might recognize the voice as being that of their brother, or boss, or
whatever? And might hear immediately that whomever it is, it ain't Richard
Jewell.

If any of you cyber-journalists who hang out here in the wings on
Cypherpunks, collecting material for stories, are reading this, please ask
your journalists covering the Atlanta bombing about this.
