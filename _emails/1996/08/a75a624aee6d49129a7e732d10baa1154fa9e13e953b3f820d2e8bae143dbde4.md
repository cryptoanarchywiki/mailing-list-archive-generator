I think the numbers have escaped you:  there are far more Macs than Unix
machines.  It doesn't matter that Unix has a larger market with
universities or Internet weenies, merely that overall more people use
Macs than Unix. Also, FWIW some of those Unix machines are Macs running
A/UX (Apple's Unix).

One last thought: Sun, Dec, SGI, etc all make RISC Unix machines.  Apple
is the largest RISC vendor on the planet...

Given that the Amiga is still around (and may be revived) despite the
fact that the Mac:Amiga ratio is probably the same as the PC:Mac ratio,
I'd say that it's quite likely Apple will stay around.  Inspite of the
hype about loses, Apple posted tens-of-millions-of-dollars profits last
quarter - rare for a dead company... <g>  They still cannot meet the
demand for the PowerBooks - probably the best notebook available at any
cost.
