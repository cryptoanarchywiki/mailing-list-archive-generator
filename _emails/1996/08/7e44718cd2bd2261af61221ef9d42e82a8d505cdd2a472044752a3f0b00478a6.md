Additionally, such statements are not actually directed at the fascists they
are addressed to.  We are well aware that they won't pay any attention to
them.  They are addressed to private readers.  In that case a good mix of
polite argumentation by EFF-type groups and "nuke 'em 'till they glow then
shoot 'em in the dark" rhetoric from the rest of us is probably the optimal
mix.  The goal is to convince a critical mass of people to choose to
exercise the freedoms they possess because of all our toys here on the Net.
Since people are different, a broad spectrum of argumentation is indicated.
