All webservers (except maybe Spinner?) are riddled with buffer overrun
bugs and other similar security holes.  If you run a webserver, you
should basically assume that anyone who really wants a shell on your
machine can get one.  Grab your favorite webserver and grep for
sprintf.

Crypto?  Get real.  The lock on the door matters little when you've
left the window wide open.
