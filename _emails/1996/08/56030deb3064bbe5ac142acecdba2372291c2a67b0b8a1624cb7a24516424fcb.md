You have to be able to imagine the advantages, and you can only imagine
them when you have the background to understand the difference between
having fewer choices rather than more, a limited market base rather than
an open one full of unlimited opportunity, and the increased domestic
tensions from frustrated consumers who are likely to set up blackmarkets
as work-arounds to the lack of desired goods & services. 

Essentially, you have to want to see, and work for, the difference
resulting from unprotected markets.   I think people who put up a lot of
objections are afraid and do not want any proof of their error.   You'd
have to hold their nose to the figures, and even then they might close
their eyes....
