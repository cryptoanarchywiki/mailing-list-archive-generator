The gereral consensus of the experts is that 168 bit 3DES is the best
choice.  DES has been well studied, 168 bit keys are large enough to be
safe, and the ITAR forbids its export.  (ITAR also forbids export of 128
bit cyphers as well, but ITAR is the only NSA approved reputation agent for
crypto, so we use what we have.)
