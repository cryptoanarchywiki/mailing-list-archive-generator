I kind of like this valid discussion going on. PERIOD. But I believe that 
although there's something (maybe, maybe not) politicians (be they 
Protestant, Palestinians or from Dresden) might find a misdemeanor, one 
shouldn't boast with possible unwarranted encryption.

No, seriously, your arguments tend to be belittled by your spelling. (Maybe 
you should get Pronto Secure, it has a spellchecker included)

BTW, I don't get paid by Commtouch for writing that (SNIF!).


A quick overview: beleive, politions, disscusion, orginised,
                  sponcered, orginization, wekness, vailid, Dresdin,
                  durring, expantion, Prodistant, Palisinians, 
                  unwarrented, PEROID, somthing, mistamener, mabye,
                  mabye not, possiable, encyrption, disscussing, bost

I hate teachers and people who show of with their spelling (and I'm a split 
personality). Yeah, me too.
