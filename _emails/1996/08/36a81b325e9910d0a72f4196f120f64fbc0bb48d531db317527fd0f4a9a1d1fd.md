OK.  But I sure would like to have an automatic weapon for
self/home/"national" defense w/o going through a tremendous amount of B.S.
(as Israelis are excused from).  I believe that you Texans and we Arizonans
have the privilege; in "urban" states, where the need truly is, good luck.

Also, I don't know what your experience in the Middle East is.  Me, I worked
in Iran and exited just before the Jan. '79 "revolution".  Menace & murder.
You *really* have no idea.  Hint:  I'm alive.

If you still (I don't know your age) think that humans are all the same, but
we juss gots diffrunt colors 'n' cultures, I *strongly* recommend an
extended period of travel to the third world.

In all sincerity,

Dave
