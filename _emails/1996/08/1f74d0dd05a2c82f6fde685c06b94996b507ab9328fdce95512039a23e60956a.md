It also hit the front page of the Oregonian (Portland's most stogy
newspaper).  They had a quote from the person who put up the page claiming
his reasons behind it was "that he did not like all those anonymous drivers

It will be interesting to see the state come out on the side of all those
anonymous drivers.
