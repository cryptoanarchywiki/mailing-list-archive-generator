At 11:13 AM 7/30/96 -0700, frantz@netcom.com (Bill Frantz) mused paranoidly:

When we discussed using FPGA machines to crack RC4/40 last year,
someone calculated the cost of cracking a message at 8 cents
if you're doing enough to amortize your machine, and Eric had designed
a system that should be able to crack it in about 15 minutes for $25-50K.
The two basic search approaches are to take a cyphertext and decrypt it
trying many keys to see if you get a likely plaintext, or to take known
plaintext and encrypt with many keys to see if you match the cyphertext.

But those designs are for one-at-a-time cracks.  An interesting question
is whether you can speed up performance substantially by cracking
multiple messages at once.  For instance, if you've got known plaintext,
such as a standard header format saying "FooVoice" or "BEGIN DSA-SIGNED..",
you can try many keys and compare them with _many_ cyphertexts,
which may not slow down the FPGA very much.  Also, even for
unknown-plaintext, since key scheduling is a relatively slow part of RC4/40,
you can split the key-schedule and the block-encryption phases, feeding
one keyschedule output to multiple decrypt-and-compare sessions in parallel.
So the cost per victim of cracking many sessions may be much lower.

Just keeping the key length down to 40 bits on a fast cypher is a good start.
