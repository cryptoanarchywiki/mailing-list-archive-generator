In Ontario, they tried this on some of the major highways.  The most
interesting thing about it was that it was proved time and time again
that the technology was not up to snuff: there was an almost 0% chance
of being caught.  When the license plate wasn't obscured or unreadable
(which it usually was) the computerized mailing system made some
stupid mistake that allowed the person to get off if they challenged
it.

The interesting thing is that the project was scrapped for these
reasons when the next government came in, but studies showed that it
_succeeded_ in lowering peoples speed limits.  I personally drove
consistantly about 20-40km over the speed limit while this was in
effect, cuz I knew it sucked, but apparently I was in the minorty.
