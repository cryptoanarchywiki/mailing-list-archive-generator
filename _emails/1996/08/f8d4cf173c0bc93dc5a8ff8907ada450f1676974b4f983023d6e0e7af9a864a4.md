The US version of Netscape 3.0 has been installed in /usr/pubsw for all
supported platforms, including Linux. /usr/pubsw can be mounted anonymously
via AFS. Is this true at other major universities? Is anyone interested in
prosecuting us? Nobody has ever complained about the PGP binary's being
available for years.
