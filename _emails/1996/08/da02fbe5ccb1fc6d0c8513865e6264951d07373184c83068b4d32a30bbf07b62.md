Hrmm... North Carolina requires 2 forms of ID, which can be an older
Driver's license, a SS card, a military ID, a birth certificate, or
(you'll love this one)...   "A filled in job application"... It doesn't
even have to be signed by the company, or any of that shit.  I can walk
over to RatShack, ask for an application, fill it out as "J. E. Hoover",
and its a valid form of ID at the DMV.
