I was taking economics back in the Armonk Iron days and we played around with
an economic simulation program written in Fortran.  One was supposed to
adjust government spending and taxes to find an optimum level.  I set both
taxes and spending to zero.  We got a lot of economic growth and a lot of
inflation (this was not a monetarist simulation).  But we were happier.
