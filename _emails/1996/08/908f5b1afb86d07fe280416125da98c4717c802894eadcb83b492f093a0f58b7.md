-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Cypherpunks,

I understand PGP Open-Signed messages and why they are used. I've 
read all the FAQ's. I can't seem to figure out why some of us put our 
Fingerprints and/or Key-ID's at the end of messages.

The answer to my question is probably in a FAQ somewhere and I'm 
missing it, I learn best by watching (visually) or by doing 
(experientially) so I'm having a little trouble learning from 
documentation.

In any case, if someone would spend a little time to explain, or 
point me in the right direction, I would be grateful.

Thanks,
Paul
