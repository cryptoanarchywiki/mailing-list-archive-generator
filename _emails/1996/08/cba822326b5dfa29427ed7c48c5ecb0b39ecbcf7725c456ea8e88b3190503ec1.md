Living in the UK, I really don't have that much idea where the people
on the list I've gotten to know over the years live.

I will be over in the San Francisco / Redwood City area next Saturday
(24th), if anyone I know would like to meet, exchange keys, have a
chat about crypto/cypherpunks stuff, mail me.

Also if there is any regular cpunks meeting in this area which
coincides, let me know!
