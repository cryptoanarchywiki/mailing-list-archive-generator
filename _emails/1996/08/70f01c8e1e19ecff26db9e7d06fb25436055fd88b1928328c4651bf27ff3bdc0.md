Thanks. Sometimes I need to throw back a few bottles of Pepto (or something
a little harder), but working in DC is sometimes rewarding and always
exciting.

A very solid suggestion.

I think this is a good idea for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is
that it would help define our issues for the Congress, the Administration,
the press, and the rest of the country. Partly because it's true and partly
because we are not as well organized as we could be, the perception of the
net.community on Capitol Hill is of a less-than-unified body politic.

This idea could help to change that attitude if it is done right.

I remember 2 years ago (I think?) VTW did something like this.  As I
recall, the only issue was Digital Telephony, and every member of Congress
(save 2 or 3) got an F. IMHO, this was not as effective as it could have
been, but it was a good start.  Our issues are much more front-and-center
than they were in 94, so this time around perhaps such and effort will have
more impact.

As far as I know, VTW is gearing up to do this again, though I haven't
spoken to Shabbir about his plans. If he or anyone else is seriously
considering doing this, I am certainly happy to contribute some time and a
few ideas to the effort.
