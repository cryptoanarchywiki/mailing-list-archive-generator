First off, let me say thank you to all of those who responded to my first 
message, I gained alot of useful information.

Mark Rogaski <wendigo@pobox.com> and I have decided to write up a RFC on it 
and are going through the initial stages of deciding on its functionality. 
 We would appreciate any and all useful input on the subject.  All ideas are 
welcome.

You can email my autoresponder (at this same address) to get the latest 
information on what we've decided.  Just make the subject GET KEYSERVER INFO 
for the response.

Thank you for your interest and help.
Rick Osborne
