I don't see how anyone can call this a bug. Microsoft has chosen what Sun
should have: leave the security to the user, don't take it away from
everyone. Java has been sverly crippled by the removal of features that
would have made applets truly usefull, like local disk access. By leaving
these abilities and allowing the user to choose whether or not to run the
object, leaves the trusted objects to be truly usefull. Microsoft has even
designed a system of trust verification for these objects throught the
trust chain and the MS download service. For details on the MS download
service look at the july 96 issue of Microsoft Systems Journal. Security
should be a user/parent decision not a general ban to protect a few.
