What alternative social orders can you envision that would handle this
problem elegantly? I can't think of any off the top of my head. 

Medical savings plans do not work for anyone but the extremely rich and
healthy, because few normal people can self-insure to cover the risk. With
pooled risk, the prospective customer has the right to know the risks
already in the pool before diving in. Contracts based on infinite
uncertaintly tend not to work.

There's also the little matter of letting your doctor know your medical
history. That data needs to be stored somewhere in clear text (as respects
my lack of involvement in the release, that is). If I'm unconscious, I can't
tell them my passphrase.
