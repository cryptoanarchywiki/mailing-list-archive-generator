We now post the virus warning dialog on local files (file: urls).  We have
always posted it on remote files (http: urls).  Note that the root of the
problem is not Java or the browser, but in macro-enabled applications.  IE3
has a mechanism to warn users about safety of documents when used with
common macro-enabled applications.  We are have updated Microsoft Word such
that by default it will not run macros embedded in documents.
