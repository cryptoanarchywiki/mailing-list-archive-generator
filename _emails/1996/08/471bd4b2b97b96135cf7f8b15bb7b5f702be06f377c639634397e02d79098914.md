I'm not approving this for comp.os.ms-windows.announce, but I figure it's
on-topic here (what isn't?). I was intrigued by their "proprietary
procedures to recover Windows NT installation with a lost administrator's
password." 

(The procedure I'd suggest: boot from a DOS or Linux floppy with an NTFS
driver. Back up all the application and data files you want saved. Reformat
the drive, install NT, and restore the saved files.) 

By the way, did you hear the one about the Microsoft tech support
recommendation to put the perl.exe interpreter into a world-executable
directory? www.bugnet.com

      *** Win NT / Internet Security Alert ***

      Our survey has shown that more than 50% of NT based Web Sites
do not pay proper attention to Internet security aspects. These sites are
extremely vulnerable, others are vulnerable to some extent.

      We were surprised to find that this relaxed approach to Windows NT /
Internet security does not depend on a size of a company, etc.
