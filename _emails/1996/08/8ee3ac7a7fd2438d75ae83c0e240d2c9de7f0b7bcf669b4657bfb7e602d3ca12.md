"Do all the work I should be doing or have done in the first place
discover the critical flaws in my new-keen-o-ka-jive-o crypto system and I
will give you a free copy of a critically flawed crypto system (a $99.00
value) ABSOLUTELY FREE.  Wait, don't order yet.  Included you also get to
actually whitewash my fence and then mow my lawn.  All at NO COST to you."
