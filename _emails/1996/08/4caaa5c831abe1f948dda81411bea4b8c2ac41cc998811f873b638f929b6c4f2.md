Maybe '!number' was making it up, but license plate photography 
exists today in the Great White North.  A new freeway is being 
built through Brampton, the 407ETR, for Express Toll Route.  
At each on and off ramp there are electronic pickups and video 
cameras.  You can subscribe to the toll by buying a transducer 
that sits behind your rear-view mirror, signals from which will 
be picked up by the the toll gates as you enter and leave the 
freeway.  If you elect not to subscribe your license plate will 
be photographed and you'll get a bill in the mail.  If you elect 
not to pay the bill you'll be nabbed for it the next time you go 
to get your drivers license or car registration renewed...

Big Brother is not only watching, he's recording your location
and destination, measuring your distance travelled, and charging 
you for the privilege of driving...
