I've gotten dozens of these "Message  body suppressed" things, including
copies of my _own_ messages sent out a couple of days ago (and received OK
the first time around).

It looks like " ns.netscape.com " got a copy from toad.com (see bottom of
block below), bounced it around within Netscape, and then resubmitted it to
toad.com (see top of block below), minus the message body.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
