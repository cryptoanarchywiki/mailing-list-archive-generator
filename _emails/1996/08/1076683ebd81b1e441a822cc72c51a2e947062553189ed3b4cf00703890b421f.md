Hmmm. Actually a long time ago I lost my job with Greenpeace out of refusal
to sign an I-9 which was in '86 the Department of Justice's form to exhibit
eligibility to work in the US. The form required that I present two pieces
of photo identification or a driver's license to be authenticated by my
employer. Maybe it's a CA state law that adds an additional skin tone
criterium to for the filing of an I-9.
