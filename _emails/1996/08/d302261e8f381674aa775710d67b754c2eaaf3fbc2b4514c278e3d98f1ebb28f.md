In the case cited above, I confirmed with the store's credit department that a
Canadian passport was not considered a valid piece of ID. I suggested that this
was due to credit concerns but they denied this. For obvious reasons, I did not
believe them.

My opinion is that a rule that stated "two pieces of ID that showed credit
worthiness" was either too complicated or too unpalatable to use. Instead, the
rule is "two pieces of ID" with the definition of ID tacitly restricted to items
that indicate credit status. Either that, or Canadian passports are too easy to
get forged in Ottawa.

This "keep it simple stupid" approach showed itself this week when I attempted
to order replacement cheques from my bank over the phone. I was told that they
needed my signature, but a signed fax request would be sufficient. I remarked
that it was trivial to apply a forged signature to a fax. The response from the
person was - wait for it - that I would then have to come in and sign for it in
person. It was impossible to convince them that this was not just a problem with
my fax machine, but a problem in general.

Eventually, I typed up a fax request in Word, pasted in my previously scanned
signature, and sent this to the bank. This made them happy, but I might be
changing banks soon.

In the physical world, a big lock or a steel door can indicate good security.
Most people can evaluate the strength of this type of security fairly well.
Until we have good analogies for the equivalent types of digital security, we
will continue to face real problems.
