This was not an interview, but an article.  Though all quotes are 
accurate (and checked with the source) it was me who did the choosing, so 
it's really not fair to fault Dorothy for not addressing issues x and y, 
etc.For a more comprehensive defense of her position you can go to her 
web site, where she has lotsa position papers.

Incidentally, I didn't set out to rehash the Clipper issues in the 
article, but to try to give some insight into Dorothy herself.
