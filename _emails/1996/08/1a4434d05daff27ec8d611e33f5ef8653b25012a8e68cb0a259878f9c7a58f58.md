Actually, in Oregon I don't think there is any restriction as to what purposes you ask 
for the information.  I've never filled out such a request before 
(preferring to get my data from a CDROM which tells no tales...) but as I 
understand it there's no restriction.  (Other than legality?!?)

I've pointed out elsewhere that our goal should be the elimination of the 
collection of this data by the state in the first place, an appropriately 
radical idea.
