I too find this concept offensive, at least to the extent that it is kept a 
secret from the marketplace. Even so, as a libertarian and free-market 
capitalist, I certainly see nothing wrong with "allowing such behavior," and 
indeed  I'd see something wrong with NOT "allowing" it.  Nevertheless, to 
the extent it occurs it should be well understood and identified for what it 
is.

You might recall the Intel 386SX microprocessor, which was the 16-bit-bus 
version of the 386 DX, which itself had a full 32-bit bus.  At the time the 
DX was selling for many hundreds of dollars, probably about $3-400 or so,  
Intel sold the SX for about $80.  However, chances are good that the only 
difference internally between these devices is the bus interface unit, so 
the size and complexity of these two chips would have been virtually 
identical, and thus their costs would likewise be the same.  The reason for 
their vast difference in price was this "damaged goods" concept.  (A similar 
situation occurred with the 486SX versus the 486DX.)
