Build 1381 is the final release of NT 4.0, not a beta version.  Build 1381 was
released to OEMs about a week and a half ago.  It should reach a retail outlet
near you before September.

There is no free upgrade from the beta version of NT 4.0 to the final version.
You may want to purchase a copy from Microsoft, or sit in IRC for a while and
wait for someone to hand it to you.
