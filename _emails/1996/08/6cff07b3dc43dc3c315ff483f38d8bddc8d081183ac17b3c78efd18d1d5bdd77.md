Just because someone at your door has a warrant or a contractual right to
search your place does not require you to allow anyone else in.  Par example:

Landlord of (A Member of This List):  The fire inspectors are here and would
like to inspect your apartment.

(A Member of This List):  They got a warrant?

Landlord of (A Member of This List):  No.

(A Member of This List):  Then they can't come in.

Landlord of (A Member of This List):  But I can enter the apartment with
reasonable notice under the rental agreement.

(A Member of This List):  You're welcome.  The Fire Inspectors aren't.

Landlord of (A Member of This List) who allowed a search of the rest of his
building was cited by the Fire Inspectors for an illegal apartment in the
basement.
