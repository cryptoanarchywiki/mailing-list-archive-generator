Funny, one of my customers is involved in the Texas gun lobby and through
him I am aware of literaly hundreds of people who are within a few miles of
Austin who have FFL's and have no problem selling weapons off their kitchen
table completely legal. Their prices in general are much lower than local
stores such as McBrides (the best known in Austin).
