Don't forget the bus.  Of course you can still drive a car without a DL.
Just don't get stopped.  Additionally, driving without a license is a pretty
minor offense.  Stick with cheap cars so confiscation isn't a problem.  Most
also forget that the Driver's License can be issued by any nation on earth.
Some countries have easier standards for license issuance.

Strange facts about cars and drivers in the US:

1)  It is legal for an unlicensed driver to own or drive an unregistered car
as long as he stays off the public streets and roads (what for expansion of
the definition of public streets and roads).

2)  It is legal for a licensed driver to drive a car owned by some other
person or legal entity.  Ownership and control can be two different things.

3)  A car can be registered in other states or in other countries and still
be driven anywhere in the US.

4)  A licensed driver is one with a license from any jurisdiction on earth
(try to stick to ones most cops have heard of).

5)  A US court cannot suspend a foreign license (but they can bust you for
other stuff if you get caught in the same local jurisdiction twice.)

At least the Passport doesn't have your address or much useful information
on it.  And if you've done things properly, it's not connected to your SS
number.  Should work for flight ID at the airport these days, however.
