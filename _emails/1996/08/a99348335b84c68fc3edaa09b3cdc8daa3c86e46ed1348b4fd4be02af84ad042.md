The timing of the revelation of the investigation's interest in Jewell, the 
rent-a-cop, is highly suspicious.  We have now learned that (contrary to 
previous reports that the bomb exploded 18 minutes after the warning was 
given by telephone), in fact the 911 people wasted about 10 minutes trying 
to figure out the address of the park.  Even though this story did indeed 
get reported by the media, a little, "as if on cue" the interest in Jewell 
was leaked. It gives the media something to talk about other than the known 
official screwup.

A coincidence?
