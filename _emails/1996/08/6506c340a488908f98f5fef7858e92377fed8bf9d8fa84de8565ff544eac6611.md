Shielding EMF/ELF is very difficult. I had a customer who had a wobbly
monitor and the solutions just to shield the monitor from some ELF
interference was in the $1k range. Check out this site:
http://www.noradcorp.com/faq1.htm
A little primer on ELF radiation. And putting foil in the wall will do
nothing except possibly spreading the radiation to a wider area. (Like
using frosted glass. :)
