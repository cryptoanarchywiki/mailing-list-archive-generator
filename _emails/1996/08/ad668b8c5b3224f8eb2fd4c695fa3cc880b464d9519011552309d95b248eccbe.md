This is exactly what a new lawsuit recently filed against Microsoft is
about.  See

They've already had their hand slapped for the per-processor license
agreements they pushed in the early '90s.  The per-processor licenses
were where Microsoft forced hardware vendors to pay a certain fee
based on CPUs sold regardless of what system software was delivered on
them.
