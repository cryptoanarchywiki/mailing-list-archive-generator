Bandwidth costs almost nothing, unless you are doing full motion
video.

What is expensive is cutting that bandwidth up into little pieces 
and delivering those pieces to the people who want to use it at
the time that they want to use it.

Thus those who retail bandwidth will have the bulk of the revenue,
rather than those who wholesale it.
