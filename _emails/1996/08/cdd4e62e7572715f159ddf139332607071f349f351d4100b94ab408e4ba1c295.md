I fail to see why/how the initial swap of  TrustBucks(Alice) for
TrustBucks(Bob) followed by Alice returning the TrustBucks(Bob) [as
supposed payment] differs from her just paying with the TrustBucks(Alice)
in the first place [ie: He is willing to accept the TrustBucks(Alice) as
payment for the TrustBucks(Bob) that she will use to pay off her debt]. The
net result is the same - Bob has the same amount of TrustBucks(Bob) in
circulation and has an amount of TrustBucks(Alice) equal to Alice's payment
[the back and forth of the TrustBucks(Bob) is just playing "Right
Pocket/Left Pocket"].
