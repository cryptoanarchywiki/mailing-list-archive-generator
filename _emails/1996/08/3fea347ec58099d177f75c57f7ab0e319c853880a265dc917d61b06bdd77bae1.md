Your view point doesn't really fit the facts, but since it is not the
issue here, I'll let it go. Can't resist like someone has to pay those 80,000+ 
employees at AT+T.

Exactly! Once "X-Phone" has its servers in US Cities, and its charging 10 cents 
a minute for long distance calls, I don't see if the phonecos would be able to provide any service that people are willing to pay for, I mean they won't
be able to provide matching lucrative rates. 

You mean to say that, X-Phone will take advantage of the phoneco and mint 
money for a minimal investment, whereas the phoneco who spent billions on the
infrastructure will be just whistle down the road, and let the X-Phone 
indulge in its own cyberdo.
 
Its like you write a book and the cover designer sells it in his name.

Best,
