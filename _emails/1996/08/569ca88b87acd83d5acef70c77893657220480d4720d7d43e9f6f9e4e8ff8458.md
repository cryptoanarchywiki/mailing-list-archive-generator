Y'all:

The South Florida Cypherpunks will meet at Hops Grill & Bar
in Boynton Beach, FL on Saturday, August 17 at 2:00 PM.  As
always, our meeting place is at a microbrewery, and this one
has some very fine brews.

In addition, the Cypherpunks Brewmaster, Jim Ray, is brewing 
up a special "summer dark" brew for the meeting.  We will 
enjoy his swill^H^H^H^H^Hfine beer at my house following the
meeting.*

I'll post directions to Hops as we get closer to the meeting
time and put a map on my web page at:

  http://www.c2.net/~winsock/

Please send me a note if you plan to attend so that I can alert
the NSA^H^H^Hrestaurant on how many will attend.  Send me your
key and fingerprint for keysigning if it hasn't been signed by any
subversives^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hcypherpunks before.

* All joking aside, Jim is a very fine brewmaster.  I just wish
he'd spend a few bucks and ferment in something other than 2 liter
coke bottles that explode in someone's truck...

Regards,
