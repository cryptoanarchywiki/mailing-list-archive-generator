There was nothing to defend. To the best of my knowledge, nobody suggested
that DS be thrown off the list. One joker unsubed Sternlight, but that was
hardly something that he couldn't fix himself. Did I want him on the list?
Hell no. Do I believe he has a right to join the list? Yes, with one
possible exception. The list owner can ban anybody, since the list is using
the owner's resources. In this case, from a libertarian standpoint, not
even an explanation of such an action would be required.

   Defeat the Demopublican Unity Party. Vote no on Clinton/Dole in November.
   Vote Harry Browne for President.
