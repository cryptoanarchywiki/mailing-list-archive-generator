    Let's clarify something here. I am not complaining about these
fruitcakes who want to help the homeless retain their drug & alcohol
stupors, by taking care of them the way one takes care of a child - buying
the food, cooking the food, putting the food on their plate, etc. 

I anm referring to the homeless people who stake out "their" peice of a 
publicly owned real estate, and set up a continuing residence - cardboard 
or better box, ersatz cooking facilities, etc, etc. And then start acting 
out their own particular psychoses. Which typically involves accosting 
passersby, or worse.

Ya know, if these homeless folks were even doing this stuff with decorum,
 and not making disturbances and assaulting people, I for one wouldn't
give a shit.  Some may recall, as I do, the report in the New York Times a
few years ago about a chap who set up household 30 feet up in a tree in
Central Park. He was living there for 2 years before the Park Rangers
noticed and then evicted him. The fellow had several rooms, and even
running water. Don't ask me how. 

I admire that dude.
