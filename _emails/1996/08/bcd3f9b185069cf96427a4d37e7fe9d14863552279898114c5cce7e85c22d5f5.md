Getting back to the Dining Crypto Problem, is it possible to complete a
round by passing information around the circle of participants (each
individual communicates and maintains a connection with the person on the
left and right) rather than sending the round results to everyone via a
central server that everyone is connected to? In effect no one would be a
server, or everyone would be a server depending on the way you look at it.
A circular linked list would be maintained and kept in sync by every
client so that error recovery could come into play if someone mysteriously
disconnects. Could it work? How would the protocol differ.

Also I need info on the Disco problem, detecting if someone is tampering.

Thanks.

- Lester
