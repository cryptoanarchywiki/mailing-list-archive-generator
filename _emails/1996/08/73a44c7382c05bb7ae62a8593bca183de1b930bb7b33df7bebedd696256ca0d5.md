Some guy has written an ActiveX control which crashes windoze95... I don't
use windoze so can't try it, but if someone else is brave, I'd love to know
if it works...

Information page with a link to a page which loads the control:

	http://www.halcyon.com/mclain/ActiveX/

Quote from the page:

Exploder is an Active X control which demonstrates security problems with 
Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Exploder performs a clean shutdown of 
Win95 and will turn off the power on machines that have a power
conservation BIOS (green machines).

   Ken Thompson has an automobile which he helped design.  Unlike most
   automobiles, it has neither speedometer, nor gas gage, nor any of the
   numerous idiot lights which plague the modern driver.  Rather, if the
   driver makes any mistake, a giant "?" lights up in the center of the
   dashboard.  "The experienced driver", he says, "will usually know
   what's wrong."
