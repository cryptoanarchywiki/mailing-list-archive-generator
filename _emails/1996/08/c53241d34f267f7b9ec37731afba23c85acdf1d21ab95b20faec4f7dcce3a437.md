No rush, Tim.  I've got the whole thing on CDROM.  In fact, the person who 
put the thing on the net got the data from me...through a friend.  I bought 
it from a person who's been selling CDROM's of this data for a couple of 
years.  The most recent revision (and the one that's on the 'net) is about 4 
months old.  

So far, what's been put on the net is merely the "license plate # to 
address" lookup.  We also have the "name to address" data...
