	I can see some cryptographic implications to distributed
documents, such as the relatively obvious one of making sure your competitor
can't tap into them.

Subject: Research Position at Rank Xerox Research Centre, Cambridge

Research Position in Distributed Document Technologies at Rank Xerox Research
Centre, Cambridge


Rank Xerox Research Centre, Cambridge Laboratory is part of an expanding
European based research centre which includes a second site in Grenoble.  The
Cambridge Laboratory carries out interdisciplinary research in the development
and use of technologies for supporting distributed organisations, with a strong
emphasis on the human and organisational aspects of technology in use.  The
laboratory has close links with a number of divisions of Xerox and Rank Xerox,
and collaborates with other research groups in the UK, continental Europe and
the US.

Our research programme (Studies of Technology, Organisations and Work) combines
social science and technical perspectives on the design of systems for use in
the workplace. Our current research projects are examining the boundaries
across which distributed document work is conducted. In formulating our
long-term research strategy we are focusing on investigating these in terms of
personal; inter- and intra- organisational; work-practice; cultural; temporal,
and geographical boundaries, and developing ways to take account of their
implications for system design.

We are seeking a research scientist to play a major role in developing new
approaches to distributed document technology from this perspective. The
appointee is likely to have a background in computer science or a related
discipline, with an understanding of distributed and collaborative
technologies. Applicants are expected to have a keen interest not only in the
infrastructural issues of distributed systems, but also in incorporating
social, organisational and psychological dimensions of work into the design and
development of novel networked systems. The appointed person will take primary
responsibility for the technological component of our programme and will join a
multi-disciplinary team involving computer science, pychology and sociology.

(Applicants for the recently advertised post in Requirements for Distributed
Services need not re-apply as they will automatically be considered for this
position.)
