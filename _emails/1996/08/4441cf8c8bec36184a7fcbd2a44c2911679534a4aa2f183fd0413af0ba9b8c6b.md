I do not know much about how SSL works, but SSH (Secure Shell) has
a nice safety built in. It creates  a database of known hosts and
for each connection it matches the current host certificate (public
key) with the old public key from the ssh's database of known
hosts. If the keys mismatch, a warning is issued.

It actually works. Maybe the same logic should be used in SSL?
