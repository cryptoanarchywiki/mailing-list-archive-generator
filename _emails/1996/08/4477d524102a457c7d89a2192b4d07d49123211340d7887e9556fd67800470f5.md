We did this in California, remember? You just need to target someone who's
been on TV.

I quite agree. But make it a controlled burn. Log everything. Restrict bulk
downloads. You don't need to let the genie all the way out of the bottle to
say "look, a genie."

It might be fun to make the database open for a couple weeks, without a
caveat about logging, and then publish the logs. Allow reverse lookups,
i.e., who looked up my record.  A nice little dragnet of people who are
interested in invading your privacy. 

For the near-medium term, I am resigned to the fact that government is going
to collect personal information, and that it is going to leak out. I'm just
interested in full disclosure of the leaks, and who is benefiting from them.
