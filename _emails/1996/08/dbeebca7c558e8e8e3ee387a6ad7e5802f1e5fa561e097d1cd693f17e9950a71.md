Unicorn,

Peer review seems to have voted that their risk paid off.

You misinterpreted my reply to a list member's enquiry about whether 
our offer of Pronto Secure in exchange for feedback was still 
available. 
 
> This is a subjective question.
Yes.

Unicorn, you are again letting your fingers move faster than your 
brain. On what do you base your evaluation of our liquidity ? (not that 
it is relevant). Most Cypherpunks are technically savvy and crypto 
aware people, they provide a perfect community for evaluating and 
debugging a security enabling product. I would strongly recommend this 
route to any developer of serious security enhancing software. My 
sincere thanks to all c'punks who have and continue to provide 
incredibly valuable input into Pronto Secure.

Unicorn, you are again making groundless assumptions. I suggest that 
you do some fence painting before you enlighten us with your opinions 
about our "kiss ass paragraphs" of code.
Unless Michael Jordon is reading Schneier on the sly, his endorsement 
of Pronto secure is not worth 99c.

> Alturisim is a pipe dream.
Depends what you are putting in your pipe :)
I venture that most c'punks would agree that moving strong e-mail 
security into mainstream is a good thing. This is not going to happen 
without people making money from it.

>> Unicorn, you are invited to whitewash my fence :)
> Do I have to review pronto secure first?
Yes.

Geoff.
