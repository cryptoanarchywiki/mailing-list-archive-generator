In Missouri, that's all they wanted (a PO Box).  That's
perfectly copacetic by them.  If you want to register for
voting - since we have Motor Voter - they of course need
a real address.  And the post office's requirements for
getting a PO Box are nearly nonexistent.

I like that - email on cheques.  Wish I'd thought of that before
I ordered my last batch.
