And when this $2 B is defeated by encryption, look for dramatic, drastic,
and draconian restrictions on crypto.

(With the Internet Phone deals--even Intel is entering the market--why are
there no widespread uses of PGP or S/MIME? Yes, I know about about PGPhone,
and also the Nautilus product, but none seem to be used by anyone I know.
Maybe we should spend some time talking about the practical realities of
these tools.)

Boycott "Big Brother Inside" software!
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
