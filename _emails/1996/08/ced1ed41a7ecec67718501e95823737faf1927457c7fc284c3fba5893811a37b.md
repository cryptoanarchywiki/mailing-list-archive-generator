C'punks,

The electronic newsletter put out by the TV show, C-NET Central, 
had this item in the most recent issue:

------------------------------------------------------------------

5. "YOUR TURN": SHOULD YOU BE ABLE TO READ BOMB-MAKING INFO?

The United States and seven other governments are moving to
"felonize" distribution of bomb-making information on the Net
and other electronic media. Yet censorship of the Net was
recently dealt a double blow by twin defeats of the
Communications Decency Act. Is this strictly a free speech
issue? Or is there a difference in your mind between pictures of
naked people and blueprints for a pipe bomb? And can the Net
know the difference?

To contribute your opinion, phone CNET at 415/395-7805, enter
extension 5400, and leave a message. We'll listen to the
responses and broadcast some of the best on CNET radio.

Each week Digital Dispatch brings you the new "your turn"
question, and each Wednesday you can hear the responses to the
previous week's question on CNET radio:

Some of you may have a comment about this subject.
