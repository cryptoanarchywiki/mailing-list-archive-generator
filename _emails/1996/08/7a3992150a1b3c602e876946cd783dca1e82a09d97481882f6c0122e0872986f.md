Slightly off topic:

I haven't seen this horror of GAK discussed here, but this is (IMHO) as
important as possible abuse by LEA's.

Let's factor the LEA's out for a bit.

The US government gets their mandatory key access, and keeps their keys in
three databases in various locations.

Most foreign powers would pay someone a handsome sum to hand over these
keys.  I would bet that France or Iran would offer a billion dollars to
someone who would turn over the part of the database they preside over.

I bet that France/Iran/etc. would be able to pool together 3 billion
dollars and a nice getaway for the stooges who can grab a tape with the
escrowed keys on it.  Heck, Ames turned traitor for less.  (I am assuming
the keys as small, 1K bytes each... an 8mm Exabyte mammoth tape would be
able to carry 30 million keys.)  Even an "el cheapo" Travan TR3 tape would
be able to snarf 1.6 million keys... and that's a lot of people
compromised!

Soon, you have the US's whole security structure totally compromised.
Any business transactions, any communications are now subject to tapping
by foreign agents, and all US crypto would be absolutely powerless.  And
you thought ITAR put companies at a disadvantage. US companies would
be stomped on by competition which seems to have the same product just
slightly earlier or slightly more refined, or they would move out of the
US, so they can use strong crypto.

Even if one assumes that the LEA's are incorruptable, there are always
people who are willing to watch their country go down in flames for money.
