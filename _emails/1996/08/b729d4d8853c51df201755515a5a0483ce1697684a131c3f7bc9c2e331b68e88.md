Flash powders are quite easy to make and deflagrate quickly enough to
cause quite a nice bang without any containment what so ever when set off
in amounts over about two tablespoons worth.

Start off with fine enough mesh Al powder and grind your oxidizer down
fine enough and all you need for proper mixing is a (static treated)
zip-lock bag.

Not that I would ever suggest that anyone try to manufacture such
mixtures, but they are plenty potent enough to match and exceed most
manufactured deflagrating powders.
