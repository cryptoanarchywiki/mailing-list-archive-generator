To anyone who's read the PGPfone docs, this sounds very similar,
PGPfone uses 3DES (as one option: also CAST, Blowfish), but it's a 2
key 3DES rather than 3 key (I think).  PGPfone works with
9600/14400/28800 modems, uses Diffie Hellman key exchange, uses a
commitment to exchanges by passing the hashes of the exchanges prior
to traditional dh key-exchange (we'll see if this compares to what is
described here as an `interleave protocol').  PGPfone offers several
GSM codecs.

Do you see any barrier to PGPfone being able to interoperate with your
product once your specs are published?  (Aside from a fast PC/MAC to
keep up -- 3DES is the most computationaly expensive encryption
algorithm used by PGPfone).

Also I believe I read somewhere in your announce that upgrades are
possible -- can these happen in software only?  Flash BIOS upgrade?
If it is software upgradable are you releasing the programming specs
also?

A very nice product, sure beats the hell out of clipper based phones,
and the various snake oil offerings,

Adam
