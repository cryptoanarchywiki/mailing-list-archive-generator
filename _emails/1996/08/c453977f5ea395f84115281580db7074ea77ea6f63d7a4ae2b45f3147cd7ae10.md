	One wonders if they could be persuaded, in return for a donation of
money or time, to include some cypherpunks-related web pages; these could
include ones on PGP and on anonymous remailers, so they could later get email &
ftp access and use these.

>   Inside the yellow-and-black big rig in the Pacoima section of Los
