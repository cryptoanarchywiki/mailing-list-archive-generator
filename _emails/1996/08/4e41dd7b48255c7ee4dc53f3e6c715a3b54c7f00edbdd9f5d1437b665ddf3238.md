Declan:

What are you thinking?!

In a world where we have very few real friends, I simply don't understand
what you are trying to accomplish. It's fine (and healthy) to raise
concerns about the particular positions a member of Congress takes (hell, I
don't agree with everything Leahy does), but to simply dismiss Leahy as a
'no friend of the Net'  is naive and counterproductive.

Look at the record. Leahy is hands down the strongest supporter of the Net
in Congress. Period. No other Member (including our small but growing
handful of other friends like Burns, White, Wyden, Cox, Eshoo, etc) has
been a more forceful or consistent advocate for your causes for as long as
Leahy has. What exactly do you want? Perhaps we should elect you to
Congress and see how well you can do.

Of course we are not going to agree with our friends on every issue. If
Leahy takes a position you don't like, I'd suggest you talk to his office.
I have found in my experience that Leahy's staff (and him personally) will
take the time to listen when presented with a well presented argument.

I'm also confused about another thing: which hat were you wearing when you
wrote this? If it is your "advocate" hat I think it must covering your
eyes. If it's your "journalist" hat, you need to do a bit better job of
checking your facts in the future.

Go a head and reject the "Beltway politicians". It's fashionable, sure, but
what does it really accomplish?  Some of them are dangerous. Others are
sympathetic. The fact is that short of armed rebellion they are going to be
here for a while.
I shudder to think of the wrath our opponents could wage if we all threw up
our hands packed up our bags and left town.

Face the facts. Members of Congress have a lot of constituencies to deal
with, and we are a small and relatively powerless faction. We can do a lot
to change the outcomes of policy debates (if I didn't believe that I
wouldn't be doing what I do everyday), but we have to be realistic,
recognize where we fit in to the process and who are friends are.  One
thing's for sure - we have A LOT more enemies than we have friends.

Most members of Congress don't really understand us or our issues.  Many
are willing to learn, and some have been real champions for our causes.
But none of them are gong to continue reaching out a hand to us if we bark
and bite when we don't get 100% of our way. Zealots rarely win (though it
sure is fun to throw bombs).

Sorry for the public thrashing, but this kind of attitude REALLY gets under
my skin.

Flames welcome (though response is not guaranteed <g>),

Jonah
