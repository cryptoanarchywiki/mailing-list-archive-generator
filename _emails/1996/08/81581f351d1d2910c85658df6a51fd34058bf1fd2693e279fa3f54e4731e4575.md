I don't see a problem with that. All governments are corrupt by definition.
As far as I know, the U.S. is the only country in the world prohibiting
its businesses from bribing foreign officials with the silly law known
as the Foreign Corrupt Practices act (as if U.S. politicians didn't take
bribes!) The results are: U.S. businesses not being competetive in the
international markets where bribes are the traditional part of doing
business, and a significant paperwork/compliance cost in all other
international markets.
