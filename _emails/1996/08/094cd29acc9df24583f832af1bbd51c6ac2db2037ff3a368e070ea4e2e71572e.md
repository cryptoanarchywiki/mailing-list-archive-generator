This, of course, was my exact point. I don't buy the argument that Kennesaw
(or whatever) was just making a symbolic point. If one community passes a
law which mandates the ownership of guns, in contravention to the Second
Amendment, then another community could ban ownership of guns, using the
same logic and "general principal."

(Several have, of course. I think such laws violate the Second Amendment,
but apparently the courts do not agree.)

And what of making a "citizen's arrest" of a "perp" who refuses to own a
gun. I prefer not to have to guess which laws are real and which are merely
posturing.
