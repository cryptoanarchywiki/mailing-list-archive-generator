So _THAT'S_ how they could have prevented the atrocity.  ;>

Weakening caused by the stress of stamping, the immensity of the
number of cartidges fired every day in the U.S., and the fact that
revolvers *exist* aside, we have these strange people called
"reloaders" in this country, Phill, and right now they have LOTS of
unstamped brass on hand. Criminals who wanted it would have an
unlimited supply into the foreseeable future. I agree with you that
criminals are, on the whole, dumber than cypherpunks, but it is easy
for them to pick up ideas like shooting a few hundred rounds or filing
a barrel etc. whether or not they are as likely as we are to have them
first. They already use all-fabric bleach to get any blood/DNA out of
clothing used in crimes, and even if they ARE stupid, they sit around
jail cells an awful lot talking about how to get away with their
crimes next time. JMR
