	be used for identification purposes, because of errors 
	made in isseing the numbers.

	Specifically, 5% of the numbers were issued to two or more
	people.  3% of numbers were issued to people who allready
	had one or more numbers.  A further 3% to 5%  were issued
	in error for other reasons.
