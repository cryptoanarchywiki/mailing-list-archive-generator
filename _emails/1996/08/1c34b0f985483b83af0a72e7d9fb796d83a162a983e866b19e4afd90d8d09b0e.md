Hardly a proved correlation. A lot of other factors come into play. But
never mind. No point arguing.

A straw man. There is is no evidence that these startup companies are
dumping stuff in rivers. Jeesh. The point is that large companies learn how
to keep large staffs employed filling out paperwork, and they actually have
come to see it is a good way to keep small companies from forming.

Then you weren't reading the thread, which in several posts described this
very situation. "Food Not Bombs" was giving away soup, chile, and other
such stuff at a park in Santa Cruz (and maybe elsewhere, e.g., San
Francisco). They were busted.

Now do you understand the situation?
