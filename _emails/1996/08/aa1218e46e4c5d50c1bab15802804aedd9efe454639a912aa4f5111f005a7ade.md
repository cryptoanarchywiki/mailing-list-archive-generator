It was in fact "Food Not Bombs" which I was referring to in my post a few
days ago.

My point to the City Council was one of inconsistency (picnic groups not
similarly hassled). Also, the use of "permits" to harass/muzzle a group.

"Permits" are often used to stop speech and acts which are not considered
acceptable. Drawing on my own community for an example, Santa Cruz tried to
regulate palm readers, astrologers, mystics, and seers. This eventually
fell apart, possibly when the implications became clear to the bureaucrats
(the future was already clear to the Cassandras, but nobody believed them).

My "Licensed Ontologist" line in my .sig was added during one of the
debates about the claimed need to license and regulate persons in various
professions.

(There are of course the usual other examples, where job unions and cartels
stop "outsiders" from participating. Often for ostensibly good reasons, but
"guilds" nonetheless. The implications of crypto anarchy for these guilds
are left as exercises for the student.)
