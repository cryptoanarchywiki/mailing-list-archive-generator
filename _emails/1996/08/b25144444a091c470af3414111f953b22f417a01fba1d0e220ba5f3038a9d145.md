On the gripping hand, if you (a generic you not TM) were in a park at 1:15
am listening to Jack Mack and the Heart Attacks in a crowd with infants in
strollers, etc and a pipe bomb went off you could just consider it part of
the rich stew of punk/pop crossover sensibilities that have become so
important in modern life.  Those who seek a "Heart Attack" may get one.  

If you hang out in modern crowds you risk getting blown up by fame seeking
cop wanabees (or getting your FBI file read by ex-bouncer political heavy
wanabees or getting kneecapped by body-guard-to-the-stars wanabees).  Note
the physical and psychological similarities among Jewell, Livingstone, and
Tanya Harding's boyfriend.

Didn't your mothers tell you what happened if you hung out in public parks
after midnight.  Or as Republicans said to the TV set when Teddy was
chanting "Where Was George?" during his speech at the 1988 Democratic
National Convention; "Sober and at home in bed with his wife."

There is something very counter survival about seeking out crowds.  It has
always been thus.
