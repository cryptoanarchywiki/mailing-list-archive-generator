I have not heard of anyone doing this with the Intel code, but I have seen
info on the "Secret APIs of Bill" (Undocumented Windows API calls) being
used in various programs.  (For more info on this, check out "Undocumented
Windows" by Schulman, Maxey, and Pietrek.)

I am sure that the people who produce SoftIce could give you more info on
this.  (Either that or talk with whoever is doing the undocumented feature
column for Dr. Dobbs.)
