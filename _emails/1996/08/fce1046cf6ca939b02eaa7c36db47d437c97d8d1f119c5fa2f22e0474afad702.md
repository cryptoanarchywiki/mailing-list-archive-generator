	In other words, if I say that there's something wrong with a culture
that doesn't encourage education (e.g., the "acting white" name-calling in
American lower-class black subcultures), the entire Cypherpunks list archives
would be banned by their standards by any parents who didn't want their
children seeing KKK literature? TCMay has also said things of that nature (and
I agree). This definition is way overly PC.
