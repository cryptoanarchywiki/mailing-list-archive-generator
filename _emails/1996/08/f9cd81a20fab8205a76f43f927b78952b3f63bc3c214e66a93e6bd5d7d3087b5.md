At current data rates (OC-48 Sonet) 32,256 voice channels per
fiber, 580,608 total for the fiber.

Off by a factor of roughly 36 at this point.

Off by a factor of at least 10 not counting switching equipment.

A good point, in Sri Lanka they were having problems with copper
bandits cutting down all the cable, till they switched to fiber.
The question is can the average citizen of china afford a cell
phone and service for what it can be installed.

Who's using who is a matter of perspective. 

Q) if you call a dog's tail a "leg" how many legs does a dog have?

A) four, calling a tail a leg doesn't make it one.

Point? The LD companies pay to use the RBOC's networks, calling it
a subsidy doesn't make it one, except maybe to you. If they don't
like it, they are free (or soon will be) to build their own, or use
someone elses.

"Presumably be entitled?" The RBOC's currently charge what
regulations allow, if the regs go away, they will charge what the
market will pay.

Enhance your calm Jim......

The rate has gone down since the regs are changing and competition
is increasing. I would be interested in hearing why you think it
will ever drop to zero.

 <sigh> Jim, first you set up the ISDN "Strawman" and then you
knock it down. I no more believe that ISDN is the future than you
do.

Be well!
