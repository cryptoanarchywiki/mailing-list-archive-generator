fellow 'punks,

An artist named Zoltán Szegedy-Maszák is doing some interesting work for an
organiztion named "C3" (the "3" is a superscript and it's pronounced
"see-cubed") in Budapest, Hungary. C3 is an arts/culture/net.communication
organization funded by the Soros Foundation, SGI and Matav (the Hungarian
telephone company). They have a nice little Silicon Lab with an Onyx and a
few Indy's, PC and Macs, and Zoltan has a page up on one of the Indy that
demonstrates his "Cryptogram" generator:

   <http://lucida.c3.hu/cryptogram/>

This project takes ASCII text strings and converts them into 3D models by
assigning vertex coordinate values based on the ASCII codes encrypted by
what I'll call a "key model." Essentially, it's a simple 3D steganography
engine. It's rather intriguiging from a cryptographic perspective (pun
intended). Zoltan sees it as a way of transferring .wrl fies among VRML
afficionados, but also as a way of embedding messages. Definitely worth a
peek: try your own name in VRML, light sources and all. :)

Also check out C3's main site at: <http://www.c3.hu/>.
