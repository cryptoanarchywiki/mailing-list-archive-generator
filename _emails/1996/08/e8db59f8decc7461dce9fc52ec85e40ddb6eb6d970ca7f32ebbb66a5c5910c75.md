  In the future please send all messages of the form ~something is
wrong with the list~ to owner-cypherpunks@toad.com and NOT the list
its self.  We already have enough off topic and puerile traffic
cluttering up the list.
  If you think you see a _very_ major problem then please do email me
directly.
  Now please get back to building the better world we sometimes still
talk about building...
