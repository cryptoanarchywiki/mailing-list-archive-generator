When Clinton closed Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic, he cited
the
private plane that crased on the South Lawn as one of the reasons for
the
tighter security.  But closing the road north of the White House would
surely
not have kept an airplane at bay.

If the Feinstein amendment passes (outlawing "bomb-making information"),
will
the Congressional Record be censored?  Will Joe Biden be held
accountable for
making the material available?
