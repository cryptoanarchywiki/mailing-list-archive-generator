"Explode"?

Is this one of those southern cracker beer bombs?

Let's see...circumstantially, we've got:

- a southerner

- a truck

- an explosion

I'd say that if Jim is either overweight or has ever fired a gun, we've got
an arrest before dawn. But we've got to hurry--NBC wants Katie Couric
present at the bust.

Buy a section of metal water pipe 1/2 by 6 inches long, threaded on both
ends.  Buy two metal caps to fit.  These are standard items in hardware
stores.  Drill a 1/16th hole in the center of the pipe. This is easy with a
good drill bit. Hanson is a good brand to use.  Screw a metal cap tightly
on one end. Fill the pipe to within 1/2 inch of the top with black powder.
Do not pack
the powder. Don't even tap the bottom of the pipe to make it settle.  You want
the powder loose.  For maximum explosive effect, you need dry, fine powder
sitting loose in a very rigid container.
