   8-10-96, NYP: 
 
   Peter Steinfels, religion columnist, compares the 
   "religious right" with the "life-style left," and examines 
   how the perjoratives are employed to oversimplify and 
   stigmatize -- an example of the pitfall A. Mehta has 
   critiqued on Cypherpunks: "binary thinking." 
 
      The real opposite number to the religious right is the 
      life-style left, which includes people who are religious 
      and people who are not. It includes some welfare-state 
      liberals and some anti-government libertarians. 
 
      What unites the life-style left is the belief that In 
      regard to the widest possible range of basic choices 
      about how to live, the state should refrain from 
      exerting its influence. The more basic the question, the 
      less the role of the state.
