Or, who knows. NASA could finally wake up, really that the shuttle sucks
as a cargo hauler, start using something like the Phoenix (They
stonewalled it - would have made them look bad) to build orbital industry
and then setup giant solar-powered launch lasers and have surface to
orbit at pennies per pound.  Oh well...  Who'd have thought we'd go to
the moon and stop.
