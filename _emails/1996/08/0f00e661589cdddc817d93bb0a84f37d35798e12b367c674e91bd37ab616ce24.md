Space:
How often does your system crash? (Imagine sending a shuttle up there to 
troubleshoot the server)

Sea:
If your server swims in the ocean I could think of several drawbacks:
- - per satellite only: costs
- - must be very robust (salt water, shocks)
- - must be powered by battery (Hey Jeff, have you ordered the 2000 Alkaline
  batteries yet, I think it's about time to change them on the server)
- - everybody can go and get it (after all, no jurisdiction also means no
  protection - I believe that everybody can claim stuff floating in
  international waters, he just has to get it).

But I like the idea anyway.
But then again, why don't you just buy an island and get the country to 
grant you jurisdictional power over it?

(sounds a lot cheaper than a satellite)
