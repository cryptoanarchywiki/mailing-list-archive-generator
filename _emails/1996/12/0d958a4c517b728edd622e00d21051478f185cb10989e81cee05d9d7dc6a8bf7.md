This was, of course, my point about there being no universally valid truth,
and what such anti-fraud statutes must mean about religions.

Basically, "free speech" entails a kind of anarchy (= no law) with regard
to truths and falsehoods. As I like to say, "at most, one religion is
correct" (with the other 783 major sects clearly spouting falsehoods...and
probably _all_ 784 major sects doing so).

If PICS codes are ever mandated, this will be placing the legal system and
governments in the business of deciding truth.

The meta-point I am making is not about truth and religion, but about this
business of insisting that people label their words by some criteria.
Speech should not require prior approval by a standards body, or
self-labelling.

(And, to repeat, any such labelling implies standards of truth that simply
don't exist.)
