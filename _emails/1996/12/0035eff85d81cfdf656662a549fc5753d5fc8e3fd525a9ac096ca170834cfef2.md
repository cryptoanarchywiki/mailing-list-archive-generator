The US Army's Field Manual on Basic Cryptanalysis (FM 34-40-2), dated
September 1990 is available for downloading as an Acrobat PDF file from:

http://www.atsc-army.org/cgi-win/$atdl.exe/fm/34-40-2/default.htm

Fairly classic in nature (substitution, transposition, and code systems).
Huge files (so far, at 28.8, after about an hour and a half, I've only been
able to grab the table of contents and a couple of appendices - some
kind-hearted person with a T1 or greater may want to get everything, then
zip and mirror to save us bandwidth challenged folks the pain).

Also, for the complete listings of almost 300 downloadable FMs through the
Army's
Digital Training Library (ATDL), check out:

http://www.atsc-army.org/cgi-win/$atdl.exe?type=fm&header=%2Fatdl%2Fbrowse%2
Ffm.htm

Have fun!

Joel

Note: This site isn't wholly reliable.  It seems to regularly go up and
down, and sometimes the bandwidth is terrible.  Probably worth your
patience though.
