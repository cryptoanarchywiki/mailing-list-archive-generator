Don't the ITARs say it's illegal to "disclose" that material to a foreign 
person?  If that's the case, then presumably a person could take the 
material out of the country without "disclosing it," or he could "disclose" 
it to that foreign person inside the US.    True, the government seems to 
have already taken the position that there is a personal-use exemption, but 
so far we haven't heard any action with regards to in-country disclosure to 
a foreigner.  I'm not trying to give them any nasty ideas, but a domestic 
sting with this as its nexus seems possible.
