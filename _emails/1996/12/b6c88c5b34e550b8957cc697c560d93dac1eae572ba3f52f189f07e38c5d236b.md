"Generalisation"? It's a historical fact that Armenians have murdered
2,500,000 Turks, Kurds, and Sephardic Jews in this century alone.

Next you'll say that Germans didn't kill 6 million Jews. (Of course, the
Nizkor project now claims that Germans killed 12 million Jews. Isn't
it remarkable how fast those pesky dead Jews can multiply? :-)

Interesting. Paul Bradley does not consider Timmy May's (fart) latest rants
on "ebonics" and "colored race" to be racist? I think Timmy May hates
blacks even more than he hates Jews. Let's quote Timmy's sick garbage on
soc.culture.african.american and ask if they find it offensive and racist.
