Perhaps random numbers would be stronger but they would not be manifestly
random.
MD5's formula for t_i precludes the possibility that the definer of MD5
chose the numbers
accoriding to some undisclosed principles that would allow him a trap door.

The following code computes the magic numbers without requiring trig functions:

static word si[64];
static int md5init()
{double c1=0.5403023058681397, s1 = 0.8414709848078965;
int j; double a=1, b=0;
for(j=0; j<64; ++j)
 {double p = a*c1 - b*s1, q = a*s1 + b*c1;
  a=p; b=q;
  {union{double d; struct{int high; int low;} fx;} z;
   z.d=(fabs(b)-1.1e-10)+1048576;
   si[j] = z.fx.low;
 }}}

An alternative would have been to let t_i be MD4(i) or SHA(i).

Using SHA to define MD5 would have required collusion between Rivest
and NSA to allow for a trap door. Even then it would have been very difficult.
