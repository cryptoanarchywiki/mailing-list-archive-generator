Wrong!  You must telnet to all.net, but the correct logname is
"getpgp" with no password.  It will ask you some questions (like are
you a US citizen), and then give you an export-controlled ftp
directory to go to.

As far as I know, however, PGP 5.0 is still in beta test, though you
can get a snapshot from there (in source form only).  They also have
source and binaries for the latest released version of PGP 3.

Does anyone know what happened to PGP 4, BTW?  Is that version number
just being skipped because it was used by Viacrypt or something?
