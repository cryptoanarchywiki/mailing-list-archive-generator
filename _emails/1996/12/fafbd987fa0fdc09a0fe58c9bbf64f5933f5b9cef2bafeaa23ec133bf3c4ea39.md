If the free market is a good thing, that it's a democratic way of
getting the best to the top of the economic ladder, then I see no
reason why this should not also apply to politics.

The people have every right to use democracy to establish a
non-democratic system re: abolishment of the wealthy as a class
and sentencing the entire Forbes 400 and their underlings to 25
years at forced labor, say 16 hour days at picking vegetables
under the pain of the knouted whip.

No Libertarian could oppose the use of the political free market
of democracy for undemocratic ends; that would violate the spirit
of liberty!
