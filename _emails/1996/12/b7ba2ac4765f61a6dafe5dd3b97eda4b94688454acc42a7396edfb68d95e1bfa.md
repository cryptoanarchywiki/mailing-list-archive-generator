I hardly want to be known as the champion of welfare, despite my recent
posts ;-( I wonder, however, if these figures are to some large extent a
result of health care benefits (presumedly) being paid for whereas
ordinary folk in the states do not get such access.

Assuming these figures are accurate, there does appear to be a problem!
While I do believe that most people would rather work than not, there
really should not be any financial incentive to chose welfare over
honest work. FWIW, I don't *believe* these figures are representative of
Canadian welfare roles as we all get (more or less) free health care to
begin with, something I and most Canadians are proud of.

(Once again, I am back on cypherpunks talking about non-crypt related
subjects. This is my last public posting on this subject.)

cheers, kinch
