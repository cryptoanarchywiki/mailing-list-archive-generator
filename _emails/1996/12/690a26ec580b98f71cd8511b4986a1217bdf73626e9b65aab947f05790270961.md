It happens to be the case that the Northern District of California
borders on the Pacific Ocean, and includes (at least) two airports
with direct flights to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions to the west.
I do not know if there are any satellite or oceanic cables similarly
situated, but I wouldn't be surprised.

Of course, the significance of this is between you and your lawyer.
