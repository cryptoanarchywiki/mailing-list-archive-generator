This is an announcment for an advanced cryptography course in the greater
Boston area:

Here comes the syllabus for the course EE 589R, Advanced Topics in
Cryptography and Data Security. The first class will be held on Monday,
January 20, at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

The course is a continuation of EE 578/CS 578, Cryptography and Data
Security. It will provide a deeper insight into several areas of cryptology
which are of great practical and theoretical importance. The three main
areas treated are: Detailed analysis and implementation of public key
algorithms, advanced protocols, and modern attacks against cryptographic
schemes. We will address many topics which are usually only treated in the
research literature.

Please feel free to get in touch with me any time if you have further
questions about the course.

Regards,

Christof Paar
