     That doesn't say anything about the quality of their work.

     Given your statements about Gilmore, can you provide any specifics
about individuals lack of competence in a given area?

     How is this "stealing"? The GNU license explicitly (IIRC) allows
this, and it doesn't take anything _away_ from the developer. I don't 
see how it is stealing.

     Where can I download MS VC++ (Microsoft, now there is a company with a 
marvelous reputation for sterling products.) for the cost of my Internet 
connection?

     I already use Linux, and I need to learn NT, so I would like to have 
a compiler, and I can't afford one. It would be nice to be able to learn
one compiler that works under both platforms. I don't do enough programming
to be able to justify MS VC++, and I don't have piles of cash hanging around
waiting for me to throw them at Satan.

     Fuck Shrinkwrapped software.
