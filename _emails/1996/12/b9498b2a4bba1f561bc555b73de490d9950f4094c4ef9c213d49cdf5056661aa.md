"Cybercash at risk/Money laws lacking"

  The laws that govern digital money are unclear, partly because 
  governments have failed to revise finance rules to include the online 
  realm explicitly. However, the feds want to be able to trace funds in 
  some way in order to guard against online money laundering. 
  Although no one wants interference from the government, some 
  clear statements from lawmakers might help.
