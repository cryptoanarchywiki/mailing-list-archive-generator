The Commerce Department draft crypto export regulations (see
http://www.steptoe.com/commerce.htm) include the following stipulation
on Key Recovery Agents:


    Evidence of an individual's suitability and trustworthiness [to
    act as a key recovery agent] shall include:

	(i) Information indicating that the individual(s):

	     (A) Has no criminal convictions of any kind or
	     pending criminal charges of any kind;

	     (B) Has not breached fiduciary
	     responsibilities (e.g., has not violated any
	     surety or performance bonds); and

	     (C) Has favorable results of a credit check;
	     or,

       (ii) Information that the individual(s) has an active
       U.S. government security clearance of Secret or higher
       issued or updated within the last five years.

It's nice to know that we can trust ex-cons, frauds, and deadbeats to
hold our keys, provided that they have obtained a Secret clearance.
