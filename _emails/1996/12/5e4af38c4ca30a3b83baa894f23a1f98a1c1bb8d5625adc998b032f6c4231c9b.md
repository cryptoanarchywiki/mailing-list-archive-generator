As follow-up of the recent discussion of RF detection,
we've put a 1995 article on data security in buildings at:

     http://jya.com/datasec.htm

It describes architectural measures to protect data beyond
that provided by encryption. We offered this article by E-mail 
in 1995. Ta-da: a request came from DOJ.

It cautions that the global snooping is booming, so what 
worked in 1995 may be Moscow-Embassy Potemkin: for
security hire an ex-KGB spookitect!
