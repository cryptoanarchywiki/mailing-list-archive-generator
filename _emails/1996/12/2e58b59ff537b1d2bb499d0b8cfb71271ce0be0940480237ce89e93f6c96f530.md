Your tcp/ip package should have a program called 'whois', which goes to
internic and searches its database. I'm not sure if MS includes it in NT or
whatever you're using... If you can't find it, just telnet to internic.net or
rs.internic.net port 43 (important!) and type the string you want to search
for. Save the output - it closes the telnet connection after sending it.
Yes, it relies on people supplying the information about themselves.
Some folks are pretty paranoid about. E.g., fingering unicorn@uiuc.edu says:

]----------------------------------------
]       name: You may not view this field.
] department: You may not view this field.
]      title: You may not view this field.
]      phone: You may not view this field.
]    address: You may not view this field.
]      other: You may not view this field.
]   email to: unicorn@uiuc.edu (Not present in entry.)
] public_key:
]You may not view this field.
]----------------------------------------

May not view the public key? Come on.
