   Actually the word is "niggus."  "Niggaz" is the white man's nasal rendition 
of this term.  It can alos be spelt "niggas," but this form implies a different context. 
context.  "Niggus" is used often within gangsta rap music in an effort to 
rhyme with difficult words when no other way can be found.  "Niggas" would be 
referring to other black fellows in a friendly way.  

   More or less.
