blanc:

        you know, the last time one of them fuzzy weird colored things, 
    you know, the kind which is always crawling around the edge of any 
    gathering with stick signs and chanting, ...well, the other day one 
    them things accidently crossed my sights, and my whole trigger hand 
    went into an involuntary spasm.  

        ...well, the judge he told me to take my medication and 
    dismissed the charges.  As I thanked the judge and reminded him of 
    the meeting tonight, I remembered the fuzzy little thing's last 
    words: "...Tax the Rich." 

        ...you know, that fuzzy little thing really looked like that 
    city slicker flatlander what up here last month --Dale or somethin' 
    like it! 

        I did not quite understand the significance of that, but I 
    thought to myself: 

            "oh, yeah, that's right: 'Nuke the Whales'."

        --just more words from attila
  ==
  "Expecting the world to treat you fairly 
    because you are a good person 
    is a little like expecting the bull 
    not to attack you because you are a vegetarian."

::Yeah, but you're obliged to partake one way or the other.

::this or that (when you take your head out of the sand momentarily), but like
::selfish little children, you cover your ears when the news is unpleasant,

::Maybe if you got off your ass and did something worthwhile for society,
::things would really change for the better.  But I won't hold my breath.
