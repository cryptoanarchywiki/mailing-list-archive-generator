These changes are all aimed at making it harder to make money from strong
crypto and therefore reduce its common availability worldwide. They do
little  to keep it from circulating worlwide, what ever its country of
origin as anonymous posting to a newsgroup is still straightforward.

Look for more shareware and commercial crypto source to circulate in
printed, rather than machine-readable, form to take advantage of freedom of
speech rules.
