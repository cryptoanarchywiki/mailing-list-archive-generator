You will not get objections from me either.  I would advise the banks to
make sure they accept all applicants and widely distribute the
announcement.  I would like them to make extra efforts to examine the
potential market in historically redlined areas.  I am not suggesting
forcing them to do so legislatively.  I never suggested a quota system.

My point is not that inputing all data you will get equivalence between
creditworthiness and racial makeup.  My point is that redlining exists and
I would favor the elimination of the practice.  Given a good program that
somehow magically gets to all potential debtors would have the result I
intend.  Not a quota system.  Equal access to capital.
