TOKYO, JAPAN, 1996 DEC 2 (NB) -- By Martyn Williams. Bank of America  
is due to offer its credit card customers the ability to perform 
basic account transactions via the Internet next year. The bank will 
be using a system currently under development by Hitachi Ltd. and Bank 
of America subsidiary Concorde Solutions, a Hitachi spokeswoman 
confirmed to Newsbytes today. 

"The new system will enable credit card transactions via the  
Internet," said Hitachi's Emi Takase. "Bank of America is aiming 
to market the system from August, 1997." 

Customers should be able to check credit card balances and account  
details, apply for credit limit increases, and many of the other 
actions that a telephone is currently used for. 

Concorde Solutions, a company 70 percent owned by Bank of America,  
will develop the application for users with Hitachi. It will run on 
top of the Japanese company's TP Broker system, an object request 
broker that was developed with Visigenic Software Inc. 

Launch customer for the system will be Concorde parent Bank of  
America, but plans are for the system to be marketed to other banks. 
"The product will be sold by both companies afterwards," said 
Takase.
