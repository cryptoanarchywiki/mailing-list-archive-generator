We've transcribed from PDF to ASCII the cryptanalysis 
program in Appendix F of the US Army's Field Manual 
FM 34-40-2, Basic Cryptanalysis, September, 1990.

   http://jya.com/appf.htm

Manual quote: "This program gives the capability to 
encipher and decipher messages in monoalphabetic and 
polyalphabetic substitution systems, produce a variety 
of statistical data about the encrypted messages, and 
print the results or save them to disk. Because of its 
limited purpose, the program does not support on-screen 
analysis. The printed results can be used off-line to 
aid in analysis, however. The program should be 
particularly useful in preparing examples and exercises 
for training cryptanalytic techniques."
