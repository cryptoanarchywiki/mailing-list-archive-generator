I agree generally to what Clay sets out below. However, the test cannot be
run apart from the other integral parts involved. Incidentally, try
running triplet, or even greater, autocorrelation of the 200 megabytes
set out at our web site. there is absolutely no problem. As indicated in
our statistics, we have already done that.
