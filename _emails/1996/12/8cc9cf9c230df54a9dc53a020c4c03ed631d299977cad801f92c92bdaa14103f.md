Actually I meant my tongue to be relatively firmly in cheek.  However, some
sub-cultures from which ebonics comes did have a need and desire to
communicate quickly and privately.

Often times in some areas of this country, people distrust the police.
They do form ways of communication that is not easily understood to avoid
what they see as police interference.  I am not defending use of
communication privacy techniques in the name of the four-horsemen but...

As Tim and others have said repeatedly, there is no on/off topic here.
Want pure code goto coderpunks; want moderation goto cryptography.  I am
just trying to counter some of the statements made here.  Sometimes people
view cpunks as some sort of borg-like mind with no dissidents.  I sometimes
reply to let people know that might not be so...
