Why is this so difficult?  The subject was legal tender, and I cited
two examples (real examples, no less) of controversy. I also asked for
relevant comments.  Is this comment supposed to be relevant?

To repeat: Certain credible sources have stated that pennies are not
necessarily legal tender in certain amounts, for ordinary transactions,
say, buying groceries.  The amount I heard was in the range of 25 cents
or thereabouts.  To my knowledge, this was not resolved, perhaps due to
the "spam attack".
