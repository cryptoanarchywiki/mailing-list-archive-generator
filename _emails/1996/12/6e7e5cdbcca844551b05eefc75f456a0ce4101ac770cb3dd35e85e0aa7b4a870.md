I did some more experiments with the IPG stream-cipher
algorithim and random number tests.  Since IPG claim that their
algorithim passes chi-square tests of randomness, I found
a chi-square test program.  It's written by Peter Boucher
and was posted to sci.crypt in '93 (<2bum8sINN98j@roche.csl.sri.com>).
I found it on the web site crypto.com, sorry I don't remember the
exact URL but I can send it on request. From the comments:

First I ran the output from my version of the IPG algorithim that I
posted a couple days ago :

% ./boucher < ipg.out
Occurances:  n =  12000000, V=-8375833.71
Character occurances non-random
Successions: n =     46875, V=62287.82
Character successions non-random


Then I ran output from a test RNG that's basically a loop around random():

% ./boucher < myrandom/out
Occurances:  n =   3414720, V=213050.62
Character occurances non-random
Successions: n =     13338, V=1143.41
Character successions non-random

As you'd expect, it doesn't look like the output from random() is all
that great.

Finally I generated some output from a random seed generator
I wrote a while back.  It gets randomness from high-resolution timers
and hashing system files.  It's not as fast as repeated calls to
rand() but is faster than reading from /dev/random:

% ./boucher < out
Occurances:  n =    594352, V=269.75
================ Frequency distribution excellent! ====================
Successions: n =      2321, V=256.12
================= Successor randomness excellent! =====================


So, from these tests it looks like IPGs PRNG, which their stream
cipher is based on, is not a very good source of random values.  Hence
anything encrypted with it is succeptable to cryptoanalysis.
How succeptable, I do not know.  I am sort of curious, since IPG claimed
that their PRNG produces "perfect" random data as measured by chi-square
analysis, yet my analysis shows otherwise.  Perhaps I have coded the
algorithim incorrectly (I don't think so, it's pretty simple).
Or perhaps IPG chose their keys for the ABC tables carefully to
produce good results.  Unfortunately that would mean that keys
would have to be carefully chosen, something that's not very practical.


Based on the work I've done, and the work Igor Chudov posted, it
looks like the IPG algorithim is probably not very strong.  If two
relative crypto neophytes can find serious problems with it, imagine
what might happen if experienced cryptoanalists look at it.  If you were
one of the people who said "it's snake oil unless it's been been
tested for a zillion years" etc. you can pat yourself on the back now
'cause you were right.

However I think that some of us owe Mr Wood, if not an apology for the
excessive abuse he got on this list, at least some respect for
putting his money where his mouth is and posting his algorithims.
Maybe he'll do some research, tone down the hype, and come back
with something better.
