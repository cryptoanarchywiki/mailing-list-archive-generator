Non-anonymous docs would choose virtual or real based on
travel/intimacy tradeoffs.  Urban general practicioners might see most
people in person, while rural docs and specialists would have more
virtual customers.  

Btw, how hard is it to have real-time digital mixes?  I imagine you
could learn a lot about virtual/real mappings from lots of "random"
communication lines failures.  Imagine all "leaf" lines into homes can
be broken on command from long-distance.

I think the question is whether 30% income tax evasion via crypto is
realistic given that the authorities aggressively try to prevent it.
Of course with lax enforcement evasion may be high, but as in your example
that has nothing to do with cryptography.

For some people, such as yourself, the cost of this may be small.  For
many other people I know, who socialize mostly with co-workers, the
cost would be very large.  The question is whether it is realistic to
think that 30% of workers would find this cost low enough to tolerate.

It would be hard to accept for me as well.  It would be a further
alienation of the workplace from what feels comfortable and natural.
Not only couldn't you show your face or voice, you might be afraid to
tell them new jokes you heard via your public persona, or recommend a
restaraunt or play you went to.

This scenario does seem possible for jobs where you do lots of very
similar tasks.  In this case a tester can just watch you do a dozen
random such tasks (assuming they can verify that you don't keep
repeating the test till you get a random result you like).  But for
most jobs, I think, the tasks are longer term, so that it is important
to see your actual performance over many years.  And even with small
jobs sometimes it is their ability to handle rare events that is most
important.

The question I pose is whether agressive enforcement can prevent this
30% evasion scenario.  If yes, the evasion is << 30%, so assuming
constant taxes is appropriate.

A very good point.
