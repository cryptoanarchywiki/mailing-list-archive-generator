The current address of the author of the Eudora plug-in is Damon Gallaty
<dgal@cad.gatech.edu>.  

I have been coorisponding with him on a couple of odd problems with the
software.  (Implemenation issues more than bugs.)  He has been very
responsive.  (In fact, I need to send him another bug report tonight about
failing to deal with line wrap in signatures.)

So far the set of plug-ins have been very useful.  I have been pretty happy
with it so far.  (It does have the problem of not word wrapping before
applying the PGP sig and defaulting to the last key if you do not set one
in config.txt.)

All in all, worth the download.
