>Hi all-
>
>	Finally got around to doing something I had meant to do. I have set
>up an HTML-ized version of the PGPfone Mailing List archives. It is
>reachable off the PGP Fone Registry, but the exact URL is :
>
>	http://pgp.rivertown.net/pgp-fone/archives
>
>Now any newcomers to the list will find it easier to catch up, or if you
>need to look something up, the archives are indexed by date, author,
>and subject/thread. Hope you find it useful. Until I figure out how to
>update it automatically over an NFS mounted system, I will manually update
>them at least once a week.
>
>	I'm sending this to PGP-Users too so anyone interested in the
>PGPfone list can get a taste of what is going on there. The PGPFone list is
>up to almost 100 subscribers and growing (tell your friends!!)
