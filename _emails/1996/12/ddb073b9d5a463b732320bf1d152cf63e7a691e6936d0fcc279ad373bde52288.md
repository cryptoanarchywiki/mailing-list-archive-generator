	I should have added quotes around "securely delete." The end of Peter
Gutmann's paper states "it is effectively impossible to sanitise storage
locations by simple overwriting them, no matter how many overwrite passes
are made or what data patterns are written. However by using the relatively
simple methods presented in this paper the task of an attacker can be made
significantly more difficult, if not prohibitively expensive." VGP tries to
make is prohibitively expensive (that is, in essence, what all ciphers do;
someone can break just about any cipher if they have enough money).
