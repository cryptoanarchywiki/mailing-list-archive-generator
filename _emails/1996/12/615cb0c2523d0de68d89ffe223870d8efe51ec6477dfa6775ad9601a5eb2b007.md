They can do whatever the hell they want. 

Whether it makes any difference to the store's bottom line is 
another question. What some places will do is call the card number
down to the credit offices, who will run an authorization (*not a
charge) for one dollar on that card number, figuring that if the
Visa/MC system won't even authorize a dollar, they'd better not
take the check. Personally, I don't think the process helps much.
It's all a part of Corporate Cover-Your-Own-Ass Culture. "Yes, the
check bounced, but we followed the procedures in the employee
manual!" "We're committed to taking definite steps to fight shrinkage!"

People on the list could probably come up with much better ways to
authenticate a reputation. Until then, for personal checks, you can
call any bank in the U.S., ask for bookkeeping, and ask them if there
are funds in the bank to cover the check you're holding. Any bank
should give you a yes or no on this. Some banks, like the First Banks
here in Minnesota, will do this through their automated telephone
banking services, 24 hours.

Now, for the rest of you who are calling for the government, of all
people, to protect your privacy, please......take that personal 
check, picture ID and MasterCard, go down to the after-Christmas
sales, and buy a clue.
