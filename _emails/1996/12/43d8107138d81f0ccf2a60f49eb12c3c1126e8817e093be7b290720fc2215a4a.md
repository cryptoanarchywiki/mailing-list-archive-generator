Good for you. I think Tim has largely overestimated the clue of the
average FAQ-reader. I've learned quite a bit from FAQs. Besides,
multiple distribution points for the same info are a Good Think, in
that they increase exposure, and use different language to express the
same things, thus allowing greater comprehension.

A few suggestions:
Pot the warning signs near the top. The technical intro is too brief
to be easily understandable by mosr MIS folks, and may scare them
away. I think a good organization for the document would be
1) Warning signs
2) The stuff about key sizes
3) The technical intro
4) everything else

Also, I saw no mention of source releases in the warning signs
section. Publishing your algorithm is good, but if there's a bug in
your random-number generator (Netscape?), you're screwed.

Examples of good and bad crypto. Stuffit and MSWord encryption is bad,
PGP is good, that sort of thing.

Anyway, I think it's a good resource.

Jer
