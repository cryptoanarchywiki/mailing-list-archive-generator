	I see... that explains your apparantly nonsensical answer that the
guarantees on student loans don't make any difference. Quite alright; we all
make mistakes.
	I would like to suggest that the essential problem in determining
loans to those who have just graduated is that of headaches in gathering
sufficient information; namely, the cost of finding out "is this a good
school" and "how good are this person's prospects" are sufficiently high so as
to make up for the default rates. As previously mentioned by Dale Thorn,
the inclusion in this figure of various trade schools is also a (related)
problem, one that Clinton's proposal of student loans for 2 years of
college for _everyone_ would make worse.
