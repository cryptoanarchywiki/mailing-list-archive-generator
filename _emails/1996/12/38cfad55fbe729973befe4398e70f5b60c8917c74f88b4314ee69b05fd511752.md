SCOOPS AND TOP STORIES


IBM PLAYS DOCTOR
Big Blue is developing an innovative Internet "immune system" that intends
to do battle with one of the Internet's nastiest hazards - viruses.

   http://www.news.com/News/Item/0%2C4%2C5829%2C00.html?nd


NET BOOM ELUDES MAIN STREET
We've all heard the seductive hum of the buzzwords: e-commerce, online
advertising, new economic paradigm, secure commerce. And yet, many of those
who actually put their sites where their mouths are seem to find one sound
to be conspicuously absent: the happy cha-ching of the digital cash register.

   http://www.news.com/News/Item/0%2C4%2C5824%2C00.html?nd


BATTLES WITH GATES...PRICING SNAFUS...HUGE QUARTERLY LOSS? NO PROBLEM FOR AOL!
A mere six weeks after a white-knuckled corporate bungee jump during which
its stock plummeted to the 22-3/8 mark--AOL's stock rose more than 13
percent in a single day. A major factor in this comeback is the "big news"
(300,000 subscribers' worth) expected to be announced at the firm's
semiannual partners' conference tomorrow.

   http://www.news.com/News/Item/0%2C4%2C5825%2C00.html?nd

DEC AND CARRERA TEAM UP TO CREATE 500-MHz WORKSTATIONS AND SERVERS
Aiming at Internet, scientific, and multimedia markets with their insatiable
appetites for processing power, the DEC/Carrera team can boast about
offering one of the fastest processors in the world. That is, until 1997,
when the race gets even faster.
