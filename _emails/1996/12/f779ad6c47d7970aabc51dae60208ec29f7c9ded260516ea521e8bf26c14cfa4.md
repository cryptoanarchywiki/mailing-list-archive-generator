According to knowledgeable sources,
Digicash b.v., the Dutch-based privately held
Internet payment company that was founded and
is chaired by Chaum, is in the market for a new
top executive.

The 6-year-old company plans to make
Chaum, the ponytailed inventor of Digicash's
innovative payment system, chief technology
officer and to hire a new CEO to run the
company.
