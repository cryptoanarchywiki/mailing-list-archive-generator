	Especially in the computer field, language is irrelevant; as long as
someone can "speak" C++ or HTML, they're fine.

	Yes, though your same discrimination rules apply to "White Trash." I want
to see if your language discrimination applies only to black Ebonics or to
the white Southern twang also.

	Not really. America is an incredibly diverse place. There are parts of the
country where correct English-speaking people are minorities; if you've
grown up in one of these places, you'll speak the native dialect no matter
how smart or stupid your are.

	Spoken language, which is what you're discriminating against is vastly
different from typed language. Everyone types pretty much the same way but
everyone speaks differently. People who speak in Ebonics or with a Southern
twang often know the rules of grammar, as expressed in writing, but they do
not speak "correctly" because they are not accustomed to doing so.

	What?! How can you say this? According to your position, it is my right to
flame you because, as a better grammarian and orthographer, I am more
intelligent than you and you should know this. In fact, your viewpoint can
be extrapolated to say that anyone who make a grammar or spelling mistake
in any message should be thrown off the list becuase they are not
intelligent.
