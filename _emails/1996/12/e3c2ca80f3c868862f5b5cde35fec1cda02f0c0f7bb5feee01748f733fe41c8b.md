OK, as you requested, you have been "unsubscirbed."

If you were looking to unscribe, unsuscrive, unsribe, or unsuscribe, I
can't help you.

Finally, if you were looking to unsubscribe, you should surely know by now
that members of the list cannot do this for you. The instructions have been
posted _many_ times just in the last few weeks, and follow again below.

--Tim May, Chief Unscriber and Unsuscurber
