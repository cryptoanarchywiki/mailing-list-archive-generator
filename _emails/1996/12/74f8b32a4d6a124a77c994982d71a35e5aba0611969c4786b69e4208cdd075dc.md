Whatever rational basis your arguments may have had were eradicated by the
ludicrous logical conclusion drawn above.

Oh so sad.  Let me make this clear, an accent is far different from
grammatically incorrect speech.  I can speak with grammatic perfection and a
drawl so heavy it'll make your eyeballs hurt.

(Of course, being from New Orleans, my normal accent is more like brooklyn
than Nashville -- four years in Mississippi changed all that)

And can still be spoken with proper grammar.   I make an exception for
foreign accents because we are dealing a completely separate language.
Speakers of ebonics are certainly not bilingual in this sense (and neither
am I).  I don't see hypocrisy at all.  I do see an apologist, pampering,
paternal point of view, however.  And we southern folk jes' don't abide that
sorta thang.

I wasn't "taught" a Southern accent.  I absorbed it in daily conversation.
I certainly wasn't taught a Southern dialect. I was taught the English
language.

I'll say it again...the notion that Ebonics exists as a separate language
-- not derived as slang from standard English -- is absurd.
