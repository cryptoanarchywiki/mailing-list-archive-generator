	And what institution ultimately requires the SSN and a considerable
number of these other pieces of information? What institution puts a
considerable number of roadblocks in the way of getting a post office box,
for use as a home address, without a "home address"?

	If you've got such responses, please give them. They may very well
be tedious; I'd disagree about them being non-productive, based on my
past experience. Without such responses from you to some very well-reasoned
arguments, we are left with the equivalent of the Feds on cryptography, i.e.,
"if you knew what we know you'd agree with us."
