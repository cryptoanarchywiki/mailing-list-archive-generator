Yes and no.  Depends on the objective. If I had to purchase and install
a new server for my employer, and not being an expert in security myself,
I would (barring having a very trusted friend for advice) certainly be
inclined to trust the published reports more than anecdotes, even when
the anecdotes come from erstwhile reputable posters on these lists.

OTOH, if I were about to hire an employee to do that very job (and other
similar jobs as time goes on), I would be much more inclined to trust my
instincts, my perceptions during the interview(s), and specific data
handcarried in by the prospective hiree than any published statistics
or recommendations in hiring methodology that are generally used in
large-corporation hiring.

Perhaps even this last paragraph wouldn't apply if I were a large-corpor-
ation personnel recruiter, since in that case I'd not only be further
removed from the IS dept., but I'd be representing people with agendas
that aren't necessarily similar to what I deal with in the small company
I work in now.
