The NYT reports today on the administration's new
national security team and the formulation of policy
to focus on international crime as a national security
threat.

Cited are thriving Russian black marketers selling hardware,
software, and skills developed by the USSR; high-technology 
which has speeded communication and dissolved national 
borders; the diffusion of many enemies rather than a single
superpower.

The nature of crime has changed. No longer limited to drugs,
terrorism and flight from justice, now there's money
laundering, kidnapping, smuggling, credit card scams, even
auto theft.

It describes measures to combat this threat to all nations by 
cooperating and competing foreign affairs, intelligence and 
law-enforcement agencies around the world. None so trusting 
of each other.

Some fund- and purpose-scrambling agencies klaxon that 
international crime is now as grave as nuclear proliferation
and ethnic conflict. The three threats may merge, and new 
nations are at greatest peril.

Which supports the administration's bulldogged clamp on 
crypto export limits: if we knew what they knew about
rogue, ex-officials arranging their future with successors
inside -- they need to communicate in private.

What crypto will Perry, Deutch and consorts use to keep
secrets among the few who know what we don't -- yet? 

Cryptanalysts, dissolve borders set by secret pacts.
