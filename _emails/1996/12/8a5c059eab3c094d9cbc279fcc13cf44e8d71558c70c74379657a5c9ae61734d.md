Software that is imported becomes subject to ITAR with respect to
re-exportation, of course (but of course IANALetc.)  

If you can't demonstrate to MSFT that you are
playing by the rules --such that you have the proper export papers
for your code if you plan to export it, for example-- they won't sign,
even if developed outside US.

So: you develop a CSP outside US ... you have to IMPORT it to get it signed.
It becomes subject at that point to ITAR export regs.  Unless you demonstrate
that you fulfull those requirements, no signature.  So there's no relief by
looking at just exporting the signature.
