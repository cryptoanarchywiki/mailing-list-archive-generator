Bzzt, wrong answer, thanks for playing.  "Reporting" here doesn't mean
"report the income to the IRS on your tax return."  It refers to the report
the bank is required to file by law on every transaction in excess of
$10,000.  If the guy didn't report the $27K as gambling winnings on his
1040 then he'd be guilty of tax evasion in addition to the structuring
charges, but that's an independent issue.  Go read 31 U.S.C. 5324
(http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/).

Of course he attempted to evade: three checks, deposits the first in bank
1, the second in bank 2, and the third in bank 1 again.  Trying to not
cause either bank to file the form that says "we just got a deposit in
excess of $10K."  That's structuring to evade.  Welcome to Allenwood.
