I suppose one of the myriad reasons it would have been difficult/impossible 
to prosecute Zimmermann is that, because the "crime" was approaching the end 
of the statute of limitations, the prospect existed that sometime during the 
trial, we could have had a "Perry Mason"-type ending, with somebody else 
standing up and claiming credit for the (then past the limit) act of 
uploading PGP.  If the standard used for conviction was "beyond a reasonable 
doubt," it would be just about impossible to convict unless the gov't had 
some sort of person-specific evidence, rather than merely evidence that PGP 
got onto the web.
