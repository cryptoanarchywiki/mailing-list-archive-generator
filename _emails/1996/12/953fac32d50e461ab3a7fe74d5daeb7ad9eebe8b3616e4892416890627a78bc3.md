On the contrary, in a world of anonymous payments and nyms, there is a
significant value for connecting nyms and true names and, hence a thriving
market in any information that might lead to a connection.

Bounty hunters maintain an ongoing lifestyle analysis on every true person.
Hot lists of people whose visible consumption and reported work don't jive
circulate widely. Ann can't walk down the street in a new pair of shoes
without 5 people sending in an mpeg to claim the micro-payment. And she
lives in terror as she watches the offer price for info about her rise.

By the way, as a covert MD with a receptionist cover, whom does she date?
