R3 ANNOUNCES SSL HTTP SOLUTION PROVIDING STRONG CRYPTOGRAPHY

Aathal, Switzerland, December 12, 1996 - r3 security engineering ag
announces
"r3 SSL HTTP Client"  which provides strong cryptography to any browser
which supports HTTP proxies. The product available on Win95/NT and
Win3.1 is in final Beta state and will be available on these
platforms by the end of this year. A beta version of "r3 SSL HTTP Client"

can be downloaded from  http://www.r3.ch/products/ssl/


The "r3 SSL HTTP Client" has been selected by the major Swiss Banks to
enable their homebanking applications with their customers. The solution
provides strong cryptography based on the 128 bit IDEA algorithm. Export
security and smaller key lengths were ruled out as inacceptable for
sensitive Internet homebanking services.

Strong cryptography with 128 bit IDEA algorithm is a
must for their homebanking Internet services.


The "r3 SSL HTTP Client" is part of a suite of SSL products
developed by r3 security engineering which consists of

_ r3 SSL HTTP Server
_ r3 SSL HTTP Proxy Server
_ r3 SSL HTTP Gateway
_ r3 SSL FTP Server
_ r3 SSL FTP Gateway

The r3 SSL server products will be available during the first quarter 97.

r3 security engineering ag - located in Aathal/Zurich, Switzerland -
is one of the major providers for security solutions in the area of
EDIFACT and Internet applications. r3's activities in international
standardization committees and in research projects guarantee state
of the art products and solutions.

"r3 SSL HTTP Server" and "r3 SSL HTTP Client" are trademarks of r3.

r3 SSL products use software modules developed by Eric Young
(eay@mincom.oz.au). Eric Young's SSLeay is used but the SSL layer
has been completely reengineered to provide full control over the SSL
handshake.
