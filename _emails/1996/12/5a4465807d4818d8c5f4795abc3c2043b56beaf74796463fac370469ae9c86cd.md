In law, there's a concept known as "mens rea," or "guilty mind."  (A Real 
Lawyer (tm) should be able to explain this to CP)    Presumably, if the 
legal system followed its own rules, it would be impossible to have a 
"guilty mind" about exporting crypto subsequent to the Patel ruling, until 
such time as that ruling was specifically overturned.  After all, the lay 
public is not expected to be experts here, and if a judge (!) says that 
crypto export regulations are a violation of the US Constitution, we should 
be entitled to believe her and to believe that we're entitled to disobey the 
(unconstitutional) law with a clear conscience.

Further, IMO, It shouldn't even matter if contrary legal decisions exist, as long as 
they are not directly above that court so as to overrule Judge Patel. Our 
consciences can still be clear:  If courts can't, themselves, agree, 
presumably we aren't obligated to second-guess which one is correct and 
which one is not.

However, a REAL LAWYER would also have to tell you that the system doesn't 
obey its own rules!
