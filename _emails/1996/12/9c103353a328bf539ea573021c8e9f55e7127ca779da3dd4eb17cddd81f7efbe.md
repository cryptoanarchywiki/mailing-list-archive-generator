To prevent ActiveX controls from formatting your hard drive while still 
being able to run native code to do fast DES cracking, why else?  
Sandbox!=Virtual CPU emulator.  Sandboxes work at the supervisor/user CPU 
level deciding which calls are cool and which will result in a core dump.

Viruses can sneak into software.  Given enough time you will see them 
sneak into compilers which will then happily create virus infected or 
trojan loaded controls which will be happily signed.  I'll leave the test 
of that scenario up to your imagination.  There were cases of viruses 
making their way to production distributed disks back a few years ago 
because people weren't watching carefully enough.

Or you may find that shareware control authors won't bother to sign their
controls, etc...  Same situation.  At some point trust or no trust, once
your hard drive is wiped, so is the record of the signature that says "The
last control you downloaded came from XYZ.com and was written by Vulis."

Right, so if that's the case, why would you allow ActiveX controls to run 
on your system?  It's the same problem whether signed or not as 
signatures only tell you the author's identity and not much else.
