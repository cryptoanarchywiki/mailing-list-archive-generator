"New encryption export rules probably won't be issued until early 
next week" 

   Rules probably won't be issued until just a day or 2 before they 
   go into effect on January 1, officials said Monday. Greg Simon 
   said section of rules requiring detailed business plans from 
   encryption companies is likely to be changed.

   [Markoff wrote last week the rules were due out December 22;
   any sightings?]
