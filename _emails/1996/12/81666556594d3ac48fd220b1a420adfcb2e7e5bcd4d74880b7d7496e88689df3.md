My original response was really just meant as humor.  (The other
paragraph in particular.)  I'm of the school that ratings are a 
profoundly useless idea for their supposed purpose, and dangerous
in their possible misuse by the government.

If a user randomly deletes parts of an application and it stops 
working I'm afraid the fault is entirely with the user.  Reinstalling
the damaged software would seem the obvious answer.

That article say in part, "Microsoft has indicated that future 
generations may well come out of the box with RSAC-i, by 
default, activated."  I follow Microsoft's strategy and 
announcements very closely and as far as I can tell this is
sheer fabrication.  The closest thing they've announced (and
shipped) is the IE Admin Kit that lets a corporation build
a custom version of IE with the settings to their liking.  I can't
find any fault with that.
