Sys Admin magazine (mainly Unix, but with traces
of NT integration creeping in) calls for papers
in each issue on subjects chosen by the editors.

I am sure there are people on this list capable of
writing much of the June 1997 issue, and taking
this opportunity to educate on the benfits of crypto.



This is an extract from the Jan 1997 issue, page 91.


We suggest that if you are interested in contributing,
you first submit a proposal to us.  If the proposal
seems appropriate, we'll ask you to submit a manuscript.
If the manuscript is accepted, we'll edit it, print it,
and pay you for it.  For more detailed information,
request a copy of our Author Guidelines (we can fax,
email or mail them to you).  Please address requests for
guidelines, proposals, and manuscripts to:

Amber Ankerholz
   saletter@rdpub.com
or
   saletter@mfi.com
