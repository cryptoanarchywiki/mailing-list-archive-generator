My point was that both programs use IDEA, so you couldn't characterize on as
weaker than the other one.  Weak algorithms are an option, but that doesn't
make the program any weaker.

Nearly every algorithm has some weak keys.  One out of every 2^96 IDEA keys
are weak.  If this is considered a security flaw, then every algorithm with
a keyspace of less than 96 bits is a "security flaw" because someone could
pick the correct key on the first try.  Besides, it's easy to prevent weak keys
from being chosen, even though it obviously isn't necessary.

That doesn't mean it shouldn't be an option.  I encrypt my files with different
passphrases, so RC4 wouldn't be a problem in a case like that.
