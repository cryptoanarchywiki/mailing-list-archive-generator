Somebody knows, but they're not gonna tell.  The good news is, they don't
send much of anything to the list, except every now and then when someone
presses one of their buttons.

It's interesting that men, whether they are gay or otherwise, share a
lot of things in common.  Actually, I've always thought that most
heterosexual men don't really like women all that much, beyond having
someone to dominate and use sexually.  I know I could get yelled at for
saying that, but if straight men *really* liked women, they'd show more
empathy and understanding toward them.  I'm into music a lot (indie-pop),
and most men I know wouldn't even consider listening to most girl-groups.
Wouldn't it be a nicer world if, when you see a lot of these guys
cruising down the street in their car with the radio booming out some
male-oriented rap song, if every now and then they'd mix in some
female artists?
