The focus for the current PnC offering is more privacy than security.  To 
avoid any issues of ITAR and export we chose to make the first version 
weak.  There will be future offerings that use stronger, non-exportable 
crypto.

As for the posting, I have seen the occasional commercial post float 
through.  This will be the only time that the post will show up on 
Cypherpunks.

Now if we can keep any long threads from getting kicked off (an all too 
common occurrence).  Perhaps replies could be taken to e-mail...

It seems to me that anything that's exportable is pretty damn useless, if
you really want to keep something secret.  Also... I kinda got the
impression that this list wasn't for silly commercial traffic?
