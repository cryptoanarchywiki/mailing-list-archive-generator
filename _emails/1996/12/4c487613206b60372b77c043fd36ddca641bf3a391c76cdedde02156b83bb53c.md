Got a bit of an update for everyone who was interested in the utility
of the Snake Oil FAQ. Tim May raised the issue that it seems likely
that a usenet FAQ will only reach people sufficiently clued to look
for a usenet FAQ, which probably means they're clued enough to already
know what's in the FAQ. I myself had this concern, but went ahead
taking everyone's input and working on it anyway.

I received at least a half dozen requests from folks wanting to
include it in internal memorandums, reference it in other
(nontechnical) works about Internet and security issues, etc.

It would seem that the message is getting out (admittedly slowly,
perhaps at the rate of two a month), but I suspect that as more
attention is brought to it, we'll continue to reach more people who
need to see it.
