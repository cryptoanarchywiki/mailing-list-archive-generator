Ever wonder whether the airport counter people know a valid ID from a
phoney (or a Law Enforcement ID for that matter)?  Take my word for it,
they don't.  Just scan your current ID, change the name/address fields
output on your handy-dandy dye-sublimation printer and laminate with a kit
from Price-Costco.  If you pay for your ticket in cash be prepared for a
search of your carry-on luggage.
