According to my contact in the ticket office it is NOT illegal to re-sell
tickets, even if you are selling them ABOVE face value.  San Jose Box office
makes a legal business out of this practice.

It is only illegal to sell them within a certain proximity of the venue.
You must have been within the "no vending zone"  if you were outside
of the zone, you should be able to get the charges dismissed.
