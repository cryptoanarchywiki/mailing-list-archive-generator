Which is what I've been saying; except for the impersonation feechur, you 
can do all of the above with a secure account.

That's funny, I could have sworn that services could log in as users.  
Gee I must have been dreaming all along about the directory replicator 
which requires you to create a replicator user, and the scheduler service 
which though it can run as the LocalSystem account is better executed as 
another user with limited rights.  No, I must have been imagining them. 
And the services control pannel which allows you to set such settings, 
I've imagined that too. 

Gee I also must have imagined hearing that it's a bad idea to allow such 
services such as the scheduler to log in as administrator or LocalSystem 
account because then folks could run anything they like by using the AT 
command with the /INTERACTIVE switch.

Sure there is no sandbox, however you can easily install the RunAsService 
program from the ResKit and point it at MIE so it too runs as a limited 
access account which won't have access to the rest of your hard drives, 
but granted, if someone does use the Impersonate calls in the control, 
this isn't going to help much.

Welp, there you go.
