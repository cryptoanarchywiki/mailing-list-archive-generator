Even with a custom client, I suppose there's always a chance 
of pulling things out of RAM.

How about a slightly different question:

Is there a way to sign it such that it wouldn't work if the
signature was removed, so there would be no question 
of who created it?

I suppose this is analogous to: Is there a way to sign
plaintext such that the plaintext can't be seen without the
signature attached?  I suppose not..

Is there a way to embed the signature as part of the 
code so it can't be removed?

Well, its concievable to write your own client, and make the code such
that it only works with that client...  I know, it kindof sucks, doesn't
it?
