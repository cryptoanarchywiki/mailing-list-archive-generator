Are you talking about the School Board requirements?  Are you still in High
School, Tim? ;-)  I have never heard you speak of children, so you might
have a valid complaint if you have them in public schools (although home
schooling is still an option).

[Tim's Critique of currently failing attempts at social justice elided]

I realize you dont agree with the tactics of some black leaders in this
country, but I dont understand why you have this need to cloak your
arguments in such antagonizing language.  You, of course, are free to do
so, I just find it counter-productive albeit sometimes humourous.
