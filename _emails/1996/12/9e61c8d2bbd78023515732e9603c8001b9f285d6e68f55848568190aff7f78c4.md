What you're talking about is contempt of congress.  This is not "fraud."

The penality imposed would be purjury.  I don't believe that during that

purjury is purjury, but it hardly rises to the level of conspiracy your
post originally indicated.

"I had no idea what I was talking about, but as luck would have it I was
right anyhow."
