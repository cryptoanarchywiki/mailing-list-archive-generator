If only B is required to be a prime, that is incorrect. See below.

Thanks for your response, Don. I appreciate that we are able to talk 
about cryptography because it is interesting.

Re: triplets. It seems that even if only one number in each triplet (B
or C) must be prime, as you said, we are still not guaranteed that the
PRNG will be "good".  For example, suppose that B is a prime around,
say, 10000, and C is 2*B.  In this case, the problem would still be the
same.

I agree that since lookup tables are used, the output for the XOR
engine would be more obscure than if the output of the PRNG was used
directly. This obscurity, however, does not imply that the resulting
XOR key data would be free of biases that I described.

There is a possibility that the biases could be exploited.

Take the extreme case: suppose that by an extreme stroke of bad luck
the output of your PRNG is only 11252 and 1. This may happen if B=11251
and C=11251*2 (I am too lazy to check if 11251 is a prime, but you get 
the idea) for all triplets, and all A=1. Would the three tables DIFF, etc.
be able to "randomise" the output? I doubt that, although can't say for
sure right now.

As for the code, I can sign the NDA *if* it is reasonable, but I can
only read your code if it is written and commented well. The problem is,
suppose I read your code and find a weakness. What do I do next since my
NDA forbids me from quotinbg relevant parts of the code?

Again, I am far from a professional cryptographer and would not be
able to do even a half-decent review. The comments that I make are
my attempt to find weaknesses in your algorithm.

I suggest that you hire a professional cryptographer with an academic
degree and ask him/her/it to produce an independent evaluation. It will
be worth more than my comments.

	- Igor.
