Remember Mykotronx, makers of the Clipper Chip?  Apparently, they were
bought in 1995 by Rainbow Technologies, http://www.rnbo.com/, who make 
dongles and crypto accelerator boards.  Some quotes from their web page:

http://www.rnbo.com/mykoweb/geninfo.htm
        Headquarted in Torrance, California, Mykotronx employs approximately
        110 people. The company was founded in 1979 as Myko Enterprises; 
        it incorporated and became Mykotronx, Inc. in 1987. 
        In 1995, Mykotronx became a part of Rainbow Technologies Inc. 
        (NASDAQ: RNBO), a world leader for intellectual property protection. 
....
        Anticipating higher production volumes, in October 1995, 
        Mykotronx opened a new facility that has dramatically enhanced its
        capacity for testing and programming cryptographic microprocessors. 
        The facility expands annual programming and test capability to more 
        than 1.2 million devices, with potential expansion to 5 million
units.
