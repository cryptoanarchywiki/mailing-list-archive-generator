Back in the Olden Days, we used to use these signals as sound output for
our computers. For example, on my Sol 20 computer (bought and soldered
together in 1978, in case anyone's interested).

There were various BASIC programs that ran various loops, thus generating
crude tones on nearby radios. And the games that were available had
routines which used radios as crude sound devices.

(None of which could hold a candle to my 1968 "amateur transmitters": neon
sign transformers, sending Morse code to my friend a mile or so away...it
was detectable on all AM bands! I never got a visit from the FCC, but I
only "transmitted" a few times.)

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
