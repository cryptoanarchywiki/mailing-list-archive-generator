All of this is valid (for argument's sake) except "the stupidity of
little Jessica".  She was doing well for a 7-year-old, and I was
quite proud of her. The morons who were flying that plane near weight
capacity at lower altitudes should have been shot for that alone, never
mind trying that at the altitude where they "bought the farm".

What happened to Jessica because of the selfish, greedy adults who were
involved actually gives weight to the parental licensing plan, yes?
(Ouch)
