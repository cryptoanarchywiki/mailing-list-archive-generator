I believe the first site to carry PGP 1.0 was Adelante BBS in Colorado where
Phil was living at the time. I was a user of that site when 1.0 was put
online and made publicaly available. I still have the Amiga disk those files
were d/l'ed on.

Somebody should ask Phil if he put v1.0 on any sites prior to Adelante.
