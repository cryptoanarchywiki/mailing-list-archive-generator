If they have not already done so, those currently doing work for/with C2
can form an off-shore company to manage and develop the crypto work.  This
off-shore company can then sell shares (private/public) to citizens and
companies (both foreign and domestic) and use the proceeds to develop the
software.  Some of the investors (e.g., C2) could be offered the
opportunity to become distributors and support the products in their
respective countries.

I doubt the Executive order can be interpreted to mean U.S. citizens cannot
purchase stocks of foreign companies engaged in crypto.  There are many
companies (e.g., NEC, Siemans, Philips, ect.) which engage in development
of crypto equipment which would not be exportable if they were produced in
the U.S.  Can the gov't deny us the right to invest in these and other
offshore companies?

Since those working for C2 are already doing so offshore (e.g., Australia
and England, I believe) these parties would only need to separately
incorporate an entity to conduct that portion of their current business now
under contract to C2.
