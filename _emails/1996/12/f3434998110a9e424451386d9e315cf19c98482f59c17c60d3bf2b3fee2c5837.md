 "Global Debate Over Treaties On Copyright"

 Given the overwhelming domestic objections to most of the
 treaty proposals, the obvious questions are: Who does
 support them? And why is the United States pushing so hard
 for them in Geneva?

 In fact, the main beneficiaries of the new copyright rules
 are the highest-stake copyright holders: rich, politically
 powerful entertainment and media conglomerates, which fear
 that pirated material will destroy the lucrative
 international market for products that can be digitally
 copied and distributed globally.

 In the digital world, computer software companies are
 already effectively using various data encryption
 technologies to protect their products for distribution
 over the network. And if progress to date is any
 indication, these technologies will become even more
 sophisticated and effective over time.
