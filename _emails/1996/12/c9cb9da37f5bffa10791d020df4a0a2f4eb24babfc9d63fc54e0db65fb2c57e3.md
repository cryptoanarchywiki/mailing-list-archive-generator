 "High-Tech Leaders to Facilitate Recovery of Encrypted
 Information Globally. Key Recovery Alliance Welcomes 29 
 New Members"

 The key recovery alliance has more than tripled its membership 
 and identified its charter objectives.

 + expediting the widespread, global use of strong encryption 

 + evaluating technologies that are flexible and scaleable to meet
 various changing commercial needs and policies 

 + promoting interoperability between different key recovery and 
 non-key recovery solutions 

 + defining a commercial infrastructure for worldwide development 
 of strong encryption 

 + maximizing security for business

 To facilitate meeting these and other objectives, the alliance
 identified a series of working committees targeted to meet within
 the next 60 days. Soon after this 60-day period, the now
 40-member alliance will re-convene to mark the progress of these
 committees and to identify future benchmarks and deliverables.

 The new members of the alliance are: America Online, Inc.,
 Certicom, Compaq Computer Corporation, CygnaCom Solutions,
 Inc., Cylink Corporation, Data Securities International, Inc., 
 First Data Corporation, Digital Signature Trust Company, Gradient
 Technologies, Inc., ICL, McAfee, Mitsubishi Corporation of
 Japan, Motorola, Mytec Technologies, Inc., Network Systems
 Group of StorageTek, Nortel, Novell, Inc., PSA, Price
 Waterhouse, Racal Data Group, Rainbow Technologies, SafeNet
 Trusted Services Corporation, Secure Computing, SourceFile,
 Sterling Commerce, Telequip, Unisys, Utimaco Mergent, and
 VPNet Technologies.


 "IBM SecureWay Framework To Accelerate Growth of Electronic
 Business"

 IBM announced a new framework which will advance secure 
 electronic business by making it possible for diverse security 
 offerings to work together. The IBM SecureWay Key Management 
 Framework will let businesses use encryption products 
 interchangeably.

 The new framework will provide for the easy adoption of new
 and existing key recovery technologies, while not disturbing
 existing cryptographic and other security functions and
 operations. It will effectively isolate the application from the
 unique properties of a specific key recovery implementation.

 A white paper describing the SecureWay Key Management
 Framework is available at http://www.ibm.com/security
