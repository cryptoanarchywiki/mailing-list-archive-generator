Thanks for the reply.  My experience with Firefly #1 has shown that the
people who would most need the service (or need it at all) are the least
likely to benefit from it, which is why I think it's a bad thing, wasting
a lot of valuable time hand-entering data, only to find it doesn't
correlate the more interesting (non-mainstream) data.

I'll try the website service, but my up-front instinct is that it won't
be much better unless the software is a *whole lot* better.
