In a message dated 96-12-20 17:23:29 EST, you write:

<< Anyone have the current black-letter regulations? I'll have some time
 to kill over the holidays that might as well be used for civil 
 disobedience. What's likely to happen to me if I refuse to show ID? 
 Provide invalid ID, don't get caught, then publicize the fact? Provide 
 invalid ID and get caught? Or, better:
 
 "My wallet was stolen. The only ID I have on me is my ACLU membership 
 card and my PGP key. Can I still get on the plane?" >>

Well, something of the sort happened to me...
I didn't have my ID on me. (Delta airlines..) and they _WOULD_NOT_ let me on
the plane without the proper ID. I actually had lost my ID shortly before...
Then... A different time at the airport.. American airlines told me that If I
didn't have ID.. Id still be let on... just that the way they process my
baggage would be different ( I imagine they would physically look through
it...
