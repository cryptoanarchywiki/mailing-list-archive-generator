This is the message I got in response to my post regarding Mr. May's
offensive, racist, and bigoted post about ebonics.  I have made
overtures towards peace and tried to explain that I thought that the
Doctor's verbal slapping was not as bad as it seemed, maybe even he
deserved it!.  He refuses to answer.  He's just a pussy, I guess. 
Like's to make terroristic threats.  To Nam vets, yet.  Ballsy, Tim!

Maybe the Doctor is not to far from wrong.

I would rather have discussed this with you in private e-mail, or 
over a few beers, but you refuse to answer my e-mail.

Go ahead with your "slapping."

Of course, I'd treat a "slapping" as an assault. I'd love to put a
clip of hollowpoints through your chest.

Your place or mine?

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't
allowed.
