To hell with it, lets just send it over a modem and claim its Analog not
electronic transfer.  If MA-Bell (or sibling) wants to change it from
Analog to Digital for overseas transfer then THEY can go after MA-Bell. 
Then if we can't do that then we would not even be allowed to discuss
cryptography (code) verbally as it all gets transformed to electrons now
anyway.  

Can we discuss cryptography code verbally(using sound waves)?

What is the difference between me reading(using sound waves) code line
by line to John Doe versus having my computer(using sound waves)
communicating to John Does's computer,Tape Recorder(high quality), or
his well atuned ear which understands MODEMese (or was that MODEMonics)?

Oh well, it was a good 20 second(or was that 2 second) thought, but I
don't think it'll hold up in court :)

Is anyone geting tired of Uncle Sam (or is that Uncle BAN)taking away
the freedoms that we have fought so hard for, and are trying to give to
all these third world countries such as Bosnia(Oh hell did I mention
something about politcs, Oops)?
