All media, all forms of expression are protected by the first amendment.
It's just that this protection is not absolute.

If the government wants to curtail freedom of speach it has to demonstrate
a compelling interest and further demonstrate that the means used are
narrowly tailored to achieve that compelling interest in the least
restricitve manner possible. Both have to be demonstrated to the courts'
satisfaction, a task quite different from (and, methinks, easier than)
demonstrating this to our own satisfaction.

These regulations explicitly say that you can transport printed information
including source code out of the country. No prior approval of any sort is
required. These regulations do not prohibit communication that requires
source code to be effective.

The government's claim is that in the interests of national security,
export of cryptography must be prevented. By limiting the policy's
applicability to media which are in, or can easily be converted to,
electronic form, the government has narrowly tailored this component
of the policy to prevent crytographic source code from appearing in
foreign computers without preventing the communication of that source code.

Cheers,
