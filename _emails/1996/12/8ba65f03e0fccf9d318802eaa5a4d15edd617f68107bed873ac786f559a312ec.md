Yes, the same Germany that is restricting Internet access, that proposed to
jail Compuserve executives for allowing banned material on the Net, and
that has laws  making various opinions illegal (specifically, the opinion
that the Holocaust never happened as the official version declares, or that
Aryans are superior to non-Aryans, etc.).

I enjoy all three countries, as a tourist, but I strongly doubt the "its
people mind their own business" characterization, even for Switzerland
alone (and certainly not for Germany).

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
