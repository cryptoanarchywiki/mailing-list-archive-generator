I believe it was Thomas Jefferson who was successful at getting the
practice of  primo geniture outlawed in Virginia (it was later adopted by
all the other states).  He believed in a 'meritocracy' or sorts and abhored
any practice which would create a merchant or political aristocracy in the
new Republic.  Unfortunately much of his wisdom was ignored (e.g. objection
to a central bank, and the forbidding of one generation to indebt another)
and we suffer the consequences to this day.
