Dale, the "bullshit" I referred to was not yours, it was something that
you mentioned, so do not take it personally. I read your messages with
interest.

Absolutely agree. Another problem in measuring "environment" is
that it is rather hard to quantify.

It is a good question. To me, the study can be done by the worst assholes
on the Earth. As long as their data can be verified and their methodology
is known, I have no problem with personal biases of researchers.
