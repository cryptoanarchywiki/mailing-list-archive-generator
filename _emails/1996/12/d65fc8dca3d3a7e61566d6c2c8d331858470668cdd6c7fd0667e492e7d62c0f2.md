In the interest of reducing the amount of argument, let's speak more
precisely:  I think people *do* have the right to demand such a thing,
although they do *not* necessarily have the right to force such a thing.
Perhaps there is a thin line between "demand" and "protest", but most
subscribers should be able to figure it out.

I can't argue the responsibility part.  As far as the size issue, it was
raised (sadly) several days and hundreds of postings *after* Dimitri was
excommunicated from the list, by none other than T.C. May.  Tsk, tsk.

I made note to this list time and time again requesting that people not
state the obvious - who owns what hardware and what rights they have to
pull the plug or whatever.  I seriously doubt that even the least
intelligent cypherpunk would misunderstand such a thing. Do you really
believe that myself and other cypherpunks want to "seize" John's equip-
ment, morally or otherwise?  You are correct about certain issues being
complex, but one of the big failings of the crowd who supported Gilmore
on this action was their failure to understand the point I've made here -
that we *do* understand basic property rights, etc.

How can I say this better?  Myself and a number of other people would
really have appreciated it if John had defended himself.  The fact of
all these other would-be experts on cyber-rights and morals preaching
to the list on behalf of Gilmore, and Gilmore being silent, argues
(not proves, just argues) heavily in favor of Dimitri et al.
