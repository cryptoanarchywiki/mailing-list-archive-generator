...and who's to say he didn't? Anyone who bought it--the Russians, for
example--would hardly have been likely to publicize their purchase.

(Maybe if _we_ purchased it, we'd publicize the purchase, but nearly anyone
else would not.)

According to tonight's news reports, he was in charge of
counterintelligence against the Soviets and then the Russians in the New
York area. This gave him considerable access to surveillance and crypto
methods. Note also that James Kallstrom heads up the New York FBI office.

(Maybe he knows some members of this list.)
