Actually, I think this is a very valid implication.  One of the main ways
in which statist societies justify their restrictions on individuals is by
reifying large bodies of individuals and giving them their own rights and
responsibilities _as_a_seperate_entity_.  To speak of a mass of individuals,
whether you call it a corporation, a collective, or a government, as having
a different set of rights than the individuals who make it up, is the
heart of statism.

Exactly.  Like most, I have a strongly visceral negative reaction to bigotry.
I wish there could be a system of law which contained it.  There cannot, or
at least not without doing even more harm.

What will contain bigotry is education and example which inculcate this same
visceral response to the destructiveness of bigotry.  Unfortunately, statist
systems (and IMHO especially those of a cpaitalist nature) thrive on turning
subsets of society against each other, so that the populace are to busy to
turn against the state.
