Eudora/PGP Plug-In

    Download version 0.20 from the Web: 
    http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~gt6525c/eppi/epp16_02.zip
    (for 16-bit version of Eudora 3.0 for Windows 3.1) 
    http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~gt6525c/eppi/epp32_02.zip
    (for 32-bit version of Eudora 3.0 for Windows NT/95) 

If you don't have Web access, but have FTP access, try the following sites.
Note that if the version you are trying to get was released today or just a
few
days ago, it may not have shown up at the sites below yet, so give it a few
days:

papa.indstate.edu: /pub/winsock-l/mail/epp16_02.zip
                   /pub/winsock-l/Windows95/mail/epp32_02.zip
                   /pub/winsock-l/WindowsNT/mail/epp32_02.zip

ftp.winsite.com:   /pub/pc/win3/winsock/epp16_02.zip

What is EPPI?

EPPI is the acronym for Eudora/PGP Plug-In. It is a "Plug-In" module for
Eudora for Windows. Eudora Plug-Ins are simply programs that utilize the new
Extended Messaging Services API (EMSAPI) that were introduced with Eudora 3.0.

EPPI makes it easier to use PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) with e-mail via
Eudora. Note that EPPI does not contain any encryption/decryption routines,
so it
should not violate anybody's export/import restrictions. It simply calls
the PGP executable with the appropriate command-line options in order to
perform
the requested functions. It's also 100% free! Get a copy, give it to your
friends, spread it around...
