	That some groups not within redlines have high default rates is not
an argument against groups within redlines having high default rates. The
market distortion caused by government sponsorship is certainly relevant to
whether individuals are offered credit; I would suggest that in many cases
the students in question would not be offered credit, as per their high
default rates, if it were not for government sponsorship removing the risk
from the lender.
	You have also not bothered to answer the criticisms from Mr. Rackham
about why, if the sole motivations were racism and ignorance, people would not
be offering the residents of such areas loans; as (he?) pointed out, this would
appear to be a particularly attractive move for middle-class blacks, if your
assertion was the case.
