In NYC you see occasional signs in severely corrupted French, which is
supposed to represent the dialect spoken by the inhabitants of Haiti,
many of whom actually strive to speak "correct" French, or at least
to spell it "correctly". (Note the quotes - I have no respect for the
academy or any other authority that presumes to decide what's "correct").

Maybe "Yebonics" (this sounds better in Russian - I'll let Igor translate)
is a step in the right direction to allow the English language to continue
its natural development and to become more like Chinese. I work sometimes
with folks from the Carribean who are well-educated but choose to speak
the dialect and frankly I find it more logical. Or maybe I just like these
guys and my perception is skewed.

"I be, we be, you be, he/she/it be, they be" - good.
"I go, he go" - good.
"I done go" instead of "I went" - good.
"Keyboard belong me" instead of "My keyboard" - good.
The last one is actually not Black English, but the Pigin English spoken
in papua-new guinea.

In NYC a student with a Spanish surname will be forcibly put in ESL even
if neither s/he nor the parents speak a word of Spanish, or want to. It
brings more money to the school. (That's only in public schools, of course).
Expect black kids to be forced to stidy "ebonics" whether they want to or
not, while white kids will study something useful.
