So what is going to happen if I generate one of their tags from scratch
without filling out their questionnaire? Are they going to sue me, claiming
that they own an html tag? Can one own an html tag?

"Owning" an html tag is oversimplifying things; but claiming that you've
been rated a certain way by a certain group (if you haven't) could
potentially create fraud, trademark, and (maybe) copyright problems - an
easy analogy is to the "UL" and "Good Housekeeping" symbols displayed on
some consumer goods.
