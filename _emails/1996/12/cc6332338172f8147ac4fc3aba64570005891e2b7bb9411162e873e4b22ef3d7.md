Good folks who already have too much to read:

I encourage that everyone who gets spam like that which follows 
forward the original message BACK TO THE SENDER (several times) 
demanding to know "what the hell does this have to do with 
cryptology, spammer ??" attached to the * end * of their quoted 
text.  Hopefully, the response that they receive will be 
"overwhelming" :)

If (s)he has to search through every message looking for 
"good replies," then they may be less inclined to solicit for 
such a voluminous response in the future.
