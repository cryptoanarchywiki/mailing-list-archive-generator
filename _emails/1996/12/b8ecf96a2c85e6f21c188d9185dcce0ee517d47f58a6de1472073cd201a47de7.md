        every now and then, the southern end of a northbound horse,
    with the creative writing talents of a recent graduate of the State 
    School for the Mentally Deficient, backs into town.

        his favourite site: http://pages.prodigy.com/VT/hackersguide

        somebody ought to tell the poor soul on a horse with no name he 
    aimlessly backed into town lacking the ability to aim.

        the moniker tells it all: BJORN2LUZE
        the origin confirms it: @prodigy.com
        is MALLAMACE an abbreviated anagram for 'malicious mace?'

    but, then again, maybe he sounds intelligent on Prodigy....

        shilling for the apocalypse  

  ==
   Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.
     The courage to change the things I can.
       And the wisdom to hide the bodies of the people 
         I had to kill because they pissed me off.
