Igor sure has better manners than Timmy, so whose cow should moo...

Anyways Bill Palmer is a really cool guy. Bill, if you care to comment
on issues of cryptoanarchy and content-based plug-pulling and are not
afraid to join a high-volume mailing list, please send this command
to majordomo@toad.com:        subscribe cypherpunks

Note that you can send contributions to cypherpunks@toad.com even if
you're not subscribed.

You can also cross-post anything you post to alt.flame to mail.cypherpunks.

Have fun - I'm looking forward to your contributions.

Thanks in advance,
