	The plus side of the Vigenere and ASCII ciphers is that they are fast. For
example, on a friend's machine, I can get 1.7mb/s using ASCII while NewDES,
the fastest "secure" algorithm, runs at a only 600k/s. Documentation of
each algorithm with an explanation of its security is provided in the help
file. As for snake-oil, this is a genuine product. I am trying to compete
with Puffer 2.0, which costs like $25-$30; $5 is certainly less than that.
As soon as I get the money to buy the needed compiler, I'll make a port to
the Mac, and a port to Windows 3.1 should surface in a few days.

	I'm working on installing Linux on my machine and will be working on an X
port. I'll keep you posted. BTW, I personally really enjoy using VGP and
have encrypted all of my source code and other archived things like that.
