	While not a bio_chemist_, I am a molecular geneticist who
has heavily used PCR in the past - and am interested in learning
more about why particular "tweaks" work the way they do. I'm also
probably more familiar with immunology and with molecular
neurology (at least if you're meaning neuropsychopharmacology) than
most scientists outside those fields - certainly more so than most
people. There are still a few of us like that... and I'm Generation
3 in TCMay's terminology. BTW, I have taken physiology, and in its
human physiology manifestation it's actually a growing field in
the biomedical sciences area. Sure, a lot of people are
overspecializing up the wazoo... but those of us who don't are getting
more done.
