	I mean conclude. For me. I am the authority on all. I am just personally a
little sick of this Ebonics thing, as we have obviously irreconcilable
positions. I tried to take a concilliatory position with which all would
agree. It has little to do with cryptography and is a stretch even for this
generally weird mailing list.

	No. I'm right and you're wrong. Face it. :-)

	I personally have no problem understanding Southern accents. Other people
have stated that they have problems understanding Ebonics, so I was just
playing devil's advocate and taking another, conflicting position. I sense
that one of the reasons why *some* people are so disgusted with Ebonics is
that only black people speak it. I am just responding to those racist
sentiments (Ahem. Timothy May) and trying to present a white example of
muddled speech. Also, the entire issue of clarity of speech is relative and
*will* be different for each person, another thing many people are
ignoring.

	Again, I was being devil's advocate and imitating other people's distaste
with Ebonics. Your rather biting comments describe their narrow mindedness.
