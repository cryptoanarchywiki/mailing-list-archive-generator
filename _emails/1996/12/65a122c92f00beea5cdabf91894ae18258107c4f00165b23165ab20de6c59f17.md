DEC PDP 11's - spaghetti code extrordinaire! :-) 

I reall don't miss those old beasts, but they did provide the means to 
learn quite a bit about how a computer (of the day) really functions. 
It's too bad that kids today haven't been subjected to the experience - 
we might start seeing a better appreciation for coding, as well as some 
innovation outside of the "objectivfying" development that is bloating 
many a Wintel hard drive.
