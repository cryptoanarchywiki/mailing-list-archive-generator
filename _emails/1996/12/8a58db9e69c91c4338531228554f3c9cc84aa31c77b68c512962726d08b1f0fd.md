Why TCM is wrong about PICS being wrong:

>(effectively).

bzzzzzzt. please read about it. there are multiple protocols. some
of them allow third-party rating services. some of them support
ratings within pages. the standard is neutral.

you have a good point, but PICS is about letting the net decide. it
supports both self-rated and third-party ratings. we will see whether
one eclipses the other in the long term. personally I suspect both
will coexist.

this is a ridiculous misunderstanding of the rating system concept.
the PICS standard expressly supports diversity by letting a thousand
rating services bloom, to borrow a phrase from your own book.  some
rating services may claim to be canonical, but you don't have to
believe them. there will be competition of rating services for a long
time into the future. this has already happened with all the filtering
software out there. 

also consider the new Firefly system that doesn't
actually have fixed ratings on objects, but in which ratings are 
determined dynamically based on your own personal ratings of pages.

 Consider

>being the name of a bird...would an animal-lovers Web page or posting with
>"Tits and Asses!!!" prominently in the title be PICS labelled as obscene?
>Some would surely think so.).

this would be an example of the most rudimentary and simplistic filtering
or rating service, which of course the market would generally ignore
in favor of more sophisticated alternative schemes.

that's exactly what PICS is about when you read about it more deeply.

PICS supports both, as it was expressly designed to.

what Timmy is repeatedly failing to comprehend despite much
evidence staring him in the face is that ratings services are
going to be a very significant new information industry, if they
haven't already become one. there are now many different filtering
packages out there and the market is large for them, as has
been proven by *existing* sales. this industry will grow. yahoo
and many other indexing services are in fact implicitly
rating systems, because they utilize editorial discrimination in
deciding who to include and who to exclude.  they just don't say,
"this is rated yahoo approved" overtly.

(timmy is also upset that a massive new industry is growing without
his personal approval or anticipation. I will amuse myself by
counting the days until he does a flip in position and begins
to advocate rating system's efficacy while pretending his position
was never otherwise)

let a thousand rating systems bloom. PICS is about finding good
content as much as rejecting uninteresting content.
