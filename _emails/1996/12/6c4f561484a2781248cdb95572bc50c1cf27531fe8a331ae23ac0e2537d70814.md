I'd say remailers have been a pretty powerful weapon in our arsenal, as
have been offshore sites, the "anarchy" of the Net in general, and, of
course, PGP and other such programs. The government clearly views strong
cryptography as a weapon, as a munition. More on this later.

I gave up on trying to "appear reasonable" long ago. Take it or leave it.

"Extreme step" doesn't mean doing anything that is traceable to a
particular person, and certainly doesn't mean doing militia-type things to
physical buildings or the criminals who work in them.

Rather, pushing for things like violating the ITARs, which we do. (Bill
Frantz noted, tongue in cheek I think, that Cypherpunks do not adovacate
breaking such laws. Well, this is of course absurd. Our whole focus on
steganography, on remailers, on carrying CD-ROMs out of the country, etc.,
is basically advocating various circumventions of USG laws.)

Gilmore's SWAN (getting machine-to-machine links widely encrypted) is
another "extreme step."

As to our "reasonableness," I make little effort to hide the fact that I
support strong cryptography because it means that the plague of democracy
and "mob rule" can be turned back...I view crypto anarchy as an elitist
development, one which the ubermensch will appreciate, but the masses will
recoil in horror from.

Fuck the herd.

But most of the active voices here are simply *not* "mainstream" and
"conservative" (except in some senses).

>If the ITAR regulations can be amended to make discussions on this
>list a "conspiracy", then they are very likely unconstitutional.
>Article I, Section I, "All legislative powers herein granted shall be

Careful, Red! Would it make you happier with the ITARs if Congress passes a
law enacting the regs? It won't make me any happier.

I agree. But there are plenty of forums (fora) for "reasonableness" (some
would say namby-pambyness). EFF is one such "reasonable" forum.

Our focus is more radical. We are effectively a cyber-militia, fulfilling
Jefferson's recommendation that a revolution happen every 20 years.

(Funny, there hasn't been one in more than 200 years. Jefferson would
likely be shocked. And the Founders who revolted over comparatively
miniscule tax rates imposed by the King, would surely be stunned by the 50%
or more in taxes paid by many or even most taxpayers. And the laws of all
sorts.)

I'll continue to be radical in my views. Nothing wrong with extremism in
the defense of liberty, as some wise men said.

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
