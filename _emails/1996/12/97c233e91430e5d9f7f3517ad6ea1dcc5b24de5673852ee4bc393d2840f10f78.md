I'm not sure that you can go through such a procedure to attain a legal
"alias"; but on the other hand why the hell would you want to?

Think about it, if you will paper work with an institutions to attain an
alias you would have to give them in formation about you identity.  Short
of commiting fraud by giving false informaiton do you think that you have
really gain any privacy?  Anyone can still find out who you are.
