The list is archived on the Web in real time, and you don't have to 
be a subscriber to post to it.  I have participated in the list during
periods when I was not "suscrived" with little noticable loss in 
functionality. 

Facts, which, if known to Gilmore, would have prevented him from making
a public ass of himself.  Heck, we never unsubscribed Detweiler, and
he was certainly consuming orders of magnitude more bandwidth than the
good doctor ever has, regardless of what one may think of the S/N ratio.
