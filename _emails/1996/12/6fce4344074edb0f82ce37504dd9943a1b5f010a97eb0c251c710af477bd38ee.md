No.  The person who wrote the checks was a secretary for the guy in 
California who ran the pool.  While we could've asserted jurisdiction and 
prosecuted her, we didn't because she had no idea why the winner wanted 
it done that way (3 $9k checks) and satisfactorily answered the question 
put to her.  The lawyer lied big time, when initially interviewed, which 
is in itself a crime.  

And most of the members of the relevant section of our office had to recuse 
themselves, because they play basketball with the guy.
