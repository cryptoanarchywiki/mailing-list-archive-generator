Someone is sending me lots of requests, with forged from addresses,
asking that the cryptography mailing list sign up
"cypherpunks@toad.com" for the cryptography mailing list.

I'm obviously not going to do it. The only result repeated requests
will have is that I'll put in a regexp to filter all the mail with
these stupid requests.

In other words, stop. There is no point.

Perry
