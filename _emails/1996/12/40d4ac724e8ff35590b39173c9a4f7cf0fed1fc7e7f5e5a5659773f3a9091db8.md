    I couldn't believe my eyes when reading through Inter@ctive Week's 
"The Driving Forces of Cyberspace" Top 25 list I saw that Louis J. 
Freeh, Director of the FBI received an Honorable Mention because of him 
supposedly believing that "Encryption is an inalienable right."  I 
suppose that isn't necessarily a lie, but it would need the word "Weak" 
added on to the front in order to qualify it.  Anyway, I was quite 
disappointed in seeing their poor choice of this candidate.

           "The term 'hacker' is not necessarily derogatory.
          A small percentage of them give the rest a bad name."
