 This is one of the social ills potentially caused by discrimination.  Far
more important to me than the politics of any time is the music that a time
period presents.  But this visionary jazz musician was all but discredited
by the musical environment of the times.  Thankfully, it survived on its
merits.  But imagine if the campaign to discredit Coltrane had been
successful and my young ears never experienced that beauty.  That is part
of the potential harm I am talking about.

Many of us take many different routes.  Most of us fill our days taking
action and have precious little time to enlighten people other than those
