12-27-96. WaPo snippet:

China said it plans to strengthen its already strict controls
over the Internet. The China Consumers Daily, an official
newspaper, mentioned the planned tighter controls in a
report on a recent conference in Beijing, but did not
provide details. Earlier this year, China required Internet
users to register with police and warned that laws
against pronography, social disturbances and breaches
of state security apply online.

Sounds like US policy foretold, boiling the frog. The 
Administration's current CN policy must include a 
secret GAK-product sharing deal, to parallel those with
OECD and the world's big-bit-fearful.

Behold the burgeoning, slobbering, Key Recovery 
Alliance: billions of targets to be tracked, keys shared
with authorities who give out the contracts, profits 
ka-chinged (low pun).

Gerstner says he can't believe the money IBM's going 
to make off sweet deals to control the Internet -- just
like the old days before the anarchistic start-ups got 
uppity and out-foxed the old-money-archists.
