I seem to have edited the previous message badly and left out the
context which was false labeling on pages for which there was a 
charge to view. More along the lines of false advertising to be sure
but still fraud in my opinion.

Also, of course, it would be very hard to show that you were not,
in fact, the Messiah (;->).
