See, right above there.

If I earned my very own money honestly and I choose to lend it only to
Albanians, you believe that this would be inefficient and, therefore,
forbidden.  In other words, you do not believe that I should be able
to lend money to anybody I please.  You can call it "equal access to
capital" or "denial of opportunity", but the clearest and simplest
description is that you believe I should not be able to lend my money
to whomever I please.  Instead of pretending otherwise, just say "I
believe you should not be able to lend your own money which you earned
honestly to anybody you please.  I believe you should be allowed only
to lend money in these circumstances..."

Of course, non-discrimination is a vague term.  Let's say I lend money
only to people I know.  I only know Albanians.  Am I therefore a
racist in my lending practices?  That is unclear.

Am I racist in my choice of friends?  Perhaps we should make that
illegal.

>I have never suggested that provably bad credit risks should be given money.

What is irksome is that you are talking about Other People's Money and
not your own.  The perspective tends to change when it's your own
savings on the line.

Actually, I have trouble following your argument.  Please forgive me
for my limited intelligence.

If you are arguing that the current policy is just, that question is
not related to whether it is the current policy.  But, I suppose you
were just sort of observing on the side something like "oh, and by the
way, this is current policy."

I do not know what is in Title VII.  Perhaps it would be better to ask
me about particular policies.

In fact, I am open to the possibility that poor people really are
disenfranchised.  But, if I am to believe that I must hear an
explanation that makes sense to me.  If poor people are poor because
absolutely nobody will do business with them for completely irrational
reasons, that seems extremely unlikely.  Even if most rich people are
able to control their greed just to punish poor people of the wrong
race, which is already hard to believe, you actually have to claim
that they are all this way.

>I understand the ramifications of "no possible recourse".  How should
>poor people save money?

Just like anybody else does.  You watch every penny.  You don't eat
meat.  When you buy food, you buy inexpensive healthy food like
lentils instead of expensive unhealthy food like Coca-Cola and potato
chips.  You do not go to McDonald's.  You walk when you can instead of
taking the bus or you ride a (used) bicycle.  You don't smoke
cigarettes.  You do not buy alcohol.  You do not buy other
recreational drugs.  You buy your clothing used.  You economize on
your living arrangements, perhaps by having a large number of
roomates.  (Note that this is illegal in most cities.  That is a form
of disenfranchisment.)  You do not make long distance calls.  If you
can, you share a phone with other people. etc. etc. etc.

If you know poor people, you will know that few of them do these
things.

Also, you work hard to increase your earnings.  You show up at work on
time every time.  You develop a good work ethic.  You wear clean
professional clothing at work.  You treat your employer and coworkers
with respect.  etc. etc. etc.

Read "Your Money or Your Life" by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin.  It
outlines a workable program that all poor people - and quite a few
others - will be able to use to their benefit.

If you are going through prospective leads and the number of qualified
people is, say, 10 in 1000, you will make a lot more money than going
through a pool of leads that only has 1 qualified person per 1000.

But why isn't that good news?  If it's really market inefficiency, why
not exploit it?

A lot of human activity is irrational.

In the case of racism, it is difficult to even define what it is for
the purpose of writing a law under which people are to be prosecuted.
This undermines the rule of law in the United States and opens the way
to abuse and political corruption.  Probably that was the idea.

But, even if it were possible to define precisely what racism is, I
would still believe it should be legal.  There is no accounting for
taste and it is wrong to dictate it to other people when they are
causing no harm to others.

Not one?  Absolutely no one?  That's pretty hard to believe.

Maybe there's something funny about the deal.

More to the point, why isn't Matthew J. Miszewski drooling in
anticipation of all the money he is going to make by recognizing this
glorious opportunity?  Giannini made a tremendous amount of money.

Even if you don't care about money, which is unlikely, think of all
the good you could do once you made that fortune!

Hmmm?  Maybe it was lousy investment in spite of a good ROI number.
Nobody?  Not one person was willing to buy in?  Hardly an endorsement.

I'm hearing that cash register ringing.  Go for it!

Guess rents must be low too, otherwise why live there?  Rents are a
dominant expense for poor people.

That's easy.  Once a month get ten families together to go to the
nearest warehouse store in the suburbs and stock up on provisions.

Or, one poor family could buy a bunch of stuff every month and sell it
out of their house and save everybody the trip.

Discussions regarding "the cycle of poverty" are usually little more
than litanies of excuses.

Gee, you would almost think there was something wrong with the
investment.

I challenge you to put your own money into this venture.  You don't
even have to quit your job to get into the microlending business until
you've built it up to the point where it can support you.

What I don't understand is why you are not excited by this
opportunity.  You claim there is this gaping hole in the banking
business.  If that is true, whoever exploits it is going to be
unbelievably rich in addition to being a great human being.

My point is not that there is a great opportunity so "somebody
somewhere" will solve the racism problem.  My point is that you
yourself do not believe there is a great opportunity if it involves
money you really care about, i.e. your own.

>Racism is irrational.  As you seem aware (BTW, I applaud you on what
>seems to be an honest degree of care)...

Don't get your hopes up.  I've been poor and I've known many poor
people.  The unpleasant truth is that there are usually reasons why
people are poor.

>>Oh, and speaking of racism, where do wealthy African-Americans invest
>>their money?
>
>Huh?  What is your point?

You are claiming that there are ZERO investors who will invest in this
great opportunity because they are racists.  Contrary to popular
belief, most African-Americans are not poor or even gang members.
There are large numbers of middle class African-Americans and a
smaller number of quite successful African-American businesspeople.

If everybody rich is a racist, go to these people and propose that
they can make money pursuing a business opportunity which they are
uniquely qualified to identify and exploit.

If you are claiming that even African-American investors are
irrationally racist about lending to poor people, you should be
forewarned that I and many other people are going to find that a
little hard to believe.

Wrong.  Redlining is devilishly difficult to define.  That hurts a
small bank more than any other because they have to figure out how to
comply with the law and defend themselves against the regulators
instead of just borrowing and lending money.  It raises the costs of
banking.  That means it is harder for people to borrow and lend money.
And that, if you care about efficiency, is inefficient.

I hate to admit it, but you do have a point here.

However, the way privacy will be permanently eroded is through laws
called "The Privacy Protection Act" which have clauses allowing the
government to do whatever it wants.  It is disconcerting to have the
government dictating what information you may or may not keep on your
computer or who you may give it to.
