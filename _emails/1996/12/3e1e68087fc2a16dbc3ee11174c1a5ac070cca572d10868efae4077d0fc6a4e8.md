 12-21-96. NYP:

 "Global Agreement Reached To Widen Law On Copyright"

 On-Line Material: International law would specify that
 copyright protection includes the right to control the
 on-line distribution of copyrighted materials, as well as
 the right to prevent others from making unauthorized
 copies.

 "Fair use" -- the tradition of allowing individuals to make
 a limited number of copies for noncommercial purpose, or to
 use brief excerpts in news reports or artistic criticism --
 would still apply in cyberspace.

 In a compromise meant to defuse one of the harshest
 criticisms of the treaty, negotiators agreed to delete
 language that would have treated even temporary copies of
 material downloaded from the Internet as possible
 violations of international copyright law.
