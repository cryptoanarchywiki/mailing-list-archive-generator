  You are talking about our first site, with music and movie recommendations.
I personally rated not-at-all-mainstream movies by Kurosawa and Tarkovsky and
got a similar advice.  Though, I agree, the recommendations are not perfect.
Partly, because the most of the audience are mainstream.  Partly, because
the site <www.ffly.com> runs the first version of our ACF software server.
The website recommendation uses the feature-guided ACF server that I hoped
would solve most of the algorithmic problems we encountered in the music
and movie domains.  I'd be interested to know what you think of it.

 Also: I created a group profile, name: cypherpunk, password: group
that people on this list might use together as a common interest view,
or a joint bookmark list.
