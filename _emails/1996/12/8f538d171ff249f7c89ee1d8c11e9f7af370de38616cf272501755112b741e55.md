I have a very intelligent friend who loves jazz and has several thousand
LP's; he says Coltrane did some really good stuff early on, then went
kinda crazy...  I bought some 'trane albums in the 1960's.  My impression
was that they were very intellectual, or very technical, but not highly
musical (my opinion, and I love music).

BTW, the person who claimed that Jazz was the more significant contribution
of African-Americans in America is very short-sighted.

Jazz is just one expression of a highly intelligent and complex group
of people.  You should hear some of the gorgeous songs of South Africa
as sung by Miriam Makeba, for instance.  Also, rock-n-roll emerged from
blues, R&B, etc., and is profoundly dominant in Western culture over all
other types of music, regardless of what you think of its quality.
