The transactions were reported as suspicious transactions. There could 
have been a reasonable explanation for them, but there wasn't.  When 
interviewed by the offending IRS agents, the target's story was 
ludicrous.  One part consisted of alleging that the first bank didn't 
have enough $100 bills to cash all three checks.  Whoooooops.  The bank 
keeps vault records, which I subpoenaed for the day in question. Guess 
what they showed.

No, but he wasn't going to be charged with evading reporting 
requirements, but rather with structuring a financial transaction *in an 
attempt* to avoid reporting requirements.

Hardly.  Juries are permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the 
facts before them -- the instructions about how the checks were to be 
cut, the three bank routine (along with what he said to the tellers at 
the branch that remember the transaction), and what he told the IRS when 
they interview him.  In addition to being stupid by going to branches of 
the same bank on the same day, he was stupid (and arrogant) by not 
exercising his right to keep his mouth shut when the IRS knocked at his 
door ... and then by lying to them.
