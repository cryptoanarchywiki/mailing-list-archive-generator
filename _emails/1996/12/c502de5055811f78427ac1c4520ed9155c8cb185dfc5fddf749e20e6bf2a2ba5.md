Subject: Articles on Your Web Site


Hello.

I am an attorney with Dow Jones & Company, Inc.  I came
across your Web site recently and saw that you have 
incorporated articles from The Wall Street Journal, which 
is a publication of Dow Jones.  Dow Jones is pleased that 
readers find information in The Wall Street Journal important 
enough to communicate to other Web users.  The articles I've 
seen are, or have been, located at

   http://jya.com/clash0.txt;
   http://jya.com/xpanix.txt; 
   http://www.jya.com/peanut.txt; 
   and http://www.jya.com/boomer.txt.


We also appreciate your encouraging others to take a look
at our articles.  The problem is that posting our copyrighted 
material at your site violates copyright laws, even if you give 
us credit, and even if you don't charge people to read the 
posted material.  The same would be true if someone were to 
republish material that you created without your permission. 
You can, of course, recommend stories from The Wall Street
Journal at your site by citing the headline and the date of 
the article and providing a brief description.  And those 
articles can be viewed quite easily for a modest subscription 
fee in The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition, the Web 
site of The Wall Street Journal (http://wsj.com).

While we hope you keep reading The Wall Street Journal, you
must remove our articles from any Web site you control as 
soon as possible.

If you want to talk to me about this, you can reach me at 
(212) 416-3108.

Many thanks.

Sincerely,

Hunter Farrell
Counsel
Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

We thanked Mr. Farrell for his courteous note, promised 
to keep WSJ articles off our site and read the paper.
