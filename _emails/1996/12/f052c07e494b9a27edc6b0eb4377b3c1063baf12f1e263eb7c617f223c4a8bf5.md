As I said, I have been filtering Ross Wright, along with about 20 other
such twits. I learned of his posting of my private mail to him from the
responses such as this one (and by Blanc, and one via a remailer).

Wright needs to learn some manners. As for my _threatening_ him, he's
welcome to contact his local police department if he feels I was being
"unfair" by responding to his threat to me by saying I'd blow him away if
he tried it.

As for me, if he carries through on his threat to "slap me around," I'll
welcome the chance to defend myself using the tools at my disposal.
