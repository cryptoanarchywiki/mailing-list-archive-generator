Sorry to quote so much, in this case it seemed necessary.

I apparently need to use those twirpy smiley faces more often (see above).
I meant that to be funny which I guess it wasnt.  

One of your (Tim) prior posts clarifies much.  That you hold out absolutely
no hope for democracy actually lets me in on why you express yourself now
like you do. My memory is that you werent always so clear in your
expressions of disgust; this memory comes from several non-derogatory uses
of the term "suits" when it came to cpunk political action in the past.  I
agree that democracy has myriads of flaws, but still hold out some hope for
change.

My comment about such inflaming language was of disappointment because Tim
almost single-handedly helped me reconsider many of my traditional
political thoughts.  It is difficult sometimes to get past the anger in
current posts (although I do understand and respect Tim's ability to be
absolutely honest about his views which is refreshing.)

Matt
