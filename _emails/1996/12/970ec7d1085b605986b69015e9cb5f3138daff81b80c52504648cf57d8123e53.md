Yes it was, you stated that "Armenians are murderous cowards", 
whether that is true in the majority of cases I am not well qualified 
to comment but to make a statement to the effect that an entire class 
of people are genocidal because a number (even a majority) of them 
are seems to me a sweeping generalisation.

My point was not that you had no right to be racist, you have every 
right to discriminate against someone on the basis of their colour, 
religion etc... my point was you are standing on very thin ice when 
you flame someone for being racist then post racist comments 
yourself.
