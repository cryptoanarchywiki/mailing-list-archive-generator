I dunno about processors which make that distinction, but it can be done
in software using page-protection features of the Intel CPU.  Under DPMI
for DOS and I would think somehow under Windows, the DATA segment can be
specified as loading into a seperate page/selector from the code (Im a
little hazy on the specifics), and that page then marked essentially as
"read only".

I think this was designed to make software more crash-resistant though,
not hack-resistance.  There's probably many ways to circumvent this
(explicity changing the access to that page, tricking the VMM into
swapping that page out to disk, then editting the swap file while it's
out there, etc).
