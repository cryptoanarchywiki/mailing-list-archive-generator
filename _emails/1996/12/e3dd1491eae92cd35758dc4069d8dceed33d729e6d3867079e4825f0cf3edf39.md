You've raised a point that is similar to the issues raised in FOIA
requests.  Is the reason I can't get certain documents because the
govt. is hiding something, or is it because they have to protect
"sources and methods"?  Now I understand the dispute on "methods",
but sources are often real people, whose identity may have to be
protected.

My question then, if police go 100% to secure transmissions, is that
a good thing for the public?  To be totally locked out of the ability
to monitor the police?  Of course, since I have an AOR AR-8000, with
even the forbidden cellular aliased out to the 1400 mhz area, I can
intercept anything and decode it (some problems with frequency-hopping
on cellular and some trunked frequencies), if there are no unusual
security methods used.

>From my experience so far, most of the public needs to worry about:

1. Doing business on cellular and other portable phones, where pirates
   are busy snooping.

2. Using a "security" company to watch your house when you're gone,
   since they generally talk openly on common scanner frequencies.
