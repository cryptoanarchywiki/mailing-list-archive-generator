You misunderstand what the statute intends.  The violation is for 
attempting to evade *the bank's* requirement to report certain 
transactions (i.e. >$10K).  He structured the transaction in an effort to 
keep the bank from complying with the law.

So you want the bank to be your nanny?  The guy is a lawyer and had 
previously been involved in transactions in which such reports had been 
filed.  What is your explanation for the three 3 $9k check request?
