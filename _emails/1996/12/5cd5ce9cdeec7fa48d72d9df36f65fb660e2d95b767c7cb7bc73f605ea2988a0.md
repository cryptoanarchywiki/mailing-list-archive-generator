     I think it was neither polite nor impolite. It was
a innocent transposition error.
     Correcting the error and apologizing were polite,
however. Do you disagree?  
     I have already raised the question of your apparent
lack of intellectual honesty in that you seem to not apply 
the same rules of conduct on yourself as you would on 
others. In English there is the saying, 'what is sauce for 
the goose, is sauce for the gander'. I note that you have 
spelt my name as 'logos'. As it is a proper noun in the 
usage and I have spelt it with the 'L', I would ask you if 
you consider this spelling of my name to be polite?
 
Logos out
