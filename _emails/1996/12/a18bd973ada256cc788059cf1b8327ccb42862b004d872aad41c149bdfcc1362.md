Now why didn't I think of that!

Maybe not everybody.  My scheme would not let you turn off the authentication
bit.  That means that if somebody does find way to get at the secret
key, they still can't run the code without doing something expensive with
particular processors.  Basically, this won't be worth the trouble.

The second group would have to buy a different processor altogether,
the way I proposed it.  But, that does not seem unreasonable.  One
could even imagine systems which have a "free" processor and a
decrypting processor.  While they would have to have completely different
instruction sets, they could be pin compatible.

I agree with all of this.  Some people might be happier if they think
of this as just another kind of agreement that people can make.  Right
now the software development agreement is weak because piracy is so
easy.  We rely a little bit on the law and a whole lot on the integrity
of customers.  Really, that isn't ideal.  It would be nice if people
could make strong agreements to write software.

My judgement is that software piracy is less of a problem in the U.S.
than it is elsewhere.  My impression is that there are many other
countries in the world where the whole "I should help pay for the
development of this software because I am using it" idea just doesn't
really show up on the screen.

This processor would make it possible to sell software to the whole
world without really worrying too much about how well each government
enforces its laws or how ethical the people in foreign countries are.

Processors are really only good for 3 years or so.  The vendor is only
betting that attacks won't become widespread in that time period.  That
is not a perfectly safe bet, but it isn't bad.  The attacks can exist,
but so long as they are expensive or hard to generalize to all processors,
the software vendors are safe.
