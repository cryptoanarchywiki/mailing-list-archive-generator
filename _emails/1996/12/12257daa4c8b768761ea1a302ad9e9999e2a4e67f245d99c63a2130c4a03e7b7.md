Give me a cite.

Fraud is an excellent answer because it is a meaningless answer.  Fraud is
traditionally used to prosecutue those not-quite-a-crime cases because the
definition essentially comes down to : "That guy did something we don't
like."

Honorary Knighthoods simply do not fall into this catagory.  There are
three or four cases on this point which I will dig up if enough people
complain.

In addition, I believe congressional approval was granted regardless for
Schwartzkopf.

Note that unlike your previous assertion, there is no rule regulating
these awards for the day to day citizen.

Playing loosey goosey with the facts seems to be a habit with you.
