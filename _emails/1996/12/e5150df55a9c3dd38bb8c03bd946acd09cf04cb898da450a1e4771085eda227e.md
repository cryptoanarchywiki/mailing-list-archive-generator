At that time the country was already at war and if you read the war powers
act and look at the dates, you'll find that he probably could have
prosecuted it without congress.

60 minutes did a nice piece on this, BTW, and even they admitted that the
wool might have been pulled over the eyes of the Bush Staff.

Prosecuted for what?

Careful.  The knighthoods in question (Knight's Cross of the Victorian
Order if I recall) do not infringe on foreign decorations restrictions
when they are granted in an honorary context, as both were - again if my
recall is correct.

Several American citizens have been inducted into foreign orders of merit
and some have been inducted into badge and even sash orders.

One noteable was even inducted into the Order of the Bath (extra points
for the name of said citizen).
