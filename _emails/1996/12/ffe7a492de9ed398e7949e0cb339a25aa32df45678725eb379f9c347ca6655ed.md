Sounds distinctly bogus to me...

Yes, there are a number of ways probably the easiest of which would 
be a proxy server. A number of corporations have these set up so 
their employees spend more time looking at relevant information and 
less looking at porn sites ;-)

I assume here he means that the pages will be encrypted at the ISP 
end and the browser will only decrypt the pages the user logged on at 
that time has access to. This all sounds very confused to me, he is 
talking bollocks I would wager.

I would be interested to see them but would guess at this point he 
doesn`t quite understand what he`s talking about himself...
