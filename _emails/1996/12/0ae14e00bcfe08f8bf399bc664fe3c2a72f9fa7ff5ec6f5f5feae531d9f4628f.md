OK - logos claims that he misspelled my name by accient.
Let's give him one more chance.

Because reading fantasyland jargon (like 'Toad Hall') wastes my time.

It's funny that you should say this, since Tim May and other prominent
"cypher punks" devote so much attention to their "enemies'" ethnicity and
religion. Recall the attacks on "crazy Russians", "immigrants who abuse
American freedoms", the recent attack on Hispanics, the attacks on Jews,
the attacks on Mormons...

I find it hard to believe that one misspells "Vulis" as "Vilus"
unintentionally, but I'll give you another chance...

Oops! I accidentally deleted a big chunk of my own article before
sending it out. Sorry. I'll see if I can find it.

You sound like someone who doesn't read this list, but only "reads the logs"
and sees the complaints from the likes of Arsen... I've recently quoted the
selected writings of Paul Bradley, most of which were far more "uncultured;
crude; or boorish" that anything I ever said. For example:

How do you expect one to carry out a _polite conversation with these "punks"?
I mostly choose to ignore this lot, or to re-state my opinion of them.

Paul tries to suppress the discussion of crypto on this list. Before I gave up
on this list completely, I used to think that it's a veru evil thing to do.
Even if there are problems with Don Wood's IPG cryptoscheme (something I don't
know to be true until I find the time to look at it myself), it's outright
evil to harrass Don the way Paul did. It's clear that Don knows more about the
field of cryptography than most people remaining on this mailing list. If
indeed there are holes in his scheme (and I don't know that), it certainly is
no excuse to submit him to the kind of verbal abuse that he's been subjected
to on this list. Would you submit the authors of the knapsack scheme to the
same kind of abuse because it was broken? In fact, how many people are there
still on this list who know what the knapsack scheme is?

You want intellectual dishonesty - look upstairs from toad.com.

The work of this list appears to be character assassination. If people like
Paul Bradley and Tim May insist on slandering people and trying to harm their
professional reputations (see the thread on "don't hire" lists), I will do my
best to defend them and their freedom of speech, and to expose the likes of
Paul Bradley - an ignorant buffoon out to silence anyone who knows more about
the field than he does.
