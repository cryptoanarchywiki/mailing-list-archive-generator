People who don't like using PGP, or can't use it, or won't use it,
do not belong on this list.

Easy.  Keep a copy of PGP there and a copy of the list public key.
It's okay to leave public keys lying around.

I might add that this is not "just a mailing list."  It is the
Cypherpunks mailing list.  It's worth a little trouble.  If you don't
agree, find a list which is.
