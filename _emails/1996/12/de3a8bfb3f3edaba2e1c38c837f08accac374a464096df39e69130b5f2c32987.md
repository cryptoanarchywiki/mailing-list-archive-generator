Careful. I didn't say precisely what Matthew said I said. My comment, from
some months ago, was, as I recall, that the people _most in need_ of
reading such a FAQ would probably be unreached by it. By "most in need" I
also meant the _developers_ of snake oil systems.

As a recent example, I rather doubt that the developers of the "virtual
one-time pads" and "really good Caesar ciphers" have seen the FAQ. Or, if
they have, that they understood the relevance for their own products.

The best "snake oil FAQ" is reading the first few chapters of, say,
Schneier. Those who read enough of Schneier are well-prepared to see the
flaws in "virtual one time pads," while those too lazy to bother are almost
certainly not likely to learn much from a FAQ.


I think it's fine that the authors of the Snake Oil FAQ generated it. To
each their own. My approval is not needed, as the Cyperpunks group is
neither a collective nor a democracy.

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
