Yes, and if I'd *ever* written a bad check, it would be a different
story.  The weasel there basically said that because I'd made
purchases there in the past few days, they tried to contact my bank on
a Sunday afternoon....  (No, I don't get it either)

But that still doesn't answer whether or not a credit card can be
requested when paying by check.
