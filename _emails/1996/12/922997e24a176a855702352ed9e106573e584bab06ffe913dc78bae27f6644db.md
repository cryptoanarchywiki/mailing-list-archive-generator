Q: Help! The password given to me doesn't seem to work! 

A: Please take note of the following when you are logging in to PObox. 

   1.The userid is just plainly the PostOne username, without the 
     @post1.com. Eg, if your pobox address is joe@post1.com, you will 
     login simply as joe. 
   2.Passwords issued are cAsE sEnSiTiVe.
