In a message dated 96-12-20 18:51:28 EST, you write:

<< How about the extra hard drive space you have to purchase because you
can't  
 just keep one copy on a server anymore?  >>

Well... considering most apps for client server (on the client machine) arent

Why on earth(forgive me if I am truly missing a point here)  would you put
