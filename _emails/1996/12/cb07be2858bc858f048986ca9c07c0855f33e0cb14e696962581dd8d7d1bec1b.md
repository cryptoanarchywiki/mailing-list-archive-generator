	Very Good Privacy is violating the trademark of Pretty Good
	Privacy.   At least this is a simple, straightforward 
	easy to see and easier to sue on violation than most 
	other trademark violation cases are.

	IDEA & RC4 were the only algorithms listed that AC2
	doesn't list 
	as having a security flaw.  And that isn't even true, if 
	one considers "weak keys" to be a security flaw, for IDEA.
	
	Some of the others are breakable on the fly, by a human.

	"Not used twice" is the operative phrase.
