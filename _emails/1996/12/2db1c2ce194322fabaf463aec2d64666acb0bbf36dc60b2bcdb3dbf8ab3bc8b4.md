[snippo]

If you could produce a 100% 'C' version, with in-line provisions for
replaceable 'C' or assembler functions, and insure that there is no
significant performance loss for having this portability, then you
could at least issue the 100% 'C' code for any machine or O/S.

This would make a lot of people happy if the application has wide
interest.  Is this possible, even if it's more work?
