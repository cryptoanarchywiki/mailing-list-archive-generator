Yes, many people understand. See messages over the past several years on
this list (before the S/N dropped to recent historic lows). See the many
discussions here and elsewhere of _real_ "digital cash."

"Digital cash" and "electronic commerce" are such hot concepts now that all
sorts of non-anonymous, fully traceable systems are being touted as
"digital cash."

These are indeed reasons to someday be even more concerned than now about
traceable transactions.

(Just for the record, what the hypothetical insurance companies and
employers are doing by using data they have obtained should not, in a free
society, be illegal in any way. All information contributes to
decision-making, about loans, credit, insurance, employment, etc. In a free
society, it is up to people to not disclose that which they do not wish
remembered.)

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
