Christopher Seline wrote a well-known critique in 1989 of 
TEMPEST:

   "Eavesdropping On the Electromagnetic Emanations of 
   Digital Equipment: The Laws of Canada, England and the 
   United States." 

It includes numerous citations, including those mentioned 
by Joel and the one you found. He claims that the Van Eck 
article was "purposely misleading."

We've put his article at:

     http://jya.com/tempest.htm

Seline promised a later version of what he called a rough
draft. Does anyone know of a successor to the 1989 article?
