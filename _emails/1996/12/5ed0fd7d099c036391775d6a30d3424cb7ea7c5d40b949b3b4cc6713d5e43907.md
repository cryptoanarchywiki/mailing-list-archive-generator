The current (Dec 2) issue of Forbes is a special -
the cover article is 'Cyber power gives financial
markets a veto over the President and Congress', by
Peter Huber. This has already been covered in this
list.

However, the real prize is a second complete magazine
included with the Forbes in a plastic bag - the
premiere issue of Forbes ASAP: "The Big Issue -
Where do we go from here?", which contains 53
essays from various commentators on the significance
and future of the techno revolution. I haven't 
finished it yet, but found the essays by Tom Wolfe
on the social implications of neuroscience and 
Mark Helprin on life's accelerating pace superb.

Other authors include: Gingrich, Fukuyama, Nader, 
Simon Schama, Rifkin, Esther Dyson, Al Goldstein,
Buckley, Paglia, Gates, Negroponte,, Richard Leakey,
Steven Weinberg, Brokaw, Limbaugh, Huber, and George
Gilder, among others.

Highly recommended!
