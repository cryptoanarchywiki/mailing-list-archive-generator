I very much doubt you have anyone whatsoever to agree with you on 
this. I very rarely post anything that is not crypto-relevant to this 
list, apart from my occasional indulgance in flaming people.

Don has a record of creating noise and flames on this list because he 
incites them, when someone refuses for example, to admit that a 
software generated random number stream is not a one time pad there 
is very little one can do to maintain a sensible discussion on the 
matter. Once Don conceded his system was not a one time pad I stopped 
protesting. As for Dons knowledge about cryptography I seem to 
remember him once promising to sell his company for $1 if his 
previous cryptosystem was broken which it summarily was. True, my 
flames of Don have maybe been a little more vitriolic than strictly 
necessary but he did ask for it..

No, because they would not for example initially claim the scheme 
was a one time pad then rant endlessly about QED and proofs of 
security based on statistical analysis of output data.
And as to your last question I for one do know what the knapsack 
scheme is, its a pity there were weaknesses as it was an elegant 
cryptosystem.

I am neither ignorant nor out to silence people. My knowledge of 
cryptography as compared to yours is not the issue, I post 
information and answers to questions that are of worth to the other 
members of the list, your knowledge of cryptography may be better or 
worse than my own, however, you have posted nothing crypto-relevant 
so we must assume you know very little.
