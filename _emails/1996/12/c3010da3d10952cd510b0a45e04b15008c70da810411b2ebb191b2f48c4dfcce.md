Funny, did he stutter when he said he regularly *practiced* such
discrimination at Intel?  (Such discrimination being based upon Title VII's
dispirate impact scenario, a law that Tim and others disregard as is their
civic, as in civil disobedience, duty.)  I guess he was unclear when he
stated "Fuck 'em" in a follow up post.  Tim is an anarchist (and I do not
mean that in any derogatory way).  He not only advocates, but he practices
what he preaches.

I think Tim's position was that if people couldnt communicate with him or
his supervisors he would not recommend their hire.  He had not stated as
you did above, although I do not doubt it is his belief.

P.S.  I have posted to rebut several political points made on the list only
to show that some of us on the list do not agree with certain viewpoints.
As Tim has pointed out, it has caused an innordinant amount of flame bait
and our signal is getting lost.  I do accept responsibility for setting
some of the fires but will now attempt to reply only to
highly-crypto-relevant material on the list.  Apparently folks get too
excited when others disagree with them.
