A good scenario. A truly paranoid premail users should verify who signed
the remailer keys. If you trust the signators and they signed the keys, 
you are "safe". Just do pgp -kvv some@remailer.com and see what comes up.

Maybe remailer operators should asks someone reputable to sign their
remailers' keys so that the users can easily verify the signatures.
