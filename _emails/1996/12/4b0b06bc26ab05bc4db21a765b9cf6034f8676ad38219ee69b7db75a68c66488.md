McINTYRE, executor of ESTATE OF McINTYRE,
DECEASED v. OHIO ELECTIONS COMMISSION
certiorari to the supreme court of ohio
No. 93-986.   Argued October 12, 1994-Decided April 19, 1995

a snippet from the synopsis...

After petitioner's decedent distributed leaflets purporting to express
 the views of ``CONCERNED PARENTS AND TAX PAYERS'' oppos-
 ing a proposed school tax levy, she was fined by respondent for
 violating 3599.09(A) of the Ohio Code, which prohibits the distribu-
 tion of campaign literature that does not contain the name and
 address of the person or campaign official issuing the literature. 
 The Court of Common Pleas reversed, but the Ohio Court of Ap-
 peals reinstated the fine.  In affirming, the State Supreme Court
 held that the burdens 3599.09(A) imposed on voters' First Amend-
 ment rights were ``reasonable'' and ``nondiscriminatory'' and therefore
 valid.  Declaring that 3599.09(A) is intended to identify persons
 who distribute campaign materials containing fraud, libel, or false
 advertising and to provide voters with a mechanism for evaluating
 such materials, the court distinguished Talley v. California, 362
 U. S. 60, in which this Court invalidated an ordinance prohibiting
 all anonymous leafletting.
