Actually I didnt say anything about private lending.  But as this thread

I dont assume that anyone (or any corporation) has earned their money
honestly.  Quite often that is not the case.  I have said a few times
already that I *do* believe in limited regulation.  And apparently you
believe that ad hominem is cool.

>Of course, non-discrimination is a vague term.  

Actually it is not.  I am an employment law attroney.  I know the
definition.  I know also what I need to do to prove it.  I also know that
many times the definition (legal) fails to meet the reality of the
situation.  But as I said before, we do not live in a perfect society.

Actually, in my case, it absolutely does not.  But as I said above, you
appear to continually assume things.  My perspective doesnt change, maybe
yours does.

It is all becoming clear to me now.  Perhaps you should understand what
laws you are rallying against before you attempt to defeat them.  I have no
need to ask *you* about policies.  Considering you have recently popped up,
you have not even a small collection of reputation built up.

My vocation is intimately involved with poor people.  I have been there
myself.  I do not defend my beliefs on those grounds.  If I did I could
easily just state the opposite.  But hey, Ill bet you arent racist either
'cause you have Black friends.  

The poor people that I help are nothing like the media productions you
believe in.  I realized after reading this last paragraph what kind of
person I am dealing with.  Poor people, in your eyes, remain poor because
they apparently have no will of their own to get out.  If you *actually*
understood utter poverty you would also understand the idiocy of the
statement.  Many of personal friends have 'escaped from the killing fields'
and have opened my eyes to the reality of the situation.  I will no longer
try to open yours.  You are not interested in learning anything.

That's right.  I forgot.  Poor people dont come to work on time. They dont
develop a work ethic.  They wear dirty clothes.  And they are
disrespectful.  And when they dont do these things they are not passed up
for promotion, never meet a glass ceiling and are never discriminated
against.  Now I get it.  What was I thinking?

Redlining occurs when people from these neighborhoods *go to the bank*.
Banks do not target these people.  When approached by them, the banks look
at the lines and decide.  They are not weighing whether to do business
there.  They simply dont.

Because I personally carry to high a debt burden to qualify for the loan.
I also suffer from doing something with my life that I both enjoy and feel
makes a difference.  I advocate for others that would like opportunity.

Yep, that was it.  We all got together in 1964 to try to find a way that we
could increase political corruption.  Read the law.

Try defining harm.  Try defining taste.  People like you have argued that
slavery caused no harm.  Disallowing women to vote caused no harm.  And of
course that discrimination in the workplace causes no harm.  You may
believe that in all of these cases the legislature should not have acted.
This just makes me glad that you are clearly in a minority, unable to
withstand the wheels of change.  You and Tim could start your own country.

That's it.  All those lawyers involved with putting together deals
(something they succesfully do for a living) put together a funny deal.
That's it.  It's a conspiracy.  Be careful everyone, the poor people are
planning something.  Run, run.

Just because a market exists that is far from stating that barriers to
entry arent enormous and that a market segment is sufficient to make
'tremendous amounts of money'.  Money is also far from my prime motivator.
This will be hard for you to understand, but apparently you have no
interest in expanding your horizons.

What are you talking about?  Good ROI, good investment.  How do you define
'lousy investment'?  Maybe you work for a bank?  What do you do?  Oh yeah,
you are Red Rackham.

Whenever a good point is made, you go to that nifty "ring, ring" crap.  Do
you deny that the default rate on student loans is outrageous.  Do you deny
that these people generally live out of the redlines?

Making the original capital in their basement of course.  How many

I keep forgetting that poor people want to remain poor.  When will I learn.
 They use up all their energy thinking up excuses.  Oil Company execs never
treat blacks differently.  Glass ceilings dont exist.  Hey if I keep saying
it maybe I will learn.

Actually, my largest investment is in a minority owned business.  Funny

I keep forgeting.  What was it stupid, lazy, smelly, discourteous?  I have
to watch the news more closely.

Where the hell did this come from?  I *never* asserted it.  Red must be
watching too much TV.

I know some of them.  They work very hard.  Funny thing is, Red, they sound

Racism is a dynamic of Power Red.  There are, unfortunately, successful
Blacks that do not help out the neighborhoods they came from.  They do not
credit Affirmative Action for its help.  Consider me 'forewarned'.

>>>Banks have practiced discrimination, and not just against black

I never mentioned that blacks were the only poor in this country.  That was
one of Red's assumptions.  Much like the ones about poor people being lazy,
dirty, blah, blah.

It costs money *to practice* redlining.  Not to eliminate the practice.  If
decisions are based on merit alone, where do costs increase.  Redlining
adds a layer of investigation to a loan analysis.  Eliminating it
eliminates one.

[Excuse the tone of the post.  Dealing daily with some of the effects of
racism, one gets sick of the same arguments and assumptions made by most.
I thought you were interested in differing points of view, but the tone of
your post suggested otherwise.]
