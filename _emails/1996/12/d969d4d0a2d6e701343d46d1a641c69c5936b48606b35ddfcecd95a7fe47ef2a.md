Actually, there is not only good evidence for the environmental argument,
but you can reason it out yourself if you give attention to some things
that don't make it into most discussions on this topic.

Example:  Environment has a profound effect on a person's mind (outlook,
perceptions, attitudes, moods, etc.), and thereby has a significant, if
indirect effect on that person's hormone production (quantity, balance).
Those hormone productions have more effect on the body and brain long-
term than any other influence I can think of.

And believe it or not, in some (perhaps unusual) cases, unexpected
changes in hormone production can happen later in life as well, not
just during the "development" years. And I'm not talking about decreased
production either.
