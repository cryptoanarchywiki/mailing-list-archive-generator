I doubt it- if everyone has no choice but to pay, why would software companies
lower prices? What would happen is a) less pirated software floating
around, and
b) software companies make much more money. I don't see prices coming down.

It doesn't have to break.

Example: Advertising agency, each designer's machine has at least $10k worth
of software on it. We upgrade the machine, we have to spend another $10k to
buy new software, or go through administrative hassle with the vendor to
get 'new' copies of the software?

Speaking from a Sysadmin's perspective, I wouldn't use one if you gave me
the hardware for free. With this scheme, the programmers benefit, the
end-users don't, and it's the end-users who have to buy into this for it
to work.
