Race bits, gender bits, etc., are all interesting possibilities. I
never thought about anyone wanting to do such a thing, but I suppose
that's likely.

I've tended to think that as we become increasingly digital, issues
like race become less significant (perhaps because it generally isn't
immediately obvious in this medium). This doesn't mean that prejudices
go away, it means that they shift to stay with what is obvious. For
example, people who are unable to spell well (and don't spellcheck
email and usenet posts), or use excessively poor grammar are often
ridiculed for their lack of mastery of the language in which they're
writing. Basically, the prejudices and such continue with us, but
change, so as to remain based on things that are easily discernible.

As I'm replying, it's occurred to me that we've already got some sort
of persona "certificates" floating around now. (Such as the Geek
Code.) Imagine a field there to include race. Wouldn't take a lot to
do that, after all.

Of course, the implementation of a race bit system that can be trusted
is another issue altogether. Would the White Boyz Club then need to
have its own trusted arbitrator to introduce people of the same race
to each other? (AryanSign?) Is a more elaborate PGP-style web
of trust used? Hmm.
