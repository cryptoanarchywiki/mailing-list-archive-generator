By the way, I was gone last week, and missed some of the follow-ups to this
thread. I did notice in Omegaman's replies that he was replying to
Detwweiler's wailings about "Timmy." (What's with Detweiler and Vulis both
being so hung up on such a nickname? If it makes them feel they're winning
converts, let them call me "Timmy." Jeesh.)

Sure, but my interest is in the possible, not the dumb mistakes of dumb
people. That some criminals will screw up and reveal their identities is no
different from the similar possibility that some people will mess up in
using remailers; doesn't alter the interesting properties of remailer
networks.

Perhaps. But I note that various "outrages" associated with use of Swiss
banks--Jewish gold deposits, banana republic deposits, tax avoidance,
etc.--have not exactly driven Swiss and similar banks out of existence.
Greed is a powerful lubricant. And there are of course various ways to make
the traffic less obvious.

Ed can of course redeem his Bank of Albania digibux at the Bank of Albania,
if worst came to worst and somehow the Bank of Albania was "frozen out" of
the banking community (see below for why this is effectively impossible).
Go to Tiraz, present the digibux numbers, take payment in paper dollars,
gold coins, whatever.

And, more importantly, the "doubly untraceable" nature of true Chaumian
e-cash means that the Bank of Albania _cannot_ be frozen out of the banking
system (assuming other banks are also issuing Chaumian cash). Any mechanism
that would allow the Bank of Botswana, for example, to "know" that the Bank
of Albania was buying untraceable Botswanabux would of course mean the
Botswanabux were not untraceable! Once Bank of Albania can buy such
untraceable currency, they can pay Ed off in them. Or variants of this.
(The similarity of a network of Chaumian digicash banks to a network of
remailers is obvious...indeed, Chaum's work on "digital mixes" preceeded
his work on digital cash, 1981 vs. 1985.)

Well, I agree with all of these points. They want deployment halted, or at
least slowed.
