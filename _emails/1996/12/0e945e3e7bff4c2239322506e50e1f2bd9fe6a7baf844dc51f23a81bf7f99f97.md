This thread is probably already due for a change in
the Subject line, but I'll leave it untouched for 
the moment.

And it sums to a very bleak picture, indeed.

Please forgive my naivete, but are there no legal
weapons available to the 'victims' in such cases?
I'm passingly familiar with the Operation Sundevil
fiasco -- i.e., with the outcome re the principal
'charges'.  I'm appalled, however, at the apparent 
lack of remedies for return of such seized property.
Are individuals who find themselves in such a 
predicament simply at the government's mercy (there's
an oxymoron for ya)??
