	In his Society essay, Lykken writes, "I will testify in
	support of a parental licensure bill to be introduced
	at the next session of the Minnesota State Legislature.
...........................................................

Someone needs to remind this Senator Lykken what happened in Romania, when 
the beleaguered citizen-units finally took their 'noble', social 
engineering leader Ceausescu, put him up against a wall and shot him.

History could repeat itself.

Ah well, but really the most that this proposed bill would accomplish would 
be a lot of discussion and a lot of attention being brought to the general 
awareness about where individuals stand relative to their *elected* 
government (in 4 years - out!).

Can you imagine the usenet discussions . . .all over the world.   You know, 
he could be doing everyone a favor by inciting fury in the savvy masses who 
would, in the process of complaining, educate the ignorant ones about the 
ethics of social engineering and the precautions against it, as well as 
about the character of people like this Senator.  A problem can be an 
opportunity in disguise!
