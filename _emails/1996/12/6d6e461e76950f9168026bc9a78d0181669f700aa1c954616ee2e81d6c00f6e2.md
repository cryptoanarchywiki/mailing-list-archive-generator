16. Section 734.7 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as
follows: 

734.7 Published information and software. 

                                          * * * * * 
Accordingly, such
encryption software in both source code and object code remains
subject to the EAR even if published in a book or any other writing                   
or media.          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
