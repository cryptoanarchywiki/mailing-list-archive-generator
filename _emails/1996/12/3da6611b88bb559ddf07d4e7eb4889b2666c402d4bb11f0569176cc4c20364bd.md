It's very simple, really.  Don't *anyone* speak for John, since John
exercised his *right* to expel someone, surely only John himself knows
the real reason(s), and anyone else's explanation is going to sound
hollow and unconvincing.  Doesn't anyone get the point?  John took the
action, you didn't, so either he explains or he doesn't, but I don't
think other people trying to explain for him accomplishes anything
except creating more bad feelings on the list.

No, I didn't mean that.  We've seen enough of that already.

Sounds good to me.  I don't try to keep track of who says what over a
period of time, which makes it easier to forget unpleasantness after
it settles down, even if other people don't forget my unpleasant moods
when I wish they would.

Maybe I shouldn't admit this openly, then, but I thought that admission
from Tim was quite significant, given both the physical limitations of
the processing hardware and phone lines, and Tim's apparent influence
with c-punks people, including (I would certainly guess) John Gilmore.

Convenience and practicality are certainly compelling, but...

Oh, I *do* understand.  I think personal privacy is sacred, even for
underage people who are frequently robbed of it unfairly by older people
and by bullies.  That's only one of the reasons I found the "Crypto
Anarchy and Virtual Communities" paper so interesting.

If you could analogize the list to a human society, then you might
understand that a pattern of decadence can set in here as it does in
the more visible society, as is run from Washington DC, etc.

It is my hope to make a contribution here (as in the more visible society)
to fight off some of that decadence, even when I get beat up on for it.
