Our paper on "Using Markets to Achieve Efficient Task Distribution" is
now on the web at

    http://www.systemics.com/docs/papers/task_market.html

as a working draft (please don't quote or disseminate - it is now "under
offer" for FC97).

I, at least, am going to have a break from paper writing and go have a
go at coding it, and all the other things in the queue.  However,
comments are most welcome.  Thanks to everyone who has commented so far.
