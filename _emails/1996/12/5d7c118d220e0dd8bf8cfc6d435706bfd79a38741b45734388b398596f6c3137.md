It has been speculated in the past that certain crypto schemes, such as
proposed by Microsoft and Sun, using signed crypto plugins might be helpful
to the cause for strong crypto if non-US branches of US software companies
would certify foreign developed crypto software.

According to the recent proposal by Commerce, this will not happen. It will
be illegal to export the software required to sign the code. So much for
the government's claim that they make no attempt to limit the export of
signing-only software.

[Listing specific software prohibited from export]
"c.2. "Software" to certify "software" controlled by 5D002.c.1; "

And, btw, virus checkers are also prohibited from export. Makes you wonder.

"c.3. "Software" designed or modified to protect against malicious computer
damage, e.g., viruses;"
