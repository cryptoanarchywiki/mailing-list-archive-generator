The fact that a bank complied with a federal regulation governing the 
bank is not similar to a business selling a defective product.

Apparently I do.  And that is that juries can draw inferences and that 
lawyers can call attention to possible inferences.  His lawyer could 
argue "no harm, no foul" and the prosecutor could argue that he intended 
to violate the statute, but got caught.  The jury would've then decided 
the issue, with the government bearing the burden of proof BRD.

And the State of California was free to prosecute him.  Most crimes are 
state crimes only; some have both state and federal aspects; others are 
solely federal crimes.
