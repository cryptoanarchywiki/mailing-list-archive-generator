heh.

This was so simple, it still confounds me.

I was asked for my social security number whilst writing a check last night
(my driver license doesn't have it on there).  I just said, "oh, I don't
have one, I'm not a citizen."

She bought it!  I got asked where I belonged to, so I said Germany (not
actually a lie, it's my heritage).  Next time I think I'll say Belgium.
What's that itty bitty country between France and Spain?  Angorra?  Yeah.
That's it.

I still find that the best line of defense regarding privacy is a complete
second identity.  Does anyone know how to apply for proper papers (taxpayer
ID#, checking account, picture ID of some sort) for a second identity?  As
far as I know, it is not illegal to have one, as long as it is not used for
fraud.  I'm an artist, yeah, that's it.

What, you really think someone's actual name is Jazzmin Belle Sommers?  Get
outta town!


Jazz
