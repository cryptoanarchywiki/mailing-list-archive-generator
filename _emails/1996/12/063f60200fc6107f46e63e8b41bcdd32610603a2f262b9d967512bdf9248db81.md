You are clearly not in the computer field. Someone who can't document
his or her program, or can't explain something to a colleague, can't do
the job. Communication may be irrelevant to an assembly line workers,
but it sure matters for computer people.

Once again I observe that "cypher punks" and "libertarians" are fucking
statists.

Yes, Timmy May is a racist asshole, but no, the fucking state should not
stop him from discriminating in any way he wants to.

If Timmy doesn't want to hire a good engineer because he doesn't like his
accent, his looks, his smells, his sexual preferences, it's Timmy's right.
Let Timmy punish himself by hiring the second best candidate and paying more.

The free market works. Don't fuck with it.
