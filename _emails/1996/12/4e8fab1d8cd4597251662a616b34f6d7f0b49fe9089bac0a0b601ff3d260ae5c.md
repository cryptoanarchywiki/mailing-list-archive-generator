The War on Some Drugs stikes again

Challenging it it court would be too much work and not
likely to succeed so why not just throw some doctors
in jail and scare the rest off.

>From AP via MSNBC:

       NEW YORK - The federal government has acknowledged 
  plans to prosecute doctors who prescribe marijuana and other 
  illegal drugs to seriously ill people under new laws approved by 
  voters in California and Arizona, The New York Times reported 
  Monday.
        Authorities plan to prosecute some doctors who help 
  supply such drugs to patients and strip their prescription 
  licenses, officials told the paper. Voters in Arizona and 
  California last month approved measures that relax restrictions 
  on the medical use of some illegal drugs. 
        The plan to move against doctors follows the Justice 
  Department's decision not to challenge the new state laws 
  in court. Federal officials also plan to launch a public-relations 
  campaign to remind Americans of the dangers of illegal drugs.

So remind me again, what exactly is the moral difference 
between Prozac and THC?

regards,
-Blake
