Yes, I was assuming a free market.  Sorry if that was not clear.

Not only would software companies face competition in the decrypting-processor
market, but they also face competition with other packages running on
other platforms.

Presumably customers would need some sort of reason to use the
decrypting-processor.  Some companies may choose lower price.

I agree completely!

This was discussed a few posts back.

Let's say you manage to get the secret key out of the decrypting-processor.
That gives you the executable which could run on any decrypting-processor.
Since it is not authenticated (*) you can't run it on another
decrypting-processor.  You can run it in emulation someplace else,
but a heavy performance price is paid.  If the leading edge processors
are all decrypting-processors, a very heavy performance price is paid.
If the instruction set is kept secret, even writing an emulator could
become hard.

(* I am being inconsistent, incidentally.  At one point I said that software
would be authenticated once, but I now realize that to prevent multiple
uses it has to be authenticated for use on a particular processor, too.)
