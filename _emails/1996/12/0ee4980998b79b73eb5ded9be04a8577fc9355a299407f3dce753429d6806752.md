I completely agree, if the labels, and their format, are mandated, then
it is
a bad thing.

'zactly.  Signatures are pretty easy, and DSS is free.  Compliance
testing
I'm not so sure about.  They should be able to finance the whole project
by
suing label forgers :-)

You can label it however you want, Tim.  But, most browsers won't
recognize these
ad-hoc labels, and many people will be blocked from your page.  Which is
fine, those people
have chosen to not see pages that aren't labeled in a way that they
understand, and
that is as it should be.

Again, the only fraud I would recognize would be if you created a label
that used
the trademark of a labeling company.  I completely agree that you should
be allowed
to describe your page in any way you want, or not at all.

We'll just have to see about this, won't we.  I'm betting that it will
work.
I think that you'll be able to set up your browser very easily to
restrict it
to only see the 5% of the pages that happen to be rated (these will be,
naturally,
from the big companies like Discover, Microsoft, McDonalds, and so on)
and these companies
will pressure the government to declare the problem solved, as the kids
will be funneled to their sites.
