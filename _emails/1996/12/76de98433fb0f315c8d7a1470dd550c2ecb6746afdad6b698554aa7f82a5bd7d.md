The real identities of people who use the "anonymous" remails to send out
"homophobic" or otherwise "politically incorrect" materials are frequently
disclosed on the "remailer-operators" mailing list. For example:

]Someone who proports to be from ******************* is sending out a huge
]spam/mailbomb right now.  I suggest you sourceblock the prick now.
