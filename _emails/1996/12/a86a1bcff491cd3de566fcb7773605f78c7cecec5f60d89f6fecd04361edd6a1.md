For those of you not aware of airport procedures, the real terrorism
threats are not only from ground personnel but those impersonating LEOs
(Law Enforcement Officers).  Fake badges are easy to come by and by filling
in a form anyone can get on board an airline with their firearm.  No
procedures are currently in place to allow airline or airport security
personnel to easily and positively identify bogus LEOs.
