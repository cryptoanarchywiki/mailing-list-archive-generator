Wow!  I am amazed the FCC has not come down hard on AT&T for something that
noisy.  (I have run my system with an open case and never gotten
interference that bad.)

<paranoia>
Or maybe it is a plot to keep an eye on Matt Blaze.  ("Here...  Have this
free company laptop!")
</paranoia>

Now the truly paranoia will not only cover their heads with tinfoil, they
will cover their laptops as well.

But seriously, it does not sound good.  I know there is specialized
equiptment used by ham radio operators to locate leakage of radio
frequencies.  Maybe someone could use it to find who the worst offenders
are and how bad the problem is.
