benjamin,

you do have a valid concern, but: 

who cares about these laws if no one enforces them?

russia is such a libertarian country now, all commerce is based on
private enforcement by mobs, the government is so corrupt that all
regulation is sort of auctioned to the highest bribe bidder, and the
government spending is only 13% of GDP because nobody pays taxes. in
economic reality this is actually good because the government is
very small and impotent, as long as it does not spend more than what
it makes.

nobody cares about encryption/shmencryption unless you are a spy.

i regularly send encrypted emails to my russian acquaintainces.

	- Igor.
