	The individual is a little shit operating a windows system on
IP address 206.129.116.108 as of Sunday evening.  While the messages
where poping up on cypherpunks, one of the Received-By headers was
indicating his IP address.  I was able to confirm his presence on the
network and determine it to be a windows system operating with the workstation
name of "MARLAEST" and a workgroup name of "ESTES ADVENTURE".  He's not
operating a windows messaging pop-up or I would have sent him an appropriate
message of appreciation.  Since it IS a windows system (and not running
sendmail) I think it is safe to assume that he IS the end point of this
bullshit.

	206.129.116.108 is in a block assigned to Premier1 Internet,
Coordinator Michael Heuerman, mikheu@PREMIER1.NET (360-793-3658), who is also
getting a copy of this...

	This individual is still on line as of 22:43 EDT 12/15/96

	Can someone kindly track this little asshole down and dump his sorry
ass in the nearest toxic waste dump?
