Are you suggesting that a fiduciary responsibility is violated by *not*
redlining?  I stated before that all *real* qualifying factors remain in
force.  The only irrelevant method to be eliminated is place of residence.
Granted, if a certain bank only made loans through direct mail campaigns or
some such, an argument *might* be made that risks are higher in certain
residential neighborhoods.

Breach of fiduciary duty would be thrown out almost immediately as a claim.

Actually, I mentioned redlining as an aside to a totally different point.
Red has asserted, and I tend to agree, that this is actually on point.  We
are discussing the possibilities of crypto anarchy.
