I walked straight through British, Dutch and Maltese Customs at the 
respective airports and they didn't even ask what was in the bag, let 
alone what software. I had PGP and a huge keyring stored on my hard 
drive and they were known the wiser.

I'd suggest to lugging them through as hand luggage. If you are 
worred, zip up pgp and so on with a password - if customs do check, 
they aren't gonna waste breaking the zip password (even though it can 
be done quickly)

Also, I think the law may different, as you are an American Citizen 
using your own equipment...
