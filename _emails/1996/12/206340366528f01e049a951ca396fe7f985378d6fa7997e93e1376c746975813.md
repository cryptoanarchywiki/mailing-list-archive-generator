If your processor dies you are SOL whether or not you have software.

If it's worthwhile having a backup processor around, then you just have
to spend a little more to have backup software, too.

If the reissuance of software is not possible (which I don't believe),
it's an acceptable risk.  Processors die far far less often than disks,
and disks are getting pretty reliable.

If the software companies can't get it together to reissue software,
then it would certainly be easy to sell processor insurance to people
who wanted it.  This would allow them to replace their ~$10,000 software
library.  (You can buy theft insurance for roughly the same payoffs,
so it's a feasible business.  Theft is harder to verify and in my
judgement occurs much more frequently than processor failure.)

If the old copy protection just worked, it would have been widely accepted.

Old copy protection had many problems.  It didn't stop piracy.  Sometimes
it crashed your machine.  Some schemes worked on some Intel machines but
not on others.  Backups were a problem.  Etcetara.
