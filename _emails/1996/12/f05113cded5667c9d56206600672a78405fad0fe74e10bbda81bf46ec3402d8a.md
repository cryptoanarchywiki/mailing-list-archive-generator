1. J. Jackson apparently now finds "ebonics" to be a "Goot Thang"(SM): _S.F.
Examiner_ reporter Venise (sic) Wagner headlines in the paper's Web site
today that "Jackson backs Oakland 'ebonics.' Rights leader switches position
after hearing about program in detail." Says Jackson: "The first message the
came out was that the district was going to make black language equitable
(sic) as another language.  That is not the idea." Is Mr. Jackson speaking
in Ebonics?

2. From "A Brief History of Plastics": "Ebonite (TM) is produced by heating
natural rubber with about 10% by weight of sulpher.  This is about five time
more sulpher than would be used in conventional vulcanisation. The material
is hard, black and tough and bears a striking resemblance to the hardwood,
ebony--hence its name. The main use for ebonite in the early 1800s was in
piano keys."

3. Although Ebonite International sponsors the Professional Bowling
Association's "Ebonite Classic" tournament, the Official ABC/WIBC Ruling on
Ball Cleaners, as at 9/12/96, has ruled that their 1-and-2-Step Reactive
Resin Ball Cleaners "cannot be used during ABC/WIBC sanctioned competition
because it would be in violation of Rule 19." But take heart: the American
Bowling Conference Equipment Specifications Department has decided that
"these products are allowed before or after league and/or tournament sessions."

4. What's the difference between a bowling ball and a black woman?  If
you're really, really hungry, you can always eat the bowling ball.

N.B. I personally find #4 above to be racist, sick, and not very "funny" at all.
