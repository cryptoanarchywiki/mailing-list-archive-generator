Part 744.9(c) of the draft regs:

# (c) Definition of U.S. person. For purposes of this section, the term
#     U.S. person includes: 
# 
#       (1) Any individual who is a citizen or permanent resident alien of
#           the United States; 
# 
#       (2) Any juridical person organized under the laws of the United States
#           or any jurisdiction within the United States, including foreign
#           branches; and 
# 
#       (3) Any person in the United States.

So it would be legal to sell books to foreigners in the US, unless that would
be "provid[ing] assistance to foreign persons" (744.9(a)).  Funnily enough,
"foreign person" isn't defined anywhere in http://jya.com/commerce.htm.
Is it safe to assume it means "a person who is not a U.S. person, as defined
in 744.9(c)"?  If that is the case, then teaching crypto classes to foreigners
in the US would be legal.

The new regs don't seem to have the exception for "mere travel outside of
the United States by a person whose personal knowledge includes technical
data" (ITAR, 120.17(1)).  Does that mean that such travel is now (or will
shortly be, when the new regs are enacted) illegal?  I find that hard to
believe (but I also find that virus checkers and firewalls are being
controlled hard to believe; hell, I find the whole crypto export policy
hard to believe).
