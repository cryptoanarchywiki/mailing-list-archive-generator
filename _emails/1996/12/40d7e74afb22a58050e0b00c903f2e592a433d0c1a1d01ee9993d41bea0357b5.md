What has happened to cypherpunks?  I joined this mailing list more recently
than many others who recieve it, but most reacently it has gone downhill.

The descriptions I have read (and I have read many) all state that this
list is deadicated to the discussion of cryptography issues.  Where the
hell is the discussion about cryptography?

Three fourths of the messages I have been recieving are off topic (Ebonics
and "Slaughter").  If I wanted to read about current events and holocost I
would have joined groups that were specified for discussion of those.
