There is an interesting debate going on between Jamie Love and Scott Hazen
Mueller over how to deal with the problem of email spam (does this
constitute as one?) in Brain Tennis right now. Mueller would like to get
rid of spam outright, while Love's organization is on the verge of
recommending spam labeling legislation to the US Congress. Go to
www.braintennis.com to take a look.
