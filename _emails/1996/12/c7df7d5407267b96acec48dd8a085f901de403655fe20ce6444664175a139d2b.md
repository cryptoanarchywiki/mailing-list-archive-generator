Yeah, those assholes are getting in the way of my first amendment 
right to spam the fuck out of anyone and everyone I fucking want 
to!!!!  

My hero, Larry Flint, says "The price of freedom of speech is

immediately!  No one would even know it was spam, or a spamming 
robot!!!

cc:ing this to a couple others who helped me write the "link 
following" web-robot I am currently using!  Let's get on this usenet 
thing NOW!!!!
