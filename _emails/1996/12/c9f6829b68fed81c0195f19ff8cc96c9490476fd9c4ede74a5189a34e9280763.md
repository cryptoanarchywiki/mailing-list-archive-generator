-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The new PGP Public Key Server which has been running on pgp.ai.mit.edu
for the past several months is now available as a beta release.  

This is the first public release of the code, and while it has proven
mostly reliable, it is not guaranteed to be perfect.  Because it uses
hash tables and balanced trees instead of a flat file format, it
trades a disk space for a substantial performance improvement over the
old pgp-based key server.

The PGP Public Key Server home page can be found at
<http://www.mit.edu/people/marc/pks/>.  This page contains links to
the sources, the server running on pgp.ai.mit.edu, and my thesis,
which documents the specification and design of the key server.

If you have any problems, questions, or comments, I read
comp.security.pgp.tech.  That's probably the best forum for discussion
and questions, but you can send me email, too.

In order to have an idea how how many people are using this key
server, if you install it, for public use or not, please let me know.
