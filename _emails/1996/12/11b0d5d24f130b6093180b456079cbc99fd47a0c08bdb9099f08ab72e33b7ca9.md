  In Canada, farmers purportedly own their own land, but are required by
law to sell their grain only through the (collective) Canadian Wheat
Board.
  Right now, farmers are fighting this policy, and being jailed for 
attempting to sell their grain themselves, on the open market. 
  
  Why is it that governments always seem to be so self-congratulatory
about allowing the citizens to be 'free' to do those things that the
government 'allows' them to do?
  It is so comforting to know that I am 'free' to decide what color of
sand they put in the Vaseline. (I prefer black, myself)
