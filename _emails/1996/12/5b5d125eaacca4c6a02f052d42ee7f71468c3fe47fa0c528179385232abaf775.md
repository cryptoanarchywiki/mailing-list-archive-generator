It seems to me the government wouldn't like it because someone else (the real
owner of the SS#) would be getting the $$$. It is also fraud because this is
how the government keeps track of your workplace. Giving a wrong ss# would
lead the government to believe that person with that ss# is working two jobs
and only paying the taxes in april for one job.
