Maybe they were just too busy sifting through your irrelevant bullshit.

(And to continue the irrelevancies, so you can maybe see a bit of the irony of all this garbage you tend to keep sending despite pleas and flames, try checking your subject line if you are going to bitch about others' spelling. Adverbs need an "ly," and you should drop the "e.")
