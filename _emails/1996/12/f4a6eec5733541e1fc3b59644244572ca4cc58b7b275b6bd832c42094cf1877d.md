Dear 'Uncle Rob',
  I don't know what kind of sick pervert you are, but I have contacted
my service provider, and they are contacting 'your' service provider,
as well as the FBI and the FCC.
  Don't bother replying to this email, as my service provider is
blocking
all of your mailings, forthwith, to this service.  They will be seeing
to it that filth purveyors such as yourself are banished from the WWW.

You Sick Bastard,
BRD
