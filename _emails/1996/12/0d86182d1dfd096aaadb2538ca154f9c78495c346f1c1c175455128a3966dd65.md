The logical implication here is that a thousand people "getting together"
and doing something is no different in principle than one person doing
that something.  Not a valid implication, although the result is not
necessarily false on a per-case basis.

Ironically, discrimination, prejudice, bigotry, hate, etc. are often
judged by the public on a "gut level" as well.  It's just a matter of
how to "educate" the public to see these things.
