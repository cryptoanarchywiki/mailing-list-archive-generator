This is the message I got in response to my post regarding Mr. May's
offensive, racist, and bigoted post about ebonics.   I have made
overtures towards peace and tried to explain that I thought that the
Doctor's verbal slapping was not as bad as it seemed, maybe even he
deserved it!.  He refuses to answer.  He's just a pussy, I guess. 
Like's to make terroristic threats.  To Nam vets, yet.  Ballsy, Tim!

	In some areas of the country showing someone your middle finger is the
	universal hand signal for "shoot me".  If you are carrying a gun and
give
	such a hand signal you likely to be held at fault if the shooting does
start.
	If you choose to carry, you will be held to a higher standard of
behavior
	than those that don't.
