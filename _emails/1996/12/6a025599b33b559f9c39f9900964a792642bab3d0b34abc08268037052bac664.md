I believe the above paragraph could be the key to why a lot of argument
goes on unnecessarily - an economic model/theory may be a good one, but
is muddied by existing practice/legislation, i.e., the homeless are dis-
advantaged insofar as ID, address, credit and so on, which does not say
so much about the economic model as it does that the model is perturbed
by existing real-world compromises.
