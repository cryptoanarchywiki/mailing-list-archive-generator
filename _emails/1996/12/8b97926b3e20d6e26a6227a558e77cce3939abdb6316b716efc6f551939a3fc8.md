Ross, let's write a good Usenet spambot. The ones out there suck because
they go through newsgroups alphabetically and post the same crap all at
once. Then they get detected and cancelled by assholes like Chris Lewis.

A good spambot would cover all unmoderated newsgroups, look for traffic,
pretend to follow up on postings from actual people, say something on-topic,
and post your message, but vary it randomly, so it's almost never the same.

I think we can make a pretty good program. "Cypher punks" don't write code,
but we do.
