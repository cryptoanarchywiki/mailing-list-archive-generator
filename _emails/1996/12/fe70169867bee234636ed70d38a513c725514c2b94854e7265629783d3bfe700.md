You obviously (deliberately?) are misrepresenting May's comment above.  It 
isn't that some kinds of evil are "no big deal":  It's that quantiatively, 
refusing to accept a solution that would prevent, say, 100 deaths, simply 
because it would cause _one_ DIFFERENT death is foolish and misguided.  

If you feel inclined to deny this, consider the reverse situation:  Would 
you approve of the saving of one life if it cost 100 lives?  (all things 
being equal.)  While most people would feel uncomfortable being asked to 
make decisions of this kind, that does not mean that one outcome is not 
identifiably better than another.
