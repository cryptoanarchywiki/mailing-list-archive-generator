First, because it's King John "Lackbrain" Gilmore's company. :-)

Second, because they hire unqualified people (rather, people whose
qualifications have nothing to do with the job) and they've already
fucked up every project they've ever touched.

Third, because they steal from the people who originally developed the
free software by charging money for the non-existent "support".

I'm quite happy with MS VC++ for NT. I doubt that Cygnus can do a good job
porting gcc to NT. People much better than the assholes at Cygnus have not
done a great job porting gcc to OS/2. If I want gcc, I just run it on the
Linux box, or a Sun box.

Fuck Cygnus.
