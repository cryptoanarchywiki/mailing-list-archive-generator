 "U.S. Will Modestly Revise Encryption Exports Rule"
 
 The Administration will modestly revise controversial 
 export rules for computer encoding technology after a 
 private meeting Wednesday with computer and 
 telecommunications companies, Reinsch said after the 
 hour and a half long meeting. Industry officials argued at 
 the meeting that the draft rules were unclear or unworkable 
 on a number of points. BSA said, "We are not optimistic that 
 these rules will be turned around and we feel going to 
 Congress is our only option."


 "Industry Gears Up To Oppose Newest Encryption Plan"

 Opposition is mounting to the newest draft plan floated Mon. 
 by the Administration. One company representative called 
 the plan "policy extortion." Until now, most opposition has 
 come from software industry; some hardware  companies 
 are now starting to edge away.

 One rule appeared to expand types of communications 
 subject to key system, noting that rule said that products 
 referred to text of "encrypted data and communications." 
 That could be interpreted as e-mail. The document 
 showed that law enforcement agencies had the upper 
 hand.
