Except that it isn't clear that there are any enforceable "rules," 
particularly after the Patel decision.

You've stated a position, but you haven't supported it.  It's the position 
you might expect the government to take, given its past behavior, but it 
isn't yet clear that this is the case.

Even if, arguably, once-imported software becomes subject to ITAR, it is by 
no means clear that a "signature" is in any way controlled by ITAR.  After 
all, looked at generously, the "signature" might simply be a plaque or paper 
certificate, saying "this is wonderful software!"

Remember, no matter how long that signature it, it might just happen to be 
the same string as a compressed bit of data from some other source, etc.    
The signature might be 16 bits long, for all we know.

In short, the "you can't export signatures" is simply more steps removed 
from the "you can't export crypto software."  We have yet to see anybody 
attempt to enforce this.
