1) We do not care about computer laws. At all.
2) We just do not like mime UUENCODE is ok to send files,and we (at least i)
consider MIME almost useless and annoying - MIMEish sendmails often encode 
russian text (8th bit set) just because they think it's kosher. I don't think
so and there are still many people with MIME-unaware readers who get highly
annoyed when they see mime crap instead of plain text. BTW i've seen only one
REALLY mime-aware MUA,the Pine,others (incl elm) often work with national
codesets.. hmm.. i can' say incorrectly but when it forgets to decode header of 
message..
