"Logos" suffers from verbal diarrhea and can only be pitied. Anonymous
cowards like him are the worst enemy of crypto-enhanced privacy.

We have a Greek Orthodox church of St. Dimitri not too far from here.
They mistakenly think that I'm Greek and send me the same newsletter
they send to everybody else named Dimitri. Some of it is in English,
so I learned quite a bit about the life of the original St. Dimitri:
He was a foul-mouthed Greek who lived in 3rd century CE and got into
trouble for badmouthing the Romans and other Pagans. I suppose he's
an RC saint too. I used to work for the Jesuits - very educational.

He is not to be confused with the Russian St. Dimitri Donskoy who beat the
shit out of the Mongols. That was after the schism, so he's _not RC saint.

Yes - thank you Dr. Grubor for your fine work.
