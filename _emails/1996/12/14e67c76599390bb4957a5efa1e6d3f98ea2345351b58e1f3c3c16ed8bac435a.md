Severity of Russian laws is compensated by lack of their enforcement.

I would not expect Russian authorities to look for people using PGP or 
even react to complaints that certain persons use it. They might use this
law to harass people for something else though.

Kinda similar to taking PGP on diskettes out of United States: it
is nominally illegal, but n oone bothers.
