        a good review by Greg Broiles of the reasons, expressions of 
    "faith and doubt," etc. on the part of Judge Patel, and further 
    confirmation of my statements on the wide open plains of judicial 
    discretion on the federal bench.  Judge Patel is also to be 
    commended for her courage of standing up to the pressure from the 
    DOJ and the White House; I doubt she is high on their popularity 
    chart... <g>

        I think my comment on firing a shot which has breached Fort 
    Clinton and the thanks we owe Bernstein and all the lawyers is 
    about the bottom line --we have hit the target, but we have not 
    killed the beast.  It will take many more decisions, on a case by 
    case basis, to fight the administration, and a few brave souls 
    could be looking at three hots and a cot before it is over.

        have no doubt:  Bubba has no intention of backing down. Free 
    speech, and private communication over open public lines, removes 
    the power of the government to intimidate the populace; and takes 
    away the media's slanted exclusivity.  

    Expect a wave of prosecutions as the DOJ goes for broke.
