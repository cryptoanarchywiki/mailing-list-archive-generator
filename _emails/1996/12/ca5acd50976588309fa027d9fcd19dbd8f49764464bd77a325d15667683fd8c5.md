	Of course redlining causes harm to those who are redlined... they
can't get credit. But the same can be said of any system of keeping
track of who is likely to repay credit; it means that someone who has
defaulted on past loans won't get future ones. Quite simply, while I
would agree with you that racism certainly persists (it would be
difficult for me to grow up in the South and not see this), I would
argue that you have no evidence for that the basic motivation behind
redlining is that the people in such areas are less likely to repay
credit.
