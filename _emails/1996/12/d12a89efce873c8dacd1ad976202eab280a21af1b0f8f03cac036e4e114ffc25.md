Thanks for an interesting reply.

Do we consider discrimination based on poverty illegitimate?

Does the law consider discrimination based on poverty illegitimate?

I think that most people would answer no to both of these questions.

As I said in another letter, correlation, to me, is not an evidence
of discrimination, and just as well, making statements about averages is
not racist or sexist.

It is the cross-section test that evidences discrimination: suppose
we have two large groups with the same credit-related parameters
(credit history, etc). If one group gets better treatment from a
bank, I see a discrimination.

I do not see much problem if the percentage of whites with good credit
is higher than percentage of blacks with good credit: it is a fact of
life.

The crucial question is: do we believe that the characteristic
that we are considering directly linked with future performance?

This is a valid concern.
