I heard an almost identical story from a security guard at DEFCON IV last
july in Las Vegas.  He said it happened in the hotel where he was working
(not the Monte Carlo, which had just opened) in 1995.  The management
managed to cover the event up and it never, according to him, appeared in
the local papers.
