Though I have some suspicions that "Logos" is someone I know in Real Life,
I've come to think he's as bad for the list as Vulis, Grubor, and the
others are.

His "superficial decorum" does not hide a deeper viciousness and cluelessness.

Fatuous nonsense. The "attacks" Vulis refers to were satirical. This has
been lost in the Noise of the Big Lie.

Logos is now the 17th resident of my Eudora filter file.

P.S. I certainly hope this "Logos" nym is not who I suspect it is, as this
will surely end our Real World friendship. A fucking bozo.


Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
