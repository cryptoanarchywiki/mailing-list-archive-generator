Dave is assuming facts not in evidence.  His meaning was 
transparently obvious.  My comment was merely the /reducto ad
absurdum/ of his statement.  Dave's "insight" is not profound,
merely shallow and specious.  Sort of like "Deep Thoughts" on
Saturday Night Live--"Without night, there can be no day."
(Whoa man, that's SO heavy!)
