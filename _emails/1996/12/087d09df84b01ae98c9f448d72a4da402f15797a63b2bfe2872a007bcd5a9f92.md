The piece was commissioned in early summer.  It was originally
slated to run in the fall.  For one reason or another it kept
getting pushed back and only just not made it to the light of
day.

Att the time I wrote and submitted the article I neither worked 
for Sameer, nor had I applied for a position, nor was I being 
considered for one (at least, not to my knowledge).  When I went 
to work for Sameer, but before the article was published, I 
informed my editor of the possible APPEARANCE of a conflict of 
interest.  He did not have a problem with it.
