I note that along with this racist generalisation you decided to post the 
following rant:

>As usual, Timmy May spouts racist, anti-Semitic shit. As usual, he has
>no idea what he's talking about. So what else is new...

As well as a number of other rants along those lines. There is little 
difference between over generalisations of the kind you made above 
and, for example, discriminating against someone on the basis of 
race, colour, religion etc.
