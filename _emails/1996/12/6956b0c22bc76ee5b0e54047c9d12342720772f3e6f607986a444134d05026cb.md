What's next?  If Timmy doesn't like what I write will I be kicked off 
like the Doctor?  Wow!  From Timmy's trash bin to Kook of the Month 
FAME!!!!!  What more could I ask for?  Fuck You, Too, Timmy!  But I 
refuse to censor my own input, so I'll still have to see your fucking 
stuff.  ShitHead.  Hostile Agent!

How come it took over a year to get this far?
