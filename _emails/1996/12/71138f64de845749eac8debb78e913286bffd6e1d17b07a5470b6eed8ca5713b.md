Saying "just call the police" strikes me as being one of the most absurd
things I've ever heard on this list.

(If I receive a "Logos-gram" warning me I am being unpolite, you know where
it'll go.)

99.7% of all local police departments will say, "Huh?" Then they will ask
what an "IP" is, then they will advise the caller to deal with it in civil
court, and hang up.

Most police departments seem to have a hard time using their 8086-based PCs
to run WordPerfect, and have almost no contact with the Internet.

If your local cops are prepared to deal with a subtle attack involing IP
pings, or whatever, they all I can say is that you must live in the nerd
capital of the world....actually, I thought Silicon Valley was that place,
and I know for sure that the local police aren't prepared to handle obscure
attacks.
