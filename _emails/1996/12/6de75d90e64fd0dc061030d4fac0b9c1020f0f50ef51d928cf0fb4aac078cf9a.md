Paul Bradley packs so many lies into 30 lines of text, it's almost remarkable.

First, I don't post rants about "Sovok Jews" to cypherpunks. Paul lies.
(I happen to be Jewish, which is one of the reasons why Tim May hates my guts.)


Second, Paul Bradley's own words do more to expose his own ignorance and
stupidity than anything anyone else could say about him. This is my article
which immediately preceded John Gilmore's shameful act of censorship:

Paul Bradley spoke about OTP, not stream cyphers. He lies.


Third, Paul lies about his "opposition" to John Gilmore's censorship.
Here is an e-mail Paul sent to the non-existent address "dvl" in
response to an anonymous article on cypherpunks:

<stupid sig snipped>

It's clear that Paul supported John's "removal" of me from the list.

Paul Bradley sent me dozens of hate e-mails. When he started mailbombing
me with multiples copies of my own cypherpunks postings with obscenities
appended, I set up a filter to bounce his junk back to him. Paul appears
to be obsessed with me.

Behold the collected works of Paul Bradley before the bouncer was set up:
