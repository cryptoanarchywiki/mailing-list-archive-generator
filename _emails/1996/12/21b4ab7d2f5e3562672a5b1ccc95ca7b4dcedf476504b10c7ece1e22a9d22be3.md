While this will, of course, be obvious to those frequenting CP, notice a 
curious fact here:  The commentary above refers to the organization as a 
"Key Recovery Alliance."  Well, one might normally expect that organizations 
are usually named based on their primary raison d'etre.  Yet, the objectives 
listed above clearly do not require, or even desire, "Key Recovery."  Quite 
the opposite, in fact.  If there was any need to demonstrate the 
illegitimacy of this  arrangement to the press or public, you need merely 
show that the people and organizations participating in it don't even 
consider the goal implicit in the name to be a desireable outcome.
