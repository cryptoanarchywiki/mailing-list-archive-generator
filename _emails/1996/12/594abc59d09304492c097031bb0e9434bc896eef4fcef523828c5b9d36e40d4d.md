I think that legally, if someone who is simply slapped in the face and
is feeling no danger to his life (ie, if the slap is sort of theatrical
and it is obvious) shoots the slapper, he may be charged with some sort
of crime. I would appreciate if lawyers on this list commented on
whether shooting is or is not appropriate in this case.
