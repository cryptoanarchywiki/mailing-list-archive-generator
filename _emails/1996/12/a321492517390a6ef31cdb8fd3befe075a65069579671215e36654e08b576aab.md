Here you mindlessly repeat Ray Arachelian's lies. Have you no mind of your own?
Why am I your "enemy"? Why do you think you're important enough for me to give
a fuck?

"Cypher punks" write stupid racist flames and postmaster complaints, not code.

I am not "here" - I've been unsubscribed by the head censor, cocksucker
John Gilmore at the request of Ray Arachelian and Timmy May. They're
"here" to harrass and to flame and they don't want followups from the
victims of their harrassment.

Freedom for whom, or from whom? I have no great despect for Abraham
"I freed who?" Lincoln, but I like the quote from him: "Those who deny
freedom to others deserve it not for themselves."

Some folks on this mailing list remind me of hardcore communists that
believe that orthodix marxism works, and everyone who tried and failed
to implement it, was perverting marx's ideas. U.S.constitution was an
instrument of class warfare.

Yes, let's see some more "dissidents" unsubscribed! Let's see some more
mailbombs and postmaster complaints! Let's see punitive action in response
to speech! That's all "cypher punks" are good for.
