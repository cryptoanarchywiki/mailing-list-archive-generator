Again, as a statistical exercise, this might be OK, but, quite a bit of
what you would see in the exceptional areas of the curve in childhood
would be rather obvious in adulthood as well. The fact that this doesn't
seem so obvious across the statistical curve is only evidence of poor
granularity in the data.

A typical researcher or team of same would not be proper candidates to
lead an interventionist study such as this.  You'd need people with
proven track records.  As I keep telling my wife again and again, when
we go into a book store and she picks up some book on a "health" topic:
What's the author's track record, not only for him/herself, but in
leading others?

It's just that in my personal experience, I've found that the vast
majority of children fall into the category of "exceptional potential".
I guess what I'm saying is that the accomplishment/test norms for most
children are far enough below where I could get them to with personal
attention, that  1) The norms are useful (to me) only as a stasticical
exercise, and  2) The differences between typical children and typical
children performing at or near their potential obscures the differences
found amongst the norms.

This is, I believe, what I and others feared from studies which provide
material for books such as the Bell Curve.  Knowing that the potential
of an allegedly unintelligent (or less-than-average) child might be so
great that that child (if lucky enough to get the opportunity) could
actually develop to be a significantly better performer than another
child with 40 more IQ points, even if the child with the higher IQ has
a reasonably good environment to develop in. Those kinds of possibilities
are (I think) near and dear to what some of our more enlightened founding
fathers in the USA had in mind when they wrote what they did, way back when.

I value the writings of all philosophers, BTW, but I reject the notions
of any that I or any other autonomous individual (a human is more-or-less
autonomous by definition, yes?) could be defined, limited, or otherwise
constrained by studies such as we've discussed.  I say constrained since
these studies do not happen in a vaccuum, and there is always going to be
some kind of fallout.
