I believe it can be.  Until a few years ago, it was common to request
a credit card AND TO RECORD THE NUMBER ON THE CHECK.  Legislation was
enacted (this might have been just in California, I'm not sure) to
prevent them from recording the number, but I believe it specifically
allowed them to continue to ask to see that you have a card (they
shouldn't need to see the number, so I believe you are within your
rights to, say, obscure it with your thumb).

Of course, they are (and should not be) under any obligation to accept
your check in the first place, so I would think the ID they request
would be up to them.
