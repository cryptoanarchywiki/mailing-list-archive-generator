I spent part of my growing up years in Leroy West Virginia, pop. about
15, give or take.  I know about hillbillies, and I know about guns.

If you had the impression I am a whiner, or that that defines me as a
person, you're about as clueful as the other old farts who attack people
they don't know anything about.  Note I said if, in case you decide to
repent sometime...

By the way, did you think that part about people supporting licensing
was pretty scary?  You know, people who are pretty well off don't like
to live in fear of gangs and stuff like that, and since those people
who have most of the money also have most of the power, it seems to me
they could pull it off. Now, you might be able to hide for a while if
you're clever enough and lucky enough, but I think some of them rich
folk gonna wanna trade some of their fear for some of yours, if you know
what I mean, and I think you do.
