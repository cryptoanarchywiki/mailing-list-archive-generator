I reqiure assistance in obtaining my internet explorer connection.  I
made an error while deleting cache, history and temp files which somehow
prevents me from hooking up to Microsoft's Explorer.

In the control panel I attempt to click on the Internet Icon and the
following occurs:  A Content Advisor box appears and states the
following:  Content advisor configuration information is missing. 
Someone may have tried to tamper with it.  Check content Advisor
Settings.  End of quote.  In the internet properties box, I tried to
look for what they recommended but was not sure what to look for.

I have the Windows 95 disk.  Could you please advise accordingly.
P.S. Netscape works fine.  I previously had Internet Explorer woking
before I cleaned house.

Thanks...
