Be especially carefully of structuring a $10,000+ transaction into 
smaller transactions in an attempt to circumvent the reporting 
requirements.  Doing so ("structuring a transaction") is a felony.

I was involved in reviewing a matter for possible prosecution in my 
former life.  Guy wins big football pool (season long) -- total of 
$27,000.  He calls an *leaves a message* that he wants 3 $9,000 checks.  
He gets them, goes to branch 1 of bank x and cashes one.  Then to branch 2 
and cashes another.  Then back to branch 1 for the third.

The bank, as required, filed a Report of Suspcious Transaction.  
Fortunately for him, the IRS-CID agents jumped the gun and alerted him to 
the investigation (by interviewing him) before he filed his taxes for 
that year.  He then knew enough to report the income and pay the taxes.

We settled the matter by having the money forfeited and having a civil 
monetary penalty assessment against him under the Bank Secrecy Act (the 
first such penalty against an individual ever).  He got credit on the 
civil assessment for the money forfeited, so all he lost was his $27,000 
in winnings.

Had he been better at it, he never would've been caught, IMNSHO.
