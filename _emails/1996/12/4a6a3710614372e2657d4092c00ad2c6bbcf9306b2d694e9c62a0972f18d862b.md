There is an ad-hoc group of government representatives (called an
"expert group" actually) working on an OECD set of cryptography policy
guidelines.

They have a big five day meeting coming up starting 12 December in
Paris.

A September draft of their guidelines was leaked and put on a WWW 
site in Austria: 

   http://www.quintessenz.at/Netzteil/OECD/index.html 

as a Word 6 file.

I got it, turned it into HTML and put it on my site with comments.

   http://www.ozemail.com.au/~firstpr

Recently, someone from the OECD crypto secretariat emailed me 
indicating they had read my comments and found them reasonably 
constructive.

I have since added more comments, which I emailed to the secretariate
person.  If anyone has something constructive to convey to them, email
me and I will put you in touch with them.

I understand there will be an article on the debate in the next 
weekly edition of The European newspaper.

The people at Quintessenz apparently have a later draft which they are
scanning and will put up on their site ASAP.
