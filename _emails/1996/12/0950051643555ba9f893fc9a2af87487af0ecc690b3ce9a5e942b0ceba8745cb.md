The dec96 issue of _cause for alarm_ has hit the web.
You can get to it via the home page, at:

http://www.teleport.com/~richieb/cause/

_cause for alarm_ is a zine which explores threats to
freedom of speech, as well as other online freedoms.

This month's features focus on the persecution of
Bernie S, and the landmark Bernstein v US Department
of State crypto case.

Past topics have included a primer on starting local
activist groups, Intel's hosing of Perl wizard Randal
Schwartz, and the Church of Scientology. Also, interviews
with prominent Net activists.

I'm seeking contributions for future issues. If you'd
like more info, point your web browser at:

Or send email to richieb@teleport.com with the words
"submission guidelines" (without the quotes) in the
subject line of your message.
