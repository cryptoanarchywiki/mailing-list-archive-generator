I wish Iraqi people the best of luck in killing every American they can get
their hands on. Three cheers for Saddam Hussein!

You are sadly mistaken, child, or maybe you believe the lies Timmy May (fart)
spread about me. I am a professional cryptographer. I believe that crypto
technology should be freely availably to everyone, with no government controls,
like any other technology (like compiler construction :-). I believe that the
Internet should be available to everyone (and I've made a lot of enemies by
helping connect certain parts of the world to the 'net somewhat sooner that
they would have been without my participation). OTOH, "cypher punks" are a
joke, a laughing stock for the media, who stand in the way of these goals.
Re-read the list archives before speaking of things you do not understand.
