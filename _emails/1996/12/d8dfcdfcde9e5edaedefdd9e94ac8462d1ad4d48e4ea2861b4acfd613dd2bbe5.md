12-21-96:

"In Encryption Politics, Some Good News for Bankers"

  "Everyone knows that DES is not enough," said Perry Metzger. 
  This dispute places the banking and financial services community 
  squarely in opposition to government intelligence agencies with 
  which it has historically worked hand in hand on security matters.
  "The Feds won't realize export controls don't work even after the
  dried, strangled corpse of the U.S. security software industry is
  laid before the Congress," Mr. Metzger said. "They will leave the
  manacles on the corpse long after it is obvious that the body isn't
  going anywhere."

"Central Banks' Task Force Sees No Need for Alarm"

  While the security architectures of most electronic money
  systems share many design features, a wide range of options is
  available to product developers in terms of specific chip-card
  security measures, cryptographic algorithms, key lengths, and
  transaction monitoring.

"SPA Voices Concerns Over Clinton Encryption Policy"

  In a letter last week to Vice President Al Gore, SPA raised
  several concerns that the software industry has with the
  administration's interim rules on encryption policy.

"NSA/ On The Costs of Anonymity"

  "How to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of  Anonymous Electronic 
  Cash" has been making the rounds of the electronic money community. 
  It raises security and law enforcement concerns about anonymous 
  systems designed like Digicash Inc.'s Ecash.
