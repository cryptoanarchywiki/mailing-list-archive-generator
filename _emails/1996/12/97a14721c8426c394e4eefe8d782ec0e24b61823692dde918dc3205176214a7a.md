	Given exactly how big the Internet is for free speech, I'd call this
government interference in speech from those with a viewpoint in opposition
to its. I can see some restraints on speech in prison itself... but not
on someone who is supposedly safe enough to be let out, even under
supervision. (I would also point out that this ties into the action of drug
laws to cause the disenfranchisement of felony drug offenders. I see no
reason to suppose that felony drug offenders (as with any other crime that
shouldn't be one) would be any less competent to vote than the average,
everyday person (otherwise known as the average idiot)).
