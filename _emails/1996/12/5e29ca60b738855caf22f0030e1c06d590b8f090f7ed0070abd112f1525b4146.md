The NSA-hosted National Information Systems Security
Conference, held in October, 1996, has made a wide
range of papers available (in PDF format), and listed in:

  http://csrc.nist.gov/nissc/1996/papers/NISSC/toc.pdf (110kb)

One panel's papers eye all-optical networks and security, 
including optical encryption, which NSA appears to be leading:

  http://csrc.nist.gov/nissc/1996/papers/NISSC/paper236/

Many others -- long and short, informative and fatuous -- 
address sizzling and old-grease sec issues -- techie, 
lawless, bad-hair-brained.

Several archists cry cyber crime and plead for vigilance 
for on-line anarcho-ebonics:

"Industrial Espionage Today and Information Wars Tomorrow."

"Rise of the Mobile State: Organized Crime in the 21st Century."

"Ethical and Responsible Behavior for Children to Senior
Citizens in the Information Age."

"Monitoring Your Employees: How Much Can You Do and What
Should You Do When You Uncover Wrongdoing?"

Despite such blow, there's much other solid reading. Take a nap 
while the PDFs glaciate in.
