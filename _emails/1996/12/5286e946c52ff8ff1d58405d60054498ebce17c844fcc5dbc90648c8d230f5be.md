This may be true if the second identity runs concurrently with the first,
but if you really need a new identity, such as govt. provides in the
"witness protection" programs, get some of the books through the
"underground" mailorder distributors.  Books such as The Heavy Duty
New Identity, or How To Disappear And Never Be Found.

I can provide the names of the mailorder companies if you wish.
The books average $15 to $30, and I can't vouch for the content.

For cross referencing and verification, you could also purchase the
antithesis types, i.e., How To Find Anybody (etc.) by Ted Gunderson
et al.
