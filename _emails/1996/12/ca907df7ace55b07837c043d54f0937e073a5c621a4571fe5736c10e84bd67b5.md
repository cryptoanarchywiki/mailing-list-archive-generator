I have personal experience with cases where the lender (actually the
company which bought the loan) misrepresented a loan default
apparently in order to get reimbursed by the government.  The
government requires the lenders to make a certain number of contacts
with the borrower before declaring a default.  In this case, the
lender simply lied about the contacts.  Payments had been interrupted
as a consequence of confusion relating to the change in procedure when
the loan was sold.  One presumes that this was not accidental and that
somebody had a roaring little business going.

I have no trouble believing that the student loan market would quickly
dry up were the government to get out of the business.
