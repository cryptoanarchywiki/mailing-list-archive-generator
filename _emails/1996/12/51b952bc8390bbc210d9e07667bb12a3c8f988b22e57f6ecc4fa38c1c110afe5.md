Even better than exporting the hacked advapi32.dll, compare the it 
with the original one.  I'd bet good money that the only difference is
the contents of the RC_DATA/#102 resource attached to the image.
(It's useful to note that the advapi32.dll from versions of NT before
CryptoAPI doesn't have any RC_DATA resources.)

And to think MS was good enough to provide an UpdateResource 
API that I haven't yet had a good reason to use.

Nope, a little experimentation shows you can change those entries
while the system is running to your hearts contents.  Try temporarily
renaming the signature key of the base provider.
