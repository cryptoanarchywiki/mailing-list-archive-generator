This is an unrealistic problem and a stupid situation.

It was my experience that if I go by a scary-looking group of black 
people, look into their eyes without fear and say "hi" and go further, 
they would never exhibit any sign of aggressiveness. They even get 
surprised.

This always worked for me in Russia, whenever I had to pass a group
of mobsters. I think that internal motivation for aggressive people
has something to do with sexual hormones and the need to subdue their
victims, so nothing attracts them more than exhibition of fear. I would
definitely think it is safer to actually go to the right, even if you
assume that P2 has some sinister thoughts.

Then again, personal experiences are not a good replacement for 
statistics.
