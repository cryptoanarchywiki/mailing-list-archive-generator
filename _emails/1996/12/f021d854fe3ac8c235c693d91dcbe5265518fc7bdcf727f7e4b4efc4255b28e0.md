And I think that a prosecutor who _wished_ to make an example of someone
could use the new regs to indeed go after someone who made an "investment"
in the stock of a foreign company! An investment is clearly exactly what
the regs mention.

Now, obviously, all prosecutions have _costs_, and prosecution of someone
for buying $10,000 worth of stock in a large European or Japanese company
doing frowned-upon crypto work would be unlikely...unless that person was
Phil Zimmermann or someone else the feds want zapped. But many investments
are for much larger amounts...if someone invests $200K in the stock of a
company doing frowned upon work, the government might well decide to
prosecute.

That the regs clearly give them the authority to prosecute is the key.

The essence of a terror state is that one never knows when the hammer will
fall. This "FUD" (aka "random reinforcement") keeps the sheeple in line.
