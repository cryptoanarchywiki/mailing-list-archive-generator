Yes, part of that "higher standard" is to keep your fucking mouth 
shut about that piece in your sholder holster.  Those that brag that 
they are packing and won't hesitate to use it are usually those that 
freeze under fire or snap at the workplace.

	Student:  "How about earplugs?"

	Instructor: "We've thought about that as an 
	intimidation tool.  Some guy is hassling you 
	on the street and you start putting your ear 
	plugs in.  The guy says, 'What are you doing?'  
	You say, 'It looks like I'm going to be doing 
	some shooting here pretty soon and I don't 
	want to hurt my ears.'"

(L.Detweiler used to complain about how many cyberdeaths he had
experienced.)

Outta sight, outta mind...
