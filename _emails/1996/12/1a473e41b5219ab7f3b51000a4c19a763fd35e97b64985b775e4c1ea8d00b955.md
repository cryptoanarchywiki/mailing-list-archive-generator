You and I can't. The government can. It is one thing to commit a crime (if
a crime has even been committed in the case in question). It is another
thing to find somebody willing to prosecute it.

In today's day and age, the Constitution exists for historical purposes
only. Much of it has long been abolished by the courts. The remainder is
being mostly ignored. The "Kein Kl√§ger, kein Richter" principle makes it
irrelevant if doing so is illegal.

A favorite saying of 2nd Amendment supporters is: "Which part of 'shall not
be infringed' don't you understand?"

If society doesn't care that the Constitution is being violated, the
violations will continue. And society couldn't care less.
