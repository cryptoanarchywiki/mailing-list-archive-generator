As a sidelight to this thread which has already strewn far from the 
[crypto] heading, it *is* possible to show a web page to someone w/out
letting them copy it.  Some guy in California, who touts the fact he has
"every foul word known to man" on his site (to generate more hits) has
(I believe developed/worked to help develop) a product which does so.  I
don't know how he does it, and I know there are ways around it through
sniffing, etc., but when you do the trivial act of "View Source" in 
Netscape, a filtered version is displayed in the source window.  While
it's really not possible (AFAIK) to eliminate unwanted copying by a person
who knows what they're doing, this works against people who don't (like 
most people).

If anyone's interested, I *might* be able to find the URL somewhere.
