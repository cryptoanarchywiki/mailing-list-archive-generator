Let's say each key is 2048 bits and there are 10 million processors.
That's only 2.38 gigabytes, or under $1000.  Easy enough to put on
the Web or on a set of CD-ROMs.

Yes, my working assumption is that factoring is very hard.

You have to have the "approved" message so that you don't get
viruses and to thwart piracy in case anybody did manage to get the
secret key out of the chip.

How well it goes over depends entirely on how much you pay for the
software.

And one would expect piracy-proof software to be very inexpensive.  Most
people who pay for software have little sympathy for those who don't.

Right you are - see below.

While I am certainly not a lawyer, and even the lawyers can't tell
you what is legal to export, I would guess that Big Brother would be
delighted with the manufacturers of this processor.  It can't be
used to encrypt communications, only to decrypt software.  What is
more, you could control the physical processors so that exportable
processors accept a different authentication key.

Then, the manufacturer of the processor can take care not to authenticate
any privacy enhancing programs for the export version of the processor.

Free speech and constitutional issues evaporate because the processors
are physical devices and not expressions of ideas.

Even "better", not very many organizations in the world can afford the
fab lines to manufacture a state of the art processor.  So, if the
G-7 countries are brought onto the reservation, it would be feasible
to forbid all free processors.
