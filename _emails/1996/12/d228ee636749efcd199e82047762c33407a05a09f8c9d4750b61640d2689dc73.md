I hope you don't mind my adding this to the list, but since I posted
something very pertinent several days ago and got *no* reaction, and
since it was something very significant, I wanna try it one more time:

This experience on your part, of installing 100-plus Macs with only one
needing service, is beyond amazing.  Most computer people will readily
admit that HP (for example) is the best, reliability-wise, yet I have
purchased quite a few of their computers and major peripherals over the
past 20 years, and I have experienced an approximate 40% (!) defective
rate during the one-year warranty period, more than 30% falling within
the first three months.

As to why I still use their stuff - it's because the others are worse,
a fact which is almost universally agreed on.  How can this possibly
be, you ask?  Could it be really bad luck?  No. Could it be mishandling?
No.  For a reality check, another famed electronics vendor, Sony, has
the same problem, but even worse than HP.  Unfortunately, in the Sony
case, their products don't wear well after fixing, excepting a couple
of their rather expensive "professional" series products.

I suspect that the 100-plus Apple owners don't really use the machines,
otherwise, if they were so reliable, why does Apple desperately avoid
repairing their own products, when HP has provided top-level professional
technicians (not boys in dusty back rooms of cheap-ass computer stores)
to fix their products, and done so consistently ever since the beginning
of the PC business in 1966?
