Sure, I'm a crank, and, you're an asshole.  I never said Carto was a
swell guy, but, you ignore the real facts in a case pitting the ADL
against its worst enemy.  Maybe you should real the L.A. Times once
in a while, you ignorant jerk.

Contrary to your armchair experience, stupid, I went there and saw the
people, and I've also been studying them for 10 years or so.  The gang
that took over the IHR were neo-Nazis?  Yeah, and I'm the Pope.

Like all fruitcakes, you ignore facts and wave your arms around and
fill the air with noise.  Many big-media outlets have made it clear
that Carto is the #1 enemy of the ADL et al, and, just like someone
bombed (!) the IHR in Torrance in the 1980's, they gutted the one in
Costa Mesa in 1993.

The real story is obviously over your head, which you can now go back
and stick in the sand.  And remember, don't you dare research ANYthing
about the Holocaust etc. unless you get approval from the ADL first.
The ADL, just more lying scumbags themselves, who *suppressed* Jewish
dissent during the 1930's in the U.S.  Why?  Because it was good for
business.
