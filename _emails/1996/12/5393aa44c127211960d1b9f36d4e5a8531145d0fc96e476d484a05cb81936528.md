Gack!

Here's how I would do it.  When the processor wants to update its
clock, it generates a random number and encrypts it for the trusted
time source.  The trusted time source decrypts its message to get
the random number.  It timestamps it, encrypts it, and sends it
back.

This means you can't replay old time messages to keep using your
old software.

Is it possible to have a little clock and rechargeable battery on
a chip?  If so, then this technique should be easy to use.

If not, then the processor can count the number of cycles it runs and
use that as an approximate means of deciding when to check the time.

Or, it could demand a time update every time it is power cycled.
