Does dr. Grubor read this list?  I never see any postings from him here.
Just who is this anonymous poster; does anyone know or have any idea?

This is strange.  I mean, how do you know who is a faggot?  And is this
why you all are so sexist?  Are all of the faggots so sexist?  Just what is
it about these queers that makes them hate women so much anyway?
Are they jealous of us sexy women because their boyfriends may want us?
I have been watching this for a long time here, and this is a very perplexing
situation.  Just who are these faggots who "created and run Usenet?"
Can you give me a list of names?

Yes, but just who is he?  Do you know who he really is?  With all of
you guys always posting through these "nobody" addresses, you can 
not tell who is who?  I mean, how do you know that the anonymous poster
is in "despair about not having any control over usenet?"  Maybe he does
have control.  Just who has all of the Usenet control now anyway?

Please tell the faggots to stop being so sexist.
