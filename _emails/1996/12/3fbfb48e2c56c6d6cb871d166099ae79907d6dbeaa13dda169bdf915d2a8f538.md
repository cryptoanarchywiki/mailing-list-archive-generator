Excellent point.

On the other hand, if everybody operates correctly based on their own
(non-random) experience in general the right outcomes will occur.

This is rational if the tertiary statistical evidence is unreliable.
What you are implicitly assuming is that the studies one reads were
done honestly and competently.  Yet, the chain of evidence is rather
weak.  Typically, we don't even know the people who did the study.

Given the many contradictory results obtained by social statisticians,
we have substantial evidence that there is something wrong with their
methods or their application.

Another way to judge the experts is through selected in depth studies
of their work.  I have not found the results to be encouraging.

Occasionally we may teach somebody else about something they observed
and change their mind.  This is not the same thing as proof, but it
is worthwhile.

In other cases, we may have beliefs about the integrity of our
observer.  We may believe that they will not intentionally lie.  That
means we can separate out their interpretations from the exact details
they can recall.

Even if our correct interpretation is not accepted by the observer,
that does not imply that we can learn nothing of interest.

I should make clear that I have not ruled out statistical evidence as
a tool.  We have to be aware of its limitations.

Actually, it is cheaper and easier to develop an understanding of the
reliability of anecdotal evidence.  Often we may have known the
observer for some time and be able to form theories about their
character and ability to accurately interpret what they have seen.

We can ask them what they saw on different occasions and see if we get
about the same story back.  We can think about whether the person has
intentionally lied in the past and, if so, under what circumstances.
We can ask ourselves what motivation the person might have to lie.
Is there any benefit to giving a particular story?

What needs are satisfied by the white cloaked priests of social
science?  Which of their needs are satisfied by their work?  Very few
of these people are independent.  They are often paid by people whose
interest in the truth is in question.  That means that the temptation
to fudge (and humans find ways to rationalize such actions) is very
powerful.  The people preparing the statistical studies are often
interested in the fame associated with career advancement.  None of
this is conducive to the search for truth.

I have serious doubts about these methods.  I am not a statistician,
so there is a possibility that I am simply ignorant.

However, I would expect that if these methods of determining the
accuracy of the statistics were effective, that it would be possible
to provide some sort of error analysis.

When we get a figure for the GDP we know that it is highly unlikely to
be exactly correct.  What is the probability that it is low by 10%?  I
fail to see how the figure can even be useful without this
information.

In the case of a complex study involving the measure of biases to
adjust the final conclusions, it would be most useful to discuss the
probability that the bias was not measured correctly.  This must
surely affect our final results, especially when many biases and other
measurements are combined.
