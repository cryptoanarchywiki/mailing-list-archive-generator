  I think maybe 'limped' around your traps would be a better description.

  Does this not 'ring a bell' that suggests how 'they' know when you're
"not looking?" (Buy a clue!)

  So that I won't get 1,000 spammed messages from your list?  What a
brilliant idea, setting up your system so that any idiot with a
Commodore 64 and 256k of ram can't use your system to spam the world.

  The mailbot problems are 'warts'.  I think you need to check for
'cancer'.
