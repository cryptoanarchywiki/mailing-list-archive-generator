The following came from another mailing list.
An interesting Cypherpunks opportunity is that it appears to provide
a general broadcasting capability, depending on what authentication methods
(if any) it's using.  Aside from the fun of automatic-upgrade software,
it's a great opportunity for a media hack.  Maybe it won't be widely
supported by April 1, 1996, but it certainly should be by April 1, 1997.
(Hmmm - isn't X-Day in 1997?)  I assume it either runs UDP or runs
http to poll.
