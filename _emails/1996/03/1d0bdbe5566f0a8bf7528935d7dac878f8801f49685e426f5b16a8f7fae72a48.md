Professor Froomkin is right (IMO) but I think that the way he puts
this understates the size of the margin when it comes to cryptokeys.

If I were a US Attorney, I would bide my time and pick a hard case,
involving lots of potentially incriminating (and therefore tempting)
encrypted files, an available key, and (at least) two horsemen. The
unavailability of the key can then be presented as a "technicality,"
allowing a bad guy to possibly get off. After I get some precedent
it can then be streched over those inconvenient provisions in the
Bill of Rights. This is how "hard cases make bad law."

I agree, but if I were sitting at Anguilla's side of the table (I
won't be, and I have no idea what they will do) this point would
be a *very* expensive one. Anguilla and other tax-haven countries
have little to gain and much to lose by becoming less friendly to
the financial privacy of the Vince Cates of this world.
