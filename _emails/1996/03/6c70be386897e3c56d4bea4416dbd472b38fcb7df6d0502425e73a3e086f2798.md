I was driving on the Foothill Expressway in Palo Alto today when
I came to a stop at a light. I glanced over at the car next to me 
and noticed that someone had left thier keys in the door lock. 
 So being the good cypherpunk that I am I jumped out and grabbed the 
keys from the lock, then knocked on the window. The passenger rolled 
down the window and accepted the keys back. Much to my surprise the 
passenger was none other than Whitfield Diffie.
 Very goofily I exclaimed, "aren't you Whifield Diffie!?". "Yes, who 
are you", was the reply. "I'm a cypherpunk", I retorted. I'm not 
sure his exact reply by I think it was along the "excellent" lines. 
I got handshakes from he and his driver.
