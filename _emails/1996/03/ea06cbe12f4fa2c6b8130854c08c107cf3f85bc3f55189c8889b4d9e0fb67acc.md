I've just had a chance to go through the SDK MS is giving away for their
ActiveX package. Interestingly, there's a little utility included for
generating X.509 certs. The read.me that is included claims that the certs
so generated don't have any real validity, as they're not linked to anything
in the known universe (paraphrasing :-).

My question is, is this an otherwise usable cert? I'll be happy to give
anyone interested a copy of the files (shellback.cer and shellback.spc) I
generated, if they'd like to examine/validate them.

If the certs are, in fact, valid, I'll be glad to make the program available
to others for 'testing purposes'.
