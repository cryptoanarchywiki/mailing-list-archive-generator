I think this is a very important area to consider, and I thank Tim for
putting his thoughts into this very organized form.  My replies:

Unfortunately, this is not an option.  Legislation will happen, with our
endorsement or without it.  One good example is the Grassley computer
crime bill earlier in 1995.  Nobody advised him on this, as far as I can
tell, he just went out and drafted it.  Lo and behold, he drafted a
provision that basically criminalized all crypto, including rot13.

We have to wake up and learn from the fight against the net censorship
legislation.  This is realpolitik.  Congress will legislate crypto,
whether we want them to or not.  This is not news anyone wants to hear,
but we have to face up to it.

Congress has discovered the net, and partly though the widespread fame
of this list, they have also discovered crypto.  Simply saying, "we don't
want any laws that address crypto" may be the ideal solution, but that won't
stop them from passing laws that govern the domestic use of crypto.

Unfortunately, many U.S. software companies don't agree with you.
While I agree with you (I've got PGP, what's the problem?), several of
these companies are working through their trade organizations to introduce
and push crypto legislation to allow them to raise the key length in their
products.

Put ourselves in their shoes for a minute.  They're sitting there, with
their 40 bit products, knowing that it blows chunks.  They want to
produce stronger crypto, but know they won't be able to export it.
They talk to the company's attorneys, who speak to speak to the
lobbyists, and poof, a crypto bill.

This is actually very important.  The Leahy bill forces Joe's Key
Warehouse to only divulge your key when they've been presented with a
warrant that's on par with whatever they used to get your original
communication.  That means that Louis Freeh can't issue an
administrative subpoena to get your key, after he's got a judge to
allow the FBI to search your house.  They have to get a judge involved
for both parts.

It's better than where we are today, where Joe's Key Warehouse is vulnerable
to every law enforcement joker that can write an administrative subpoena.  We
haven't yet had an incident that demonstrates this, but we will.

Of course, if you're the sort of person who thinks that the FBI and the
Department of Justice are involved in a big criminal conspiracy to begin
with, we shouldn't even be talking about due process, as you don't believe
it exists...

I think this indeed is what Leahy was aiming for.  A quick glance at the
bill will prove this out.  The approach that "things are fine as they are"
is like saying "I'm on a freight train, heading for a cliff, but they're
still serving me caviar so it's OK".

Sure, it feels ok, but the train's still moving, no matter how far you are
into your denial. 

I can't say this enough: the net has moved into realpolitik.  Congress
has found us, and their first step is to regulate us.  Then, they'll outlaw
us.  Let's hope we convert enough legislators to netizens before they outlaw
us.
