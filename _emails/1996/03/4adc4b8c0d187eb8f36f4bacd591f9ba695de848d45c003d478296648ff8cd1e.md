Arrgghh!!! That defeats the whole purpose of the library, which is to provide a
standard interface to many different algorithms.  If you use the routine the
way it's meant to be used (via initCryptContext(), etc) it'll work fine.
 
BTW the reason it isn't encrypting is that by the looks of it you're not
calling the IDEA key schedule code.
