	Unfortunately, AltaVista doesn't index based on comments field (in
which category the SafeSurf ratings fall). Opentext, given that one supposedly
can search for links to a page, may be able to do it on the other hand.
Putting together a web spider that would search for such could be a profitable
undertaking. I did some checking on AltaVista and found one service by the
name of "Naughty Lynx" which automatically checks all of its links every hour
or so - one problem with "adult-oriented" sites is that they disappear a lot.
Some such feature would probably be necessary. Seems to be a good potential
use of the DigiCash system, since one doesn't need merchant anonymnity that
much until someone comes up with anonymous-location web pages; the Naughty
Lynx system appears to support itself via advertising). Combining this with a
web proxy would also be good.
