"The Codebreakers" describes (Footnote p516) that in 1939 the Allies
prohibited the use of any codes, but business pressure made them relent and
allow a fixed set of published commercial codes.  On page 842, "The code
compilers strove constantly to find new ways of reducing cable tolls for
users -- this was, after all, their raison d'etre. ..."  It also mentions
(p839) a class of commercial code, mostly numeric, which lent themselves
easily to superencipherment, which seemed to aim quite as much at secrecy
as at economy.  It also mentions that (p850) after WW2 the rising cost of
labor (compared with communication) delt codes a mortal blow.

It seems that both uses were important, with different emphasis for
different users.
