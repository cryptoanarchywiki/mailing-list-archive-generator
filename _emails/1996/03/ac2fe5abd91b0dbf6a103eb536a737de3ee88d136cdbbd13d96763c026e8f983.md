Well, you can add me to the list. Although there are a couple of
problems with the Leahy bill, it still seems to me to be a step 
in the right direction.

I'll answer up front. I work for the University of Minnesota. I don't
get a check, I have direct deposit. If you saw how much it is, you'll
*know* that I don't speak for them. I haven't lied for a couple of
minutes now, and certainly not about my support for the Leahy bill.
I'm not afraid of any right to privacy, in fact I insist on it and
support it whenever possible.

I don't know how you feel, and I wish you wouldn't show me, as I am
afraid that you feel squishy and slightly damp. That might cause me
to lose my appetite.

I can't remember breakfast, now what was that about RICO and World Government?
Did I take over the world again and forget to clean up after myself? Sorry.
