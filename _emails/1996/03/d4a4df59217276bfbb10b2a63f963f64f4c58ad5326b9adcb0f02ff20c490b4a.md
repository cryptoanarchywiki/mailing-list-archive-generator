Three strikes you're fried eh?  Dont even bother cutting off
their hands - straight to old sparky thats what I say!

In theory one would expect the law to deter folk from committing
crimes, but in practice folk (a) don't expect to get caught which
means there aint no deterrent, or (b) the folk don't consider
the crime to be serious, eg. smoking pot.

Yeah, but it don't go off by itself, it needs a big kick.
Did they find any dynamite or other real explosives?  I doubt it.
