Thanks!  It is of interest, but from one or two rounds of previous experience,
I'd not want to draw any conclusions from either RSA's or Cylink's press
releases
about the content or meaning of a given court decision.  They seem to inhabit
different and not-quite parallel universes.

This sounds a lot like Cylink asked for a temporary restraining order
blocking sales of BSAFE until the resolution of a lawsuit, and the judge
rejected that request.  If the quotations mean the same in context
as they do in a press release (:-), they're moderately negative,
though not a total rejection of the main case.  It is pleasant to have
RSA on the side of breaking the D-H patent and limiting the scope of H-M.
Maybe this will help free the algorithms even before Roger Schlafly's suit does.
