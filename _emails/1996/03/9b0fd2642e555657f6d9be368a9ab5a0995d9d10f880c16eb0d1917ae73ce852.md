I don't think this is definitional.  If nothing else they can take the 
equipment.  If you don't incorporate, your personal assets are at risk; 
if you do, you have to keep a real separation between the corporation and 
yourself, pay the taxes, etc.  Ok, make it a non-profit labor of love; 
low risks, no returns, then maybe you are right.  Just hope that there ar 
no punitive or large consequential damages, and no one pierces the 
corporate veil (unlikely, I admit, but not impossible).

What law applies to a certificate used in a multi-jurisdictional
transaction is less obvious to me than I would like.  I think I have
talked a student in my seminar into writing a paper to educate me.
