He's got good ppl advicing him. Basically, these guys even surprised me, 
being in malaysia and all that. but his stand on the matter as well as 
the PM's is pretty good on this. now, the information minister is a 
different kettle of fish altogether, but he'll seccede to the PM's wishes 
anyway.
