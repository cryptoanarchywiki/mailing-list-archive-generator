This is not true. Today it costs hundreds of millions of dollars to bring a new
drug to the U.S. market. I speak from personal experience: my late mother used
to use Rowatinex to relieve kidney symptoms. It's widely available in Europe,
but the Irish manufacturer doesn't want to tell it here because the cost of
getting an FDA approval would be more than what they would make selling it.
Hence, it had to be smuggled in. :-)

Many over-the-counter drugs that became popular before the FDA probably could't
be brought to the market now.
