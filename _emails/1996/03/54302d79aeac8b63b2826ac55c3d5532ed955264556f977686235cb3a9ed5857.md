I am attempting to support the largest number of models possible. Micropayments
is only one model, I have an internet draft out describing a scheme based on
a suggestion by Ron.

I don't think I should choose how people will raise revenue. I don't think
that the NYT will want to be associated with cancer sticks in any case. There
are plenty of sponsors such as IBM, Intel etc who will be happy to pay cash
for a Web  site ad, provided it makes them money.
