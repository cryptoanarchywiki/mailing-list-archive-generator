Practally speaking, this is incorrect.  While most nations complain about 
the application of U.S. law abroad in discovery, unless the foreign 
entity has no U.S. presence what so ever, they are highly vulnerable to 
subpoenas.

Either today or tommorow I'll post a massive article on asset protection 
to the list which discusses many aspects of international subpoena powers 
and jurisprudence in relation to bank documents, and in some cases, 
computer disks and information.

It may answer this question more completely.
