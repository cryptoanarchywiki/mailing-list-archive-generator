They may use secret sharing or splitting methods and handle parts by 
different organizations within themselves and hand other parts to an 
outside agent.  Sometimes this makes sense when there are political

Dilbert's files if he drops dead, but they want an objective party to 
hold part of the key so his rivals don't try to steal his files.
