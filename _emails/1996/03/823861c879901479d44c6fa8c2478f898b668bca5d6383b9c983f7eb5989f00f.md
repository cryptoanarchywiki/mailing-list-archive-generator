  One of the private pilot magazines reported that a small plane operator
  used the code (because his airplane was, in fact, being hijacked).  When he
  landed the airplane, it was surrounded by LEA, and in the ensuing gun
  battle, everyone on the airplane died.  The went on to say that the safety
  of the passengers and airplane are the pilot's primary responsibility and
  that pilots should consider this incident when deciding to use the code.

Actually, that is an urban legend which grew out
of a real incident. What actually happened was
that they thought the private pilot couldn't
really have been hijacked, so when he landed *he*
was arrested for creating a public nuisance or
something. It wasn't till later, when they found
the shotgun-toting druggie, that they believed
him...

Greg Travis was the pilot's name, I imagine
AltaVista might find his original posting.

Greg.
