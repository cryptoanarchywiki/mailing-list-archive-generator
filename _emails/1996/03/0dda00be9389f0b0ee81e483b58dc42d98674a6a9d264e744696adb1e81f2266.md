Well said.  If more people lambasted this "Black Unicorn" fellow for his 
legal-elitist ways, he'd actually be forced to either shut up or use 
reasoned argument to support his odd position.

Laws, as I understand it, used to be written so that ordinary people could 
understand them.  That's the way it ought to be today, but isn't, precisely 
because the elitists have had their way for so long.  There used to be a 
saying, "Ignorance of the law is no excuse."  The presumption was that you 
had a responsibility to know what the law said, and that most people could 
understand what it said, and if you didn't take the time to know it you were 
guilty despite this.  Today, that saying is laughably out of date:  When 
people like "Black Unicorn" claim that ordinary people haven't the skills to 
evaluate any law or proposed law, it is obvious that he and his ilk is a 
major portion of the problem.

The system is sick, perhaps irretrievably so.  Dr. Strangelove (in the movie 
of the same name) stated that "deterrence is the art of making the enemy 
FEAR to attack."  I think the main problem (and the most direct solution) to 
the "politician-problem" in this country is to make government agents FEAR 
to do the wrong thing.

It's going to take a lot more than gunpowder to solve this problem.  
Although that would be a good start...
