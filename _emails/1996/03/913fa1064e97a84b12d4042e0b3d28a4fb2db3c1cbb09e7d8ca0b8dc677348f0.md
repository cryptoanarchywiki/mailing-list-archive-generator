It is probably possible.  Put a clip across the CPU chip, and take over
from it by raising it's chip disable will work with some microprocessors. 
However, the proper application of various kinds of rubber hose to the
operator should make that kind of attack unnecessary.

"Perfect" Forward Security or some approximation helps protect the operator
against such an attack by reducing the amount of compromised material, and
therefore the incentive.
