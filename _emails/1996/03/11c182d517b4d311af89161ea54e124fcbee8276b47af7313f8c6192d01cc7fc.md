The Zip drives have a firmware bug in that they don't do anything if the
(appropriately-named) FUA bit is set in SCSI requests, and then return a
command complete status.  SFS 1.20 has a workaround for this problem.  It
works with both SCSI and parallel-port versions.  Before anyone asks
when it's due out, its the end of February, probably about the 60th of the
month.
