     I don't know about everyone else, but I consider this, if true, to be a 
MAJOR worry.  It never ceases to amaze me how lightly the government takes 
lying to the people.  Unfortunately I don't have the contacts or resources 
to do any further investigation, I hope this thread is resolved one way or 
another soon.
