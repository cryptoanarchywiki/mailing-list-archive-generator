I didn't say that an indexing policy is the determinant of my using it or
not, only that DejaNews looks less attractive than it did before (which
wasn't very attractive anyway, compared to AV...your mileage may vary, so I
won't be engaging in Search Engine Wars).

Well, I mostly disagree with this point. It gives the poster the
_comforting illusion_ of privacy, when in fact the Real Threat (tm) is that
the search engines of 2-5 years from now will trivially uncover all of the
"asides" (to use Rich's term) made in rec.music.white-power and
alt.sex.cypherpunks. It is the searches done several years from now that
will no doubt be of greatest concern to job seekers, professors seeking
tenure, and candidates for political office. No matter the "no archive"
headers, somebody will archive it. Thus, spiders will find it.

This is the "ostrich effect" I was referring to. The illusion of security.

The point is that just because one or more sites is not archiving the
traffic does not mean that other sites are not. Look at the parallels to
cancellation: some sites strongly believe that "cancellation" is a bogus
concept, that once a message has gone out it is part of the overall feed.
(I concur with this view, and, if I ran a site, would not honor so-called
"cancellations.")

Well, what you _want_ and what you're gonna git are not necessarily the
same thing. I expect some sites are going to advertise that they archive
and/or index _all_ public traffic, becoming a "site of record."

At the risk of repeating myself:

-- some people will want to request "no archives" (for "asides" and "off
the record" comments.

-- some sites will honor these requests.

-- other sites will not.

-- that at least one site keeps the traffic and makes indices available is
sufficient to negate the effect of requesting "no archives."

-- the practical effect will be initially to make a search for the "no
archive" words _slightly_  more difficult, but not practically so...in
spiderspace, the distances are compressed and a search will still turn up
the words.

"Totalitarian"? You spoke publically, in this example, and I remembered
your words. What is totalitarian about this? Trying to purge uttered words
is the hard thing to do, actually.

Indeed, the storage densities and net connections that are coming will make
your words here trivially searchable by your daughter in her third-grade
class in 2005. Maybe on her handheld terminal.

(And she'll probably be most interested in the words that Daddy thought to
label as "no archives," as you yourself presaged in an earlier message.
Those are likely to be the juicier things to read.)
