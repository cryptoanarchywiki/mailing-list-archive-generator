SSLeay contains a program asn1parse that will decompose ASN.1 structures.
It also has C routines to play with X509, CRL and certificate requests.
I did not write an ASN.1 compiler, I have written direct C code (using 
macros).  I decided it would be easier that writing a compiler but it 
has probably worked out about the same amount of effort.
