The 101759-?? patch is missing from the Feb 1996 SunSolve Patches CD. However
if one pops in the November 1995 Patches CD there is a nice little copy of
the 101759-03 patch which also comes with the above warning and the DES
enabled libraries.

The Patches CD's are openly sent around the world by Sun Support, one CD
for all the world.

Cheers,
Mark
