1.  Peterson admits he "avoided" references.

2.  The "reason" he gave (that the material was sent to me personally) does 
not justify or even explain his failing to quote my material and respond to 
it.  He could have just as easily sent me email that contained responses to 
all of my comments, had he chosen to do so.

I do not "respect" sleazy people, and especially sleazy people who are 
trying to evade the issues and their failure to be able to address the 
matters under discussion by hiding it in email.  I refuse to assist others 
in hiding their dishonesty by such a tactic.  Since the matter started out 
as a public discussion, I chose to keep it public and still choose this.

Except that your failure to quote that material was clearly intended to 
disguise the fact that you had no satisfactory response (even by your own 
standards!) to my commentary.  This is typical of you.
