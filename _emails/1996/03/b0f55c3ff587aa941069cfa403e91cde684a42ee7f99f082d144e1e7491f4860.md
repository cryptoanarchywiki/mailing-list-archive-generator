It may be MOSTLY good, but I see a big problem.

For reasons which will be obvious to anyone who has read my "Assassination 
Politics" idea, I assert that the operation of the central organization 
could be absolutely legal under current black-letter law.  I may be right 
about this.   The description of the proposed bill, however, clearly 
attempts to criminalize any encryption which may have the effect of 
preventing discovery of people who ARE guilty of felonies, or are planning 
them.

While the bill is not specifically quoted, the broad description given by 
VTW clearly suggests that it is an attempt to cover not merely the felon, 
but also anyone (including entirely innocent people) whose communication 
thwarts the ability of the cops to investigate the felon.  Regularly 
receiving encrypted, anonymous communications encrypted with your public key 
would qualify as a crime, I'll bet, if one of the people who sent them was 
"suspected" of a felony.


For that reason, I can't possibly support this bill; as usual, any such 
provisions will be abused, and obviously I consider any attempt to turn an 
otherwise-legal activity by private individuals into an illegal one is 
questionable at best.

Oh, really?  Why is it that I think this provision was specifically written 
to deal with ME, huh?

What about the users themselves?  Why shouldn't they be told if their info 
was decrypted?

>Requiring key holders to notify the Office of the Courts whenever they

How about insisting on a provision which requires a key-holder to inform the 
source of the encrypted data, as well?

I already have a plan to "dissuade over-zealous law enforcement officials."  
It is called, "Assassination Politics" and I think it will work as well 
against cops as it would against politicians.

By what measure?   A mixture of 1 pound of food and a couple grams of 
cyanide is "on the whole" mostly a healthy product.  Yet if you eat it, it 
will kill you.  It is those exceptions that make this bill unacceptable to me.

Sounds like it's about time to teach myself C++.
