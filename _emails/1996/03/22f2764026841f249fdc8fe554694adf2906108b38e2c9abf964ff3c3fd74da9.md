What copy of the Bill are you reading, Mark?  My copy says that
escrowed keys must be given to the government secretly on demand, NO
WARRANT NEEDED, and the fact that they were given MUST BE KEPT SECRET.

This bill is a small but significant step towards the police state.
If the bill becomes law, no one in their right mind will "voluntarily"
escrow their keys, and then we shall see steadily increasing
compulsion to "voluntarily" escrow keys, like the "voluntary" self
assessment of income tax.

Section 2802(c)(3)(C) is worthless piety.

Every time I come back to this bill it looks more and more repressive.

Section 2802(c)(3)(C) reads:

>  "(C) The inventory required to be served pursuant to section

If you chase 2802(c)(3)(C) to its end, you will find that it means
stuff all, like most of the other supposedly freedom protecting
provisions in this act.

Any crypto bill that we could realistically get out of Washington will
substantially reduce liberty.  The best that we can hope for is for
Washington to forget about crypto until it is too late to stop.
