Interested Cypherpunks might wish to review the following:

The U.S. Russia Business Council
presents its
Fourth Annual U.S.-Russian Trade and Investment
Forecast '96

While at first glance not crypto related, in past this conference has 
brought together a fascinating combination of spooks, private sector 
types, TLA's and academics.  The amount of access to otherwise secretive 
and shadowy officials and "big name" types is significant.  I have found 
in past that everyone at the conference is fairly approachable.  The 
networking and back room, off topic discussions are so numerous that in some 
ways the title of the conference is a misnomer.

Though the fees are hefty, I encourage c'punks who will be in the area to 
consider attending.  Additional information is available at (202) 739-9180.
