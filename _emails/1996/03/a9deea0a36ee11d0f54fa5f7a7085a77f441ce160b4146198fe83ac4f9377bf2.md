Thought that this was worth reposting:

>I attended last weeks "Information, National Policies, and International
>Infrastructure" Symposium at Harvard Law School, organized by the Global
>Information Infrastructure Commission, the Kennedy School and the
>Institute for Information Technology Law & Policy of Harvard Law School.
>
>During the presentation by Paul Strassmann, National Defense University
>and William Marlow, Science Applications International Corporation,
>entitled "Anonymous Remailers as Risk-Free International Infoterrorists"
>the questions was raised from audience (Professor Chaarles Nesson,
>Harvard LAw School) - in a rather extended debate - whether the CIA and
>similar government agencies are involved in running anonymous remailers
>as this would be a perfect target to scan possibly illegal messages.
>
>Both presenters explicitly acknowledged that a number of anonymous
>remnailers in the US are run by government agencies scanning traffic.
>Marlow said that the government runs at least a dozen remailers and that
>the most popular remailers in France and Germany are run by the
>respective government agencies in these countries. In addition they
>mentioned that the NSA has successfully developed systems to break
>encrypted messages below 1000 bit of key length and strongly suggested
>to use at least 1024 bit keys. They said that they semselves use 1024
>bit keys.
>
>I ask Marlos afterwards if these comments were off or on record, he
>paused then said that he can be quoted.
>
>So I thought I pass that on. It seems interesting enough, don't you
>think?
