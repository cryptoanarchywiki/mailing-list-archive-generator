I re-read the bill... it notes "wire" communications, as opposed to 
all forms.  It also allows for previous restrictions to keep in

Still, the distinction between wire and wireless is not clear anymore 
with new technologies.  Certainly if enough HAMs pester Sen. Leahy 
about this 'oversight' positive changes could be made.
