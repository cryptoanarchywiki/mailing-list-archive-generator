Yeah, but that's still a year and a half till they're gone.
Having them gone now (for some relatively small value of "now")
would be especially pleasant, because we can start totally ignoring
them (except for the RSA and Schnorr patents) rather than mostly ignoring them.

Unfortunately, the somebody-at-Siemens-in-Paderborn patent on using
Diffie-Hellman with hashed shared secrets for authentication
is (minimally) good until something like 1994+17, even though it's
so obvious to the skilled practitioner that I thought of it independently
myself.
