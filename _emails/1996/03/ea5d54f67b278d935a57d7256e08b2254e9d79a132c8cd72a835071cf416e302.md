Vaguely apropos the "let's not raise their awareness" thread, a few weeks
back I noticed in the Racing Form a full-page ad for a horse named
"Cryptoclearance." It raced well enough, but its owners getting a lot more
mileage out of studding it--"the 13th leading sire." Its offspring:
Cryptogram, Code of Love, Crypto Lady, Denied Access, Cryptodynamite,
and--I can't tell if my scrawl deceives me--Cryptomay. (If it does, my
apologies.)
        So those who're arguing for keeping a low profile crypto-wise had
better hope that these horses are losers and that its other offspring
(Denied Access, Final Clearance, Pinpoint Control, Mt. Bueran, Clearance
Code) are winners. If there's another Seabiscuit or Secratariat in that
Crypto- lineage (which is pretty doubtful)...
