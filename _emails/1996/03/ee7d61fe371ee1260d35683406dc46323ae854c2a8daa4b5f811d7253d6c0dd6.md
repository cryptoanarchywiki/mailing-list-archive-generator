Pat,


We received today by snail mail from NIST a March 5 "Summary of 
the Proposed 64-bit Software Key Escrow Encryption Export 
Criteria Meeting" on December 5, five-pages,  "prepared by an 
outside observer from Martin Marietta Systems, Inc."


You've probably got a copy as well. If you've not already done 
so, and if you like, we'll be happy to scan it and send over 
for your Web site. Let us know.


John
