What I'm surprised about is that I would be criticized for being suspicious 
(as Declan McCullagh was, below) for doubting the motivations of people who 
propose crypto bills:

I think it's obvious that governments around the world have a very poor 
record of responding "well" to encryption with any kind of acceptable 
legislation.  Arguably, laws should exist for the benefit of the public, but 
what's happening is that governments are using their authority to try to 
restrain the political consequences of technical developments.  I see no 
benefit to the public in laws against encryption, and certainly no net benefit.

We should be particularly suspicious of any hint of a pan-European ban or 
control of encryption, because that is exactly the kind of development that 
could usher in a secretly-negotiated treaty that might be argued to be 
binding on the public.
