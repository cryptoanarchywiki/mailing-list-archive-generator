    I would like to thank the gentleman, who identified himself only
as a cypherpunk, who fetched my keys out of the door of my wife's car
(I frequently leave keys sticking in the doors of cars), knocked on
the window, and handed them to me.

   To those who have seen the Equinox TV piece on cryptography, I
will remark that it was the same set of keys and the same car
that appeared on that show.
					Whit
