I don't think they'd be stupid enough to do that.  Even a fool knows that 
what I really want is publicity, and that is exactly what the government 
would be best advised NOT to give me.  If they decided to press the issue, 
it would turn into one of the purest 1st amendment cases that has ever 
existed. Worse for them, it would automatically publicize my AP idea to an 
audience of millions, which I believe would cook their goose but good.  They 
know this, and they know that harassing me will not stop the fundamental idea.
