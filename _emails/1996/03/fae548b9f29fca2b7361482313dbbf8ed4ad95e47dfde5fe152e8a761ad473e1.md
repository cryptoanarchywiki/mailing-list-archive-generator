Anyone who can read, should not have any problem figuring out that
I never made anything resembling the "point" ascribed to me.
There is certainly no point in carrying on a discussion with

I could care less what language the people around me speak, but
it would be a more civilized world if they took care to tone
up their reasoning.  And when they need to resort to lies like
this to shore up their arguments, tar & feather 'em.
