Ain't nothing fine about that print. An operating system or piece of
hardware may be C2 certifiable. But only a complete system in a specific
configuration can be certified as C2 compliant. The way I read the orange
book, no system with a network connection can ever be C2. For that matter a
system can't get C2 unless it is in an area where you can control and
monitor physical access to the system.

So if you can't hack it over the wire, and you can't remove, rewrite and
replace the kernel because you can't get near the keyboard what's the problem?
