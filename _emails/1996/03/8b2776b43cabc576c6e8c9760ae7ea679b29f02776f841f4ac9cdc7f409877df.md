Indeed this would be a technologically superior system. The system I'm
thinking of, however, has a capital startup cost of under $250.

I am not entirely sure how the whole domian name etc. issue will be handled
as numbered accounts fill up. I am also discussing with friends the idea of
the no-domain-name style, similar to penet.fi with various forms of REQUEST
REMAILING TO.... 
 
In other words, this or that person acts as a (perhaps temporary) remailer
from their regular account, gets the material encrypted, and massages it in
various ways before sending it out. The point is to increase entropy by
creating the technological base for an enormous proliferation of
remailer/anon tech at the lowest possible price. 
 
Internationally know "elite" (in the good sense of the word) remailers are
by definition known, and thus easy to monitor. Mixmaster etc sites popping
up from the home computers in the rec rooms of suburbia are not.
