The physical and network location of the machine doing mail service for 
gateway.com will be moving some time around March 31/April 1.  Hopefully, 
service will not be interrupted for more than about 3-4 hours, but I 
can't promise anything (the system will be moving to my side of an ISDN 
circuit instead of living on-site with one of my clients).

This move will affect the following mailing lists:

			bsdi-users
			bsdi-users-d
			cypherpunks-d
			unix-lizards

There may also be an impact on other lists as routing for the gateway.com 
domain is moved from its current 192.x.x.x network to a CIDR block under 
another provider.  The other lists involved will be:

			bsdi-isps
			cheapnet
			humor
			xconq
			
Sorry about this, but over-all, service will be better after the move (I 
will once again, be the master of my network's destiny [or something like 
that])
