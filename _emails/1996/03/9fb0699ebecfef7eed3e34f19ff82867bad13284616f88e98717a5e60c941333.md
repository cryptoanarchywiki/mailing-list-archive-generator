	I somewhat doubt the below is correct in their believing their actions
are the reasons for the anti-Internet-phone move. The recent announcement by
2 New Jersey companies of a service whereby someone with a computer linkup
can call someone without it (on Reuters on Yahoo) would appear to be a
better explanation.

Subject: [Free World Dialup]: 'VON/FWD/IPHONE' ACTIVITIES CONSIDERED "MISUSE
OF THE INTERNET" - BY ACTA (130 USA Long Distance Telephone Carriers)

      *******************************************************
      VON ALERT -- FWD ALERT --IPHONE ALERT -- NETWATCH ALERT
      *******************************************************

It appears that our recent FREE WORLD DIALUP press release was the straw
that broke the camel's back.

The FCC was petitioned yesterday by ACTA "TO STOP MISUSE OF THE INTERNET".

The sale and use of Voice-On-the-Net (VON) software is being challenged by
130 of the USA's largest long distance telephone carriers.  Among them, MCI,
SPRINT, and LDDS.

According to the ACTA press release:

"A growing number of companies are selling software programs with ancillary
hardware options that enable a computer to transmit voice conversations.
This, in fact, creates the ability to "by-pass" local, long distance and
international carriers and allows for calls to be made for virtually 'no cost.'"

And also, "...the misuse of the Internet as a way to "by-pass" the
traditional means of obtaining long distance service could result in a
significant reduction of the Internet's ability to transport its ever
enlarging amount of data traffic."

'VON' COALITION BEING FORMED

A VON Coalition is currently being formed and members will testify at the
spring meeting of the FCC when they discus telephony issues.

If you don't want to loose your right to VON technology, NOW is the time to
be counted.

WHAT CAN I DO?

We need an immediate head count of those on these lists that CARE ENOUGH TO
BECOME INVOLVED!

well be lost!
