I'm pretty sure it was you. As I don't want to search through past posts to
try to find your use of this, let me make it clear that the language I was
referring to was what I quoted: "unsurprising."

I think you pointed out that instead of talking about "right" and "wrong,"
charged as they are, one can instead talk about certain events being
"unsurprising."

If this was not your coinage, and no one else steps forward, then I'll
gladly steal it and file the serial number off.
