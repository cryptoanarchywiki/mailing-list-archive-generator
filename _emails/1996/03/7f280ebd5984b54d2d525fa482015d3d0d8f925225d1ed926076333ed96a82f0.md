Only if I can have a good enough idea of the non-random method for
generating numbers, or if I can find some useful statistical correlations
in your numbers.  (And then again, what do you mean by "significantly
easier"?  Knowing 1 bit reduces the work by half, but with orders or
thousands of bits, it's not much help.)

Whether I can realisitically reproduce or work with that non-random
method of key generation is another matter, though.
