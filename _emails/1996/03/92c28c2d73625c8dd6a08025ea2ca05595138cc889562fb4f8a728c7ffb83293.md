   3-4-96. WSJ: 
 
   "U.S. Commission Recommends Staff Cuts at Intelligence 
   Agencies." 
 
      The most numerous cuts would be at the CIA, DIA and NSA. 
      Former Sen. Warren Rudman said the super-secret NSA, 
      which conducts various forms of electronic eavesdropping 
      abroad, was most in need of a cut that could provide 
      money for new computer-related technology and bring in 
      people with new technical skills. 
 
   3-3-96. NYT: 
 
   "Spy Pablum." [Editorial] 
 
      After a year of study and high public expectations, the 
      commission stepped up to this promising moment with all 
      the spine of a rag doll. There is nothing radical about 
      its report, which is precisely its problem. When it 
      comes to the larger picture of just what kind of 
      intelligence network America needs now that the cold war 
      is over, and whether some agencies ought to be combined 
      or eliminated altogether, the commission lacks 
      imagination and courage.
