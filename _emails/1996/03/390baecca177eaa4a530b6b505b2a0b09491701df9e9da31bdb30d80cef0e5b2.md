I think that 1-800 services provide caller ID information to the company or 
organization that pays for the service.  Whether or not this is blocked by 
standard caller-ID I don't know.   Nevertheless, like you, I am not 
impressed with the likelihood of success of this system.

One thing that might be useful would be a OTP (one-time programmable) EPROM 
chip installed on all major system components (monitor, HD, motherboard, 
CDROM drive, maybe even DRAM SIMMs).  It would be a serial device for low 
cost, such as a 3-pin TO-92 chip, which would have a capacity of about 4k 
bits, enough to store a hash of the owner-history (at about 100 bits per 
owner) for any owner that decided to leave a record. Like an EPROM, bits 
could only be written once; the chip itself would prevent write-overs 
previous to the last-written bit. 

Subsequent owners could read the history and publish the hash codes; anyone 
looking for such a stolen product could have their losses checked 
automatically, and perhaps semi-anonymously or anonymously, by a service set 
up to do this.  Innocent owners could be adequately compensated for finding 
a piece of stolen hardware, to the extent that nobody is deterred about 
reporting a find.
