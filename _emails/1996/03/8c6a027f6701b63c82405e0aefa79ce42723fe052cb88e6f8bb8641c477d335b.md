	Actually, this is not all all irrelevant.  The question of how
a non-American living in the US can benefit from writign crypto code
has been a topic of discussion the last few days.  A real
understanding of laundering is needed for the time between now and
when the bad guys stop trying to tax the non-physical.

	I look forward to having a chance to read it.
