This is indeed good news.  I haven't followed the satellite wars
for a while, and although I was aware that the earlier European
system had been broken, I didn't know that the one used by the
DSS folks had by now also met a similar fate.

This is interesting, since the technology to do unbreakable
encryption and authorization certainly exists.  Perhaps the DSS
folks should have brought in a few Cypherpunks as quality control
consultants. :)

Again, it's been a while since I looked at the industry, but I
was under the impression that the VideoCipher II was still used
by Satellite dish owners to receive CNN, HBO, SHO, TMC, and the
rest of the ordinary analog pay cable channels.

Has everyone now been forced to upgrade to something "new and
improved?"

Digital systems eliminate the main drawback of analog ones for
using cryptography, namely that there is no way to strongly
encrypt the video and ship it out using the same modulation
technique which originally encoded it.

Once you have both audio and video streams in digital form,
having ones encryption "hacked" is more a function of
cluelessness on the part of those engineering the encryption and
authentication mechanism than some latent vulnerability on the
part of the technology.

I'm really surprised that DSS got hacked, given that the hacking
of the European digital system was well known while DSS was being
constructed.  Sounds like a very slow learning curve somewhere in
the engineering process.

In a well engineered smart card system for authorizing individual
viewers of a digital audio/video stream, each card contains a
unique serial number and a random cryptographic key stored during
the manufacturing process in a manner which cannot be obtained
even by destructive reverse engineering of a particular card.

The originating system then uses this information to embed
messages in the transmitted data stream permitting individual
cards to decrypt and recover the random and frequently changing
session key with which the channel bitstream has been strongly
encrypted.

If such a system has been properly implemented, all the
specifications for it should be able to be published without
compromising it.  Emulators for the software used in the cards
shouldn't be a problem as long as serial#/key pairs for specific
cards are not disclosed.

Perhaps in the private sector, where snake oil abounds.  I
suspect military types do things a bit more cleverly than the
prior scenario implies.

BTW - what is the legal status of hacking DSS?  It's not like
cable, where you are tapping into a municipal service illegally.
You own the dish, the decoder, and the photons with which the
satellite is irradiating your back yard.  Can the government
really regulate how you choose to process photons found on your
own private property with equipment you own?

Have there been any test cases?
