I don't know that it would be that expensive.  If someone was able to gain
root access to the system, something like "strings /dev/kmem" could narrow
the search for the passphrase down significantly.  Of course one could
obfuscate the passphrase by XOR'ing it with 0x80, but that's only security
through obscrurity.
