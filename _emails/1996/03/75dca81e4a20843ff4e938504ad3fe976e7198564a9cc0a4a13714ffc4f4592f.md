Somebody posted this editorial this morning, that includes the
following passage:

Now, I thought that the bills did no such thing.  How could The
Washington Post get this so wrong?

As I understand it, the bills do not in any way tie export to
key escrow.  They mention key escrow only to the extent that
they specify that it is illegal to disclose the keys.

Why would the paper get this cockeyed?  Is it just a screwup,
or are they pushing for a change?
