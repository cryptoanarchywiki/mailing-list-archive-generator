Hmmm - that's another issue; what about diffie hellman with ephemeral 
keys? Once the transaction is complete, unless you keep a copy of the key, 
even you can't decrypt that session. Would a law requiring you to keep a 
copy of the keys be important. It would have the advantage of allowing 
a sub-poena to be more restrictive than "just hand over your private 
key", but it's a pretty heavy (undue?) burden.
