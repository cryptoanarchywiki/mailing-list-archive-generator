Well, do you want to "unsubsrcribe" or "unsubsribe"?

Not that it matters which of these you choose, but perhaps you ought to use
a correct spelling ("unsubscribe").

Note to others: Other lists I am on have had the same frantic demands that
people be "unsurscribed," "unscribed," and "unnsubscrubbed." I chalk it up
to a nation filled with illiterates.

(Remind me not to open an account at this "Bank of Nova Scotia.")
