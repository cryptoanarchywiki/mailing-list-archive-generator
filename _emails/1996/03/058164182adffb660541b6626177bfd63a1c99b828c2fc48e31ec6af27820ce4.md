Those interested in an Information Security-related position
might be interested in checking out:

        Cameron Carey
        Computer Security Placement Service
        (508) 393-7803

He specializes in placing InfoSec persons (only).  His contacts 
are numerous and last time I checked, he knew of about a dozen
or so openings.

I have used him in the past.  He's one of very few headhunters
I have met who will actually work your resume & call you frequently
with the status (where your resume is, the type of company, etc.).

FWIW, it doesn't matter if you mention my name or not - I have no 
vested interest in recommending him other than I believe that people 
who do a good job ought to be recommended to others.

Best Regards,


Frank
