Jim seems to analyse a situation in terms of broad principles, 
while Dave seems to focus more on specifics that would disprove Jim.

I agree with the Dave's last phrase in the sense that our models of reality
should indeed be rooted in reality.

But considering that in most european country, you are recognized guilty 
unless proven innocent, it is only non-contradictory to arrive at Jim's
conclusions.  The basic psycho-epistemology at work there is implying that.

Maybe that on the instant, ugly things are not happening, but nevertheless, 
the basic principles held about man, his nature and therefore, about how he 
should be treated leads, by their own logic, to ugly things.
