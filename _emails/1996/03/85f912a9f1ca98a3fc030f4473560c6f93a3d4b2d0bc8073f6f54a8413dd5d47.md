exmh on Unix systems goes the other way. It adds a header line that
includes the sender and recipient, plus the action to be performed
("encrypt," "sign" or "encryptsign"). No header, no encryption/signature.
I'm reasonably sure it strips off that line before it passes the message
off to sendmail -- but I usually don't send messages to myself that way. :-
)

For incoming mail, it looks for standard PGP structure and figures out what
it needs from the user. If, for instance, you don't have a public key on
your keyring, it allows you to send a mail message to a server to grab it -
- - otherwise it performs the operation and shows you the results.

If what you're doing requires a password (signing or decrypting), it pops
up a window to ask you for it. When it's done, it prompts you to press
Return and disappears.

It was written in tcl/Tk, but some of it may be applicable for what you
want to do. (Sorry, I'm not an expert on either.)
