	One difficulty in this is that the middle managers - the most vital
ones in the long run - are also the ones that can best protect themselves using
the net and various cypherpunks techniques - partial (not to their superiors)
anonymnity with persistent, verifiable pseudonyms. If they don't directly
deal with the public, they're kind of hard to target.

	You have an interesting point about motivations and the likely
psychological effects. Given the headaches that counterintelligence goes
through in wars - nobody wants to shut up - such secrecy would be difficult.

	Would they? You appear to be assuming that with less targets available,
people will start being less selective. You may be correct.

	Has it? Currently, we've got the guys who deal with the public (the
politicians and the low-level bureaucrats) and the faceless drones (the rest
of the bureaucrats). The politicians can be protected, and already are to some
degree. The low-level bureaucrats aren't _that_ likely to be targeted by enough
people to make a difference, and the ones who go bad enough to do so can be
protected (or sacrificed, if that seems to be the way to keep the public
happy). The faceless drones can be even more faceless, and so very hard to
target.

	That's an interesting point. I can see some sort of Blacknet-variety
system developing to distribute information and get paid for it, even if the
employee in question doesn't want to do the hit themselves, although the
payment part could be a problem. Even with the partial anonymnity protections
I mention above, _somebody_ will know who the person who ordered another Ruby
Ridge is - I doubt a government could operate with full internal anonymnity.
