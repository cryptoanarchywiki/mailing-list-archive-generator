CYBERSPACE LAW FOR NONLAWYERS
-----------------------------

Three highly respected law school professors (Professor Larry Lessig,
University of Chicago Law School; Professor David Post, Georgetown
University Law Center; and Professor Eugene Volokh, UCLA School of Law)
have written a *FREE*, online cyberlaw workshop called, appropriately,
"CYBERSPACE LAW FOR NONLAWYERS."  CYBERSPACE LAW is specifically written
for lay people like you and me, and the workshop's lessons use
easy-to-understand English -- NOT legalese and Latin!


YEAH, BUT WILL I *UNDERSTAND* IT?
---------------------------------

Actually, yes. The workshop's authors really are writing CYBERSPACE LAW's
lessons for educated lay people, *NOT* lawyers.

I took a look at an earlier article written by one of the workshop's
professors (Eugene Volokh, "Cheap Speech and What It Will Do", 104 Yale
L.J.1805 (1995)), and I have to say that I am quite impressed ... although
I have to say that I am quite disappointed that Volokh did not have a
single Southern word *anywhere* in his article :)


WHAT WILL THE WORKSHOP COVER?
-----------------------------

CYBERSPACE LAW is going to help you learn the basic principles of -- and
unlearn some common myths about --

     - copyright law,
     - free speech law,
     - libel law,
     - privacy law,
     - contract law, and
     - trademark law

as they apply on the Net.  Each CYBERSPACE LAW "lesson" should be about the
size of an average TOURBUS post (about a page or two), and will e-mailed to
you through an e-mail distribution list.  The CYBERSPACE LAW workshop will
last a couple of weeks, and you'll get two or three letters a week from the
authors ... and, best of all, the entire workshop is FREE!


THE INSTRUCTORS
---------------

Professor Larry Lessig clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin
Scalia, and now teaches constitutional law and the law of cyberspace at the
University of Chicago Law School.  He's written about law and cyberspace
for the Yale Law Journal and the University of Chicago Legal Forum
(forthcoming).

Professor David Post practiced computer law for six years, then clerked for
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He now teaches
constitutional law, copyright law, and the law of cyberspace at the
Georgetown University Law Center.  He's written about law and cyberspace
for the University of Chicago Legal Forum (forthcoming) and the Journal of
Online Law, and writes a monthly column on law and technology issues for
the American Lawyer.

Professor Eugene Volokh worked as a computer programmer for 12 years, and
is still partner in a software company that sells the software he wrote for
the Hewlett-Packard Series 3000.  He clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, and now teaches constitutional law and copyright law
at the UCLA School of Law.  He's written about law and cyberspace for the
Yale Law Journal, Stanford Law Review, Michigan Law Review (forthcoming),
and the University of Chicago Legal Forum (forthcoming).
