I would like to get information about how the QuickBooks accounting program
by Intuit stores its data files.  I also would like to know what it does
with the passwords and how it encrypts the files. (If it even encrypts them)
If you have any of this information or know where I can find it I would
really appreciate it.  Thanks in advance to any replies.
