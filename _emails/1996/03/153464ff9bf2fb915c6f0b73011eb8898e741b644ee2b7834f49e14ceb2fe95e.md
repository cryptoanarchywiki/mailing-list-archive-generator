C'punks,

As promised, below is the list of folks who have asked to be put

one volunteer who supports Mr/Ms Anonymous...sort of.

	is disappointed that he didn't make the "LIST OF SHAME", 
	but understands that perhaps he hasn't done enough to 
	oppose controls on cryptography. I'll work harder, and 
	hopefully you will denounce me soon."

SUPPORTERS OF MR/MS ANONYMOUS

Subject: A vote for ANON's position [with reservations]

Supporters of the Leahy Bill are, to me, well-intentioned dupes.

I've lurked on this list under this and a previous usename since the 
list was a couple months old. I came here to learn crypto, not debate 
politics. And, while the urge has often been all but overwhelming, 
I've for most part kept my silence, prefering back channels to 
posting on the list.

The Politics of the Absurd has in the last year or three found me in 
agreement with figures on the national scene whose pockets I would
decline to piss were their balls on fire. Nor am I quite comfy siding
with anonymous in regard to the Leahy Bill, but...

I neither like nor trust the bill and, after the Digital Telephony 
Bill and its manner of passage, my trust in the good senator is zero.

I am still a little puzzled why there was so little discussion on the 
list of what Freeh might have told the congresscritters that long 
summer when he seems to have visited them all. Sort of makes this 
leftie wonder if, just maybe, the rightwing conspiracy boys who claim 
the unusual number of congressional dropouts was the result of FINCIN 
findings might not have stumbled upon a quarter-grain of truth.

While I applaud the efforts of those working for the cause in the 
political sphere, I have scant faith. Business will be on the side of 
privacy until it gets what it wants, then walk away from individual 
concerns for privacy, etc.

I've always enjoyed your posts and sense of humor. Apologies for 
going on at length.
