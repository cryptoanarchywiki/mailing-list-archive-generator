   3-20-96. TWP (privatizing the global NatSec frankenstein):

   "South Africa Weighs Reining In Peddlers of Mercenary
   Ex-Soldiers."

      In this once highly militarized society, the transition
      from white-minority rule produced unemployed commandos
      and spies suddenly without a cause. So, controversial
      military and intelligence units are selling their skills
      to the rest of Africa and beyond. Executive Outcomes,
      the best known and apparently largest of firms offering
      overt and covert security services, says the company's
      services are in great demand. It operates within a murky
      network of other international companies that specialize
      in oil drilling, diamond mining and landmine removal.
      The firm also has been reported to hire former commandos
      of Britain's SAS and the Selous Scouts of the old
      white-ruled Rhodesia, as well as military technicians
      from the former Soviet Union.
