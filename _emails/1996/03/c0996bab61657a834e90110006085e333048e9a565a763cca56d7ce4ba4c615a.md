What difference does that make?  If you are deranged enough to murder someone
because they are selling crack in your territory, you are deranged enough to
shoot your manager after getting fired from McDonalds, or to do any number of
heinous things that ahve nothing to do with drug laws.  Sick people will
still do sick things, even if some of them are legalized.
