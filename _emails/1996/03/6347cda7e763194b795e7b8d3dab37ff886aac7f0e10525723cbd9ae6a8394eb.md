Hold it:  Backup:  Opponents of the bill say it says X:  Supporters of the 
bill say it says Y:  The proposal is to rewrite the bill so it actually 
does say Y in plain english.  And you (quite correctly) say that the bill
will not pass if says Y.

You are right.

The bill does not facilitate crypto exports, it just sounds like it does, 
and it delegates judicial powers to cops.

If it was amended to facilitate crypto exports, and to maintain the 
separation of judiciary and executive, it would not pass.
