Some folks (this was awhile back) were looking for texts on cryptanalysis 
and related cryptographic topics.  Today, I ran across some stuff published 
by an outfit called "Aegean Park Press."  With such titles as "Manual for 
the Solution of Military Ciphers," "Elementary Military Cryptography," and 
"Cryptanalysis of Shift-Register Generated Stream Cipher Systems," they 
sound like a source of potentially interesting material.

A lot of what they are publishing are now-declassified military 
manuscripts, and they specialize in military-related historical stuff and 
crypto-related mathematics, etc.

A Web resource for them is at http://www.halcyon.com/books/

Otherwise, contact them at:
