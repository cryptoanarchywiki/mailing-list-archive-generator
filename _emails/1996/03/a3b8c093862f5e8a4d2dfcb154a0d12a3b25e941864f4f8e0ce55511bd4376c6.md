	Tim,

	I'm forced to disagree on this point.  I think that the
comparable product has the potential to be a very big deal; it means
that any product using IDEA or 3DES may become exportable, because
such products are available outside the US.

	It may be that wide use will be quibbled over, but DES, weak
as it is, is widely used outside the US, and IDEA and 3DES will be.
Thats why this legistlation will fail to pass.
