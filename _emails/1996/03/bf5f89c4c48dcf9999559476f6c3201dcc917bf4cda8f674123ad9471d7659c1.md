American Express Platinum card holders might want to look at the bottom 
of their statement:

CARD USE ON THE INTERNET -- Cardmembers should only conduct transactions 
over the internet using broswer software that supports industry-standard 
encryption protocols, such as those offered by Netscape or CyberCash.  We 
anticipate that additional and improved encryption protocols for Card 
transactions will become available over the next 3-6 months.  American 
Express will keep you informed of new developments in this area.

(Any Gold or Green card holders have the same notice?)
