This is a bad idea, because in addition to the extra processor overhead, it
is an incredible waste of bandwidth.  For a 512 byte packet, you are only
getting .02% efficiency, because you wouldn't be able to use the actual data
in the packet; otherwise someone would probably notice the increased error
rate if you dink around with the checksum.  This does not provide adequate
plausible deniability.  Stegoing a 16 bit WAV file gives you 50% efficiency,
(you can replace the 8 least significant bits with stego data and still keep
10 bits worth of sound quality) and someone else would be unable to prove
there was any encrypted info in it if you did it right.
