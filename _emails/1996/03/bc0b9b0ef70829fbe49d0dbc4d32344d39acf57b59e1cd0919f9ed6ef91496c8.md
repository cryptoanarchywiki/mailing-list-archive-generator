Why not tell me why you didn't cite rules of statuatory construction, or 
the merit of looking at legislative history?  I'm hardly going to 
spend 4 hours of legal research to rebuke what is a patently flawed 
"legal" opinion.  Long time members of the list will know already that I 
am quite generous with my legal research when a legitimate legal problem 
arises.  My patience does not extend to upstarts who's knowledge of law 
is limited to complaining about how legal scholars and Supreme Court 
Justices have their head up their asses.

You dismiss 7 learned people quite quickly.  I know it's tempting to be 
superior to them, but as far as I can tell, you haven't even taken a 
judicial process class in undergrad.

This illustrates my problem with you, and your writings to the list.  This 
isn't the opinion of a noted legal scholar.  It's not the opinion of a 
renound attorney, or court observer.  It's not even the opinion of a law 
student.  The bottom line is that you just don't know what you're talking 
about.  You are wasting the list's time, my time, and, incidently, your time.

Excepting 5 surpreme court justices, the prosecution, and hundreds of 
years of American Jurisprudence.  Sure, you're a more legitimate judge of 
decisions.  Really it's just that you don't like the decision, and have 
latched on to anything to justify your dislike with the illusion of 
intelligence and knowledge, including a newspaper article in a local paper.

What the hell does this have to do with your long stretch in applying it 
to the Leahy bill?

Wrong.  The assumption is that the rules of statuatory construction and a 
long history of weighing legislative history will be used in intrepreting 
the statute.

I could go on for paragraphs about how this basic error on your part 
demonstrates your misunderstanding of the divisons of labor between 
the Legislative and Judiciary, and that your really calling for an active 
Judiciary that disregards law and imposes its own view in the face of 
obvious legislative intent, and go on longer about the importance of 
using cannons of construction to insure consistancy, but none of that 
would change the basic fact that you just don't know what you are talking 
about, and that arguing with you is like talking to a soap box preacher.  
You don't really care for logic.

No, I just feel it's probably beyond someone who couldn't name 2 cannons 
of statuatory intrepretation to rant on for paragraphs about the impact 
of a supreme court decision on a pending statute.

I'm not defending the decision at all.  Simply pointing out that it's 
connection to the Leahy bill is non-existant, and that you are a non-entity
when it comes to legal analysis.

I'm not interested in the opinion, or Will's explanation of what it 
meant.  I am interested in bringing some sanity to the list by filtering 
out the fluff and bullshit that results when people who know nothing 
about legislation or lawmaking proport to be experts.

I'm sure you, however, would be quite willing to allow a pre-med student 
preform your bypass operation.

Considering you have never read the opinion, or the briefs of the 
respective parties, and are relying on only the (perhaps legal, perhaps 
not) opinion of a newspaper writer, I think you're on fairly thin ice 
even without my help.

You assume I support the Leahy Bill.  Quote me.  Where do you find my 
support?  Because I think you should be taken with the grain of salt your 
legal ignorance obviously deserves?  I could care less which side you are 
on, but I'm hardly going to let your ignorance be taken for anything but 
what it is.

Why not demonstrate you're right first Mr. Bell?  Tell us all how the 
latest decision will impact Leahy bill in terms a bit more specific than 
"The supreme court is stupid, so you're going to get screwed."  Cite 
provisions.  Show us why the dicta you use is important rather than 
fluff.  What was the holding in the seizure case?  Do you even know?

It's easy for me to say "The latest Supreme Court Decision is going to 
make currency ILLEGAL!  LOOK OUT!  HIDE YOUR DOUGH!"  However, this does 
not mean I can expect every legal expert on the list to spend hours going 
over the opinion, and refuting endlessly the raving antics of my lunacy.  
The burden is on the presentor to make the connection.  You're logic 
seems to look mostly like this.

There was a court decision.
Mr. Will is a popular newspaper writer.
therefore Mr. Will is qualified to intrepret the decision.
Mr. Will says some disparaging things about the decision.
threfore The Decision is BAD.
The decision has to do with seizure of jointly owned property.
Remailer messages are jointly owned property.
therefore the decision must apply to remailers.
Since the property in the decision was seized,
and since the Leahy bill has something to say about encryption,
and since the seizure decision means that the supreme court has their 
head up their ass,
therefore remailer messages and remailers WILL BE SEIZED.

If there is a more logical chain here, I'd love to hear it.

> you can.  Convince us that you're not just an elitist snob

I am an elitist snob.  Who want's a passive attorney fighting for them?  
I worked hard for my degrees, my post-graduate work, and the Bar.  I think I 
have earned a bit of ego for my years of hell.  If nothing else, I have 
taken 23 hours more of aba accredited legislation courses from a top 10 
U.S. law school than you have.
