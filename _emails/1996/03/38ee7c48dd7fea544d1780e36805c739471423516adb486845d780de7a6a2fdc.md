   While we're on the subject, I called Sam Capino's office regarding my
CJR for this t-shirt, and he said they were still waiting for a response
from the NSA. I think my next move will be a letter asking exactly when
I can expect a response, and whether there's anything I can do to compel
a response, It was originally filed (in October) as a 15-day expedited
review.

   Thus, the actual legal status of the shirt is murky. Don't be
surprised if they approve it after they quit stalling.
