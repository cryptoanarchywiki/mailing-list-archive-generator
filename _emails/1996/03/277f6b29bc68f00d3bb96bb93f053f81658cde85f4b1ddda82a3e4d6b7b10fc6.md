There is also the problem of knowing WHICH key to use (ie: Even when you
know the message is intended for you, you must do a test run with each of
your keys until one works). Thus you want private keys whose ownership is
not publicly linked to your known identity (but is known to your
correspondents). So long as you have your corespondent's published Public
Key, you can use it to do a one-time transmission of a private Public Key
to be used to do anonymous (ie: Not Linked to your Public Identity)
transmissions to you.
