I would like to state here that the policy of Mark Twain Bank on
what merchants can or can not sell with ecash is NOT the official
policy of DigiCash. We can not and do not force our banking
licensees any restrictions on the kind of material they sell. On the
other hand, we can also not forbid them to put restrictions on that.

There are laws that require MT to comply with local (St. Louis MO
USA) regulations even when things being sold are acceptible in both
the merchant's and the buyer's country. I don't know for sure if
this is relevant in this specific case, and I would also like to
hear a comment from Mark Twain at this moment. We do not know their
exact policy.
