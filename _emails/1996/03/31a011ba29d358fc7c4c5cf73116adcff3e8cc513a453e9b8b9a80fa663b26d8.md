I notice that Netcom takes *EVERYTHING*.  (Including the incredibly bogus
and silly groups.)  Teleport has never, to my knowledge, taken that group.  

Teleport has since removed all of the remaining warez groups in an effort of
moral excess.  (After taking all of the groups in existance, including the
forign ones that nobody on Teleport reads, and claiming they did not censor
groups.)  Personally I could care less about the warez groups (it is not as
if you could ever find a complete program), but the crypto one would have
been nice to see...
