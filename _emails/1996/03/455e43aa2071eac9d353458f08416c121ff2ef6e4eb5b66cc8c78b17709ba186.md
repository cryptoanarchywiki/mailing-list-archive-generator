The big problem with the list isn't just signal-to-noise,
it's VOLUME VOLUME VOLUME - you don't want somebody to subscribe
and get flodded with 100 messages/day without warning.
(There's also the problem with newbies sending us mail
saying "please send me some anarkist crypt0 warez, d00ds!"

If you're going to refer to the list, please mention
        - the cypherpunks home page is www.csua.berkeley.edu/cypherpunks
        - you can browse the list with a news reader at nntp.hks.net
                and with the web at www.hks.net (delayed a bit).
        - the list is high volume, 50-100 messages/day,
        - there are lots of readers, 500-1000, who get all the mail sent to
the list.
        - if you want to unsubscribe, send mail to majordomo@toad.com, saying
                help
        - oh, BTW, if you _do_ want to subscribe, cypherpunks-request@toad.com
                is the canonical location, and majordomo@toad.com is the droid.
