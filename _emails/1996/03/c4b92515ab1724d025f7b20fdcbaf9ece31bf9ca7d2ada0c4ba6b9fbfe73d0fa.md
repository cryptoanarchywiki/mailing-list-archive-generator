The coercion occurs at the govt/businessman interface and it does
 not concern the artist/businessman interface.  If the artist 
refused to com promise, the businessman activities would be so 
lame that nobody would get interested in it.  And it is about 
time that the business world regain power.  I do not mean the big
govt-sucking business but the millions of small business that get
fleeced by the govt/big business affiliation.

I think that you are taking things out of context a bit.  A govt
is a tool that *we* create in order to help run certains things.
Among others, are the defence dept, the courts applying as 
objective as possibles laws and the issuing of money.  But today's 
govt is a living blood thirsty entity that went loose on it's 
own...
