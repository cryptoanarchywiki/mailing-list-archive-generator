I just received this as the moderator for comp.os.ms-windows.announce. 

Would that be "Donut" as in "big hole"?

Subject: ANNOUNCE: Donut: Web Basic Interpreter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richland, WA.  March 20, 1996.  Battelle Memorial Institute today released
Donut (1.00 Alpha 1), a Visual Basic form Interpreter for the Web.

Donut is a program that allows a Visual Basic form file to be transmitted 
over the internet and viewed on a user's computer as a form.  This form will 
then interact with the user and their web browser to send or request 
information just like a normal Visual Basic program.  Donut does not require
any Visual Basic files or DLLs in order to work.

This will allow creation of web forms that give the author more control over 
exactly what the form will look like, allows interaction between the Donut 
applet and the user's browser, and allows processing of form information on 
the user's computer instead of on the server.  And it allows you to use 
existing expertise with the very popular and common Visual Basic programming 
language to do so.

Currently Donut is available for the Microsoft Windows operating system 
(Windows 3.x, Windows 95 or NT).  It works with any Windows web browser that
supports the standard interprocess (DDE) communication for web browsers.  
It has been tested and works with Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet 
Explorer, and several variations of Mosaic.

Donut should be able to run most simple Visual Basic programs with few if
any modifications.  (Unlike VBScript where you must now cut and paste 
the source code into a HTML page.)

Donut is available without charge to end users.
