While I don't agree with some of the conclusions you reached in your note,
I certainly agree that the Leahy bill would be better for cryptography
without this crime.  I hope that section gets further narrowed (or removed
altogether), but based on discussions I've had with various Senate staffers,
I'm not optimistic that it will be.

If you feel strongly about this, I urge you to lobby your Senators
(and representatives, since there's also a House version of the bill) and
tell them exactly what you like and don't like about this legislation, as
I am doing with mine.
