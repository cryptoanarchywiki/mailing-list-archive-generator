	Thanks. Incidentally, I recently had a problem with posting to
the cypherpunks list; it consisted of the message getting sent to anon.penet.fi
instead. This looks like someone trying to find out anon.penet.fi anon IDs;
however, it wouldn't work due to the password requirement. Have you heard
anything about this? Please forward this to the list if you would; I can't
exactly do so myself until the problem is resolved. I've let Julf know via
the help address, but he hasn't gotten back to me yet - probably because I
sent it Friday.
	-Allen
