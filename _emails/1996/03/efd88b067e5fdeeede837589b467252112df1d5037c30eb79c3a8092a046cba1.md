Just got back from doing some consulting in Europe.  In the Zurich airport,
there was a large illuminated sign (near the business class lounges) that
proclaimed:

Reliable cipher systems for absolute telecom protection

TST 7790
Secure telephone, sat phone, ISDN

TST 5573 F/U
Fax ciphering

TST 5573C
Data ciphering with 10 EXP 80 Key

TST 4045
HF SSB krypto modem

TST 8010
Spread spectrum transceiver

TST
TeleSecurity Timmann
Timman Gmbh
Lutzing, Germany

Full color photos of all of the above products were displayed.

No technical details on the cryptosystems being used, but quite refreshing,
considering the current state of things in the good old US of A...
