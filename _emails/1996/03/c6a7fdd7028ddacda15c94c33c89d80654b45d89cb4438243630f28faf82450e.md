In suggesting key:// urls, I (without commenting) placed a path of
/s/telnetd/ in a URL.  I was considering that a telnetd might need
many keys and associated documents, all of which could be found in a
directory.

	gateway's master telnetd public key.
	daily keys
	policy statements about who may connect, or how
	etc

I expect that we could extend the syntax in such a way that a URL
could contain most of the data we need.  Thus, the default document
might be a 'cert of the day,' with possibly with references within the
certificate to the master telnetd key, the hosts master key.

	To expand, I was thinking of:

	key://foo.bar.com/{u,s,h,d}/family/instance

	The first two bits, the scheme (key) and host are pretty
clear.  They're followed by an (arbitrary) grouping, of User, System,
Host or Domain.

	User is for user space certificates, such as personal
certs, or possibly currently in use IPv6 keys.  System is for system
daemons, such as telnetd.  Host is for host certificates, such as
might be generated for a host to sign its daemon's keys.  Domain could
be analogous to host, but for an entire domain.

	Family is for natural groupings, such as telnetd or adam, or
within a domain, certificates by host.  An thus a host's certificates
would be available under h/main/cert.asc or d/mailhost/cert.asc.  It
would be possible to extend this by date, to
d/mailhost/96/march/cert.asc

	Instance would then be the particular certificate, in a
standardized namespace.

	These are no longer particularly short in the verbose version,
but they are capable of being optimized (by ommission) for the usual
cases.
