Derek is correct in that your use of the words "uncrackable" and
"immune to fraud" were a bit over the top (in recent years everyone
in the security and crypto community has become very nervous whenever
anyone says things like this; they are usually trying to sell you
something which is neither.)  OTOH, he might want to temper his
statement with a reference to fail-stop signatures...  Just because
someone with a lot of computational resources can produce a private
key which matches your public key does not necessarily mean that
they are the same ones that you generated, only that they found a
set which work for the particular modulus which was chosen...

In the "real world" there is nothing to prevent someone from forging
your real signature on a check or document or from disguising themselves
as you and taking your place at an important business meeting.  The
digital equivalents can be slightly more secure, but nothing is ever
perfect.
