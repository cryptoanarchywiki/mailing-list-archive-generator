	You'd put something into the mail message itself that would tell it
"don't encrypt this" and/or "don't sign this". Hmm... you'd need to put in
messages to be signed and/or encrypted your passphrase, or have it gotten some
other way... which doesn't look very safe.
	Of course, if you're just encrypting it to the person's public key off
of your keyring, and for stuff that's coming in encrypted to someone else's
private key or signed with someone else's private key on your keyring, that
wouldn't be so much of a problem. For the stuff coming in with the
verification message (could be spoofed), looking for such strings already in
an incoming message would be good. An attacker could still potentially slip
something in between the mail program and the proxy program, though - the same
problem as with the passphrase in the message.
