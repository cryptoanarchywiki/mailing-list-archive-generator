I agree with turning up the noise level. For a few weeks now I've been
using the following script:

	#!/bin/ksh
	while sleep `roll 1 7 1`000
	do
	    roll 1 10000 `roll 1 200 1` | "a chain of remailers back to me"
	done

I've deleted the actual command to do the remailing, since it is
homegrown. Back at this end, I recognise the incoming mail and throw it
away. So I never get to see it, but there is a steady stream of
encrypted traffic both in and out.

The "roll" command, by the way, is a perl script I picked up off the
net, and it is very handy to have around:

	#!/usr/bin/perl
	$low = $ARGV[0];
	$high = $ARGV[1];
	$count = $ARGV[2];
	$high = $high - $low + 1;

	# seed the random process, and generate a few to be thrown away.
	srand($$+time);
	for ($i = rand(1000)/50; $i >= 0; --$i) {
	    rand(1000);
	}

	# generate
	for ($i = 0; $i < $count; ++$i) {
		$v = int(rand($high)) + $low;
		print $v, "\n";
	}
