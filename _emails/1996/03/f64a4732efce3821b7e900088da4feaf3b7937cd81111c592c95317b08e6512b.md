Well, my did is an artist, and I have to say that you really have to 
consider the "human" aspects of it before you rattle off refusing 
contracts for art.  Artists do art because they think they're good at it, 
or prefer art as a career field more than any other, presumbably.  When 
you have to feed a) yourself b) your family, taking contracts seems that 
much more palatable.  I admit, I don't like it either, but, to use a far 
more philosophical arena, sometimes people make the sacrifices that they 
do ( in terms of integrity and pride ) for the long run.  Sometimes 
people feel they have no choice at any point in their lives.  Sometimes 
people have nothing BUT artistic integrity.  Those who take the latter 
often get the respect of other artists, but respecting one's example is not 
the same as following one's example; who knows how many years of 
suffering you have to go through before you make it, if you make it at 
all ( case in point; Van Gogh, who only sold 1 painting his entire life ).
This argument may not seem all too relevant to this forum until you 
consider integrity of information, and start to consider how much one is 
and is not willing to sacrifice to others, say the authorities or to a 
society, in the first place.  It becomes quite important then; admittedly 
in a roundabout way.
