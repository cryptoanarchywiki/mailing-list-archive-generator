There is little that can be done about this. There must be something in the
message to identify who it is intended to be read by. As someone else has
stated, you can always set up private keys to be used to send to you that
are different from your Public KeyID for cases where you want to hide your
identity or that of the party you are communicating with.

If you want to hide the recipient list, then send separate messages to each
recipient - each of which is only encrypted to that one respective
recipient.
