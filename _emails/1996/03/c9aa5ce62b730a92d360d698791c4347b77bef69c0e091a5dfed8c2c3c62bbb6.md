Anyone know how secure the encryption is that Microsoft uses in its 
Access database product?  I was asked that by a client, but didn't know

"Past the wounds of childhood, past the fallen dreams and the broken families,
through the hurt and the loss and the agony only the night ever hears, is a
waiting soul.  Patient, permanent, abundant, it opens its infinite heart and
asks only one thing of you ... 'Remember who it is you really are.'"
