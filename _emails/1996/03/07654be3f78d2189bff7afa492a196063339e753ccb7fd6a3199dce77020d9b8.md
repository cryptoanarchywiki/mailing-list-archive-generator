One thing to remember, this is still a developing program. With the
increasing of bandwith and the development of new and better compression
algorithyms, this will slowly fade. This is only the begining. In a couple
years, the transmision and reception could be as good, if not better than
the normal telephone, you never know.

didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came
for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak
up because I wasn't a trade unionist.  Then they came for
Catholics, and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant.
Then they came for me-and by that time no one was left to
speak up..." Pastor Martin Niemoller
