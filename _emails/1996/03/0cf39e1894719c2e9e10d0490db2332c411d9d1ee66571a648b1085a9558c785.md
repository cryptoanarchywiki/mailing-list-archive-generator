Look, newbie, there are many people here who would be happy to review your
algorithm, but playing silly games like you are doing isn't going to win
you any points.  Most of the people on this list don't even use messydos,
so an exe file without source is kinda pointless.  If you're serious about
writing a secure crypto application, then stop giving us the runaround and
get to the point.  That means either post source code, or a thorough
technical description of your algorithm.
