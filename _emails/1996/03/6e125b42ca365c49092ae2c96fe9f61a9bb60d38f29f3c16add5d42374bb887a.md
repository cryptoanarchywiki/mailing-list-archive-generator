Ok, we'll skip the list. They probably don't care about this nit picking.

I did read it the first time around. Very carefully, since I was already
debugging the program he was talking about. He wrote " the VB program
decrypts any PGP mail it sees," and I believe that decryption requires a
user interface for the pass phrase.

But I think that Mike can speak for himself on the list. Let's end this
discussion about what he meant.  We obviously interpreted his idea differently.
