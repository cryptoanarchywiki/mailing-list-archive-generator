If you really believe that, then what happens when "they" argue that crypto 
keys MUST be kept, because if they are not kept they can't be subpoenaed?  
If a manufacturer proposes building a crypto telephone where no keys are 
kept after they call ends, then it seems to me that he'd be accused of 
thwarting some "right" to courts' access to keys.  

If you disagree with this line of reasoning, then why did you say that last 
line above?  Read it carefully; remember, you wrote it.
