I've recently been looking into this as well. I haven't looked at ISODE
yet. Snacc looks reasonable, but can't handle big integers (> 2^32), which
may make it hard to use for certificates, due to embedded RSA keys; I
haven't yet checked to see what could be done about this. It's free; the
compiler is under the GNU license, but the runtime is redistributable
without fee or onerous restriction.

I also spoke to a company in NJ, Open Systems Solutions (609.987.9073), but
their licensing terms were too expensive for my purposes. Their product
runs on a lot of platforms and sounds very complete, but requires a
licensed run-time environment. They currently support C and Pascal; C++ is
coming. Their development environment starts at $11,500.

I'm also searching for an ASN.1 product. We can afford to pay for a
compiler, but we need unrestrained distribution of the runtime in source
form. Any information would be greatly appreciated.

You may wish to examine the ASN.1 homepage @:
