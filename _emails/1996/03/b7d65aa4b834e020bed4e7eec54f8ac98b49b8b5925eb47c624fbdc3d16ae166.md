I do soho consulting and I help provide several of my customers with
software of various nature. One thing I have come to realize is that they
are not interested in being in the fast lane. They are secure in knowing
that the software behaves in a predicible way (not necessarily designed that
way either). A large part of this attitude is based in their not being
computer anything sorts. I find CD's a great way to keep libraries of old
software that sometimes comes in handy.

Yes, except it is much easier to track my access to the web than my CD-Rom.

CD's are great advertising.
