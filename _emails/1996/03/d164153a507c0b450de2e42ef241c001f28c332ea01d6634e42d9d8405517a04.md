Well, you're arguing in apparent favor of a segment of a bill which CHANGES 
current law.  Moreover, you're suggesting that we should trust the 
government's biased future interpretation of the ambiguous wording.  Since 
that clause doesn't really have to be there for the rest of the bill to 
stand by itself, I'd say it's fairly obvious that the burden of proof is on 
you.  I'm arguing, on the other hand, that there is danger in ambiguity, and 
there is!

Please note my more recent commentary to "all" where I point out that it is 
the INFORMATION which is to be "in furtherance of a felony," not the action 
of the person doing the encryption.  Like I pointed out, the sentence is not 
diagrammed, but I think it's fair to conclude that knowledge of the details 
of the information is unnecessary to be guilty under this section of the 
bill, merely the fact that you're using encryption to hide SOMETHING WHICH 
_MIGHT_ BE INFORMATION "IN FURTHERANCE OF A FELONY."

We're getting into pretty dangerous territory, I think.

They used to prosecute conspiracies when there was no crime!  Did you know 
that?  In the late 1800's, it was not illegal for a worker to endeavour to 
have his salary increased, but union membership ("a conspiracy") was ILLEGAL!
In other words, a conspiracy to do a legal thing was illegal.

I seriously doubt it.  I haven't gotten a response from Mr. Safdar, yet, 
which I consider to be suspicious.  If he's confident of his position he'll 
back up his interpretation with whatever legal advice he used to decide on 
his original support.  My guess is that he simply read the bill in a sloppy 
fashion, jumped to the conclusion that the writers of the bill hoped we'd 
do, and wrote up his support without a lawyer's advice.

Yes, it was a "travesty."  But it was a travesty because the people involved 
simply didn't care whether what they did looked kosher to the average 
BBS/net user, and figured the average citizen wouldn't care.

Not if I have my way about it.  I assume you are aware that I'm the author 
and primary proponent of my "Assassination Politics" essay.  I consider it 
essentially inevitable.  Moreover, with the exception of a few killings done 
by perfectly anonymous people, it should be entirely legal by current 
black-letter law.  This should eventually eliminate the ability of the 
government to cause the kind of outrages we've all heard about,  such as the 
SJ Games case, Amateur Action case, and of course Waco and Ruby Ridge, along 
with many others.  Once adopted, any government employee who pisses off even 
a tiny fraction of the population would either resign or die, or both, and 
you'd never have to wonder whether a government-hired murderer would get 
away with his crimes.

You need to understand that long before I started publicizing this idea, I 
was fully aware that the government would have to do something to prevent 
this from happening:  They'd have to write new laws to make crimes out of 
things that were not formerly crimes.  I believe that they are trying to do 
exactly this with this new law:  What they want to do is to be able to 
prosecute people who are doing nothing more than collecting "bets" and 
paying off "winners" in a "lottery" that government employees can only lose, 
fatally.

In short, the government is trying to head off "crypto-anarchy," which I 
guess is Tim May's trademark.  I suggest that we don't allow them to; it 
will merely make the government's eventual end even bloodier.

You shouldn't use the example of a "reporter."  See, due to the 1st 
amendment (and the fact that news organizations are rich and influential) 
the law tends to defer to the media in situations where it shouldn't.  For 
example, a reporter can usually refuse to give sources for information, but 
ordinary citizens can't refuse to testify against other people in an 
analogous way.  (I'm not saying the reporter should be forced to testify; 
I'm saying the average citizen should NOT be!)   Citing the example of a 
reporter is therefore misleading, because you could be correct about the 
current interpretation in that instance  but not if you tried to apply this 
analogy to the operator of an anonymous remailer.

Again, your example is misleading.  Manfacturers and suppliers of goods and 
services that are rich and have been around a long time have hired lobbyists 
to get politicians to formulate laws that are "friendly" to their particular 
business.  Anonymous remailers, on the other hand, have little budget, none 
for lobbying, and they have no "history" of court cases that back up their 
rights in these matters.  Cite all the cases you want from "smokestack 
America" and it'll get you nowhere:  Juries may sympathize with car rental 
places (who at least do a credit check on their customers, BTW) but there's 
no guaranteee they'll sympathize with a remailer whose "only" function is to 
disguise the source of a message.

Well, so far, a number of organizations seem to have fallen for this bill.  
Most of them are smart enough to be worried about this section, but the 
problem is that they are not aware of how bad the problems are.  They have 
no imagination; they don't try to answer the question, "How can this law be 
abused?"

If you've already admitted that the Amateur Action BBS case was a 
"travesty," then how in the world can you call me "paranoid"?    As the 
saying goes, "You're not paranoid if the ARE out to get you!"

It doesn't take "all" of them to be thugs for a bill such as this to be 
abused.  The scum rises to the top, or floats to the bottom.

In the "middle" of what?  The public?  Or a few self-interested politicians? 
 If it's the latter, I'd say "fuck 'em!"  If the only way they'll pass the 
rest of the bill is to have that portion of the bill there, then they must 
think that portion of the bill is REAL IMPORTANT!   And if they think that, 
you need to ask yourself WHY is it so important to them?

Sorry, but _I_ know why it's so important to them; the power and even their 
very lives are on the line.

Who "deserves it"?  And why wouldn't you be satisfied with convicting them
of whatever crime they are presumably already guilty of?!?

That's the problem:  These kinds of cases are often not well publicized.  
People like you get a vastly over-optimistic view of "the law" when you 
don't know the distances the thugs will go to persecute and prosecute people.

Question:  let's suppose the wording of this section of this bill CAN be 
"used to the ridiculous extreme"?  If we presume that the people who wrote 
this bill were intelligent and knew what they wanted, why would not not 
conclude that "the ridiculous extreme" is EXACTLY what they wanted?  And if 
that's the case, then we'd damn well better figure out just how "ridiculous" 
those extremes are!

I've already pointed out that "the average citizen" is unaffected by crime 
whose investigation can be "thwarted" by the use of encryption.  You're 
going to have to explain why such a section is even there: Who is it going 
to appease, and why?

The reason I can't "sell this premise to everyone in Congress" is that it is 
exactly those people who are the problem!   And my solution involves either 
535 resignation letters or 535 coffins, whichever.  And they are reacting 
predictably.

That might be the "realistic" position, but it's a position which assumes 
that the government employees have their own agenda and interests, and will 
act on those interests and against those of the average citizen.  This is 
certainly true, obviously, but that is exactly where the problem lies!
