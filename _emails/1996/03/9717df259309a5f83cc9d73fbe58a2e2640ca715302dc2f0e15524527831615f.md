Right, and I've cited this "family law" case recently here in Cyphepunks as
an example of an aberrant, unconstitutional law (family law has a lot of
such things...it may come from the hard-to-untangle situation of a family).

I don't take specific statutes or interpretations, such as this example, as
being the same as what the Constitution says. Though it may come to the
point where what's in the Constitution is buried under a blizzard of such
exceptions and special cases.

In any case, I think the First Amendment is a better protection of
cryptographic rights than is some putative (and arguably nonexistent)
"right to privacy."
