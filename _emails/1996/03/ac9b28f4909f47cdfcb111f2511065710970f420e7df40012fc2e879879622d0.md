Well, it turns out  that (according to a nice  person at SurfWatch who
put up with the rant    I mailed in   and send  back a denial   rather
quickly) io.com isn't  actually blocked.  At least, so  they say.   No
comment on whether there's anything like the "25 complaints" policy.

I don't own SurfWatch, but if anybody does and finds www.io.com
blocked, I'll send in another rant.

I wonder whether they've actually considered the liability situation
in re: blocking sites that shouldn't be blocked?    I mean, sure, they
seem nice enough about setting things right (like with the Nynex sites
whose url's had "xxx" in the paths), but it seems to this non-lawyer
that a case could be made for damages inflicted by being known as a
purveyor of filthy indecency for even a short while.
