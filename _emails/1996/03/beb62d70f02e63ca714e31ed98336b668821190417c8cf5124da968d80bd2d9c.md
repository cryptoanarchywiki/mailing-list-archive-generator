Be wary.  There are people who believe gun or ammo manufacturers (and
even knife manufacturers) should be held responsible for criminal use
of their products.  Bartenders or party hosts are already responsible
when one of their patrons or guests gets too drunk (though the connection
with knowing that the person is wasted is a bit clearer there.)

The people who support such liabilities think there is a clear connection
and it isn't very good.

You may as well argue about religion or how many angels can fit on the
head of a pin with such people.  They go by emotional arguments, in many
cases because they've a personal connection as or with a victim of some
crime.
