   3-26-96. WSJ:

   "SEC Says Brewery May Use Internet to Offer Its Stock."

      The episode is extraordinary in that it shows the power
      of the Internet to free companies from their traditional
      market limitations, says Spring Street President
      Andrew Klein, who says. "My phone's been ringing off 
      the hook from companies that want to know how they can 
      sell a piece of their companies to the public using 
      this technology, without paying underwriters or 
      brokers and without having to give the company away 
      to venture capitalists."
