-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I'm wondering if anyone has done any work on schemes to lower the
entropy of a given stream.  Why?  Save you've got message M encrypted
with a good cipher, but you're worried that it can be detected because
even with stego, the entropy is a lot higher than normal 'random' data
flowing through a network.

So it seems possible to create a scheme that given a key will take a
block of n bits and expand it to 1.5n or 2n bits, recoding it in such
a way that determining the key is difficult even if one suspects such
a scheme has been used... but that using the scheme will make the data
look more like the MSBs of graphical data rather than encrypted data.
