The latest version of NOISE.SYS (0.4.9) should be available "real 
soon now" at ftp.elf.stuba.sk in the ??/security directory [I don't 
remember the exact path...].

It should also be available at the ftp.wimsey.com and ftp.funet.fi 
sites soon.

NOISE.SYS is a /dev/random driver for DOS systems, similar to the 
random.c implementation for Linux and FreeBSD.  It sets up two 
devices, "random" and "urandom" which return streams of crypto- 
quality random bytes based on fast timings from the keyboard IRQ, 
disk access, Windows 3.x message broadcasts, mouse movement, and cpu 
clock drift, with some experimental kluges to sample the audio card 
input [to be improved in future versions].  The raw samples are mixed 
using a polynomial function and then hashed using SHA-1.  Entropy 
estimation is based on arithmetic coding schemes and how often 
samples recur, rather than on the sample deltas themselves.

The source is included (in 386 assembler) and is relatively easy to 
modify and experiment with [plenty of comments and macros].
