A few questions:

1- How does the PC know where it is?
2- How does the PC know it has been stolen?

Since this is a software product I am assuming that the answer to #1
is the use of CallerID on the line when the software calls, which is
defeated by the use of line blocking by the thief.  The obvious answer
to #2 seems to me to have the system call the CompuTrace office at
odd intervals to see if it has been reported stolen yet...

Obvious solution for potential thieves: wipe the disks and reinstall
an OS once you steal a PC.  This should be done anyway to remove any
bits of data which might identify the original owner.

Conclusion:  Yet another useless piece of software riding the
computer security bandwagon.
