Uh, Rich?...

You've probably been detweiled by Detweiler himself.

Someone around here has a concordance program, called MEDUSA, if I remember

My hunch is that this particular "anonymous" is LD himself. I take my hint
from this line:

All this and the fact that he now wants to convert his name into a verb.
