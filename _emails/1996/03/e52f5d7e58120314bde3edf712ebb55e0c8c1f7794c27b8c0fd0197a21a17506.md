s-tools is an audio stego utility(s), but I've not used it.

As for testing methods, noise spheres are an interesting graphical method
for testing randomness (check the archives from late Dec/early Jan, I
posted a short Turbo Pascal program that implements them).

I'm not entirely sure if noise spheres will capture any crypto-relevant
correlations, but it seems worth investigating.

The reference to the article on noise spheres and other graphical methods
for testing PRNGs is:

  Pickover, Clifford A. 1995. "Random number generators: pretty good
     ones are easy to find."  The Visual Computer (1995) 11:369-377.
