Maybe nobody is selling phone service, and the internet provider is
selling packet-transfer service, but phone service _is_ being provided.
One possible response would be for the FCC to require internet providers to
block phone connections (highly unlikely; you could offer the service
on any port you wanted, and I think one of the versions runs over IRC);
another would be for them to block the sale of the software (tough
to block sale of Israeli software, much less free software.)

Bogus.
