By this, do you mean that just the API will be released (which we had
pretty much finalized in mid-January), or actual code to go with it?

They've had far too much time to add wrappers to their existing ecash
client to turn it into a library.  I hope that (very soon) we see a
properly-implemented libecash; however, that's unlikely, since no one
has discussed a low-level API yet...
