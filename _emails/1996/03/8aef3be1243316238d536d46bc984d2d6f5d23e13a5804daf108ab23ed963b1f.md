FYI, just saw the following scheduled (at least here in Tucson) on PBS for
Friday night, 3/23:

_Firing Line_ debate
Resolved: The Government Has the Right to Regulate the Internet
"A current communications controversy fuels the proposed resolution in the
latest installment of William F. Buckley Jr.'s recurring series, in which
participants debate whether the Internet should be federally regulated.
Among those arguing for it with Buckley are Arianna Huffington and Reid
Hoffman; those against it include Susan Estrich and John Perry Barlow."
