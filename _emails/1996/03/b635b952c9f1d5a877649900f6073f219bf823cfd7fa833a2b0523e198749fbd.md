No copy of this program has arrived in my mailbox, which is a good thing.
I am no cryptography expert. Even _I_, however, see massive problems in
letting _others_ generate my crypto-keys for me. If this egomaniac gets
the respected experts on this list to review his software at no cost, &
if the experts actually say, "he's right, it's unbreakable," the system
will still have this weakness. This is even worse than the "Power One
Time Pad" snakeoil. Am I missing something?
