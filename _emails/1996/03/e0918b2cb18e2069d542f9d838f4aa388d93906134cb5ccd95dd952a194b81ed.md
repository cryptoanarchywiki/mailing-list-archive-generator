Hmm thats not what I meant - I just envisioned giving all the recipient
public keys to pgp and saying letting it do the rest.  This does result in
all recipients gettingthe key fingerprints of all other recipients which is
not a problem in my application.

Alan goes on to suggest sumthing very similar except that he does not
decrypt the body first - which apart from meaning I'd have to hack pgp
acheives the same effect.

The overal intent was to have a message go from one list member to all
others with a) a signature to provide strong attribution and a measure of
non repudiation b) low probability of interception c) only the gateway has
to have all the public keys.  

Inbound the process looks like this:
        decrypt and validate signature (leaving original signature)
        add gateway info (sender signature validation, date received etc)
        sign the whole thing with the gateway key.
        crypt with all list member keys (i.e. one message readable by any
member)
        send to members.

Several people have pointed me at PGPdomo which I now have a copy of and
will be looking at as a basic for this (assuming it's not an exact fit
already).\
