For those of you in the NYC area, I'm presenting a forum next week on
"Political Life in Cyberspace" (not my title).  I'm going to skip the
boring net-boosterism and talk mainly about several bleak scenarios I've
been thinking about for the past year or two: the imminent death of the
net, the impossibility of digital privacy, and various impending threats,
like government/corporate crackdowns on privacy, the disneyfication of the
net and conversion to a digital Home Shopping Network, Alta Vista and the
increase in dossiers, etc.  If I'm in a good mood, I may also talk about
how a very close friend of mine was fired for making "unflattering remarks"
about her employer on the cypherpunks list.

Here are the details:


                         Date: Tuesday, March 12
       Place: The Brecht Forum, 122 West 27 St., 10th Floor (NYC)
                             Time: 8:00 p.m.
                    Price: FREE (donation requested)
