Just what George Will said about this recent Bennis SC decision.

Ditto, and I notice you give no specific examples.  Why is that?

Again, you give no specific examples.  And what is "twisted rhetoric", at 
least as you've used it here?

>but you don't seem to know the difference between dicta and holdings.

I didn't use either term.  Neither did George Will.

Maybe you read that item too rapidly to notice that most of it was George 
Will's column, not my wording.  

BTW, I get particularly suspicious when people "respond" 
to my posts and quote NOTHING that I have said.  This seems to be a pattern: 
 The person clearly disagrees with my position in general, but can't cite 
specifics and in fact studiously avoids them.  Padgett Peterson is an expert 
at this, it appears you're trying to emulate him. 

What, then, was the point of sending me the note, as well as wasting 
bandwidth on CP to share your unhappiness?
