Yeah, didn't you know that Sameer was on the CIA payroll? How do you 
think he paid for his new Ferrari?

I have no doubt that the CIA can break 1000-bit keys on a case-by-case
basis, *if they decide to allocate the resources*. I think it's possible
that some remailers are run by spooks. However, I seriously doubt that
anyone is breaking stuff routinely, and I think the web of trust is pretty
good. Of course, the CIA had Ames... the reverse could easily be true. 

However, I also have no doubt that Strassmann and Marlow are spreading
disinformation and exaggerating their capabilities in an attempt to break
the web of trust and incite a witch hunt. It won't work. The answer in any
case is more use of remailers, not less. Just turn up the noise level. 
You already know that nothing is 100% secure, but you do what you can. 
It's a war of attrition.
