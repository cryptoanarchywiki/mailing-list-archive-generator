The phone companies have dealt with this kind of problem for years.  For
example, there are issues of phase jitter and bit error rate that they deal
with all the time.  If anything, they don't quite understand the email type
communication of, "Oh, anytime in the next 10 minutes, and tell me if it
doesn't get thru and I'll send it again."

In ATM, these characteristics are bundled into what is called Quality of
Service.  That, along with bandwidth, make a reasonable basis for charging.
 Email is a bit like flying standby, while video is more like the Concorde.
 IMHO, the only long-term solution to the problem of bandwidth allocation
involves markets.  Markets feed cost information back to the users and give
the providers incentive to improve service.
