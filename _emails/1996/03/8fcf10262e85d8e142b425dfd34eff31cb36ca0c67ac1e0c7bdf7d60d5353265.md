In order to add a symbolic link on a file system, you have to have shell
access to that system.  The whole point of this anonymous web pages thread
is that web pages could be distributed among different servers which could
store the pages on the filesystem and make access available through the
web.  An attacker could not put a link to the password file simply through
anonymous web pages.  Besides, password file should be shadowed anyway, and
httpd should never be run as root.
