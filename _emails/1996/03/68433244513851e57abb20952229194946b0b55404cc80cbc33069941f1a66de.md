The number of prime numbers less than n is n/ln(n).  Presumably the number
of valid PGP keys is somewhat larger.

Assume 768 bit PGP keys: 

The number of randomly selected 768 bit primes that you would need for a
reasonable chance of a birthday collision is 1.708E104

Which is 

170 800 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 

A number substantially larger than 
3 153 600 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
