Greetings Cypherpunks:

I have no idea if this is the appropriate place or way to broach this
topic, but I have a great deal of space on my account that is just
going to waste. I am allowed a www page, and in a couple of weeks my
shell space quota will be upgraded to 20 meg, with anon ftp
capability. 

As I said, this is just going to waste, so I was wondering if anyone
had some faqs, files, or whatever that they wanted to distribute or if
anyone needed space for a web page. Frankly, I've never written an
html document, but I suppose I could learn.

Please respond directly, as I'm sure that the rest of the list doesn't
want to hear the responses.
