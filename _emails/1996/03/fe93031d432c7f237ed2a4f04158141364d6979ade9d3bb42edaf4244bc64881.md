Huh? Postscript an "obscure printer code"?

You are on drugs, whomever you are. Matt and company have done some
very interesting work here on certificate policies. The work is
unpatented and involves no proprietary AT&T technology. In short, you
are both an stupid and paranoid. You probably didn't understand what
you were reading.

If you had a milligram of self respect, you'd come out from behind
that anonymous remailer. Of course, I expect that you know that your
words are embarassing rather than something to be proud of.

The paper in question is seminal. I strongly urge people who don't
drool when they open their mouths to read it.
