Hello, All!

I was just thinking about how to generate random numbers,
when I hit upon an interesting idea:

If the internet is so huge and complex, why not, say, use 
the least significant bits of ping times from random internet 
hosts as seeds for a PRNG? (Practical Random Number Gen.)

You could then break the resulting binary value into 128-bit
blocks and modulus/xor each with a stream of random numbers taken
from a keyboard timing.

After all this, you could wash it with a secure symmetric 
cryptosystem such as idea in CBC mode.

Any thoughts, comments?
