The bsdi-isps, bsdi-users, bsdi-users-d, xconq, humor, cheapnet, and
cypherpunks-d mailing lists have been down since Saturday night at about
8:00pm Eastern. 

The systems handling these mailing lists are now trying to get out from 
under the load, and normal operation should resume within 24 hours (I hope).

(The primary mail machine for gateway.com is currently running at a load 
average of 19.8 and still puffing)
