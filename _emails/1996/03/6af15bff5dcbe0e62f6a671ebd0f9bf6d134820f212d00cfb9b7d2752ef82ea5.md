There is a way to beat this--generate new public keys on a frequent basis,
and send them to whoever wants to send you absolutely anonymous mail in
encrypted form.  Have your anonymous partner do likewise.  Since the key ID
is fairly random, if it changes constantly, it will be irrelevant if it shows
up in a message only once.  Keep a separate (and temporary) key ring for
these temporary public keys, so you can delete the key ring files when they
start getting too large.
