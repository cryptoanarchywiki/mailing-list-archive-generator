A few questions concerning the access to crypto
software from foreigners living in the US: 

- Suppose that an ISP (or a University) provides an account to
a foreigner (i.e. the foreigner can access a few UNIX machines
that are property of the ISP). Suppose now that PGP (for
example) is installed on these machines, then the ISP expose
the foreigner to crypto software, right? Is the ISP (or
University) punishable by law?   

- Which version of PGP is the foreigner allowed to use in the
US? He would violate export restriction if he uses the US
version and he would violate the RSA copyrights if he uses
the internation version, right? 

- What if the foreigner actually write crypto code while in
the US? Does he (or the Uni/ISP) violate export restrictions each 
time he access the source code or execute his program if they are 
stored on a public (Uni/ISP) machine?
