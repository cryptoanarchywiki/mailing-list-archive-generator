Back over 20 years ago, some acquaintances at the time stopped working in
the drug trade because it became necessary to carry fire arms to protect
against having your drugs or money stolen.  Other people of course carried
the guns, and I assume used them at times.  This violence would not have
occurred had the drug trade been legal.

Remember that here in California, about 70% of the people think killing
someone is a suitable punishment for certain crimes.  Many people also
think that violence in defense of life or property is a reasonable act. 
Are all these people "deranged"?
