If I want a remailer's key, I would probably try to go after root.  Not
only will it get me that key, but there's no telling what else might
turn up in the meantime.  If you can get access to any account on the
system, odds are good you can give yourself root access anyway.  It's
almost a "freebie."

You could always do a custom-compile of PGP that never checks for a passphrase;
it's compiled into the executable.  That's only a trivial measure at best
(heck, hex editors have been around since roughly the dawn of UNIX) but
it's a place to start.

I don't think it's possible to have too much security.
