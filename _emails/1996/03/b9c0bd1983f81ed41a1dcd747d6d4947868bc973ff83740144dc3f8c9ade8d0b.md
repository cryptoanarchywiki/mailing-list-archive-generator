I've *finally* had a chance to try and catch up on my CyP (vice CoP) reading, including the running tit-for-tat between Jim Bell and (most of) the rest of the list.

While Mr. Bell's Assassination Politics idea has a lot of interesting ramifications, I've found that his apparent in-your-face-and-wha'cha-gonna-do-about-it-PUNK attitude makes reading his postings very tedious.

Perhaps if 'we' were to simply read his postings, and respond *only* to those that maintain a civil tone, it would finally sink in with him that his Terrible Two's antics aren't appreciated.

The only other options I see are:
        Someone gets his snailmail address and sends him a Dale Carnegie book, or
        there's a mass kill-filing, with him as the guest of (dis)honor.

As noted, his AP idea seems worth discussing, I'd be reluctant to lose it. I'd hate to see him turned into LD-2 (Son of LD? :-) because he doesn't seem to have learned Tact and Manners yet.
