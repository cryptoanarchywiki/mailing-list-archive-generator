The VENONA Project

In July 1995 the Intelligence Community ended a 50-year silence regarding
one of cryptology's most splendid successes - the VENONA Project. VENONA was
the codename used for the U.S. Signals Intelligence effort to collect and
decrypt the text of Soviet KGB and GRU messages from the 1940's. These
messages provided extraordinary insight into Soviet attempts to infiltrate
the highest levels of the United States Goverment. 

Today, we are proud to offer these exceptional documents on the NSA home
page and we invite you to study and interpret them in the context of
history. NSA will declassify over 2200 messages related to VENONA. We
believe they will not only provide a window into Soviet espionage during the
1940's, but will also give you a glimpse of the important contributions
signals intelligence and cryptographic expertise make to our nation's security.
