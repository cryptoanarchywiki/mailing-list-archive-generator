There are two versions of the Zip drive.  One is SCSI and one is Parallel
faking scsi.

The big problem is with the zip drivers.  There is some sort of
incompatibility between SFS and the zip drivers.  (I hacked on it for a
couple of hours with no luck.)  Win95 makes the problem worse, as it is
difficult to judge just when the driver for the zip drive loads.  (I have a
number of complaints about the zip drive drivers.  Lack of documentation is
one of them...)

Sometime I will have to fire up SoftICE and see exactly what the conflict is...
