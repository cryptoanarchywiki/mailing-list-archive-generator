A diary isn't illegal... but if you are suspected or even convicted 
of a crime, and there's reason to believe that a book or computer 
file is a diary and that you wrote about more crimes in the diary, 
then it's worth investigating.

Just as if one is suspected of money laundering and it is known that 
that person has Swiss or Cayman Island bank accounts... having them 
doesn't mean one is guilty, but if there is other evidence that the 
crime took place then they are well within the realm of 
investigating.

No. It's just another area of potential evidence.

One can argue that, yes. In fact I remember some LE type who was 
pro-crypto who insisted the DT Bill was for lazy cops who didn't want 
to do the footwork necessary for an investigation.

Another is when they cited the World Trade Ctr bombing... seems they 
already had a handle that it was in the works and did nothing anyway. 
DT or a crypto-ban or GAK would not have prevented that.

And in some ways one has less rights when in contempt of court then 
when convicted of a felony....

Ideally, that is how the system works.  But if they have a good 
reason to suspect something is evidence (and in the above pedaphile 
ase a file named "diary.pgp" would probably qualify) a warrant can be 
obtained.

Note that just having PGP-encrypted files would not necessarily be 
evidence either.  They pointed out a specific file with specific 
reasons why it should be examined.

It's not clear in terms of court rulings whether handing over 
decryption keys is self-incrimination or not.  From what I have 
heard, the courts do not view safe combinations as 
self-incriminating...

Doesn't mean it won't...

Good point indeed. "We have nothing to fear but fear itself." (Flames 
for an FDR quote from raving anti-socialists will be bounced to 
/dev/null.)
