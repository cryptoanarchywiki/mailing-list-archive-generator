Indeed, I've found that pretty much covers the essentials :-)
First things I've always tried to learn in a foreign language are "please"
and "thank you".

Sounds much similar to the reaction I got in Japan, speaking broken
Japanese. Atrocious accent, of course; abysmal grammar, and a fair share of
mispronunciation tossed in - but I was *trying*, and that counted for a _lot_.

I also have to concur with the point about the language/point-of-view
argument. I never have learned to _think_ in a foreign language (a
prerequisite for fluency, I believe :-), but have gotten sufficiently
skilled to be able to understand some of the subtleties of the languages
I've (kind of) learned.

Regarding the notoriety of British (and, yes, Americans), I met up with a
Brit in Japan who complained about the 'bloody foreigners that don't
understand proper English'. I pointed out to him that *we* were the
foreigners, and that the Japanese had a nicely organized society about the
same time that his ancestors and mine were still smearing themselves with
blue mud. That earned me an Evil Look.
