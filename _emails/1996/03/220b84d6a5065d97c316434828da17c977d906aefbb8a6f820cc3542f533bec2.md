After I posted about it, I did a little more digging and checked out the
S-HTTP portion of the code.  Seems to work pretty well.  (I was a bit
surprised to see that the Personna cert generation saved the information off
in a text file, instead of using the bundled e-mail client.  The docs on
this process were pretty sketchy as well...)

My reasons for installing it had little to do with S-HTTP (but it was a nice
bonus) and more to do with the lack of table support.  (I needed something
to check out how pages would look on non-table supporting browsers.)

My concerns with S-HTTP are with the lack of server (and browser) software
support for it, as well as the difficulty of maintaining a site that uses
it.  (Having to change every single page on a site can become a bit of a
chore, as well as introduce unintended security holes due to in improperly
updated page.)
