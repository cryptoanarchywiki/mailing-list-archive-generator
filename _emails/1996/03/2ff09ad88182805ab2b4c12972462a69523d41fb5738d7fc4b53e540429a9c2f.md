On the contrary, I was thinking of a situation when a person is posting through
an anonymous remailer, yet wishes to establish a persistent nym that can't be
impersonated. E.g., someone may submit articles via remailers (different every
time) and have a signature 'Alice D. N.'; what's to prevent someone else from
submitting an article and also signing it 'Alice D. N.'?

I was thinking of allowing the user to add a 'From: <nym>' in the first
paragraph of the PGP-signed block. To establish the nym, Alice would first
post her public key under the name of Alice; then she would post things like

From: remailer@somewhere

-- begin pgp signed msg

From: Alice

...

This would also address the problem of someone's misconfigured system where
his submissions appear to come from moron@camelot.ptu.edu or
moron@pendragon.ptu.edu or some other random hostname.

P.S. So, when are you setting up your own mixmaster remailer, Igor? :-)
