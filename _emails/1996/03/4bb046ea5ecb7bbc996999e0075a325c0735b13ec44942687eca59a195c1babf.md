Actually they *are* using the technology -- digital networking.  They are
just keeping the markup.  It costs less that 2 cents a minute to produce a
New York to London call but AT&T charges me more than 50 cents a minute.
That sort of markup can't last.  They need more copetition.  Iphone is just
part of the disintermediation.
