The raindrop scheme was (politely) laughed off.  As for the fan recording
scheme, it's a good make-do-with-what-you-already-have method, as opposed
to buying and/or building a card.

A 'simple AD converter' isn't so simple.  Especially if you want to be
sure you really have random noise and not something else that just looks
random.
