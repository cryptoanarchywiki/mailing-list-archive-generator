Well, lets see. For a 1024 bit key, a birthday match is a 1 in 2^512
proposition, assuming that a key could be any random 1024 bit number.
Assuming 100 million planets:

100000000*(10^12)*(10^9)*60*60*24*365*(10^9)*(10^9)=
    3153600000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
2^512=
   134078079299425970995740249982058461274793658205923933777235614437217\
   640300735469768018742981669034276900318581864860508537538828119465699\
   46433649006084096

However, the density of prime numbers isn't so high as to make the
probability truly 1/2^512 -- indeed, I would guess it is much
lower. However, you may indeed be right.

None the less, one would hope that the software handled it gracefully
even if the impossible happened...
