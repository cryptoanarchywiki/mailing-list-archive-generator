That's Herr Reichsmarschall Unicorn to you.

I'd be happy to find other work.  High tax jurisdictions, welfare 
states, and overbearing jurisdiction are, however, unlikely to go away.

I also happen to be independently wealthy, and have been since far before 
I ever took up law.  All that stolen art from my Nazi associates you 
understand.

When my position is:  "Courts are likely to do this."  A cite is entirely 
appropriate.  I don't make public value judgements on the policies of the 
United States in the same way that I don't want the United States to 
impose it's view of "right" on Liechtenstein.

Don't, if you can at all help it, Mr. Bell, confuse recitation of current 
fact with philisophical support for a novel, or as the case may be, 
raving position.

Of course, I'm just a Nazi, so....

Which is why I provide more practical detours around the problems.

Readers will note that I do this without calling people Nazi's.

Abuse is in the eye of the beholder.  You are beginning to blur your 
useage of the word "abuse" as badly as you were complaining about the 
court's use of the word "malice."  But perhaps its just the 
national-socialist need for order in me that makes me say so.
