Q: What do you call an American company that ported its internet software 
to 22 different langauges in order to compete in the world?

A: Microsoft

So the question is: Who do you want as a neighbour and/or trading partner?

Actually, you promised me that you'd sign up to learn "Swedish. No, wait, 
to learn Polish. Or is it Japanese, or Greek, or Hindi, or...."

But why bother going to all that trouble. Everything you need to be able to 
encounter another language is right in front of you.

http://www.branchezvous.com could be one place to start.

But perhaps my point is misdirected. Even those who speak English and
share a similar culture can find it hard to communicate sometimes.
