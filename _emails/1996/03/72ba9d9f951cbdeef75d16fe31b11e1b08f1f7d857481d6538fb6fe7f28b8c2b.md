C'punks,

For the second (and last) time, the Bay Area Cypherpunks meeting
will be held at the offices of Simple Access, fourth floor, 388 
Market Street, San Francisco.  The meeting will be from noon to
6pm (or so) on Saturday, 9 March.  As of this notice, there is
no agenda.  (Funny, we never seem to be at a loss for words.)

Street parking is scarce, garages are expensive; consider public
transit.  If anyone wants BART, CalTrain or bus information, let
me know.  Otherewise, here are driving instructions:

PENINSULA

--North on 101 (or 280 to 101) to Golden Gate/Bay Bridge fork.

--Right on 80 (Bay Bridge, Oakland) to 4th St. exit.

--Take 4th St. exit.  

--At the bottom of the ramp, go sort of straight (soft left) 
  onto Bryant (parallel to 80, towards Bay).

--Take Bryant about 4 blocks to Fremont.

--Take Fremont about 5 blocks to Market.

--Follow instructions under "END GAME," below.

EAST BAY

--Take 80, west across the Bay Bridge to Fremont exit.

--Take exit and turn left on Fremont.

--Take Fremont about 2.5 blocks to Market.

--Follow "END GAME" instructions.

END GAME

--The building on the far-right corner is 388 Market.

--Find a place to park.

--Sign in at lobby desk.  You are going to visit Simple Access
  on the 4th floor.

--Take the elevator to 4 and follow the signs.

--The phone number is:  415-296-2544.
