If the Leahy bill is unacceptable, what legistlation is necessary? I 
can't see how the use of cryptography in the commission of a crime needs 
to be a separate offence, but I could see how it could be treated as a 
special circumstance - that doesn't really needed a new law though.

I do feel that it should be possible for courts to sub poena crypto keys, 
but that doesn't really need new law either (4th and 5th ammendments 
become _really_ important though (hmmm- there advantages to writing down a 
constitution after all :)
