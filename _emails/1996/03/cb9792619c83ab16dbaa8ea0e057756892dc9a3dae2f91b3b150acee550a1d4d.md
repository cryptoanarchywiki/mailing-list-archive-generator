Case in point.  I recently had a client ask me to locate a reference
implementation of SSL.  I fired up AltaVista and quickly found two of them.
 One was available thru Netscape, and the other was Eric Young's from
Australia.

Now, in good conscience, do I give them Netscape's non-exportable version,
or Eric's already exported version.  Of course I gave them Eric's.  They
were delighted since they can just point their foreign customers to Eric's
site and avoid the whole export issue.

I would like to publicly thank Eric for making his code available to US
sites.  I hope that this description, in some small way, helps to overcome
the idiocy of not being able to export what is already freely available
abroad.

Regards - Bill
