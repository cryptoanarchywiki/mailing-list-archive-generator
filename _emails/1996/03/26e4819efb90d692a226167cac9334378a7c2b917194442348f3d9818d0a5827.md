Well, actually, it depends on whether the bytes are treated as signed or
unsigned, and we don't know for sure that IPG wanted them treated as
unsigned. This means IPG either:

a) can't write portable code, or
b) really are as stupid as we are giving them credit for.

(I'm miffed at being left out of the game... sniff...)
