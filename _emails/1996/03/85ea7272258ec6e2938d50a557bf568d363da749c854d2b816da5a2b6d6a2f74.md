A couple of points:
1. DES is nonlinear and (I believe) provably not a group; that TET is
alluding to DES being linear casts grave doubt.  If their S-Box "permutes"
I'd also be concerned!

2. Most NEW UNPROVEN CRYPTOSYSTEMS are crap, not crypto products.  That's
too strong an assertion.  Plenty of commercial crypto products(and perhaps
"most" which in significant commercial disctribution) are based on strong
DES/RSA, etc. proven technologies.
