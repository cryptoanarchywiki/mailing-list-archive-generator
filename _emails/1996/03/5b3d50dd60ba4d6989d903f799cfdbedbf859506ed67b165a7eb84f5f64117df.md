Thank you, Mr. Junger, for your entire analysis, but particularly this 
comment on that atrocious section.   I'm repeating it, because I think it 
bears vast significance to the problems with this bill. 

The bill needs a complete rewrite.  

The one thing that makes me hopeful is the fact that the people around here 
who seem to think that this bill must be accepted as written, with this 
section included, all claim that there is great opposition to it.  If that 
is true, then all I need to do is to convince people who nominally should be 
on "our" side that the bill is bad, as written.  Mr. Junger's careful, 
albeit prelimary analysis does that in spades.
