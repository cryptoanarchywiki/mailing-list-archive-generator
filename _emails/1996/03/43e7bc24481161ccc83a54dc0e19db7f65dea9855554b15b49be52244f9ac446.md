With the Ecash API due to be released within a matter of days, I would
welcome anyone on this list interested in building applications on top of
such an API to contact me. The API will determine the calls to a libecash
that DigiCash will provide.

Try to send emails that contain "I would like to code..." and please don't
send the ones that contain "it would be nice if someone coded..."

:-)
