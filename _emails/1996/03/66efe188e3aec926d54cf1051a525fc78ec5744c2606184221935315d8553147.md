Yes. Apparently there's even a standard place on the export request forms
to check off "please resubmit without triple-DES support." If this is
something you want to be able to take across the border, you need to get
it from a non-US source.

You wouldn't be jailed, since as far as I know, it's perfectly legal for
you to use DES. It's just illegal for anyone in the US or Canada to give
it to you.

It's possible that some NAFTA working group has written regulations to
make Mexico answerable for ITAR violations, but I seriously doubt it.
