A far better site that is not being censored is:

Greg Raven is a serious Neo-Nazi wacko who took over the IHR by force. The
police were called in to break up the fight, and the Nazis spent some time
suing each other for control. See the Willis Carto/IHR FAQ for alt.revisionism.

The "censorship" page is full of events that never happened. Brian
acknowledges that the errors I pointed out are errors, but complains that he
"doesn't have time" to go back and correct them. He has had time, though, to
add more events that never happened. See the URL below [sic].

See also http://www.stormfront.org/, which has widely been reported to have
been "censored." It's not. That front page is just Don Black's idea of a
joke. See http://www.stormfront.org/stormfront/,
http://www2.stormfront.org/default.htm, and http://www3.stormfront.org/. The
Nazis are quite well-connected. IHR uses AOL because they *want* to be
censored so that they can play victim, and get more support from the
otherwise reasonable people here. Even Steve Case knows this, which is why,
uncharacteristically, he isn't booting them off.
