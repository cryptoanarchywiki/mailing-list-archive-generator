| Ok.  Sounds good, for user-maintained keys like PGP anyhow.
| More hierarchical keys, like X.509, could be maintained
| by a CA that also maintains the server... some people who
| could use encryption don't know, and don't want to know, enough

| enough to be able to support a CA maintaining user's certificates
| for them.  Note that this doesn't mean that the CA/key server
| would know the keys, i.e. this should not support GAK*.

	Having keys placed in a namespace defiend by a user does not
mean the user needs to make the key available, only that the key can
be found there.

	Nothing says we can't have key://keys.verisign.com/~ericm if
they issue keys in some space that maps into user names.

	Donald Eastlake is writing the spec for storing keys in
nameservers.  Its in the process of moving to draft standard; there
will probably be something about it after LA.  I think its:
