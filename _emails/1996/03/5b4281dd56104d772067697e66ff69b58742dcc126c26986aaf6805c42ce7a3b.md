As someone who was involved in the recent iKP / SEPP /STT / --> SET
event I would like to point out that it was the storage of CC numbers in
databases connected to the Internet which was the primary concern of
credit card companies. 

Sending credit card numbers across the internet in the clear was to an
extent a side issue. Clearly if the merchant was nopt going to be able
to store the number the number would have to not be received in
cleartext by the merchant.
