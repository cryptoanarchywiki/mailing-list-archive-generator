99% of US drug deaths are from legal drugs.

Alcohol's more like 100,000, as of 1990 figures, about 20% of US drug deaths;
this is just disease-related deaths, excluding drunk driving.
Tobacco was about 370K or 390K, roughly 75%.  
Prescription drugs were about 20,000, including suicides, and I don't
know if this included prescription opiates like morphine and codeine.
Caffeine, my personal favorite, is 5000-10000, though it's much harder
to estimate how much it really contributes to heart attack deaths.
Cocaine was about 2500, heroin 2000, PCP 700, the rest lower, total about 1%.
Marijuana was its usual 0 deaths.

As Tim says, it's far from crypto - but one of the main excuses for 
money-laundering laws is to track down pharmaceutical wholesalers' profits.
