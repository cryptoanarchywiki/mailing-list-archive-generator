Uh, I'm not sure what this sentence means.

When it can be directly applied to your opinion that the Bennis case has 
anything to do with remailers, sure.

[Whining about how a supreme court decision upholding the use of acid 
measurements including the weight of blotter paper as a guide to 
sentencing was really unfair deleted.]

Actually, the decision was in line with a long history of precident.  
That fact that you personally don't like the result has little to do with 
the legitimacy of the decision, or its fairness under law and the 
constitution.

Precisely.  This is called the seperation of powers.  It is the 
responsibility of the judicary to apply and intrepret the law, not make it.

Actually, if a decision is so damaging, congress is always free to change 
it.  The major whine you and your anonymous friend have [i.e. that the 
Supreme court refused to apply the change in sentencing measurement of 
weight for LSD convictions] is entirely out of place.  If you took the 
time to look at the retroactivity issue, you would know that it was not 
applied retroactively because congress did not indicate that it should 
have been, (which congress was quite free to do, and has done before).  
Retroactivity in relation to a change in law by the legislature is NOT 
within the ambit of the court.  Congress simply refused to apply the 
sentencing changes retroactively.  If the court had done so, it would be 
making law.  This is not the function of the court.

Further, what the hell does any of this have to do with your former 
moronic claim that the Bennis case impacted remailers?  The claim that 
this is a statuatory construction case is rather far fetched.  It's a 
basic seperation of powers case, and it was decided correctly.

> "It is the responsibility of the citizenry, not Congress, to 'change'

Unfortunately, subjecting the supreme court to the short term whims of 
political fad would be devestating.  Making supreme court justices into 
elected officials is about the stupidist thing I've ever heard.  I won't 
even go into the kind of decisions you might get if this horridly 
reckless idea were implemented.

I think you need to crawl back under the rock from whence you came.

Really you and your anonymous friend have said nothing.  You don't like a 
pair of supreme court decisions, the basic premises and reasonings of which 
you couldn't recite if someone held a gun to your head and insisted.

I suggest you try and break the ego-centric pre-school mentality you 
have.  An eternity with satan himself and all of his devilish 
instruments of torture would be a walk in the park compared to five 
minutes in a dictatorship under you and anonymous.

Like I said.  Pre-school.
