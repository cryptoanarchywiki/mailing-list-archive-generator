Why? After all, the first lot of information proved to be worthless
(in the literal sense of having no economic value, it being a hunk of
junk). I can hardly see how you can complain about the result -- I
mean, it isn't like your encryption system was worth anything in the
first place, so it was hardly lowered in value.

I find it amusing how slippery the snake oil you peddle is,
however. This morning you claimed that several "cypherpunks" had been
sent information on your system and claimed it was "unbreakable". As
soon as a couple of cypherpunks note that what they were sent was
garbage, you claim, and I quote:

Ah, yes. This morning, unbreakable. Tonight "we had some reservations
about".

Why don't you stop wasting everyone's time? You can probably have a
fine career selling penny stocks or something.
