I again point out that without artificial intelligence, filtering is
very difficult. I already filter, but at best this eliminates about
one third to one half of the noise. The rest would require that the
filters actually understand the messages, which they cannot.

Why have thousands of mailing lists and newsgroups on the internet if
everything belongs everywhere? Why not just have one big one and
"filter"?

The answer is obvious. It wouldn't work.

I see we are becoming contemptuous of those who actually write pay
attention to the nuts and bolts of cryptography, eh?

Tim, why don't you go off with Jim Bell and the rest and start a
mailing list devoted to nothing but random chit-chat?
