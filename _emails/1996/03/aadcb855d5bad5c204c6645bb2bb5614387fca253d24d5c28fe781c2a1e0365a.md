You should visit their web site at http://absolute.com for more
information as they can do what they say they can.  

A high level format does not change bad track assignments and neither
will fdisk so if you hide something in an assigned bad track
(cylinder or cluster or whatever it is called) nothing will see it. 
Now all you have to do is activiate the software in the bad track, I
don't know how that is done (trade secret??) but maybe someone has
figured out how to do it.

Calls to 1-800 numbers can not block caller-ID, call-blocking will
not stop the calling number from being passed to the appropriate
equipment setup at the receiving end. 

Maybe these people have developed the ultimate virus, you can't
detect it, you can't remove it, and you don't know it even exists.

I don't really know how well this software package works but your
comments had many errors.
