I don't think that you can avoid the speed problem.  The SecureDrive TSR
has to decrypt the data on the disk and this can be a slow procedure when
dealing with 100 megabytes.  You could speed up the backup procedure by
turning off compression.  I know that pkzip has this option, but I'm not
sure about any of the other programs you mention.
