   3-8-96. FT:  "Asean forum to fight Internet sleaze." 
 
      The Association of South-East Asian Nations agreed 
      yesterday to censor "negative elements" of the Internet. 
      Information ministers are concerned about "information 
      contamination" and agreed on the need for regulation and 
      to learn from each other's experience, particularly from 
      Singapore. 
 
   3-6-96. WSJ: "Singapore Unveils Sweeping Measures To 
   Control Words, Images on Internet." 
 
      Singapore said it will concentrate on individuals or 
      organizations putting content on the Internet and the 
      country's three access providers. Only public forums, or 
      electronic spaces where people can converse or create 
      displays visible to others who journey there, will fall 
      under the regulations. 
 
   3-8-96. TWP: "FBI Advertises for Tips On Spies From 
   Vietnam." 
 
      FBI officials said the advertisements were prompted by 
      an increase in activity by Vietnam's intelligence agents  
      impersonating relatives of Vietnamese Americans to sneak 
      into the country and steal high-technology secrets.
