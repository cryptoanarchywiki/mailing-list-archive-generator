     Sameer and Cory,
     
     Consider setting up some persistent html pages on cryptology, privacy, 
     cyphernomicon, cypherpunks list, and cypherpunks archives.  Include 
     these URL's as bookmarks with the delivered Netscape browser.  The 
     page on the cypherpunks list could have a subscribe (mail-to) button, 
     as well as some list nequitte, a product warning about list volume, 
     and an unsubscribe (mail-to) button.
     
     Martin G. Diehl
