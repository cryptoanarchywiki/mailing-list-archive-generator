Note that the spooks have carefully avoided a full bore court 
showdown.  They harassed Phil until the statute of limitations 
caught up with them, but never brought it to trial.  If we had
no further legislation, and the courts broke ITAR, we would
be home free.  No plausible legislation could give us that.
