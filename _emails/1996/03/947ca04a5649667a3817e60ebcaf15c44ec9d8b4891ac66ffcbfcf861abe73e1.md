Ever since I started publicizing my "Assassination Politics" idea, I've 
noticed that self-selected opponents of this idea frequently invent these 
hypothetical scenarios to try to criticize it.  Now, I can't deny that any 
given scenario can happen, but I respond that I don't believe that it 
would occur very frequently, and I usually give reasons why.  I don't 
normally get any kind of challenge to this:  They've shot their wad, so to 
speak.


>Proponents of such a scheme should stick a bit more to crypto...

Well, I agree, but keep in mind that the text you quoted above was 
apparently written by a critic, not a proponent.
