You _do_ have an odd way with words.  "entails" criminal charges?  Hey, they 
can charge ANYBODY with ANYTHING, but that doesn't mean that a crime has 
actually been committed.  Further, it isn't clear that anybody is obligated 
to respond to a subpoena without the possibility of a court challenge, and 
your fantasy about the cops showing up and trying to strongarm the ISP is 
laughable at best.

Who said anything about "destruction of material evidence"?  Refusing to 
hand over information until AFTER a court has properly responded to a 
challenge to a subpoena is old hat to newspapers, TV stations, and other 
media-organizations who are occasioinally served with a subpoena.  The ISP 
need merely say, I'm challenging this subpoena in court, go away 
motherfuckers!  ISP prepares a challenge, "CC's" ALL the affected 
individuals, (including the person whose information is desired!),  and the 
validity of the subpoena is tested.

>Please.

My feelings exactly.  Please stop acting like a government suck-up all the 
time.  Maybe you're paid to do it, but unless you're a plant, you're on your 
free time now.

Again, you blindly assume that the subpoena can't be challenged in court.  
It can be.

You keep inventing these phony scenarios, building up these straw men and 
knocking them down.  Clearly, your underlying argument is quite weak.  I 
said nothing about "destroying evidence."  In fact, the ISP could simply 
encrypt everything with the target's public key, and keep it.  That's not 
"destroying evidence," that's locking it away in such a way so that nobody 
except the target can unlock it.   Ideally, this would be done automatically 
every time a person calls his ISP, although the software to do this probably 
doesn't exist yet.  The result would be that whenever the target was NOT 
connected to the ISP, there would be no information on the ISP's system that 
could be decrypted by the ISP operator.

This would be one of those inventive future uses of encryption, well beyond 
plain vanilla PGP, which we must assure ourselves will be developed.  The 
kind of thing you dread, obviously.

If an ISP's system automatically encrypts all received message's with the 
destination's public key when received, and doesn't keep an unencrypted copy 
around, showing up at that ISP's location with a warrant will result in ZERO 
(ZIP, ZILCH, NEGATORI, etc) information that can be  delivered, unencrypted, 
to the cops.

No, an even better defense is to make it absolutely impossible, as a matter 
of business practice, to assist the police with any kind of an 
investigation.  Before you go off and shoot your mouth off about how evil 
and bad that is, you need to remember that regular destruction of records is 
an acceptable practice in any company today.  While courts will look askance 
at it when it does not appear to be a regular business practice (say, the 
company gets sued today and they have a mass shredding tomorrow) there is 
nothing wrong about regularly making past records unavailable by shredding, 
burning, erasing, or by any other method. 

Making those records SELECTIVELY unavailable by encrypting them with 
somebody else's public key and keeping them has probably never been tested 
in court, but if the business contracts this ISP regularly signs have this 
as a provision of doing business, the court can't squawk after the fact.  
After all, the ISP might have simply erased the files, keeping them from 
being accessed by ANYBODY, including their "owner."

Hey, you can FREQUENTLY "thwart the authorities."  If I have evidence of a 
crime in my house, the cops can't come in unless they have a warrant.  If I 
know they're coming, and can destroy it untraceably, I WIN!  See, that's how 
freedom works!  It's  nearly the exact opposite of "the government can do 
anything it wants, any time it wants, and anybody who frustrates them is a 
criminal!"

Naturally, you won't like this.

Yet another one of your multiple problems is that you have no imagination 
when it comes to "thwarting the authorities."  I do.  Don't try to tell me 
what can't be done, because I'll turn around and tell you how it CAN be 
done!  I just did.  The actual implementation waits for some slick coder to 
do it, but I give you 5 years, tops, before it's in regular usage.  And 
that's assuming they're all a bunch of lazy bastards.

A list which seems to be the current modus operandi of most levels of 
government in America, today.

In any case, I think it's fair to hold an ISP to his word and contract.  If 
the "normal" referee to such contracts (the court system) becomes biased 
because it begins to be an interested party to the enforcement of the 
contract terms, then bypassing that court system is unavoidable and is 
entirely appropriate.

You won't like this, either.

It's easy to kill, and hard to resurrect the dead.

Yes, I'd say you're "clearly erronious."  

If you can repeatedly describe, in nominally accurate terms, how abusive the 
government has become and NOT oppose its actions with every fiber in your 
being, then YOU have made yourself part of the problem.

That's not what I'm referring to.  Judges are mortal.  If they abuse the 
sense of propriety of the average indidivual, they SHOULD be removed, by 
legal methods if possible, by other methods if not. 

Remember that prosecutor who died in Boston a few months ago?  You know, the one who made the national news?  I'm still waiting to see how that one came out, but I suspect they will never be able to prove who did it, and may not even be able to find out.

Except that in a court room, the decision maker is PAID by a party to the 
case, the government.  That sounds like a classic conflict of interest to me.  What's the old rhyme,

"Treason doth not prosper, what is the reason?
Where treason does prosper, none dare call it treason."
