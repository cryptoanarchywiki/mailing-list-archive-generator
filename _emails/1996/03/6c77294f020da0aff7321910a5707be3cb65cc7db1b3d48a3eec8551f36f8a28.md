Your misunderstanding of how interceptions are done is dangerous to
what is otherwise a rational, intelligent argument.  

Indeed, there are ways to conduct a wiretap without a judge.  They require
dispensations from people like the Attorney General, for example.  And
this is certainly not a normal practice.

There are a lot of reasons to object to DT, but this is not one of them.
