Those of you who follow FIREWALLS may recall that I premote the use of
"minefields" on networks, machines that should never be accessed and will 
trigger an alarm/response on any access.

Some years ago I wrote a spec for cryptographic securing of notebooks/
E-Mail that included a "duress" capability: a "password" that, when 
entered would appear to be properly accepted but would report an error 
on retrieval. Optional was to be overwriting of any material whose access 
was attempted.

For some time people have been puzzled when I have said that good systems
protection will increase the risks to the *people* involved just as good
locks on cars led to carjacking.

					Warmly,
						Padgett
