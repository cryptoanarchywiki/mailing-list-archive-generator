OK.  *THAT* might be interpreted, wrongly, as self-censorship.  But words 
have a *precise* meaning, which unfortunately, I sometimes miss in 
the english language.

The opinion I wrote was in the *context* of the interaction of an artist with
a purchaser.  In that context, what govern the events is consensuality:
everybody acts *uncoerced* to his best advantage.


In the case you cite, the *context* is very different.

But still, I would not call it "self-censorship".  I do not have, on the top
of my head, any precise term for it, but maybe FUD, fear of physical violence,
survival tactics while harrassed by a thuggish assaulter, etc.,  would
apply...


I did not think twice, I thought about it several hundred times...

Your comment is *very* interesting.  It point out how peoples can so
easily blank out contextual information.

Forgive my bias but I personnally makes a big distinction between the 
volitional initiation of physical violence (or menace of) and other situations
where it is absent.

Regards!
