My understanding was that the parallel-port version of the Syquest drive
would also be bootable. That is, you would boot the driver off a floppy and
then the rest of the boot sequence would be handled by whatever was on the
Syquest drive. 
 
THis, I thought, would let you install something like linux and the various
other software to give you a very portable anon server, neatly containing a
separate OS and all the "incriminating evidence" while the regular hard
disk held nothing other than Windows and Doom. 
 
Is this not the case?
