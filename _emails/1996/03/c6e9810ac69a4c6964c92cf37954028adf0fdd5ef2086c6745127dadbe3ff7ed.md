The pernicious effects of censorship:  When you actually meet monsters,
and see that they do not have horns and a tail, you falsely imagine 
that they are not monsters.

You will read: "So and so went to site of the alleged extermination
centers, and he saw X, Y, and Z, and this shows there are holes in
the extermination story.

Simple lie.

Whenever I write about Cuba, leftists write:  "I went to Cuba, 
and I saw such and such so and so".  Well I went to Cuba, and 
I know that they lie barefaced, therefore I assume the same is
true of the flatly conflicting tales concerning the holocaust.

Those who defend totalitarianism, regardless of the brand name of 
totalitarianism, simply lie.  It is as uncomplicated as that.
