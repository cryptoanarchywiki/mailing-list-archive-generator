Back in the dark ages, IBM built an audio messaging system.  It was quite
popular in "cave of the winds" (IBM headquarters) because it allowed busy
executives to leave audio memos for each other without needing a secretary
to type them.  Since storage was limited, and old messages were purged from
the system it also had the effect that anti-trust discovery would have
nothing to discover.
