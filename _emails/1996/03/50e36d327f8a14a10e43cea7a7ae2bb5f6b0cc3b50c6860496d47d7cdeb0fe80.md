"For secure servers, VeriSign currently offers a 'high-assurance'
Class 3 Digital ID for electronic commerce servers. "  This is from
Verisign's home page.  They are saying that this class of certificate
is safe to do commerce with.

I would think that netscape would only make agreements with CAs that
accepted liability.  I would also think that Netscape would only be
liable if they were found to have put in a CA that they had reason to
believe was not taking due diligence to ensure that the key really
belonged to the company that claimed to own it.
