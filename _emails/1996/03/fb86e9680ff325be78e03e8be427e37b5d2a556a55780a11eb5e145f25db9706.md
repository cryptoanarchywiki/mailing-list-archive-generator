I heard they have many more people using their system than it can handle,
so the response time is really bad.

Also several people complained that they tried to cancel a netcom account
and netcom kept on billing their credit card.

(I'd never deal with an ISP who doesn't accept checks or money orders.
And I mean checks, not automatic withdrawals from a checking account.)

dhp.com has been recommended to me as an ISP that respects its users privacy.
