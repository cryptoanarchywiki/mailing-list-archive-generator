This is very debateable.  Generally, I've found that the government will 
always disappoint you, in the implementation of any legislation, "good" or 
"bad."  The "good" gets less good, the "bad" gets more bad.

I don't know about others, but _I_ haven't done that.  I've made some 
distinct criticisms that say NOTHING about the extent to which export 
controls are loosened.  (I leave that part of the issue alone because it is 
being addressed properly, unlike the matters I'm focussing on.)


BTW, it has been two days since my first comment to you, however, and you have
presumably seen a few more criticisms that I've heaped on a portion of the 
bill.  Your response (or lack of it) is particularly unexpected, because you 
ought to be interested in defending a  positive review of the bill.  
Sticking your head in the sand isn't a good tactic at this point.

If this is "a pretty bold step," then my question is, who "on our side" did 
they consult before they wrote this law?  If, as you state, "we need to 
educate them..." then the implication is that this bill simply popped out 
without any apparent "ordinary-crypto-user/small-crypto writer-seller" 
input, right?  In that case, we should ask "how [arguably] did they get what 
we wanted as well as they did?"   

On the other hand, if they DID get consultation from a number of "our" 
organizations, why didn't they fix the remaining problems?  


Here's a totally unsupported hypothesis for your consideration:  I speculate 
that they DID get some input from "our" side, via some confidential 
arrangement, by some of those same organizations that were falling all over 
themselves to praise most of the bill.  In other words, those organizations 
were subtly co-opted, although not nearly completely of course.  However, those 
organizations then felt like they had a "hand into" the structuring of this 
bill, and you know how blind to faults a proud parent can be!

Am I getting close to the truth here, Mr. Safdar?  Tell me, Mr. Safdar, did 
you consult a lawyer before you endorsed this bill?  Please share with us 
whatever legal opinions you received which induced you to speak positively 
about this bill.

Then let's take the position that this law CAN be changed!  In fact, let's 
insist on it.

With that limited statement I totally agree.

And the "mouthful" contains enough poison to kill our freedoms.  
Fortunately, the poison is easily identifiable, and is all in one spot, and 
should be removeable if we see it in time.

So why are these people trying to shove it down our throats?
