The DSS smart card has been reverse-engineered for at least six months now
and pirate devices are in the market. The encryption used on those systems
is good but it does not stand up to a well financed attack. In the European
version of the system, the encryption routines were using a hashing
function. The input packet also carried the authorisation data so it was
using this as an input packet. The DSS routine is probably based on a
similar hashing routine.

Using DES to encrypt the audio on the fly is an old technique and was used
in the VideoCipher II system. Most of the more recent systems use a PRNBSG
EXORed with the digital audio data stream.

The problem of piracy will still exist on digital systems. The DSS system is
a completely digital system and it too is hacked. Admittedly some of the
elements of security in the DSS are good, most can be rendered void by
hackers. The problem for DSS is that the smart card they used is not secure
enough. It was a Motorola 6805 type. What appears to be the pattern with the
hacks on more recent smart card systems is an inversion of the original
pattern on the simple analogue systems. The original pattern was that some
hobbyists would figure out how to hack the system and then the hack would be
commercialised. With the smart card hacks - the pattern is inverted so that
it becomes a trickle down pattern. The professional hackers reverse and
emulate the smart card and then the code is sometimes hacked from the
emulator card and then distributed among hobbyists.

The most dangerous thing in all this is that the smart cards that have been
hacked in Pay TV systems throughout the world are also used in other
applications. The expertise and the knowledge of reversing smart cards is
now more common in the Pay TV piracy business. There is always the
possibility that these skills could be applied elsewhere.
