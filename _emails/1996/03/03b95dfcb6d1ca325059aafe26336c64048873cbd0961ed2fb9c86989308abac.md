please, will people stop sending me responses like the above? do you
understand how the American legal system works? a person cannot
be prosecuted without evidence. evidence cannot be illegally obtained.
a person is not required to testify against oneself.  these are all
basic long-established cornerstones of our legal system.
...................................................................................


Please, please, when Nuri-logical makes a public post, will people stop copying him in their responses?  At least, not until you have read about the Clipper chip, the V-chip, key escrow, ITAR, the CDA, who those "four horsemen" are, etc., and understood how the American legal system works?

Personally, I am really amazed at all the times when people point out basic liberties to the NSA or the law enforcement agencies, and somebody says, well yes BUT so-and-so hypothetical situation might arise.

Why is there such deep fear about citizens? I'd say that some people there are high up on the list of creating a paranoia about life in the U.S. today.  I t is almost as if some people have a public "prosecute you" wish.
