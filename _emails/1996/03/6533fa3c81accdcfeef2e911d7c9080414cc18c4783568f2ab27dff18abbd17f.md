There's a problem with that. I've noticed several pages recently with 
hidden mailto: links that aren't marked as such. So you can be happily 
browsing away through a web proxy only to click on a link and have your 
real id mailed to the site's owners. As people have mentioned, this is 
even worse with Javascript.

Note to Netscape people: Is it possible to have an option that will *always*
pop up a mail window and request confirmation before mail is sent out? Or
disable mailto altogether? It would be a lot easier than binary editing 
the executable to remove all the mailto strings...

Or does it exist? I can't find it.
