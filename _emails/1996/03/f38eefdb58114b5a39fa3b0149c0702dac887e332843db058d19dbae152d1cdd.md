Some people have wondered why I am anonymous and attack me.
I am not ashamed of my views. I write this thread anonymous
as a form of protest.

The 10 PEOPLE on the LIST OF SHAME have their shields. The whole
government will come to their aid in helping them spread their
lie and is behind them.

I have an acount and post regularly under my real name. I am not
ashamed of my views. I am proud of them.

I write this anonyously as a form of protest because they have
there shield and we have our remailers. I WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY!
THEY MUST NOT BE ALOWED TO TAKE OUR SHIELD AWAY.

BOYCOTT THE SELLOUTS
AND
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
