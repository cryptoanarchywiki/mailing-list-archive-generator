Background

Information Warfare represents a global challenge that faces all late-industrial
and information age nation states.  It also represents the easiest and cheapest
way for less developed nation-states and religious or political movements to
anonymously and grieviously attack major nations and international corporations.

Not only are the definitions of InfoWar unclear, but they span many areas and
disciplines.  This conference will examine the European perspectives on all
three classes of Information Warfare while contributing some American lessons
learned, mistakes made and successes enjoyed.

Class One: Personal Privacy
Class Two: Industrial and Economic Spying and Warfare
Class Three: Global Conflict, Terrorism and the Military

As at all other Information Warfare Conferences, this special European
Conference encourages active audience participation, contribution and debate.
