With PGP at least, it should be possible to hand over the IDEA key required
to decrypt each message in question without having to hand over your
private key.  Since the court would have your public key, they could verify
that the IDEA key you gave them was indeed the correct key.

Of course if they are using the subpoena to intimidate you, then they will
insist on the private key.

N.B. The IBM voice system mentioned above (and the attribution should be to
me, and not Black Unicorn) did not use any crypto.
