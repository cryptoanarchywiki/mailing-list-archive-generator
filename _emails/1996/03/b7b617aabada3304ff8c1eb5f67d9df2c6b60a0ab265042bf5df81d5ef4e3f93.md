Win95 does alter the Master Boot Record on the drive.  This tends to screw
up previously installed boot managers.  Reinstalling lilo (or whatever boot
manager you use) usually does the trick.  (The MBR changes do not seem to be
a requirement.  I have no idea why they do it.  Maybe to make sure that you
use *ONLY* Mr. Bill's OS.)

I get around the problem by having removable drives.  (Each one with a
different OS.)  Avoids having to deal with the chance of messing up all of
my operating systems at once...
