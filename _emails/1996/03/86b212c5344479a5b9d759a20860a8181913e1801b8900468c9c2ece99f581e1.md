The one thing that disappoints me about the result of my presentation of 
this idea is that I haven't heard any intelligent arguments quantitatively 
arguing that things will be worse.  Other proponents simply agree that the 
system would be better; most of the opponents don't take the trouble to 
quantify their objections.

What's interesting is that you see this; yet there are a number of opponents 
who can't seem to realize that what THEY want (or, for that matter, what _I_ 
want) may be absolutely irrelevant to what is actually going to happen.

These are the kind of discussions I'd most want to have.  I understand, 
however, that anybody might hesitate a bit to appear to be actively 
encouraging such a system.  That's why I've decided my best function is to 
be the initiator of the idea, and the primary educator.  Somebody else will 
actually develop the system, probably without telling me anything.

Perhaps, but most (non-net-using) people are so unaware of encryption as to 
make this irrelevant, I think.

Well, there's not a great deal that we can do to prevent it.  Five years 
ago, I'm sure the then-users of the Internet were fearful of all the newbies 
to come; even today, we may subtly fear those to come.   In other words, 
once WE'RE on the lifeboat, we don't want anyone else to show up!

Have you forgotten what might happen to those same televangelists?

While I'd sure like to be able to design a system where only the "right" 
people die (by my own opinion), I'm under no illusion that this would be 
anything other than a dictatorship under "Jim Bell" or whoever happened to 
be in control.  I think I've done a fairly good job of designing 
(anticipating?) a system that will do a lot of good, hopefully without doing 
a lot of bad.

There may be nothing I can do about the negatives, unfortunately.
