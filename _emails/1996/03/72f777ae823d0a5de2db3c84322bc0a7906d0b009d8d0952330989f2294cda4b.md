I wonder if it's possible to _subvert_ Java. That is, have site "A" send
along some modifications to a Java class, so that when the user logs into
site "B" (which calls that class), Nasty Things Happen. What site "A" does
raises no alarm flags _until_ site "B" trips the trigger - making it look
like site "B" is the Bad Guy.

(WARNING! CDA Violation!) Hell, you might even be able to spread the
modifications around some, so that it's even less obvious where they were
done. Maybe even use the technique to modify Java itself, thus disabling
security controls.
