Note: I have changed the thread title from the meaningless "Signature"
(meaningless to this context) to something I think is more appropriate.
Someone recently wrote to me asking why I so often change thread names, as,
in his words, "it screws up the threading in my reader." Well, I think
accurately labelled articles are more important that having a reader place
an article in its "correct" position when the themes have changed so much.

I urge all of you to think about what your article says and what the most
accurate name is for it. By all means leave the name the same if you want,
or if the Hamming distance is not too great. But if the topic has changed
away from the name given by default, then _change_ the name to reflect the
topic at hand.

On to the actual article:

Besides these points, something missing from cellular automata-based crypto
schemes is this: invertibility with a different key than was used to
encrypt. That is, in any fractal or cellular automata-based schemes I have
seen, a generator iterates a data set, transforming it into something which
appears to have "no resemblance" to the original data set. The problem is
that there is no second key, the decryption key (or "private" key) which
reverses the process and recovers the original data set.

That is, it is certainly possible to get some "messy" output by running a
cellular automata (think: "the Game of Life" as an example) on an input. An
attacker would be hard-pressed to determine the starting pattern if given
the nth generation! So far, so good.

The problem is that the _recipient_ would also have a hard time determining
the starting pattern! And a more detailed wrinkle is this: at best, the
system would be a single-key or symmetric system, losing the advantages of
a public key system. At worst, the scrambled message could _never_ be
recovered, as no inverse can be found of the CA. (In CA research, finding a
starting pattern from some nth generation is known as the "Garden of Eden"
problem, for reasons I won't get into here. Clearly, some CAs have no
single inverse, as multiple inputs map into the same output--again, think
of "Life.")

Steven Wolfram had some speculations about using fractal or cellular
automata-based systems for a new kind of cipher. His paper is in one of his
books ("Theory and Application of Cellular Automata"), but it doesn't
really get beyond just speculating. And, I recall that someone proved
several years ago that Wolfram's CA-based encryption scheme was formally
equivalent to a linear congruential generator.

I think I included a few paragraphs on this topic in my Cyphernomicon.
