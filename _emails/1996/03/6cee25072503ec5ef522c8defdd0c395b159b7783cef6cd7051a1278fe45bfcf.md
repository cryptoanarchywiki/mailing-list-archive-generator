Hey Squatter!

Have you found the hidden "hot" spots and registered to win the Shaq/Pepsi
World's Slammin' Techno Dream Contest?  Deadline to enter is March 31st,
only a few days away.

Don't miss out on your chance to win a $25,000 Gateway computer shopping
spree and a trip to Orlando, Florida to meet Shaq and catch the Magic in
action.

All ya gotta do is find the hidden "hot" spots.  Seem impossible?  Well,
here are a couple of hints:


"Shaquille O'Neal is his name,
Movies and basketball are his game.
So cruise by La La Land or Adrenalin to give your luck a try,
And find the ball that Shaq has left behind."

"Twinkle, twinkle little star,
25 grand could go real far..."

Good luck!
