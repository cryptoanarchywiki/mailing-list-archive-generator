On the contrary, the government would have far _less_ ability to forfeit
the property of a remailer-operator for the activities of a non-owning abuser
than they do to seize Mrs. Bennis's car, because the misuser, Mr. Bennis,
was also its owner.

On the other hand, I'd say that a remailer used for assassination politics
is _far_ more likely to be seized, warranted, subpoenaed, and otherwise harassed
that one merely used for unencrypted dirty pictures or encrypted dirty money....
