	I can see your reasons for doing so. The discussion of how to use
ratings systems in ways not intended, so long as the government isn't able to
get in the way of doing so, is probably more interesting.

	I may check with a lawyer myself on this issue. I had known that
prior restraint, as in restraining something from being published at all, was
considered unconstitutional by all but the nut-case authoritarians. But I had
thought that the question of rating was still up in the air - the TV industry
seems to have decided not to fight the V-chip in court, for instance. Since
the government seems to have decided that it can remove "indecent" material,
as judged by them, from the purview of minors, it could argue that a mandated
rating system is the "least restrictive" way to do so - ignoring that others
can use it for further restrictions.

	Well, I and Senator Helms have differing views on what is "obscene"
and what isn't - and a court is more likely to go with his (prevailing
community norms and all that nonsense) in deciding whether to prosecute me.

	There's also the lawsuit issue. If somebody decides that I haven't
rated my words high enough to keep "indecent" material from their children,
they may sue - and "community norms" will be used to decide.

	I was discussing what was ethical for the proponents of rating systems
to do, not what they should be _allowed_ to do. In other words, I am in favor
of allowing anyone who wishes to create a rating system, just as I am in favor
of allowing anyone who wishes to talk a bunch of utter trash about Holocaust
Revisionism. But I wish to discourage people from doing either (or at least in
the first case from creating systems that can be misused in such an obvious
fashion).

	I use it as the anarcho-capitalists do who claim that taxation is
theft. It gets the attention. I am angered by modern trends in favor of
_either_ parental (parents deciding their kids shouldn't learn about evolution,
or about sex) or societal (curfews et al). I am also angered by cases like the
Joey Buttafuocco (sp?) one, in which he was convicted for having sex with a
(definitely willing) minor who was decided to be sufficiently competent to
be tried as an adult for committing murder. I had a set of decidedly
overprotective parents myself, and I can trace lots of psychological damage
from that. They did it out of love, but sometimes that just doesn't work.

	I tend to conclude that neither parents nor "society" should have any
more reign over their children than absolutely necessary. Parents have certain
rights over their children which derive from their responsibilities over those
children - i.e., to keep those children safe, get them educated so they can
have freedoms like speech and press, et al. If the parent can't clearly show
that the intervention into the child's life isn't necessary for that
responsibility to be fulfilled, then the parent shouldn't be able to do that
intervention any more than I should be able to claim that the CO2 being put
out by a factory is harming me, and should be stopped, without a lot of
evidence otherwise.

	I agree about the "mandatory" part; I simply want to make it an option
for that child - not an option for the parent.
