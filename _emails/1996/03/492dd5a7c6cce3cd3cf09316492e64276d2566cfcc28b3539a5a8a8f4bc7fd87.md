Looking for "good guys" in Washington is like Ronald Reagan looking 
for "moderates" in Iran.  On crypto, and on taxes, our interests 
and their their interests are completely opposed.  We should not 
care about, or take any interest in, the slight difference between 
the "moderate" and extremist members of the Senate and the House 
of Representatives.


The best bill we can ever hope to get out of Washington is no
bill at all.
