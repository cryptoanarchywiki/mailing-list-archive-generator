Ah, note that the magic key, 42, is not included. Coincidence, or stupidity?

Alan, there is not enough time in the universe to waste it on those who
will not learn even the basics. The "author," who I had understood to be a
friend of yours (though apparently a more distant relationship is
involved), is apparently developing something John Dee would have been
proud of.

Fortunately for the rest of us, cryptology has moved on in the last several
hundred years.

I again urge you not to waste your time on this. Or our time.

(Trust me, in five or six years, if your friend sticks to his current
course, he will announce to the world his "discovery" of the "virtual one
time pad" and will be preparing a public stock offering in Silicon
Snakeoiltronics.)


A few other minor points:

Last I checked, Tony Patti was still the editor. Not all things are on the
Web in serious ways, obviously. I had no problems finding copies in my
local university library (UC Santa Cruz), but it was several years ago that
I last checked (conventional cryptanalysis not being very germane and all).
Reed College might have copies.

Perhaps as a hobby, for those who find the NYT crosswords exciting. But of
little significance for modern cryptology, except as a cautionary tale.

have dropped over the edge of the earth this time... "the sorriest bunch

"the only reason to run for Congress these days is to suck the lobbyists'
