Burden of proof?  Sorry, I do not have to justify my views to anyone. 
 I am trying to have a reasonable discussion of this issue, thus, the 
"burden of proof" lies equal on each of us.

True, I am not a lawyer.  I would like to hear from one of the 
lawyers on the list for a more deffinitively.  Since you also admit 
you are not a lawyer, I do not accept your opinion as superior to 
mine.  I was pointing it out as something that I believed you had 
missed.  I find it hard to believe that anyone can further a felony 
when their is no felony.  In addition, this is VTW's interpretation 
based on the analysis that they have posted to their home page.  I 
would presume that they were using lawyers to analyze the bill.

Yes, this case was certainly a travesty.  The thing about it was that 
it violated the law.  Their actions took place in California, but 
they were tried in Tennessee.  This is a violation of U.S. law.  
Again, this is my non-professional opinion, but I have heard several 
professionals proclaim that the governments actions seriously 
violated its own laws.   If your point is that the government does 
not obey its own laws, then all I can say is that if that is how you 
feel then why oppose the bill?  Won't they end up doing what they 
want anyway?

I don't but this.  If I am a reporter if I receive an anonymous tip, 
a court could order me to tell who my source was, but I couldn't and 
they couldn't do anything about it unless they could prove that I 
knew who the source was.  If I knowingly aranged for the source not 
to reveal himself to me, could I them be charged with obstruction of 
justice or contempt of court?  Again it is my non-profesional 
opinion, but I really doubt this. Comment from a lawyer would be 
appreciated.

If I rent cars, someone might one day use a car rented from me in a 
robbery.  Does that make my an accessary?  NO.

If you think I am optimistic, you must think just about everyone is 
an easy dupe.  If I do not quite reach your level of paranoia, I 
apologize; I will try to get to where I distrust everyone like you. 
Or are you just plotting to make me paranoid?

Their is certainly A LOT of that with in our government, but to claim 
everyone in the government is a jack-booted thug is just too far over 
the top for me. (Yes, yes I realize you think this is niave.)

I don't want it removed, I think it is an important bone to through 
to those in the middle.  I would like the phrasing tightened up so 
that it could only be used against those that deserve it.

I was not proposing that exact language, I am not a lawyer and don't 
imagine I could come up with the bullet-proof wording that is 
required.

I am not aware of the vial case; I certainly would find such a thing 
interesting to read.  If this was what happened, and laws exist that 
allow this, then we ought to repeal those laws, but I don't see the 
baring that has on this case; I have already said that they should 
narrow the language so that it will not be used to the ridiculous 
extream.

I am not talking about reality; I am talking about what they can tell 
the voters if they are beat up over passing such a bill.  You seem to 
over rate the average voters grasp of the issues.  It doesn't matter 
that the bill really creates or diminishes crime, it is how the 
voters can be made to perceive it.

If that is true, than you are left with those that are the oppressed 
and the jack-booted thugs.  I do not believe that the only motivation 
of those that are opposed to strong encryption is to oppress me.  
Many are trying to do what they think is right, this provision is 
their to give those that are tetering between the two options an easy 
way to move to our side.

Good premise, now if you could sell that premise to everyone in 
Congress than your right this provision is useless.  Unfortunately, I 
don't think you will have much luck with this.

You talk about my being naive, this takes the cake.  Do you really 
believe that any pro-crypto bill could make it through Congress with 
out some sort of anti-crime clause?
