The Syquest EZ drive (130MB twice as fast as the ZIP, a little cheaper
too--around $200 for an internal drive and cartridge, with additional carts
around $20, and a 1 GB version available for $500, + $100 / additional
cartridge) comes in IDE, SCSI, and parallel flavors.  You can get an internal
IDE drive and DOS doesn't know or care that you can replace the cartridge.
 You can DoubleSpace the drive, (I have personally done this) so you should
be able to SecureDrive it too.  It is a full fledged IDE (or SCSI) drive.
