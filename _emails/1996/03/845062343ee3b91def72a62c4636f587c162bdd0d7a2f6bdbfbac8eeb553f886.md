The pizza guy was a thug, but twice as many third-strikers got
their third strike for marijuana as for all violent crimes combined.
I assume most of these had large quantities, possibly intended for sale,
and a number of them had real crimes as their previous felonies
rather than Prohibition-related offenses.  But you can get legally
serious quantities of marijuana by just growing a couple of plants.

>Perhaps the prosecutors are exercising prosecutorial discretion?

Not much - Government Radio said tonight that they're not allowed to
plea-bargain third strike felonies down to misdemeanors.  The LA public
defender's office is absolutely swamped, partly because third-strike
cases are supposed to get diligent support, and partly because they
have to go to trial rather than plea-bargaining a guilty, which is less work.
The county jails are also having serious crowding problems, because
prospective third-strikers are being kept in them pending trial
to avoid risk of flight, so non-third-strike jailees are getting out
early (especially drug violators.)

And the guys who just got busted for having fertilizer, diesel oil,
and drugs on their farm had a whole three ounces of marijuana and
personal-use quantities of crank.  Maybe they were planning to blow up
buildings rather than stumps; but the Feds are trying to paint them
as max evil just to build up their case.
