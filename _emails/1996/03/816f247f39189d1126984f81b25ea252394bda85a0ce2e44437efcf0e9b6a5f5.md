I don't agree that this is the only way to accomplish the problem I proposed.
I gave a scheme that is not equivalent to the one you state. you seem
not to address my actual technical description, although I admit it requires
a bit of inference on the part of the reader.

in the scheme I proposed, P1 and P2 are the two keys. an XOR or OTP
system has nothing to do with what I described.

one problem you do remind me of is that P1 and P2 are going to be
hard to "remember". of course the way PGP handles this is a pass
phrase that unlocks the encrypted key using the IDEA cipher. another
interesting approach would be to use a hash of the passphrase as
a random seed in the process to get the prime number. in other words,
the passphrase is the seed to the algorithm that hunts for the prime
number starting at some random location, and if fed the same seed
(the hash of the passphase) it will again find the same prime number....

I believe you have misunderstood my description. I gave a feasible system.
I don't know precisely what you mean by "multiple RSA keys". my system
did not have any aspect of public key crypto to it. it is a single
key cipher.
