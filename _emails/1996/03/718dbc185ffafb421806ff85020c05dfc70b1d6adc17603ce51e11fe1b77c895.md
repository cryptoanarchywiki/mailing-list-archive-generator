Hey!, if I lived on a farm I would no doubt possess similar amounts
of fertilizer and diesel.  I would also possess a few dozen assault
rifles if I could afford to (not that I'm a gun nut [I do happen to
enjoy shooting, and would doubtless own a few if I lived on a farm]
but would have "stocked up" before Klintons assault rifle bill.)
I also possess weapons manuals (ranging from bullwhips to blowguns
to 66mm anti tank weapons) and what you would call patriot literature
(ranging from books on Jefferson, on the civil war ("The South was
Right"), to The Turner Diaries.)  I am also an ocaissional drug user,
so you may find varying amounts of coke/crack, meth, horse, LSD, peyote,
and ecstasy in my abode.  In addition to this you would find books on
lockpicking, hacking, drug manuafacture, holocaust revisionism,
credit card fraud, false ID, smuggling, gun-running and tax evasion.
You would also find some very violent movies in my collection.

But, despite all of these circumstances, I assure you that I have not
(and would, ney, could not) commit any non-victimless crime.  I am an
out and out pacifist Libertarian.

I think this is what I call circumstancial evidence.
