Since someone other than Jim Bell and THE LIST OF SHAME author thought I
was being serious, I thought it wise to respond.

The notion that a measure of criticism from a known enemy, Dorothy
Denning, corrects the many problems with Leahy's legislation is absurd.

As a case in point, remember that Rush Limbaugh, Catharine MacKinnon,
and the radical religious right group American Family Association
criticized the CDA. That does not make the CDA worth passing.

(Of course Rush likes dirtysexycybertalk so he can pick up chicks
online, and the AFA wanted not less, but _more_ liability for ISPs, but
I trust my point is clear.)

Speaking of the CDA, I'll be in Philadelphia tomorrow and Friday for the
hearing. Any other cypherpunks planning to attend?
