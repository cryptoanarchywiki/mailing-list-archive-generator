  looking down his nose,
Senator Exon banned it
  Haiku's not a crime

  Rights groups lobbying
politicians waffl"ing
  Cypherpunks write code

  At First Virtual
tense hot alien in barn
  encrypts no message

  Later releases
in some communications
  there are signatures

  digicash tokens
no one knows what you're buying
  follow the money

  Senator Exon!
Imminent Death of the Net!
  GIFs at eleven!

  what they cannot read
they don't want to let you say
  you must encrypt it

  Crypto power tools
cannot be exported yet?
  how can they stop them?

  Freeh is watching you
Big Brother is watching you
  NSA listens

  #ifdef crypto
you cannot export this code
  #endif crypto

  if code is outlawed
bhgynjf jvyy unir cevinpl
  talking to their friends

  Beating a dead horse
idle thoughts typed on a train
  need more ideas

Senator Exon
And the horse he rode in on
******* indecent
