To all that keep telling me to use Applied Cryptography -- I have the book
already (an autographed copy ;-)

What I am seeking is more than what is in the book:

  * are there are any links on the web to SEAL?
  * is IBM actively marketing it?
  * what precisely is patent?
  * for how long?
  * has anyone currently licensed it?
  * has anyone tried attacking the algorithm?
  * should we be (the community) be looking at SEAL
    for standards (say as an alternative to RC4?)?
  * is there something better then SEAL available?
