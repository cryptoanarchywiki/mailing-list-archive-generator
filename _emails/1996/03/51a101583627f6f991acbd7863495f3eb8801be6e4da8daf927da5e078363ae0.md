I recently installed an IDE version of the Syquest EZ 135 hard drive for a
client.  Since it is a fully functional hard drive, it is bootable, unlike
the parallel port model.  The biggest advantage to this type of drive is that
the cartridge (and any potentially incriminating data) can be quickly removed
and destroyed (burn it, smash it with a large heavy object, insert it into a
bulk eraser) or taken to a secure location for storage.  Also, this type of
drive provides an excellent place to put swap files, which have an annoying
tendency to pick up sensitive data.  That is less of a problem if you can
remove the cartridge and store it in a secure location when not processing
sensitive data.
