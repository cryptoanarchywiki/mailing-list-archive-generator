IMHO, Congress *will* outlaw non-GAK strong crypto. It is only a matter of time.

It is a widespread myth that wiretaps require warrants. Court ordered
warrants are not required for a wiretap. They have not been required since
the Digital Telephony Bill passed. That the net, the media, and even
attorneys are so blissfully unaware of this, even years after the provision
doing away with requiring warrants became law, is one of the finest
examples of cognitive dissonance you are ever likely to find. It is too
disturbing to believe it, so the mind ignores the facts.

Excerpt from the Digital Telephony Bill

quote
SEC. 103. ASSISTANCE CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS.
(a) Capability Requirements: [...] a telecommunications carrier shall
ensure that its equipment, facilities, or services, that provide a customer
or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct
communications are capable of--

(1) expeditiously isolating and enabling the government, pursuant to a
court order or other form of authorization, to intercept, [...] all wire
and electronic communications [...].
end quote

*Other forms of authorization*, other than a court ordered warrant that is,
are explicitly allowed. Nowhere in the bill, or anywhere else AFIK, is
stated what form these other forms of authorization can take. No limits
whatsoever as to what the government can do.

"My supervisor approved it" may well suffice.
