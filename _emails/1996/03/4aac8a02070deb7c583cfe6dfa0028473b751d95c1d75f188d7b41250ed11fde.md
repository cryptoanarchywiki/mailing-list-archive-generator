Not if I am allowed geometry. I believe such situations are a test of
lateral thinking more than any fundamental insite into nature.

What are you defining as random? The definition I use in practice is basicly
that if I am given 100% intelligence on a stream of numbers the odds of my
succesfully choosing the next number is never higher than chance.

All data is random (by definition) until the pattern(s) can be discerned.
In this context pseudo-random has a definite meaning, namely that it takes a
long time to amass enough information about the data stream to break the
chance boundary. The question quickly becomes, how do you test various
sequences against one another for robustness? It seems to me that it has to
be done statisticaly.

One aspect of this is what I call the 'ghost' pattern. In short, in the
process of analyzing some random data a pattern is found. Is it possible
that there could be more than one pattern (ie interpretation) of the data?
Is it possible for a data stream to contain two (or more) messages
coherently? If a message does contain two or more coherent messages, how
does this affect the size of the data? Can this occur only on messages above
a certain size?
