IANACS (I am not a Constitutional scholar), but it is clear that the
Constitution, being a relatively short document, is a _framework_, a kind
of "generator," for establishing additional legislation. This is, obviously
enough, why there is _legislative branch_, after all.

Jim's argument (?) could be turned in all sorts of ways: "Your Honor, there
is nothing I can find in the Constitution that says I can't drive on the
left side of the road at 125 miles per hour." Indeed, there is nothing
laying out detailed traffic laws. And so on.

That the Fifth Amendment attempts to make it clear that a defendant shall
not be compelled to give testimony which may tend toincriminate himself
(lotsa gotchas, as expected) clearly--to me if not to Jim Bell--implies
that a "legal system" involving testimony, search warrants, subpoenas,
juries, verdicts, appeals, etc., is implied by various parts of the
Constitution.

(I could search one of the many online copies of the Big C for details, but
I'm sure you all, except perhaps Jim, get it.)

I'm no apologist for Big Government, of course, so I think we have vastly
too many laws in the U.S. But I don't think naive arguments saying that a
court cannot call witnesses by due process because the Constitution does
not specifically have a clause saying this is the case is going to be very
helpful or persuasive.
