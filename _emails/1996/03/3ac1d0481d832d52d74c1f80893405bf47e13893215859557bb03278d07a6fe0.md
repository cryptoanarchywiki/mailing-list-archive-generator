Spry Mosaic really does support SHTTP - you can use it to connect to the
SHTTP test pages at Terisa and Commercenet without difficulty, once you've
doped out how to generate and get signed a low-assurance RSA persona
certificate.

I just performed an altavista search for references to "shttp://" (the SHTTP
prefix) and "https://" (the SSL prefix). The results were 1,000 SHTTP
hits, and 20,000 SSL hits.

SHTTP may be technicly superior to SSL level 2.0, but as a commercial
software developer, I know on which side my bread is buttered.
