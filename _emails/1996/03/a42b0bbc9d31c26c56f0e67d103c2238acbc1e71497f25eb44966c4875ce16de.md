Let's stick one thread this time. I lost track when the Subject header
was changed. Twice! :-)

The original definition of the problem:

>>Bob must find out whether Alice has declared (commited) her interest
>>in him, if and only if he has declared (commited) his interest in her.
>>Before he does so, he can at most know that a girl is interested in
>>him. Another description: Bob and Alice can have a date if they both
>>commit to each other. If only one commits, nobody will ever find out
>>about it.

You got me confused. Does this thing exist, or you would like it to
exist? :-)

Correct. I believe my hash_k is equivalent to your **t (which I thought
as well, but preferred to use hash_k in my original description). Hence,
my "mediated off-line" protocol can also be written as:

- Bob, who likes Alice, sends [g**ab, pseudo(B)] to Trend who posts
  [g**abt, pseudo(B)]. Alice learns nothing at this point.
- If she ever decides she likes Bob, she sends [g**ab, pseudo(A)] to
  Trend, who posts [g**abt, pseudo(A)].

So Bob and Alice notice
g**abt, pseudo(B) and
g**abt, pseudo(A)
being posted so they know they have a match.

Somebody who knows t can only find out who is interested in them.
Nothing more.

T could possibly be replaced by n T(i)'s each of whom has a secret
key t(i). But this is another thread.

Assuming we have a fair AND protocol, Alice cannot initiate it with
Bob, because this would demontrate her interest. Solutions:

1) You can force all possible pairs to execute the protocol, as you
said, but is not very practical.

2) Alice could initiate the protocol even if she is not interested,
in order to "hide" the cases when she is genuinely interested. Not
very practical, either.

3) My proposal (protocol 3 in my previous posting) is that Alice
approaches Bob anonymously. But they can't execute the AND gate,
because Bob doesn't know who she talks to. What they compare is:
Alice's number: g**ab and Bob's number: g**bx where x is the
girl he likes.

Thanks, I will have a look. This will only work if there is a law
forcing newly met pairs of people to enter the protocol, as in
(1) above, right?
