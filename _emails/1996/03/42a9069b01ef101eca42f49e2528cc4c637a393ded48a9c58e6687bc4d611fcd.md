Malaysia Is Against Curbs On Internet Debate

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia - Censoring Internet access will not solve
   concerns over privacy and individual freedom in cyberspace, Malaysia's
   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said.
   
   &quot;Censoring the Internet is not the solution. Simply closing our
   doors will not only hurt us but push us back in the race for growth
   and prosperity,&quot; he said in a speech at the launching of the
   Internet World '96 conference
   (http:/www.asiaconnect.com.my/asia-internet/)
   
   Countries concerned with such issues should instead utilize the
   Internet to reinforce social responsibility, he added. &quot;Let us
   not forget that an informed citizenry is also a responsible
   citizenry,&quot; Anwar said.
