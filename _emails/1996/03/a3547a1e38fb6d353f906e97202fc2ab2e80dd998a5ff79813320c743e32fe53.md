	"If someone's hacked our systems, we'd certainly like to know about
	it, although it's very doubtful; more likely, this just someone
	trying to make you nervous" - Netcom admin, 2600, Summer 1994

	"Recent reports indicate that Netcom's credit file, stored online
	and containing information on all their customers, has been
	compromised" - 2600 Magazine, Autumn 1994

Netcom claim Mitnick broke in during xmas 94, when the reality is that every
half decent hacker had already been there.  Netcom are an INTERNET PROVIDER!!!
You would expect them to know a thing or two about security.

But then again, even security samurais have problems setting up firewalls :-)
