One problem that arise in all of the discussion around this theme 
is that peoples have very different ideas of the terms "self-
interest" and "selfishness".  The collectivists and mystics have 
made us accept the basic premise that selfishness means "acting
in a way harmfull to others".  They just trained us to blank out
the fact that, as rational animals who love life, our best inte-
rest might very well coincide with the one of our neighboor.

Man, after being a rational animal is also a social animal.

There is plenty of crypto relevency in this discussion and it lies
in the basic view of Man of the individuals in such discussion.

Is Man an intrinsical blood thirsty beast that either kills or cry
or is Man a rational animal that can enjoy life in a peaceful and
constructive and exciting way?

The one who have the first opinion wants more govt, more laws and 
GKE.  The others wants freedom.
