Not that anyone actually reads Mac magazines anymore, but back page of the
May 1996 issue of MacWorld (they don't procrastinate) bears an article
titled "Civil Rights Activists 'Say, Sniff This!': encryption is one
solution to net censorship," wherein Jim Warren, PGP, and other cool
things are presented in an unambiguously good light.

"On February 8th, President Clinton lifted his pen to sign the scabrous
Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996.... The law is just one example of
how our personal freedoms are fast eroding as digital technologies make it
feasible to monitor electronic communications.... The decision to encrypt
personal communication within this country is a political act that we
still have the luxury to practice today. It is already illegal in many
countries to use encryption for any reason without a license from the
government."

It should appear on www.macworld.com in about a month.
