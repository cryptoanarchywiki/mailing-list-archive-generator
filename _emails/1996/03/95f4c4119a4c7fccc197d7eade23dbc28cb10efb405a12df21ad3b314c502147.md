I seem to remember some sales named daemon stating that if anyone could break their system, the prize would be the company.  I imagine that the continuing rants from IPG are a means of devaluing the company beyond it's already measly worth, thus making the company unworth claiming.  It's obvious that the system has been trivially broken after a day and a half of being semi-published.

Is there any other point to this?

I could as easily generate an OTP pulling pages at random from the New England Journal Of Medicine or the Microsoft Visual C++ Programmer's Guide and XORing the text with my plaintext...

But that still leaves me in the cipher.obscurity = cipher.security realm, doesn't it?  Think we could sell it???  Of course, as long as it was someone else choosing the pages, I could trust it, right?  (Damn, which smiley is it for sarcasm?)
