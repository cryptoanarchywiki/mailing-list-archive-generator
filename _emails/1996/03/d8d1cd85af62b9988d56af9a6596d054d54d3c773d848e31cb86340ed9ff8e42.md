The SCSI version of the ZIP drive is a "fully fledged" SCSI drive. I 
use one on a Sun workstation without any special software/drivers, 
and secure the ZIP disks with CFS. It isn't terribly fast, but one 
hardly notices when one is dealing with the overhead of encrypting 
and decrypting the data anyway.
