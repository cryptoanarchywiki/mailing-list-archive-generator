I realize that this may appear to be a rather disrespectful tactic, but have 
you considered reminding the judge that if you are not allowed to profit by 
exporting encryption that the government doesn't want to see exported, 
you'll just have to make money in some other way, and this may lead you to 
talk to Jim Bell about implementing a program using encryption that doesn't 
_need_ to be exported...legally anyway.
