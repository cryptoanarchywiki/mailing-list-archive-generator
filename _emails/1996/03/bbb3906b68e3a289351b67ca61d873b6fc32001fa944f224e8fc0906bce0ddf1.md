	Either complete removal _or_ replacement with something clearly stating
the preferable interpretation (only for cryptography knowingly used by a person
committing a felony to conceal the commission of that felony). The latter,
while not as good as the former (why should there be additional charges for
using cryptography for concealment of a felony?), is acceptable with the other
portions of the bill counterweighing it.
