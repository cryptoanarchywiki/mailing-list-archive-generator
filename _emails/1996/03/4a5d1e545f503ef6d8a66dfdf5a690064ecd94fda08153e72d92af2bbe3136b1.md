Well, I do not agree with that statement.  Even if most individuals
are not acting on rational basis, it does not mean that Man is not 
a rational animal.  Man exercise thought and reason in a volitional
manner.  Wether he decides or not to do it is another thing.

So  many peoples *actively* avoid thinking and yet, it is the only
way they could survive if it were not of others...  In a sense,
they are free-riders.  To think and use reason requires efforts.
I guess that they just do not like exercising...
