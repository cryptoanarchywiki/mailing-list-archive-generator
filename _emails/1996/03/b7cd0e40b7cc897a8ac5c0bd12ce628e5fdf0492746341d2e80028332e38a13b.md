: The foreigner isn't a US person, so he doesn't violate the

: that it's providing encryption software to the foreigner,
: it may be liable, but without scienter it's tough to have guilt.
: Probably the foreigner should not keep encryption software on
: University or ISP machines - floppy disks should do just fine :-)

If the foreigner doesn't have a green card he is a foreign person and
allowing himself to read his own code would be disclosing that code to
a foreign person and that is a felony unless he first gets a license
which he can't get because he is a foreign person or a favorable
commodity jurisdiction determination which he can't get without first
reading his code and sending a copy of it to the Office of Defense
Trade Controls.
