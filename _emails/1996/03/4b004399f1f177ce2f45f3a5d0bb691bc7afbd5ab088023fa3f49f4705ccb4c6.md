What's your definition of "calmly."  I'm as "calm" as you can imagine. I 
simply have not a shred of mercy in me for people who can't accept reality.

Fortunately for me, Tim, and unfortunately for you, a friend of mine visited 
me last night, an ex-cop who is now a cabbie (he left the force due to an 
accident, slipping on glare ice chasing a "perp", which caused an inoperable 
back injury).  Being a cabbie (in the same town he was a cop), and very 
familiar with the "drug" and "prostitute" sections of town, I asked him 
whether or not he was aware of a hotel or motel ever being siezed by the 
govt. for "tolerating" drugs and/or prostitution.

His reply was that as we speak, he knows exactly where a motel has been 
closed, locked up, and BARRICADED with _city_ signs and POLICE TAPE (you 
know the kind, "Police line:  Do not cross.").  We're not talking of a 
bankrupty, or a voluntary shutdown, either.  His understanding was that this 
was on the news a while back.  Would you like the name and address?  I 
didn't ask him for it, but I'm sure he'll be driving by it again 
within the next week or so.

I accept your anticipated apology, Tim.
