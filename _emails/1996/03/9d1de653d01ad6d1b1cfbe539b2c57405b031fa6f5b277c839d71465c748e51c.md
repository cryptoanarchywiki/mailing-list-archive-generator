Politics make it C2.  The DoD mandated, years ago, that all their OSs had 
to go to the C2 level of trust.  Further, they had also mandated POSIX 
compliance in just about every procurement that they had to publish in CBD.

Well, they then proceeded to ignore their own policy and they bought MS 
DOS all over the damn place because everyone wanted the stuff just like 
they have at home.  You can't play DOOM on SCO UNIX, ya know...

So, in order to not look like a bunch of incoherent IRM loosers, they 
effectively forced the C2 and POSIX compliance stickers onto Windows NT 
even though everyone (including some nameless NCSC personnel with whom 
I've spoken) clearly state that C2/POSIX and MS Windows NT is an 
oxymoron.  Now everyone can claim to be running C2 and POSIX systems, 
even though, by admission of MS, you can't have NT configured for both at 
the same time.

Duhhhhhh...
