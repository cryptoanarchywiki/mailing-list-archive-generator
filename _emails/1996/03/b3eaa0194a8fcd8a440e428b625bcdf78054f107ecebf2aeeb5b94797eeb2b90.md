The newest Communications of the ACM (March 90) is entitled "How to Use Key
Escrow."  I haven't read it yet, but on a quick glance, I don't see some of
the  newer schemes I've heard of, but there is an article "taxonomy of key
escrow encryption systems" by Denning and  Branstad -- Which does briefly
mention of the Lotus scheme and some of the other published schemes that I
was thinking of.
