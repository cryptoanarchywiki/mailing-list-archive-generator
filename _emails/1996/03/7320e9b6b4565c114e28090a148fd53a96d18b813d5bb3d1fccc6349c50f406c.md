Just because someone floats their idea does not mean it is the "list
consensus"! That "raindrops falling on my plate" idea was something I
deleted as soon as I saw that it wasn't a joke with a nice punchline. (Not
all flaky ideas get rebutted...though, as a matter of fact, I did see
several quick rebuttals of the raindrop idea as being impractical, too low
a data rate, etc.)

Johnson noise in semiconductors and alpha particle noise have indeed been
discussed _many_ times. Check the archives, or my Cyphernomicon FAQ.
