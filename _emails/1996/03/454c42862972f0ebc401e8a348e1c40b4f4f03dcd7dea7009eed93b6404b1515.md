I mean illegal in the sense that your true purpose is to decieve law 
enforcement. (Yes, it'll also fake out anyone who bribes the escrow 
agent for your keys, though....)

Of course that depends how you give your key to an escrow agent. If 
it's already escrowed when you buy a phone, for instance...

It's part of warrants.  Nobody likes having the cops search their 
apartments either.   (I'd say a warrant is better than none, but 
judges are generally all too willing to grant a warrant, and the bill 
allows for "good faith" when no warrant is used anyway...)
