Interesting that Bob Dole is supporting it!
It's certainly not a perfect bill, and will presumably be less perfect
by the time it's passed.  But it's a nice alternative to Clinton, who
was happy to buy in to the previous Administration's anti-crypto efforts.


(I'll presumably be voting for Harry Browne or some other Libertarian,
unless I get fed up and vote for Frank Zappa or Hugh Romney; the Democrats
can look me up some year if they decide to run a genuine liberal :-)
