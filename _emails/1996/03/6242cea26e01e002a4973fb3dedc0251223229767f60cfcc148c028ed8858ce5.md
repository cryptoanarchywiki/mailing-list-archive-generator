What this demonstrates, regardless of the legitimacy of the claim, is the 
need for a web of trust that does more than estlablish the link between 
key and user, but one that distributes reputation capital.

The ability to assign reputation to remailers via digital signature is 
going to be of increasing importance, as is the use of larger keys by 
remail-operators.

Are there any grassroots projects on the table to address the former problem?
