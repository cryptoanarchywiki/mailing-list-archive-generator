This will be my last comment on this thread.  Mr. Bell is beginning to 
lapse into the "yadda yadda yadda" phase.  Constructive progress becomes 
nil at this point typically.

My judgment is not important.  What I have seen courts do is.

I never claimed anything so broad.  I pointed out that the examples you 
gave (tipping off the offender that he was being investigated, creating 
provisions to destroy or otherwise make unavailable evidence material to 
a criminal or civil investigation), were going to have to confront these 
problems.

Mostly because there is no distinct line.  You make your argument to the 
judge, he makes his ruling based on his perceptions and bias.  Sometimes 
you win, sometimes you lose.  When "offshore holding agent" or "trustee" 
is mentioned in the context of "unavailable" evidence, judges are not 
very patient.  Of course, your only response to this is "so kill them."  
Unfortunately, in the absence of your system, that's not much of an option.

No, that's not the question.  This question you just invented.  The 
question was, and specifically in reference to your "rosebud" tip-off 
scheme, can an escrow agent warn the principal of an impending 
investigation with the intent of facilitating the destruction or 
diversion of material evidence.

Of course, having this scheme debunked forced you to alter the facts, yet 
again, to favor you.

Again, you have to convince the judge of all this, and even if it is 
true, he doesn't have to buy it, can still impose fines, and can still 
jail the third party until he is convinced he/she is either telling the 
truth, or is very determined no to release the information at any cost to 
self.

Even if you can show that the third party is faultless, the principal is 
probably going to suffer the same fate.

The only way to do anyhting about the "current problems" in society is to 
kill and threaten?  Move to East Turkey.

Considering it combines the tyranny of the majority with the tyrrany of 
the minority and provides both with sovereign powers to sentence 
individuals to death arbitrarily....

I'll leave the rest to the reader.

Pay me my hourly rate and I will be happy to copy-edit everything I post.

For legal work involving international transactions or compulsary 
jurisdiction issues that tends to run $200-$300/hr.

I admit that ways that I don't like may work.  Your's wont.

Encouraging selective murder and mob justice is, in my view, in the second 
field.

You know, if Mr. Bell turned out to be L.D., he'd be violating our 
settlement agreement.
