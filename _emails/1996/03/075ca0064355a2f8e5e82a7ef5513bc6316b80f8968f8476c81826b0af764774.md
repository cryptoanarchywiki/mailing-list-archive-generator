Careful here.  Note exactly what the bill says:

wire and electronic communications necessary to provide for
public safety and national security should also be preserved;

SHOULD ALSO be preserved.

Typically this means that it's not going to be funded by this bill, and 
that this is just a bit of extra hint as to legislative intent.

I will grant you that it's not a nice bit, but it could easily have said 
"WILL be preserved."

Note this clause also does not assign the authority to any agency, or 
suggest how it might be accomplished.  It's a good indicator of where 
things are going, but in itself, it implements nothing.

(Disclaimer: I haven't read the entire bill yet).
