As far as I understand, the problem boils down to this:

   Nym users want to have an identity (belief of other users that
   a set of articles originating from many anonymous addresses were in
   fact written by one person). At the same time, we want to prevent
   users who do not have a permanent return address from using
   addresses of other persons.

One of the problems with allowing users to specify return addresses in
the letters is a possibility of forgery: what if
Mallory@evil-services.com posts a MAKE MONEY FAST message, and specifies
that her "From: " address should be Popugaev@get_high.edu? Such posting
could get Mr. Popugaev in trouble.

Maybe the following rewriting rule may be a good compromise between
functionality and security, for PGP signed messages:

1. Original "From: " address is rewritten as "X-Origin" or some such.

2. "From:" address is always set to the main user ID of the PGP key that
was in the signature.

3. For "Reply-To: " we use "Reply-To: ", if it is present, then we try
"From: ", and if "From: " is not present, "Reply-To: " is not set.

4. If "Subject: ", "Date: ", "Message-ID: ", or "Newsgroups: " is
present on the block of pseudo-headers starting with the first line of
the text, use them instead of trusting the headers of an email.

This way, we achieve the following results: 

1. Positive and reliable identification of users is possible to every
reader of soc.culture.russian.moderated, not only to moderators;

2. Users gain additional protection from man-in-the-middle attacks by
using well protected pseudo-headers withing PGP signed blocks; they
cannot misuse this feature by lying about who they are;

3. Those who do not want to bother do not have to;

4. People with misconfigured email addresses may have at least
some address field ("From: ") set correctly.

5. Nyms can post freely through any anon remailers and always have their
identity show up in the "From: " field, even if remailers do not allow
users to specify their identity at all.

Note that I agree that we need to have a database of MD5 checksums of all
submissions and carefully process duplicates.

What do you think?

	- Igor.
