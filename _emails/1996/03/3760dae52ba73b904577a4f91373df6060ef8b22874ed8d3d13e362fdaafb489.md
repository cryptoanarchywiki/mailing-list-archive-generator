	That depends on one's standards. I prefer text-based interfaces, and
they are needed for many setups.

	Good point. This also argues against the passphrase into the mail
being that much of a problem... with the massive exception of something going
wrong with the mail proxy program so that it lets through the email, with the
passphrase and possibly without any encryption.
	However, as has been pointed out on other aspects of this, one could
have the passphrase entered once (in a special mail message with no valid
To: address, for instance) per session.
