Since my name keeps getting dragged into this discussion, I will share with
youall the conclusions I reached after my last set of exchanges with Jim
Bell.

(1) Assassination Politics (AP) will be most useful to a fired-up group of
people who want to silence a single person.  Madeline Murray O'Hare comes
to mind.  (She was a Texas atheist who challenged school prayer and won.)

(2) Jim Bell and I disagree strongly on the market price for assassinations.

(3) Jim Bell and I disagree on the number of deaths needed to deter someone
who believes in what they do.  In our discussion, this question comes down
to: are IRS employees more like corporate consultants or like soldiers.

(4) I think that if someone can be traced as profiting from a AP death,
e.g. through winning a gamble on the date/time of death, that person's
whereabouts at the time of death will be carefully investigated.

(5) While killing someone whose name and residence are known is easy, and
the killer is likely to get away with it, does that mean that killing
someone who has been marked as having a price on her head is as easy?  I
assume her friends and neighbors will protect her.  The TV cameras will be
running 24 hours a day.  This will, at a minimum raise the price of
assassinations.

Regards (that means you too, Jim Bell) - Bill
