It is also not the place for people like this Unicorn to waste our time with non-responsive messages.  If you don't know what I'm referring to, go back and re-read what I posted to him, and what he posted to me in "response."  You'll discover that he doesn't address my commentary appreciably, and certainly not reliably.  He's wasting your time, and mine, and if you haven't complained to him so far then you have no business complaining to me.

Put him to his proof;  challenge his assumptions.
