This is true. Someone posted a general indictment of the pressure-group 
mentality a few days ago. I agree with most of what the ADL does, but I don't 
like it when *anyone* "exaggerates" like that. I've criticized the ADL, and
I've criticized the Nazis and black-helicopter wackos who also lie and 
"exaggerate" to get financial and moral support.

As Declan found out, I tend to be harshest on friends, because I consider
them most worth saving. I've never aspired to be anything but an independent 
loudmouth, and a FUCKING STATIST, of course.
