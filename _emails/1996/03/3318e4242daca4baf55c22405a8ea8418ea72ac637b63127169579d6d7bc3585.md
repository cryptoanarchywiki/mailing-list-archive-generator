Which "innocents"?  And which "deeply held beliefs"?  I've never advocated 
"savaging innocents."  But I don't consider people who benefit from 
government theft AND actively participate in that theft by being employed by 
that government as "innocents."

 >But after revewing the plenitude of those who have murdered

I notice you used the term, "murdered."  Well, by the strict definition of 
the term, that's merely premeditated killing which is against the law.  In a 
country suitably dictatorial government, defending oneself from agression by 
its agents is, then, "murder."

Sorry, but I don't subscribe to the agressor's (government's) opinion of 
what I may do to him if I were given the opportunity.

Read:  "It selectively focuses on a few, wrong people, and ignores the rest 
who are justified."

Did I get it?

Well, go right ahead.  The Economist is better than most, but I seriously 
doubt that there is going to be anything there that changes my mind.  Maybe 
I ought to email my essay to the author, to see what he thinks of it...

It's hard to provoke a person who is already dead.  If my system were 
operational, those "stormtroopers" wouldn't dare go to work in the morning.  
Or can't you see that?

If we dictate all of our actions based on the fear of what THEY will do, 
then THEY have already won, and we have already lost.
