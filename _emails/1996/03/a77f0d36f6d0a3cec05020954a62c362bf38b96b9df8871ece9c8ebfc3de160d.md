How much of a problem it is depends on the application you're using PGP for,
but yes, it's a concern.  There's a program called "stealth" by "Harry Hastur"
which lets you remove or hide this information, as well as hiding most of
the PGP headers.  (There are some aspects of PGP file structure that are
difficult to hide, at least without doing almost as much work as PGP
was already doing, and I don't know if it adjusts for the mathematical
properties of RSA-encrypted data which make it possible to identify the
public key over some number of messages.)

When the new PGP 3.0 comes out, there will be some support for
shorter keyIDs (which isn't perfect, but for instance a 4-bit keyID
would let you not try to decrypt 15/16ths of the messages,
while not really fingering you as the recipient.)

Also, if you have someone you frequently correspond with on some topic
(perhaps a mailing list) and want to be able to send them messages that
don't identify them, have them generate a public key they use just for 
that application.  You can send your request by anonymous remailer,
and they can send you a reply by anonymous remailer or post to
alt.anonymous.messages.  This still permits traffic analysis 
(nobody knows who keyid 0x12345678 is, but they know you sent him
ten messages in the last month.)

Yep.  That was the original PGP approach (i.e. "do nothing special"), and
multiple-recipients were added as an efficiency measure.
