Could anyone direct me to some other mailing lists dealing with either 
computer security or current communication technology, routers,modems 
etc.  Thank you ahead of time.  Also could anyone direct me to some good 
beginner books on cryptography of computer security. When referring 
books could you make them recent so that they would be regularly 
available at Barnes&Noble or Borders.  

Thanks
