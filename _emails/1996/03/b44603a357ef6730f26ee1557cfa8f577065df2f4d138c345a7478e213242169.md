IBM is also running such a service.  It's called InfoMarket and it does 
the same thing.  You load the trojan, uh.., I mean "client," onto your 
box, and then it listens to the channels for you and puts up on the 
screen the tasty bits that you want.  Of course, on a DOS box, it can 
also put all sorts of other stuff onto your computer.

And, of course, after the "trial period" you'll be charged to dine at 
their info-trough.

( InfoMarket bullshit is at http://www.infomkt.ibm.com/ )
