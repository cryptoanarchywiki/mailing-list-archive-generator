The regulation in question was regarding things like local/state/federal
telecom taxes and levies, and all of the BS hoops that LD carriers must
jump through.  Regarding where such companies are located, I am also at
a loss as to how this recent action will be enforced; that does not
necessarily mean that a bureaucrat somewhere will not try to do something
stupid.

Just because LD is "deregulated" does not mean that it is without any
governmental oversight, much as I wish it were...  LD companies still
have to pay certain taxes (take a look at your next phone bill, they are
clearly listed in addition to your actual phone charges) and I am certain
that they have entire office buildings stuffed with drones filling out
paperwork for Uncle Sam...
