Don't know about Intel, but IBM has an agreement with US-legislation,
that we can ship code, hardware and knowledge freely between all of
our locations.  An export-licence is only required when code/hardware
leaves the IBM-corporation.

Technically IBM-Germany is a _German_ company, so that ITAR would not
effect IBM-Germany.  However, the agreement between IBM-corporation
and US-legislation does have the desired effect (desired by US-legislation).


This seems to be the way how ITAR is enforced with multinational
corporations: they allow the very valuable exchange of knowledge, for
the prize of the corporation as a whole `voluntarily' obeying ITAR.


Of course all the usual disclaimers apply, ie I'm not a lawyer, don't
speak for IBM and the weather is not my fault either....


Have a nice day!
Olmur
