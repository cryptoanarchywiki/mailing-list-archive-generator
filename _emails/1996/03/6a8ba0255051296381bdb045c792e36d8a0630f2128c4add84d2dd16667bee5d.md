Don't know if it's a full-time income or not, but there are certainly
several people offering commercial products for cracking Microsoft
and other popular word processor encryption for people who've lost
their passwords.  And people who are designing good cryptosystems
to protect information have to understand how to crack them, so they
can tell whether their new system is stronger or weaker.
But there's usually not much other legitimate need for cracking
real messages; the authorized people usually have the keys.

Whether there are also Bad Guys doing the job for profit,
I don't know.
