Untrue.

I see no reason whatsoever to believe that an un-warranted wiretap would 
be legal in any but two cases.  (1) Emergency threatening life (e.g. 
hostage-taking) pending judicial authorizaiton -- very rare.
(2) The president claims residual authority to wiretap on national 
security grounds without a court order.  Since the FISA court provides 
the authority, this (one is told) is not used.

There is no question that the Justice dept is very cagey about not ever 
admitting that one has an exhausive list of means by which they claim the 
authority to tap.  If some other tap is in use, however, it is an awfully 
well-kept secret, which argues that it is used for inltellignece and not 
law enforcement.  LEOs can't keep that kind of secret any more.
