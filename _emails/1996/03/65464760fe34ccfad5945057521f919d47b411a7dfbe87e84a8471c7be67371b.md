My most recent mention of this was a few days ago, where I cited Carl
Nicolai, inventor of the suppressed "PhasorPhone," as my source. He and his
lawyer got access to papers inside the NSA building, though they could not
make copies. They found memos from NSA staffers saying that the ITARs had
never been tested in court and would not likely survive a full
Consitutional test and that it would thus be best if court cases were
avoided.

I passed this information along to the Lee Tien, representing Gilmore in
various cases, and to Phil Karn.
