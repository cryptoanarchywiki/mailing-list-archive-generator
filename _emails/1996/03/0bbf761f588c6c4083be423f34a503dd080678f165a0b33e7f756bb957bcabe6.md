Seems to me that you could set up a pseudonymous account, then mail the list owner from that account.  She'll get you first couple of messages before she realizes it's you.  If you can be persuasive enough in these messages that she'll re-instate you on the list, you're good to go.

If she doesn't decide to re-instate you, set up an alias somewhere, and subscribe to the list using that alias.

Fucking up the mailing list is NOT something you should even consider.  Childish and irresponsible behavior is seldom a means of gaining respect.
