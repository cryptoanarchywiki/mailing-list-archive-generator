I, at least, want to know something of the language of the countries I
travel in.  Being able to get a meal or a room for the night is useful.  As
a rock bottom minimum, I want to know the phrases: Hello, Good by, Please,
Thank You, More beer please, and Where's the bathroom.

The look of pleased surprise on the face of the Budapest resident when I
said "Thank you" to in Hungarian as he gave up his seat to me because I was
loaded down with caving equipment is something I still treasure.

Regards - Bill
