-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I have received reports that some people are getting only partial files
when downloading PGP and PGPfone with our new distribution server. This
problem is caused by higher then normal packet loss on the Internet.

Some browsers (notably the AOL browser) give up when they fail to
receive any more data for a period of time (caused by high losses or
other conditions that block our server).

For now people should continue to attempt to download PGPfone and PGP
until they get a good copy. Trying late at or on weekends when the net
load is lower may help.

I am working on a "fix" where our server will let the browser know up
front (there is a way to do that with http) how large an item to expect.
This hopefully will improve the situation, if not complete fix it.
However this change will not be installed until at least Tuesday. So if
you can wait, you might want to wait until Tuesday if you are having
difficulties getting a complete distribution from MIT.

Note: I will send out another message when this fix is in place.
