I'm a non-american living in the us, benefiting from writing crypto (or 
at least implementing stuff based on crypto primitives). You need to 
get an export licence, but I gather they're normally pretty automatic.

I don't know if this depends on nationality though

They say in  online country             So which side are you on boys
There is no middle way                  Which side are you on
You'll either be a Usenet man           Which side are you on boys
Or a thug for the CDA                   Which side are you on?
