Major problem here is that ten million horny geeks are likely to bring 
your server to its knees, but if one only has one image, and it is 
moderately small, say thirty thousand bytes, perhaps the flood would 
taper off eventually.

Here James has stated the crux of the problem in its basic, elementary form.   Why cannot legislators, the courts, and all those socially responsible individuals promoting the CDA and their other complaints against indecency recognize the obvious:

that the problem of the presence of (and the success of) alarmingly objectionable material on the internet is all due to the existence of all those "ten million horny geeks", who en masse can actually "bring servers to their knees".

I think this is a Male vs Male problem, and personally I think the mature and wise men of the world should take the case in hand and deal with it on a Man-to-Man basis.

Or, they could just adopt Assassination Politics and do away with all those "other people's" (horny) internet-addicted male children.

(Ha-ha.   Really, Jim -  any "democratic society" where one group elects a governor and another group votes to to shoot that person down sounds more like a Bosnian/Serv "society".  It wouldn't make sense to become a member of such a disfunctional, self-defeating group of misfits in the first place.)
