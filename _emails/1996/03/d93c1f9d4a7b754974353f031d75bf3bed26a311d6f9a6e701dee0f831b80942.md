	My expectation would be that your numbers are not random in a
cryptographic sense, and that this route of attack is much less
efficient than others that would be used.

	I'll note that PGP does NOT take your data entered and convert
it to numbers, but takes timings to choose a hard to predict starting
point for its prime searching.

	I'd expect this use of timings is better than using the large
random number you entered, but in a theory sense only.  Both are
pretty difficult; thats why we like large numbers. :)
