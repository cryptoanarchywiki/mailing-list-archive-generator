Bruce Schnier (Author of applied cryptography) and Matt Blaze (Who
is a crypto bigwig at at&t) have made it clear that they support
key escrow. Both have written letters in favor of the new crypto
law, it creates a key escrow system and also other restricts on
crypto. The letters are on the CDT homepage and i think were
posted here.

WHAT THE FUCK??????????????????????????????????????????

EFF, EPIC, VTW and almost everyone else (except for Bizdos at RSA, hmmmm)
have all come out against this piece of shit. But with these so called
experts baking it it could pass anyway.

Maybe the ltrs are a forgery? We should ask them, and if this is true, LETS
SEND THEM A MESSAGE!!!!!!!! SWITCH YOUR PHONE SERVICE AND TELL AT&T WHY!!!
STOP RECOMMENDING APPLIED CRYPTO (THERE ARE EASIER BOOKS ANYWAY). DEMAND
THAT THESE PEOPLE STOP GIVING AWAY YOUR RIGHTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

their addresses are
       schneier@counterpane.com
       mab@crypto.com
       jim@rsa.com
