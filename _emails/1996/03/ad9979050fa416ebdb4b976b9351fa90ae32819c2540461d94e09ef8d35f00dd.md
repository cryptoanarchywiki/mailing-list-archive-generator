Entirely brushing aside the idea that there might be more to the world than
technical fields, my observation has been that knowing at least one
foreign language would be an enormous professional advantage. At one
computer company I worked for, the only person who could speak Italian was
in constant demand as an informal translator. Doing research, I have had
a number of occasions to regret my lack of proficiency with a foreign
language. I regularly come into contact with German and Spanish speaking
scientists. (Probably number one on the hit parade is Chinese, but I'm
kind of daunted by the idea of taking it on ;-). Granted, English is
the technical lingua franca, but the statement that there's no point in
learning a foreign language is shortsighted, and I think that will become
more true, not less, in the future.

And besides, you only need Spanish for maids, gardeners, and day-laborers,
right?
