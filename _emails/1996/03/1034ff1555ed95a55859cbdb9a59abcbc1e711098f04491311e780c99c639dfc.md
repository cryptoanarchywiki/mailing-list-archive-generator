Well, no.  Or yes and no. Something like Public-Key crypto in general, 
where the public key isn't enough knowledge to decrypt it.  For example, 
you could encrypt a session key with RSA.

Well, that's what I want to avoid; I think the issue is that as long as 
stego is predictable, there's a problem, ie a message to a certain party 
can be shown to exist, even if it's not readable. This might prove more 
than ample evidence in certain circumstances.

You shouldn't be able to recover the stego'd message without special 
knowledge.  This isn't addressed by current software, to my knowledge.
