re: Two "libertarian" interviews...

Hi!

Last month I interviewed Phil Zimmermann, the author of PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy) and last summer, I interviewed Jim Warren about public access to
government information (and vice-versa).  I have transcribed both these
interviews and found your name on the Web as someone who might be interested
in these two items.  

The Zimmermann interview is at:
http://www.animatedsoftware.com/hightech/philspgp.htm
and the Jim Warren interview is at:
http://www.animatedsoftware.com/hightech/jimwarre.htm

I hope you will find these interviews interesting and will want to link to
them.  Thank you in advance for your consideration.
