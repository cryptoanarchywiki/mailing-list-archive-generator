Peter Wayner's work on Mimic Functions does just this sort of thing.
You can describe a grammar, feed it random bits, and generate output that
has the right statistics and can be reversed to get the original bits.
His paper was on cs.cornell.edu a few years ago; don't know where
to find it now.  AltaVista yields a reference to the paper in Cryptologia,
and the Cyphernomicon has the following:
              - "They encode a secret message inside a harmless looking
              ASCII text file.  This is one of the very few times
              the UNIX tools "lex" and "yacc" have been used in
              cryptography, as far as I know.   Peter Wayner, "Mimic
              Functions", CRYPTOLOGIA Volume 16, Number 3, pp. 193-214,
              July 1992.[Michael Johnson, sci.crypt, 1994-09-05]

(When I read the Cryptologia reference on my browser, I don't get the
ligature in the middle of "Huffman coding"; YMMV. :-)
