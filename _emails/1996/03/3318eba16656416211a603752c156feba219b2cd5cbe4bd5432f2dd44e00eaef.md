There is *some* justice in America.  The University of Wyoming had a Campus
Cop named Waters, who also worked for Information Technology and fancied
himself becoming the next Internet Sherlock Holms.  Unfortunately, IT canned
his ass for alleged violations of privacy before he could make a career out
of electronic snooping.  The closest he came to me in all the years I 
was using unauthorized access there, was giving me a ticket for driving on an
expired license.

Now days I'm getting too legit to quit.  Prof Van Baalen bought my idea of
Free Public Internet Access for Wyoming residents on a self educational UNIX
box, a spare Sparc 10 wired at T1 speed.  We go online by the Equinox >;)
