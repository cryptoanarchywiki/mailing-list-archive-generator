Pat's report was much better, and it's worth wondering why NIST 
bothered to send out this "unofficial" summary rather than one 
of its own professional reports. Perhaps to flash the name of a 
big corporation as evidence of industry input, perhaps to 
induce paranoia that something else is going on beneath the 
camouflage and shrewd business better get on board.


I'm nasty enough to think that NIST hopes this throwaway will 
sedate their opponents.


Recall that the Administration has not really responded to 
authentic, open, industry criticism. And seems to be 
stonewalling in public while making mutually beneficial 
arrangements favored insiders -- like Martin Marietta, eager to 
claim, with relief, that nothing of importance happened at the 
meeting to upset covert deals?
