That just about sums it up.

Chisel these in granite:

o Thou shall not execute untrusted code. Java or no Java.
o Privileges that an user doesn't have can't be abused.
o The only safe firewall is a non-networked computer.
o A feature that doesn't exist won't introduce security holes.

Yes, I know that there is a balance between functionality and security.
Where to draw the line depends on the application.
