  Thank you for registering in the Switchboard database.
Your Switchboard login is:

     Email: cypherpunks@toad.com
  Password: DrawLint

This password is case sensitive.

  Once you log in (set your browser to http://www.switchboard.com),
your entry appears in the directory with your email address
attached.  You may then update your listing to show
exactly the information you want and correct errors.
Note that Switchboard waits until you log in to change the
directory, because this step verifies that your email address
is correct.

  Logging in also allows you to create an additional
listing, change your password, list your home page URL,
unlist your main listing, and access other features.

  Once you are logged in, please change your password to make it
easier to remember.

  If you did not register in Switchboard and received this message
