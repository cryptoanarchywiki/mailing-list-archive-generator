"Cypherpunk" is not a trademarked name. I've seen people say on this list
(paraphrased) "I'm a cypherpunk, and I oppose unrestricted free speech
because we must silence {homophobes}child pornographers|terrorists}" or
"I'm hosting a cypherpunks meeting and X will not be permitted to come
because I don't like his political views". I like reading this list, but
if these views are compatible with being a cypherpunk, then I'm not one.
