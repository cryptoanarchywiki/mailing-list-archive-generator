My mistake...  The publication I was thinking of was "the Journal of
Cryptology".  They reference Springer-Verlag New York Inc. as the source for
back issues, but there is no listing on the linked web page for that journal
and the search engine returns nothing for that journal.  (They do have a few
other things of interest however...)

The time spent was not a loss...  I found a number of interesting things on
the web and recieved a number of pointers to books I was not aware of and
are not listed in any of the FAQs.

The best site I found was at:

http://mnementh.cs.adfa.oz.au/htbin/bib_lpb

It is for Lawries Cryptography Bibliography.  It contains a search engine to
a large listing of crypto articles.  Worth checking out.
