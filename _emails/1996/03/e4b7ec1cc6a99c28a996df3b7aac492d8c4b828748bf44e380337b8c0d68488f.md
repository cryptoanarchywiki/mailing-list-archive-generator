Really? I'm sure some of them are, but I remember reading in G. Gordon Liddy's
"Will" that  FBI Agents were assigned to check up on novelist Nelson Algren ("Man
With the Golden Arm") who was living with Simone de Beauvoir at the time. Seeing
both names on the mailbox of the residence, the agents filled in the surveillance
form with Subject: Nelson Algren, alias Simone de Beauvoir.
