Minnesota Online Privacy Bill in Conference Committee is in Conference Committee
3-27-1996

The following online privacy option bill passed the full Minnesota State
House and is now in conference committee with a "study" passed
today by the State Senate.  The various interests, including major
commercial on-line services, woke up to the bill and found Senate members
to amend their version which was similar to the House's on the floor with
a short bill that would instead require study.

It is a pretty incredible story that the House bill (following after this
intro) has gotten so far without major attention.
