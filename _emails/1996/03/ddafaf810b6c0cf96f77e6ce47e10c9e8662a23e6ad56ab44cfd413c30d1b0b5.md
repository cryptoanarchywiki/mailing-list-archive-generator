I'd always assumed it was just the ugly X.400 email naming convention.

I don't see how a DN is any better than an Internet-style Domain Naming Service
name, except that it puts a bunch of pre-defined labels on subdomain parts
which can generally be guessed from context and aren't very relevant
to computer programs.  Compare
        joeuser@purchasing.fnord.edu.au
vs.     /FN=Joseph/Ln=User/NN=Joe/OU=Purchasing/O=First.National.Organization.-
[for].Research.[and].Development/S=Academic/C=AU/

Is there really any additional information in the latter, except possibly
some detail you could have looked up with a "whois" request?
