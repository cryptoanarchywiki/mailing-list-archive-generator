Having worked on a secure OS, with a small security kernel etc. etc. etc. I
realize that even those systems have bugs.  The Java people will work out
their bugs.  Others will read their code and find more bugs.  (It is to
Sun's GREAT credit that they are releasing their source under a not very
restrictive license.)  Eventually, in several years, Java security will be
ready for prime time.

Of course, for really valuable things, or the really paranoid, you
shouldn't connect your computer to a network.  The top dog certificate key
in SET is handled this way.
