However, there is a case to be made that a basic difference between a 
magazine, in this example, and source code exists.

The magazine itself is the instrumentality.  When it's mailed to you, you 
can give it to whomever you like.  The pages and paper are your property, 
along with the ink.

In the case of the code, it is itself the instrumentality.  Handing it 
out for free (unsolicited and without a binding NDA) might render the 
item itself (the code) public domain.  (Or more accurately, the 
act of so distributing it renders it defacto in the public 
domain).  Especially in the context in which this code was released.

I'm not sure it's a compelling argument in and of itself, but in the 
context of the manner of distribution, and the major goof on the part of 
IDG in releasing the material generally, I would suspect no one has much 
to worry about.  Asking for a public review of material, and then 
enforcing "copyrights" when that review releases some of, perhaps even 
all of the material is rather silly.  I'd be surprised if a court paid 
much attention.
