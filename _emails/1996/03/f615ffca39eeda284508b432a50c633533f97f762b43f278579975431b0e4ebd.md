You'd be surprised how many of them are doing the "message XOR key" stuff
that so many of us wrote when were, as Roy Scheider put it in 'Blue
Thunder', "young and stupid".  Also, S-boxes are a fancy way of getting
yourself into a lot of trouble while promoting a false sense of security -
they are *very* hard to get right, and it takes a lot of work to prove
that you haven't introduced a weakness with the "improvement".  See "S-Box
Design" in Schneier's book, page 349 for a good intro to designing such.
