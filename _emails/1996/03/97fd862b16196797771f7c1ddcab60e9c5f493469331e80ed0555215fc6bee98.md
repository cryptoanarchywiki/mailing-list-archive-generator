Sure you do: Goodlatte's more direct prohibition on the Exec. branch 
mandating Key Escrow.  What's the problem here?  We know Goodlatte's 
version, on this provision at very least, is better. Why can't we just 
agree that it is, and support that?  Goodlatte's bill isn't competing 
with Leahy's, they were introduced simultaneously in different chambers, 
and are intended to get the same message across. I can't see a problem 
with saying "we like this particular phrasing better, let's have it in 
both versions."  The entire point of all this is to have the same bill on 
both sides of Congress anyway.  It can either happen early, or (on the 
off chance it ever gets that far) in conference committee. Here we have a 
large say. In conf. cmte. we have almost no say.  Again, what's the problem?
What are we arguing about?

I disagree.  A better thing we can write into law is to simultanously 
have rights reaffirmed, and send a more direct message to the Admin that it 
cannot tread here.

> Let's not soft-pedal this legislation.  

Let's not hard sell flawed parts of it, when fixes are not just 
available but already introduced as "live" legislation.

Certainly.

No kidding.

I expect either an attempt to mandate escrow, a worsening of the export 
controls, and/or an all-out assault on American's rights to encrypt at 
all, or without some kind of worse-than-GAK registry or licensing.  If 
not all of the above.
