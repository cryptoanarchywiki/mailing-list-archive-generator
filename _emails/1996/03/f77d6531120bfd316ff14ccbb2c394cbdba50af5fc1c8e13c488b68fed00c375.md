He's one of the people I haven't seen respond to the Leahy bill, as well.  
However, I don't regularly read SCI.CRYPT or much else  that he may put his 
comments on, and I don't recall if he commented here.  That's one of the 
reasons to be suspicious of the motivations behind the "list of shame," 
however there's good reason to be even  more suspicious of those who have 
rushed to debunk it by "standing behind" all those listed, with no 
distinction.    I think it is obvious that at least a few people listed 
should have been listed, but the majority I simply don't know about.  I 
wouldn't be surprised if at least one of those anonymous messages 
deliberately loaded up the list  with unworthy targets simply to disguise 
the ones who ought to be listed.
