I would be very grateful for pointers to data concerning the number of
messages that pass through remailers.  (Not anon.penet.fi -- real
remailers.) I am currently in a conversation with a journalist who should
know better, but claims that secure anonymous remailers are never used by
anyone -- just a curiosity.
