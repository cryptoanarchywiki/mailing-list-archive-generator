Look above, note the "To:" Field, hmmmm, the offending l party mailed a responce 
to an anon remailer.

I have noticed a couple people do this latley.

Please people - THINK, you have just proved beond a shadow of a doubt that you 
are crypto illiterate.

The message is not sent back to the origional sender, it is either qued in the 
remailer's In basket, till the remailer administrator cleans it out, or it is 
trashed upon reciept since it does not have the required Request-Remailing-To: 
format.

*sigh*, I will spare the offending parties the well deserved "Come back when 
you get a clue" flame.
