Ther is always the posibility of disinformation. That is one of the
governments specialties. I'm not saying the posibility isn't there, I'm
sure there are anon remailers run by the government. An I remember from a
show on PBS I watched months ago in which someone from inside the CIA said
that the government does actively monitor the Internet and has for a long
time.

The thing to remember is to PGP your important mail and sign everything....
