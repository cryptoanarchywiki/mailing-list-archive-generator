I won't enumerate all the economic and technical errors in this
message; they are numerous and this isn't the correct forum. It is my
personal hope that free banking (that is, competitive currency issue
by banks without regulation) will some day again be the rule as it
once was, and that electronic mechanisms will be a portion of the way
that currency works under a free banking system. However, that does
not mean that fractional reserve banking (which isn't even what the
Fed does), debt currency (all notes are debt currency), etc. are
wrong, or that the Fed is a private organization. I'll happily discuss
this in private mail if anyone wishes.

Cryptographically secured electronic money does, of course, provide
the promise to have banks, especially ones outside of the
U.S. regulatory regime, issue their own money and have it freely
circulate even in places like, say, China, or the U.S., where such
money might not be technically legal. However, to do that, it will be
necessary for some financial institution that people have substantial
confidence in to fill this role. Money is partially about trust, and
cryptography can only go so far in convincing people that their
savings are secure. Even encrypted "open books" protocols like the
ones Eric Hughes has proposed can only go so far in preventing
systematic frauds.
