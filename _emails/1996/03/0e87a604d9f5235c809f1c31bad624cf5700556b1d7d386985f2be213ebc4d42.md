Granted.  Of course it is quite a jump to claim that a software program is a
"Long Distance Carrier."  If I run Winsock on my machine and a Winsock
application like Iphone, if anyone is the LD carrier, *I* am because I am
digitizing my voice and doing the first part of the switching necessary to
send the packets on their way.  Maybe the FCC should bust *me* for
practicing telecommunications without a license.  It would make for an
interesting case.
