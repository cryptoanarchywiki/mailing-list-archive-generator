It's my clipper article, see the link from my homepage.  The claim 
(disputed, BTW, by many experts) is that it's not obvious that the 
constitution allows judges to hold keys in the absence of an onging 
judicial proceeding involving the owner of the key because the separation 
of powers would classify this action as "executive".

I agree that absent a statute all that is involved is contract law.

NO IT DOES NOT.  Basic rule of thumb: your lawyer can't be used to hide 
papers someone else can't hide.  Ok, at the margin it gets tricky, but 
bascially the privilege is not going to stretch to your key.

An interesting issue, likely to be addressed in future judicial 
assistence treaties...
