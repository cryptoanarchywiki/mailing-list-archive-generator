For the record, Netcom has always accepted personal checks mailed in to
them. The credit card debit was offered as a convenience to those who
wanted it; it was and remains optional.

The "credit card numbers were stolen" point, that I believe Ed Carp was
referring to, had to do with the Mitnick affair, and is very old news.

I no longer use Netcom as my primary account, but thought some
misconceptions needed correcting.

I don't plan to debate the merits of Netcom, Mitnick, etc., and will post
no more on this topic.
