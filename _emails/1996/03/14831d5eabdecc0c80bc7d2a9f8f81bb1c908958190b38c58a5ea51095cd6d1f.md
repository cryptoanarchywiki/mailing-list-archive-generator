I'm sure that my friend who tried to argue about a speeding ticket in New
Jersey, had the bones around his eye socket broken and then was arrested
for "Resisting Arrest" will be comforted to hear this.  (BTW, a mutual
friend was a witness and confirmed the story.  I can't think of any reason
they would have to lie to me about the facts.)
