More ALL.NET spew, hit D now if you don't care.

A user of system, or something triggered the initial email to our
postmaster account here at DHP.  I replied with a rewording of the
message, as seen below.  This resulted in Fred Cohen deciding that I was
part a huge consipiracy to invade his computer system and decided that
CERT needed to get in on the mailings.  Based on the services available
via ALL.NET's web page, I find this quite funny, so I replied to both CERT
and his provider, PSI.  Please be sure to check out the provided URL's 
available at ALL.NET.

My included response to CERT and , including all previous email in quoted 
form.

This administrator at all.net (I assume the whois information is true) is 
making unwarrented threats and accusations.  These threats and warnings 
coming from a site that offers to do port scans on any host via a web 
interface is quite absurd.

The systems administrator at the following site is apparently a party to
the attmpted entry to our site reported below.  What is the procedure for
contacting federal authorities to investigate attempted breakins to
Federal Interest Computers?
