There is no truth to the rumours that they are POTP or IPG licencees. If you
beat level 10, an animated Jim Bizdos comes out and does a little dance

Take a copy along when you do your visit for  NetDay

They say in  online country             So which side are you on boys
There is no middle way                  Which side are you on
You'll either be a Usenet man           Which side are you on boys
Or a thug for the CDA                   Which side are you on?
