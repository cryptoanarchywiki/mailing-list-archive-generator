Last Friday, Judge Richey issued a 36-page opinion dismissing my suit
against the State Dept.

I am waiting for a copy of the opinion, which should arrive in paper
form tomorrow. I'll post it on my web site when it's available in
electronic form. (http://www.qualcomm.com/people/pkarn/export)

I'll be meeting my attorneys next Monday to plan an appeal strategy.

Phil
