It sounds like you're making much better contact with your representatives
than I've ever been able to make with mine.  Whenever I call or write I
have the impression that I'm just talking with a receptionist who either
does nothing with my comment or just puts it on a tally sheet of some
kind.

Do you know something about lobbying that I don't?  Or do your Senators' 
staffers know about your reputation as an expert who ought to be listened 
to?  When you call up a Senator's office, who do you ask to speak to?  
How do you find out which staffer would carry the ball on a particular 
issue?

I'm sure we'd all make the effort to lobby if we felt it was making a 
difference.
