  You don't know what you're talking about - it's as simple as that.  When someone points out to you the error of your ways using terms you're not familiar with, then display that at least one brain cell is working and look up the terms.
  Your response that you don't use them is childish.  Was it meant to imply that you and George Will have formed a *Proud to be Stupid* club?
