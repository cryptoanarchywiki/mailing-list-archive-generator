At one point I'd thought about setting up a "random" crontab on my
local machine to send out encrypted junk to remailers over the net via
a SLiRP connection.  It made a little more sense when I was connected
24/7.  I'm still planning on doing this sometime, probably during
Spring Break or this summer.  I don't know how useful it would be,
though.
