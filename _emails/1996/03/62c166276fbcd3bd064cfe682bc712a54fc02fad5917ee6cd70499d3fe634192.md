You want to prove:
(A)
IF you CAN plug in an unapproved module
THEN you CAN plug in a trojan/virus.

That doesn't mean, however, that:
(B)
IF you can't plug in an unapproved module
THEN you can't plug in a trojan/virus.

The subversion mechanisms would just not use the standard API.  
So what have you really proved if you can prove (A)?
