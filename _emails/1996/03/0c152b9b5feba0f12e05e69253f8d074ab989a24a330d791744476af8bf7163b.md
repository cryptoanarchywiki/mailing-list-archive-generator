My experience in China in 1993 was that US Federal Reserve Notes were easy
to use and American Express Traveler's checks were not.  After hearing that
the dollar isn't worth anything, it was refreshing to go to a country where
they are in high demand.  I recommend carrying good old fashioned USA
dollars when going to communist countries.
