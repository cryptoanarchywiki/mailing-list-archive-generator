Justa sec, Tim, the second amendment says, "keep and bear _arms_", not 
merely "guns."  My dictionary defines arms as "objects used as weapons."  
Explosives can be used as weapons, both offensively and defensively.  Are 
you assuming that the possession of ANFO must be offensive?

But again, it appears that you are assuming that "building a bomb" is not 
covered in the 2nd amendment.  I believe, to the contrary, that it very much 
is covered, even if this interpretation isn't very much respected.

>But should law enforcement have waited until the bomb 

"the bomb"?   Again, you're assuming a lot...  
What would you say to a person who buys 1000 pounds of AN, who claims to do 
it because he believes that some day, it might be outlawed or restricted 
severely by an even-more oppressive government?  Is there anything 
illegitimate in anticipating and preparing for the advent of tyranny?

Again, I disagree.  I broadly interpret the 2nd amendment to  mean that I 
should be entitled to possess ANY "objects used as weapons," including 
chemical (both explosives and poisons), biological, and yes, nuclear.  

Thus, the possession of bomb-making materials cannot be interpreted as a 
by-definition-offensive position, and it isn't even clear to be that the 2nd 
amendment isn't supposed to cover weapons whose "only" use is offensive.  
Remember, the people who wrote the 2nd had just fought and won a revolution, 
and they were well aware that people needed the tools to do this if they 
were to stay free.

Not in Oregon!  AN can be bought, without ID, in most places that stock
fertilizer.

True, it wasn't, but that was simply because those people in Oregon didn't 
choose to defend themselves.  Tiny amounts of drugs were found, all of which 
could have been planted by the cops to justify post-facto the raid.  (I'm 
not saying they WERE planted, merely that police are usually fully prepared 
for such eventualities.  Drugs are usually chosen because they are illegal 
per-se, and it's easier to sneak in an ounce of pot than 200 pounds of AN. 
 If they don't find anything suspicious, they usually come prepared to make 
their own evidence.  I know, because one of my best friends is an ex-cop who 
tells me all about this kind of stuff.)
