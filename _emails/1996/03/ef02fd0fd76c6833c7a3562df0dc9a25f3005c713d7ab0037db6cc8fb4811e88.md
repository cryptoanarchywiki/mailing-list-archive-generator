This is not correct:  The FDA has a thoroughly villainous reputation.

Among other things it engages in corruption and extortion.  Companies who
want their stuff approved hire ex FDA "advisors".  There is ample evidence
that these advisors do no actual work, the FDA simply knocks back applications
that fail to pay large sums to their friends.  Indeed one company recently
won a court case on this ground.

The FDA is famous for grotesque scientific incompetence, (as for example its
recent showboating on silicone), for playing to the gallery, for simple
extortion, as a court recently found, for corruptly excluding drugs that 
people who are not well connected wish to sell and for corruptly 
approving the often identical drugs that people who are well connected 
wish to sell, and for a callous and light hearted disregard for human
lives.
