Hello im new to this mailing list and I have seen alot of talk about
re-mailers.  I run my schools netconnection (it was just a Win 3.11 Computer
before i got there) And I have installed Linux 1.2.8 (Slackware 2.3) (T-1
Connect!!!)  I want to setup as mutch anonmized stuff (It whould all be
free) that I can find.  I have wrote shell scripts that let you ftp stuff
and then download it by zmodem.  But i havent benable to find 
WWW Baised Remailer Software or The software that anon.pennet.fi uses (not
sure the name for it) If you have any ideas, or Places where I can find this
software. Please e-mail me
