	Umm... I was referring to the discussion in regards to whether
"smart drugs" work or not, not the discussion on the FDA. Sorry if I wasn't
clear. Admittedly, some of my comments with regards to the FDA's
ultraconservative/better-safe-than-sorry (depending on whose side you take)
policy can be extended to an analysis of the NSA's behavior - putting the
brakes on cryptography even after it becomes useless to do so, and after it
becomes _necessary_ for America's future (commerce et al).
