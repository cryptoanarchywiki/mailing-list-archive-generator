I'm in favor of the Bill because it specifically prevents, by law, the
US Govt from mandating key escrow. Also because it would, by law,
force export control of crypto out of the Dept. of State and into the
Dept.  of Commerce, effectively allowing any crypto used in the US and
"widely available" to be exported. (The bill does a few other things.
One, it provides for criminal penalties for key holders who abuse
their role as an escrow agent, assuming anyone *chose* to use key
escrow.  Second, it makes the use of encryption -any encryption- a
crime if used in the commission of or support of any criminal
activity. I think the bill would be better off without these
provisions, but I suspect this is an attempt to give the
administration something.)

I anticipate that the Administration, led by the intelligence and law
enforcement interests, will vigorously lobby against this bill...
