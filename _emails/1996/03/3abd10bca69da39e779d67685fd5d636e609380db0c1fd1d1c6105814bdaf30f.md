   "Speed Record: One Trillion Bits a Second."

      Fujitsu, NTT and AT&T have succeeded, each separately,
      for the first time in transmitting information at the
      rate of one trillion bits a second through optical
      fiber.

      The system, called RSAC-1, will enable parents and
      teachers to censor Web sites due to violence, sexual
      themes, nudity or offensive language. Other companies
      support the PICS form of censorship in terror of market-
      share loss to the tele-vigilantes.

      [Gates told a Mexican sports stadium audience that no
      real money can be made on the Internet until it has the
      speed to interactively out-hypnotize television.]
