I meant "and how the effects of criminalization fell mainly on the poor and
inner-city folks."

Just thought I should make this clear, because many who advocate drug laws
do so out of some notion that by illegalizing some drug they are _helping_
the poor folks. In fact, they are helping to destroy inner cities by making
illegal drugs a profitable thing to trade.

And since people living in cities are more likely to come in contact with
police than are folks living in suburban areas, the implications of
illegality are even more strongly felt.

Far removed from crypto, except the the sort of thinking that says the FDA
and DEA know best what people ought to be allowed to buy and ingest is very
similar to the thinking that government agencies know best what codes and
ciphers people ought to be allowed to use.

Boycott "Big Brother Inside" software!
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
