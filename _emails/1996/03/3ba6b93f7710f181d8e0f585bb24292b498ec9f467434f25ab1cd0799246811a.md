I was at Microsoft the other day and one of the sales guys told 
me that there is a fix for the IIS (Internet Information Server) 
that makes it run on Windows NT Workstation.  There is something 
in the registry that the application checks.  He backed out from 
giving me the fix.  I guess they want to sell more NT Server 
than Workstation.  It maybe something you may want to watchout 
for.
