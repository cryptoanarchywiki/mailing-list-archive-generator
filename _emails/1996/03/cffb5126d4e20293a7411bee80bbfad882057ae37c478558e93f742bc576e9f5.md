While poking around at www.ustreas.gov, I found the following:

		http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/sba/electro.html

The first paragraph reads:

--SNIP--
The Financial Management Service is implementing an Electronic
Certification System to permit fast, secure, and accurate transmission and
certification of payment data. The system has been approved by the General
Accounting Office for satisfying the signature certification requirements
of 31 U.S.C. 3325 and 3528. 
--SNIP--

Would anyone like to comment on what is being used to provide 
signatures?  

Reading on down a bit, we get to this:

--SNIP--

It uses a microcomputer to generate voucher schedules,
electronically certify the vouchers, and transmit them via a dial-up
telephone line to a mainframe host computer at the servicing Regional
Financial Center. 

The electronic certification process provides positive identification of
the certifying officer who authorizes the voucher for payment and ensures
the authenticity of the transmitted data. 

It also detects any deliberate or inadvertent manipulation, modification,
and loss of data between the time the voucher is certified in the Federal
Program Agency microcomputer and the time it is verified at the servicing
Regional Financial Center host computer.
--SNIP--

Comments?
