Maybe I just don't know much about automated remailers, but I don't 
understand why you said that the passphrase "has to be" in plaintext in the 
script file.  I find this hard to believe.  While I am far from an expert on 
cryptographic matters, I would assume that any received attempt at a 
password could be securely hashed (128 bits?) and compared with a pre-stored 
hash value.   If it's the same, it's assumed that the password was correct.

What's wrong with this?
