The Leahy bill is actually much better than Stanton lets on.  Take a
look at it, it affirms Americans' right to choose whatever algorithm or
technique they'd like, as well as takes great pains to go on record to
say that Congress treaded very carefully to preserve Americans' right
to not use key escrow algorithms, and if they did, not to use escrow
agents.  You don't get much more of a guarantee than that.

Regardless of the ulterior motives of the White House, key escrow
programs are still voluntary as read on the books.  The best we can
write into a law is to have our rights reaffirmed.  Leahy has given
this to us in spades.

Let's not soft-pedal this legislation.  Leahy and Goodlatte are going
head to head with the White House to undermine the strongarm export
tactics of Clipper and Son of Clipper.  They've stuck their necks out for
us, we need to back them up.

Just wait until the White House starts to act in reaction to this.  It's
not going to be pretty....
