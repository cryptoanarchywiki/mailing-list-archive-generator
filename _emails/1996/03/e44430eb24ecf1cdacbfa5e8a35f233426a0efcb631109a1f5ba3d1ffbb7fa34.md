Strange how religion and monetary markets work.
They both demand the suspension of fact and or physical items in favor of
some ethereal object or person's view of reality.

I'm not saying that the dollar is some object that does not physically exist,
I'm just saying that the value inherent is no longer based on a physical item.

Question. 
If e-cash were backed by gold would that make it more reliable than say the 
dollar?  


PGP encrypted mail preferred.
