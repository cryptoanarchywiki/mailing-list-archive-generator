: Is the document mentioned the equivalent (with similar legal standing) of the
: US ITAR?

: When the Scandinavian countries join the EU next year, what will the 
: implications for crypto be? France bans it, is there any EU policy proposal?
:

The EU has published a plan of action for how to proceed into the
informationsociety.

->  COM(94) 347 def.
    Brussels, 19.07.1994
    
This document only states that: 
(translated from dutch, lousy english I know)

The Commision plans, advised by a group of officials concerning the 
security of informationsystems, to make a proposal in september 1994
for requirements that encryption systems and signature verification
systems must follow.

[..]

The Community will research the possiblities for cooperation in the
field of encryption with third countries, notably the US.



Other relevant publications are:

->  COM(94) 128 def.
    COD 288
    Brussels, 13.06.1994  
    
    ISDN and mobile networks (cellular for US folks)
    
    
->  COM(92) 422
    
    Outline of Privacy Protection
    

[If you are in the EU, most University Law Libraries will have these
documents, in the US or elsewhere one should look for an depository
Library for EU publications]
