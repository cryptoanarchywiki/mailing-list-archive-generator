     A tad succinct, but perhaps not too far offbase. Is it fair to say
that we support the free flow of information, and place the responsibility
for maintaining the privacy of that information on the party said
information concerns?

     Now, I know that saying "we" has certain implications, mainly that of
a list consensus. However, it seems that a great many people here seem to
post to that regard. Am I correct in my observation?
