The latest "Scientific American," September 1994, has an excellent
article entitled "Software's Chronic Crisis," by W. Wayt Gibbs.

It discusses a lot of issues related to crypto, especially to the
deployment of robust systems that can be built upon. Brad Cox is
quoted.

I'm not going to type in sections--go out and find this issue
yourself. If you want to.
