I think most of us understand this is what "pseudonymity" means...we
only use "anonymous" as shorthand for this. You can quibble about
this, and I might agree that the more awkward "pseudonymous" is a
better term, but no one is being misled into thinking that "anonymous"
means truly anonymous, with no credentials, no reputation, no trail.
