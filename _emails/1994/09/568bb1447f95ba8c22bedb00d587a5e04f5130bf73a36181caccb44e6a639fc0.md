Hi there --

I haven't seen this mentioned, or maybe I missed it, but doesn't
the following message scare you? ... no tax-return filing
electronically without fingerprints on file? ... how are CPA's
and lawyers somehow exempt??? doubleplusungood.

NEW RULES FOR FILING ELECTRONICALLY
With the number of fraudulent claims for tax refunds increasing,
the IRS is tightening up on who can file returns electronically.
New applicants must be 21 years old, must be U.S. citizens or
have permanent resident alien status, must authorize a credit
check and agree to be fingerprinted.  Lawyers, CPAs and enrolled
agents need only show proof of their professional status. (Wall
Street Journal 9/21/94 A1)
