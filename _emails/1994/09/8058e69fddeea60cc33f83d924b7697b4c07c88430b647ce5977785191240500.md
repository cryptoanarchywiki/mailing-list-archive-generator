I'm not sure that's a good solution.  When the Bad Guys go to the site
that originated the message and say "we want Alfred E. Neuman at
your site" (for publication of plans of some sort of machine), the
remailer operator could get busted for aiding & abetting.  Sure, Alf's
real life human will be safe, but it'd be nice to protect the remailer
operator, too.

True, the "identity stripping" can be done by a remailer as well;
However, it's trivial enough to do at the mailing list software level
(simply not including information) that it seems like it's not a bad
thing to do.  

Now, this won't give protection from traffic analysis;  In was suggestion,
I was really blurring two seperate lines of thought (I'm interested in 
PGPified mailing list software for content-hiding reasons; I'm trying to
set up a "distributed business" that I'd like to keep secure). 
Also, though, I'm not sure I want to count on anonymous remailers being
available.  If people want to effectively "chain" them, that's fine.

Sure.  I'm familiar with AMS (in fact, one of my business partners is
one of the current news/postmasters at CMU, and is helping design and
produce IMAP, its replacement).  Another, better I think, possibility is
to add headers and let the MUA sort it out: you don't have to depend upon
non RFC-822 features in the MTA.  Nonstandardness is not a game you want
to get into for things like e-mail unless you have the sort of clout that
CMU/Andrew does.

I'm not sure I buy that duplication of function is a bad thing in this
case: throwing information away more than once can't be worse than
only throwing it away once, can it?
  -----
I do have a couple questions that aren't terribly related:

	- Are there any known PK message formats that commute?  It seems
	 clear to me that PGP and RIPEM do not, since that makes no
	 sense for private key ciphers like DES/3DES and IDEA.

	- What I want (for other purposes) is a mailing list that has
	 its own public key; Material is encrypted to it, it decrypts it,
	 and then the material is encrypted with each recipient's public
	 key (I'm assuming a PGP base here).   Probably simply to do,
	 but has anybody done it?  No pretense of protection from
	 traffic analysis here: just to keep prying 3rd parties' eyes
	 off it.
