Hal seems to be asking questions which implicitly define
a reputation to be some kind of credential.

This is like *defining* money as fiat money, as governments
are prone to do, or *defining* the value of a good to be its
labor content, as Marx did.

If you assume that the two are the same, then the two will
cease to be the same, the system will screw up, and you will 
need coercion (legal tender laws) to make fiat money work
as if it was actual money, and to make credentials act as 
if they were actual reputations.
