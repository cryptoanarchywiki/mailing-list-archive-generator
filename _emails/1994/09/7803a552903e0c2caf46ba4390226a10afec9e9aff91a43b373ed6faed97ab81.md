| The French company BULL makes a nice encrypting laptop computer, called
| "Sub Rosa", which is used by Canada's Department of national revenue
| auditors. 

	It should be mentioned that when you buy a complete solution
from a company, you need to trust them.  Bull is not entwined with the
government; it is an arm of the government for all intents and
purposes.  The French intelligence agencies have a long history of
economic espionage.

	I am amazed that the Canadian Dept of Revenue would want the
French government to read all its secrets.
