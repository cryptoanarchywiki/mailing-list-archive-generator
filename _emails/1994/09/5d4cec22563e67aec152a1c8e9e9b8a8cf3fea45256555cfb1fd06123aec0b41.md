That "legitimate needs of law enforcement" phrase raises my hackles every
time I see it.  My contrary nature makes me want to shout questions like,
"Just what *are* the legitimate needs of law enforcement?" and, "Who
decides what the legitimate needs of law enforcement are?  Law enforcement
personnel?  Bwahahahah."

A more effective response might be to point out (with sufficient force)
that "we still, as a nation, haven't decided what the legitimate needs of
law enforcement are."  Therefore, anyone, especially someone with a
political power interest in the matter, who asserts we have decided is
attempting to end-run our democracy and usurp power.

This whole business that Freeh keeps peddling, for example, about the
number of wiretaps (oh, excuse me, the number of wiretaps and remote
listening posts and oh so many other kinds of surveillance) to back up his
demands for big brother powers over all of us, well, it begs the
question.
