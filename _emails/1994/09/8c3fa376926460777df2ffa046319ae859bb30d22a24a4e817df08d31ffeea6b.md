Amazing.  Truly amazing.

You could try actually reading what the man's written before dismissing
him on one person's inflamatory rhetoric.  I assure you, what he has to
say is quite interesting, whether you agree with it or not (I don't
always): it's just not worth arguing with someone who claims to know
what Chomsky believes better than Chomsky does.
