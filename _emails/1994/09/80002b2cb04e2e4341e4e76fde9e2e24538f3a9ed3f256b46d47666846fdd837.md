The list is not automatically archived.  Robert Hayden had been keeping a 
"digest" version on his machine.  That was until the university he's at pulled 
the plug for stupid reasons.  Right now, Robert is fighting to get his machine 
back up and running.  Maybe he'd be willing to keep the digest again if the 
machine gets back up.  Until then, anyone have any suggestions?
