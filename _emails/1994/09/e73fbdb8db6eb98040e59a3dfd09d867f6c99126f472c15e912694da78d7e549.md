There was a news report/discussion tonight about birth control -- and
someone advocating that all you need to do is just tell teens to say "no"
to sex before marriage, then you won't need to distribute condoms without
parental permission....

Suddenly it hit me that the same frame of mind was clearly behind the
Clipper Initiative.

Do you think there's a way to test for this ability to believe nonsense?

Do you think there's a way to treat it?
