Hmm .. sounds like a good opportunity to spawn off a pseudonym. 
The Cyphernomicon can stand on its own two feet with respect to 
being useful - it's nice to know that Tim May wrote it, but it'd
be interesting if some nobody did, also. Perhaps the next edition
*should* be (apparently) published by some unknown nobody .. 
Klaus! von Future Prime, or some other fictional character who
doesn't get (or need to reply to) E-mail. Important corrections or
other comments can get sent to the list for general digestion and
discussion.
