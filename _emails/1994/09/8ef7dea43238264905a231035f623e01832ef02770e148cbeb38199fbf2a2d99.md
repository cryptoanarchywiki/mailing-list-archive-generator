You have to excuse Perry.  You see, in Perry's eyes, anyone who doesn't 
agree with him, and has the intestinal fortitude to say so, is called 
names and told they are "insulting" him.  As Tom Clancy says in "Debt of 
Honor", "It was a source of constant surprise to Ryan that important 
grown-ups so often acted like five-year-olds."
