I did, however, get my "Don't give Big Brother a master key" T-shirt
very quickly. Would order from those folks again (sorry, don't have
the address handy, though).

	at crypto I had a half-dozen requests for info regarding
	the big brother inside/1984 shirts. Is another run of these
	possible? I could probably scrape together that many
	orders just here in Msoft, I beleive.
