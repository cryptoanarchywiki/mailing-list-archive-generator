Half a dozen such special sub-list exists on Cypherpunks--bet you
didn't know that, eh? That's because they go unused, for reasons I've
written about before.

And there _are_ money-related lists: IMP-Interest, DigLib, AltInst,
and probably others I've missed. Why start yet another one?

If you're not on _their_ lists, why do you think they'll join _your_ list?

Creating such a list is the easy part (Duncan and Sandy just did it
for PRIVACY 101)..the hard part is having it survive infancy.
