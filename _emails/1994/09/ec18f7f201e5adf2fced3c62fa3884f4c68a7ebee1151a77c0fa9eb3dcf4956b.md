They can build what they like, Tim. The protocols being defined right
now by the IETF do not include provisions for escrow. Thus far, no one
from the NSA, or even TIS, has come up to me and said that I should
change the draft RFCs that I am writing. Any such OS support for SKE
in Microsoft software would not be interoperable with anyone else's
software. Since the bulk of the internet does not run on Microsoft
platforms, and since Microsoft doesn't sell things like routers and
the like, even Microsoft has to interoperate if they want their
packets to move past the local ethernet.
