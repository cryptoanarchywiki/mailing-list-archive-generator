Didn't mean to imply you were: I was just thinking that this is the
first legal manifestation of using the threat of a Horseman against
anonymity on the net, of any sort.

Well, "security holes" is a bit loose of a term;  I was thinking out loud,
as it were.  The concept, as evolved later, is to distribute a set of
features to be added to the RFC-822 protocol that will allow security,
including remailer support (though not stated as such).

This isn't really an STO: it's more the providing a suite of features:
including features that we want along with features that will help spread
the whole set.

Sure.  But that doesn't help the channel between inside the US and 
outside -- IE, the channels that the NSA is chartered to eavesdrop
on (yes, as Eric likes to say: the NSA and the FBI are different.  But
imagine that at some point in the future the NSA, hard pressed to justify
its existence, starts passing data to other agencies).  Right now, there
aren't that many IP channels to outside the country, so they're pretty
easy to tap.

That thought crossed my mind, too, but since we aren't talking about any
illegal activities, merely protocols that might facilitate the same while
also facilitating privacy, I think we're fine.  Of course, given the
stretches made by Law Enforcement for civil forfeitures, the E911
Neidorf thing, and others, perhaps it's time to start seriously
looking at hacking list software to create mailing lists that are fully
anonymous and encrypted.  Has anybody started on such a project?
