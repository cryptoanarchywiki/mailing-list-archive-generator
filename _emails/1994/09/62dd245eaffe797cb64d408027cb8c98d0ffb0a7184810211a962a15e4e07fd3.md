Responding to msg by Mike Markley:

What about being denied a job because you have been 
treated for some disease? How about being denied a loan 
because your medical history has a profile that 
indicates that your life expectancy is shorter than the 
duration of the loan? It seems that the potential for 
abuse is so great that we should not allow such cross 
referencing.

Hey, Mike, just remember in the real world no one is required 
to be kind.  If some hospital or company makes a decision to 
deny service for whatever reason they justify to themselves, 
it's their call as long as they are not owned by the State.  
They would likely make the same decisions upon receiving any 
information which represented a potential loss of revenue, 
whether that information came from special history files or 
from a client's personal admission.  Even though having 
information about oneself passed around among agencies is 
odious to contemplate, what a private company decides to do as 
a consequence of their information is not really 'abuse'.  (How 
they get that information in the first place, however, could 
be.)
