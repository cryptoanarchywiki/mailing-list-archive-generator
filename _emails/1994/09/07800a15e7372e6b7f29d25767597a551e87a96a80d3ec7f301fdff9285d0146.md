Only ment as an example... ...not as an accuatual pratice. I agree that a 
company that praticed thoes polices would not make it far. The Minority 
is enough to pull a company down on there own. The Minority has friends 
that are not minority. Enough to quickly bankrupt the comany. Hiring 
pratices based on things other then the quality of work produced is 
another thing. 

Groove on dude
