An enlightened view like this is never off topic where nuclear 
weapons and molten spray in tank hulls are chatted up with 
relish.  State-mandated homicide gotta have its dehumanized 
professionals to do the dirty work.

And your suggestion of giving kids the vote at an earlier age 
adds sane countervalence to the

     parent /
     teacher /
     caseworker /
     cop /
     prison guard /
     executioner

escape from responsibility algorithm.
