   I might be up for it but...  I would like to do the same in San Diego
and then have a representative of the LA group meet the San Diego group
representatives  to sign some keys.  It would be kind of nice to have a
group of trusted  cypherpunk members from each city to act as kind of
the "CA" allowing you to eventually have some trusted keys from MIT and
others that distribute software.  I guess it would be a semi formal way
to build a trusted  hierarchy across the country.

   Next step would to have cypherpunk-sponsord pub-key-servers to hold
these keys.  I don't want it to sound too "clubish".  I've just never
personally met any of the cypherpunks and therefore have very few
trusted keys since I can't trust any of the sigs..  Ya gotta start
somewhere.

   I would be interested in seeing one in San Diego to key sign and
discuss things like this, GAK, and others.  What do you think?

 - --------------
P.S.  Will be out on "special mission" from 1/16 until 10/10.  When I
return I would like to help make this happen.

   If you are interested and could attend in SD, send me e-mail and I
will start creating a list.  Make the SUBJECT= "SD CYPHERPUNKS".
