This true conclusion is based on a true assumption that Sandy does
not explicitly make, indeed implicitly denies.

That there is a strong correlation between one wrongful behavior - murder
for hire, and other wrongful behavior - dishonoring promises.

Murder for hire will work if there are honorable, well respected
murder for hire escrow agencies with a long and well established
reputation and murder for hire hitmen with a long and well
established reputation.

Neither seems likely, especially the second.
