When Sendmail gets a mail to an unknown user (e.g. nobody@grunt.com),
it will reject the mail. The relaying mailer is then supposed to bounce the
mail back to the author.

So if we forge the From: line, the mail should bounce back to the bogus
target. If I forge a mail as follows:
 From: cypherpunks@toad.com
 To: nobody_at_all@bb.com
 ------blah blah blah-----

It should bounce and thus appear on the cypherpunks list, without a sender.
Of course, it will have paths, etc, which give the game away. What is 
needed to give 'Stealth' remailing is a mailer that when seeing a header
such as 'X-Bounce-Strip: 1' removes headers and sends body text only back.
This is a useful feature to reduce network bandwidth when bouncing mail,
and should be included in all sendmails (grin).
