hi ray.

can ya do me a favor?

Tell the fine folks on Cypher Punks that I will be handing out disks at 
UNIX expo, I have 100 3.5" 1.44 mb floppies and a ready to compile 
version of PGP- Plus a copy of the cypto articles you gave me last time. 

If anyone has ready to run (i.e. pkgadd, or tar -xvf pgp ) versions of PGP 
for SUN, SCO AIX, linux or some other UNIX drop me a line. I hope to
have both source and ready to run disks. (And some PC disks as well)

If you live in the NYC area, and want to go to UNIX-Expo for free (I have
two extra passes, First come First Served) or just want to help- send
mail to sal@panix.com
