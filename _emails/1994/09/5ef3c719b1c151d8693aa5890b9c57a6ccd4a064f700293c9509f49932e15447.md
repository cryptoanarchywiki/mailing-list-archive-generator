I finally got around to calling the number that was posted along with the 
announcement of Williams and Macias' bumper sticker printer stock of a few 
weeks ago.  They were quite willing to send me samples of it :-)  When it 
shows up, I'll take it for a 'test drive' and let you all know how it turns 
out.

Their number is 1-800-310-0890, if you want to play with it yourself.
