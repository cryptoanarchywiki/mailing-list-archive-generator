Take Pr0duct Cypher, for example. Many believe that what (s)he's doing(*) is 
a Good Thing, and I've seen him/her using the Cypherpunk remailers to 
conceal his/her identity.

* If you don't know, (s)he's the person who wrote PGPTOOLS, and a hack for 
PGP 2.3a to decrypt messages written with 2.6. I assume (s)he's doing it 
anonymously due to ITAR regulations.

There is no such thing as limited censorship. If you want your freedom, 
fight now. Don't wait until you've lost it.
