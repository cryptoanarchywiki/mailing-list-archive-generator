In case any of you had filtered this one out based purely
on sender and subject, I've enclosed the *headers* of the message and
its first paragraph.

The message also contained two source files, "rc4.h" and "rc4.c",
implementing a stream cypher which is based on incremental shuffling
of a permutation of the numbers 0..255, and seems to be fairly
well-suited for efficient implementation in software.  For obvious
reasons, I'm not including the source files here.

    I've tested this.  It is compatible with the RC4 object module
    that comes in the various RSA toolkits.
