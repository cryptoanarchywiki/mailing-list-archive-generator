Nope.  The ability to take fast modular factorials as you suggest
implies the ability to factor large numbers in polynomial time.

If (n!)mod x = 0 then there is a factor of x which is less than n.  If
you can solve modular factorials, then you can solve for the largest
factor of x in logarithmic time.  Obviously, nobody has found a method
to do either.
