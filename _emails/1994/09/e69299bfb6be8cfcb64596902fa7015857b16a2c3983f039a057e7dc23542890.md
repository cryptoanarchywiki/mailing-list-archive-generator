In the above scenario, I would never use my voice over the digital cellular
[and I would be always moving {nothing done at home}]...strictly PGP/E-Mail.
Even IF the parties are known, can they make their case? [How can they prove
X sent Y if using PGP and anonymous remailers?] Of course, if one of them
cooperates, that's different.

Can Tempest be used as I'm driving/on a city bus? How expensive is it to
maintain a Tempest surveillance in this fashion? This is a positive of
portable computers and portable communications..no one can pinpoint [even
remotely] where I'll compose/collect my pgp/e-mail. I am assuming that I'm
covering my tracks smartly, and the only thing they have is what they can
grab over the air, which is PGP, and that gets sent to some BBS [which they
don't know] for my friend to pick up.

The ESNs and the Keep Moving are really helpful, thanks.
