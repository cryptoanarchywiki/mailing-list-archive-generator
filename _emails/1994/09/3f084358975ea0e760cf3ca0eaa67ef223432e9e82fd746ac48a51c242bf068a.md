You're right about the mountainous areas being fairly easy to guerrilla
from; ditto the *major* urban areas due to their population densities.
We've got borders that couldn't be effectively closed - and held that way -
without an expenditure that would surely break any government over the long
run.  Relatively minor urban areas (say, under half-million population)
would be fairly easily monitored and controlled.

Communications would be a pure bitch without some kind of web-of-trust
similar to PGP's. Ditto personnel or other underground transfers.  The first
few years of the movement would see incredible caualties, either by way of
death or captures, until the participants learned that it was "for-real".

Acts of violence and sabotage would be sparse at first, because that kind of
knowledge isn't particularly needed or wanted these days. In a large
country, and as large as such a government would have to be, simple physical
sabotage and destruction wouldn't cut it. There would *have* to be people
working on the command/control/communications side, logistics, etc, as well:
getting some phreak to go in an turn the local Baby Bell substation's
circuit into a pretzel, for example; or hacking an order for supplies so as
to leave out something important, but not *critical*, so as to
irritate/demoralize.

As many miles of train track as we have in this country, and considering how
much of our food and raw materials still travel by rail, it wouldn't be
terribly difficult to randomly de-spike some of the rail and wait for a
train to catch it wrong - particularly on a curve.

Killing of low- and mid-level government officials (the upper level ones
would have some degree of security/protection) would become a new "sport" -
one has to wonder how many folks would be willing to be tax collectors if
the survival rate for them was, say, 6 months. If the military got dragged
in to helping the government (almost a necessity) it wouldn't take long
before Billy Bob from Lubbock caught on that the same kind of harm he was
causing Mrs. O'leary in Chicago was probably happening to *his* momma by
someone from Seattle.

As noted, propaganda/PR would become *very* important - I doubt such a
government could maintain any kind of pretense that things weren't going
wrong for them. Key though, would have to be honesty on the part of the
revolutionists - they wouldn't be likely to win friends and influence
enemies if they lied as badly, and often, as such a government would have to.

Other skills/occupations that I've thought of that would help would be
things like engineers (who would know better how to take down a bridge than
a civil engineer?), burglar alarm folks (obvious reasons), and so on - in
short, the kinds of folks that have to deal with abstract concepts in a
creative way.  Most valuable of all would be the folks that had as much
diverse theoretical knowledge as possible, with practical experience to
temper it.  Someone with military experience and knowledge of computer
systems, crypto, electricity/electronics, mechanical/civil engineering,
chemistry (at least, "practical" kind, like home-brew ordnance), military
tactics and strategy, logistics, communications, planning and organization,
medicine (say, knowing how much Jimson weed juice to add to a 5-gallon
coffee urn to make a guard force bonkers), and of course, a healthy dose of
suspicion/paranoia. Someone with all these attributes, plus a taste for
action/adventure/war/crime stories and a good memory for their details,
would likely be worth his/her weight in C-4.
