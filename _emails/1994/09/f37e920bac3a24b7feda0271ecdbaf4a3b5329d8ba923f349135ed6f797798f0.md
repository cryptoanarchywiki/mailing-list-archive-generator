I have a hard time comparing any of these histricaly 
important but comparatively minor events to the half a 
million dead of the Civil War or the 50,000+ dead of 
Vietnam. Perhaps you have extended the  analogy a 
little too far?...

I think he was talking about the Principle of the deal, Jim -  
about what this means regarding the relationship of the 
citizenry to the big G.
Put all of those insurrections together and what do they spell?
