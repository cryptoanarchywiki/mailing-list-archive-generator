Lets say a place wont hire blacks, and you happend to be black, and 
wanted to work for such a company. Would you do what you can to hide your 
color, if possible, to get hired, then let them try to fire you over it, 
or would you decide that you wouldnt want to work for this company at 
all? What if MOST companys had this policy... ...and the ones that didnt, 
wouldnt pay anyone what they are worth. What then?

If one or two companys would be the ones deciding what to do based on 
this information then I wouldnt see much problem in it, I would choose to 
do buisness with other companys based on there ethic, however I dont 
think many companys that I will do buisness with are the likes that wont 
use anything they can get there hands on. Assuming this to be true, it 
could be very difficult to live if every company knew I was such and 
such.
