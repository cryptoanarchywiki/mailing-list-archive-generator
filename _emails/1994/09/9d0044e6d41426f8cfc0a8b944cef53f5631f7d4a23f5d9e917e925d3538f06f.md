This is not the same Black Unicorn we knew last spring.  Has someone
hijacked his account?   Regardless of whether you agreed with his
points, Unicorn always "spoke" eloquently and carefully, and with a
distinctive style that has not been present in the posts emanating
from this account in the last week or two.  Uni's reputation is being
rapidly squandered.  Could this be Detweiler's revenge?
