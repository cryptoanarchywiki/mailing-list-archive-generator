I was just wondering if something like a random number workbench exists?
I am looking for some implimentations of randomness tests that I can run on the
output of pseudo-random and random number generators that I am working on.
Is there a ftp site where I can get something of this sort? If not, what sort of
demand would there be for one if I were to write it?
