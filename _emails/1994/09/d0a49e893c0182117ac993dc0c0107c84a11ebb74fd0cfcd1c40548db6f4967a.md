I think the distinction between "reputation" and "credential" is an
important one in this context.
I would be interested in discussing "the interesting issue of what the role
of cryptography will be in establishing <credentials> in a
possibly-pseudonymous business network", i.e. TRW credit reports, drivers
licenses, or ATM cards (all of which may or may not be tied to a reputation
or to a valuable, wonderful person - doesn't matter to me. Will I get my
money outta the deal?).
