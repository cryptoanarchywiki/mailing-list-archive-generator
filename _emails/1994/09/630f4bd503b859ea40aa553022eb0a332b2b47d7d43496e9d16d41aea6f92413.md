I've put two versions of the FAQ up in compressed forms, labelled
"compressed" and "gzipped" (with the .Z and .z suffixes). These can be
handled in the normal way, with "uncompress" (at your end) and
"gunzip" at your end (I'm not sure the trick of forcing the gunzip at
my end will work, with the chmod bits I set...that's a reason I left
it in uncompressed form).

I'm doing this because someone said their VAX won't take files bigger
than 1 MB. This may help, as the compressed files are around 450K
each.

But please don't ask me for other versions. In particular, I can't
help the CompuServe users, etc.
