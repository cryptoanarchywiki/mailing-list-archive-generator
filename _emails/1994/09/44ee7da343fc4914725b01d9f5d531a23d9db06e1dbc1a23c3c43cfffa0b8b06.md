 There was an interesting piece on a new AIDs self-test kit this
morning that focused on privacy.

 The idea is that an AIDs self-test kit is made widely available
via your local pharmacy. You use the kit's materials to draw a drop
of blood, which you place on an enclosed test slide.

 You then seal the slide, attach a barcoded sticker, and mail in
the enclosed mailer to a lab.

 After a few weeks, you call a 1-800 number, punch in your code
(from the sticker) and you get a recording telling you if the test
was negative.

 From this point on the piece (CBS this morning) was elaborating on
whether or not a machine should be used to pass on this news, or
should a "real" person be involved.

Interesting...
