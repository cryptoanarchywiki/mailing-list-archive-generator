We don't have to imagine fatal illnesses spread by casual
contact. We've had plenty of experience with such diseases even into
this century -- polio, tuberculosis, and the like -- and government
did a lousy job with them. I'm not sure market based mechanisms would
necessarily do extremely well, but I do know that the alternatives
aren't so amazing as to make me pine for them.
