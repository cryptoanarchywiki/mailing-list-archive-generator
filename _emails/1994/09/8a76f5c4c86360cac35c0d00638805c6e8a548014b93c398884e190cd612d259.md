So, what gives you the right to stick your nose into other peoples
business practices.  I believe that if I hire a person to do some
task it should be my decision as to what sort of person I hire as
it is my money that I am paying them and my business that suffers
if I am forced into hiring someone based on something other than
good business reasons.

The same could be said about the Democratic Party in the USA.

I think that it would be a Healthy Change instead of the crap
that you seem to perfer.
