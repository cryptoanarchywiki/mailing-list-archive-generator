Responding to msg by Jim choate:

As to putting them all together, you do a diservice in 
my eyes. They did  not occur together and they 
certainly did not occur in the same social  milieu that 
the Civil War or the Vietnam War - Civil Disobedience 
did.  There were national events that effected every 
person. The events that  you refer to were local events 
that eventually effected every person  on a national 
scale. Slightly different animals.
.............................................................

Do you mean that a Majority Happening is the only thing which 
is important in your eyes?  That the individual is 
insignificant when s/he is affected by legislation on a 
personal basis?   That if only one person feels discomfitted by 
it then it's no big deal because no one else has realized that 
they've been violated?  That life, liberty & the pursuit of 
happiness is only important when carried out by large groups?  
That the standard of Good Government is a National Event rather 
than the quality of individual existence?  That a Rose by any 
other name or any lesser multiplicand is not a rose?
