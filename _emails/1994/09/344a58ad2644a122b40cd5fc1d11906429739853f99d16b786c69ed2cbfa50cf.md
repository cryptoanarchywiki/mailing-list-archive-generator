The 4.4 telnet is NOT identical. Its much better code, has lots of
neat new capabilities that you probably want, is more modular, and the
versions I saw had hooks for D-H and the like, which is where most of
the work is -- you can get the D-H code from RSAREF and steal the IDEA
code from PGP; from there the changes are small. And yes, I assumed
that you didn't have an encrypted telnet at all. It would not have
been a stupid assumption to make because this request occurs on
Cypherpunks at four month intervals.
