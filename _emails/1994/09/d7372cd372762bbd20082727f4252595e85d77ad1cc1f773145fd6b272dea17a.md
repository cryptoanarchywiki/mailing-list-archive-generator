You don't need any Testbed Administration to do that. You can start such
a mailing list right now, based on "silly name" NetCash/NetBank. They
have the advantage of being right here, right now, and they are real money
(so far :-).

The fact that they receive their funds only through 900 numbers does not
even necessarily limit them to USA residents: others can easily buy and
sell "credits" through said USA residents.  After all, people have been
selling software and T-shirts internationally for a while.

AMIX was based on such a system, albeit somehow considering they didn't
need internet access, and building a pricing schedule more in line with
Dialog than with internet (read "out of this world" :-).
