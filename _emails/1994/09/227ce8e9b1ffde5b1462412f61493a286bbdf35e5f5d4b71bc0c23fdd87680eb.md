Uh, I was paraphrasing the conclusions of the article in
order to convey that the authors clearly have no clue about
security software. I (incorrectly) thought there was sufficient
sarcasm in my post to convey that.

Question - where did the below-highlighted opinion come from?

Also, I do disagree with your statement "security through
obscurity is no security at all." A rather high degree of
security can be had through obscurity, but it is often entirely
unpredictable whether or not a particlar 'obscurity method'
will be secure or not (any 15 year old hiding cigarettes under
the bed can attest to that). I see this as an extension of the
pricipals underlying modern crypto - it could be that a factoring
attack on RSA is possible but really obscure. It is simply an
example of more predictable security through obscurity. Perhaps
I'm pushing definitions a little too far here.
