A person has certain inalienable rights. The rights of teh majority in this
country are DEFINED by the Constitution. If the right or responsibility is not
SPECIFICALY detailed in that document  then the  Federal govt. does not have
that right, unless it is added as an amendment by the states. I oppose any
move by the majority to remove a possible action or belief system from the
individual that does not directly lead to the damage of a person or their 
property without their prior consent.

Is that clear enough as to what I believe? Behind this view is an avowed 
Pantheist.

As to the rose, call  it whatever is convenient...

Take care.
