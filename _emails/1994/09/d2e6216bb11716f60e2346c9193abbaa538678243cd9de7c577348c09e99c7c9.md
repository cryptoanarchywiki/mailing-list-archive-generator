The problem is, if you are using an interface to PGP, most of the time  
they use PGP in batchmode to check the signature, and they don't let you  
see the output. This means people go "Check the signature", PGP says "Good  
signature found", and they think that it has never been modified. This is  
a security hole. Not everyone uses PGP to do everything from the command  
line. Plus, using lines with only a tab in them, it's possible to add  
seperated paragraphs and "normal-looking" text.

Here's an example:

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
	
Note that this paragraph was added *AFTER* this message was digitally  
signed.
Note also that the line above this paragraph contains *1* tab. Using this,  
it's possible to add as much stuff to the beginning of a clearsigned  
message as you want, with it looking completely natural, and checking  
fine. This *IS* a security hole.
	
This para was also added later.
