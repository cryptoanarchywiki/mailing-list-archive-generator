Perhaps not.  The US user could send an encrypted message to a foreign
machine that offers, say, 100 different services, including a remailing
service.  You could not prove that the sender had requested a remailing
and thus he could not be prosecuted.  You could even randomly invoke one
of the other services whenever a remail is requested.   Other services 
might include ftpmail, archie searches etc...
