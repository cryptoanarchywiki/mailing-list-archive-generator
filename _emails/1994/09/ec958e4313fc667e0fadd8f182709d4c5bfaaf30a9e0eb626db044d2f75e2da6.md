Duncan Frissell and Dave Emery have commented on the popular notion
that all codes and ciphers will "eventually" be broken.

On the other hand, Bamford pointed out in 1982 (in "The Puzzle
Palace") that no significant Soviet cipher had been broken _directly_
for at least a decade, as near as he and other experts could tell
(there are clearly uncertainties in what the NSA was able to do, but
this wa Bamford's best estimate).

Ditto for the Soviets not having broken U.S. ciphers in at least as
long a time.

What code and cipher breaking had occurred had generally happened
through HUMINT sources, as with the Walker spy ring (which sold old
code books, allowing earlier traffic to be reconstructed). Black bag
jobs, bugging of buildings, etc. And I have no idea what crypto
material Aldrich Ames transferred.

I agree. Even Tom Clancy mythologizes crypto and usually gets it wrong.

Exactly.

In fact, at the last physical Cypherpunks meeting I arrived a few
minutes late, in the midst of a debate about whether noise sources
from audio inputs were "random enough" to defy cryptanalysis by the
NSA.

After listening for a while I had to speak up: In the history of
modern cryptanalysis is there _any_ evidence that a single message has
been broken because of something like this?

I speculated that any slight reductions of entropy, thus allowing
slight increases in the ability to predict the bits, are dwarfed by
many orders of magnitude by more practical concerns. For example, the
proliferation of keystroke capture utilities which capture and store
all keystrokes entered for later retrieval.

(I acknowledge the importance of high entropy noise sources, I just
question the nit-picking about it when such much more tractable
attacks exist.)
