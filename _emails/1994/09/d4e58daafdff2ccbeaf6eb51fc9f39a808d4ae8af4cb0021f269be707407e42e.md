Since we're on the subject of T-shirts, does anyone have any X-large or 
XX-large T-shirts with the "1984, We're a little behind Schedule!" logo on 
them? If someone is ever going to do another run of them I would be interested 
in buying one or two of them. The "Big Brother Inside" on the front and the 
"1984" logo on the back would be an ideal shirt! Anyway, if anybody knows 
where I could purchase such a shirt please contact me at the below address. 
Thanks.
