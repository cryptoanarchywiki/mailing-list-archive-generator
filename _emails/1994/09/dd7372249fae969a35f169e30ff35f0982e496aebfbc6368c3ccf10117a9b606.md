Hmm.  Unfortunately I think we're missing the point here.  Perhaps a
redefinition of SUFFERANCE REMAILERS...  A SUFFERANCE REMAILER is remailer
which exists only so long as *any* government, organization, person(s) does
not decide (for whatever reasons) to shut it down, outlaw it, etc.

Firstly, a remailer which is not directly vunerable to the U.S.'s "gun
argument" may still be vunerable to any other country's gun argument;
information is power, and no State may be trusted to act in our best
interest insofar as information and communication are concerned.

Secondly, sing the *placement* of a remailer in a recalcitrant country as
the only means of defense against U.S. legislation will pretty much insure
that the remailer's general location will, sooner or later, become a
military target; whereas the remailer's location makes it *indirectly*
vunerable to the U.S.'s "gun argument," the very fact that it is accessible
by U.S. citizens makes it *directly* vunerable to the U.S. military
machine.  (Again, this is using on placement as a means of defense against
any U.S. legislation.)

And this brings up point C...

It would not only be necessary to legislate against remailers, but would be
necessary to legislate against *access* to remailers.  This is what I
imagine would happen.

Umpteen is spelled with an 'h.'  ;)
