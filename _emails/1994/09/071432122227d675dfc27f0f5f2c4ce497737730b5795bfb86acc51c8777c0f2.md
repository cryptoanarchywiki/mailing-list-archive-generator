I was one of the people who suffered from the anon.penet.fi attack which
allocated IDs to so many members of this list. I immediately sent a message
to admin@anon.penet.fi asking to have the message removed. I just received
the reply below. I am not familiar with this person. Does this person speak
for Julf? Is the snakemail.hut.fi site associated with the anon.penet.fi
site?
Thanks for all help.
