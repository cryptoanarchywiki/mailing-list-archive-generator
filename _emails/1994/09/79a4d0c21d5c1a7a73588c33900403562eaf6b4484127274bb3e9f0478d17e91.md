And there will always be such a value for m equal to kx where k is an
integer less than n/x
If x is non-prime, there may be factors f and g such that f*g=x.  In
that case, if n>f and n>g then n=0, hence finding the smallest value of
n such that (n!)mod x =0, will yeild a factor of x.  In that case,
dividing by x would remove the factors f and g, yeilding a zero
remainder.

Yes, but if x is not prime, and x>n, (n!)mod x will not necessarily be
zero, unless x>n>x/2


A few examples:

mod 7:
 n   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
 n!  1  2  6  3  1  6  0  0  0  0

mod 15:
 n   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
 n!  1  2  6  9  0  0  0  0  0  0


Note that for mod 15, n=>5 produces only zeros, revealing the factor 5.
