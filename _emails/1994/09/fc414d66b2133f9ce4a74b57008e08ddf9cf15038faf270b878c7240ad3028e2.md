Hi,

I built crypt awhile back.  I'm pretty sure I got the source from
ghost.dsi.unimi.it.  Now that site says everything has been moved to
ftp.dsi.unimi.it, but there seems to be no crypt.c there, although there
is plenty of other crypt stuff.  In the meantime, I was cleaning up (big
mistake), and lost my copy of the source.

Can someone tell me where the source is for the crypt program?  I'd like
to build it for my Linux system.

ps I promise not to export it.

thanks,
tw
