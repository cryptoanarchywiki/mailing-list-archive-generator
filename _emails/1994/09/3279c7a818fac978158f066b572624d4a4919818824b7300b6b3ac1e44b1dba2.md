At 102 feet? ... it's just from a long-ago PADI training and a couple
of shallow dives following, but from what I remember:

	- the rule of thumb is that 30 feet of water get you an	
		atmosphere.  So you're at 102 you're at just under
		4.5, so you're using air at the rate of 4.5 times
		the rate you do on the surface.

	- My dives were usually 30-60 feet (say, half the pressure the
		H.E.A.T. team dealt with), and I was able to stay
		down for over an hour, with one tank.  That means
		that with two tanks they should have had at least a
		similar	limit, say an hour.  On the other hand, I
		wasn't wrestling... Exertion can pull you way down.
		If they were giving a definite, solid time limit, it's
		definitely bogus ("Let's see, five minutes at 10 times
		air consumption while you fight...") for air limitations.

	- However, I also remember that at 102 feet you're beginning
		to push the envelope on what you can do with normal
		80% Nitrogen mix;  Nitrogen narcosis starts to become
		a real possibility.

So, it's vaguely plausible if they didn't have any warning and couldn't
get any special gas mixes for their air.  Otherwise, I don't buy it.
