Well you can do it this way by using a mail to news gateway, as for
tracibility, this is quite tracible.  Remember all you have to do is have
a log of all incoming telnet sessions and a log at the home machine of all
out going telnet sessions and you're easily paired up with it.

That's one of the ways, some stupid fool got caught mailing a death threat
to the president using forged mail from 'never.gonna.catch.me.org'
