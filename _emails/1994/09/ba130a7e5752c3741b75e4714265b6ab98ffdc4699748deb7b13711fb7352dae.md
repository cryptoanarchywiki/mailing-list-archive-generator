C'punks,

How exciting!  My first anti-fan, Rishab Aiyer Ghosh wrote:

    Sandy's H.E.A.T was hard enough on my poor 'D' key; I
    hope ...  yada, yada, yada ...

While I agree that "Beach Clash" *is* too far afield (sorry,
David), I have a serious and a *seemingly* not-so-serious
reason for "reviewing" Acapulco H.E.A.T.

MY SERIOUS REASON--The world does not see cryptography and
related privacy technologies as do the Cypherpunks.  Most folks
"learn" about crypto from popular culture (e.g., TV and movies)
and, to a lesser extent, the popular press.  When we try to
persuade others to support strong crypto, we have to know what
*they* know (and don't know), if we are to be effective.

MY REAL REASON--Cypherpunks is not just a mailing list.  It is a
wired community of people with strong, commonly held beliefs
concerning privacy.  The problem is, the intensity of our beliefs
and the ultimate seriousness of what's at stake, can lead to a
negative, siege mentality.  I believe there is a place, in every
community of fellow travelers, for humor and humanity.  That's
one of the reasons that physical meeting are so important.  If
you've been to one, you know that it isn't all strategy and
tactics; there is also fellowship.  After a Cypherpunks meeting,
many attendees go out for dinner together.  In California, we
even--god forbid--"bond."  (Not valid in Arizona, Kansas,
Kentucky or where prohibited by law.  Your mileage may differ.
If pain persists, consult a physician.)

Acapulco H.E.A.T., with dubious crypto and suspect technology,
has become an inside joke for Cypherpunks.  When we watch it, we
see things the average person misses.  This is something we
share, and something that helps create the lighter side of
Cypherpunk culture.


 S a n d y

P.S.  I'm serious.
