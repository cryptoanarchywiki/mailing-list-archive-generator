I am a novice, but in discussing some of the issues, i.e.; wiretap bill 
with my dad, Col (ret) from the Green Berets, he said we would have to 
return to short wave, if this happens.  Imangine pgp shortwave!  Of 
course, they would have to be mobile to evade trangulation or satellite 
pin pointing of transmission, which isn't yet available, will be some 
day. Some advice from a guerilla warfare fighter...
