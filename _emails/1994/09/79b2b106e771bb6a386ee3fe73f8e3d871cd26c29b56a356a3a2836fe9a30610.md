Hmmm...  I requested my key from the MIT key-server and it came back with two
unknown signatures.  So I requested those two keys, only to find that they
were Bill Clinton and Al Gore.  I've never met either of them (although I
have seen Al Gore jogging through Rock Creek Park).

Those keys had signatures also, so I got the signator's key as well, only to
find that it was "Hillary's" key.
