[Disclaimer: this is what I gather, from looking at a competitor's
 setup.]

A subset of what you want exists: the Internet Bookstore (I believe it's
 called) has a viewer/dongle combination for customers that they ship to
 customers for (I think) $30.  I have no idea whether they've sold any,
 but I'd bet not (given the low level of sales Bibliobytes has seen
 without requiring $30 up front).

Their design presumably puts the user's key in the dongle; each book
 shipped is encrypted with it, so the books are (I think) tied to the
 dongle.

However, AFAIK there's no time-binding invovled, and I'm skeptical as
 to how easy that would be: once you've displayed information once, it's
 out.
