Exactly so.

1. They have not been voted in - they are a junior partner
   in a multi party coalition. 

2. They are a mere political party - no longer a powerful, 
   attractive, and superficially plausible ideology.

Read before flaming:  I am quite aware that the fascists were a 
political movement, not a military coup.

My point was exactly that.  That though a military coup is possible,
the ideology that made that political movement possible is dead,
dead, dead, dead.

Get it.


Dead.

Fascism was an idea.  That idea has been proven false.

The end.
