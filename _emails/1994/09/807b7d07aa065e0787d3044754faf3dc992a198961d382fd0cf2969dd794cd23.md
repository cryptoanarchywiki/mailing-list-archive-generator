While I agree that remailers could eventually, if not already deter the 
local cops, and perhaps even federal enforcement, my point was more 
design goal, not current capability.  This distinction is likely to be 
lost in any court proceedings, or in any FISA proceeding.  Again, it 
means nothing that remailers do or do not have the capability to deter 
this or that kind of attacker, but that they are not intentionally 
crippled to allow government circumvention.

If I use a scanner to listen to police activity while committing a crime, 
and such an offense is an obstruction charge in my jurisdiction, does it 
matter that I was a moron and that I had it tuned to the wrong channel, 
and was caught?

What if the scanner was too primitive to deal with the new 800 MHZ police 
band?  Am I still guilty?  What if I was using it to listen to the 
weather forecast so the stolen flour wouldn't be rained on?

Isn't it obvious that the judge will take a dim view of ALL these examples?

In this context isn't it important to examine these possibilities as if 
they are a threat with an eye toward addressing them and making remailers 
immune to this type of argument?

Why thank you Mr. Hughes!  :)
