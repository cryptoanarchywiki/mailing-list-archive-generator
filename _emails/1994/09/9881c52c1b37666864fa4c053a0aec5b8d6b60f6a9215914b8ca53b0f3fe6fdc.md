If it displays on my current screen and PC, I can capture it with some
other software.  William Gibson's book "Agrippa" was tried this way (sort
of) and it didn't take long for it to get captured and posted.

If it uses some special-purpose hardware, it'll need to compete with existing
services: cable, rental laserdisks, and so on, and then I'll decide whether
to trade in my current computer and buy it.  I don't see the niche so far.
