Once again (and hopefully for the last time!), I reiterate that it is the
person *placing* the contract who is at zero risk (except for the risk of
losing their digital cash).  Stings can be set up to catch the killer, but
providing the person doing the hiring trusts no one but himself, there is
no risk to him.  To the extent that there is *any* risk to this person, the
goals of crypto anarchy have not been met.  This pertains to every
conceivable security leak that might affect the person placing the
contract.
