Funny that you should bring this up while being lauded for providing
reliability information. My own "ping test" of the "Cypherpunk Criminal"
T-shirts resulted in 100% failure; e.g., no shirts yet and we must be
approaching a 2-digit number of months since I ordered. The seller said
that mine were in the last batch of funny-size shirts that got somehow
screwed up; a few months ago they were to be reprinted and then in the
mail within 2 weeks. Sigh. 

They sounded like a nice idea; perhaps someday I'll make it down to CA
for a real CP meeting and I'll get to see one myself.

I did, however, get my "Don't give Big Brother a master key" T-shirt
very quickly. Would order from those folks again (sorry, don't have
the address handy, though).
