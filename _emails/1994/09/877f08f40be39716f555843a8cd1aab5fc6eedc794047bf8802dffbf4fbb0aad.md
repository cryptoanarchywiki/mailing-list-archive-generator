Probably. But perhaps not for private citizens, but for police, bank, 
government interaction. Since they opened the borders between the
countries they really have a problem. In some towns near to France
they have robberies, where the robbers just walk 300 meters to France
and can't be caught neither by german nor by french police.

At the moment we have a some criminal nazis. (we already had the discussion).
They use BBS, Fax and cryptosoftware for their national and international 
communication. In Italy they have islands with more fax-machines than humans.
Could be reason enough for prohibition.

It _is_ a huge force. But often more ill than good. :-(

They have taken the germans their pretty large, well-tasting and cheap
bananas and given them ugly, dark-brown, tiny, expensive ones.
Perhaps they will do the same with cryptography. :-{

Smile. As long as the US keep their policy, we have a better market. 
I like the US policy. :-D
