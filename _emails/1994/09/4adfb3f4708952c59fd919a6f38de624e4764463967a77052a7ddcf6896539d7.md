Today's NY Times has front page article and editorial on a 
congressional study to be done
on the need for the CIA and reassessment of eleven other 
intelligence agencies.

Says funds for the study were included in recent $28 billlion 
package for intelligence.

One excerpt:

"Throughout the cold war, the nation needed a great 
intelligence service, and by and
large, it got one," said Allen Goodman, a former CIA official 
and dean of the School
of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.  "But from about 
1985 onward nobody's
been able to say if they are good or bad, and from 1990 onward 
nobody's been able
to say exactly why we need them."

End excerpt.

Bet many "national threats" are in the offing.

Email available for the NYT-impaired.
