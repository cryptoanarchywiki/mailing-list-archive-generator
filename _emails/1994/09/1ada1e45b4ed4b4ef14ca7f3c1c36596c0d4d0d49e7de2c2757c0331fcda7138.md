Howdy guys 'n gals.

As much as I'd love to rant about Detweiler getting an account on Colorado
Supernet, I must put aside my insidious remarks for the time being.

Does anyone know, on the off-chance, who is currently working on 
HTTP authentication processes for web browsing and Mosiac?

Pointers appreciated.
