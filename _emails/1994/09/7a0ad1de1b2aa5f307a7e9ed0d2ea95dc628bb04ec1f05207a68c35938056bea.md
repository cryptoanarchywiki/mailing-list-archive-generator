	Are there papers out there on reputation capital that I should
be familiar with before talking about it?  I have a bunch of ideas,
but would like to review the lit before presenting any of them, so I
don't repeat things that have been talked about, and don't make any
dumb mistakes.  I checked the index of AC, and also looked in the
bibliography under Chaum but did not see anything.

	Can anyone provide useful pointers?

Adam
