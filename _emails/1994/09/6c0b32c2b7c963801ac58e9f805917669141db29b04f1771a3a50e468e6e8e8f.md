This seems to conflate three separate issues:

1) being required to identify yourself (e.g., give a name and/or address
and/or date-of-birth)

2) being required to "prove" your identity by producing some sort of
credential

3) being required to have a valid drivers' license in your possession
while driving

Hopefully, we will be able to use cryptographic techniques to prevent
(3) from being permanently associated with (1) and (2). I'm inclined
to eliminate pre-testing and certification for drivers - cops who 
suspect that a certain person shouldn't be driving could administer 
some sort of (probably "VR" [ack, buzzwords!]) "road test" on the
spot - people who pass are OK, and people who fail - because they're
too young, too old, too drunk, too stupid, or too sleepy get punished
for driving while incompetent.
