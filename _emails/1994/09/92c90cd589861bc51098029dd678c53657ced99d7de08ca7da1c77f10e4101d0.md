As a parallel to your inquiry I offer:

Thanks to help from this list my firm uses PGP to encrypt, sign 
and verify CAD architectural documents exchanged with 
consultants and clients.

We also conceal ID in the documents by a simple steganographic 
method using combined PGP and CAD posted here a few weeks back, 
which is not revealed to the recipients, as a check on 
authorized use and distribution.

Any suggested improvements would be welcome.

John
