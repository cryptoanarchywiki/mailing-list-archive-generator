 Boy, doesn't this just give you a warm and fuzzy feeling?

 "Sorry I couldn't attend your conference Dorothy, I was busy doing
my cryptography homework."

 On the subject of remailers, I just had a thought. What about a
series of "meta-remailers" known only to the remailer operators?

 Is this just a case of meta-security through obscurity?

 Then there's that pesky "web of trust" thing....
