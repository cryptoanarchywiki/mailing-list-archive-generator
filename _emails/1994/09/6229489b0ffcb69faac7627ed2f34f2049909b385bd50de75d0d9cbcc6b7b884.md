My ill informed back of the envelope guestimate is that current
art is a factor of one hundred from building a proof of principle
quantum computer,  a factor of one thousand from building a
quantum computer that does something interesting, and a factor
of ten thousand from building a quantum computer that does something
that is actually useful.  Art is improving at (very roughly) a
factor of two every four years.

These estimates may well be rather optimistic, but they are
not totally ridiculous.
