We might also add Shay's Rebellion, Bacon's Rebellion, the Hudson
River Renters' Uprising, the Pullman Strike, the Homestead Strike, the
Ludlow Massacre, the Lawrence Textile Strikes, etc., etc.  Many of
these were full-scale insurrections.  This country's "progress" is
really just a series of grudging concessions made by authoritarian
power structures to various nearly catastrophic crises.

Good observation about periodicity, Jim, but I'd say that the typical
span is much shorter than 100 years.
