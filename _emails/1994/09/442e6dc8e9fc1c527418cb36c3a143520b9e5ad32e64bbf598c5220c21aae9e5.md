Several companies are pursuing advanced lithography techniques and
alternatives to conventional CMOS; the work on "quantum wells" and
"quantum dots" is along these lines. I'm not holding my breath.
(Rather, I *am* holding my Intel stock, as I see no significant chance
that anything will displaced fairly conventional circuitry and
lithography anytime soon.)

In any case, the Shor work on a quantum factorer is interesting, but
is at least several decades away, in my opinion. And even then it is
likely to be "workable" out to some number of digits (roughly, number
of digits = precision needed), by which time the conventional advances
in computer power will mean we're all using 10,000-bit moduli
(especially if we have just heard that NSA has just spend $32 billion to
build a Shor machine able to factor 3000-bit moduli :-} ).

Our own James Donald has written several long essays on Shor's
results, taking a more optimistic (or pessimistic, depending on one's
goals) view. Also, as Sherry noted, extensive discussion pops up in
sci.crypt and the new group, sci.crypt.research.

Bennett and Brassard's quantum cryptography, also discussed
extensively, is closer to be realized practically. (It uses the
Uncertainty Principle for polarized photons in a fiber optic cable to
determine if a channle has been tapped.)

A plug for the Cyphernomicon FAQ: My FAQ has several entries on
quantum methods for crypto. Grep it for quantum, Shor, Brassard,
Bennett, etc.

There is indeed interest in this. But bear in mind that even the most
optimistic proponents admit this stuff is many years, probably many
decades, away. Sort of like where the crypto that now interests us was
in 1925.

(And I think conventional number-theoretic crypto will stay way ahead
of any machines that can ever be built. A gut feel, but based loosely
on the exponential increase in complexity vs. the linear growth in
technology.)
