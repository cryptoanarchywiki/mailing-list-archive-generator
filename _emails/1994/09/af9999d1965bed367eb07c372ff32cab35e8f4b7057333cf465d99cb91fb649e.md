PKZIP encryption broken (known plaintext attack) (Paul Carl Kocher)

Subject: PKZIP encryption broken (known plaintext attack)

I finally found time to take a closer look at the encryption algorithm
by Roger Schlafly that is used in PKZIP and have developed a practical
known plaintext attack that can find the entire 96-bit internal state.

The basic encryption algorithm has four steps, two of which are based on
linear shift registers, one is like a linear congruential, and the final
converts the contents of an internal state register into an 8-bit value to XOR
onto a plaintext byte.  A complete description of the algorithm is included in
the file APPNOTE.TXT, which is included with PKZIP version 1.1 (check Archie
for "pkz110.exe").

Although the algorithm is substantially better than the toy ciphers used in
many products, I have developed a practical known plaintext attack that finds
the 96 bit internal state.  Unlike the ZipCrack program I released a couple
years ago, this attack finds the internal state registers directly and does
not involve a brute-force attack on the password.  If adequate known plaintext
is available, my attack will find the state, regardless of the password's size
or content.

My attack is an improvement on a known plaintext attack described in a paper
by Biham (unpublished work) that takes 2^38+ operations.  My improvements
reduce the amount of work required by approximately a factor of 1500 with 200
bytes of plaintext.  With less plaintext the attack will take somewhat more
time, but just 40 bytes should be enough to be practical.  I've written code
for all steps of the attack; a version written in C with a few optimizations
in inline assembly runs in less than a day on my '486.  The attack will work
with versions 1.1 or 2.xx of PKZIP and other programs using the same
algorithm.

A more in-depth description of the attack will be made available soon, but I
wanted to let people using PKZIP (and any other programs that use the same
algorithm) know immediately about the weakness.
