     We tell children not to do things until they are old enough to be
able to figure it out for themselves. If they cared enough about their
privacy, they'd know. Hell, there's alot I don't know about maintaining
privacy and security. However, I _do_ know that calling from a pay phone
outside of 5 miles from your house is an easy way to take care of the
problem.
