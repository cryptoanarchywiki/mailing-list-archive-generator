I agree with Eric.

I was raised by a chronic societal pessimist, one of the last words of whom
that I remember was "I have seen the Golden Age of America and it's over".
It annoys me just a little when, looking backwards, people trip over a
paradigm shift. It's even worse when they don't know they've tripped.

It's like yelling "theatre" in a crowded fire. Or something.
