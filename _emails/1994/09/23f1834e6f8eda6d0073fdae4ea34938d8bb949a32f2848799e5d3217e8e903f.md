In <199409031519.LAA23930@pipe1.pipeline.com>, jya@pipeline.com passes
along a New York Times article.  Yep, they're sounding scared.  I
saw definite pleading of the government's case in there.  They left out
pedophiles, but they got terrorists, drug dealers and nuclear weapons
smugglers.

Was it just me, or did the tone get a little more frantic when they
started talking about crypto?

And what are they really saying in that closing paragraph?

> Big Brother is dead. The only serious likelihood of his resurrection

> Brothers might bring.

Is this the NYT being out of touch, or are they just showing off their
tentaclehood?  To me, that reads like a threat against those who oppose
the Government Private Agenda.
