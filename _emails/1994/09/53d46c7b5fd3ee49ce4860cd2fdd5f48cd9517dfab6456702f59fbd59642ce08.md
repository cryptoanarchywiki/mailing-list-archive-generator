Isn't it inevitable that this will -- for the same reasons of equity
among the member countries -- evolve into a single set of laws governing
the *use* of crypto throughout the EC?

Can you provide any predictions as to its content?  It seems to me
that the EC may be a *huge* force -- for good or ill -- with respect to
crypto, depending on which way the rules fall out.  In the first place,
because of the sheer size of the EC and the combined power and populace
of its member countries, but also because any internal crypto advantage
the EC is perceived to hold might be an additional spur to liberalization
of US crypto export policy.
