\\
This paper was prepared for the conference ``Public Access
to the Internet,'' JFK School of Government, May 26--27 , 1993.  We
describe some of the technology and costs relevant to pricing access
to and usage of the Internet, and discuss the components of an
efficient pricing structure.  We suggest a possible smart-market
mechanism for pricing traffic on the Internet.

The easiest way to locate these papers is to do a Veronica search on the
string "Economics of the Internet". If you can only handle ftp, the
documents are archived on the anonymous ftp server in the Department of
Economics at Washington University.

form as,
 
9401001.ps.Z and 9401002.ps.Z
