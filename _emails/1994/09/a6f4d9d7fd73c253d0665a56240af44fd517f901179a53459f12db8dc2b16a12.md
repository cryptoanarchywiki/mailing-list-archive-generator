/Funny how the most obvious, no-brainer public policy questions always
/seem to generate the most controversy...

And what, pray tell, is per se wrong with "legal types"?

Why do you think Bollinger, Hellman, Neumann, Patel are knee-jerk 
non-liberals?  (Or even Civiletti for that matter, he's reasonable).

OK there are no *radicals* but what do you expect from the establishment?

I think you will get a respectful hearing if you make sensible comments.  
I have no doubt that you personallly will do the latter.
