    There is a www-security mailing list based at Rutgers
(majordomo@nsmx.rutgers.edu; list name of www-security). From the
introductory majordomo message:

    This list is intended for the discussion of World Wide Web
    security proposals, enhancements and issues.

    Ben Fried of Columbia posted to www-security some NCSA
httpd/xmosaic patches to allow Kerberos 4 authentication. The
University of Michigan is using these patches (with some bug fixes fed
back to Ben) and a similarly patched lynx browser for authenticated
web connections.

    I haven't looked at the code to know whether the network traffic
is encrypted or not.
