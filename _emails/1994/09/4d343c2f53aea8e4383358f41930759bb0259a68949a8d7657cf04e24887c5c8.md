Bruce, 

Was the RC4 posting a sting?

Will Bidzos arrange for an anonymous contract killing of every 
recipient?

But then, is this list not a sting?

So literal kill-files be implemented against the disreputable, 
that is, all of us?

Are Tom Clancy and John Gilmore identical?

Is Tim's epic FAQ the spy novel of our dreams?

Yes, six times over.

Wow.


John
