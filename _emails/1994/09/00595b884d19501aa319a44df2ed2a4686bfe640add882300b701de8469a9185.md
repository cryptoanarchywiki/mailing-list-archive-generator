Only the state can enforce discrimination with guns?!?!?
In the South there is a long history of non-governmental groups
enforcing discrimination with guns.

The argument that discriminating companies will be at a competitive
disadvantage is only valid if all players are rational and informed. There
is good historical evidence that whole cultures are willing to assume this
"disadvantage" in order to perpetuate some status quo. It could easily
become the case than non-discriminating companies would be boycotted
putting the disadvantage on them. I know that anarchy is near and dear to
many hearts here, but there are some really nasty drawbacks to it tyranny
of the majority being just one.
