I assume you mean the last line to read "to prove that D got
this unit from C".

Chaum has demonstrated (In a paper I discussed here a little
over a month ago) that when A, B and E collude they can be sure
that the cash D gave to E is part of the same banknote that B
gave to C.

HOWEVER, it is possible to design a protocol such that
it is NOT possible for A, B and E to be sure that C gave
his money directly to D. (i.e. a protocol can be designed
such that A, B and E can not rule out the possibility that
the cash went from C to F to G to H to I to J to D. Thus,
the solution for entities that are worried about having
their cash marked is to exchange banknotes anonymously
with randomly selected entities before using them again.

Anonymous e-cash can be created such that the identity
of the cheat is immediatelly known as soon as the second
copy of the banknote (or of a part of the banknote)
reaches A. I should think that any protocol which requires
backtracking would be highly undesirable (i.e. D' and
idealy E' should not be bothered).
