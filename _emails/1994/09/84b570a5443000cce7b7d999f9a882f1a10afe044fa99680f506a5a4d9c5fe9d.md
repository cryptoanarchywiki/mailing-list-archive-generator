By refering back to (1) here you are assuming that which is to be 
proven:  It is not a per se offense to run a remailer because that would 
violate your premise that is it not a per se offense to run a remailer.  
Or is your premise based on some other reference?

Instead you might ask how the statute will be read in the context of the 
differing language between the investigation threshold requirement and 
the definition of offense.  Why would one mention intent so explicitly 
and the other ignore it?  Did congress anticipate the difficulty of 
showing intent in this type of prosecution and structure the act 
accordingly?  This would be my argument as a prosecuter.

Ah, but the counter to this arguement (obviously structured well into the 
statute) is that there will never be any investigation into the offense 
without resonable facts to suggest intent.  (This is the killjoy to the 
due process arguement.)

You rely on the construction tending to constitutionality here, but it is 
equally valid to construct the statute as meeting the due process 
requirement via the investagatory intent requirement.  This was my entire 
point.  Given the difference in the requirements between allowing 
investigation and definition of offense, there is a basic imbalance in 
the act.  Why?  Accident, poor drafting? Intent?

Exactly.  So why are they not?  Why is this never mentioned.  I can only 
believe that the structure of the statute is intended to provide this 
arguement as a loophole.  I'm not paranoid enough to want to claim that 
this is to peg remailer operators specifically, (duh) but what are the 
implications for a very soft offense definition in a federal crime bill?

I have not had time to look at 31 USC 5324(3) in detail with reference to 
this problem.  Nor have I looked at the case.  At first glance it looks 
promising, but I remain a skeptic.  It is too tempting to use the 
language in the investigatory intent requirement to dismiss the 
arguements you make.

I must admit to being impressed at this reference however.  I may be 
eating crow soon.

In any event, this is the real key here.  What do you think a judge will 
find encrypted remailing rates on the "nefarious" scale?  In context I 
think it will be quite harsh.  Especially given the very nature of the 
act, (to avoid detection of one thing or another).  I believe anonymous 
remailers have some use.  But they are so targeted to prevent GOVERNMENT 
observation and intercepts, that they just plain look bad.  This would be 
the key distinction in such a case from Raztlaf.  All a judge has to do 
to throw out this entire argument is find that encrypted, traffic 
analysis foiling, anonymous remailers are more nefarious than currency 
structuring.  Given the (lack of) public exposure to the technology, what 
do YOU think this ruling will turn out to be, especially if the only real 
legitimate argument for why remailers are legitimate rests on more 
libertarian grounds.
