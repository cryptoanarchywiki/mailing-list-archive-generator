Hal and Tim point to the vulnerability of the person running 
the remailer to being threatened through the equipment owner 
(like John Perry's recent experience) or squeezed by government 
agents into playing along with surveillors.

This isolation and elimination (or co-optation) of a target has 
worked again and again to destroy networks once they become 
serious threats to law and order.

Hal's warning is wisely heeded until all the remailer 
beneficiaries are bear an equal share of the risks of being 
charged a "supporting terrorist".
