                         CLIPPER INSIDE
"CLinton's Orwellian plan to bug every compute,telephone,and fax...

 * Does a fair job on clipper.
 * mentions Matt Blaze's paper but gets it wrong.
 * does a side blurb on the EFF.
 * does another side blurb on PGP.
 * mentions Digital Telephony but doesn't mention EFF/FBI 
   collaboration.
 * essentially very Anti-clipper
 * picture on page 46 alone worth the price of admission hehe...
