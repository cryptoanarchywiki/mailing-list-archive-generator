My recent post on use of PGP in architectural documents is 
limited to those produced by an all-volunteer group that 
provides free services.  This work is often controversial and 
needs privacy protection.

My commercial work does not yet deserve such elegant dressing.  
If and when it does I will relish paying for PRZ's hard work 
through his market channels.

John
