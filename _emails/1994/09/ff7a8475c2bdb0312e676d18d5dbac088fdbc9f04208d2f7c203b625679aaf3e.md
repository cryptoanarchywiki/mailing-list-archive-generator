Even the crime bill doesn't apply _ex post facto_, meaning anything
newly illegal under the crime bill wasn't illegal before it.  In
particular, any discussion about remailers, discussion which has
already happened and which might be construed as conspiracy for a
newly illegal action, cannot now be subject to the terms of a new
bill.  Even more in particular, any discussion of remailers that has
already happened is perfectly safe.

And as for me, I don't plan on shutting up now.

Eric
