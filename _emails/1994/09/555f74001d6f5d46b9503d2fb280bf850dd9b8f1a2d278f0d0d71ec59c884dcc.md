There are some theories that various 'power' segments of society
actively cultivate a particular working model for their own benefit.
Foremost, of course, are Clergy, lawyers, and gov.  (Has anyone heard
of 'Neo-Tech'?)

I've always thought and recently espoused that there should be classes
from the beginning of highschool on philosophy and sociology.  I
suppose the problem would be which philosophy and whose spin on things
the schools would encourage.

I just think that too many people don't think of themselves on the
'meta' level.  (Thinking about what they think and do and why.)  I had
my little crisis at 13.

Not to mention the fact that there would be more atheists... :-)
