Some belive that human action is automatic, while semming to be by 
choice, that the past of this persones life defines how they will react 
to a certin situation. I do however agree that someone does decide on 
there own that they will commit a criminal act, however if people 
protected themselves would they be acted apon? If you use PGP does 
someone else read your E-Mail? If not what happens? (assumming that you 
are writing something that someone else will want to intercept, ect.)

I have known many people to be this way. They will and DO take every 
advantage of any situation they can.

The United States is made up of ignorant people who know what they need 
to get by in life, and do not want to take the time to do what it takes 
to improve themselves, ie. vote. As for morality, I feel it is somthing 
that we all wish to be but find it hard to be. I know I find it hard to 
be moral.
