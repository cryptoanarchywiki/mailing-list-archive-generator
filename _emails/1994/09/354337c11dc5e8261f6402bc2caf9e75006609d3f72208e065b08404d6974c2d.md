| newsreader, there was a way to set up killfiles with a certain number of
| days before they would timeout and be removed from the killfile.

	The rep. credit system that I sketched out a few days ago would
alliviate the need to edit your procmail rules by hand for those mail
message you choose to filter.  The way I had pictured setting it up
would have a procmail rule which would query a reputation database
(stored in the users account.)  The query would return a number, which
procmail could then act on.

	No timing features at the user level, but I've considered
putting in a decaying value for credit, to prevent entries from living
forever.  I doubt this would be in early versions.

	Lastly, I'm getting around to sketching out data structures,
the only problem I have to address in theory is how to prevent the
system from becoming a spam factory; deluging people who don't use the
system with piles of messages that they don't want.  Several inelegant
server based solutions appear (they often do), but I'm hoping to
design something more elegant.
