Here's a soft copy.  At least you can say it appears to present a consistent
point of view.  That should be good for the keynote speakers, Mr. Freeh and
Mr. Gore.  (The soft copy shows Mr. Glickman as the other keynote; a hardcopy
in front of me here shows Mr. Gore --I don't know which is more recent.)

$595 tuition -- that's more than Crypto '94, eh?

        International Cryptography Institute 1994: Global Challenges

                          September 22-23, 1994
                       Ritz Carlton, Washington, DC

	                       Presented by
	     The National Intellectual Property Law Institute 


The International Cryptography Institute will focus on problems and
challenges associated with the use of cryptography within nations and
for international communications.  The Institute will address such
questions as:  What are the different national policies and regulations
governing cryptography and how might these evolve?  What cryptographic
technologies are on the market in different countries, what is being
used, and what is it being used for?  What problems is cryptography
causing law enforcement?  What are the requirements of businesses and
other organizations?  What are the new trends in cryptography and what
will be their impact on society?  What efforts are leading toward an
international cryptography framework?  The Institute is for government
officials, industry leaders, policy makers and analysts, researchers,
and users of cryptographic technologies.
