No pgp -c creates a conventionally encrypted file that appears
to be a conventionally encrypted file. If you run such a file
thru pgp, pgp will report that it is a conventionally encrypted file
even if you do not know the password. If you have such a file Darth
Vader will assume that you can decrypt it.

My hack allows you to created a file which appears to be pgp public key
encrypted to someone else, but which you also (or perhaps you only) can
decrypt. (Because you have specified or recored the conventional idea
key.) Hopefully, Darth will be fooled in to thinking that you can not
decrypt the file.
