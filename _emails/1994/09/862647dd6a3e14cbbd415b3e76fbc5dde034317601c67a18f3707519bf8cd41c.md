I don't know how true this is in general, but my research into the
arms export question indicated otherwise.  Here is part of a posting I
sent to CP some time last year concerning a case in which the defendant
did in fact drive to Mexico with a truck load of ammunition:

Perhaps the arms export laws are worded differently than some others
and so the more stringent rules apply.
