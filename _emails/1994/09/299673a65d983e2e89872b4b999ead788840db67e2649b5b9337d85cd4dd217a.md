Soon most remailers will be run on equipment owned by the operator.  At the
last NJ computer show I attended, I could have purchased a 486/66 with a
paltry 250 meg HD for $999.  Then all we have to worry about are the network
connections but in a few years, we'll be able to do high-speed "dial up"
connections from our home boxes to other (and different) systems anywhere on
the nets.  Hard to track.

They can afford to intimidate a few remailers but "enforcement doesn't scale
well."  (Another DCF quote.)  Networks, software, and hardware scale much
better than enforcement resources.  Swamping effect.
