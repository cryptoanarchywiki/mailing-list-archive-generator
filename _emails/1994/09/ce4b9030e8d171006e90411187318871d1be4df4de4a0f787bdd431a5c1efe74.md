"Sneakers" was not an "old" movie..."old" is something I saw in 1960!
1992 is also the year Cypherpunks got started (Eric can elaborate, but
I think he met a lot of the "Wired" planning team at a "Sneakers"
sneak (ers) showing in San Francisco.)

In any case, Len Adelman, the "A" in "RSA," was a technical advisor in
the film. The pseudo-mathematical cant in the movie was probably
provided by him.

Not exactly an ex-starving Cypherpunk. (Adelman was also Fred Cohen's
thesis advisor at the University of Southern California, and has done
a lot of work on computer viruses.)
