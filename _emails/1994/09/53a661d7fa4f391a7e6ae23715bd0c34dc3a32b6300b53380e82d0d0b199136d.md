              ^^^^^^^^^^ this one, at least has been released
and should be at your local computer store RSN. I've been on the NT
beta test, and it is really nice. The built in SLIP/PPP will massivly
increase the number of real internet hosts.

It is easy to use and robust. They don't ship Cello/Mosaic, but that
is trivial to add.

Much more than working deals, Microsoft wants to be an Internet Serivce
Provider (ISP), much like Apple and IBM have recently become. IBM's new
OS/2 has a "one button" signon/configuration onto their service. Apple has
been bundling eWorld for a while.

But I don't see Tim's OS-oriented collusion.
The EFF sell out clearly focused on defining service providors and then
excluding then, specifically, from the burden of DTB. Doesn't look
like they like GAK any more than Tim or me.
