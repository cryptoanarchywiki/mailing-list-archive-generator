Responding to msg byJohn E. Kreznar:

More useful than the rulers-ruled division is the 
division into those  who gratuitously accept the 
benefits of government (usually without even  realizing 
that this is why government gets so big), and those who 
 scrupulously avoid gratuitous involvement with 
government.  The latter  are an infinitesimal fraction 
who are being overwhelmed by the former. 
 
.................................................................

The latter must find a way to live their way in spite of the 
rest of them.
It's the individual against the mindless State, you know. (or 
the Mindless Condition)
