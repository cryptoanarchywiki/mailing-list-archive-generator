BEWARE CELLULAR CONFIDENCES
Lawyers who use cellular phones to discuss private matters with clients are
increasingly turning toward encryption technology to protect confidential
information. Boston-based SafeCall, a company that guarantees secure
cellular conversations by routing the calls through its scrambler, says its
largest and fastest growing contingent of customers is lawyers. Meanwhile,
a six-step set of how-to instructions for turning a Motorola flip-phone
into a cellular call receiver was posted on the Internet. (Wall Street
Journal 9/1/94 B1)
