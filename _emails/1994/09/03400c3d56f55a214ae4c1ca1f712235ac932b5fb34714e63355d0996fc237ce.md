Yes, Phil Karn posted a list of such numbers to the list last May, and
the program used to generate them.  Since some people have expressed
their distaste for large files re-posted/forwarded to the list, I won't
send it, but you can get it from ftp cs.cmu.edu:
/afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr12/mg5n/public/Karn.DH.generator
