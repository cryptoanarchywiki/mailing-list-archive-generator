Subject: List of reliable remailers
Message-ID: <199409061808.LAA00513@kiwi.CS.Berkeley.EDU>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


   I have written and installed a remailer pinging script which
collects detailed information about remailer features and reliability.

   To use it, just finger remailer-list@kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu

   There is also a Web version of the same information, at:
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html

   Please let me know about any other remailers which I missed. I've
only included remailers which can mail to arbitrary addresses, so I
already know chop and twwells are missing.

   This information is used by premail, a remailer chaining and PGP
encrypting client for outgoing mail, which is available at:
ftp://kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/raph/premail-0.22.tar.gz

This is the current info:

                                 REMAILER LIST

   This is an automatically generated listing of remailers. The first
   part of the listing shows the remailers along with configuration
   options and special features for each of the remailers. The second
   part shows the 10-day history, and average latency and uptime for each
   remailer. You can also get this list by fingering
   remailer-list@kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu.

   Options and features

   cpunk
          A major class of remailers. Supports Request-Remailing-To:
          field.

   eric
          A variant of the cpunk style. Uses Anon-Send-To: instead.

   penet
          The third class of remailers (at least for right now). Uses
          X-Anon-To: in the header.

   pgp
          Remailer supports encryption with PGP. A period after the
          keyword means that the short name, rather than the full email
          address, should be used as the encryption key ID.

   oldpgp
          Remailer does not like messages encoded with MIT PGP 2.6. Other
          versions of PGP, including 2.3a and 2.6ui, work fine.

   hash
          Supports ## pasting, so anything can be put into the headers of
          outgoing messages.

   ksub
          Remailer always kills subject header, even in non-pgp mode.

   nsub
          Remailer always preserves subject header, even in pgp mode.

   latent
          Supports Matt Ghio's Latent-Time: option.

   cut
          Supports Matt Ghio's Cutmarks: option.

   special
          Accepts only pgp encrypted messages.

   History key
     * # response in less than 5 minutes.
     * * response in less than 1 hour.
     * + response in less than 4 hours.
     * - response in less than 24 hours.
     * . response in more than 1 day.
     * _ response came back too late (more than 2 days).


   If you've got a Web page, please feel free to include a link to
this page. If you think your Web page is relevant to the subject of
remailers, let me know and I'll link it in.

   Comments and suggestions welcome!

   Note to remailer operators: this script generates hourly ping
messages. If you don't want that, let me know and I will take your
mailer off the list, or increase the interval between pings.
