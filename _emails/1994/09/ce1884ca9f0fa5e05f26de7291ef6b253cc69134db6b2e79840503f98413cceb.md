I needed a few of these primes a while ago, so I took a few minutes and
hacked Phil's code to operate distributed (ie. a central machine
carried out the sieving and handed off candidates to a set of other
machines to do the Rabin-Miller). With one Sun Sparc 690MP and approx
40 Sun Sparc LX's, it was getting results like:

That's 2 hours for a 2048 prime P where (P - 1)/2 is also prime, and they
also satisfied the constraint that P = 3(mod 4).

The software maintains a TCP connection to each "Rabin-Miller server"
and can dynamically deal with the loss of machines, but in it's
simplicity doesn't do reconnects.  If anyone who operates an FTP
archive wants to reply to me, I'll tar it up (in it's current "it works
for me, but no guarantees" state).

Speaking of primes with constraints, I got my hands on Harn's recent
paper on a PKCS based on both factoring and discrete logs. He wants his
modulus to be a prime P = 2p x q + 1, where p = 2r + 1, q = 2s + 1. All
P, q, q, r, s must be prime -- good luck in finding such primes by
probablistic methods !
