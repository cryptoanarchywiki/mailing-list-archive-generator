But if you proceed "in forma pauperis" you don't need to know how to write one.

Must a person carry around a legal dictionary in order to have all the 
right terms to use just in case they are put in jail and to need to 
select the proper procedure?

(What shall it be:  habeas corpus? subjuciendum? forma pauperis?  I'm 
so confused.)
