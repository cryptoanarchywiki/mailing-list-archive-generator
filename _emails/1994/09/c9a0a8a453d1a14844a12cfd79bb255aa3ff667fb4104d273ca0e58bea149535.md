Never mind the keystroke logs, if his line was wiretapped they have all
of the keystrokes coming in and going out. Get his secret keyring from
Netcom and they could monitor his communications with out a problem.

What illusion of security? If I have my secret keyring residing someplace
where I can't physically control who has access to it, no way is this
keyring secure!! It goes against the definition of a secret. Once you tell
someone a secret, It no longer is a secret. In effect this person has told
Netcom his secret, therefore it no longer is a secret. Just because you're
paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get you. Be paranoid!!

This just goes to prove that no matter how secure the crypto system is, if
it is implemented in an insecure way, the whole system is compromised. If
you are using a "One Time Pad" to communicate with someone and you make an
extra set of pages and give them to someone that you really don't know and
trust (Netcom), no way can you call this secure. Even though most will
agree that the "One Time Pad" is the most secure crypto system, it is being
implemented in an insecure way hence it is insecure.
