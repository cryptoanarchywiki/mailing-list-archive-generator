It is strange.  Actually, Caro-Kann and RSADSI are partners, as
Cylink apparently formed a subsidiary just to shelter themselves
from the liability of being partners with Bidzos.  Cylink has
some RSA-based products, and Bidzos had formally threatened (in
writing) a lawsuit claiming Cylink doesn't have an RSA license.
Cylink claims Bidzos denied them a license, even though they have
agreements which obligate him otherwise.  It is unclear to me
whether this is just a royalty dispute (ie Cylink wants a *free*
license) or whether Bidzos doesn't want them in the RSA business.
At any rate, they appear to be bitter enemies now.  They have
jeapordized all of their future patent royalties by going to
court.
