You forget Weber's definition of government, which I remember as "the
institution with a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence within a
geographical area".  I may have substituted "violence" for "force", but
that is the gist of his meaning.

Unless a government has some means of coercing its more recalcitrant
subjects, it can't function as a government in the sense we mean it here.
