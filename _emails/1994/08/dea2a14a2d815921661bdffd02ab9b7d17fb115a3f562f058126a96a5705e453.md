True, but we desire something that scales linearly with use.

So you are pointing out that Charles has the ability to move the system
towards a one-time fee system. This is true, but the logic in the above
paragraph is tainted by the fact that the insurance company can shift the
payouts so that the frequency of challenges becomes arbitraily small.
Charles becomes unable to properly charge some customers without overcharging
others.

I agree, I only suggested it because it doesn't look likr cryptography
can help me out here.

Maybe I'm looking at it wrong. The challenge is to pay the certifier based
on the value he provides. Perhaps in situations like these YOU are providing
the per use value and the service of the certification agency is of the
one-time nature. Suppose you have created a piece of software which is
compatible with system X. You need somebody to certify that compatibility.
Each time you sell a copy of that software you receive a certain amount
extra because its compatibility has been certified, but I could argue that
the extra value is due to the carefulness of the programer and that the
value created by the certifier really is one time.

But what about systems in which selling signatures on a one time basis is
truly critical to operation. Consider the example of a user who is going
to buy a car. This characteristic is worth a lot of money to companies who
sell cars, but they need a way to verify it. I have envisioned (and even
written some code for) agents that would come along and offer gift
certificates good for any car in class X. The gift certificates would sell
below face value. The agent who sells these certificates can then use the
information that it has sold you the certificate to attract advertisers at
a high price. You save the amount by which the gift certificate was
discounted, the agent keeps any money made beyond the discount, and the
advertisers get the attention of a hot prospect. But how could this system
work if pay-per use authentication is not possible?

[now that I think about it, I guess it is possible to contact the
advertisers ahead of time and be promised a bounty for each prospect
found.]

Cheers,
