Ameritech/Citibank is running a home banking system right now.  You
can buy a display phone that accepts a Citibank smartcard and gives
you complete access to your accounts, it functions just like an
ATM, except you can't currently deposit and withdraw. Digicash is
rumoured to be forthcomming. Also as part of the startup, the white
pages are available. The phones are made by Philips, I'm still
trying to track down the exact nature of the smart cards
encryption, although I was told it was "Standard bank encryption."

I was in charge of installation for this project.

I'll keep everyone informed.
