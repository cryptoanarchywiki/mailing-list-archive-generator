Come on, Bob, we've talked about a lot of problems in the last few weeks: the
prohibitions on most forms of bearer bonds; the prohibitions on banks
issuing their own currency; the stringent regulations for private scrip
circulation.  Our people who know securities law can probably list a few
more.

OK, but also one way to find out whether it is legal or not is to test it.
If you end up in jail, I guess it wasn't legal.  Maybe that's not the
best strategy, though?

Send mail to netbank-info@agents.com for info on their non-anonymous (I
think) cash-like system.  I wonder whether they have worried about these
issues or whether they are trying out the strategy above.
