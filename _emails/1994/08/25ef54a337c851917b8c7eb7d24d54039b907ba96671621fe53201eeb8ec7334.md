	I just finished (last night) Guns of the South, by Harry
Turtledove.  Before that I read Out of Control by Kevin Kelly.  Both
were recommended by folks on this list, and both were very good.

	Does anyone else care to share thoughts on books they're read
recently?   I'm looking for anything interesting.  Also, could anyone
recommend a good intro to F.A. Hayek's work?  (in or out of print;
Boston has many good used bookstores.)

Politics.  From the greek "poly," meaning many, and ticks, a small,
annoying bloodsucker.
