I disagree with this.  I can't find the line of reasoning here.  The
only guaruntee of patent and (and to some extent) copyright to the
holder is right to collect fees.  Once you have collected those fees
and if future fees are not in jepeordy, you don't have 'standing' to
complain, as I see it.

Makes no sense, unless they are talking about you giving out the
modified version.
