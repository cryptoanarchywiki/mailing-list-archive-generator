It was suggested by one of the NSA folks at CRYPTO that they should
have done a rump session talk on the "NSA Offensive Driving School",
which would completely explain the alleged threat to run Bidzos over.

In addition, not only were the 'behind schedule' shirts a big hit with
the NSA folk I saw, but at least some of them were going to get 'Sink
Clipper' posters for their offices.
