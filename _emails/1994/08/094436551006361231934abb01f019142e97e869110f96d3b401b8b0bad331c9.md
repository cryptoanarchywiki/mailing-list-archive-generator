A laptop containing Lady Di's medical records has been stolen out of her
therapists office. Seems that the British press is holding its breath
expecting the thief to forward any found information to the newsrags.

This is the second time that the royal family could have been saved
potentially great embarrassment by the use of encryption. For those who
forgot: the first time was when Price Charles adulterous conversations on
an non-encrypted cell phone were intercepted and made public by the press.

Cypherpunks help royals ;-) ?
