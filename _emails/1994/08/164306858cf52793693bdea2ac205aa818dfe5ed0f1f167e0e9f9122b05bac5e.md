The NetMarket Company is now offering PGP-encrypted Mosaic sessions for
securely transmitting credit card information over the Internet.  Peter
Lewis wrote an article on NetMarket on page D1 of today's New York Times
(8/12/94).  For more information on NetMarket, connect to 

	http://www.netmarket.com/

or, 	telnet netmarket.com

There is no charge to browse around the service and no charge to set
up an account.  The NetMarket Company is currently offering CDs from
Noteworthy Music and flowers from 800-THE-ROSE.  If you do not have access
to a PGP-capable version of X Mosaic, NetMarket also allows accounts to be
set-up toll-free by calling 800-867-3777 or by sending PGP encrypted
e-mail to pgp@netmarket.com.

NetMarket was able to offer this service because Phil Zimmerman's PGP
is now free and available for personal use and because support for
encryption functions had been added to the recent versions of X Mosaic
software from the NCSA.  NetMarket has secured a commercial license
for PGP, configured our server to allow encrypted transactions and
provided directions for configuring X Mosaic and exchanging public
keys.

For more information on NetMarket, please e-mail or finger
info@netmarket.com or use the automated comments page after connecting to
our server.  NetMarket's public key is available by fingering
pgp@netmarket.com and on our WWW server.
