I grant you that "impressive" is not too specific but "body burden" is 
a common way of referring to the material which is taken into the body 
and retained.  Typically, most material inhaled or ingested is quickly
exhaled or excreted out of the body.  Some exposure (and dose) accrues
during this time.  If some material remains deposited in the body,
exposure continues.

By the standards of the time, workers during WWII were pretty well
protected.  By our standards, which may be overly conservative, some
WWII-era workers received large doses and/or body burdens.  Because 
these workers (1) had exposures and (2) were monitored, they are the
group of choice for epidemiological studies.

I would be happy to hold a kilo of unshielded plutonium in my hand.
I would probably think it wise to wash it later.  Pu is an alpha emitter.
Its radiation will not penetrate the dead layer of the skin.

I have held pieces of uranium in my hand.  I'm still here.

I would bet that you could get a lot more effect for your terrorist
dollar with aerosols of any number of other, more commonly available 
substances (like gasoline).

I don't have ready access to a good library right now to go pull
references but if you follow up on the references to these three
papers, you should find more than you will ever care to read on
the topic:

Wilkinson, G.S.; Tietjen, G.L.; Wiggs, L.D.; Galke, W.A; Acquavella,
J.F.; Reyes M.; Voelz, G.L.; Waxweiler, R.J.   Mortality among 
plutonium and other radiation workers at a plutonium weapons facility.
Am. J. Epidemiol. 125:231-250; 1987.

Checkoway, H.; Mathew, R.M. Shy, C.M.; Watson, J.E. Jr.; Tankersley, 
W.G.; Wolf, S.H.; Smith, J.C.; Fry, S.A.  Radiation, work experience, 
and cause specific mortality among workers at an energy research 
laboratory.  Br. J. Indust. Med. 42:525-533; 1985.

Cohort Study of Lung Cancer, Ionizing Radiation, and Tobacco Smoking

>To repeat my point: you say that statistical studies of workers in

>the effects of radiation show that radiation has done little harm.

Loosely put, the studies say, "Workers at facility X whose exposures
varied from {small} to {large} showed/did not show increased 
death rates from {long lists of diseases}."

>Well, I should hope so.

>On the other hand I say that such studies are poor criteria for

Well, these studies are about all we have to go on right now.  The
wartime residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki do provide a large set of 
folks exposed to "radiation intended to do the maximum possible harm" 
but, darn it, none of them were wearing dosimeters.  People do study 
these groups, making educated guesses about doses, but it's hard to
draw precise conclusions on that basis.


To draw this off-topic topic to a close, I recommend the following to
help bring the various risks into perspective:

Cohen, B.L.; Catalog of Risks Extended and Updated.  Health Physics, 
61:317-335, 1991.

Sorry for disputing.
