I suspect the shippers will surrender their shipping documents when they are
faced with the removal of their bonds. This seems like a very shaky proposition at best.

As to using an anonymouse third party, by placing them at risk this opens them
up to various tactics. For instance, they could be given immunity from any 
charges and then they would be compelled to rat me out.

In every example that deals with the delivery of tangible goods (which is the
majority of what we purchase) the anonymity breaks down at the delivery point.
You have to prove you are the one who is justifiably taking possession. This
to me is a big hole in the system.
