Yes, presumably the NSA (etc) has filters to deal with such spook lines,
however it must be irritating to have to include filters, and lose the
efficiency of plain string searches. A large enough number of messages
with the words NSA Plutonium AK-47 bomb interspersed means having to 
include filters, human and automated. 

As long as people come up with new ways to frustrate their filters, 
rather than just append a fixed set of words to the final lines of 
their message, then they have to waste (comparatively) valuable
programmers and CPU time keeping their scanners up to date.

Only irritating, true, but I reserve the right to irritate such
buggers :-)
