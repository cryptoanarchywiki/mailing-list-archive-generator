BY POPULAR DEMAND

After consulting and working with Eric, I've made a digested version of 
the cypherpunks mailing list available to the public. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it is

The cypherpunks-digest is a digested version of the mailing list
cypherpunks@toad.com.  The contents of the mail from cypherpunks-digest is
IDENTICAL to the contents on the standard cypherpunks mailing list except
that they are delivered in a single message of several postings instead of
one at a time;  the digested version is presented to allow lurkers and
infrequent readers the chance to have fewer messages in their mailbox.  In
addition, the list is being archived and back issues along with detailed,
by-subject indexes are available via a mail-based automated file server. 

To subscribe to this version of cypherpunks, you need to send a message 
to majordomo@vorlon.mankato.msus.edu containing the line: 

	subscribe cypherpunks-digest

Once you are subscribed to the digested version, you will probably want 
to unsubscribe to the individual-message list by sending a message to 
majordomo@toad.com containing the line:
	
	unsubscribe cypherpunks

In addition, starting today, postings to cypherpunks with be archived,
indexed and available through the following methods: 

A)      send the majordomo@vorlon.mankato.msus.edu address the command 'index
        cypherpunks-digest'.  In return, you will get a directory listing
        of all the available file.

        There are two important files in addition to the digest
        archives.

        CONTENTS
                This file contains a listing of the subjects within each
                individual digest.  It is sorted by digest number

        TOPICS
                This file will list the subjects that are available in the
                entire archive, and tell you which digests those subjects
                appeared in.

B)      Once you have determined which messages you want to get, you send
        the majordomo address the command 'get cypherpunks-digest
        filename'.  In return, you will get those requested files
        delivered to you via email.  If you are getting multiple files,
        put each 'get' command on a seperate line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have any questions, please let me know.
