I've seen it. I'm the guy that wrote s-tools (available from 
ftp.dsi.unimi.it).  My package will hide files in GIFs, BMPs and WAVs, 
using the probabalistic method that I described, and using decent (but 
damn slow) quantization to reduce the original colour resolution.  Built-in 
encryption methods are IDEA, DES, 3DES, MPJ2 (128, 256, 384, 512 bit keys)
and NSEA.  Operating modes are selectable from ECB, CBB, CFB, OFB and 
PCBC. If you are going to download it, make sure you get version 2.

I'm currently on the look out for new steganography ideas (you might have 
seen the patches I wrote that allow files to be hidden in gzip compressed 
files). I thought of a load of obvious stuff like adding/not adding 
spaces at the end of lines of a text file, carefully choosing assembler 
instructions where two are available, etc. Has anyone got any more ideas?


Regards,
