Nice in theory, but....
 
How do know if someone is anonymous? Doesn't the act of checking itself 
show that you have doubts?
What if someone using their real name posts that they have seen a flying 
saucer? Or posts an astrological prediction? If someone believes 
everything they are told, the consequence is their responsibility.
 
Just my $2.00 worth. (I value my opinion 100 times greater than other's)
