Read the drafts, show up at IETF meetings, and subscribe to the
working group mailing lists. (The list subscribe address is
ipsec-request@ans.net; however, I'll caution that we do work on that
mailing list, its not like cypherpunks. Distracting from the
discussion, and posts from newbies who haven't followed the work thus
far, are not encouraged. This isn't to say that new people are
unwelcome; its just to say that it IS a working group, and its been in
progress for a while.)
