I misread the wording of the bill. It carefully defines information service
providers, and then many pages later says that they are not covered
by the requirements of the bill.

At least this is the text of the hardcopy that I have, and in the
text files in the ftp.eff.org files. (The EFF files seem to be
exactly what I have, except for formatting, etc.)

Since it explicitly excludes information service firms, I expect that
remailer operators are safe from this one.

I appologise for any confusion I've caused. And I still think the bill
is a crock.

The bill has not been thru "markup" so the wordings, inclusions and
exclusions may change. Some bills even go thru markup after they
are voted on. This may be one of those, altho with the defeat of
crime bill, the politicians are pretty busy today.
