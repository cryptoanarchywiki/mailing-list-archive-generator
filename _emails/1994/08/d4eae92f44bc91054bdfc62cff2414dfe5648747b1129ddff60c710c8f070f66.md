Dear Friend

     I am sending this special announcement to all of the addresses of
net.friends that I found in my mailbox. I have come across a book that I am
sure that many of you may be interested in. This is a one-time, special
announcement and is _not_ the start of new mailing list. The book is, in my
opinion, important enough to tell all of you about.

     "What A Long Strange Trip It's Been" is now available in an autographed,
limited edition printing. This new and updated version of Sanders' 1989
underground classic has the reviewers raving. Readers can't put it down.
Colleges are using it with great success in American History and Sociology
classes. With unique first-hand knowledge of the subject, Sanders writes a
detailed account of the people and events of the era. Users of my InfoBot
might be especially interested in the appendix regarding 'world domination'.

     To obtain a brief flyer containing excerpts, a synopsis, and reviews
about this riveting account of major trends of the last three decades, simply
send a message to walstib-info@andronix.org. The author may also be reached at
walstib@andronix.org <Lewis Sanders>. If you are not interested, _please_
_disregard_this_message_.

Regards, -A. J.-

TREATY. "... Treaties usually provide for their own termination, but
independently of that it has been held that when a treaty becomes dangerous
to the life or incompatible with the independence of a state or a permanent
obstacle to the development of its constitution or the rights of its
people, it can be abdicated, and also when the condition of affairs which
formed the basis of the treaty has become so modified by time that its
execution has become contrary to the nature of things and the original
intent of the parties: 22 Ct. Cls. 408." --Bouvier's Law Dictionary, 1897
edition. (Is NAFTA a "treaty" or an "agreement"?!)
