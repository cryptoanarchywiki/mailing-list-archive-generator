*Any* bill that passes will have all sorts of juicy, privacy-invading
provisions.

Leftists in the "privacy community" will have to decide which they like
better:  privacy or "health security."

There's no way you can have a government-directed, third-party-paid, health
care "system" without throwing privacy out the window.  Bureaucracies *keep*
records, they don't destroy them.  

Our president likes the "German System" -- 'nuff said.

"According to the CBO report on the 'Clinton-Mitchell Bill,' the effective
marginal tax rate on some lucky moderate income families ($20K-$30K) will be
85%(!) due to 1) ordinary taxes, (2) phase out of the earned income tax
credit, and (3) phase out of health insurance subsidies under the
'Clinton-Mitchell Bill'."
