Subject:  Zimmermann/NSA debate in California

There will be a debate between Philip Zimmermann and Clinton Brooks of
the National Security Agency, on Thursday, 25 August, at 5:45pm Pacific
Time, in Thousand Oaks, California.  

The debate is organized by the World Affairs Council, and will be held
at the Thousand Oaks Inn, at 75 Thousand Oaks Blvd.  To get there, take
Highway 101 north from LA to the Moorpark exit, turn right onto
Moorpark, left at first light, one block down on right side.

The debate will be on the issues of crime, terrorism, privacy and
civil liberties on the information superhighway, and the role of
cryptography in these issues.

Philip Zimmermann is the creator of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), the most
widely used software in the world for E-mail encryption.  Zimmermann is
under criminal investigation for publishing free encryption software,
resulting in its widespread use around the world, allegedly in
violation of US export restrictions on encryption software.

Clinton Brooks is assistant to the director of the NSA, and was
instrumental in the creation of the controversial Clipper Chip and the
Escrowed Encryption Standard.

There will be cocktails and a light buffet at 5:45, and the program 
will start at 6:30.  Admission is $15 if you preregister, or $25 at
