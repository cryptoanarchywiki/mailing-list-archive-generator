Not the untraceable cash systems most of us are interested in, that's
for sure. Since transactions between "Alice" and "Bob" are invisible
to outsiders, and they may not even know the identity of the other,
then it's hard to imagine how the Tax Man interjects himself.

Unless of course some "escrow" system is mandated, and independent
schemes are extirpated ruthlessly. Not a pretty sight.

In the crypto anarchist future I envision, this will never happen.
Mike and his friends are of course free to donate some or all of their
earnings to provide a "guaranteed annual income" for others, but not
me.

But this gets into basic ideological issues, so I'll stop now.

The crypto significance is that strong crypto makes many things Mike
wants essentially impossible to achieve, fortunately.

Huh? This paragraph does not compute.
