Actually, I would be surprised if the "SIMD" processors were not a huge
array of reprogrammable FPGA's, quite possibly Xilinx's.  The possibilities
of a large array of these chips, each with local memory, is quite
interesting.  I have personally seen an array of 64 Xilinx chips in a DEC PeRL
box doing RSA, at speeds similar or better to almost all available custom
hardware implementations of the cipher.

BTW, with a purchase of half a million chips, economies of scale would get
the devices well within budget.
