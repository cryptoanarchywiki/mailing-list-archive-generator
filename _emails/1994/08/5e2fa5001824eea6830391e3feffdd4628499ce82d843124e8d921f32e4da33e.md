Soda was down for a week while it was moved to a different location.  The
new address is "remailer@soda.csua.berkeley.edu".  I'm told that the old
address will continue to work for a limited time, but it's best to get in
the habit of using the correct one.

I also understand that the crypto archives have also moved, but I'm not
really sure of the details.
