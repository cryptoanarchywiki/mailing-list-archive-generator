Am I the only one that's struck by the similarity between the propaganda
 about the Waco massacre and the propaganda preceding the Persion Gulf
 massacre?

[For those who don't know, a good deal of the stories about Iraqi 
 attrocities were totally manufactured.  Read "Second Front" (author
 last name "Truman", I believe) for an account from a reporter's
 perspective of how the Pentagon manipluated stories and therefore
 public opionion]

 propaganda machine that the US government has working for it if we
 hope to oppose them successfully on crypto issues]
