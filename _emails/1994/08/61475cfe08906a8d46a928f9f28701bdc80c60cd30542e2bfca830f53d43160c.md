It may not be so, but this example is not relevant.  A barter scheme is
not a financial instrument or an exchange of financial instruments.  If
you agree to exchange a refrigerator for ten hours with your favorite
shrink, no financial instruments change hands.	But the IRS sees that
your shrink is making "money" and not reporting it.

When you fly into the US, you must fill out a customs declaration.
You are required to declare money in various forms (cash, checks,
etc) and then to sign a statement saying that your declaration is
true.  I believe that you must declare anything over a relatively
small amount, a few thousand dollars.

Banks are required to declare cash deposits and international movements
of funds over either $5K or $10K, I forget which.  The objective is
to make money laundering difficult.
