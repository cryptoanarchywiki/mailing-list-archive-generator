Except that the fix has been a *long* time coming. Hasn't it been about a
month since I complained about this? And there's still not even a simple
readme on the distribution site.

As I said before, if it's serious enough to shout to the world, "we
goofed," then it's serious enough to take the ten seconds necessary to
make the fix or make the instructions on how to do so obviously available.

The EFF has sold us out, and this is making MIT look rather unprofessional.
