I think I can shed light on the report: a guy posted a message through
the remailer addressed to BlackNet, and encrypted the message with PGP so
it could be read either by himself or by L. Detweiler's BlackNet key.  I
posted a response that mentioned the user ID associated with his key.  He
assumed I had penetrated the remailer, not realizing he had exposed his
key ID nor that his key was on a server.
