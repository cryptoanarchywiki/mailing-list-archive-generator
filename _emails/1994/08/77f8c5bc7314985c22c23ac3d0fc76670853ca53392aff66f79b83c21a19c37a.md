WHAT?!? If I want to sell some stock and I want to figure out how much it is
worth, I go to the Bloomberg in the Sloan basement and get a 15 minute
delayed quote. If I want to buy something in Mexico with dollars, I look at
the exchange rate in the bank or in my hotel. If I want to buy something
in digicash, I check the exchange rate, and then I conduct the transaction.
Where is the problem here?

OK, I see the problem. You are assuming that certificates will be issued
at a consistent set of notional values. (like ten bucks, five bucks ect.)
The correct way to do things [:-] is to set the notional value of new
certificates based on the trading value of old certificates. Suppose the
first certificate had a principal of $10 and is now worth $11, then the
new certificates that I issue will have their principal adjusted so that
including the effect of interest rates, my new certificate is worth as much
as your old certificate. Thus, there is only ONE value that needs to be
published at any given time.

Seting prices based on convenience instead of value derived? *BLECH*. That
sort of thing is anathema to free markets.
