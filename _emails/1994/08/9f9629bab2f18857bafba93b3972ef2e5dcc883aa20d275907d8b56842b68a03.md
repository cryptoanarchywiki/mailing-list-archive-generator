No it isn't. Making a digital cash system secure, scalable and distributed
is a non-trivial task, making it anonymous is still more difficult.
Guaranteeing anonymity creates alot of problems as was brought out in a
previous discussion on license based cash in which it was pointed out
that by colluding with consumers a bank can still "mark" bills.

I am yet to see a single anonymous digital cash system which could not be
implemented more simply if the requirement on anonymity were not made. I
would be pleased to be proven wrong.

What I'm really asking is for an example of this overhead that is being
reduced.

And its going to get more considerable when we have communities of agents
arguing with each other. I think we want to solve the problems created by
these requirements, not shy away from them.
