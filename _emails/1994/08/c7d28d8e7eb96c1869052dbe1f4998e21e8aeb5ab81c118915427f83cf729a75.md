Yeah, and I got a recent report that "Long Lines" and other microwave
tower lines were deliberately routed so as to cross over Indian
Reservation lands in several places. Why? Allegedly because Indian
lands are legally treated as "sovereign nations" and the (purported)
rules against NSA listening could be ignored.

And of course we've all read Bamford's account of the UK-USA
Agreement, in which the UK spies on us and we spy on them, and all the
legal niceties are thus met.

Someday, when many people act as remailers, it won't matter as much.
