Well, I wouldn't want to snort the stuff daily, but its toxicity
has been overrated in the popular press.

Epidemiologic studies of workers [even wartime workers with impressive
body burdens/ exposures] in a number of uranium bomb-making centers have 
found ~ no health effects.

I haven't heard much about Pu-workers.

Groeten,
