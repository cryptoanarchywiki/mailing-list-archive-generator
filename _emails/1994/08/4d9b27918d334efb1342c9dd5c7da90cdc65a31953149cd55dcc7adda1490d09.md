It is perfectly feasable to track all financial transactions in the
U.S., down to the "quarter for a phone call" level, without
eliminating all capacity to use the data or placing more than, say,
another several percent burden on the cost of all transactions. I know
how to architect such a system, and I'm sure that I'm not the only
one. It would be a big job, but not an impossible one, especially not
with modern computer systems. A several percent burden on the economy
would be devistating, but from the point of view of the bureaucrats it
probably isn't such a bad thing. I feel that it is inevitable that the
folks in Washington will eventually come to the conclusion that such
systems are needed -- the boys at FINCEN will start bawling for them,
and the drug warriors will want them, and the rest of us are all just
a bunch of folks who are upset that we couldn't go to woodstock
because we had to do our trig homework...
