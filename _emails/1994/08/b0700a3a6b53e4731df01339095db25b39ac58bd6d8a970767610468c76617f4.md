Maybe not.  NY Times reports today that industry tells Congress 
that cost will be far greater than FBI says, and that big 
subsidies will be needed.

Quote:  The FBI Director, Louis J. Freeh, agreed that it would 
be "very, very difficult" to estimate costs.  "But I certainly 
know what the cost of not proceeding will be in terms of crime 
and destruction," he added.  End quote.

Cost could be the Achilles heel of the bill.

Taxpayers arise, sayeth T. May; and cypherpunks write good 
goad.
