Sigh.  I say "A implies B".  You say, "not A, and so proposition is
incorrect".  In elementary logic, you are wrong.  IF the traffic is
continuous, THEN random delays introduce reordering.  The proposition
is completely obvious.	Do I really have to spell out a trivial
proof?

Under this modified assumption, you must remember that I proposed
that noise packets be introduced to defeat traffic analysis.  The
bursts will be smoothed out.  Not perfectly.

Many of the characteristics of TCP/IP derive from its design being
optimized for speed.  RemailerNet would give less importance to
speed, and more importance to opaqueness to traffic analysis.

Correct.  You assume details that have not been specified, and then
critique them at length.

If a message is fragmented into N packets, and then the dispatch time
slot for each packet is assigned randomly, the packets are reordered.

[Comments deleted ignore the fact that messages are fragmented, and
so are irrelevant.]

His arguments also ignore the fact that reordering messages of different
lengths is useless as a defense against traffic analysis, suggesting that
this is polemic rather than a serious argument.

I say again: reordering is not weak, it is irrelevant if messages are of
signficantly different lengths and are not fragmented.

If by "the above claims" you mean the preceding two sentences, I do
agree.
