DSPs are actually optimized for the operation required in the FFT: integer
inner products.  A DSP will have hardware for extremely fast summations of
expressions like
	    c[i]*x[i]
where the c[i] are constants, and new x vectors are introduced at a high
rate.

This is somewhat different than the kind of fast multiplication you are
looking for.
