I had a funny thought the other day. YES, the remailers have been set up for
foiling traffic analysis and YES they are reasonably secure and YES they
are oriented toward private citizens striving to protect their personal
privacy....BUT:

Wouldn't it be funny, if the CIA (or other agency) used the remailer system
(alon with PGP) for regular communication with operatives overseas. Think
about it for a second...the NSA can't be the only one monitoring Internet
traffic. With that in mind, say the Company had to get a message overseas
to an operative. Probably it would be a bad idea to send a message to someone
overseas with the return address of spooks@langley.cia.gov.us, so why wouldn't
they take advantage of the remailer system?

That way the message (encrypted of course) would arrive in a person's mailbox
from hacktic or wimsey or kaiwan and noone could attach any sort of importance
to it. And because it could be encyrpted every step of the way, noone would
also be able to snoop.

Yeah, they probably have their own exotic encryption systems.....cyphers that
would be a dead give away in the case of an operative getting busted. But
again, PGP being nicely widely distributed, no enemy agency need attach an
identity to a suspect by virtue of his using PGP.

Just a thought and mybe a lame one at that, but what the hell, stranger things
have happened. It would be mildly cynical to imagine the reamailer system set
up to throw roadblocks at the intelligence community was actually being
used by that same entity.
