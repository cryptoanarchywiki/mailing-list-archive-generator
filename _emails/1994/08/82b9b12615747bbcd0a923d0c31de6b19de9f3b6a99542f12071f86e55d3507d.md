I finally got around to reading the text of the counrt papers filed.  
From this came two things:
	A)  The realization that lawyers get paid so much because only 
	    they are politicians are able to bullshit that much :-)

	B)  Utter confusion about what exactly is going on here.

--------------------------

Uh . . . What exactly does this mean?  As near as I can gather, Cylink 
says that RSA has engaged in various forms of unfair business practice, 
but beyond that, I am not sure what issues are at stake, who the "good 
guys" and who the "bad guys" are, and where this will end up.

Is anyone willing to kind of summarize what exactly this is about and 
how the outcome effect the cypherpunk community?  And, to quote a great 
movie, explain it to me like I was a six year old :-)

Thanks.
