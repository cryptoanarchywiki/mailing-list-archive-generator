There might be at least one good reason for NOT going overseas on 
that first leg.  The NSA's charter restricts it to international 
operations.  By making that first leg a foreign one, you've made 
your transmission, the one with your address visible, fair game 
for them.  I don't know how closely they obey the "rules", given 
their inherent lack of accountability, but if you forced them to 
break the rules to monitor you, they might at least be a bit more 
hesitant to use the info against you.
