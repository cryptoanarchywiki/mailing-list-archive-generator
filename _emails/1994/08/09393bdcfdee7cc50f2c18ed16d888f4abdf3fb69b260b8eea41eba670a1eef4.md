I was intrigued by this disappearance, so I sent an e-mail message to
Gunter Ahrendt. Through the joys of time zones, my message this evening was
answered within minutes, from Australia.

He told me the NSA machine remains, though it has been renamed, has been
put under another site, and its performance rating has been recalculated
based on a new metric. Gunter's latest report (in comp.sys.super) explains
the new metric.

Grepping for the name "SMPP," here's where I found it:

58) 16.46 - (APR-1994) [SRC]
        Supercomputing Research Center,Bowie,Maryland,US,root@super.org
        1) Cray 3/4-128 [-4Q96]           11.46?
        2) SRC Terasys                  ~  5
        3) SRC SMPP-4/2M [+4Q96]         503.33?

This is also very intriguing. The machine formerly called the "NSA
SMPP-2/2M" and expected to be located at NSA Central Security Service, is
now to be located in nearby Bowie at the Supercomputing Research Center.

I guess that means the SRC is doing more than just "academic computing"!
