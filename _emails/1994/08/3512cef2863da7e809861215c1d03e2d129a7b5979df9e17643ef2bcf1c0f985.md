I merely wish to spare another generation of kids from 18 years
of grief at the hands of self-righteous power-hungry adult
authority figures.  Not exactly an unreasonable goal.

A generally true, but completely irrelevant statement.

The first paragraph here, although it sounds nice, is completely
obliterated by the second.

It like saying "I'm all in favor of rights for Blacks, but of
course I wouldn't presume to tell anyone else what they can do
with their niggers."

Or "I'm really against anti-Semitism, but I have no desire to
judge anyone elses practices with regard to hiring, housing, club
membership, or whether they would want their sister to marry
one."

Saying you are for childrens' rights on one hand, and then
suggesting that those rights should be completely dependent on
whomever the specific child happens to win in the parent lottery,
is idiotic and useless.

We're talking about Net access here.  How would a law which
guaranteed that to all citizens, regardless of age, threaten you?
