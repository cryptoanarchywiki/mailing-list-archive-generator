I don't mind so much Tim calling someone a prick in public (shit happens),
but I *do* find it ethically objectionable that Tim chose to post what was
essentially private email to the list.  The "instant reply"  feature of
the net tends to sometimes breed poor ethical choices based on anger,
rather than good sense. 

No, Tim, this isn't a flame - just pointing out that to post private email
without permission is rather rude.
