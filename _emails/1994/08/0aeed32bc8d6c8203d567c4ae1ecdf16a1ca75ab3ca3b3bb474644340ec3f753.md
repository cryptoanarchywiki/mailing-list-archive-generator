I think I now understand what it is you're saying.  But the protocol you
describe is merely that of a trusted escrow agent, which is not a 
government.

Governments can sometimes act in that capacity (for example, if you
default on your mortgage, the govt. will hand over your house to the
mortgage holder).   One difference between the government and other
trusted "adjudicators" is that -- and this goes back to an earlier idea
in this thread -- the government has the force of arms to back up its
decisions.  (If you don't make your monthly payment, the bank goes to
the adjudicator [the govt.] who turns over the property to the bank and
evicts you.  If you refuse to leave, the govt. sends men with guns to
your house to force you out.)  Any other agent would need to have some
economic or other pressure it could apply to you to compel you to follow
the "rules" you agreed to.

Without the threat of force, though, this can hardly be called a government.
You're simply taking an existing concept -- that of a trusted adjudicator,
which need have no connection with a government -- and calling it
"government".  This doesn't make it so.  I am reminded of this [Lewis
Carroll?] quote Steve Bellovin posted several months ago:

  ``When *I* use a word,'' Humpty Dumpy said, in rather a scornful tone,
  ``it means just what I choose it to mean---neither more nor less.''

This whole scheme rests on the willingness of relatively large groups to
put themselves under the control and protection of this cyberspace 
"government" in the first place.  I still don't see what the motivation
will be.  What advantage to me will there be in allying myself with this
government, when I could instead choose a particular trusted arbitrator
or adjudicator or escrow agent on a case-by-case basis when and if it's
needed?  How will one of these governments ever acquire the critical mass
necessary to make anyone care what their rules are?

And the question of motivation is central to your conclusion, which was:
