Unfortunately, you seem to have received one of the early drafts of
the Cypherpunk Code; they're easy to spot because a fumble-fingered
editor left out a few words while recopying meeting minutes. The
Revised Cypherpunk Code of 1993 states:

RCC 23.110:
In accordance with the grand traditions established by previous
cypherpunks (RCC 10.100, et seq), any cypherpunk who suggests that
"someone" or "a cypherpunk" or "the cypherpunks" must implement a
new idea shall be required to code the implementation themselves,
on the platform of their choice.

RCC 23.120:
A cypherpunk required by RCC 23.110 to code an implementation may
employ the work of others as a base for their implementation. The
Librarian of the Cypherpunks is authorized to lend the implementor
a copy of _Applied Cryptography_ until the implementation is finished.

Fans of legislative history will remember the passionate debates 
between the theoretical cypherpunks - who stood opposed to any
coerced effort - and the practice-based cypherpunks, who argued that
this re-education effort was required to build the proper [post-]
revolutionary consciousness, particularly in the "why can't someone
else do it for me" climate of the mid-1990's. The debate ended when
Zaxxon, an outspoken critic of the remailers, insisted that all
cypherpunk software be rewritten - twice - to his specifications. The
Cypherpunk Assembly voted 99-0 (1 abstention) to enact the 
"Do It Your Own Damn Self Act" of 1993, codified as RCC 23.110-120.
