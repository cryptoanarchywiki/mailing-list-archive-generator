I'm putting the finishing touches on the perl <--> gnu (gmp) multi
precision package. If any are interested in the source drop me a note
and I'll fire off the source to you... I'm not going to implement the 
lowlevel functions or the Berkeley compatability routines, this is just the 
integer functions...

While playing with this stuff I was wondering if transfering binaries in 
base 36 would offer any compression/mime enableing features, It was the
first time I'd seen something in base 36. Allong these lines would 
base(ASCII) do me a bit of good? guess I've just had too much coffee...

It's not too bad on the preformance thing and looks great for prototypeing
some of these protocols that call for big int's.

At anyrate I should expect my first version ready for public consumption
on monday or tuesday if any are interested....

-Rick
