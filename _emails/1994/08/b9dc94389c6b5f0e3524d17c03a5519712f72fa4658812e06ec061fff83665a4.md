Indeed.  I'd really like to see the wording about how they actually need
 to be paid for: namely, will allowing tariffs to be raised by RBOCs
 count as "paying for it"?

They could spend the money by doing two things:

	- Mandating the money be spent (the DT bill)
	- and then allowing the RBOCs to increase their tariffs.

Presto!  We've paid for the mechanisms, but not through the federal
 budgets.  The RBOCs have been pushing for high bandwidth R&D increases
 of their general tariffs for a really long time, so I could certainly
 see them playing along as long as there's room for other R&D in there.

Just a thought...
