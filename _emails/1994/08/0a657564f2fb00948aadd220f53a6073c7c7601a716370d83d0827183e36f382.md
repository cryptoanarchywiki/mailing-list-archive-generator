I grew up in a small town of 5,000.  It had a city government.	The
county government was in the same town.  No one denies that California
has a government, I think.  And then there was the US government.  And
we had city police, the sheriff's office, the Highway Patrol, and the
FBI paid an occasional visit.

So drop the word 'exclusive'.

In our high school we had a student government.  We had no prisons
and no guns.

You can't simply take over the ownership of words in the English
language.  'Government' is indeed the name used for an entity that
exercises authority or enforces laws.  There can be more than one
government exercising control over the same geographical or political
area, and that control need not be effected with guns.
