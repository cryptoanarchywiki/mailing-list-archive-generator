These facts were well documented.  Child welfare workers visited the
compound and examined the children.  Signs of previous physical
punishment were noted as well as a room devoted to that purpose and
the appropriate paraphernalia.

A doctor at Baylor University Medical Center was asked later why 
this didn't cause the removal of the children, and said that while
such behavior would certainly be considered abuse in a medical
sense, it did not meet the legal definition of abuse according
to the laws of the State of Texas.

Texas, of course, is the leader on the national corporal punishment
bandwagon and dishes out over 250,000 state-sponsored beatings every
year in its public school system.  So far all efforts to ban the 
practice have been successfully opposed by the teachers union.
