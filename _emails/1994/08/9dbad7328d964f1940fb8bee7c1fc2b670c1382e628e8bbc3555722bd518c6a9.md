Then there's this company called, I think, "Wave" Inc. out of Colorado
somewhere.  The first time I heard of it was in Peter Huber's Forbes column
a year or so ago. The guy who's fronting it is a former chairman of a large
defense contractor (United Technologies?).  It involves metering
application software use down to the second, using PC boards and the
internet, or some other WAN equivalent.

A dongle is forever...
