  I have some problems with this: "It is their equipment and you are
working on their time". Govt property is stolen property. To agree
that you are dealing with their property & their time is to confer
legitimacy on their theft.

  I have problems with this: "...and within their rights." The relation-
ship between rights & legal rights of the state is something like that
of turtle soup to" real mock turtle soup".

   I don't wish to flame you, but if we confer legitimacy to the state
thru our common conversation then it will be hard to free ourselves.
