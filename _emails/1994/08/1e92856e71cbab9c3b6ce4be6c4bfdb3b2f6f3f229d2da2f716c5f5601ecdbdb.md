MEETING NOTICE
==============

UniForum Chicago holds its monthly general meeting on Tuesday, August 
16, 1994 at the College of DuPage and everyone is welcome.

This month's speaker is Bruce Schneier, author of APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY,
(B. Schneier, Wiley Inc., 1993).  Quoting the back cover of Bruce's
book:

"The explosive growth of public and private computer networks has resulted
in a tremendous increase in the colume of sensitive and valuable data that
is routinely stored and transmitted digitally.  From computer messages
speeding through global networks to vast sums of money transferred
electronically, the greatest challenge in this new digital world is
keeping this formation out of the hands of unauthorized users who prey
on vulnerable computer systems.

"In APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY, data security expert Bruce Schneier details how
programmers can use cryptography--the technique of enciphering and
deciphering messages--to maintain the privacy of computer data.  Covering
the latest developments in practical cryptographic techniques, the book
shows programmers who design computer applications, networks, and storage
systems how security can be built into the computer software and systems
we use every day.

The meeting will be held at:

College of DuPage

22nd & Lambert
Glen Ellyn, IL  60137
