It's true...  You do not HAVE to give your ssn to anyone other than the 
IRS and your employer...  So many companies have changed their 
proceedures so that credit apps, buyers club memberships, and that such 
stuff, are more of a pain if you do not give your ssn.  They won't make 
you give it, but they will make whatever you want harder to get if you 
don't...
