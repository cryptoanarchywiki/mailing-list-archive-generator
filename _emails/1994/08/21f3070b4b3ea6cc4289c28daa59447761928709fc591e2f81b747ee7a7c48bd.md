Ironical as it seems, this may be a good idea in the near future. Yes, I
know, the climate's not the best, and there's little infrastructure (apart 
from the Trans-Siberian railroad). Additionally, there's a small danger of
being shot by some irritated poachers and lumberers. Finally, I wouldn't
go swimming in the Sea of Okhotsk (sic) unless you are into foraging inside
old decommisioned nuclear submarines....

	But look on the plus side. There's still lots of natural resources
remaining in Siberia. Apart from the massive forests of the Taiga, there 
should be still a plethora of minerals in the ground. The central govern-
ments still pretty weak (well... weaker than it was :-), which should appeal
to the libertarians and minarchists on the list. Plus, the area does have
close proximity to the Asia-Pacific region - there should be some people
interested in investment. As for labor... Well, there should be quite a few 
inhabitants in the Great/Dear Leader's gulags (near Vladivostok) who would
be interested in looking for a quick career restructure.

	Now if they get that Bering Strait railroad tunnel going (in say,
a couple of decade), things should be really happening. Yes, you too can
be a tentacle of Adam Smith's invisible hand! (Sorry, shouldn't mix my
metaphor....:-)
