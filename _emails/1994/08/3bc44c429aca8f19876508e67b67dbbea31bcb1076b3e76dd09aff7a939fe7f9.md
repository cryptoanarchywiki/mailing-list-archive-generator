Ahh. Perry to the rescue. This is even better than being technologically
impossible.  Economic impossibility is *just* as physical (I cite the
failure of command economies like the USSR and Cuba as my evidence) as is
technology, and since we're looking for a business case here, your reply
comes in at the nick of time. One more point for regulatory arbitrage. That
"several percent" deducted from the gross domestic product of a nation
could tip the balance of it's international competitiveness, and could
forgo that country's requirement for trapdoor ecash.  The threat of that
could be enough to shoot down the idea on this side of the American border.

Parkinson's law holds that organizations like bureaucracies tend to expand
to use all their available resourcess. But it's a law of biology that a
parasite doesn't kill its host.

Does your Forbin project above include the ability to store and retrieve
*all*  transactions down to a quarter phonecall permanently?
