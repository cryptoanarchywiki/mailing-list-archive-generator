Plutonium oxide has a reputation for causing eventual lung cancer when
inhaled in microgram quantities.  But if the plutonium metal is sintered
into a ceramic, it's not loose and breathable.  I can't say how
otherwise toxic it might be, but I'd expect it to be similar to other
heavy metals.  So the poker chips sound pretty safe.
