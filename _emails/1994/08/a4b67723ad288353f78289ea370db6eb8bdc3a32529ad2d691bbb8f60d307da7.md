However, NY Times Monday reported in long front-page article on 
spread of digitized forged checks, including dupe of magnetic 
ID.

Quotes:

"The proliferation of desktop publishing has brought a new 
growth industry, the counterfeiting of virtually undetectable 
fraudulent checks, and banks and law enforcement officials say 
the cost to the economy could reach $1 billion this year.

* * *

The American Banking Association says [this] is the No. 1 crime 
problem facing banks.

* * *

It is much easier counterfeiting checks than cash."

End quotes.


Says center of activity is California but has spread to all 
parts of the US.

My standard pitiful offer to send this article upon email 
request.
