I have assimilated criticisms made and modified the proposal.

(a) I don't force the users to trust RemailerNet as a single entity,
(b) how does their trust make it possible for the entity to be
compromised??  It is not possible to guarantee that some or all
components of a remailer network are not compromised.  You can
only take steps which reduce the probability.

It is NOT one entity, is IS a large group of independant (but
cooperating) entities.

In most cases, you do not want the person operating a remailer to
know you personally.  Ideally, you know them, because they have a
widespread reputation (eg, julf@penet.fi).  But they do not know
you.  As a practical matter, the fewer remailers there are, the
more likely they are to have an accurate reputation, because more
people will have had experience with them.

People have been building systems like this, that involve webs of
trust, for millenia.  Banks are such institutions.  While it is
true that familiarity between trusted individuals makes for collusion,
it also makes for knowledge.  Most people use banks.  Few banks
are corrupt.

A cruder example is the dope dealer.  The police regularly attempt
to compromise them.  Anyone buying dope learns to (a) be skeptical
about all dope dealers but also (b) find one that he can trust and
stick with him.

Dope dealers apply the same sort of heuristic to their suppliers.
They ask around all the time, they listen to gossip, they talk to
their peers.

RemailerNet v0.2 allows "empowered users" to participate as
equals with established RemailerNet operators.	This means that
the gateway that they are connected to has no way of knowing
whether they are originating any traffic, let alone who that
traffic is addressed to.  The gateway will know that the user is
receiving traffic, but it will not know whether that traffic is
intended for the user or whether the user is simply acting as
a reflector.

Therefore, two users could communicate through a RemailerNet
network with ALL nodes [gateways] compromised, and still be
secure against most forms of attack.
