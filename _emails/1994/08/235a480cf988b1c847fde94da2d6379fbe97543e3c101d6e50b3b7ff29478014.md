sigh.

Perry was expressing, in his usual intemperate fashion, the
legal philosophy known as "legal realism".  Despite the name
legal realism is quite different from the philosophies of
moderate realism or extreme realism.  It is in fact a form
of nominalism.

Today, any judge who is not a legal realist can look forward
to a career of dealing with drunks in the night court at 
topeka.

Happy now?
