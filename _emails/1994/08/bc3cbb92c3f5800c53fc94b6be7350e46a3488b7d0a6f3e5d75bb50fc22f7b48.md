 I called Dave Lovejoy, a longtime credit manager and currently product
line manager for Data Rental's line of credit retrieval terminals. He confirmed
for me what I had always understood; with _secured_ credit cards, no one
really cares who you are, as you have secured your card with a cash
deposit (typically 110% of your limit) and collection is no problem.

I have no idea as to the legalities of all this.

BTW Data Rentals is one of the major suppliers of credit retrieval equipment
to credit grantors, marketing towards the small-to-medium sized operations
(that is, those who don't buy their reports directly from the bureaus on tape.)
I wrote the software for their DRS-2000 automated credit terminal, as well
as their credit cartridge for the TI 700 printing terminal.
