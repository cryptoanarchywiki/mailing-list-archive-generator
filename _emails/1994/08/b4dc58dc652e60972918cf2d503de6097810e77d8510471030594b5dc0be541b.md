  first of all the only "muslim" (NOT ARAB, NO ARABS HAVE NUKES, the only 
country with nukes in the middle east is Israel) country
with a nuclear program is pakistan, and they're years away from anything
that could be stolen.

second of all there are more deaths caused by lighting on golf courses,
ask any insurance agency.

some call it pork barrel, I call it consperasy theory to protray muslims 
as terroists.
