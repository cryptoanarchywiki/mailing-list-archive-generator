How is this simple?   A credit card company sure as hell wants
to known who you truly are and where you truly live.  It must
be able to collect its debt and mark your credit rating.
Applying for a credit card with false name or Social Security 
number is fraud, with heavy punishments.  Or are there, yet 
again, numerous details you are neglecting to mention?
