There's a difference.  docmaster.ncsc.mil gives guest accounts to all sorts
of private security consultants -- perhaps to dilute/mask any NSA presence.
Everyone I've talked to from dockmaster has been non-NSA.

The answer I was given was that anything coming from a host named "nsa"
would be taken as an official statement from the NSA (remember the alleged
loose cannon who tried to tell the IEEE not to have an international
meeting on crypto?).
