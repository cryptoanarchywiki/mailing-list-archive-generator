Actually, the reverse is true. Pentium integer performance (as
measured in SPECints) is somewhat better than 601 PowerPC performance,
MHz for Mhz. Thus, a 66 MHz Pentium has slightly better integer
performance than a 66 MHz PowerPC. Not by much, but slightly. 

However, 90 MHz Pentium machines are now available in volume, even for
under $2000, while PowerPC is not yet at this level. (Experimental
Pentia running at 150 MHz have been shown..601s running at 120 MHz
have been shown...and both Intel and IBM/Motorola/Apple have newer
designs about to appear--the P6 and the 604.)

Floating point is another story, with the PowerPC 601 significantly
outperforming the Pentium. The exact numbers for all of these
benchmarks are published and republished constantly, so I won't do so
here.

I happen to use Macs exclusively, but I worked for Intel for 12 years
and still own their stock, so make of my comments what you will.
