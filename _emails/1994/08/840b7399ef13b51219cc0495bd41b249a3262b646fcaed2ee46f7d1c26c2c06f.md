|   It's unbelieveable (to me anyway) that people would give this kind of
| information out and trust that it can't be abused. It's bad enough that
| we're asked to hand out our SS number for everything.

It's my understanding that it's technically illegal for anyone to require
your SSN for anything if they are not using it for SS related purposes.
I had heard that congress passed a law when SSNs were issued to this
effect.

Am I hallucinating, or has someone else heard this too?!
