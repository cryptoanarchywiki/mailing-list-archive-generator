I don't think this is really the purist stance. You defined it as 'you are
your key', and my view is that revocation will have to be possible. All
that your argument above is saying is 'email address and claimed name are
insufficient to prove identity' -- surely no one disputes that?

Yes. And physical possession of them is not generally considered to be
unquestionable legal proof that you are the person who originally
owned them.

In all honesty, I don't see physical key theft to be a major problem
for individuals, since it can generally be made unprofitable. Where I
see legal key revocation as essential, is for corporate situations.
That is where a multi million dollar cost of stealing a key could still
be quite profitable. We need to figure a way to extend web of trust to
revocations and corporate identity.

Unfortunately, I think that the courts will expand too. The courts may not
be able to freeze and confiscate your foreign assets, but they may be able
to block you from doing a great deal of business without very frequent
changes of 'name' and reestablishment of reputation. Also, there is always
the possibility of being hampered in the physical world. We all have to
buy groceries, and the physical means of communication will always be
vulnerable to pressure.

This is not to say that I don't think crypto will weaken government. It
will. Making court rulings effective will be far more expensive than it
currently is.
