How about a quote from Vernor Vinge's "True Names" (a must read for any
cypherpunk, happily now back in print):

"Like most folks, honest citizens or warlocks, he had no trust for the
government standard encryption routines, but preferred the schemes that had
leaked out of academia -- over the NSA's petulant objections -- over the
last fifteen years".

This from a book that was published in 1981.
