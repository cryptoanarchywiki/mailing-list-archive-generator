Interesting problem.  The suggestion (by whom?) to use two envelopes is 
useable as long as there is a trusted party involved.  This is very 
similar to the way such surveys are performed in Norway:  Each questinare 
has a random number on top and a trusted party is able to link numbers to 
participants' names and check who has answered and so on.  Researchers 
only see numbers and not names.  The problem is that the trusted party is 
often very close to the researchers using the survey...

Here is a suggestion for an electronic solution based on anonymous 
electronic coins:

You fill in your form and submit it electronically to the survey 
organizer.  The organizer acknowledges your form by giving you a blind 
signature much in the same way as a withdrawal in a Chaumian electronic 
cash system.  Later you unblind the signature and send it to the 
organizer together with name and adress to be registered as a 
participant.  The blind signature prevents linking of your name to the 
returned form but still proves that you have returned a form.

Not directly provided by this simple solution, but the suggestion made by 
Stephen D. Williams to link you and your partner by writing down the same 
random number on the returned forms can be used.  There are other ways to 
link anonymous transfers too, but I won't come into that now...

OK.  They get your name together with the unblinded "coin" to prove your 
participation.

Same as above.

OK due to properties in the anonymous cash schemes.

The problem with this seemingly simple approach is that it requires an 
anonymous online connection between you and the survey organizer.  
Confidential and/or anonymous channels does not seem to be "in" among 
network providers today... :-(
