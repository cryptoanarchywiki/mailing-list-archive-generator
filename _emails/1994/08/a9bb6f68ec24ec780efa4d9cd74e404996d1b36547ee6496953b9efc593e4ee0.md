No. I was not referring to the process (double-entry bookkeeping), I was
referring to the actual name of the account where the principal is held
until it is redeemed.  I liked the name, but I was wondering about where he
got it from, or whether he invented it himself.  If so, how did he arrive
at the name "suspension account", etc.

Right. My use of "immediate and final" comes from Eric (or maybe Perry).

Clearing in this case is when the cash passes from you to me. When I spend
that cash with someone else, and they in turn spend it somewhere else, it's
really clear, because neither one of us can ever trace where it went. For
all intents and purposes, we might as well call the transaction clear at
the time of its execution. Thus it's immediate and final. Just like any
other cash transaction.

Exactly. Though I think it would be worthy of much more than a civil suit.
I expect that criminal charges come into play here. The culprit has been
identified. Out come the gendarmes, or maybe interpol, since he's gone to
Rio.  Catching an international criminal and extraditing him is not new
technology. You don't even need new law.  Just call it (wire?) fraud and
leave it at that. People and businesses have insurance against fraud. I
expect there will be a whole industry popping up after a while on e-cash
loss control and insurance.

Except for where the cash has been double-spent, a very special case,
indeed, the cash has cleared once it's been spent by the person whom you
gave the cash to. It's untraceability clears the transaction.  It's
immediate. It's final.
