But this assumes that commercial remailers will not take in enough
money to keep themselves afloat.  Which could very well be true!

What you describe is a serious problem indeed: in which only a "deep
pockets/government front/whatever" can run a pay remailer and most
free remailers exist on unsecure systems.

But this is the problem, if the remailer operator is just an ordinary
user, he/she may not even know their remailer is compromised, since
there is only so much an ordinary user can do.  You're trustworthy
friends may be victim of a sysadmin who does sendmail logging, etc.
