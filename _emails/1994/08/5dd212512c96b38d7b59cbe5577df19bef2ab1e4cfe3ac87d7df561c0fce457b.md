Oh?  Just wait and see... Now it just has to get past a Republican
 point of order (it breaks the Budget Act) that requires 60%.  Once
 past that, it's home-free.

Even if he can't pass the Crime Bill (which I think is one of the most
 frightening pieces of legislation in a long time: 2nd Amendment right
 to violent revolution aside, it includes a measure which requires
 anybody *accused* of a "sex crime" to be tested for HIV, at the
 alleged victim's demand), think of it as a sort of "Pascal's Wager."

I'd far rather be wrong about this country getting dangerously 
 oppresive than be wrong about it being just fine, business as usual.
 YM, of course, MV.
