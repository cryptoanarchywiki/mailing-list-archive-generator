This is like those recordings while you are on hold that say "your call
may be monitored for quality assurance" etc. - they have to warn you up
front to do so legally.  You then have a choice to use or not use their
system for any communications you want kept private from their perusing
probiscus.

Big difference here - in Hawaii you must put up signs if you have any
video monitoring equipment in or around the common areas, perimeter of the
building etc. informing people that the areas are monitored using video
surveillance etc.  Inside your apartment is another story - over here you
are protected by the Landlord-Tenant code not to mention a variety of
other ordinance.

Surprise.  It is their equipment to do with as they please and if you
don't want to follow along with their conditions of access...  In the
gov't it is literally against the law and considered theft of government
resources (cpu time, equipment (pc, terminal etc.), electricity...) to use
government equipment for private purposes.

This is where PGP on your local machine fits in.  As long as they don't
have your private key and can't capture keystrokes or access your local
machine you can keep your communications private.

Try EPIC, CPSR, EFF for info.
