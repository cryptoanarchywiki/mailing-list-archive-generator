    That makes my day.  The name Schlafly sounds familiar (I don't mean
    Phyllis).  Roger?  Does anyone know a crypto person with this name?

Well, FWIW, the woman who spends most of the year traveling around the
country telling other women to stay home has gained at least a slight
interest in crypto lately.  

The Phyllis Schlafly Report <schlafly@netcom.com> recently posted an
announcement taking an anti-Clipper position and referring to an
online `report' that they've prepared concerning Clipper.  I didn't
see anything to indicate that she'd be interested in going after PKP
however, so Roger is probably a better guess.

I have no idea whether Roger is her son or how similar their political
ideas are.
