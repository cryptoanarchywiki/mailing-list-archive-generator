They have yet to outlaw accomodation addresses, voice mail systems,
answering services, pay phones, the new phone parlors, the new phone cards
(buy one from Sprint inside a Hallmark Card at your local Hallmark store), etc.

It is very hard to outlaw something that everyone has or can easily do --
ie. switch voice, data, or physical mail.  It is currently easier to send
communications than it has ever been.  Mere legislation is unlikely to
reverse this trend.

"So how do you outlaw accomodation addresses, remailers, voice-mail systems,
and private phone switches in *other* countries."
