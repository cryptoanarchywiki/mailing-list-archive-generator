Jason,

There's a thread on the (legal) list Cyberia-L  about the 
privacy of government information and how to legislate the 
rising demand for this data (and parallel 'Net info).

The initial post of the thread is e-mailed your way.

Behold the legal mill of a "nation of laws" finely grinding an 
issue.  Nitty-gritty skill.

The apparatus to legislate, arbitrate and enforce laws of 
"voluntary government" will probably require as many 
bureaucrats, attorneys and LEAs as the present system unless 
there is a reduction in our dependence upon governments of all 
sorts.

But, as Jim Dixon says, the blame-government adrenalin high is 
uniformly distributed.

Something like the DOD's military conversion fund might be 
needed to cure our addiction to government and help us get used 
to the pastoral bovinity of voluntary associations.


John
