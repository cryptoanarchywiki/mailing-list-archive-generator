True enough.  Note that untaxed income is worth almost twice as much as
taxed income.  An efficient market will exert tremedous pressure to shave
even 1% off a price spread.  Income taxation gives us a juicy 40%+ "price"
spread to cut out.  Vast profits.

In a marketing war between private companies and the government in which the
government can't use force (because the contest is conducted over the nets),
the government loses.  It just can't compete.  No value added.
