I should note that this is almost 10 times faster than the Coherent Chips. 
Given that there is no need for interprocessor message passing in the 
DES tests, I rate that this chip could be 20 times faster than the 
earlier design. That puts it at 100 days per DES attack. 

This sounds like a pretty fun machine to get. All of the old vector
performance of the Cray bundled with the fun of the old CM-1/CM-2. 
You could get some _great_ results on specific problems.
