Ah, my Burroughsian hyperbole strikes again... Gotta get that AJ subroutine

One could accuse you wanting to get a "deductable junket" to Europe here
;-), and you might be right about doing it in London, but it seems to me
that to present a xenophobic argument to the American banking community,
it's best do to that on American soil.  Without sounding too parochial,
it's entirely possible to incite greed in the international markets with
leaving home.  I really want to get regulators into the same room, also.
The site I have in mind is six blocks from the Federal Reserve Building in
Boston.  Boston is, you understand, the fulcrum of the universe, even if
the long end of the lever finishes up somewhere about Berkeley...
