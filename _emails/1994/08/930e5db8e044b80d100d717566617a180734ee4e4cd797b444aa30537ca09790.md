That is a rather sweeping statement.  Want to back this up with some facts
and figures from real FPGA implementations?  Certainly the early bit-slice
designs you mention later on did suffer from these problems, but FPGA's
bear little relationship to those rather venerable devices.

Because the FPGA solution is obviously less flexible, but a hell of a lot
faster than software simulation of another architecture.  In this application
speed will win every time.

But this application is NOT building in volume.  And yes, people do still
built multichip CPU's: most traditional supercomputing and mainframe vendors
for a start.  Indeed, I would be surprised if this application didn't design
it's own FPGA (for ease of interfacing with the comms network for a start),
but I'd argue that a SIMD configuration of reconfigurable FPGA arrays (ie.
a fixed array of reconfigurable arrays) would be an awesome system for
many problems that the NSA would deal with.
