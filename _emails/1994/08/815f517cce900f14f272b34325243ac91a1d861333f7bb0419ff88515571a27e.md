There is a Sufi parable about a guy who loses something on a dark
street.  His friend finds him searching the ground carefully at the
corner under a street light.  He asks him what he is doing, and he
explains that he dropped something.  "Where?"  "Down the street."
"Then why are you looking here?"  "Because there is a light down here."
