Yeah.  I can imagine it.  It would be like New York City today where the
tabs are telling us that seemingly half the population is "driving while
license suspended."  <g>

Course the 1st Amend. was specifically designed to eliminate the nasty
British habit of licensing newspapers.  Driving licenses weren't mentioned
in that document.  Have their been any licensing proposals for the
Information Stupor Highway yet?  If the Supremes will let me burn a cross,
isn't it likely that they will let me log on?
