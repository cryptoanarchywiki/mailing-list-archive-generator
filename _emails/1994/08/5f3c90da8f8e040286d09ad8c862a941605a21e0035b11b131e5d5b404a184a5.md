Well, yeah. And this is a service. When individuals exercise their
freedoms, they frequently interfere with other people's freedoms. To
resolve this conflict, it is necessary to "control the actions or the
behavior of" individuals such that they don't interfere with each
other's freedoms. So they enter into a contract with each other
under which this is accomplished, but a contract isn't worth the paper
its written on unless somebody enforces it, so they hire a policing agency,
the government. That agency is providing a useful service.

I don't agree with that last clause.
