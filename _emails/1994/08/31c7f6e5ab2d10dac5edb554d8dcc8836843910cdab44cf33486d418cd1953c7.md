Well, I still don't follow this analogy.  By this reasoning virtually every
commodity that someone is willing to buy and sell is a callable bond.  The
local gold dealer may sell me gold coins for cash, take the cash, put it in
the bank and collect interest, then buy my coins back from me later.  Is the
gold a bond?  Am I "calling in my bond" when I sell the gold to him?  I don't
get it.

Let's see, I'm selling spindles for $2.59 and you come up with a piece of
ecash you bought ten years ago for $1.00, which is now worth $2.59, and I
sell my spindle to you for it.  I deposit the cash in the bank and it's worth
$2.59.  Now who isn't this fair to?  How is it different from you putting
$1.00 into your interest-bearing checking account ten years ago and writing
me a check for $2.59 today, the amount your $1.00 grew to?

Sorry, I guess I'm missing a lot of your points.
