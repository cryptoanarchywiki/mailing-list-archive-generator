I don't see why an offline system couldn't qualify for all of the above.

In an offline system, the underwriter's collateral position can be
monitored by a trustee, which is itself audited also. This takes care of
the contents of the "railroad locker". If the currency is consistently
redeemed without the spectre of double spending, then the reputation of the
currency increases. That should be taken care of with proper fraud
detection and enforcement.

Amen. As I said previously on this list, if I'm an underwriter, and a
legitimate customer comes up to my redemption window with a previously
spent cash, he may be out the money, but I'm out the reputation of my
product.  Prosecuting fraud is the ultimate solution to this problem, but
it's obvious that the above methods make perfect sense to protect the
integrity of either off-line or on-line system.

Thanks, Jim. I agree with Tim. I always learn something when you put
something up.

In particular, I'm now thinking about what happens if the risk of double
spending is small enough to insure against.  That would effectively do what
issuers of credit cards or traveler's checks do when their products are
"double spent". Make the victim whole and run the culprit to ground.  For
credit cards, it's cheap enough (3%) for them to self insure, with a
vigilant enforcement effort.

Unfortunately, there's probably a "frontier" stage at first, where the
currency is more at risk. It is a caveat emptor situation, with Wyatt Earp
for enforcement of the integrity of the underwriter's cash certificates.

The brain grinds away. I hope I'm not stripping gears...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
