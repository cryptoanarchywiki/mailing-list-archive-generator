Yes.  But my initial point was that a check for $1.00 does not constitute
an alternative currency and you do not seem to be disagreeing with this.
'Therefore' if e$1.00 is essentially a promise to pay one US dollar, and
if that $1.00 is on deposit with a bank somewhere, and if that bank will
pay out US$1.00 when the e$ "check" is presented, the Feds will not be
able to prosecute anyone for using an illegal currency.

Yes.  But you must remember my original point.	I think that whether
the $5000 is transferred as greenbacks or as $e is irrelevant, if the
creation of $e is handled correctly.

I think that if you look back through the recent postings on $e, you
will find that in many cases a discussion which seemed to be about $e
is actually about something else.  You could substitute US$ for $e
without changing the substance of the postings.

Every bank in the United States that allows checks to be made out to
cash already does this.

A second point, relating to this paragraph: obviously, a foreign bank
cannot be constrained in the same way to report financial transactions
to US authorities.  We have all heard of Swiss bank accounts.

So I think that if a company issued $e "checks" denominated in US $
and if a foreign bank were willing to pay against the checks upon
demand, then (a) the $e checks would not violate the Constitutional
provisions against alternative currencies and (b) neither the foreign
bank nor the foreign company issuing the checks would have to make
any reports to US authorities.

Our company is a UK company.  We can easily open a US$ account at the
bank down the street.  We could then write US$ checks made out to cash.
Our bank would not object, any more than they already object to the
sterling checks that we occasionally make out to cash.	If the US
government tried to force either us or our bank to file reports with
them, we would simply laugh at the requirements.
