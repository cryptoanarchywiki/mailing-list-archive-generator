This does seem like a better idea, except for one thing:
Everybody has got to trust the Keeper of the Aliveness Info. 
I'm not sure how much of a problem this is, nor am I sure that
the newsgroup method neccesitates any less trust. 
 
But I do think that a system where all trust doesn't lie in any
one entity is desirable, and I think that such a system is going
to have to be decentralized like netnews, rather then centralized
.  The other problem that a centralized system imposes is that if 
the Keeper Of Aliveness Info goes down, everyone is scrambling to
find a new one. This doesn't seem like a major problem, but again, an
ideal system wouldn't have this flaw.
