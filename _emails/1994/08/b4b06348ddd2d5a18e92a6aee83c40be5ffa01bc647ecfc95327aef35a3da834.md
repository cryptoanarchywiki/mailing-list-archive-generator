The code is just by JI, actually. Phil Karn has done a seperate
experimental implementation

Its sufficient for all protocols on which authentication and
encryption have to be done on the link -- things like Telnet, for
example. For things like Email, its not adequite, because the store
and forward nature of the data means that you need authentication over
the data and not over the link.

There is a (moribund) mailing list, swipe-request@cs.columbia.edu will
get you on to it. There is also a successor protocol that has been
developed by the IETF's IPSEC working group, called IPSP, which is
essentially a simplification of swIPe; I'm editing the draft RFCs.
