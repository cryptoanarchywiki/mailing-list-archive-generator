Okay, every 8 hours.  Now we're down to 60 messages - not too different than 
a lively C'punks day. :-)

So instead of one central remailer, we use some number of 'regional' 
listservers (4 remailers, each handling 5 'local' remailers).  Then if one 
croaks, it's a minimal loss to the system.

C'punks remailer was used as a f'rinstance (functionality example).  So 
there's a different remailer mailing list, and a banks remailer mailing 
list, and money provider's mailing list, ad nauseum.  Who cares?  Those 
interested in remailers listen in on the remailers mailing list, and don't 
listen to the banks list, and versey-vicey.
