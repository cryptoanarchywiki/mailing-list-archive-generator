I understand what you are saying, but it is fascinating
that Clinton gets (by inplication) blamed for Iraq and
the war on drugs, when those are both Republican creations.
Granted, Clinton is carrying through on the WOD, but he kind
of has to, considering 'nessessary political games, washinton
style.' Not that I am a clinton fan, I merely like giving
credit where credit is due, and much of this (including, as has
been oft stated here, the beginnings of clipper) belongs to those
12 years of republican mess making that got Clinton in office in
the first place.
