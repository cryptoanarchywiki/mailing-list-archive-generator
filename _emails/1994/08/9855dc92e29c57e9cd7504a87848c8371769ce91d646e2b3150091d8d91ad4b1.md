Yes, in an ideal world.  Each additional remailer introduces another
chance of being compromised.

But in an ideal remailer network operated by real human beings, you cannot
trust the operator.  You would prefer that at least the points of entry
and exit from the network be different, because this decreases the
probability of the message being 'outed' by a very large factor.  If
you are seriously concerned about legal factors, you would prefer that
the remailer gateways be in different legal jurisdictions.

However, if you trust the operator and if this trust is guaranteed to be
continued forever, the ideal number of remailers is one.
