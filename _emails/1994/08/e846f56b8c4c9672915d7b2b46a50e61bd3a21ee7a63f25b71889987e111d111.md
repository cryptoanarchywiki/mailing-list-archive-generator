I am confused by the word "thus".  None of the three things in the CPF
mentioned in the previous sentence (where to find the LEAF, the LCM,
the KF (BTW, I thought the family key was a big secret?)) include the
manufacturer or the data protocols in any apparent way.  Are there more things
in the CPF than the three you listed?

Also, isn't it likely that RCELP will be widely used by all manufacturers
to be compatible with AT&T, so in practice all will use the same protocol,
and so this does not really identify the manufacturer?

As for recognizing bogus LEAF's, this would be only after decrypting with
the family key, right?  This is not supposed to be done routinely, although
it doesn't require access to the escrow database.  It's true that if a
family-key-decrypted LEAF using Blaze's rogue technique "stands out", that
certainly could call unwelcome attention to the users of his ideas.
