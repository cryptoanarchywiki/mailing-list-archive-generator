	But is it not true that the state can simply decide that
anonymous remailers are a nuisance and a tool of criminals and pass laws
making remailer operators liable or outlawing remailers entirely ?
Considering the things that have been outlawed for flimsy reasons in the
US recently (eg assault weapons, some kinds of scanners) I find it nieve
to presume that anonymous remailers will remain legal.  They are just
too much of a temptation to libelers and slanderers, software pirates,
information thieves, blackmailers, extortionists, tax evaders etc.  And
their perceived positive uses so weak by comparision that I predict that
within a very few years providing an anonymous mail service will either
be strictly illegal or require logging of user ID's and screening of
traffic for legality. 

	Wait and see ...
