Non-problem.  Anonymous posters don't propogate any more
disinformation, lies, or junk than "real" posters.  I could post
my kill file for t.p.g in support of this, but I won't.

Anyone who belives anything posted to the net without
verification has only themselves to blame.  A well-known person
posting from a prestigious .edu site has no more authority than
any anon poster.  The credence you place on the content has to be
determined by the posters previous statements.  Indeed, I find
that several people post very accurate and insightful articles in
some groups, but in others their personal biases are very obvious
and their posts are worth no more than the typical TV news "man on
the street" interview.
