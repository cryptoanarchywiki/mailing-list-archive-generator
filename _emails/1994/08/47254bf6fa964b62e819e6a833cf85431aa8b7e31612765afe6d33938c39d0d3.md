  This sounds great, though I am somewhat confused about the mechanism 
and effect... just giving Majordomo a keyset would not (at least to my 
understanding) cure the problem of an??? recipients resulting in new 
an??? accounts.  Perhaps I am missing something fundamental here, but 
what would this buy us?
