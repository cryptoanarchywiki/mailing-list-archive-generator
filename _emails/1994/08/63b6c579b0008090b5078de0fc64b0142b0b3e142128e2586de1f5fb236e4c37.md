Anybody else notice that Bruce Schnier (author of Applied Cryptography)
appears live and well on the Internet ... at least judging from his
recent post to sci.crypt.

He did return my E-Mail admitting to be the author, so it was rather
interesting seeing someone known to us posting. sort of like seeing a
message from Sterling or Gibson (although Gibson isn't connected).
