I don't care to. It is widely known and understood that structuring
transactions to avoid the $10,000 and over transaction reporting
requirements is a felonly. Go and find out why on your own.

My point is that the government doesn't give a flying fuck. They are
simply trying to stop you from playing games. The law isn't like
geometry -- there aren't axioms and rules for deriving one thing from
another. The general principle is that they want to track all your
transactions, and if you make it difficult they will either use
existing law to jail you, or will produce a new law to try to do the
same. Your hair spliting is really completely irrelevant.
