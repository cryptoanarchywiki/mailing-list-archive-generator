Subject: An asshole using PGP
Message-ID: <199408240801.BAA23785@netcom14.netcom.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain



I just received a PGP-encryptd message from Douglas Floyd, just after
explaining carefully the work that's needed to decrypt PGP messages.

I dutifully clipped the article, moved the text into my text editor,
fired up MacPGP, entered my key, etc.

The message was banal, and is included below:

---begin his message---

What's wrong with putting your private key on a UNIX box?

(Obviously, I AM root on the boxes I have the key on, and the boxes
are firewalled to boot.)

---end his message---

There was no need for this to be PGPed, no need even to ask it,
period, as I had already made the point about the dangers being for
boxes one is *not* root on, etc.

I conclude from this that Douglas Floyd is just an asshole. One I
don't plan to ever respond to again.

Only a prick would make a point to send me a PGP message, encrypted to
my published key, only to make such a point.

For some reason the number of fools and lightweights around here has
jumped dramatically in recent months.
