As anyone who has ever sent an encrypted "Really neat program, Phil!" message
to Phillip Zimmerman knows, he doesn't run PGP where he reads his mail.

He has to download messages to decrypt on a local machine.

All of the cute elm/vi/emacs/mh/pine scripts you wanna post won't help
him.

-Bill

(P.S.  Back when he didn't get so much mail, if you'd done the above, you'd 
       get a response in a couple weeks, telling you this.  He mentioned that
       he saw the irony of the situation -- that the inventor of PGP couldn't
       make convenient use of it.)
