It does seem to come down to that though.  I've spent a bit of time
playing with a couple of versions of Montgomery Mult code plus
other optimisations for modular exponentiation.

What works best depends upon the processor (I was doing C with some
inline assembler for the multiply and divide ops).

I remember that one particular approach worked very well on an
HP 9000/730 and was miserable on anything else I tried (Sparc, 80486,
MIPS R3000, 68030).

There's a really nice survey paper by Cetin Kaya Koc (then of RSADSI) 
called _High Speed RSA Implementation_ which describes various 
optimisations. The references in this are also pretty useful.
