I'm sorry, I thought you were talking about posting the encrypted
messages themselves to the newgroup and having the unlocatable remailer
pick out the messages that are supposed to belong to it thus making it
so that NOBODY knows where the remailer is. Clearly this wouldn't scale.
But if we're talking about having some remailers know where the hidden
remailers are and only having the hidden remailers post the information
that allows it to be addressed, I guess there isn't a problem. Sorry.
