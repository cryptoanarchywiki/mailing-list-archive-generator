Yep, there's Privtool for Sun workstations (or anything else that uses the
XView toolkit). It's only a beta at the moment, but I'll hopefully have
time to finish it off before the end of the year, it's available from
ftp.c2.org and ftp.dsi.unimi.it, and the documentation is available on the
WWW at http://www.c2.org/~mark/privtool/privtool.html (I posted that here
and on Usenet a few months ago).
