The last point is certainly not true.  If user X communicates with
service A (a gateway) in one country to purchase something from
service B in another country, X can settle accounts with A anonymously
(say in US$) and then A and B can settle accounts with one another
(say in sterling) openly.

In fact, few Europeans would object to simply trading in digital
money denomenated in US dollars.   No currency conversion is necessary.
Many European companies have US dollar bank accounts because the
banks charge so much money for conversion of currencies.
