While I'm not participating in the "How many..." scavenger hunt, I do
want to make a correction to Ben Goren's comment:

I think the two kids were nymed "Locke" and "Demosthenes." My copy of
of "Ender's Game" is bured somewhere, so I can't check. But I don't
think Diogenes was one of them.

On the scavenger hunt, my high school chemistry teacher once mentioned
the "death of your father." Turned out she had assumed from an
obituary entitled "Timothy May dies" that perhaps my father had died.

Names are rarely unique. But, then, few of us know any of the other
members of the list except by our electronic identities.
