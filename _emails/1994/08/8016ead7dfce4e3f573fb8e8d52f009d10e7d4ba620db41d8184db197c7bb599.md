The NY Times today also reports on the controversial NRO 
headquarters.

Another long article reports on the wiretapping bill.

One quote:

"I'm not a great fan of wiretapping," said Rep. Don Edwards, 
who is a former FBI agent and is viewed by many as a sort of 
civil-rights sentry over the bureau.  "But it's legal and we 
have to take care of it. . . . I don't think there will be 
objections except perhaps from purists who don't like the idea 
of Government listening in on conversations."

End quote.
