You have proof that you sent funds to the stated account. Presumably,
if you are sufficiently interested, you would have a contract with
your vendor, signed by them, stating that they wanted to be paid that
way. If for some reason that was not possible or insufficient, you
could use a mutually selected agent and an excrow account of some
sort.
