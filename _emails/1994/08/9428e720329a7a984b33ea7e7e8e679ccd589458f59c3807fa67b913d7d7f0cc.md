I'm working (with very low priority, unfortunately) on a sendmail hack
that spools mail (instead of bouncing) if the mailbox write fails.
This will be intended for a secure mail system that I'm working on
that uses CFS for its storage.  Stay tuned...

Another potential problem with sendmail->cfs interaction is that
CFS doesn't implement NFS file locking.  This isn't much of an issue with
a single host and a single instance of CFS, but could be a problem if the
mailboxes are read and written by other machines or are remotely mounted
by the machine running sendmail.

By the way, another mode of operation you might consider is to use a
"permanent" key (that you supply at boot time) for the spool directories
and a temporary key (assigned randomly by the machine at boot time)
for temp files that have only local significance but that may have 
sensitive data.  /usr/tmp points to /crypt/tmp on my machine for this
service (do a cmkdir and cattach at boot time. You also have to hack
cfs to make /crypt/tmp be mode 777).
