Easy: you and your partner each write the same large random number on the
inner envelopes...

Even if there were collisions, it wouldn't affect statistical results.

Multiple partners could be handled this way.
An auditing agency could be hired to do the envelope opening.

An electronic version of this should be easy, but the envelope
scenario is a good description of the idea.  (To the non-cryps.)
(Funny recycling of crypts gang name...  Who are the Bloods? Gov?)
