I personally know individuals that are avoiding medical care because of
concerns about confidentiality. It seems the loopholes are extending.
Patient records stay around for years. Who knows what the requirements will
be five years from now? It would not surprise me if individuals who have
been seeking drug treatment within the last, say, five years would have to
be reported to the Klinton Kommunal Kare agency.

To be examined by the above supervisory agency upon "reasonable suspicion",
no doubt.
