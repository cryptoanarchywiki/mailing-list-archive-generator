     Yes, but as my package stands, it will compile on most systems and 
anybody with a passing knowledge of sendmail.cf, aliases, or .forward 
files and knows the location of their mailer can install and run it.  PGP 
has been through so many changes, I'm just waiting until I can find a 
version that I can (1) run for a while without becoming outdated, and (2) 
use on my system without having security risks all over the place.  I 
will *not* customize my software to work with PGP.  I will make it work 
with encryption, but I'm not going to make it do anything different for 
PGP than for any other mail-processing software.

     If anyone has the time and the inclination to monkey with the code, 
it's available via anonymous FTP from chaos.bsu.edu:/pub/development.  It 
is named something like remailer-current.tar.gz.  Remember, this is C 
code, I don't waste RAM and CPU cycles running PERL on my system (no 
offense intended to those who use it.)
