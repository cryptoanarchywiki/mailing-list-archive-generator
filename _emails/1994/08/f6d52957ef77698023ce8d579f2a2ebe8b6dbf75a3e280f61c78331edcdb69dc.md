In the protocol I describe, S is obviously a trusted escrow agent, (well an
escrow agent anyway, sufficiently distributed secret splitting can eliminate
the trust requirement) but P is very definitely a government like
organization. P is making, monitoring and enforcing resrictions on the freedom
of its citizens. Its entire purpose is to create law and make sure that
you follow it. It just isn't able to fall back on physical force.

Please note (and this is VERY important) that the government and the
adjudicators in my model are NOT the same The are fulfilling very
different functions. The adjudicators are handling disputes, the
government is restricting its citizen's freedom.

Indeed it is. Without societal changes most Americans would blindly walk
from the restrictive government of the physical realm into the open arms of
governments in cyberspace. Getting many people to actually exmine the
economic benefits of the existance of government would be a major step
forward.
