In the interest of spam-less info citations, please check out the posting
in biz.comp.services for "Internet Shopkeeper", which allows people to set
up their own internet malls (mini-malls already???), not just buy a shop in
someone else's mall.

No mention about transaction security in their post, really.

I have a copy if anyone misses it.

When I get some time, I'll put on my dumpster diving outfit and see what I
can find out.  If you get there before I do, share all...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
