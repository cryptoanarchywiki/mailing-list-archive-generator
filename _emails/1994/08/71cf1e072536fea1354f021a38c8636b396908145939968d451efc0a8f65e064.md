(As I said in another post, Netcom has a seriously broken mail system.
Sorry for the delays.)

I'll try to only respond to a few of Hal's good points, so as not to have
too long a post here. His points are elided unless included.

Yep. part of the reason I dubbed it the "Thunderball" plan: in that movie,
almost 30 years ago, a stolen nuclear weapon is armed by spoofing the
retinal scanner with a stolen eyeball (or maybe it was fake contact
lenses...it's been awhile). Given the stolen nukes theme, it's amazing that
the debate has shifted so little in 30 years. (ObCrypto links: Gus Simmons,
who most of you should know about via his "Contemporary Cryptology" book
and his work on subliminal messages, was the *main guy* on the "Permissive
Action Links" (PALs) used to secure American nukes. I asked Whit Diffie, a
close friend of him, if it was true that Simmons and others leaked security
info to the Soviets to help them to secure their own nukes against
unauthorized use...apparently they did, with the approval of the U.S.
government.)

As I remember the observer protocol (Chaum's "Scientific American" article,
August of 1992, as I recall), a trusted manufacturer is needed.
Tamper-resistant modules, etc. This still allows spoofing. I know that
off-line clearing, in which I get my money at some time after the
transaction, is a whole lot less satisfying that receiving confirmation
from my own agents/bankers that the money has already been transferred into
my account.

I agree that various protocols will exist, at various prices, with various
benefits.

Which a free-market person such as Hal agrees with, of course. The market
will ultimately evolve various protocols. Provided that regulations do not
stop certain approaches, of course.

The plethora of financial instruments, derivative, etc., will be echoed
with digital money (indeed, some existing instruments already overlap with
digital money, albeit not yet of the Chaumian flavor). For example,
traveller's checks evolved to fill a niche for a form of money which could
be "lost or stolen" and yet still be replaced. Don't leave home without it.

Lots of niches exist, and many new ones will be created.

We agree. Protocols I've seen make off-line cash problematic. "There is no
digital coin." But on-line cash can be, and hence will be, issued to
anonymous recipients. It's already done, with numbered Swiss bank accounts
(at least in the past), and with the train lockers I mentioned. People put
money in train lockers anonymously, then give the key to others, in
exchange for goods and services (drugs, return of kidnap victims, etc.).

Yes, it requires an infrastructure. But for reasonable-sized transactions,
the few cents for a current VISA transaction would be lost in the noise.
Even if more computations are needed (as they will be, presumably), on-line
transactions will be manageable for the larger transactions. Very small
transactions (buying snacks and newspapers) can be handled off-line. This
is already done, as when people buy "subway cards" that are
semi-tamper-resistant (we all know they aren't, but most people don't try
to diddle them). Ditto for phone cards, parking coupons, etc.

(But why bother with off-line cash for most purposes? Physical cash is
convenient for such things. However, markets will decide.)

I look forward to hearing these comments. Understand that I wrote that
essay basically off the top of my head, pulling together some ideas that I
think have been pretty obvious for a while. We don't often discuss these
sorts of ideas, preferring (I guess) to correct each other on points of
trivia about the flight range of the A-10 Warthog (;-}). Life on the
Internet.
