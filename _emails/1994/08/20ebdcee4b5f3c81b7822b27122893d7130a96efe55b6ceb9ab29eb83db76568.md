Forgive my casual use of the English language.	"A may send from a very
large network and forge his or her TCP/IP or Ethernet source address.
But if B is on the same network, he or she can build a table ..."

The size of the source network is related to the difficulty of
determining which machine is forging addresses.  If you are ... sorry,
one is on a large network, forgery without detection is much easier.

Assuming idiocy on the part of correspondents may make for easy
and fast responses, but it injects an undue amount of noise.
