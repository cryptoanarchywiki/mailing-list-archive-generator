If you mean the transaction that occurs between the net as a whole and
underwriter. I agree. There may be lots of non-trivial transactions on the
net in the meantime, however. Nevertheless I'll keep using "suspension
account" until I'm disabused of it, for lack of a more descriptive word,
than for anything else.

As an aside, most finance professors consider accounting to be applied
finance. I expect that accountants don't take to that kindly, however.

"Float" reminds me of "kiting checks", for some reason, so I'm glad not to
use it now.

Cheers,
