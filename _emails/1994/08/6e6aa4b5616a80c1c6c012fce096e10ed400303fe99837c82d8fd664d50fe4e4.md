Chain is one such DOS program for chaining remailers [available on a 
c-punx site near you :-)].  It needs to be fed a file called chain.ini 
which is just a list of remailers with stars in front of the PGP-capable 
ones.  I was grepping Matt Ghio's automagical remailer list and just 
editing it down to the list of remailers (and adding stars) after putting 
the public keys on my keychain.  

I very much appreciate the service he has been providing.  Thanx Matt.
