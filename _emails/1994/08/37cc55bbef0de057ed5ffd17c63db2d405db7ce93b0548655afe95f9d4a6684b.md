I think that you want at least three levels in this system, with
increasingly strong requirements as you go up the levels and
(necessarily) increasingly weak security as you go down.  You
should be able to pop messages into the system from any terminal
anywhere, just using ordinary email.  But you should also be able to
casually dump a few hundred megabytes into the system without making
too big a splash, if you have the right equipment.

Ideally, the empowered user's (your term, yes?) system is functionally
a gateway, but it has a nice front end on it, something like Mosaic.
It is probably a single user system with a RemailerNet interface bolted
on to it; it probably runs under Windows; it may even be a modified
version of Mosaic.

The system at the next level up is a workhorse.  Its user interface
would be a system manager's, designed to show him how traffic is
flowing, highlighting bottlenecks, etc.  It would be designed to run
automatically.
