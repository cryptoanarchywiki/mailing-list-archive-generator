I suppose it's obvious that I was not talking about the present, but future
information society, a world where digital signatures and encryption are as
familiar as combination locks and safes are today. I think it would be
reasonable to assume a fair degree of knowledge on security on the part of
system administrators - if by that time it's not widely known that plaintext
or simple protection (un-shadowed passwords etc) can, like master locks, be
'picked with ease,' then all our efforts towards greater awareness of 
privacy and security would have failed.
