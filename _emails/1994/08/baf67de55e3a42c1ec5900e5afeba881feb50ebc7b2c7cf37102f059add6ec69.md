The "Nova" PBS is tonight, at 8 p.m., repeating "The Codebreakers."

On Channel 9, KQED, in San Francisco, and maybe elswhere...depends on
when your area shows 'nova."

I only mention this because last time it was on, a bunch of folks
asked if anyone could send them copies, so there must be some
interest.
