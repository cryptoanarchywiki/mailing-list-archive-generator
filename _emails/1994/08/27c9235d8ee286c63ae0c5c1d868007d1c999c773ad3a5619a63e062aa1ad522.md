No.  Tim says:

Don't do what I do, do what I say.

Do your homework.

Clean your room.

You embarass me.

Get a job.

Get a haircut.

Get a life.

Don't talk back.

When I was your age . . .

Listen to me . . .

Shut the fuck up.

I'm sorry, I love you.

Every parent of rambunctious kids talks like this.

Sigh.
