You made a claim concerning our judicial and legal system,
a claim so far out of contact with reality that nobody can be bothered
to refute you.

Any judge who thought of the law the way you think of it is going
to be doing traffic cases, beggars, and prostitutes for the rest
of his life, assuming he is going to remain a judge.

Indeed even to become a lawyer one of the requirements is that you
can cite certain infamous judicial interpretations with a straight
face.

(None of the above statements should be read as implying that
Perry has ever been right about anything.) :-)
