    Phonostenography is an ancient system of fast writins, that 
gives one the  ability to classify, anatlize, and synthesize 
information for all languages.  The course consist of 30 
lessons.

    During the frist lesson, the 9 basic movements will be 
taught. These  movements are casily memorized. Then 12 hours of 
instructional theory relative  to sound and stress will be 
given. The remainder of the course will be used to  fine tune 
the okills learned, also,computer cleboration of 
phonostenography  gives one the opporunity to leurn this new 
technology at one's convenience.

    During the two month course, the principle of the 
confluence of symbols  will be brought to perfection, along 
with a unified method of recording  appliable to all languages 
in the world including Japanese and Chinese.

    Phonostenography gives one the ability to sond and receive 
many knids of  information.

    Phonostenography is similar in appcarance to a cardiogram 
and it's advan  tage to the user is that pen and paper are in 
continious contact throught out  a sentence.

    The developen of phonostenography will assist firms and 
individuals in  the utilizution of this new technology.
