It is certainly better than anything we have now.  One nice thing about  
your idea is that it can be brought online in steps.  It doesn't require  
all remailers to suddenly switch over to using alt.anonremailer.net.

Any of the "ping" mechanisms you mentioned would work (some better than  
others).  There's no need to limit the "ping" to a single mechanism.  The  
"I am here" messages could have a field indicating the different "ping"  
mechanisms the remailer supports.  Again, this could start out to by a  
NULL field, and could be added to incrementally, as remailers get more  
sophisticated.
