That reminds me.  I once got a conference announcement from Europe
in the mail.  Printed on the envelope was a little icon showing a
profile of the head of a guy wearing a hat (like a policeman or 
mailman's hat), and an arrow pointing from about his eye level to a 
picture of an open envelope.  This looked like the original envelope, 
untouched, and the icon seemed to have been there from the start.

Anybody know what it means?
