Hmmm:

"Dear Sir;
     Here at the NSA, we take National Security very seriously. Persuant
to USC 422.932(b), we can pluck out your fingernails for releasing
information about our computer resources. Please remove all information
and references to and about the National Security Agency from your
listing. 

               Sincerely,
                    Sue D. Nym, Agent at Large"

True, this is an OBVIOUS spoof, but the point is still there....
