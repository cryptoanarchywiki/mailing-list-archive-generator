C'punks,

I have completed my journey across the continent and am now ensconsed in 
the Greater Gotham Metropolitan Area.  I can still be reached at all my 
old e-mail addresses (ain't technology great?).

Last night, Duncan, his wife, Lois, and I enjoyed a fine dinner in "the
Village" with Heroes of the Revolution, Matt Blaze and Eric Hughes.  The
food was good; the waitress was cute; maybe this East Coast thing will
work out. 

Duncan and I will commence the Privacy Seminar sometime next week, or as 
soon as I overcome truck lag.  (Hey, you try driving 3,000 miles {5,000 
kilometers for our non-US list members} sometime.  It's exhausting.)


 S a n d y
