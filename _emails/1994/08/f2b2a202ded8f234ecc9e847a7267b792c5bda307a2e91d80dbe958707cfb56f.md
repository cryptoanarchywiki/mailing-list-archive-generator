	 Two lawsuits were recently filed in federal court, northern district
	 of Calif, which may cripple Public Key Partners.

	 Cylink v. RSA Data Security, C-94-02332-CW, June 30, 1994, San Fran.
	 It alleges that the RSA patent is invalid.  RSA Data had denied Cylink
	 a patent license.

This one is really fascinating -- Cylink is one of the owners of PKP, along
with RSADSI...
