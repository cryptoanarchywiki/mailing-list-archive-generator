Yes - and implemented a GSS-API mechanism.

The relationship between GSS-API and a general crypto interface is
contentious - as the interfaces to "export" a key for a remote principal
(cf ExportKey and PubExportKey in the draft FIPS) resemble the GSS-API
context initiation interface (cf gss_init_sec_context in RFC 1509), but
have more assumptions about the possible KM (key management) protocols
than GSS-API - or at least only make explicit provision for X9.17,
D-H, and RSA.
GSS-API has been implemented over Kerberos, DASS, KryptoKnight, DCE1.1,
SESAME, and possibly others I haven't heard of. Also, discussions for
an extension of GSS-API to layer over PEM/PGP were kicked off at the last
IETF to enable mail-enabled applications to be linked in to easily consume
authentication and key management services. Hence GSS-API is somewhat
proven to be KM-mechanism-independent.

There is a potential relationship between this export/import class of
interface and the IPSEC packet format (now - or soon to be? - documented),
and ongoing IETF IPSEC WG discussions re KM.
Specifically, it would be helpful for fast implementations (in both senses)
if as much of the processing of IP security could potentially be handed off
to hardware-implemented routines via common KM-mechanism-independent and
algorithm-independent interfaces (which, based on the NIST proposal
primitives, would be [Pub]ExportKey/[Pub]ImportKey, Encipher/Decipher, and
GenerateDAC/VerifyDAC).
If the right interfaces are standardised in h/w crypto, perhaps little other
than negotiation and SAID handling need usually be in software.
