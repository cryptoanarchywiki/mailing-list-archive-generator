I just tried firing up the FTP server in NCSA Telnet, and then accessing it
via Fetch (an FTP client), all on my home Mac.  Various error messages when
I quit one or the other app, but IT WORKS when MacTCP is set to LocalTalk,
or set to PPP *and* I'm dialed into my "provider."  However, doing it with
PPP running, no packets seem to go across the modem.

Yo babes lookit me truckin' now.

I'm told MacTCP doesn't use the standard Berkeley sockets calls.
Is this true?  Is there a library to translate?

It is said a Shao Lin priest can walk through walls.
Looked for, he cannot be seen.
Listened for, he cannot be heard.
Touched, he cannot be felt.
