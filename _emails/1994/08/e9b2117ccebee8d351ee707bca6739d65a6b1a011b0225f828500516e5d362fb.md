Thanks.  I send e-mail to the digicash.support.nl with no luck.  After you
responded, I was interested enough to web out to them until a core dump
dropped me back to reality.  I FTP'd some of their promotional stuff including
Chaum's articles.

For the most part I have been lurking and thought e$ would be nothing more
than a pipe dream, until I saw the beta testing msgs.  Now I am a little more
interested and I am looking for any and all additional research I can find.
 
I think it would be kinda nifty to come up with some kinda' experimental
beta test here in the States.  I'll do some headscratching and see with
what I can find out.

I will CC relevent messages to the list.

Only, any system I develop would have to have a centralized database
to prevent double-spending and fraud.  I don't quite understand how
they are going to work around such a problem, and I can probably
surmize why the total lack of response from them.
