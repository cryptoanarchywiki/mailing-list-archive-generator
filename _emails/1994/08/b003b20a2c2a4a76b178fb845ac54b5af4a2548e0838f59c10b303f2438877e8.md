	If you would actually *read* the deferral messages you
received, they would have told you that the UCB CS Department is
moving to a new building and a number of cs computers (including
soda.csua.berkeley.edu) will be down for a few days, and mail directed
to that computer will be held on campus until the computer is back up
for delivery in a few days.
