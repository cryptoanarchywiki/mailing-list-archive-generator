I got the following in e-mail from a law professor (shall we call him/her
"Professor Vinnie"?) who wants to remain nameless for some reason...
Somebody should teach "him" how to use a remailer, eh?  This person is
emblematic of all the usual interface problems with spiffy new stuff... Oh
well. The posting is late because of the time took me to get permission.
They should be a little faster next time. Here's what s/he said:

After I got this, I asked "him" to reply directly to the list, and "he"
replied declining to do so, the following is the only part of "his" reply
that is relevant to the above.

>I should warn you again:  I'm an administrative lawyer.  The 'research'

Great. We've got ourselves a lawyer in the loop who'll help us talk about
this stuff. I fingered "him" <fingering a lawyer?> and "he" looks real to
me.  Guess I have some reading to do about this anonymity stuff, eh?

Anyway, it's real nice to have another pair of (trained) eyes looking at
the problem.

Cheers,
