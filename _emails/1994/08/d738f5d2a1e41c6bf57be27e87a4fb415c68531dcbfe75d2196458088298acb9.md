Perhaps my use of terms was insufficiently precise.  Bearer bonds do not
actually represent money in the same sense that a check does.  Their value
[usually] fluctuates.  They are a different kind of financial instrument.

Hmmm.  Neither of the types of financial transactions that I listed
is anonymous.

If A writes a check to 'cash', pays B with it, and B passes it on to
C, and so forth, are you saying that this is or will one day be illegal?
