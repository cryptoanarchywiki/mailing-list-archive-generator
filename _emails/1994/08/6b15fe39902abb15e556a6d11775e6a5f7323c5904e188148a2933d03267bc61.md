According to published reports, such as Bamford's "Puzzle 
Palace", NSA does not have a "charter", in part because the 
originators intent to avoid limitations on operations.  The CIA 
has a charter like you suggest.

If you have a public reference on *any* limitation of NSA's 
operations please post here or send by email.

Thanks.
