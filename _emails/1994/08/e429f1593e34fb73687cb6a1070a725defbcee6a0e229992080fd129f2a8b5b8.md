Here's an interesting idea...

Assume we create the alt.anonremailer.net newsgroup mechanism that  
Jonathan Rochkind recently suggested (and it worked).

Could we then not use the newsgroup, in combination with a net of  
well-known remailers, to give us the capability to have some remailers at  
unknown locations by having some remailers post encrypted reply blocks as  
their "addresses"?

Just a thought,
