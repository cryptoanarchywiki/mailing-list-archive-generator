Probably more than any of us want to pony up. My 1990 almanac lists a
1987 estimate of Oregon's population at 2.7 million people, 20 % of whom
were below the age of 15. Let's triple that and assume that 60% of the
population doesn't have a driver's license (overgenerous, I think) - 
and let's assume that you form a nonprofit (to get cheap postal
rates), and you pre-sort your mailing, and you use cheap stationary,
such that each piece costs you only $.20 - you're still talking about
a $216,000 mailing. 

It's a good idea, though; I for one am sympathetic to the cause, if
not this particular implementation. Actually, there's no reason that
the Oregon Privacy Institute (which I just made up on the spot :) 
couldn't hold a press conference in a room with stacks & stacks of
flats of envelopes, and announce that the mailing will take place
soon .. :)

Thanks for inspiring me (an Oregon resident) to get off my butt and
write to my state representative. For what it's worth, it is possible
to ask the Oregon DMV not to release your records - I've done so,
but don't know if I'm on the CD or not.
