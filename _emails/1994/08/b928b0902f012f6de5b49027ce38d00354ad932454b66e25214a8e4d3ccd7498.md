My guess, and this is only a guess, is that it disappeared for "security"
reasons. They have a habit of keeping the smallest bit of light from
emerging. For instance, no one knows the "Black" part of the budget. It's
classified. But you can take the total budget amount and subtract the
non-Black section and get the result. They make you do the math.
