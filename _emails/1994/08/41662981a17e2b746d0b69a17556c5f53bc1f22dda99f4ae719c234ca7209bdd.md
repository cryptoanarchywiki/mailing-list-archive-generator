jdblair is pointing out that the women in the movie are sexually
objectified, reduced to objects without minds.

This is unrelated to 6).  'Monkeywrenching' is the practice of
sabotaging 'the system' so that it won't damage nature, usually.  In
this case, it's more likely that he's talking about sabotaging the
government.

The term is named after the Edward Abbey novel _The Monkey Wrench
Gang_, in which a group of people go around destroying heavy
machinery, bridges, billboards, and so forth, because they are
damaging the environment.

I think the conspiratorial atmosphere tends to attract men more than
women.  That's why there are so few women, IMHO.

I think you've misinterpreted it.
