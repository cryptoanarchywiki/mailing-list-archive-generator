If you look at the history of the Internet, there have been some free
Internet services, but the ones that have thrived have been paid.
(If the government or your school subsidizes your Internet access,
it may appear free to you, but the staff all get their paychecks every
month.

If it is built like the Internet, it will do just that.

There are two things being blurred together here which should be kept
distinct.  The first is gateway-to-gateway announcements.  The second
is advertising of the RemailerNet gateways to the wider world.

Generally I would expect gateways to introduce themselves to one
another privately and negotiate an understanding.  Part of this will
normally take place off the Net.  This is an infrequent event, and
so can be time-consuming and expensive.  The basic web of trust is
that between gateways.	Once gateways had entered into a relationship,
there would be frequent encrypted private traffic between them
which would maintain the trust.

Gateways can also announce their presence to the wider world, and
publish their public keys.  This could be done in alt.RemailerNet or
it could be done in alt.internet.services, or any of several other
places, or all of these.  Any information published in alt.RemailerNet
would be suspect, because it could be a complete fabrication or it
could be a modified version of the correct posting.

Gateways could be started up by anyone and some postings to
alt.RemailerNet would be spurious.  The "gateway" could be a sink,
just tossing traffic sent to it, or it could copy all messages to a
TLA before forwarding them.  The user-gateway web of trust would
therefore be far more problematical. I think that this would function
as a market, and unreliable and untrustworthy gateways would be driven
out over time.

At the same time, there would be a constant bubbling up of new
remailer networks, because the software would be freely available
and the protocols well defined.  The longer lasting gateways that
proved trustworthy would in time join established networks.

Compiling a list of remailers, sure.  But if you let the user control
how messages are chained, you are inviting real traffic analysis.  The
user should only be able to specify his destination and the level of
security desired.

If the newsgroup is used as described above, RemailerNet itself is not
threatened; it is only the users that can be spoofed.  This level of risk
is unavoidable.  But gateways would never use the newsgroup for
inter-gateway communications, because (a) it would be redundant (they can
talk directly once they know each other and (b) you would have to assume
that anything posted to a newsgroup had been compromised.

Well ... if you follow this line of reasoning too far, you are just
saying 'nothing can be trusted, so don't bother being careful'.  If I
were running a remailer and someone posted his address in a public
newsgroup and said "hey, here I am, and I run a really good remailer"
I wouldn't trust him just because he signed it.  I would get in touch
with him, ask around about him, maybe run some low-security traffic
through his remailer for a while.  Then after some time I would raise
my estimate of his trustworthyness.  If he dropped traffic, if someone
reported that something that they had sent privately had been
compromised, I would drop him.

You already use the SMTP RFCs to exchange information -- this message
comes to you courtesy of those RFCs.  Email can have very complex headers
and they can be in pretty much any order. This makes it difficult to write
email software.  I am simply suggesting that we allow only the minimal
few headers, with possibly a few added to support RemailerNet protocols.

ASSIGNMENT OF ANONYMOUS IDs

These types of traffic are possible, where 'known' means your ordinary
email address:
	    known   --> known
	    known   --> anon
	    anon    --> known
	    anon    --> anon

There should be two anonymous IDs, one for sending, one for
receiving.

I assume that anonymous IDs are never assigned automatically.  If you
want an anonymous ID pair, you ask the gateway for one, possibly
enclosing your public key encrypted with the gateway's public key.
The gateway returns your new IDs, encrypted if you you gave it a key.

The 'send' anonymous ID is used for sending messages from someone
else's account.   The gateway converts it into a 'receive' ID before
forwarding your message.

The 'receive' ID appears on your email after it goes through the gateway
and can also be passed to other parties who want to send you remailed
messages.

Additional security can be added by using a digital signature.	The
gateway could be instructed ignore messages lacking such a signature
or to take some specified action.

ELECTRONIC CASH

Ecash is easily added to such a system.  'Emints' would generate a
message containing a bank identifier and an encrypted value.  This
would be the ecash.  It could be given to anyone or anything.
Messages containing ecash would be encrypted.  The emint would
credit the account of the first person to present it, and would
bounce any copies presented subsequently.  Giving change would be
trivial.
