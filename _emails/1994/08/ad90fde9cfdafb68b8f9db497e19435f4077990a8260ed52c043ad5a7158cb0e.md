Jason's use of the term 'tax' in a special sense is no more an abuse
of the language than the attempt to change the conventional meaning
of the word 'government'.  He says that institutions like MIT govern
the behavior of their special populations, that they can impose levies
on their users, and that they can enforce rules against their users
without the use of physical force.

You can walk away from almost all US taxes by walking away from the
USA.  I have.

What about luxury taxes, fishing licenses, flying licenses, and so
forth?	If you insist on calling these 'market prices', you begin to
really rip the fabric of the language.
