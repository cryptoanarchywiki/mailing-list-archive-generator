PowerPC integer performance is rather impressive, i.e. faster than
Pentium by a bit. One craveat, tho, Apple says "No!" to programming in
assembly, and I doubt that IBM is all this happy about it either. My
guess is that MacOS is approaching the Unix "distribute source, 'cause
you're gonna have to do lots of re-compiles" type of thing. Just a
guess, though. Anyway, there is one assembly interpreter out for
PowerMacs, I don't know about the IBM PowerPCs, though.

Back to lurking,
