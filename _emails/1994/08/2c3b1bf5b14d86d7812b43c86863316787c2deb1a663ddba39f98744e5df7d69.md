Perhaps.  However, there is much detailed design and production 
info in the "Nuclear Weapons Databook" series:

     U. S. Nuclear Warhead Production, Volume II, 1987.
     U. S. Nuclear Warhead Facility Profiles, Volume III, 1987.
     Soviet Nuclear Weapons, Volume IV, 1989.
     And others.

The series provides pretty detailed textual and graphic 
descriptions of the entire history of design, production, 
testing and deployment of nuclear weapons. 

These are written by the folks at Natural Resources Defense 
Council and are available there and from Ballinger Division, 
Harper and Row, New York.

The beloved McGeorge Bundy is quoted on the covers:

"A powerful antidote to the simplistic deceptions peddled with 
such zeal from high places . . . contains more facts about the 
past, present and future of [U. S. nuclear] forces than have 
ever been put in one place before . . . meticulous and 
responsible . . . the effect is overwhelming."

They are mesmerizing.  But then maybe they were written only 
for the ignorant.
