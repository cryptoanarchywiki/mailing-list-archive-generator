I was just reading through my mail when it hit me. If the NSA and the FBI 
want to put their software based key-escrow systems into software like 
Chicago, why don't we create pamphlets to send out to businesses and the 
people of the United States. In the pamphlet, there is a little glossary 
for some of the terms and acronyms used and explanation of the Govt. 
would like to do with Clipper Chip and YOUR phones and computers. Or we 
could try another route. Most radio stations and TV stations give groups 
free air time for public service anouncements. We could create videos 
about what we are talking about to make the public aware....
