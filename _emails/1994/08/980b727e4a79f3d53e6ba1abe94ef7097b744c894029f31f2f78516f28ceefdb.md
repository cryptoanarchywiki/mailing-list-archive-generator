   I suspect that MIT's security forces, even though it is a private school,
   hold 'peace officer' ratings and this implies that they can carry weapons
   at any time (though they don't usually). 

They're armed police; I've never seen a one without a gun.  MIT's CPs
(Campus Police) were kind enough to put their pamphlet "About the MIT
Campus Police" on the net.  Here are some relevant portions:

BACKGROUND: In order to be considered for employment as an MIT campus
police officer, the Department normally requires three years of prior
police experience as a campus, municipal or state police officer.
Finalists for all police positions undergo background checks (including
criminal record checks) prior to hiring.

AUTHORITY: All MIT Campus Police officers are qualified under Chapter
22C Section 63 of the Massachusetts General Laws and have full powers as
police with regard to crimes occurring on MIT property. In addition, all
officers hired on or after December 1, 1987 are sworn as Deputy Sheriffs
in Middlesex County.  MIT police officers do not exercise police
authority in the City of Boston and therefore do not patrol MIT
fraternities, sororities or independent living groups located in Boston.
However, the MIT Police do provide emergency medical services.

WEAPONS: MIT police officers and supervisors are armed and must undergo
annual firearms qualifications based on Massachusetts Criminal Justice
Training Council standards. The Department has written deadly force and
non-lethal force policies which are reviewed with officers on an annual
basis.

In addition, they have some control over what gets reported to Cambridge
and state law enforecement authorities.
