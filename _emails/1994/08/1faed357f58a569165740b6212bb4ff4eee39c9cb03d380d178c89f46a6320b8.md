I remember reading an article recently (though I can't remember where)
about making a pure fusion bomb without the need for a fission trigger.
It involved using tritium and a class a VERY high velocity high explosives
known as ballotechnics.  According to this article, these bombs could be
made as small or smaller than a simple fission bomb and would be much harder
to detect, the upshot being that this kind of device was more of a concern
than a fission bomb vis a vis terrorist useage.  

Does anyone have any more technical details on this type of fusion device?
I'll have to see if I can dig out that article sometime.
