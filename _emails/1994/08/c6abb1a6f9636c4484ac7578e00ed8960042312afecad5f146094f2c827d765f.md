Errr: 

Today's Post has a story about Blockbuster Billionare Huizenga. Not
satisfied with buying himself baseball, hockey & football teams, he's
just arranged his own private county. They're calling it Wayne's World.
It will have powers even Reedy Creek Improvement District (aka
Disneyworld) lacks.

The story is lacking in one area -- nary a word about law enforcement
powers. Can you say Robocop or maybe Alien? [both situations where a
corporation becomes the law in & of itself]
