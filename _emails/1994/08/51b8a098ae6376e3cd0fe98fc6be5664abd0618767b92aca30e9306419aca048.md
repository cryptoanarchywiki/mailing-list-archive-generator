NY Times wrote yesterday on "metering" of software usage by 
soft and hard means.  This type of monitoring could easily, 
Clipperly, "1984"-ishly, record and report on other activities 
of the user.  

Recall alarms here recently about covert features of operating 
systems.  Harmless looking hard devices may hide even more 
monitoring features, steganographically (my bag).
