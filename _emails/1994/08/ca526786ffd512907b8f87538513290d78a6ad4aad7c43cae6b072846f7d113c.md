   Those commercial remailers probably will be located around the world,
   so pornography could be send by using an "offshore" [=non-american]
   remailer as last link in the chain. 

One assumption here is that someone in one country can easily pay
someone in another country, and an automatic currency conversion can
take place.  The prerequisites to happen generally for that are the
electronification of retail money in both jurisdictions and a
retail-level currency exchange system.  None of this really exists
yet, although the first beginnings are here.  Also, for anonymous
payment for such overseas services, anonymous transfer in at least one
of the two currencies is necessary.

I point all this out to show that we're a long way from here to there.

   The jurisdiction where this remailer could be located, preferably 
   shouldn't care about pornografy. [Holland, Scandinavia ?]

Yes, that's the right attitude.  The mantra is "regulatory arbitrage",
or, always find a place to do something where it's already legal.

And it's not just the USA.  Expect Britain's libel system to be
stretched by anonymous overseas speech.
