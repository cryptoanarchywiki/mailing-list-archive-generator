I have been worrying a lot about these anonymous return addresses. They seem
very vulnerable to attack.

Say I post a message through remailers to Cypherpunks giving one of these
reply blocks. The TLA need only send a flood of known size messages to this
address, and look to see where the pop out of the net of remailers. Even if
all messages were quantized and only reconstructed by the final recipient, the
TLA could send timed bursts of messages which (even with reordering) would 
allow a statistical determination of the recipient.

I think that the solution to this is some sort of hold and forward on demand
system. An anon ID would be posted to Cypherpunks, and that account ID with
a key, sent to the message holder. One would then request for a certain number
of messages or number of kilobytes of messages to be sent to the address
specified by the old sort of remailer block. This message would be signed by the
key, and could indicate remailing to anywhere, even to another hold and forward
location. This prevents the TLA from sending many messages to the final
destination in such a way that they could be used for traffic analysis.

Thoughts?
