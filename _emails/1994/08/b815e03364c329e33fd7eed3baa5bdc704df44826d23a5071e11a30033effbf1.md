Now that I've got DES running about as fast as it can go on the 486, I
did a little analysis on IDEA. The algorithm is definitely more
straightforward to implement than DES, but not necessarily that much
faster. It uses three primitive operations, all on 16-bit quantities:
XOR, ADD and multiplication modulo 65537.  Each encryption involves 48
XORs, 34 adds and 34 multiplies, plus a few exchanges.

The multiplies are a problem. On the 486, a 16x16 integer multiply
takes from 13-26 clocks, depending on how many significant bits there
are in the multiplicand. Random data usually has 15-16 significant
bits, so this distribution is probably weighted more toward the 26
clock figure. So I count an optimistic total of 990 clocks per 64-bit
encryption, assuming plenty of registers (which I don't have), not
counting the modular reduction steps for each multiply, and ignoring
the memory references for the subkeys.

I figure my DES code is currently taking about 1300 clocks per
encryption. So IDEA won't be much faster, though it may be more
secure.

Anybody know the speed of the integer multiply instruction on the
various PowerPC chips? Along with modular exponentiation and vocoders,
which also do a lot of multiplies, it looks like fast multiplication
is becoming rather important in secure communications.
