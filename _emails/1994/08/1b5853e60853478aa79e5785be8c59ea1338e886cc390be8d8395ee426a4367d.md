* I'm not advocating majordomo code changes here; I just wonder if
* there's an option setting that could be tweaked in the cypherpunks
* list definition. I have been on mailing lists before where the
* traffic always appeared to be 'from' the list, and the only thing
* odd about it was that you had to CC: the author to send a direct
* reply.

should be fairly simple, extropians works that way.
