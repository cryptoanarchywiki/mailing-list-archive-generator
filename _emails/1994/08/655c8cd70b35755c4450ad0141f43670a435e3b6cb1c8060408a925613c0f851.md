What about MDC and Luby-Rackoff (spelling?). I mean sure, they haven't been
subjected to much scrutiny, but they appear to be as strong as their
underlying one-way hashes. I think that their blazing speed merits giving
them serious consideration. Besides, weren't people calling IDEA pretty
secure when it had been subjected to as much analysis as LR and MDC have
been subjected to thus far?
