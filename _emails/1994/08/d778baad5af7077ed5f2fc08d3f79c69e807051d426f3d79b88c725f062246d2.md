The World Affairs Council has cancelled the Aug. 25 crypto policy
debate between PGP author Philip Zimmermann and NSA official Clinton
Brook because of low interest and rescheduled it for Oct. 27 at the
Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. I will post more details as they become
available.

Although I'm disappointed for selfish reasons by the delay, the
rescheduling may work to everyone's advantage. The later date gives the
World Affairs Council more time to line up news media coverage. One
network news magazine has expressed interest in taping the event for
repackaging in some type of feature on encryption and civil liberties.
Also, National Public Radio has expressed an interest as well.

I've rearranged my schedule to attend the event and will prepare a
transcript of the debate to upload to any BBS, forum or news group that
will carry it. Stay tuned.
