With nested encryption through the Labyrinth (first the Net, then the
Web, now the Labyrinth?), only the last remailer who remails to a site
that is under observation or is a sting site (common in Memphis) is
vulnerable.

And even that last remailer may be able to claim ignorance (and win in
court) if he can show that what he mailed was unreadable to him, i.e.,
encrypted to the recipient. (This is another reason I favor a goal of
"everyone a remailer.")

With canonical remailers, and no logging, earlier remailers should be
safe.

By the way, welcome Joichi (your first post to the list, that I can
recall).
