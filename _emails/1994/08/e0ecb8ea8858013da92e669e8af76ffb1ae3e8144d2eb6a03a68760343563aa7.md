The third of my responses to Hal. Also included at the end is a discussion
of a "crypto simulation environment," as it comes up in the context of
Hal's comments about game theory and the need to simulate iterated
prisoner's dilemma types of problems in a crypto context.

I agree that evolutionary game theory has rich implications for real world
cryptography, especially as it involves trading, interactions, cooperation,
etc.

I think they are. Agents in an IPD (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma) game can
change their strategy...that is itself a strategy (e.g., "cooperate for the
first 10 rounds, then nuke opponent"). Is this a change of strategy or a
change in the agent? Maybe this is a semantic misunderstanding, but I don't
see how "Pr0duct Cypher" or "Thoth" is not an Axelrodian agent?

Because Axelrod and his contributors [well-described, by the way, in
Hofstadter's "Metamagical Themas" book] barely scratched the surface of how
real ecologies, real economies work. Reputations do matter, as shown by
another classic game theory result, the "game of chicken." An escrow agent
that defects faces some repercussions (who trusts whom in such disputes is
another issue, possibly handled by selective disclosure, a la Chaum, by
reputation rating services, etc.).

Not in a "positive reputation" system. In a negative reputation system, it
is true that an agent can alway flee and "start over" ("a fresh start').
But in a positive rep. system, each reputation only fairly slowly builds up
a rep. [There are scams, such as the "brilliant penny" scam, to use
collusive reputation setups to "inflate" a rep...nobody claimed it would be
easy.]

It's best that it never be known how many rounds there are to be. Sort of
like not saying whether one is a source or sink of remailed
messages...leave them guessing. (Or more mundanely, keeping the number of
characters in a password a secret...the opponent doesn't have any
"terminal" states or nodes.)

I don't claim to know what the results are, this experiment not having been
done that I know of, but looking around me I see people who interact with
other people and who generally act as though "the game" will go on without
limit. While they certainly don't act purely in a tit-for-tat way, they
also interact as if their reputation for truthfulness, intelligence, etc.
matters to them. (This is true even for most of the pseudonyms we have
here, who give evidence of wanting whatever postivive reputations that have
accrued to them to continue. Financial matters are not necessarily the
same, granted.)

This is a good point, and needs more analysis. It may be that using a set
of escrow agents will lessen the risk that any one of them is about exit,
stage left.

But bear also in mind that many escrow functions can be set up so as to
have almost no benefits to the escrow agent if he defects and attempts to
welch on the deal (kind of a "zero incentive" system). (This is how IOU
systems often work.)

Here I agree most strongly with Hal. I have described my interest in this
area to several Cypherpunks and their friends, including Nick Szabo, Eric
Hughes, and Ted Kaehler (one of the developers of Smalltalk). The "protocol
ecologies" idea I talked about here a month or so ago is related to this.

To wit, building ecologies of interacting "cryptoids" which can scheme,
game, apply various crypto protocols, etc. (I don't mean any high-falutin
artificial intelligence, just a "testbed" for exploring agents that
implement crypto methods as, well, as _methods_.)

Toward this eventual end, if I can pull it off, I'm evaluating
"SmalltalkAgents," a programming environment for the Mac (soon for
Windows/Chicago, then Unix, etc.) which supports several interesting
features, including run-time dynamic typing, multiple threads,
agent-oriented methods (similar to Dylan, and maybe to the elusive
Telescript), and a persistent object store (so that the evolved agents
"remember" what they've learned and don't start from scratch each time).

For you Perl and C fans, why Smalltalk? First, because I get to pick
whatever environment I want. Second, because I enjoyed Lisp programming at
Intel (and a bit since, in Scheme) more than C programming. Third, while I
think the C++ class libraries are a powerful tool, I'm not interested in
using them right now. Fourth, the advent of 50-100 MIPS processors for not
much money places more premium on powerful prgramming environments and not
on runtime efficiency. Fifth, SmalltalkAgents can do external calls of C,
or whatever, code, so the the programming environment of Smalltalk can be
coupled with specific C code fragments. Sixth, the focus on CORBA, OpenDoc,
OLE, and other object protocols.

(I wrote down some of my thoughts on tools for crypto, beyond subroutine
libraries, a few months ago. "Crypto compilers," "intermediate design
languages" (IDLs for crypto anyone?), provably correct synthesis, etc.)

I think Hal is right that ecologies of interacting agents implementing
various crypto protocols (spending digital money, trying to collude with
others, etc.) is a ripe area for study. We learned a lot two years ago with
the "Crypto Anarchy Game" we played with paper and pencil, but we quickly
realized that humans are poor at remembering and enforcing complicated,
multi-stage, multi-party protocols, and that someday these would have to be
programmed into "crypto simulation" tools.

When, if ever, will I have results on this? I don't know. Do I want to
spend the next several years of my life on this? (As surely it's a
thesis-complexity job, or a several man-year job for a small group of
programmers...)

I haven't decided. I haven't decided even if it's the most important--and
interesting, since I'm working for myself, as most of us are--thing to work
on.

Enough writing for now.
