I wonder on which evidence you base your assumptions ?? 
(I would assume schneiers book)

While I agree with the above ciphers, I would also add Loki and Redoc-II
both achieved good results (much better than DES) in regards to differential
cryptanalysis. Also Loki has also performed well against Linear cryptanalysis
- Matsui.
(Biham & Shamir - Differential Cryptanalysis of the Data Encryption Standard)

[ deleted info about trusting amateur ciphers ]

While Schneier's book is a very good guide, it is not very advisable to make
assumptions on the security of algorithms based on his book. One should look
at results from those performing cryptanalysis of such ciphers. Such as
biham and matsui.
