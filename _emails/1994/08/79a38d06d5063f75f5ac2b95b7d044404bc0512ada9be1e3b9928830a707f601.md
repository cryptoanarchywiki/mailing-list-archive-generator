          PGP versions after 2.1 broken?

   In conversation with a student computer site manager, I was told that
all pgp versions after pgp2.1 had been broken. I pressed the kid for
info.. He said that the matter had been settled on "alt.2600" & on
"sci.cryptology". This is probably just loose talk but if anybody would
like they could issue a challenge on these 2 newsgroups.  It might help
to squash rumors. I could get no more info. out of him.
                                          Yours Truly,
                                          Gary Jeffers
