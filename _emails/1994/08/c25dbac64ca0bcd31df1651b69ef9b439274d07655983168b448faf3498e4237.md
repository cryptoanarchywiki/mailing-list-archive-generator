Ok, I'll try sending a post through myself just to see what happens.

Hmmmm...glad someone esle was having this problem. Before they moved
I tried bouncing a chained message through soda (after using the CHAIN
program to prepare it) and soda must have barfed on it as it never made
it out the other end.

Actually, in a couple of recent posts to the more obscure message bases
in USENET I sent the posts first through ghio, then through hacktic,
and from hactic through the gateway at  news.demon.co.uk. The uk gateway
seems to work flawlessly, so I'll figure on sticking with that as my
anon gateway.

You know how it is...once you find a remailer(s)/gateway combo that
works, you tend to stick with it. I find lately i've been going with
wimsey/hacktic/ghio and then out through demon.co.uk.....it seems pretty
stable.

Yeah, I'll give that a shot and see what happens.

By the way, anybody notice if the crypto archives at dsi.unimi.it are up?
I haven't been able to get through all day (Sunday).
