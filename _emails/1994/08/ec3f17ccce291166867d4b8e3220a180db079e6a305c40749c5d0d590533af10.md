Don't most remailers have a 'bit bucket' address tho?  Generating some bogus
bit-bucket messages would solve that problem...

Also, Ghio's remailer lets you put two (or more) messages inside a PGP
envelope, so in theory you could have one message go in and two come out.
There is the size problem tho. :(
