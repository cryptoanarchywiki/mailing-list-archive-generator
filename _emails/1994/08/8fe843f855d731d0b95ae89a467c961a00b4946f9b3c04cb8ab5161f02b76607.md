The goal is to completely defeat traffic analysis, while allowing the
user the freedom to make use of the system through ordinary email.  If
email is used, the risk taken by that user goes up, but without
reducing the security of other users.

In the real world, it would be very difficult to watch all of the links
but fairly easy to subvery some gateways to some extent.

However, as I have argued elsewhere, I think that all of the central
gateways could be compromised and it would make no difference, so long
as the number of users was reasonably large and so long as all of the
users used gateways.  From the opponent's point of view, the problem is
that he cannot tell whether there is any traffic at all.  Everyone
could be whiling away a hot summer afternoon sending noise.

The only attack would be to destroy or modify the incoming traffic.
If there are any gateways functioning correctly, RN software should
detect the damaged packets and route around the gateways that don't
work right.  This is exactly what the Internet does.

A user sending encrypted messages via email reveals his source address.
He should encrypt his message.	The message can be to a 'far' gateway
which then remails it; in this case the 'near' gateway does not know
the destination address.  Messages can be nested to an arbitrary depth.

If a user is using a gateway, the other gateways know that the message
originated at the gateway, but they cannot tell whether that is the
true source of the message.  If the destination is another gateway,
the other gateways do not know whether that is the true destination.

If the message is to be acknowledged back to the source, the source
gateway must be able to receive the acknowledgement.  This creates a
trail of pointers through the network back to the source.

Only the final gateway, which reassembles the message, knows the
ultimate destination.

Each gateway must dispatch a certain number of packets.  There are
a certain number of slots to be filled and a certain number of packets
queued for dispatch.  Packets are assigned an output slot (that is,
they are delayed for a certain amount of "time") according to some
sort of probabilistic distribution function.  Empty slots are filled
with noise packets.  Inter-gateway administrative traffic is queued
just like any other packet.

If a gateway is always connected to the internet, packets can be
dispatched at more or less equal intervals (measured in seconds) or
they can be batched.

Yes, on average, as qualified by 1.8 and 1.9.

Assume that there are only two links, one in and one out.  Packets will
be coming in at a more or less fixed rate.  Some will be consumed
locally, either because they are being used to build messages or because
they are noise.  So per unit time N come in and C are consumed, on average.

The remaining (N-C) packets are available for dispatch.  In the same
time interval, G packets are generated locally.  So a total of N-C+G
packets are to be dispatched.  The system uses a random number generator
to assign a packet a dispatch time slot when it becomes ready.	When
the clock ticks, the next packet in the queue is dispatched.  If there
is no next packet, a noise packet is dispatched.

The system knows how long the output queue is.	If the length of the
queue is increasing, the rate at which packets are dispatched will be
increased.

[I have used the term "latency" here to be provocative.]

If your gateway connects by dial-up, then the length of time that you
are connected to RN is the session time.  There must be some handshaking
at the beginning of the session and at the end.  For machines that are
always on line, a session lasts from one breakdown in inter-machine
connections to the next.

If two machines A and B are connected, then if A sends B 100 packets
per unit time, B must send A 100 packets.

To the gateway which packetized the message, the source gateway.  Assuming
that 'MIRVing' of messages is permitted, the second message in a group
could be an acknowledgement back to the originator.

I think that you must allow for the possibility that the gateways carry
very heavy traffic, say a T1 load (about 1.5Mbit/s).  Then if a user's
machine was talking down a 14.4Kb/s line, allowing the user to connect
would effectively stop the network.  There must be some provision for
inequality in traffic rates along different links.

I assume that in a commercial network, the gateways have accounts with
one another that are settled periodically.  Essentially they charge
each other for non-noise incoming packets at some agreed rate and then
pay the accumulated difference every so often.

Users should pay the gateway which fragments a message.  The charge
should be proportional to the size of the message in packets.  If
messages are nested, you need to include postage.  This requires
anonymous ecash.

I am trying to prevent the inevitable.

Weaken this requirement, eliminating the word 'only'.  Publish the specs
as well, and then say "RN gateway specs should also be available from
trusted sites..."

> >7.1 established gateways would be encouraged to rate new gateways
> What kind of information would be available to them to create the ratings?

Gossip, rumors, route announcements and 'hello, here I am' messages from
the operators of the new gateways, experience in RN data communications
with them, reports from commercial credit agencies, ... whatever
information they could lay their hands on.

The technical information would be published in some standard format,
for example a matrix of claimed lost message rates.
