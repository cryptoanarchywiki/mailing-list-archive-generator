Is this new nomenclature? It sounds less risque than "float", I must say...

Immediate and final clearing must save money, somehow, but right now, it's
hard to prove whether cash is still king in cyberspace. I have a (somewhat
religious, in the sense that it may not be empirically proved in my
lifetime) belief that that's the case.  That's why I like to agitate for a
test. Yes, Tim, I know, you guys aren't bankers...
