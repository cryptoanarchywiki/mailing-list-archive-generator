       DATE   FROM                   SUBJECT                            
    Two related points:
    
    1.  Sorry to waste list bandwidth with such a question, but could 
        someone please post to me the original "Problem in draft FIPS 
        `CRYPTOGRAPHIC SERVICE CALLS'" item? (my server was down at the 
        weekend).
        
    2.  NIST have proposed the draft FIPS to a number of standards 
        development organisations - including X/Open and POSIX - and I 
        know that Microsoft have reviewed it, so it will likely influence 
        interfaces to commercially available cryptographic software and 
        devices.
        If there is anybody with interest in crypto APIs on this list, 
        then your informed comments on this NIST proposal, or other 
        candidates (which I could make available if the level of interest 
        warranted it), or alternatives, would be useful and timely.
    
    Thanks
    
    Piers
