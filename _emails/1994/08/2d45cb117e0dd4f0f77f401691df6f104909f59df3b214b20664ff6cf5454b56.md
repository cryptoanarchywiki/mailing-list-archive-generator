MEETING NOTICE
==============

UniForum Chicago holds its monthly general meeting on Tuesday,
August 16, 1994 at the College of DuPage and everyone is welcome.

This month's speaker is Bruce Schneier, author of APPLIED
CRYPTOGRAPHY, (B. Schneier, Wiley Inc., 1993).  Quoting the back
cover of Bruce's book:

"The explosive growth of public and private computer networks has
resulted in a tremendous increase in the colume of sensitive and
valuable data that is routinely stored and transmitted digitally. 
From computer messages speeding through global networks to vast
sums of money transferred electronically, the greatest challenge in
this new digital world is keeping this formation out of the hands
of unauthorized users who prey on vulnerable computer systems.

"In APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY, data security expert Bruce Schneier
details how programmers can use cryptography--the technique of
enciphering and deciphering messages--to maintain the privacy of
computer data.  Covering the latest developments in practical
cryptographic techniques, the book shows programmers who design
computer applications, networks, and storage systems how security
can be built into the computer software and systems we use every
day.

The meeting will be held at:

College of DuPage
Building M, Room 150
22nd & Lambert
Glen Ellyn, IL  60137
