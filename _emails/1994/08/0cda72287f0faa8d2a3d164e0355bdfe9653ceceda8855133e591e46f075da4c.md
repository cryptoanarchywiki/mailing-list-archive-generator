You sound jaded to me Tim.

As I have alluded in another post, seems the perfect oportunity for doing
some building if one considers it a base system. I have worked on some
POS apps for Sears, Pennies, and McDonalds (if you knew how they make the
fries you would never eat there again!). At the present time they use the
systems for record keeping only. But knowing the big boys as I do (take that
one as you want) I suspect they will want to crawl before they walk.

First get folks used to using it for order only, then later on add some
form of 'shell' where a limited form of credit (purchased off-line) can 
be used (minimizes if not eliminates spoofing of credit). As the  folks
get more used to it then add even more features. Sounds a lot like fishing...:)

Take care.
