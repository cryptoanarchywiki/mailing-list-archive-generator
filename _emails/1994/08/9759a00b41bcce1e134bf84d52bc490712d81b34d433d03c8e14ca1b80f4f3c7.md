Here in the UK we read about lots of terrorist groups, not just the IRA:
ETA in Spain, Kurds (blew up someone in London a few months ago), Iranis
(killed someone in Paris recently), Chchernians (spelling?? -- assasinated
someone in London a couple of months ago), the Mafia, North Koreas
(two separate events in the last few years, a hundred or so people killed
each time), the Animal Liberation Front (blew up a bomb here in Bristol,
injuring a baby), ... there are lots of them.

Maybe you should subscribe to a London newspaper.
