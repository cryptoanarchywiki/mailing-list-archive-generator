Not to mention the fact that without tritium, the "trigger" for nuclear
weapons (and extremely expensive and rare at $ 100m a gram) all you have
is a radioactive paperweight.

This misconception was put to rest by a number of postings such as the 
following:

The "trigger" isn't tritium.  Tritium (along with lithium 6) is used
in fusion bombs.  A fission-only device, ala Hiroshima or Nagasaki,
doesn't require any.

The trigger in the center of the plutonium core is a neutron source,
polonium if memory serves correctly.  Tritium is a beta emitter.

A neutron source is usually a light element with a high neutron/proton
ratio, coupled with an alpha emitter.  I believe the Nagasaki bomb used
beryllium-9.  An alpha particle impacting a beryllium nucleus will fuse
with it, forming carbon-12, and the binding energy will eject a neutron.
I think aluminum and a few other light elements will undergo similar
reactions to release neutrons in the presence of alpha particles.

Polonium is primarilly an alpha emitter.  It would work as part of a
neutron source, but it is not a particularily good choice because its
half-life is only 138.4 days (polonium-210).  This makes it expensive
to obtain, and impractical to store.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Plutonium itself is a decent alpha emitter.  Seems like I've been around
a Pu-Be neutron source somewhere ( but not too close!)

They used to use polonium in static eliminators in darkrooms - don't know 
if they use them anymore, though.

You can still buy those neat little brushes intended to remove dust from
negatives.  Each comes with a polonium source to help kill the static
charge holding the dust.  I've got one right next to my Sunshine Health
Mine radon-emitting pillow.

Quite true.  All you really need for a fission bomb is a casing to hold 
everything together, 2.2 kilos (or so) of U-235 (or a sufficient quantity 
of critical mass other stuff <grin>), and something that will hold it 
together long enough for it to fission.

And no, Taylor, holding them together in your hands won't work 
(unfortunately)... hehehe :)   [...]

Well, you can do it - only you just get a pffutt instead of a bang.
A couple of folks at Los Alamos have tried it.  Regrettably, they're
no longer with us.  I think the practice was called, "pulling the
dragon's tail."
