I don't "need" any these days. My reference to "when we needed" was to
the 1977-1982 period, at Intel. And, yes, we had cut and polishes "hot
rocks," including uraninite, thorianite, and various pure U-238
sheets. 

But the "Kong source" (10 mCi of Po-210) sprayed out vastly more
alphas per square centimeter at the target than the "natural" sources
here. We used sources at a wide range of activities to measure device
sensitivitie3s to alpha particles.
