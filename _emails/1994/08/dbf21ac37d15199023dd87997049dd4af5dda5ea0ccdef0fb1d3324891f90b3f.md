Hello,
The "Hack-Tic Network Foundation" has decided to change its name,
into a more mainstream "XS4all Networking" [access for all]. 

This will include a change in domain name. The changes will be made 
during this weekend, this may cause some slight disturbances in the
remailing service. 

One is advised to do a test messages before an actual remailing request 
since no garantee for proper functioning during this change can be given.

The new domain name will be xs4all.nl, the hacktic.nl domain name will
be operational for another 6 months till february 1995.

The remailers affected are:

    usura@hacktic.nl -> usura@xs4all.nl
    


The adresses for the remailers at my UUCP node:

    nobody@vox.hacktic.nl
    remail@vox.hacktic.nl
  remailer@vox.hacktic.nl
     
      anon@vox.hacktic.nl
      
and the anon-ID's associated with them will be changed at a later date,

more information will be supplied as it becomes available in the following
newsgroups/mailinglists:

    -> alt.privacy.anon-server
    -> alt.anonymous
    -> alt.anonymous.messages
    -> the cypherpunks mailing list
