Why this dichotomy? A cyberspatial entity is somebody who owns a secret
key. If said entity wants to maximize its anonymity it will reveal
nothing about itself. If said entity wants establish the strongest
possible reputation, it will reveal all (and lock itself into doing so
ahead of time). Since it is enourmously difficult to deal with an entity
with no reputation and since it requires a substantial amount of effort
to establish certified facts about the nature of a cyberspatial entity,
one would expect most (if not all) to exist somewhere in between the two
extremes.

Agreed. The forms of information that one might need certified are so
varied that the cyberspatial infrastructure needed to support this
system would be massive. But in the mean time, I would expect insurance
to pick up the slack. Under any such scheme the customer doesn't bother
looking at the entity's credentials... it just looks at the insurance
contract given by the insurance company to the customers of the entity
via a blind signature.

The problem with reputations of this form is that it is difficult to
verify that the customer's opinions were not pre-selected. Otherwise a
business could work under several different pseudonyms, combine only
those pseudonyms receiving rave reviews, and leave you with the
impression that they never had a displeased customer. Of course this
happens to a degree in the real world today.

That sounds an awful lot like a person to me.

I strongly refute the notion that anything other than federal regulations
prevent this situation from existing in the real world today... And federal
regulations can be replaced by cybergovernments.

This is easy, prevent the agent from taking the money without the
agreement of a set of other parties. Hold money in escrow from the
escrow.

A key IS an identity. In terms of dealings with corporations there is
no situation in which the official name of the corporation is any more
useful than the key. When dealing with humans, yes a system which
prevents an individual from every changing names can be very valuable,
but such a system is difficult to maintain and requires of high level
of physical realm support.
