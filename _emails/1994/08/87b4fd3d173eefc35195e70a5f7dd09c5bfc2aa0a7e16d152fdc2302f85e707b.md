     That's very true. The fact that they have been simmering is one
thing. Clinton's administration wants to raise the heat and boil the
issue. Just like every tax payer bears the burden of debt for every
taxpayer before him, so too does every politician bear the burden of the
old ideas he proposes as new ones.

     And it's funny: When phrased that way, most people see little
SECURITY, and ignore the first half. When phrased as "A little security
only costs a little freedom", all of a sudden, people are up in arms.
*sigh*
