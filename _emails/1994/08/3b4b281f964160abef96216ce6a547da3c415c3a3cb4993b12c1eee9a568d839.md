I can't recall any time I've laid out a complicated structure to avoid the
privacy invaders.  Most of my techniques are simple and depend merely on a
willingness to not do the conventional things that other people tell you are
necessary if you are to prosper.  

In fact, hasn't Tim May actually accused me of offering solutions that are
too simple and that are not based on careful and exotic Harry Margolis sort
of International Tax Planning?

The many people who have gotten anonymous Visa and Mastercard credit cards
for example have used the simple scheme of applying for a secured credit
card in a nome de guerre.  Others have opened bank accounts in convenient
names that come with Visa debit cards.  It is actually easier than it has
ever been to obtain credit cards in names other than your own.  Signet Bank
is promoting it's secured credit card with TV ads.

Gee, I wish you could convince my wife that I "go to great lengths."  She
always accuses me of taking the easy way out.  <G>
