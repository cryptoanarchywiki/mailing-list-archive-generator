Interesting point... I guess that is a good reason why free anonymous
remailers might not ever die out, but pay remailers may be able to
offer enhanced features and services that would tend to attract the
vast majority of customers (assuming such a service would be
considered as valuable by enough people ;)

I mean, it is easy enough to run a remailer from a school account or
something like that, except you have little control: it may be
forbidden (here at Rice for example), you may be told to shut it down
(Netcom, U of Buffalo, U of Washington), you may have a disk quota
(previous remailer I ran which stored messages, mixed and sent them at
midnight) which would limit certain features, you may not be able to
use "cron" or "at", you may not be able to turn off sendmail logging,
you may not have the account for very long... you may want to offer
usenet posting but can't, you may be subject to various denial of
service attacks, you may want to name your remailer "nobody" but
can't, you may want to alter sendmail config files, etc.

And then maybe you'd like to experiment with something really
different, like running an fsp daemon and letting people fsp files to
you to be remailed.  Or something of this nature, which may require
leaving a program running all the time, listening to a port for
connections.  But maybe you can't do this either.

On the other hand, if you owned your own machine and net connection,
you are in a position to address all these concerns, and the people
who are concerned enough to seriously use anonymous remailers may be
willing to pay a postage fee.
