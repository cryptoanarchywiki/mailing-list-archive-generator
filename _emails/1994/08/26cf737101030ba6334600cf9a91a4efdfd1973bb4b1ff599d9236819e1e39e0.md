In my last post, I forgot to mention that Cray Computer Company
actually *did* and *does* fabricate its own chips! They committed to
GaAs from a supplier and then bought the supplier when it faltered.

My recollection is that it was Gigabit Logic, but it _might_ have been
the "other" GaAs supplier, whose name escapes me this minute.

I'm not claiming this as the proximate cause of Crayco's current
problems. But I do think committing to GaAs *was* a factor, and this
relates to the levels of integration in CMOS and BiCMOS versus the
levels currently obtainable in GaAs.

A huge fraction of Crayco's spending went into the advanced robotic
wirebonding and packaging of thousands of GaAs chips. IBM spent vast
fortunes on its advanced packaging/cooling systems, while Intel and
other chip companies concentrated on CMOS VLSI, with much lower
overall packaging and cooling costs for the same performance.
