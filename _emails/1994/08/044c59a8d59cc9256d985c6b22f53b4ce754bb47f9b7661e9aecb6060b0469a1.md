Actually, data compression doesn't fall under this restriction, because the
primary intent is not to obscure the meaning - it is to facilitate more
efficient of the spectrum.

If you want to apply for an STA (which I hear the FCC is pretty liberal about)
you can do pretty much what you want to do.  If memory serves, this is how
ASCII packet was developed and also spread spectrum.
