But even wide spread use of these technologies, are nothing more
than the excorcise of free speech and the right to be free from
self incrimination and warrentless search and seizure.

Again, you're well within your rights in not aiding their investigations.

The US constitution has already been stretched to include foreign
nationals under its jurisdiction.  In fact foreign nationals can
claim many if not all the rights accorded a citizen of the united
States (though they must know exactly how to assert those rights
or they will be forfeited).

In short, borders don't make any difference to the USG.

You would arguably be purging yourself if you did this trick under
a court order.  But this is a valid point.

This is the recourse of the state.  And it is not merely one or
two years.  Prison terms for contempt of court are indefinite.
Unless you can prove that you _cannot_ be coerced, they can continue
to coerce you.  In all fairness, contempt of court carries a more
serious punishment than any crime except the death penalty (which
IMHO is superfluous and unnecessary cruft anyway, your mileage may
vary).

"Fishing expeditions" border on being unconstitutional.  As for
expensive law enforcement, nowhere in the united States Constitution
is there any mention of a state's right to cheap and easy law
enforcement.  As

When you combine crypto with the fact that on a network, people
inside and outside the "jurisdiction" are equal, enforcement
capabilities are reduced.

So yes, crypto does have the potential to make the cops present
job much more difficult.  But that is mostly because law enforcement
has, over the years, eroded nearly all our civil liberties.

In short the state today is stretching and even breaking the limits
of constitutionality.  Crypto has the potential to allow us to
swiftly and ruthlessly reclaim our civil liberties.  And yes, the
cops are going to have to get creative to keep up.
