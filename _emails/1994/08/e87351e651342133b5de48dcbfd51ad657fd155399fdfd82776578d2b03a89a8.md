We just had thread about that. I had brought up Gerry O'Neill's old book
"2081", which had a discussion of buying things by picking them up and
walking away with them (everything, including you, had an identifying
transponder).  There was some talk about Xerox PARC's work with
transponders in their "Ubiquitous Computing" office concept.

What I didn't understand was how to implement Esther Dyson's idea about
people owning all their personal information and protecting all that
"property" with strong crypto. Paradoxically, I bet both these ideas
(transponders and personal information as property through strong crypto)
can work together.


Cheers,
