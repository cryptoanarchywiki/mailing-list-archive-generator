According to recent press reports in the UK, when Soviet bombers were
loaded with nuclear weapons, they were actually dummies (because the
generals, etc, didn't trust the crews).  This suggests that the Soviets
did not have reliable safeguards on the bombs.

Various arguments between the Ukraine and the USSR about ICBM warheads,
also reported in the press, suggest that the safeguards on the warheads
were reliable, because both parties seemed to agree that the Ukrainians
couldn't set them off, although they are otherwise technically competent
in dealing with the missiles.
