It looks to me like you've "supposed" away the real obstacle to 
anonymous messages - the practice of logging traffic. Once you assume
that people won't keep logs, the rest of the protocol is unnecessary -
everyone's got anonymous messaging capability already. Forgery prevention
is more useful when it's user-to-user, not host-to-host; we can do this
already with PGP. 

The tricky part is finding a way to preserve anonymity where the
majority of sites on the Internet continue to log traffic carefully,
refuse to install new software (especially anon-positive software),
and are administrated by people with simplistic and outdated ideas
about identity and punishment.
