Heinlein suggested something similar (along with a few other "alternative"
forms of government) in the afterword to "Who Are The Heirs of Patrick
Henry" in _Expanded Universe_. Heinlein suggests:
 
    "A State where anyone can buy for cash (or lay-away installment plan)
    one or more franchises, and this is the government's sole source of
    income other than services sold competitively  and non-monopolistically.
    This would produce a new type of government with several rabbits tucked
    away in the hat.  Rich people would take over the government?  Would
    the, now?  Is a wealthy man going to impoverish himself for the privilege
    of casting a couple of hundred votes?  Buying an election today, under
    the warm body (and tombstone) system is much cheaper than buying a
    controlling number of franchises would be.  The arithmetic on this
    one becomes unsolvable...but I suspect that paying a stiff price (call
    it 20,000 swiss francs) for a franchise would be even less popular
    than serving for two years."
 
Personally, I favor his government that requires an intelligence/knowledge
test before a person can vote.  I especially like his "Improving the Breed"
variation on this one. :-)
 
BTW, he also suggests the government in Twain's _The Curious Republic
of Gondor_, but I've never read this book.  Can anyone describe the
goverment posited in this book?
