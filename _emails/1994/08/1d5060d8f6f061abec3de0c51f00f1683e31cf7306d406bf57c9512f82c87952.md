	I think its Duncan who's been talking about secured credit
cards.  As long as the intent is not to defraud, you can call yourself
whatever you want and its legal.  So create a temporary psuedonym.

| Can someone suggest a way to accomplish all this?

	With tools that exist no less.  Each participant gets a penet
account, and agrees to maintain it for (some time period).  Part of
their payment is withheld as assurance that the account will be
maintained.

	Each participant chooses a passphrase, and feeds that to
S/key, providing the 100th md4 hash of their secret passphrase.  They
enclose this number in their encrypted response form.  They also
enclose their participant ID #, and an address.

	When HHS asks for verification that the participants were
real, they select a random set of penet IDs, and mails each of them,
asking that they show up, bringing a lawyer to protect them from HHS
intimidation and the 99th md4 hash of their secret passphrase.  They
have thus demonstrated who they are, and can answer questions as they
feel relate to them not being in colusion with the researchers.

	I think that deciding whether or not this is useful would
require reading the regulations imposed on the researchers by the
agency administering the grant.
