Humm. Do Microsoft shareholders know that the company is being run
in order to empower folks, as oppposed to making money? I must confess
that I was (until now) unaware of that.

Shareholders only know that software with uncalculable benefits is 
being produced & being widely accepted for no discernible reason, with 
profit being an unintended side effect which they can take advantage of.
