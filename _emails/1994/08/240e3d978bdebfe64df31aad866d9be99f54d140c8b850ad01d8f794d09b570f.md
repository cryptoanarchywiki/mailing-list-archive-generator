From Pat Farrell, quoting Peter Denning:

"..... Now the strength of the country depends not only on its 
government  but on its corporations.  . . . . 

A new policy aligned with the new clearing would be for the  
National Security Agency to make its expertise available to the 
 private sector, enabling markets to flourish in a worldwide  
information medium."
.................................................................
.....

What an amazing difference between Dennings.
What a great idea for the NSA were to become allies and start 
working for us, instead of for 'them'.
The perception of it (NSA) would change in everyone's eyes; 
even pencil-toting nerds could learn to like them.
