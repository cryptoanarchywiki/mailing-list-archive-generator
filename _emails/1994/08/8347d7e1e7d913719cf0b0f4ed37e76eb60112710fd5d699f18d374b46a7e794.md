What about later Byzantium? The last 100 years of the Ottomans? Most of the
history of the Holy Roman Empire? Capetian France? Egypt under the Mamluks?

There are many examples of a government peacefully becoming incompetent and
weak. Sometimes, an outside power moves in. Sometimes, anarchy results, and
later a strong new government arises. Sometimes, things just muddle along
for a while, with most people ignoring government entirely.

That all of these periods end with the rise of, or takeover by, another
government, proves nothing. Every historical period has an end. Does anybody
here think that the current set of governments in the world is static for
all time? Those who think that governments only get stronger is taking too
short a view. The Babylonian, Roman, and Persian empires were all succeeded
by far weaker, less centralized, power structures.

The questions are: what comes next? And what can we do to make what comes
next bearable?

But you can make a good case that this was BECAUSE the monarchy had not been
drastically weakened and impaired for a time before the revolution. The
revolution was too sharp a jolt, and the system became unstable. Politics
abhors a square wave.

It also had the more-than-tacit support of the government.

Instrument of oligarchy might be closer. Many poor whites were 'kept in
line' by it, as well as the blacks.

How can you distinguish the marauders and the government? There was an
anarchic transition period. Some areas/groups did well (such as the Coassaks,
and parts of the Caucasus) some did very badly. Does this signify anything?

  > Stalin was an expression of the people's will.

I think that you are confusing 'the people' and 'the government.' Trotsky
was much more the choice of 'the people.' That's why he was charged with
'bonapartism.'

You seem to be hooked on organized conflict. I think you vastly underestimate
the power of incompetence, corruption, and bureaucracy.

Tell that to the Afghans. The Afghan tribes have a long history of defeating
governments with only a lose tribal and clan system.

Or to help it degenerate into incapacity.
