It's important not to pile on too many features, desires, agendas onto a
relatively simple financial instrument.  The point of digital cash is to
provide liquidity for internet commerce as cheaply as possible. Anonymity
is a happy benefit. Engineering it for anyother purpose reduces its
efficiency.

Or, you can take money in over the window and turn it into digital cash
denominated on a dollar basis, priced at that point with discounts or
primia as necessary. Occam's razor.

That's true, but the difference in price reflects the estimated future
value of that money in a suspension account plus the operating costs of the
underwriter, not by some complex pricing methodology which makes the cash
more difficult to use.

I cash out my "digiDollar" today, it's a dollar.  I cash out my digiDollar
tomorrow, it's a dollar. I cash out my digiDollar the next day, it's a
dollar.  Looks pretty simple to use to me. (a digiDollar is a dollar is a
dollar is a dollar) :-).
