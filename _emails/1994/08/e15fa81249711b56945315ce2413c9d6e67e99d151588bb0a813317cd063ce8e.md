If you see a guy skulking in a dark alley with a gun, a knife, and a
large club, do you debate whether he is of necessity about to use them?
...........................................................................

No, but maybe he wouldn't be planning to use them on *me*.

Maybe he was chasing a burglar or pedophile; maybe he was in danger of 
being abducted by little green men from Mars;  how would *I* know what 
he was doing out there in full armor?

I could watch and wait, with my cam-corder ready in case anything 
really interesting really happened.
