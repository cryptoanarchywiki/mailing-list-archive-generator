The IRS/Treasury/etc. has the term "structuring" to refer to attempts
to circumvent the reporting laws by doing "individually legal"
transactions which are "collectively illegal." For example, getting
around the $10,000 limit (which may have been lowered, I hear) by
doing multiple $9,000 transactions. FinCEN (Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network) is a multi-agency body that looks for things like
this.

Consistent with earlier points about the government not wanting to
make it completely clear what's legal and what's illegal (regulatory
discretion), the laws about structuring are not clear. Suspicion of
structuring seems to be enough for a costly investigation and possible
prosecution.

It'll be interesting to see how crypto transactions are treated. The
possibilities for structuring are exciting to we Cypherpunks, which
means the Feds may act quickly to declare such transactions illegal.

(Connections to key escrow/GAK, illegality of digital cash, legal
hacking, and the huge new NRO complex near the credit card companies
is left as an exercise.)
