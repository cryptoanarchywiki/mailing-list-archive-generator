  I have also heard this. At school they ask you for your SSN  when 
signing up for classes, but you can get a random id number assigned 
instead(I found this out long after giving them my SSN).

  I filled out a credit app at Sears last month that asked for my SSN, I 
didn't give it and didn't get credit either. What exactly is SS related 
use? Banks, Employment only?
