Can you please stop mailing me these unidentifyable, undecodable
files from a person I cannot identify, nor detect the reason for
the anonymity?

Maybe if there was an explanation as to why I should bother to play
with all this, I would understand. As my telepathy seems to not be
working right now, you'll have to write it in plain english (lame
monolanguage american).

Thanks.


PS: 

You misspelled 'cypherpunks' in the Reply-to field, which is where this 
seems to be going, and I'm sure my reply to the list will annoy everyone. 
Take it out on the anonymous bulk-mailer person.
