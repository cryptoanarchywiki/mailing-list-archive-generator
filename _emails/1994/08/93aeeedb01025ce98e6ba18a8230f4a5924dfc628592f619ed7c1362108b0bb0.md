First, just let me note that there are a thousand ways to structure it.
In my example, Microsquish gets to hold a challenge whenever they want
to. If everybody is being honest Microsquish will lose eight nano-slinkys
each time they challenge so they won't do it frequently. If everybody
is not being honest, Microsquish will collect substantial damages.

I refuse to get into another vocabulary fight :)

Lets just say that Charles isn't geting as much as he would like. Pay per
use is good for the consumer... note the resentment that high software
prices have created. Although everybody wins by adopting a system that
better approximates reality, ala superdistribution (but we are dealing with
authentication here, not information and after thinking about it alot I have
decided that authentication is NOT necessarily a form of information in that
you can easily demonstrate to somebody that you have been authenticated
without giving them the ability to prove it to somebody else [again lets not
get into a terminology debate, my point is that the intangible asset here
has a different set of properties from the kind we usually deal with in
information economy scenarios]), the consumer with his smaller buying power
wins the most.

So it would really suck for Charles to lose big at the hands of the consumer
because he tried to do something that dramatically improved the consumer's
position.

Now that I think about it, its possible that I'm in error approaching this
problem from a cryptographic standpoint. Maybe the correct course of action
is to establish a cybergovernment which prohibits "Ingve the insurance
salesman" attacks and then set up the fine structure such that the
conspirators will have an enormous incentive to turn each other in.

Agreed, but it is highly desirable for charles NOT to be forced into
selling certifications for a one time fee from the standpoint of all
involved. Assuming Charles is intelligent, unless we can demonstrate
to him a system that prevents these kinds of attacks, he's going to
be stuck with the one time fee payment scheme.

Yeah. I hadn't been looking at it that way because in my model Ingve gets
played by an agent. There IS, however, an argument for giving control of
Ingve to a third party. As I note above, every time Microsquish checks on
the consumer it loses money. An Ingve could act as an intermediary between
Microsquish and a far larger number of consumers. The relationship thus
built (combined with statistical reality) allow Microsquish to use far
fewer test cases and place a significant (but of course not total) amount
of trust in Ingve's methods for guaranteeing valid licenses [whatever
they may be. It is quite conceivable that there are other things which
can alter the probabilities besides actually challenging the consumer
to get a certification from Charles]. This saves Microsquish, and infact
the whole system, money.

Cheers,

Jason W. Solinsky

BTW, perhaps there is an easier solution: only permit Cherles's
certifications to exist in an environment that he controls. Smart
cards and remote computers can easily do this, although remote
computers are undesirable due to their communications overhead.
