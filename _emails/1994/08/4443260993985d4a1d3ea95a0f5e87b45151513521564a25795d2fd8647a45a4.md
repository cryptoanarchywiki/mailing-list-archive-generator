I made no claim.  I asked a question.  I quote the exchange in its
entirety:

This is fundamentalist ranting, followed by a reasonable question,
followed by <infidel! he dares to question the holy word!>, followed
by ritual denunciations from bystanders.

I am an agnostic.  I don't believe that 'they' exist.  I believe that
you have a system staffed by a random selection of the American
population, somewhat skewed because people have some control over
what area they work in.  To work with a system, you need to understand
it objectively, you need something more than incantations.
