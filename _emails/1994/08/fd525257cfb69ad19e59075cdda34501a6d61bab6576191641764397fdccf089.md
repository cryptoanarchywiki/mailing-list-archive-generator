I thought extra useless junk traffic was one main objective of a
remailing network?   The more the better..  As far as the idea
that an eavesdropper could tell which remailers you are going to
use - they already know.  They can ping the same sites you do
and as long as you ping *every* site you know of, instead of
just the ones you'd like to use on any given message, this
doesn't give the spooks one iota of new information.

>All participating remailers would post an "i'm here" message on it

As long as the key isn't trusted just because it was in the
newsgroup - this sounds workable.  Or, each remailer could have
a mailing list of addresses it sends the "i'm here" message to. 
Again, this gets the spooks no new information - if you use a
remailer even once, you have to assume that if some one was
watching closely enough, they *know* you used the system, and
they *know* your chosen destination received a message from the
system.  They just can't figure out who sent what to who.

This seems backwards to me - I think what you want is local
software that is smart enough to figure out the state of the
remailer-net.  You needn't rip apart nor rebuild the whole net,
just write some code :)
