There are some people from GMU ("Coalition for Electronic Markets;
George Mason Program on Social and Organizational Learning") talking about
superdistribution schemes (one put an article in the new Wired) and
internet commerce on the new (?) www-buyinfo list I just started watching.

The buyinfo folks seem to be reserecting the discussions which used to take
place on the imp-interest list, which has pretty much croaked.  They are
talking on buyinfo about secure mosaic, digital signatures, digital cash,
etc.

I think the list is driven by majordomo and its address is:

www-buyinfo@allegra.att.com

If anyone has comments on this bunch, it may be interesting to hear them here.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
