Remember that the original assumption was that you were choosing five
remailers at random, on each transmission. I argue against this
strategy; I think that if you know someone is reliable you should
stick with them.

80% of the remailers are compromised, so 2/3 of single messages get
through OK, 45% of two message sequences, 30% of three message
sequences, etc.

If a population of users selects five remailers at random and sticks
to their initial selection, 1/3 of the population will be compromised
immediately.  Langley will have to try harder to get the rest.
