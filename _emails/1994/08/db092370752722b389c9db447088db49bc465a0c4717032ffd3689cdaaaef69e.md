	A system built like this is not only expensive in terms of
paying employees, its also asking to be exploited.  The people doing
the ID checking are likely to be poorly paid, poorly trained,
undermotivated and easily bribed into entering the data of your
choice, giving away their password, etc.

	Also, the folks who do the archiving (the physical tape
swapping, labelling, etc) are likely to be as easily manipulated as
the ones who do the identity verification.
