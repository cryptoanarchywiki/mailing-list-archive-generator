My "if you are using unmodified ..." clause shows that I understand this.

You can send from a very large network and forge your TCP/IP or
(more difficult) Ethernet source address.  But I can sit on the same
network, build a table relating TCP/IP to ethernet (or whatever)
addresses, and filter out messages that should not be there.  There
are commerical packages that do this sort of thing.

Basically, this is a different topic.  One problem is designing a
generic software package and set of protocols that will allow you
to route mail anonymously.  This is a general problem.	The hacking
of specific networks is a different, if related, problem.
