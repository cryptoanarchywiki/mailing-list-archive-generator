OK. Your question has two parts.  First, Eric, what exactly do you mean by
'nonbank notes'. Like the kind issued by corporations in the money markets,
or Amex Traveller's Checks?.

Second, we need a lawyer.  This is a good thing, 'cause a you can't hack
laws without a lawyer (most of the time, anyway...), and
(ObThreadRelevance) we need one to pitch this stuff to other lawyers
(regulators, et. al.) anyway...
