C'punks,

No, I didn't forget about Acapulco H.E.A.T.  This week's episode
was, "Code Name: Stranded."  In this installment some of the Team
boat off to an "uninhabited" Mexican island for a picnic and R&R.
Of course, they forget to anchor the boat so they get stranded.
To make matters worse, their is a loony Viet Nam vet (is there
any other kind?) on the island who still things he's in 'Nam.

Well, it goes pretty much as you would expect:  gunfire, snake
attack, poisonous spider attack, exploding hut and bikinis.
There is *only* one crypto tie-in (and it's a stretch).  They
communicated an SOS to the remaining Team members by juryrigging
an old field radio without a microphone, so that they could send
Morse code.  No Fabio, plenty of exposed Alison Armitage.

FOR THE RECORD

The cast listed above the main title:

Catherine Oxenberg (Ringo Starr's wife
Brandan Kelly
Alison Armitage (yeah!)
Spencer Rochfort
Holly Floria
Michael Worth

The cast listed below the main title:

Randy Vasquez                  Graham Heywood
John Vernon                    Fabio (boo!)

The executive producers are Max Keller, Jacques Konchier and
Micheline Keller.

The H.E.A.T. Team hotel location is provided by the Westin Regina
Resort in Puerto Vallarta.

The program is co-produced by M-6 and Les Films du Triangle with
the participation of the Centre National de la Cinematographie.

International Financing is by European Communications Inc.

C'punks, I'm sure these last two items are where the motion
picture business privacy, "regulatory arbitrage" and tax
avoidance angles come in.
