Axelrod's second tournament had a variable number of interactions,
precisely to defeat penultimate-interaction attacks.  He added this
specifically because his first tournament had a fixed and known number
of interactions, and several programs took advantage of it.  However,
even in the first tournament, the "nice" programs did better than the
"mean" programs, and Tit-for-Tat was the winner.

I suppose this doesn't prove much, insofar as a Tit-for-Tat-but-
Screw-Em-on-the-Last-Round program would probably have come in first
had it been entered.  Even so, I expect that the marginal increase in
score over Tit-for-Tat would have been vanishingly small for a large
number of interactions.
