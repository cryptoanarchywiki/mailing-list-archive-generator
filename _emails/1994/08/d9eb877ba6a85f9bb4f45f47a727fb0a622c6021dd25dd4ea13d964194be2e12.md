MIT Campus Police are full police officers as far as the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts is concerned.  They have all gone through the state
police academy, and they are all cops.  They have complete
jurisdiction over the MIT property.  And yes, they _do_ carry guns
at all times (at least while in uniform).

I've seen some of the MIT CP HQ, although I've not received a full
tour of the facilities (maybe I will some day).

Also, it is considered bad form for an MIT CP to arrest an MIT
student.  However I have seen them arrest people (although I've
never seen a firefight ;-)
