   NewJargonNotice("suspension account")

   Is this new nomenclature? It sounds less risque than "float", I must say...

As Hal pointed out, this term refers to the double-entry book notation
used to keep track of how much digital cash has been withdrawn but not
yet deposited.  I don't think I invented this use of the word
"suspension", but I also can't find where I might have picked it up.

One can consider that a digital cash exchange creates a delay between
the two legs of the transaction.  In between the beginning and end,
the transaction is suspended.  That's the sense of the word.

"Float" is a financial concept, not an accounting one or a legal one.
The issues are greater than financial ones only, and the terminology
needed is correspondingly greater.

Eric
