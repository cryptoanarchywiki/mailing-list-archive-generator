No.  The object of government is to limit the freedom of the people it
governs.  The word is derived from "govern" which means "3. To control the
actions or behavior of  4. To keep under control; *restrain*" [American
Heritage Dict.]

It would be great if government could be a service provider, or simply feel
responsible for those it governs--but then it would not be a government any
longer.

It would also be nice if I won the lotto. ;)
