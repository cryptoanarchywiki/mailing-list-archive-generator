Absolutely nothing.

I wasn't aware that child welfare workers and former Branch Davidians
were members of the ATF.

One mother reported that Koresh ordered her to spank her one year
old baby with a wooden paddle and wouldn't let her stop until the
child was bleeding.  This was because the child had cried while 
Koresh was giving a sermon.  I see no "restraint" or "compassion" here.

The ATF was completely unjustified in their assault.  That, of course,
does not refute any of the charges that the Branch Davidians were not
particularly nice to the younger members of their congregation.
