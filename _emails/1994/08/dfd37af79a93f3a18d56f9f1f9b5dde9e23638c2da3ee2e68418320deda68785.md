Where you stand on this one depends on where you sit. ;-). It seems to me
that one could just as easily treat digicash as securities denominated in
dollars, just like shares in a money market mutual fund, or more to the
point, the actual money market instruments, repos, for instance. It's going
to take a sophistical titan to get this through the courts, but if there's
a market for digicash, hey, it can happen.  It won't happen if this titan's
employers never hear about it, though.

Indeed. This is probably where we have a problem.  The only thing I can
think of here is that the technology of the internet and it's limitless
opportunity for regulatory arbitrage.  When you make the possession of a
medium of exchange illegal you get the same problems that all closed
economies have.  With the internet, enforcement is half next to useless (an
expression I picked up in Albuquerque a while back...).  Like I said to
Eric in the last post, it may be the threat of regulatory arbitrage that
wins the day here, like it has in the past.

To plug the thread a bit here, who should chair the afternoon
business-heavy session? *Email* me your suggestions, please...

Cheers,
