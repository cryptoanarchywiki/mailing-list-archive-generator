But what is the age of consent for such in the Netherlands?  I believe I saw
on an educational TV program here in the U.S. that the age of consent in the
Netherlands was 14.  If so, what affect does that have on what is considered
"child pornography"? [before the flames start, I would like to point out
that my question is 'scholarly' :-]
