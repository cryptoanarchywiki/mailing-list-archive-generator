We were talking about physical ABUSE, not physical PUNISHMENT.  There is
a difference, unless of course you're one of those people that believe
that they're one in the same and that parents shouldn't be allowed to
physically discipline their children in any manner whatsoever.

When I was a child, we had a room devoted to the physical discipline of
us children: my parents bedroom.  And in that room, specifially the closet,
my father kept the appropriate paraphenalia: belts.  Do you believe my
parents should have been arrested for "child abuse"?  I don't.

The fact stands that there was no evidence that the children in the 
compound were ABUSED.  The Texas department of child welfare cleared 
Koresh of all such charges.  If you have any documentation to the
contrary, I would certainly be interested in seeing it.  I don't want
to see evidence of PUNISHMENT, only ABUSE.
