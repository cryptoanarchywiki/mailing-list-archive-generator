I was originally going to e-mail this to the people who made the

the distinction of who said what, but after re-reading I think it's 
directly related to Big Brother's attempts at limiting our privacy

We built Hussein, and I believe that Kadaffi was still struggeling 
to build chemial when we bombed him in '86, or so, but I believe I could 
be mistaken.

   Every orginization which exists in the middle east has a purpose,
 Hezbullah's purpose is the liberation of Palestine, using nukes would be 
 counter produtive, like in the movie "red dawn" USSR invaded, but USA
 wouldn't use nukes on it's own territory, because that would make it 
 worthless land.

think critically, 
1) What would be gained by nuking the US?
    there are more Muslims here then there are Jews
2) the objective of "terror tactics" is to destroy a lot of property with 
   as few injuries as possible, something akin to "counting coup"
   to demonstrate that "IF their intention had been to kill people, alot 
   more bodies would be found, which (ie more fatalities) is easly 
   accomplised by simply packing the bomb with shrapnal. 

 could you be more specific about which "fundamentalists" you're talking 
 about?

   OY! please don't make generalizations. Iran had a popular revolution and 
 overthrew the Shah (it's well documeted that he tortured prisoners in his 
 jails) and replaced it with a democratic parlement, and implemented 
 Islamic law, the USA urged Saddam Hussein to attack them and refused to 
 extridite the Shah to be tried for his crimes.
   Would you expect any less after that? Who else called the USA a satan? 
 the "ENEMY" is dictators who suppress the people from democratic elections
 and the countries who back them. therefore keep your eye on Egypt, but
 they're not very conserned about the USA because there's not much the 
 USA can do to interfere there.

 that's common knowlage, when Iraq got close to developing them, Israel 
 bombed them.
 
 the only country the usa is throwing a hissyfit about is Pakistan.
 (and N. Korea)

the 5 largest nuclear powers are 1) USA 2) Russia 3) china 4) India
5) Israel (believed to have about 100 warheads)

   Uzbek was part of the USSR, and that's where they deposited some of their
 permanent sites, Uzbek refused to return them when the federation broke 
 apart because they (they're smart) don't trust the russians farther then 
 they can throw a nuke at them, after all they wanted nothing to do 
 with USSR and were forced into the USSR by the soviets invading.
    Nukes are their insurance, they're not going to be parting with those 
 any time soon. China is who they should be keeping an eye on.
   Smaller weapons certainly, such as stinger missiles, but that's
 capitalism :)
 
   A large part of the former USSR was Muslim and there were strategic and
 tactical nuclear weapons scattered all over the place (tactical weapons
 are used as mines, fired from artillery pieces, carried by short range
 missiles, and dropped from fighter bombers).  If none of these is
 unaccounted for, it is a genuine miracle.
 
 It was my understanding that only the USA was incompetent enough to develop
 "tactical" nuclear weapons where any grunt can drop them and KABLEWY

 The "defector" is an idiot, saudies were too busy building infrastructure
 to waist money backing other people's weapons development.
   The Saudies backed Iraq because they were fighting Iran and saudies 
 aren't too fond of Shi'a. It might also be noted that the USA is similarly
 guilty.

 <BUZ> that's deaths from lightning on golf courses verses "terrorist attacks"
 I should have made that more clear, sorry.  
  I'm glad that you mentioned that though, lets remember that it was the
 USA who was the "terroist" who bombed the civilians at Nagasaki and 
Heroshima (terrorist as defined in the dictionary)

At least not called terrorist in USA papers, in fact only the British 
news agencies call the IRA terrorists, american papers seem to take a 
neutral attitude to the situation.

  my paragraph was in responce so automaticaly equating "nessisary 
step-ups in security against terrorists" as a codeword for "spying on 
arabs and muslims" by the FBI and CIA.
