Right, and I was saying maybe not even majority rule or will of the herd,
but a system with a dynamic of its own.  People get the government they

when even the brightest anarchists haven't found a working solution.

It is said a Shao Lin priest can walk through walls.
Looked for, he cannot be seen.
Listened for, he cannot be heard.
Touched, he cannot be felt.
