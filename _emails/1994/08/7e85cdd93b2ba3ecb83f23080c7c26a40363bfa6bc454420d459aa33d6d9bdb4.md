That depends on definitions. For instance, if I say "without stealing
a copy of our one-time pad, or using coercion on one or the other of
us, it would be impossible to forge a message between myself and my
correspondant who shares a one-time pad with me, given that we
properly use the one-time pad only once", I'm being reasonably correct --
no amount of expenditure of resources will do better for you than a
random guess.

It isn't true that "anything can be done given enough effort". Some
things cannot be done period, and some things cannot be done given
that we live in a finite universe.

Myself, I worry about the physical security of my keys a lot more than
about someone factoring them in most instances.
