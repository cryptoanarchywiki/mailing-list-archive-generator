Huh?  This is gobbledygook.  Get specific.  What is it that party A is
providing that would motivate party B to "agree to more constraining
laws?"   Or do I have it backwards; I can't even tell which of these
parties is supposed to be a "government".

This is just gobbledygook again.  Please describe how a "voluntary"
government would prevent "aliens" from conducting their own economic
transactions completely outside this system.  And what is meant by the
phrase "refusing contact?"  Does this mean that the government to which
I don't "belong" will refuse to receive communications from me?  How is
this a penalty?

Perhaps.  You certainly haven't explained how.  ("voluntary" and
"coercion" in the same sentence?)
