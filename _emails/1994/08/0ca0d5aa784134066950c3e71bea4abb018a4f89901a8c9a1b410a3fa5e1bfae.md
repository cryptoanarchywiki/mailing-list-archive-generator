Here's another possibility.. We put out the word that we don't buy 
Chicago or any somftware that has SKE built in. KEep your old stuff or 
make your own operating system. I think most of the computer programmers 
could on joint effort create something better than what is on the market 
anyway.

We live in a democracy. We should be telling those assholes in Washington 
DC how we want the country run, not them telling us that we need NIST. 
Who are they representing anyway???
