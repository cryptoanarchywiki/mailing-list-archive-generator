*******************************************************************

   They have demonstrated that the Fed state will not tolerate an alt-
ternate cash system & repeatedly kill them. This is because they know
that an alternate cash system could be easily fashioned to kill them.
- as though there was any benefit to keeping the giant Federal parasite
alive.
   They have also demonstrated that the only in-US alternate cash system
that will survive is an alternate cash system that will florish without
the Feds permission. This implies anonymous e$ with encryption & remail-
ers. Chaum's e$ with an offshore clearinghouse comes to mind.
   I thought Peace'es more accurate description of a parasite & his
characterization of the Fed State as a parasite were particularly NICE:-
:-)  : -) :-)   :-)

   There are other evils of this monocash system. 1. It allows elite in-
siders to profit from secret Federal Reserve moves. 2 It allows a privat
organization (the Federal Reserve) to manipulate the US'es money system.
3. It is an anti-freedom monopoly of cash. 4. It kills experiments with
superior cash systems that would proliferate otherwise. & 5.It supresses
script driven barter systems that circumvent the frequent low volocity
problems with other instruments that is in conventional systems.-Some-
times most people hold their cash & wait for a buyer (with cash) before
they spend. That way everybody is waiting for someone to buy from them
before they buy. With script driven barter systems, you make script
by providing something. To restate this more clearly, in barter systems
business activity is encouraged. - The increased volocity of "cash"
is encouraged. Deals are more fluidly made & business (tranactions) are
encouraged.
