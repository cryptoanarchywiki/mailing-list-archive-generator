There was some discussion recently concerning problems which could arise
if the U.S. federal government had a medical database on its citizens.

One example of abuse of medical records is documented in the report of
the "Krever Royal Commission on the Confidentiality of Health Records",
published in 1980 in Canada.  In the particular case I'm citing, a (now
disbanded) RCMP (federal police) dirty-tricks squad obtained medical
records of a dissident, and used them for disruptive tactics.  Quoting
from page 45:

"The letter distributed at King Edward School attempted to use accurate 
health information to sow dissension, disruption and distrust among the
members of the Young Socialists.  The three letters were written and 
distributed by the RCMP.  Superintendent Ian William Taylor ... expressly
admitted that the letters addressed to Mr. Riddell and the letter 
distributed at the King Edward School were written by members of the RCMP
with the authorization of senior RCMP officers."

One of the letters begins as follows:

"COMRADE:

We have been most disturbed by indications of increasing emotional 
instability on your part, witnessed by psychiatric consultations, violent
outbursts of temper and frequent periods of irritability.  We note too
from the enclosed letter that your condition has not escaped the notice
of others."  (etc.)


Please note that I have no sympathy at all with the political objectives
of this group, but I think the incident is a good example of the sort of
abuse which can result when highly personal records are accessible by a
government.
