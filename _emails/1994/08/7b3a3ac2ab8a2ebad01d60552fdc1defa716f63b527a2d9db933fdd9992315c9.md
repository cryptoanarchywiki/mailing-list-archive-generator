Matthew Ghio was doing this for a while, and posted about it here
several times.

I told him I'd "subscribe to" a robust, stable, pinging service, one
that offered a table of various things, including:

- time in operation (important for deciding to use it or not)

- successful remails out of last N (e.g., "32 of last 34 attempts were
valid")

- maybe a _recent_ result (e.g., "5 out of 5 in last 24 hours were
valid")

- remailer policy, including encryption, logging, etc.

I still intend to pay Matthew once I get back to using such remailers
(I haven't in a long while) and can confirm that Matthew is indeed
offering a stable, robust, useful service. I doubt he'll maintain it
just for me, so maybe others of you can help. (I hate donation-based
systems, so clearly a true "subscription finger" or "subscription ftp"
would be better...and maybe fairly easy to implement, too.)
