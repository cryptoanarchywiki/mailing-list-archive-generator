But what does MPJ think of getting a 400K mailbomb? If you object, MPJ,
feel free to flame me and I'll stop sending them.

Someone please do. I can make the changes as needed tomorrow, if someone
posts the math results. I am anxious to play with a real live digicash
system, and transferring money between two directories on my hard drive
does not count.

Whoever has the Knuth book, please check this out. Maybe we should patent
this solution, if it works, and make Chaum pay us, since he patented his
blind signature protocol. :-)
