I agree completely with this. we have to move encryption onto the desktop
PCs and Macs, and make it transparent to the naive users. Eudora and NUpop
are a good start, but aren't transparent when you use PGP or ViaPGP.

I've written a non-TCP/IP Windows POP/SMTP client that will work with
commercial providers such as Netcom and Digex, but I can't get the low
level communications code to work - Window's comm.drv API is too flakey for
me to understand and get working.

I believe that my code is less than a week or two from being ready to
distrubute, if I can get some help with the communications code.
I asked a few months ago, and had one volunteer who didn't deliver.

I'd love to find a cypherpunk willing to work with me to provide some sorely
needed enabling technology.
