I'm quite satisfied with this clarification (as if it matters to any  
but me).

Still, I believe labeling your efforts a "disinformation campaign"  
was a mistake.  It gives the pro-Clipper people something to throw  
back in your face.  How about changing "disinformation campaign" to  
"education campaign"?  It has a more positive sound to it and doesn't  
limit you to only dry facts.  Education through speculation,  
hyperbole, and satire can be effective and is ethical if the reader  
can recognize when you are engaging in speculation, hyperbole, or  
satire (my opinion, of course).
