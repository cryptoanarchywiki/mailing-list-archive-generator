The program was designed to accept improvements in the encryption
transparently, so I did plan ahead. :)  I can add encryption algorythms,
and have the software accept addresses of both the old and new ciphers. 
I didn't happen to have any DES/IDEA code handy when I was programming
it, so I just used what I had.  Since several people have expressed
concern about the encryption, I will add another encryption layer
consisting of either DES or IDEA.
