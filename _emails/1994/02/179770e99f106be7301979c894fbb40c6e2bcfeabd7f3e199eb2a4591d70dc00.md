The invention (discovery?) of public-key crypto changed the world, and
makes practical everyday use of crypto infinitely easier.  It also makes
the kinds of specific things cypherpunks are interested in much more
practical (or POSSIBLE).  If you correspond with hundreds of people on a
regular basis, including people you don't know and people you may send
something to once and never deal with again, it is impractical to say the
least to have to generate and exchange keys.  That's the basic argument.
Why was public key crypto invented at all?  Why are people interested in
using it?  Practically, it's really fundamentally different from symmetric
crypto, which is of very limited use in the situation we're all in now
(anonymous communication, the net, quick hit-and-run dissemination of
information, digital signatures, etc., etc.).  PGP also has the "web of
trust" structure built in.  This is worlds away from basic symmetric
crypto.

This is really basic stuff, so I'm hesitant to discuss it on the list.

If you're relatively new to the list, try to get your hands on some of the
basic cypherpunk material, like tcmay's Crypto-Anarchy manifesto, the
cypherpunk articles in Wired or Whole Earth Review, etc.  There are many
different views represented on the list, but I think we all agree on the
significance and importance of pk crypto.

Symmetric is fine for hiding things from your boss.  PK is intended for
different purposes.

I didn't mean to insult PGP by claiming that it's worth the price ($0).  It's
actually worth much more.  I was just saying that for free it's an astounding
deal.
