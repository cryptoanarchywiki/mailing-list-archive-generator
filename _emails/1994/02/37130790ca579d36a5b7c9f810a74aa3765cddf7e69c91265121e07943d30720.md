Sorry I'm years behind in my list reading...

Mike, recall the precedents.  FDA burning of Reich's books in the '50s as 
"labeling for an unlawful medical device" -- the Orgone Accumulator.  
Likewise FDA seizures of Scientolgy literature in the '60s as "labeling 
for an unlawful medical device" -- E-meters.  Then there are the moves 
against vitamin literature in recent FDA raids.  I don't think the courts 
have ever faced the specific issue of regulatory censorship.

DCF

Then there's the time in the early '80s when the Consumer Products Safety 
Commission banned the "Button Book."
