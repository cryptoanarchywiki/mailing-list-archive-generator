Cypherpunks do have an interest in all forms of crypto, but there are
very good reasons why public key is more desirable than symmetric for "our
purposes."  This is at the very root of the crypto revolution and the
cypherpunk ethos.  Have you done the basic reading?  (That's a serious
question, not sarcasm.)

PGP _does_ symmetric crypto.

And MacPGP comes with IDEA, which is at least as strong (as far as we know).
And of course, it does all the public-key encryption and key-management as
well.  A pretty incredible package, considering its size and cost.

I disagree.

Hmmm...
