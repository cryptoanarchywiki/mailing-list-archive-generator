ATM = Asynchronous Transfer Mode. This is a switched service running at at
least 155 Mb/sec using optical fiber. 600Mb are expected to follow not much
later. A single strand to customer premises provides that bandwidth full
duplex. The strand provides for many multiplexed virtual circuits a bit
like X.25 except that it will probably be priced according to a bandwidth
selected at call setup and you will be prevented from exceeding that rate
during the call. This service should be sufficient for video. Simillar
technologies are being built for local LANs where each computer has a full
duplex 155 Mb potential instead of the aggregate 10Mb provided by Ethernet.
