Perry,

Much better flame. Thanks for making me laugh :-) .

I do start to understand your outlook, but I also understand
people like Larry and that makes me quite apprehensive about
quick fixes. What do you think about moderated remailers? If
the code was set up so I never SEE the addresses involved,
only the contents, it would have about the same security as
current remailers, as far as having to trust the operator.

It would put an abrupt end to Detweiler abuses, and solve
Usenet abuses, but not solve "encrypted death threats".
But I don't think even Larry will be sending those to people.

"Making his life easy", or making it harder, just doesn't register
in my mind as being a real issue. Seems to me he would ENJOY
it being harder, for that means we are all paying great attention
to him, and he can upset us SO much more by abusing the remailers
to spoil our quick fix.
