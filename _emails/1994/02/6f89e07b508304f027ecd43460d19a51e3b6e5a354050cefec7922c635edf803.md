Try the 9th Amendment on for size:

"The enumeration in the Costitution, of certain rights, shall not be 
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."

Privacy was a long recognized right in Anglo-American juris prudence.  It 
goes all the way back to the very English idea that "a man's home is his 
castle."
