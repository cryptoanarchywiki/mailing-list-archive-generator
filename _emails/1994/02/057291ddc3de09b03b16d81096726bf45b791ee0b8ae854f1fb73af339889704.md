 Eric,
 In your idea to give usenet users a chance to have competing moderated groups
with unmoderated ones.Don't you think that the large numbers who want a 
moderated group will kill all demand for the unmoderated ones?Then we would be
left with only moderated groups,who grated would have more signal to noise but
less lively debate.People post so much to groups because they know they can in
a free manner,moderation would slow the onslaught of banal posts and plenty of
posts from folks who think thier ideas too wild for the moderator.Remember the
root of moderator is moderate.As in,"This food is moderately good."
