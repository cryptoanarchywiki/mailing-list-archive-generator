I don't think the issue is "telling the truth" or not, telling the truth
is the only way to go in this instance if the kind of world that Clipper
-- and Bill Casey's top Russian specialist being a spy -- represents
is not to self-perpetuate.  The backlash to Clipper is a big jab in the
eye to the thoroughly self-indulgent and self-righteous "intelligence
establishment" of which people like Dorothy Denning are only the willing
lapdogs.  

The American people are squarely on our side on this as long as they are
presented with a fair statement of the question: do you want the 
government to have the right to see or hear every single piece of
electronic information written by you, to you or about you?  

The struggle is not over whether to tell the truth, or whether there is
enough time to tell the whole truth.  The struggle is to find a message
that encapulizes all of our technical and political and personal misgivings
with this system *and* the forces driving it forward, make that message
accessible to the broad public and make sure that the public hears it and
has a chance to make it the real fulcrum of decision.
