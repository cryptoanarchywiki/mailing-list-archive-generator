Sandy, please re-read what I said... "private communication".  If this were 
a right, then wiretapping AT ALL would be illegal, and it is not.

Don't get me wrong.  I am all for private communications.  I'm very much 
against restricting the public's access to encryption technology.  What gets 
me is when everyone runs around saying "this is a right".
