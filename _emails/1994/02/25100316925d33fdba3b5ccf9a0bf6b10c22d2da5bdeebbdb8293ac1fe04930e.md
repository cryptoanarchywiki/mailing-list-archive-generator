Lucky me. I got my first complaint about my remailer today, as Eric
Hollander told me I would eventually get. He says once a month Mr. Employee
bashes Mr. Boss with his remailer 'cause Mr. Employee is too cheap for a
stamp, and so he sends Mr. Employee a nasty warning from Mr. Remailer
Operator. Me, no logs, yet, even assuming it wasn't just from another
remailer. And the person didn't contact me, he contacted Netcom. Gee, maybe
the guy made it up. No matter. It was an edu address, possibly a student.
So now I get a terse, not too serious message from support@netcom.com
mentioning "unsolicited mail" being against Netcom policy, so cut it out.
I've blocked that outgoing address and sent the guy an explanation, and he
hasn't responded to my asking what was up. I've added "Report Problems to
qwerty@netcom.com." in my outgoing header too. But I have a question.

I'm the quite type. I tend to ignore things like this, till say Netcom
deletes my account, or at least demands an explanation. My question is,
should this happen again, say tomorrow, should I tell support@netcom.com
what's up? "I'm running an anonymous remailer, you know, like
anon.penet.fi, the one that has 10,000 active users. Thus Netcom is now
diverting CPU time to anyone who wants it." I wouldn't word it like THAT,
but that's what they might truthfully assume. Sure would be nice if I could
fully forge e-mail as coming from "nobody@nowhere.org". Alternatively I
could just keep logs. Or I could just never log into qwerty again, and see
how long it lasts ;-)! Hit and run remailer accounts.

Centralized remailers on the internet. Bah!
