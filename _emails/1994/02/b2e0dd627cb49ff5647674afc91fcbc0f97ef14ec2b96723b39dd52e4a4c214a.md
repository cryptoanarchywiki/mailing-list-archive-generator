Sorry for being unclear. This is what I was trying to say:

I am an anarchist and don't like Nazis. However, I believe that everyone
should have the right to say what they believe needs to be said. By making
it illegal to let certain parts of society know how to start a newspaper
(assuming this is true), the German government employs the very same
principles it is trying to fight. Furthermore, I believe that a government
in power that use fascist methods (such as taking away one's right to
publsh a paper) is more dangerous to society as a whole than some juvenile
hotheads, whose crazy ideas probably would be rather discredited than being
help by putting out for everyone to read.

As for the analogy to the US: I see the constant increase in attempts to
censor the media as a warning that perhaps some day soon it may be illegal
to tell someone in the US how to go about publishing your own paper.


Peace,
