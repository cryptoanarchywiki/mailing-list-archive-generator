Interesting stuff, though it really belongs on comp.eff.org.talk
or other netnews groups rather than in cypherpunks;
we've talked about it a bit, but the major cypherpunk issues
are encryption policy and how much we'll be able to engage in 
free speech if the state-capitalists manage to steal the nets from the
emerging free market.  (Oh, wait, that's flame bait, isn't it?  Sorry :-)

Followup-To: comp.org.eff.talk   -- Thanks;  Bill
