Eric talks about a hypothetical system S which he discussed with
real acquaintance X of country C (with repressive government G), 
for stegging information I in through exogenously-produced CDs of 
indigenous music M.

One problem is that S is proposed for use by lots of people in C.
That means the whole system won't be a secret for long.  Soon
G will know not only which records and which equipment to ban, but
also the passphrases for the records--so why encrypt or even
camoflage it?

Maybe making copies of existing popular records would help.
Classics that lots of people already have.  Are there already 
records produced for C but manufactured outside of C?  Do they 
import music popular outside C?

Maybe the newsgroup you mention is just the thing for the second-to-
last step in the chain.  It can combine efforts of people who don't 
have to know each other.

Can most CR ROM drives read the raw music format?  Many?
If not, can the bit stream to the ADC in a CD player be intercepted?
Maybe the best hardware from a physical camoflage standpoint would be 
those little CDROM drives that double as "walkmen".

Isn't it good enough to always start with sentences invented by 
people and encode into bits?

I think when they're not giving you exactly what you put in, they're
doing desparate things like repeating the last few milliseconds.  So
about all you can do is put CRCs and IDs on blocks (maybe small 
blocks?) and be able to deal with lost and misplaced blocks.
It might be useful to have signatures on block boundaries so you could
recognize them out of continuous streams.  Maybe you would just take
two blocks worth of data and slide your buffer along one byte at a
time till you got a good CRC...but by then you would have received
a lot more data.  Better have a long buffer.

Here, too, you need to deal with lost blocks.  Having one copy of the
root of the index might not be great.  Also, assuming you're using
modified CD players instead of CDROM drives, you might want to take
advantage of the music track structure.
