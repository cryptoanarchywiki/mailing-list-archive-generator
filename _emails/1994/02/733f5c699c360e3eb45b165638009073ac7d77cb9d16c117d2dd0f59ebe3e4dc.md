Apple's CD-300/300i drives can read audio bits directly and turn them
into a QuickTime sound channel, as can SGI's SCSI CD. Apple uses a
Sony mechanism, and SGI uses a Toshiba. The SGI drives use modified
firmware and (AFAIK) are not available elsewhere, but you can get the
Apple drives at Circuit City, Sears, etc.

With the right sequence of SCSI commands you could easily capture an
"audio" bitstream, then munge it as desired to extract the stegged
data, play it backwards, or whatever. IIR, code to directly read
arbitrary audio data on an Apple CD-ROM was recently posted in
comp.sys.mac.programmer, but I didn't save it.
