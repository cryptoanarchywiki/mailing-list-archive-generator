Actually, in it's simplest form, it is much easier to hide files by 
deleting them than by implementing an alternative file system.  
Theoretically, the former method should be enough for most of those 
concerned with having telltale "noise" files on their disks.  Using an 
alternative file system might, for them, be almost as revealing as having 
"noise" files.

We can assume that the legitimate user would be aware of this drawback, 
and would take measures not to write over the files he has hidden.
I see no absolute _need_ to modify the filesystem.  A simple utility that 
can write files to specific disk locations is all that is required.

This is only a problem if you modify the filesystem.  The standard 
filesystem will simply write over the deleted files; or, if one is using 
the above mentioned utility, one would write onto a truely free portion 
of the disk.  We can assume that the only an intruder would unknowingly 
write a file onto the disk without using the special utility (thus 
overwriting the hidden encrypted file, and doing the legitimate user a 
favor by destroying the evidence).

                  All feedback welcome,

                       Sergey


PS: I agree with your statement about "security through obscurity"
    sometimes being a good practical solution.
