Thanks Karl, but after picking up the FAQ I saw all sorts of interesting things
on Digital Cash etc. Now Gopher is about the most painful method of getting
info if you know what you want, and I can't even run it in the background.

I've picked up most of the *text* files from soda.berkeley.edu//pub/cypherpunks,
and it would definetely be more convenient for people like me, who prefer to 
download everything onto gig drives and browse through them at leisure, if
chaos.bsu.edu info was available at an FTP site... At least the DC stuff is
NOT at soda.

WWW is a decent method of accessing info, and I'm making htmls of all the
docs I've picked up. If someone makes chaos' docs available through FTP, I'd
be happy to include and release a WWW 'Guide to C*punks'.
