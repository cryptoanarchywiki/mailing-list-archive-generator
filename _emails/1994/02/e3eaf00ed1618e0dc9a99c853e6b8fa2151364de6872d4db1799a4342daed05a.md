Any software for hiding data in fractals would have the problem that
people would eventually learn to recognize the type of fractal.  Thus
when the FBI digs through your PC, they'd find the fractals, and recognize
them as data carriers.	Hiding data in arbitrary .jpg files would solve
this problem, but even so, if the FBI knows there is software for
hiding data in the low bits of .jpg files, they'd run it on all your
pictures as a matter of course.  Naturally you'll have encrypted your
file, but you may as well have left it on the disk as is.

a) What's stenography?
b) What's stegography?
c) There's nothing self-decrypting about a .jpg file.
