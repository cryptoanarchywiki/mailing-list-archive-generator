I disagree that this is censorship.  This is an issue that comes up
again and again in anarchist circles.  Censorship is understandably
a thorny issue, especially among anti-authoritarians.  However, I'm
certain that this isn't it.  Anarchy is all about decentralization (I'm
trying to give a definition that all the different types of @'s on this
list can agree with).  When some central authority like the state tells
you you can't publish something or say something in public, that's
censorship.  When I as a small publisher say "You're a Nazi, and I'm not
going to publish your stuff" (something like this came up with a book I
recently edited), that's me telling you that I'm not going to let you
use my resources to print your shit.  In a free, decentralized "economy"
people get to decide how they want to make use of their own facilities.

We are not obligated to let any lunatic in the world use the network that
we've painstakingly set up and nurtured to trash that network or smear
our names.  We can argue among ourselves about policies, etc., but I
don't think we need to show how anti-authoritarian we are by putting out
a welcome mat for saboteurs, provocateurs, or whoever.

All in all, I think people have been pretty tolerant of LD.
