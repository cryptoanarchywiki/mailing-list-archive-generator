RFC 822 says nothing about the interpretation of the "local-part" of an
address.  (Actually, it says "The local-part [...] is understood to be
whatever the receiving mail protocol server allows.")  RFC 822 also says
that the "+" character is permitted to appear within an unquoted "atom" as
part of an address.  In other words, RFC 822 allows addresses of the form
user+misc@domain (with some restrictions on the form of the "user+misc"
string), but says nothing about how they should be interpreted. 

It is currently fashionable to treat mail to "user+misc@domain" similarly
to mail to "user@domain", with the "misc" string being somehow made
available for extra interpretation by the delivery software; but there is
no Internet standard for this.
