Oh, well, I guess I don't suppose that's what you meant.

Because the latter is a class of the former?

Well, I suppose there are some extremes which could get you in trouble
(like, in particular, something directly threatening to the President,
though I've never completely understood the Constitutional
justification for such a thing).  I don't think "Mein Kampf" is
anywhere near the extreme.  It's hateful and wrong, but it is a book
of ideas and deserves to be available.

Not by restricting press freedoms.

You did!  I'm not trying to be inflammatory; that's what I thought you
said!  I asked whether anybody could print a newspaper, and you said
something like "as long as they register" or something.  Perhaps I
misunderstood; I foolishly did not save your note.

Oh; OK, then I take it back.  I wish I had saved the note you wrote
earlier; I must have severely misinterpreted it.

 > What is the use of press freedom if the press doesn't use it?

Well, that's sort of a different problem.  There are outlets for a
wide variety of ideas, but they're not the major news networks or
newspapers.

As I said, I simply misinterpreted what you wrote.

Actually, no; I don't call it that.  One of the reasons I'm "here" is
that I don't like the restrictions!
