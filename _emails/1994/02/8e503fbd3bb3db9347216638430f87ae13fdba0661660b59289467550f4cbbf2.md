"The reasons the Post Office gets more slack are that
1) They're the government, or at least used to be
2) They can randomly open mail when they feel like it, see 1)"

So what's your point? Talk is cheap. The situation remains the same.
The message in my post remains valid. The reason why it is so doesn't matter
to someone desiring privacy. The internet still sucks and always will, due
to the From and Received by e-mail headers as well as many other Unix system
problems like sendmail logs, and the fact that you can't trust a wire 'cause
you can't see it.
