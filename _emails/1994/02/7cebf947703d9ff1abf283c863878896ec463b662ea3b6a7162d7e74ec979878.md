I don't have ftp (or Internet) access either. Try using
one of BITFTP (BITnet FTP I think) services. Automated info
response will be send to you upon sending mail with message body
containing word "help" (without quotes) to one of the following
addresses:
bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu or
bitftp@pucc.bitnet (located in USA)
bitftp@plearn.edu.pl  or
bitftp@plearn.bitnet (located in Central Europe)

Just before onset of twenty first century such ftp 'access'
may seem ridiculous but it really works as I have transferred
megabytes of data this way.

Good Luck !

Doodeck.
