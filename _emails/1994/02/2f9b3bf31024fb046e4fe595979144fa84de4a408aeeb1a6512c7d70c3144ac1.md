	(Could some exi-bayer please forward this to the main
Extropians list? I've been busy lately and unsubbed. Thanks.)

	This young motivated, energetic, talented cypherpunk is in
search of some sort of summer position, internship, whathaveyou which
will use his skills to the fullest.
	I've been hacking UNIX for the past three and a half years
now, and I've been employed using UNIX for the past semester. I've
been spending much time outside of class & work learning perl and
other fun elements of UNIX-- I've installed linux and xwindows on my
roommate's 486. I've recently been working on a fully anonymous anon
server which protects users against direct attacks upon the server
itself.
	Although I spend a great deal of time outside class learning
to administrate my local machine, I have still found the time to do
well in my classes. I plan on majoring in both Computer Science and
Physics because they are both so compelling that I can't choose one or
the other.
	While I would prefer a position which is BARTable from
Berkeley, because I don't own a car, I can probably get a car if
needed.
