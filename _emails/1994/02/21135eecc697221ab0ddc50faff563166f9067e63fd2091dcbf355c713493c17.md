 Anyone who is intrested in T.A.Z should also check out a short story from the
Science Fiction anthology Semiotext SF,"Visit Port Watson".It's wierd how much
the story resembles T.A.Z.The mythical Port Watson is located on the real islandof Sonsorol in the South China Sea,about 400 miles from The Philippines.The Portis a free enclave,a enclave with no laws of any kind.The inhabitants of the island recieve dividends from a bank who has only virtual money.Each citizen recieves and equal share of the dividends which is calculated by computer based on money made by investors.The Bankers are "libertarian computer hacks and anarcho-capitilists".Sounds like CypherPunk Nation to me.Here's the bibiliography info;
 Semiotext(E) SF Copyright 1989 Autonomedia,New York.Ed.Peter Lamborn Wilson andRudy Rucker.
