  Well, anyone who is the group which owns mqueue (you need to do an ls -ldg
  to show this info) can read the directory and (likely) the logs.  It would
  not be unusual for the daemon or bin id's to be allowed read access to these
  files/directories, so anyone who could exploit the latest sendmail bug
  could end up reading those files...

  And that doesn't even go into the potential access by legitimate sysadmins
  who may not care too much about other users' privacy...

  As would I.

  Good advice.  Caveat Emptor!

  Here is an example of what sendmail might log to syslog:

Feb  2 12:31:18 localhost: 15068 sendmail: AA15068: message-id= \
		<199402021713.JAA08629@mail.netcom.com>
Feb  2 12:31:18 localhost: 15068 sendmail: AA15068: from= \
		<owner-cypherpunks@toad.com>, size=4402, class=0, \
		received from mailer.psc.edu (128.182.62.100)
Feb  2 12:31:19 localhost: 15070 sendmail: AA15068: to=<boone@igi.psc.edu>, \
		delay=00:00:13, stat=Sent

I have re-formatted the lines to make them easier to read...  This is the log
of you sending this mail to me...

Here's my previous response, which I sent to the list, logged again...

Feb  2 10:00:27 localhost: 11889 sendmail: AA11889: message-id= \
			   <9402021500.AA11889@igi.psc.edu>
Feb  2 10:00:27 localhost: 11889 sendmail: AA11889: from=<boone@igi.psc.edu>,
			   size=1391, class=0, received from local
Feb  2 10:00:31 localhost: 11891 sendmail: AA11889: to=<cypherpunks@toad.com>,
			   delay=00:00:04, stat=Sent

And here's the list sending it back to me...

Feb  2 10:19:09 localhost: 13086 sendmail: AA13086: message-id= \
			   <9402021500.AA11889@igi.psc.edu>
Feb  2 10:19:09 localhost: 13086 sendmail: AA13086: from= \
			   <owner-cypherpunks@toad.com>, size=2028, class=0, \
			   received from mailer.psc.edu (128.182.62.100)
Feb  2 10:19:11 localhost: 13089 sendmail: AA13086: to=<boone@igi.psc.edu>, \
			   delay=00:00:02, stat=Sent

If the mailer recieves a lot of messages, then it would not be easy (if at all
possible to correlate the messages received with the id's that they were sent
out to...).  If the traffic load is small, then correlation is fairly easy.

Similarly, if the load is very high, it might become easier -- if I set up a 
script which sent mail to a particular anonid every 2 seconds or so, I would
probably be able to correlate, given access to the syslog logs.  Of course,
I could forgo the logs and just look at the packets passed on your network,
but we were discussing the use of the syslog logs.

  Aside from traffic obscuring random messages, a forced, random delay and
  a medium sized load of traffic seem to be the best ways to defeat the use
  of the syslog logs.  Disabling syslog calls in sendmail (or whatever you
  use for SMTP) would be an even better tack to take.  Remember folks, even
  if I can't get root when the machine is up, I may be able to force it into
  single-user mode and access the logs then -- physical security of the 
  machines [as well as software security] is an important consideration of
  *any* remailer you use.

  I'm not advising you to not be a remailer, but you should be aware of the
  potential holes -- even if you can't do anything about them...

  If you're concerned with your own personal privacy, I can't think of a
  good way to ensure that you will not be "outed" from your anon-id.
  Even if you use a personal machine which connects to the network via a
  dialup slip IP pool, the provider is likely to keep logs of what machines
  have access to that pool and who their owners are...  And, of course, a
  permanent connection (T1 or the like) is a dead give-away...

  We really need the IP security -- the proposal put forward by Mssr. Blaze
  and Mssr. Ioannidis for encrypted-IP would help.. but you still rely on
  having the other side *not* log...
