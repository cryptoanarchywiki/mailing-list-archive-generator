I recently decided that running a remailer from this account
might be a good idea. To help the over all good.  It is "out of
country" for most of you, so it will make one more hop that will
be harder for LE to get at from wherever you are.  But I also
want to protect my account as much as possible, so I would like
to ONLY remail to other remailers. (As they are much less likely
to complain to my sysadmin than any other recipient)  Does anyone
have remailer software that could be easily changed to remail to
a limited set of adresses?  If so I would be interested in
helping the cause, if not I probably will go back to being a
"watcher" from the sidelines..

PS. Did I really read that someone said that Canada was a
Socialist country with limited free speach?
