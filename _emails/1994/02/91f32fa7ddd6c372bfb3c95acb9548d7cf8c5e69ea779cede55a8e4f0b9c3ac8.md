  Is the sendmail (I assume you are using sendmail for SMTP services) daemon
  set up so that it *doesn't* log to /usr/spool/mqueue/syslog [or any other
  syslog facility]?  Otherwise, it may well be possible to track the usage
  of the remailer through browsing the syslog logs.

  This is one of the problems (it seems to me) with using a remailer and
  *not* having root access.  Unless you can convince your sysadmin to
  remove the syslog mechanism that sendmail uses, you may be exposing your
  users (presumably by accident).
