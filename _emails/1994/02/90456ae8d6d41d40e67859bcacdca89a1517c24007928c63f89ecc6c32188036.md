I did not consider that a flame war, it was just a bit of banter.

You seem to lack both a sense of humor, and the intelligence to discern 
it in others.

As for re-posting personal mail, there is nothing unethical about it.  
Your vehemence on this point just goes to prove how much you wanted to 
hide your true personality from those on the net.

Since you don't seem to want to end this, I will.  Post all you want, 
personal and private.  You have proven beyond a doubt that you have no 
points of view worth discussing, nothing to be learned, and nothing worth 
replying to.
