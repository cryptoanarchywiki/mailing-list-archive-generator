The following letter was received anonymously via USPS, postmarked "SUBURBAN
MD MSC 206, 19 FEB 94 PM, and printed using an HP DeskJet printer in 12 point
courier type.  I thought that I would share it with you, not because I agree
with it (I don't), but because I thought that it was interesting that it has
been the ONLY comment I have received on my paper that expressed
disagreement.  Note that the entertaining mis-spelling of "imperfect writing"
is the original author's, and not mine.  For a copy of the paper I refer to,
ftp csn.org:\mpj\cryptusa.* or see my posting in alt.privacy and
talk.politics.crypto

Re:  Data Encryption Software and Technical Data Controls in the
United States of America

     Read  your  document.   You  made very sweeping statements.
Obviously, you are not an expert for all the material addressed.
Educated people, when not an  expert,  cite  to  references  for
positions articulated in a paper.

     One  example  of  your imprefect writting style is the "law
enforcement" section.  You never mentioned  or  solved  the  law
enforcement  community's  efforts  in  detecting the transfer of
illegal drugs.

     Your paper needs a major rewrite.

FROM:  Not Impressed

****************************************************************

I won't waste time on a rebuttal.  I just want to say that I consider traffic
in harmful drugs to be a major problem.  I'm not willing to give up my
Constitutional rights in the War on Drugs, but I am glad that there are law
enforcement agents who are intelligent enough to be a real threat to
criminals without being a threat to the honest citizens that they are hired
to protect.  In fact, I believe that the vast majority of law enforcement
agents fall in this category.

Just say "NO!" to harmful drugs, promiscuous sex, the ITAR's restrictions on
strong cryptography, and Key Escrow!  Write YOUR Congressional Representative
NOW and express support for Maria Cantwell's bill to ease restrictions on
privacy software!
