Perhaps so, but the Supreme Court saying something does not a "right" make. 
 Free speech is a right which does NOT allow anyone to say anything they 
wish, and it does not guarantee privacy from government interferance so long 
as there is probable cause for law enforcement to interfere.

Remember as well, you must ASK the government for permission to sue it, 
which is how something gets to the Supreme Court, after possibly years of 
expenses.

Not to mention that many agencies don't NEED ANY approval to take actions. 
 Notice the FBI/CIA recent mole... they have not been found guilty, yet 
every belonging has been forfeited.  Of course, everyone's "pretty sure" 
they're guilty, but ...
