Precisely a point I've been making for some time.

We are safest if we quickly deploy so much crypto that grandmothers
are using it and they EXPECT it everywhere. That way, crypto is not a
signal that something is unusual. Steganography never took off as a
science largely because it is such a weak form of protection, almost
inherently. As soon as they SUSPECT steganography you have immediately
lost any safety you may have had.

I'm very much in favor of simply openly using crypto, as often as
possible and as visibly as possible.
