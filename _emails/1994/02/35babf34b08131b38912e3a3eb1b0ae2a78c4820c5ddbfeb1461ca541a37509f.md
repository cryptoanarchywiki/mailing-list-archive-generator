Yes, I remember that now about w but I believe that m should be prime.

Absolutely correct.

Again, correct.

Oops, one more check of those equations and that would probabaly have
jumped out at me.  Sorry for swapping them (but as a newbie here I now
know that you folks have your chops (a drumming term) when it comes
to the math of this stuff.)

Well, any two pair of boxes that are going to employ this have to use
the same numbers obviously so they will be available to crunch any
given exchange against and the only thing anyone can "focus their
efforts" on is the exchange itself and I don't think knowing w amd
m for a long time helps that problem any.

I am just think that a pair should be selected, every implementation
should use them to help with interoperability and they should be
defined with simply stated, remembered and coded algorithms rather
than just a long string of digits.

Ah, I assumed it did somewhere because Phil and I had a fair bit of
email about this last year and he convinced me that D-H was the way to
go because cracking one session gives no help toward breaking the next
one.

Maybe larger but I'll bet a lot easier to remember.  :-)  The slowness
need not be a factor since a developer only need generate them once and
save them in non-volatile ram which will be required for public keys
anyway.  If they just exist as numbers, we have to get them on some
media that we can then use to transfer them into a device or type them
in.  It just seems easier if a simple algorithm could be specified.
I'm not anal about this I just thought it an easier way and one that
is more likely to insure interoperability.


Peace,

Bob
