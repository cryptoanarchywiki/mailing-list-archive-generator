I can't take life seriously enough to censor old Larry.
I can't take the IDEAL of the First Amendment lightly
enough to do so either. And afterall, he wasn't the
one who wrote that "Blacknet" blurb. I find it amusing
to see uptight fuck-wads from specialized narrow minded
Usenet groups yelling about someone sending something to
their precious little group that upset them. Abuse away
Larry. Show us that we really DO need dumb optical fibers
between laptops instead of this tight-assed RFC standardized
World Wide Wiretap we call our playground. We need a new
net guys.
