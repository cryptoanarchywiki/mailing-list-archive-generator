I will indeed shoot at anyone that is trying to shoot at me. Tell me,
are the Nazis currently censoring you in Germany? In any case,
reasoning by analogy is specious. My point was very simple: a free
country is one in which people may speak their mind. You cannot keep a
country free by imposing censorship; it is a contradiction in terms.

Using your own criterion, the censorship hasn't worked either.

Let us say rather that it is not possible to prevent cryptographic
software from being used by Nazis and I would rather see it available
to all rather than to be used only by the Nazis. Any system which
could stop Nazis from using cryptographic software would involve so
much wholesale monitoring of all communications as to eliminate the
benefits of fighting Naziism.

It is not enough to defeat the Nazis -- one must also avoid destroying
the thing which one wants to preserve, which is freedom. If the price
of destroying Nazis is to destroy the thing you were trying to
protect, you have done no good.

Are you telling me that if I were to write in a newspaper "all Turks
should be killed" that this would be legal under German law? I was
under the impression that you cannot.

Then by definition yours cannot be good, because yours is unfree.

Yes. In fact, many magazines are published with nude women in front.
You may have difficulty finding places willing to sell them, however.

Religious groups control religious institutions. They do not control
our government. Is it your contention that religious groups do not
control your religious institutions? In any case, what does this have
to do with freedom? If one chooses to go to a church, for instance,
what is wrong with that per se?
