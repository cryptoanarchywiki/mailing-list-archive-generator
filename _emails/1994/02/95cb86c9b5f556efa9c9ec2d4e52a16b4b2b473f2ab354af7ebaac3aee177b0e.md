  This is one of the problems (it seems to me) with using a remailer and
  *not* having root access.  Unless you can convince your sysadmin to
  remove the syslog mechanism that sendmail uses, you may be exposing your
  users (presumably by accident)."

No, fortunately for other users, I do not have root access on Netcom ;-).
So who is going to be doing this browsing? Other Netcom users can't read
the mqueue:

qwerty: cd /usr/spool
qwerty: ls
cron        lpd.lock    news        news4       uucp

lpd         mqueue      news3       secretmail  uumaps
qwerty: cd mqueue
mqueue: Permission denied
qwerty: ls -la

I'm using Hal's remailer, so ask him the details of what I have running.
How many of those private sites with remailers having root, keep NO personal
logs? Any? I would like to compile a more detailed listing of the details
about each remailer's capabilities, situation, and policy statements.

If someone sends anonymous mail through my mailer victimizing someone in
a criminal manner, and law enforcement convinces Netcom to check the logs,
then more power to them. If someone sends mail discussing large doses of
vitamin C, when vitamin supplementys are banned a year from now, and the
FDA wants to arrest them, and Netcom allows them to see the mqueue then
that would be unfortunate indeed. I am running a remailer. Here is the
situation. What more can I offer? I would ask people to look at the
various remailers and ask in a street smart practical manner what the
pros and cons of each one is.

What, exactly, does the mqueue record? How long does it get saved? I
needed remailers to maintain some simple privacy by distancing myself
from the character Xenon. No 5AM fone calls and letters from people
asking me to send them PGP.... I figured if I was going to become the
largest volume user of the remailers, I should become a remailer
myself. The other option was to use the Netcom account to directly
mail out what I am sending to people, but that wasn't as fun of an
idea.
