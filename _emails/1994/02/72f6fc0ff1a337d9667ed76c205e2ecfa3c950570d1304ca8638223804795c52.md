Should be reasonably easy to implement depending on at what point.
A drop in replacement for serial.device (most all term programs and 
BBS's would most likely support this) wouldn't be healthy as at
the handshaking would have to be done unencrypted until a session-key
was established.  Perhaps if the serial.device were written to use
the normal serial.device and except a certain escape sequence that
could be sent to the serial.device as normal output that would
be intercepted as a key of some sort.  

Other options include a shared library that an application would have
to look for and use.  (This would of course involve a rewrite of
all the term soft, etc.)  

In any case, a sorta standard using pgp to exchange session keys
seems like a good idea.  Something worth noting though, the internet
is a packet network and most bbs via modem just stream things don't they?
I suppose you might have to use a stream cipher or just have the 
BBS/Term soft wait until you have an IDEA blocks worth, or a certain
time limit then crypt and send.
