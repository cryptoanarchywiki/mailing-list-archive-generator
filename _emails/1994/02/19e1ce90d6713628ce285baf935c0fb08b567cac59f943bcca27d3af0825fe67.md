To keep black market forgery part off the market, a 30% tolerance is way
more than enough. There should be no false negatives (making a real part
look fake), but if 1/3 of the forgeries slip through (i.e. 2/3 don't), this
has the affect of driving the forgery price up by a factor of 3,
effectively pricing them out of the market. (Unless the real goods are
overpriced a factor of 3...:-)
