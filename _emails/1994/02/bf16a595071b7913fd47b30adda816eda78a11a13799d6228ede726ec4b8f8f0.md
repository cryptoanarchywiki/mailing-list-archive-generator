Yes, I must have.  Thank you for mailing it to me!

It would be alright if someone checks the deleted sectors.  They would indeed
find your "noise" file; but, it would be embedded in rest of the noise
surrounding it (which would be provided by the other deleted files on the 
disk).

Thus, the original problem (ie. how to keep "noise" files inconspicuous) is
solved.

They would.  But, combined with "Stealth PGP" (ie. encryption without 
telltale headers) searching through all the deleted noise (which could be 
legitimate for all they know) would be futile.

Simple.  You would take note of the starting address of the file.  And, 
the length of the file.

This problem is solved by simply using a utility that writes directly to the
disk (exactly in the specified sectors, in the specified order), instead 
of letting DOS fragment your disk.

I am not familiar with the blank track you speak of; but, of course, if 
everyone keeps hiding their data in the same location it will not remain
hidden for long.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Matt!
