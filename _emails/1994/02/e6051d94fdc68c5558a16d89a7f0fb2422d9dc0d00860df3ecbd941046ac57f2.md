  Clipper Petition Passes 10,000
===========================================================

                                                        Washington, DC
                                                        February 15, 1994
                    



            Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)


                  OVER 10,000 SIGN PETITION TO OPPOSE CLIPPER


In only two weeks, over 10,000 users of the nation's computer networks
have signed the CPSR petition calling for President Clinton to withdraw
the Clipper proposal. 

Opposition has been widespread, from CEOs of large firms to college
students in small towns, from librarians and civil libertarians to computer
programmers and product marketers. 

To sign the petition, email <clipper.petition@cpsr.org> with the message
"I Oppose Clipper" 

Encourage friends to sign.

In 1990, over 30,000 people sent email message to Lotus asking that a
product
containing detailed personal information called "Marketplace" be withdrawn.
Eventually Lotus withdrew the product.

CPSR is a non-profit, membership organization based in Palo Alto, CA. 
CPSR's mission is to provide analysis of the effects of new technological 
developments on society.  For more information, please email cpsr@cpsr.org
or 
call 415-322-3778.
