Fortunately, attacks requiring large quantities of known or chosen
plaintext aren't very relevant to secure email, since typically
each message has a different randomly-selected key used only for
that message; even if you discover the key, it isn't used in previous or
future messages so the compromise is limited.
A 1GB message gives about 2^27 8-byte texts, and if you have that much
known plaintext, you probably don't need to decrypt the rest :-)

On the other hand, if someone had a known-or-chosen plaintext attack on
a public-key algorithm, that would be interesting, since you can
generate as much chosen plaintext as you want.

Crypto usually cares more about integer MIPS than MFLOPS.
I'm not up on current HP models, but 12 HP machines should cost between
$100K and $1M, which makes this attack close to
the second-best attacks on DES, which will break a key in a day for
~$30-50M - Peter Wayner's design used Content Addressable Memory, and
somebody from DEC designed and I think built a Gallium Arsenide DES chip.
The best is Michael Wiener's design using CMOS gate arrays, which
should be able to break a key in about 3-4 hours for $1M.
Doing this well with general-purpose hardware is impressive.

But, yes, this means your PC will still take a while to crack DES;
on the other hand, the NSA has probably been building massively parallel
DES-crackers for a few years, and is more likely to try to break
secure email than most amateurs. :-)
