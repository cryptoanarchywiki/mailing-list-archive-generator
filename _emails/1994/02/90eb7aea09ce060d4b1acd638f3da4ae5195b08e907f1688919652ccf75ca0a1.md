I don't recall whether it was Eric (Hughes) or me that specifically
came up with this....we were riffing on various screwy ideas and this
one popped up. The biggest concern is that the "ideal" name would be
"alt.w.a.s.t.e." except that the period at the end violates the naming
conventions.

In any case, various "pool" groups exist, such as the *.test groups
(as mentioned by others recently), flame groups, etc. I used
"alt.fan.david-sternlight" and "alt.sternlight" for my "BlackNet"
experiment some months back, though the only encrypted messages sent
to BlackNet, that I saw, were posted on Cypherpunks. (In general,
_not_ a good idea.)

Speaking of Pynchon, an amazing piece of news!, My non-W.A.S.T.E
mailbox contained a message today revealing the actual location, in
Aptos no less, of Thomas Pynchon.

Yes, you read this right. Pynchon, not photographed since his high
school yearbook photo 40 years ago, a total cipher, has been living
not more than a few miles from me all these years. 

It seems that in the early morning hours of January 28, 1990, someone
accessed the Department of Motor Vehicles computer files and got a
printout of the elusive man's home address, personal characteristics,
etc. A copy of this was forwarded to someone who studies Pynchon, and
thence to me, for reasons I won't go into right now.

The implications for Cypherpunks, privacy, and Pynchon as roadkill on
the digital highway are clear.

(For those of you who have no idea what I am talking about, or why
this is so significant, ignore this. For those of you who appreciate
the import of this event, I will have the document with me at the
Cypherpunks meeting on Saturday!)
