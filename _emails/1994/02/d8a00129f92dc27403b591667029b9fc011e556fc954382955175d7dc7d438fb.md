	 SS7 uses out-of-band signalling.  The clipper LEAF is an in-band
	 signal.  Therefore a tap for clipper yields two kinds of information,
	 content and identities.

	 Tapping an SS7 signalling network is more expensive and more difficult
	 to justify.  More expensive because it runs packet-switched, more
	 difficult because it's not the conversation of any particular party
	 except the phone company.

Also, it probably goes via a different physical path.  And at least some
SS7 trunks are encrypted with DES.
