We are slightly behind schedule... I've been swamped by work and 
everything else. The shirts will be screened starting this week, and 
should be done by next week. I'll keep everyone updated.

Thanks to everyone who ordered. This project has been a lot of fun to put 
together, and despite the few mishaps, has gone almost flawlessly (aside 
from being behind schedule!).
