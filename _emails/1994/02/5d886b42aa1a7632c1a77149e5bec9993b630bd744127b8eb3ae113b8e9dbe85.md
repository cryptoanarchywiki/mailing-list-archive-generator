I'm having great difficulty extracting meaning from your prose, but I
think you're saying that you like that the government has escrowed
keys to Clipper phones for use in "national emergencies".

We don't have many basements in Austin.

Makes *what* a whole lot easier, building the bomb or catching the

Obviates the reasoning?  I'm confused.

So what exactly are you talking about?  Sounds like you're happy the
government introduced Clipper because it's so easy for anyone to build
secure cryptographic devices.  I'm having trouble understanding this.

Whenever *what* is done?  Whenever somebody builds a nuclear bomb?

I think we should start with, "Be Lucid."
