Get a copy of Schneier's "Applied Crypto" and write it yourself.
Don't expect other people to provide encryption technology for you,
because they probably won't."

You sadly misunderstand. "Us" means US. All of us. Humanity. You also didn't
understand the point of the Dead Kennedy's "Anarchy For Sale." Fortunately
Phil Zimmerman and a few others do, and hopefully they will also give PGP a
"random data block" format output. If we (all of us using PGP on this planet),
don't get PGP off the internet and into the hands of MOST Mac and Windows
users, as well as in hardware form in devices like phones, then as the last
song I quoted said, "You'll (Cypherpunk activists) be the first to go." I
don't code. I make molecules, and soon I will be using standing waves made
by lasers to deposit atoms on surfaces, working at Harvard, Bell Labs, and
NIST to help develop the next next generation of CPUs, sensors and other
devices. If you want something to write code for, 10 years from now, don't
disrespect those who do sciences other than programming.

Your answer is what the government WANTS the programmers to be like, like this:

"You want bulk vitamin C powder which has been rumored to cure that new
AIDS strain that started spreading by air? Well that wouldn't make me or
anyone else any cash, and since the FDA has banned vitamin supplements,
you better go pick up a book on synthesis. I think you start with glucose.
Oh, and include organometallics, since it's only  certain mixed oxidation
state Copper complex dimers that seems to work. Fairly complex stuff. Hurry
up though, I hear that AIDS (Clipper) virus kicks in pretty fast! But don't
expect chemists to give you any, well since you see, that would be altruistic
and that is not logical, since my value system is selfishness. As long as I
can cure myself, and you aren't paying me large sums, well, bye bye."

And making PGP better and posting it anonymously or not, is no where as illegal
as if I were to offer an unapproved medicinal to patients in need, something
that would immediately put me in handcuffs. Happily, drugs that are truly
effective become available to terminal patients, since of course that makes
money. I'm going into crystal and surface chemistry anyway, and the FDA
seems to be failing in its ongoing attempts to take away my legal vitamin C
powder. I fear though that they may succeed in 10 years, and the Clipper's
going to send my e-mail into the FDA's "bad guy" files, as being a person who
takes more vitamin C than can be found in a can of Coca Cola. I just want
privacy and to be left alone. And research funds ;-).
