-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I have released an OS/2 device driver for the CALNET/NEWBRIDGE RNG-810
random number generator.

The file rng-810.zip has been uploaded to ftp-os2.cdrom.com.
It has been placed in the directory /pub/os2/incoming.
I have recommended that this file find its ultimate home
in: /pub/os2/2_x/drivers.

It has also been made available in compu$erve
forum: OS2USER LIB:3 as the file rng810.zip

Sources are included in the file, and its is released
under the GNU Public Licence. It is written in Borland C++ 3.0
and TASM(IDEAL MODE). The Borland C++ runtime source is needed
to compile it.

- - From the software point of view, the RNG-810 is a very simple device.
Simply do a "in" instruction on the port (300h 302h 304h or 306h) depending
on its jumpers and you receive a random byte. The IO driver can probably
be used with any random number generator that is accessed in the same
way.
