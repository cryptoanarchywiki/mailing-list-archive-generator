        Depends on what the required reading list for this group is.
        I thought that our purposes were to promote the privacy of
        individuals through the use of cryptography.  This can be done
        in the contexts I talked about with symmetric as well as PK crypto.

        Maybe I have the wrong idea about "our purposes", please correct me
        if I'm wrong.

        Rumor has it that Kent Marsh is working on an IDEA module for 
        thier products as well.

        You're right its free.  If something is free you can't really complain
        about it.  If it does anything its a bargan.

        I can live with disagreement.  Of course hopefully you would admit
        that Cryptomactics ability to select a file in the finder, pull down
        a menu and Boom encrypted file is easier than PGP's methods.
