Glad to see cpunks back to crypto talk.
 
Anyways, to those of you who are anxious to see crypto applied in a
larger arena, your opportunity might be coming soon.
 
A few months back I announced that I will be starting a Data
Security Corporation which will apply and develop crypto
protocals.  To all those who have been inundating me with questions,
they will be answered very soon.  I have been *very* busy, but the work
is coming along fine.
 
So, if you are interested in getting involved, or if you would no longer
like to be contacted about it, let me know.  A general message will go out
by the end of the week.  Personal replies and requests closely
following.
 
To all those who have already responded I am sorry that it has taken this
long.  I want to do this right.  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  Now lets
make it pay off.
 
Cypherpunks form Corporations!
