I am referring to the minimum bits  coding scheme invented by DAVID HUFFMAN
in 1951.
I would like something that does some concrete examples in radix other than 2
hanks for your help.
I think Huffman is at ucal-santa cruz and would like to know his e-mail address
as well.
He was at MIT back in the fifties and worked with Fano et al on coding theory.
