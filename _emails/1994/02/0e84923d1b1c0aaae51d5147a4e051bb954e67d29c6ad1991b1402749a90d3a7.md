I'm new to this list, but not to the issues discussed.
As far as "the ends justifying the means" - jeez, have'nt we all learned 
*anything* yet? I spent 4 years in the Israeli army witnessing all manner 
of atrocities commited (on both sides) in the name of lofty, noble goals.
The first victim of oppression is always the truth - lets not play into 
their hands. If our anti-Crapper-Chip case is strong enough on it's 
merits (and we all obviously believe it is), then we only weaken 
ourselves by resorting to disinformation. "They" will always lie more 
artfully than we can - it's how they got elected in the first place. it's 
what they do for a living. Have a little more faith in the truth, don't 
sell out.
