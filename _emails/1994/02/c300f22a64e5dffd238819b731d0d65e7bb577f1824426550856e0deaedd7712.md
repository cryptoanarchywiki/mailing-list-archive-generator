 I agree with Tim whole-heartedly on this one. If the NSA gets it's
much desired "Digital Telephony Initiative" passed it will be a
trivial matter both politically and technologicly to intercept and
record all clipper key block transactions. The ability of the NSA
to do this, and the usefullness of this kind of traffic analysis is
left as an exercise for the reader.
