tentacle, you've got the cutest little tentacle
I ate some stamps and now my life's not dull, tentacle
you're an anarchist medusa
I use crypto to confuse ya
tentacle!
your headers bouncing through my sendmail-dot-c-f!
we do not see your puss
'cos you're anon-y-mous
with your little tentacle!

tentacle, you've got the cutest little tentacle
in fact I see you've got your hands quite full, tentacle
as the newsgroups I see you fill
I would hate to get your phone bill
tentacle!
typing on fifteen keyboards, seen in 50 states!
Rick Wakeman envies you!
Wave hi to Elvis too,
with your little tentacle!

feel free to repost to crypto-toads/alt.filk or whatever that is! >;-7
