-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

People have mentioned possible attacks against Magic Money.

I don't think it is possible to send the server a value to sign which
would reveal the server's secret key. The server signs your message x by
raising x to the power d. If you know x^d and x, finding d would seem to be
a discrete-logarithm problem, which is just as intractible as factoring.
Can a small or otherwise rigged x help you to find d? If so, participating
in any blind signature protocol is very dangerous, but I don't think that
you can find d this way.

Magic Money is not susceptible to the first (intercept) attack, because
the coins are encrypted with the server's public key. The reply is also
encrypted with a response key sent to the server inside the encrypted
packet. The server signs its responses, so you couldn't send someone some
bogus coins and then fake the server's response to fool the person into
believing that the coins were good.

Magic Money has no account numbers; the server just exchanges old coins 
for new coins immediately. A version of the second attack is a problem. The
message from the user to the server has no authentication. It is just an
encrypted PGP message to the server. There is an RSA packet and an IDEA
packet, and the data is directly inside the IDEA packet. 

If you were to dearmor the message and garble something near the end, then 
re-armor it, the server would bounce the garbled coins with a bad signature. 
Some of the first coins would already have been cancelled, and their value 
would be lost. To prevent this, the next version will MD5 the data packet 
before encrypting it, and include the MD5 value. This will be checked, and 
if it is bad, the message will be thrown out before processing any of the 
coins. This is not a pressing problem. Who would go to all the trouble to
make a remailer detect and corrupt certain messages? The person doing the
corrupting would not have anything to gain.

A while ago I read of a program in alpha-test called Nautilus. This was
specifically designed to compress speech for modem transmission. The author
said that the beta, when it was ready, would be Copylefted. PGP Tools, if
combined with Nautilus, has everything you need to do a secure phone. With
the Clipper push, we need one badly, and now. It should use PGP keys for
authentication, but either DH or a one-shot RSA key for key exchange. That
way they can't record the session and demand your key later, as they could
if you used your regular PGP key for the key exchange.
