Readers may recall that many years ago, their parents gave them this book 
that had, attached to its pages, all sorts of fastening devices.  The 
Button Book had cardboard pages with shoelaces, zippers, buttons, buckles 
and all sorts of great stuff.  Good training for fastening things.  The 
CPSC felt that the buttons were too easy to remove.  The old "oh no your 
book is dangerous it may kill my (stupid) kid."

The publisher didn't try a 1st Amendment defense.  I don't know if they've 
ever reissued.

DCF

Who survived to adulthood before the CPSC (as difficult as that may be to 
believe).
