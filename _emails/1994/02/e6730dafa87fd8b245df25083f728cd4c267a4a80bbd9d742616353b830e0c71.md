I don't see how you factor out the variables of the resolution, what
physical property is scanned, etc.  For some combinations, it would be easy 
to forge 100% matches.  For others, it would be hard to get a 30% match on
the original object...  Maybe the whole scheme could be improved by a
trap-door function that has built-in error-tolerance.  (By the way, if 
anybody knows about fuzzy hash functions, please write me; I'm curious for
other reasons.)

Isn't Great Art overpriced by thousands of times, in terms of reproduction
cost?  Anyway, a 2/3 rejection rate would be tough.
