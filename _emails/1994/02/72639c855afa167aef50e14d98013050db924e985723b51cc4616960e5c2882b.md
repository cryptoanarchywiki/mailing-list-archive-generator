Then I would humbly suggest that you drop whatever service provider is
ripping you off by charging you for connect time, per-message, etc. and go
with someone like Netcom, who charges a flat fee per month.  Why pay for
Compu$erve?  It's one of the most expensive around. 

I pay to read what's on this list, too - but like Tim May and others, I
got wise a while back and got an account with a service provider who
charges me a flat fee for access.  I would *never* use a service much that
charged me per-hour - there are just too many out there who won't. 

Yes, I, too have a Compuserve account - I use it for about 10 minutes a
month, usually for figuring out airline schedules and surfing Newsgrid.
I've got this nifty expect(1) script gizmo that dials up Compu$erve, sucks
off mail and Newsgrid, then drops the connection.  I pay about $7 a month
or so.  I use Netcom for everything else, and I usually rack up around 4
hours a day on Netcom.  I *still* only pay $18/month.
