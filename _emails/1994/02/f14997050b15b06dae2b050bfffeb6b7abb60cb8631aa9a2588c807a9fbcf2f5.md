PGP Slave,

Could you please announce my full name, phone number, address, visa card
number, a giff of my signature, height, weight and driver's licence number
not only to the Cypherpunks mailing list but to many usenet groups as well,
since you obviously feel I no longer wish to be known to the masses as
Xenon, and I instead want them to start calling me and postal mailing me
asking for copies of PGP. Thanks asshole. I thought the people on this
list were concerned with privacy, but I was wrong. I mention Xenon in
my personal .plan, but I ask people to let me keep the small amount of
extra privacy I still retain.

You wrote,
"qwerty account or not, the public logs on netcom show more than enough
info to trivially track people down."

Trivial? And so you hack out the info that a message went from remailer
A through qwerty and on to remailer B, at a certain time. You haven't
tracked down anyone my friend.

-Xenon
