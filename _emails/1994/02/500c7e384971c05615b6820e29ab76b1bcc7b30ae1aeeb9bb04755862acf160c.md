I work on the Federal Reserve *Board*'s Research Network.  This network
is hidden behind a firewall, and won't even let you finger (much less telnet)
into.

I sent your message to the network administrator, Janice Shack-Marquez
(m1jsm00@frb.gov).  Obtw, Libby Flanagan has fled to the private sector
(lf@nwu.edu) where vendors can now give her coffee cups with filling out
forms.

Janice (quickly) got at least three people looking into the problem.
Bob Drzyzgula (m1rcd00@frb.gov) found a machine that perfectly matched the
problems you described.  Bob contacted them, and they seem to have corrected
the problem.

Don't worry about black hats, though.  If anything gets investigated, it outta be
the district bank.

I *would* like to know the IP address you had connected to to verify that
we're talking about the same machine.  You can use the remailers, and encrypt
to my public key (available on the servers, key ID C744CD).  

All the "cool" secrets (wire transfers and the like) don't get anywhere NEAR
the internet.  The Federal Reserve System has a separate (yes, encrypted)
network for sharing data.  The Federal Reserve Banks are all "private"
companies, and several offer various other services (such as economic
bulletin boards and the like).  The Federal Reserve *Board* has Research
network (where I am) used to prepare statistical releases and act as a data
service for the Chairman & Governors.  The Board does not offer any services
to the internet (we should, but that's a long story).  The point of all this
is that you didn't really find anything very sensitive, although we do
appreciate closing gaping holes like that.
