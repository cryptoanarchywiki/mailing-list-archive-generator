        I wasn't saying that PK wasn't important, or the most important.
        I agree it is a great thing.  I was just saying that I thought
        cypherpunks was also about non-PK crypto.  I also ventured to think
        it wasn't just about PGP, but all crypto used for purposes of
        insuring individual freedom and privacy.

        I read the Wired article.  I've also read the FAQ.  Missed May's
        manifesto is it available via ftp?

        But isn't hiding things from your boss important in the
        cypherpunks worldview, even if people choose not to use
        PGP?

        Seems to me that the fact is many, if not most, people will
        not use PGP because of is outlaw status.  Many of us are attracted
        to it because of that, but many people aren't.  We can still
        advocate methods that people are comforatable with that will
        further our goals.

        If I'm wrong about the very basics of the list, then I guess this
        discussion is good, because I've been around for a couple of months
        at least and this is the idea I got.
