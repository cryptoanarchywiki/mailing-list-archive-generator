The bug was in my code, not in mpilib, but the need to set precision can
be a real pain. I've been plagued by intermittent bugs caused by mpis not
being completely cleared or fully calculated out. Since modexp does it
automatically, I'm just going to set it to max. If you or someone else with
both types of machines wants to fix that, feel free. I don't have the
means to do so, and it's been my experience that writing code you can't
test is a waste of time.

PTD is a kludge. There are no similar dependencies in the library itself.
PTD was just written as needed to test the rest of the library, and was not
intended to be a usable application. You can either put in #ifdefs for your
machine, or set up another module with the needed globals. I just wanted to
code around the need for timezone stuff and get the test code working.

I've got another version of PGP Tools ready which removes most of the
set_precision stuff, and a version of Magic Money which checks the whole
coin when it receives it. There are a few more changes for Magic Money,
but I should be mailing out soon. Someone wrote that they had success with
a big-endian machine - whew! and thanks for testing it.
