For the second week in a row; the Admin, fascism, and computers made the 
front page of the Saturday NYT.

They are going to legislate the Digital Telephony Initiative or the 
kinder, gentler, version thereof.  Telecoms customers will get to pay 
$300+ million to tap themselves.  The Klinton proposal is alleged to be

it's meaningless since virtually all future voice and data services will 
be delivered over "private networks."
