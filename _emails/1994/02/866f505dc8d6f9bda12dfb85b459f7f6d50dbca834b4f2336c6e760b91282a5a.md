False!  If digital coins represent some kind of value the bank will 
"earn" something by not accepting a coin presented for deposit.  The bank 
will not have to provide the value or the service the depositor is 
entitled to.  This was also pointed out by someone else posting to this list.

I haven't studied the maths and protocols of the original post to 
closely, but just to show that it is possible to *prove* double spending 
I present a deposit protocol.  I don't know if this protocol fits in the 
implementation discussed here.

If I remember correctly, some of Chaum's (?) digital coin systems proved 
double spending by using a protocol resembling the one below:
   1)  Depositor presents a part of the coin to the bank and asks "Is 
       this coin already deposited?"
   2)  The bank answers "yes" and proves this by revealing some 
       information about the coin which it should now know unless the 
       coin has already been deposited.  The "no" answer together with 
       the information presented by the depositor is signed by the bank 
       and is a *commitment* by the bank to accept the coin when the 
       "real" deposit takes place.
   3)  The depositor sends the rest of the coin to the bank if the answer 
       was a "no".
This is taken from memory -- I could probably produce some references if 
someone is interested.

By the way -- I don't think you should use the "digicash" word to 
describe this implementation.  David Chaum's company carries that name!
