I was wondering if anyone has an answer to
a question on PGP....

About how many calculations does it take
to crack a 1024 bit key?  If someone
has limitless time, money, etc., they
can break it...but how many calculations
does it take?

Also, there is a password used to protect
the keyrings.  Assuming a strong password
how many calculations does that take to
break?

If there isn't some special method, an
assumption that leads nowhere, just how
much "brute force" effort is really required?

Thanks, Dave
