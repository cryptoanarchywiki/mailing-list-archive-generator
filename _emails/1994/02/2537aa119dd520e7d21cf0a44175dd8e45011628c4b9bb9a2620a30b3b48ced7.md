To keep this type of service from being abused there would need to be some
kind of validation. At the very least the listproc should receive some form
of 'ok' from the user being deleted in absentia. Otherwise the list would
desolve into a morass of people unsubscribing others who annoyed them for no
other reason than agravated neurosis. In general it would do nothing but
double the load, further reducing bandwidth.
