Sorry about the confusion Matt, I had sent a letter to Xenon about his
idea for stripped PGP describing this pure RSA program, and didn't
send it to the list.

Anyway, the program RSA.tar.gz is at ghost.dsi.unimi.it in /pub/crypt.
It implements pure RSA, no IDEA session keys, no MD5 hash of a
passphrase, no checksums, no keyring, no usernames, etc.  It is about
as minimal as you can get.  Which may be perfect for your purposes :-)

Because it is just RSA, it is SLOW!!  Which is to be expected, but all
the same the amount of time required to encrypt a reasonable sized
file is surprising.  Heck, even generating a decent size key takes
quite a bit of time.  I'm sure the code could stand some
optimizations, but even still public key crypto is much slower than
secret key.

Here's what a public key from the program looks like (in fact, it's my
public key for this program):

9124780B096F1C3ADE5

This public key and the associated secret key correspond to about a
700 bit modulus (100 digit and 110 digit primes).  The program encodes
numbers as an ascii string, but that is it.

The output of the program is the encrypted file, which has no header
or magic byte information, etc.  Decryption takes an encrypted file
back to the original form (except it looks like it pads and doesn't
toss the padding, maybe a bug) but if you use the wrong secret key
(i.e. not encrypted for you) the program decrypts the file to junk.
Or you can decrypt junk into different junk :-)  If you edit your keys
and change a few characters, or do the same to the encrypted file, you
don't get "checksum" errors, you just get an unreadable file.

Due to the slowness of the program, I think for testing the output for
randomness one should create relatively small keys (say 20 or 30
digits max) and encrypt large files.  Of course, at these sizes, it is
much easier to factor the modulus than brute force IDEA, for example.
Also, if you want larger keys be wary of the included script which
generates keys for you; it assumes you want a small key (and thus will
mess up the generated files).

So if indeed this is nothing but RSA then it should be impossible to
tell the output of the file from random noise.  (And incidentally, I
checked out Chaitin's Algorithmic Information Theory and have tried to
read the chapter on random numbers, but let's just say that it is
extremely slow reading :) I guess that's because it builds on stuff
from previous chapters or something...)
