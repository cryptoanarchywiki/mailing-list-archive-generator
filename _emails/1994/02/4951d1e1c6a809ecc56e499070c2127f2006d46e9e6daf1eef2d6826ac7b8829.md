This question has come up a couple of times lately, and nobody seems to
be talking.

Does anyone know the budget size and sources for CERT?  Is CERT
'officially' part of the government or do they operate independently?
And could a FOIA request yield results, do you think?

*waves to the CERT guys reading this letter.  They are monitoring this 
group, I have proof!*
