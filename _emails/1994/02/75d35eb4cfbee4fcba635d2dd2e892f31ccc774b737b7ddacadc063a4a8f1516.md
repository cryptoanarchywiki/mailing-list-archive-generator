                          Developed for the World
                            And Applied to Your
                                  Office


Hello All,

  You might be wondering, "Who is this Information Defense
Strategies"?  And, "Why is this in my mailbox"?  And I would say,
"Well, that's a good question".

  About three months ago I announced that a new data security
corporation would be started soon.  Its emphasis would be in the
application of cryptographic protocols already in existence and
the possible development of new ones.  Well, that idea has been
born into IDS.  

  Why have you received this note?  The reasons are varied. 
Either you contacted me with interest in getting involved, or I
have been exposed to your interests in data security through
public exposition of such, or a member of the security community
referred you to me as an entity interested in what we are doing. 
Regardless, you have received this note because you are qualified
in one or many ways to get involved.

  Many of you are already related to some sort of computer
profession right now.  This note is to let you know we are out
there, and are interested in building bridges to your
organization.  Please read through the information provided below
and provide feedback if you can.  

  Many people have been anxious to see this get started, as of
course I have been also.  Finally, a description has been put
together.  Through the next round of feedback, we will be ready
to begin.  It is exciting to be starting out and applying ideas
that have floated around for some time.  This might be one of the
first virtual corporations to have been born as such.  I would
like that sort of cutting edge to remain our vanguard at IDS. 
And I would like all of you to be a part of it.

Applied Cryptography

  No not the book (although I highly recommend it).  IDS will
base most of its robust security strategies upon encryption. 
Being well aware of ITAR we will be careful and yet aggressive in
our application.

  I have targeted two areas for immediate concentration, Smart
Card technology and encrypted challenge/response access systems. 
I am, of course, interested in much research and future
development in other areas.  These two are merely the most
immediate opportunity.

  To remain on the cutting edge, IDS will need to be very active
in Research and Development.  Many people are moving towards
applied cryptography.  It is personally important to me that IDS
be there at the same time if not before others.

Security Services

  We will basically provide four security services. 
Consultation, evaluation, Tiger Teams, and IDS Custom Installs. 
We will consult for firms with a general interest in security as
well as those that are well established in the field.  This
consultation will be general in nature and very affordable.

  IDS will also evaluate a firm's current security status.  This
service will offer our clients the opportunity to have a third
party objectively review their security.  A report of weaknesses
will be generated from our evaluation.  

  IDS may offer clients a Tiger Team ongoing contract.  This will
consist of teams actively attempting to covertly breach security
in order to actively discover and immediately close undiscovered
security holes.  The insurance provisions of this area are
tentative and pending and therefore this aspect of IDS is still
tentative.

  Finally, we will offer IDS Custom Installs.  These will vary
from unique IDS developed Strategies to already developed
strategies.  Our custom security front ends will be constantly
updated and evaluated.  Third party product partnerships will
increase our viability as well as increase the availability of
robust security products.

Platforms

  The data related operating system platforms we will deal with
will attempt to be comprehensive if not exhaustive.  In order to
tap our targeted market we must be diverse.  While I personally
would love a concentration in Unix work, the reality is that many
of our clients will be LAN based machines of the personal
variety.  We will therefore need specialists in lower level
systems (PC, MAC, etc).


Telephony

  Toll fraud can be devastating to smaller businesses.  The days
of "blue boxing" exploration appears to be over in this country. 
Unfortunately, the replacement, at least to a certain extent, is
PBX and VMS abuse.  In fact most people in business have been
told that it is not a matter of if your PBX will be hit, but
rather when.

  In addition Voice Mail Systems (VMS) are being utilized across
the country without authorization.  While some unauthorized users
might mean no harm, there is no way to assure that malicious
abuse does not occur.  Valuable information may be left to the
conscience of the underground community.  Applying cryptography
to this problem will be part of our charge.

  From front ends to challenge/response, there are many
opportunities in this market.  Making this security affordable
will be our answer to this dilemma.

IDS Basic Philosophy

  Data Security is VERY important.  It is no longer just
important to huge corporations, but to everyone.  Affordable
security consulting and products will help make small business
information more secure.  While CERT attempts much, it is slow to
respond and many questions are still unanswered about its funding
and allegiances.  It is time to not only make security available
but accessible.  That is why IDS will exist.

  An incredibly large market is being overlooked by the elite of
security professionals.  IDS will address this void in the
market.  All people deserve good data protection.  We can offer
it.

  The plan is that IDS will actively pursue the myriads of
offices around the nation with data to protect.  From every small
law firm with a voice mail system to an accounting firm with
several LANs to a sales force that needs easy access but is still
concerned with protecting its data, we can offer tailor made
security strategies.  Our profit (future) will be based on
horizontal integration, in other words we will not profit by
selling high price tickets to the few that can afford it but
rather massive application of moderate priced strategies to
everyone we can contact.

  There are a number of other points I will make in future
communications.  I plan on having a virtual office that may offer
digital cash sales in the future.  We may develop a low level net
for our own communications.  Partnerships will need to be
developed as well as some manufacturing research.  But I wanted
to give those interested an introduction.  If you are still
interested I will send you the next update.  Please respond
either way so I know whom to keep on the list.

More details to come....
