I think these two have a lot to do with each other. Sergeys' suggestion 
would definitely make it a tougher to pick out a starting place to 
search for hidden text. However, the message (if it is ever found in the 
file) points to the intended recipient. This defeats the purpose of 
"stealth pgp", (which would probably be used in this case to strip off 
telltale headers and such). 

If you weren't worried about this type of deniability, though, I don't 
see a problem with it.
