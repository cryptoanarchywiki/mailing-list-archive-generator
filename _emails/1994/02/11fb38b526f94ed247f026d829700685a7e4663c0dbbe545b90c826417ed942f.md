  Long ago when I started writing pgpmail, I felt one reason people
weren't using PGP much was inconvineince.  So, I wrote code to fix
this.  Now if you use GNU Emacs to read and author mail (as I do) you
can use my pgpmail (FTP://ftp.markv.com/pub/pgpmail/*) to
automatically encrypt, decrypt, sign, and check the signatures -- all
with little or no effort. (C-c e to encrypt, everything else is 0
interaction, save entering your PGP passphrase.)

  Now admittedly, this only works on systems where GNU Emacs can read
mail and run PGP.  This translates to primairily multiuser unix
machines.  Sigh.  Well, at least you can do as I do, maintain 1 key
for low security multi user systems, and another (high hassel cost)
key for high security.

  The next project I am working on is a 'packet privatizer'.  Expect
alpha release sometime this or next year.
