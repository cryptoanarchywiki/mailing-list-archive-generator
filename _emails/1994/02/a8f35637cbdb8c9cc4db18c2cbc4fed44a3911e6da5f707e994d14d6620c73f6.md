Mike Godwin asks whether one of Clipper's attractive points (well, not

to us, anyway) is the increased ability of LE to do traffic analysis.

Of course! Let's say that you call someone who's under Clipper
surveillance. Of course, you use your Clipperphone(*). The feds can
now go to a judge and say "Well, we know the holder of this key ID
called the suspect we have under surveillance... we want to surveil
_his_ line too." Guilt by association.

The agents should ideally have lawful authorization to be monitoring
the line, but think how easy it would be to do full-time, real-time
traffic analysis based on LEAF information.
