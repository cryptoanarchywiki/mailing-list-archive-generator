 My Real World intrest in crypto is in preserving my freedom of speech and action in the face of a government who continues to try and deny those rights to me.
 As many on the list have said,we cannot always trust the government to uphold the rights granted in the constitution.With crypto,I hope a measure of self-gurantee will come about so we won't have to rely on government trust.Freedom of
speech is a real world thing,we use it everyday.Any crypto product that enhancesthat use and protects it,I would use.In addition,economic freedom is something
I would be intrested in using(as i watch more of my cash go to government).
