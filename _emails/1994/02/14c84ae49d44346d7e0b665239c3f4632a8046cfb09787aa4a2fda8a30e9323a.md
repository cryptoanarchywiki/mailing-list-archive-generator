So? If you find a paper with YOUR face, YOUR name and big 
letters KILL THIS MAN FOR BEING A JEW, would you think
this is okay?

Would you give out PGP for mailing such calls encyphered?

> Do you not have to register your newspaper?

No, we don't. This is not true. Who told you this tale?


Is it "freedom of press" if someone tells american people
that germans would have to register their newspapers?
