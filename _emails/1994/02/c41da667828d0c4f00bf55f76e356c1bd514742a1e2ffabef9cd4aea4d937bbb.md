Dear Master Lefty,

You too, have fallen into the same trap, as Master Knight, i.e.,  ad hominem 
attacks, unprovoked, launched merely because I disagree with you. As to 
your arguments, no I don't think you have followed my logic at all, and I 
certainly cannot follow or agree with your assertions. My point is that 
the redistribution of usenet postings by  Netcom, my local bbs, me on my 
hard disk to others for pay or not, or by cd-rom are not different and it 
is just as legal for Netcom to charge me for providing me a usenet feed 
as it is legal for a cd-rom manufacturer to do the same, neither is 
paying us a dime nor are they obligated to do so. Personal use is not at 
all relevant. Netcom, Delphi are copying and providing usenet newsfeeds 
as a commercial service, without paying any royalties to the authors of 
the usenet postings. And we can all do the same and use any medium we 
want to  whether you or Master Knight like it or understand it.
