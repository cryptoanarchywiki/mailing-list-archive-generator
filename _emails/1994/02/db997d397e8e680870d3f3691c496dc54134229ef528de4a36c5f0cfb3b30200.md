It is interesting to read all the recent posts about Oceania, because it is
of course the story of Sealand, an independent country that was founded in
the Seventies. It would be wise if the promoters and future citizens of
Oceania studied the failure of Sealand before putting another dime into
their  doomed project.
Shortly after Sealand was funded on a large surplus housing platform in the
oil fields of the North sea, Sealand began issuing its own currency,
passports, and stamps. The results were predictable: nobody wanted their
money, no other country accepted their passports for entry, and the
international postal organization refused to deliver their mail. IMHO,
there can be little doubt that Oceania would suffer the same fate-if the
project ever gets a far as having a platform.
The nations of the world are like a very exclusive country club: no new
members accepted. Occasionally, a former member gets readmitted, or one
member dies and her two children take her place, but there will be no
newcomers.
