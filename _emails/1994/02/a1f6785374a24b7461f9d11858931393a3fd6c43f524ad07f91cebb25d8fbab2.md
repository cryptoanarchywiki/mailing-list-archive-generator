Was wandering the net tonight and came across this:
 
ripem.msu.edu /pub/crypt/other
 
 
675558 Jan 27 15:37 miracl-3.23.zip
 
There is a whole lot of source (c and cpp) for various
bits of factoring, rsa, etc, and a few executables but 
most interesting is a program called "Scramble".
 
Has anyone tried this out?
 
I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but it appears to be
a terminal program that uses IDEA encryption to make a 
secure link between two modems.  From the .doc and loop
function it appears to be quite functional.
 
There are many interesting little tid bits in this, 
I'm just wondering why I have never heard of any of it?
 
Drop me a line you know if this stuff is actually secure
or not...
 
Thanx
