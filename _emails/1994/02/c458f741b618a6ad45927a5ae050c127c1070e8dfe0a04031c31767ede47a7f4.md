Why not set up a mailgroup (such as cypherpunks.pgp) wherein ALL
messages are PGP encrypted?  Once one subscribes to the group, she would
receive a message containing both the standard further information about
the group as well as public and PRIVATE PGP for the mail group keys to
add to her PGP key ring.

Then whenever she sent a message to the group remailer
(cypherpunks.pgp@toad.com) it would already be PGP encrypted with the
group key.  And anyone who received that message would be able to open
and read it because they would already have the private key for the
group.

The remailer could check the messages before forwarding them to the list
subscribers to make sure that they are PGP encrypted.  If they aren't
then they wouldn't be sent... a nice side effect of this would be that
the list subscribers would no longer receive those 'unsubscribe user'
messages as most likely these would not have been encrypted before
mailing.
