I cannot see how an 'infomercial' would be effective at all.  The 
audience of people that commonly watch those things are apathetic about 
politics.

Face it, the only way to get the word out is to get the industries of 
power against clipper, then the popular support falls into line.  The 
industries include (but are not limited to):
	Really Rich People
	Really Rich Corporations
	The Media
	Non-US Governments

Coalitions need to be built.

Face it, the government IS NOT going to listen to the people.  The people 
are the ones that the government is violating.  And the commone people 
have no REAL power, and even shorter memories of those violations.

Make the governemtn afraid of those with power, and we can have our way.
