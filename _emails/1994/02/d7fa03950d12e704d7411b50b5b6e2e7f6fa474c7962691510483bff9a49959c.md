Not portable in what ways?  This method of hiding files is valid on many
platforms.

No weird drivers or TSRs are neccessary.  You need rely only on a
commod disk-editor.  The "Bad Guys" will notice nothing out of the ordinary. 
How will virus-checking software notice anything?

They'll notice the stegonagraphy program, though.

Norton UnErase won't help if you leave no traces in the FAT, have no file 
name and especially if you've used a stegonagraphic function to embed
your file in garbage of the sort that is already lying around in the 
deleted portion of the disk, or if you've split your file into many small 
pieces and scattered them around the disk.

Yes fractals are a good place to hide info, as opposed to regular pictures.
If you deem it wise to further hide the fractal file in the deleted 
portion of your disk, you'd gain an even further layer of security.

Absolutely, that's what was noted in the discussion section of the
