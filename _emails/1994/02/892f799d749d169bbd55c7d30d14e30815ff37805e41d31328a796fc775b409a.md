	how do you propose us here onthe east coast hook up?  I
	would think a virtual meeting would be nice, but dont
	know any of the logistics which such an operation.  I
	personally can't travel, and a the best could uh, make a
	long distance telephone call with my neato boxes.  Is
	there anyone in the Deleware area?  Kinda near D.C. and
	cambridge, but traveling to either of those places would
	be difficult, as in near impossible, unless........
