It is true that there was a great deal of enmity between RSA's
president, Jim Bidzos, and Phil but that was just starting to thaw a
year or so ago when I let Jim know that Phil was interested in
licensing RSA's patents (for those that haven't bothered to check,
RSA's fees are incredibly reasonable) because there were some
businesses interested in using PGP that wouldn't because of its
geurillaware status.  I believe that they worked something out or Phil
would not have been pursuing the commercial work he got busted/hassled
for by the fed.  I don't think that RSA deserves any suspicion with
regard to Phil's troubles.

Yes, I was told by a patent attorney that the way we use PGP is
not within the experimental guideline and we are probably standing
in violation of these patents.  Not that that means much, RSA 
is not about to joust windmills by trying to mess with anybody.

A whole lot of precedent for this.  It is in effect one way that the
federal government helps support research without direct taxation.
I read recently that Stanford rakes in an obscene amount each year
from the patents it holds but I really have no problem with that
since it benefits education as a whole.

That's funny, in a weak moment *he* told me that a year ago.  :-)


Peace,
