I did some calculations on this a few months ago, and it works out to
be on the order of 4.42 10^29 steps.  So then you can figure out how
much real time it takes given machine speed.

I also made some calculations for other sizes - to get the rest of the
article gopher to chaos.bsu.edu and look at Misc/"Bits and Factoring
Difficulty" where I have been archiving various cypherpunks posts,
apparently flying the face of copyright laws blah blah blah blah.

Since I wrote that I give permission for it to be at the gopher site
;)

Well, if it's an 128 bit IDEA password, and brute force is the fastest
way to "break" it, then 2^128 = 3.4 10^38.
