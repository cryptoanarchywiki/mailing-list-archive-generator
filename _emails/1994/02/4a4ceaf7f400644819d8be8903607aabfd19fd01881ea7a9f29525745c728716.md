  If the machines to which you want to connect are in a kerberos realm
and you can run TCP/IP (ala PPP or SLIP) on your end, then kerberized
telnet will offer you the ability to

	a) connect to a host without sending your password over the
        connection using a standard kerberos ticket-granting ticket.

	b) encrypt the connection (DES using the session key), so that
	you can, among other things, klog on the remote host without
	the password being sent in the clear.

It should be possible to add other encryption options into ktelnet.

  One might be able to adapt this for BBS use either by modifying
kerberos or by using something like s/key. There's no need for
cleartext passwords to be flying across the wire.
