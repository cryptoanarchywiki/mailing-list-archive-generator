This seems like a textbook example of an ideal use of a remailer.
What makes you hesitant to use that method?  As you say, it's unlikely
that the government would go to the extensive trouble of trying to
bust you if you go through penet.  The worst that could happen would
be that they'd ignore the blowing whistle, but that'd be their
problem.

Note that there may be some way that they could figure out where you
telnetted in from once you alert them to the security hole.
