Well, since someone seems to be home now at Minneapolis, if you wanted
to send something back to that list, I suppose it would be OK. If you
happened to mention in such a missive that the technical contact here

machine or network involved, did not fuck up, and was not amused, the
technical contact would probably not mind.
