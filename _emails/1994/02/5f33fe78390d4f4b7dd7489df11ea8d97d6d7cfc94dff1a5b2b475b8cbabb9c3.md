They have a rather complete constitution, legal system, etc. Monetary
systems would likely appear as needed. Most businesses would likely
take all major currencies - good market for a bank to get into.

Business relations with the rest of the world? This isn't in general
specified in advance in any country, and why should it be? The only
real rule I've seen is making it illegal (for good reason) to export
drugs (eg. recreational drugs, synthesized for use on the island)
to countries where they are illegal.

Besides, since they moeny is far more important on this project than
vague untested notions of how everything should work (hey isn't
that how communist countries are set up?) in advance, they have
been doing quite well. I wish them all the luck I can spare, and
plan to pick up a t-shirt (if only for being able to tell people
about it in 100 years or so...) or a flag...

How much government intervention do you see in your day to day
affairs? Personally, I see virtually nil... Free-market's tend
to sort themselves out quite nicely...
