  I think that we are trying to protect against 3rd parties.  With the
  X-A-R-P:/X-A-S-P: scheme I posted, each remailer *could* log who it
  came from and who it was going to -- it's optional.  But, (with the
  appropriate delays and padding to prevent traffic analysis), a third
  party would not be able to figure that out.

  I would argue that you are correct.  Anonymous remailing is a new service.
  It should have new servers that run on a well-known port (so that any user
  can start one up) and hacks could be put into most of the current mail
  agents to support using an anoymous remailer.  We don't even have to follow
  RFC 822 in the format of our messages, though I think we should.

  Yes.  The easiest way to build a reputation is to assign some unique
  public/private key pair to each anonymous user and require all remailed
  messages to be signed.  Then, you as a user can choose to ignore or
  read messages from that id.  Additionally, it does allow for the
  server daemon to reject postings from "abusive" ids or simply not forward
  the posting, but rather a notice stating the ID and subject line of the
  message, making it available in a public place like anonymous ftp or
  gopherspace for those who *do* want to read it.  

  The really nice thing about this is that it won't prevent people from
  having their anonymity, but it will cut down on the actual damage that
  abusers can do.

  I agree.  I think anonymous remailing should be as close to universal as
  possible.  If there *is* a way to service everyone, I think we should do
  it.  Resorting to non-service of "abusers" should be the last resort.
