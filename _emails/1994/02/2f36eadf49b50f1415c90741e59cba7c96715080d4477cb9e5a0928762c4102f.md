True.  I think it depends on what your intended purpose is for using a
remailer.  If you just want to post an anonymous message, faster would
be better for sake of keeping with the conversation.  If you really want
to communicate securely, you can use remailers such as
elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu which batches messages out at midnite and adds
random padding, or remail@extropia.wimsey.com which offers encryption
and adds a random delay.
