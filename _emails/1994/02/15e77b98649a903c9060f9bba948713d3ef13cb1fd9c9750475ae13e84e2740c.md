All they said on the subject was that the government would be on the
gold standard and everyone else could use whatever currency they wanted.

As for the other little problems, I'd guess they haven't got a clue. 
However, they did hire an architect who is experienced in building
floating structures, so I guess he's considered those things, ya know
like fresh water and electricity.  You could drop them an email and
ask...
