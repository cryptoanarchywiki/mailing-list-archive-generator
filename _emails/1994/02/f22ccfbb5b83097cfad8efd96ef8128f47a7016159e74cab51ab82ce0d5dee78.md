"It took the Colonists several decades to get worked up enough to fight
a war.  We're only halfway through an equivalent time period.
And I don't want to change the situation only with crypto, but also
with public speech."

Would you elaborate?  Earlier, Tim May said something about using "the 
active spreading of
disinformation about the compromise of the key escrow system" as part 
of the attempt to "Actively Sabotage Clipper and Capstone" (title of 
his message).

What sort of public speeches would you (or others) make (to whom)?
(Just curious)
