Thank you for finding this one. That was not a big-endian problem, that
was simple stupidity on my part. When I added the coinid field to the
protocoin structure, I forgot to move the free(pc); down to the next line.
So the coinid was getting freed and then written. Version E is on its way
to csn.org. By the way MPJ, did you get pgptl10b?
