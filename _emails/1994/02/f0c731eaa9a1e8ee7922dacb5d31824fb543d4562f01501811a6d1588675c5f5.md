I found part of a paper on DES VS Skipjack using gopher but could not
find the remainder.  Does anyone know where I can ftp this document 
from or have any other information about this subject.

PS:  Skipjack in the form of Clipper is expected to become a FIPS.
     DES was given a 5 year extention of it's FIPS status then it
     dies leaving only....
