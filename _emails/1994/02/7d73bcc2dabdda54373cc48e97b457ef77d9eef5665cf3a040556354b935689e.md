I'd say having a TSR "hideit.com" loaded into high memory (installed size:
xxxx bytes) watching INT (whatever) would be a pretty good clues that
someone trying to determine that you were using a program to protect areas
of your disk would look for. Perhaps you could try and hide this, too; in 
any case, you address TSRs later...

uh, I don't have one. Do you?

I'm NOT talking about how to recover areas of your disk (you could use 
something like Norton Utilities to pull the noise file off the disk). 
What I'm trying to understand is how you plan to keep that area of your 
disk off limits. 

Like it or not, programs and OSs (if you can call Windows an OS) write to 
disk. Lots. Everywhere. How do you keep it from fragmenting the disk 
immediately and overwriting the space (whose address you have written 
down on that sheet of paper next to your computer?)

Try running windows with a temp swapfile. Run photoshop for windows (it 
writes its' own tempfile on the drive). Save a file from Word for Windows 
and try and control where it goes.


I'm not saying these problems can't be solved; I _am_ saying that what 
has been proposed thus far doesn't adequately address this (if you're 
looking at this as a genuine way to hide your data).

No, no. We _need_ to protect the noise area. 

how? change the FAT? TSR? My example above was an attempt to try and
understand what a TSR you might build would have to ask, every single time
a regular write to disk was performed. (to protect your deleted noise
file).

Ah, a floppy? this makes 10 times more sense. With a floppy you wouldn't 
have haphazard writes to disk (as you do with your harddrive).

sure. two choices:

1) We must protect our noise data.
	Keep it in a location on disk, keep a TSR in memory to protect
that area from writes. 

2) We don't protect our noise data. 
	Keep our data in a location on disk, keep the spots on paper, and 
hope that by the time we need to retreive it, the data hasn't been 
written over. 

I sure wouldn't want to count on 2), and it seems as if 1) defeats the 
purpose.

not bad. One thing to consider: we've moved all of our data to the end of 
the disk, anyway; we'd still have most of our important data at the end 
of the disk, which still might look conspicuous statistically.

not bad. Takes (8 times?) more space, but should work.


Do you understand my objection to keeping track of the files' location by 
hand? It isn't that keeping track of the location/length of the file is 
hard, or retreiving it is tough; the problem is keeping the OS, etc from 
overwriting it in the meantime.
