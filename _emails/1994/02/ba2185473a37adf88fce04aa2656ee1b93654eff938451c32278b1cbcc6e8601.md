Diffie, Wiener et al in "Authentication and Authenticated Key Exchanges"
(Designs, Codes and Cryptography, 2, 1992) discuss the need to combine key 
exchange and authentication, amongst other things. Anyway, the upshot is 
that a Station To Station protocol is developed and discussed which is 
based on the original D-H system. Damn, I don't have the paper which me,
so I'm not sure whether third party certification is needed.

The accompanying discussion, relating to secure protocol requirements and 
so on struck me as quite good at the time IMHO.
