The hidden message need may be a stripped PGP encrypted file.  It need not
specify who its addressed to!  The intended recipient will be able to 
retrieve the file regardless.  His program should automatically revive 
the file starting from _his_ public-key checksum-value offset (which both 
the sender and the reciever already know, without the need for any 
telltale headers in the file).  Even if the opponent tries all possible 
offsets and filelengths he/she will always get noise, never anything 
pointing to the reciever.
