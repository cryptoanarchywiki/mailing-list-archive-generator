There's a jerk that's been mail-bombing me, and I can't do anything
because he's root at his site.  Would it be ethical to use a remailer to 
bomb him back?

Or maybe I shoudl simply fakemail a message to 
alt.fan.rush-limbaugh@anon.penet.fi with his name and have the contents 
say something like 'Limbaugh sucks', or post to alt.sex.wanted with the 
subject 'SWF virgin seeks man for first time'.

Any ideas on how to get someone back, or at least make life annoying?
