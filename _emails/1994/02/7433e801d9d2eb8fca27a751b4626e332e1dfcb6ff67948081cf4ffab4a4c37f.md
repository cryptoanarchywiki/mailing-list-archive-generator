    I got this recently, but hesitated to post, after previously
    being told by folks on the hardware list "thats too much".
    Perhaps not, compared to the RNG-810 that Paul Elliot spoke of.

> How the RNG works
> The Random Number Generator consists of two independent analogue 
> Zener diode based noise sources. Both signals are converted into random bit 
> streams, combined and subsequently transmitted in the form of bytes to the 
> RS-232 port of your computer. Special timing circuits ensure that crucial 
> logical operations occur at  moments that the device has stable signals.
> The baud rate is 9600. So the device is capable of supplying you with about 
> 960 random bytes or 7600 random bits per second
> Power is drawn from the RTS and TXD signal. (pins 4 and 2 of the D-25 
> connector). In order to work properly the RTS signal should be high (5 volts 
> or higher) and one should not send bytes to the device!
> 
> WARNING: part of the RNG is shielded. It is not recommend to open the 
> device. It is not allowed to copy or use the design of the RNG without 
> written permission of the developer, the Foundation for Fundamental 
> Research on Man and Matter (FREMM).
> 
> The testdata
> Each RNG passes a 256 run randomness test before being shipped. Each run 
> consists of 8192 samples. The unselected results of this test are included 
> with the package. If at the end of the test runs the cumulative first order 
> deviation is larger than 1.5 standard deviations the RNG is tested another 20 
> times. If it is accepted after these 20 tests this will be indicated.
> 
> How to connect the RNG to the computer
> The RNG is functionally similar to a 'crazy' modem producing random 
> information to your machine. It should be connected like any modem. In 
> some cases when the computer has a standard D-25 male connector you can 
> plug the RNG directly into that connector. In other cases (e.g.. for Apple 
> machines) you have to connect the RNG through a standard modem cable.

> The program RTEST  (for listing see appendix) takes two arguments.

> RTEST <port> <ncycles>

> <port> indicates which serial port is used (either 1 or 2. (default:2)).
> <ncycles> gives the number of test runs. One test run consists of reading 
> 26500 bytes and calculating the Chi-2 and the number of bits on each one of 
> the eight positions within the byte. If more test runs are specified the 
> numbers (except the chi-2) accumulate.
> If the program is started it will display one sample from the specified port. 
> More samples can be displayed by hitting the ENTER-key.
> Continuous sampling of the test runs is started by the ESC key. The results 
> will be available for further statistical analysis in the textfile 'TEST'.
> 
> The program RAND3 takes one argument.

> RAND3 <port>
> 
> This program starts in the same way as RTEST by displaying individual 
> samples after each time the ENTER key is hit. . After hitting the ESC key 
> continuous sampling starts and the bytes are displayed tin a graphical form 
> in real time. The continuous samples can be restarted by hitting the space-
> bar. Exit through the ESC key.

> The software addresses the serial port directly. It is also possible to 
> implement a driver which is interrupt driven (like the software supplied for 
> the Mac).  A driver is available upon request and can also be obtained 
> electronically from the FTPsite:
> PSI_LINE.psy.uva.nl
> in directory  GUESTS/RNG/SOFTWARE/DOS
> In the near future this site will also offer PK-test programs.
> 
> Macintosh
> 
> The Macintosh software is based upon the standard serial port drivers rather 
> than on direct access of the serial ports. The bufferspace for this driver 
> should be large enough to hold incoming bytes while the driver is active and 
> no reading occurs. In cases where this is not clear one should close the 
> driver and reopen it when needed.
> In the examples the modem-port is used. In the listings it is indicated how to 
> use the printer-port. 
> 
> RNG_test
> The program rng_test will  ask for the number of test runs to perform. Each 
> test run consists of 8192 samples. The chi-2 (df=255) and the number of '1' 
> bits minus the number of '0' bits on each of the positions within the byte are 
> displayed after each run. Chance expectation is of course 0. When more runs 
> are specified the cumulative number of '1' bits  minus the cumulative 
> number of '0' bits are displayed as well as the  corresponding standard 
> deviation.
> All data are saved in the file RNGTESTDATA. Each run on a separate line 
> and the data separated by spaces.
