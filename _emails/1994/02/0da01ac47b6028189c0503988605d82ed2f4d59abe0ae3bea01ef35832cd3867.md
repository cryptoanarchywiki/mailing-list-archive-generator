Is it really a good idea to make anonymous remailers work so fast?
Everyone who can analyze the traffic of anonymous remailers and
can read the from/to header lines, the message size and the 
transfer dates immediately knows who sent mail to whom. 

The make the remailers more safe, I would suggest to modify the
software:

Every message must be sliced into pieces of standardized size
( e.g. 8K or 500 lines ). It should be possible to send the
pieces over different channels. Every server should collect 
pieces and keep them a random time. Perhaps they could be
collected until 10MByte of pieces are collected and then they
can be sent out all. Every piece could contain a time limit
which may not be exceeded by the servers. Higher limit means
more confusion for a spy trying to follow this packet. The
packets should be recyphered by every hop. They could have
a random tail who's length is changed by a hop. A traffic
spy could not find out which input and which output packets
correspond.
