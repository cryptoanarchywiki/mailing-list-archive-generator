         Our private lives and personal communications are
         increasingly being monitored and controlled by
         corporate and government agencies. Individual
         freedom of expression will soon mean nothing
         unless we provide ourselves with forums which
         guarantee and safeguard our inallienable civil rights.

          ccnet anonymous is such a place. Here you will find
          freedom to write anything. Here you have anonimity
          to end the fear of being persecuted or prosecuted for
          your thoughts, opinions and ideas. If  we don't oppose
          the unending infringement of our rights they will
          simply not exist in futureure.

         The choice is ours...

                     ccnet's volunteer administrators do not edit messages
                     for content and take no responsibility for any messages
                     posted on-line. Individuals connecting to ccnet do so
                     voluntarily and at their own risk. Parental guidance
                     is advised. ccnet is not responsible for the titles
                     and content of the messages which may be uploaded.
                     ccnet does not edit remove messages for contents. The
                     following guidelines have been established only in order
                     to facilitate the efficient distribution and storage of
                     messages not to interfere with, alter, determine or
                     censor the flow of messaging

                    1.  Messages posted to ccnet must be 18

                    3.  Messages which are over 18 K or
                        attachments which are unencrypted or

                        distribution and removed after posting
