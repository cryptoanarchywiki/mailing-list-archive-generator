Ok, let's try this one more time... Based on Eric's long and mathematical
explanation, which I did not fully understand and was therefore convinced
by, I have changed the program to use full Chaum cash. It takes the 16-byte
random number, takes its MD5, and stores the MD5 in the coin. The coin is
now a triple (id,e,mpi) and the bank never sees id when blind-signing the
coin, thus preserving anonymity.

I sent this new version to csn.org as mgmny10c.zip. I haven't had a chance
to update the manual or the comments in the code, but it does seem to work.
At least, I was able to mint coins and cycle them through the server a few
times, so the basic coin cycle seems to work. Please check it out, on
machines of both endians, and let me know what happens.
