Let me see if I understand your idea correctly.  I am picturing  
something like the following:

There will exist a bunch of remailers that, in addition to forwarding  
mail, will also sell mailboxes.  (I'm combining the remailer with the  
mail spools to add to the mix of messages to and from).  The  
"mailboxes" are actually e-mail addresses referring to a  
pseudo-account on some machine that hosts a remailer/mail spooler.

Bob would purchase a number of mailboxes scattered throughout the  
remailer/mail spooler system.  Bob would give out the address of one  
of these mailboxes to people so they can send "reply" messages to  
him.  Messages addressed to Bob's "public" mailbox would be spooled  
by the remailer hosting that mailbox.

Periodically (perhaps frequently), Bob would send an anonymous  
message (via other remailers) to the remailer hosting his public  
mailbox to command the remailer to send the contents of his mailbox  
to one of his other mailboxes.  The remailer wouldn't necessarily  
know it's sending to another mailbox, it's just sends to an address  
supplied in the command message.

Bob repeats this process to move his messages from his second mailbox  
to his third mailbox, and so on.  Eventually, he moves his messages  
from his Nth mailbox to his "real" address.

Is this approximately what you had in mind?  I left out IP  
redirectors and POP clients because I'm not familiar with them.
