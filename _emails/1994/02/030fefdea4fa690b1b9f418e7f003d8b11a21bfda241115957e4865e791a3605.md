If you run into this, there is a sneaky way to do it if you have a
friend somewhere that doesn't restrict at or crontab and if your system
provides elm and will will honor a .forward file.  Have your friend set
up a crontab that mails you a short note with some header
characteristic that the filter program for elm can recognize via the
filter-rules file and kick off an invocation of whatever you want to do
each time it recieves one of these notes.  Sneaky but it works.  :-)
