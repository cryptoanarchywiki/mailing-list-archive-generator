This is what I do.  I connect to the net through SLIP and then use Eudora to
retrieve my mail from a DECstation.  PGP is secure that way.  However, the
password to attach to the POP server goes out in plaintext, and was undoubtedly
compromised in the packet-sniffing incident we heard so much about.

I have been trying to look into alternatives to plaintext passords flying
around, but have only confused myself.  What is available?
