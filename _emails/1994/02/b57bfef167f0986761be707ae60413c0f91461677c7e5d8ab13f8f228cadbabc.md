To all my friends (and enemies) out there:

I have purchased myself a netcom account, so that I don't have
to worry about what the university thinks about my political
ideas and about my outspoken nature on privacy, etc.

My new address is  nates@netcom.com  (rather a clever login,
don't you think?)  All mail not pertaining to my office
work at teh visualization lab should be sent there.  My other 
addresses (nate@vis.colostate.edu, nate@lamar.colostate.edu,
nate@yuma.acns.colostate.edu, sammons@cs.colostate.edu and
ns111310@longs.lance.colostate.edu) should still be used for
mail relating ot the Lab and my work there.

Thanks, and have fun!
