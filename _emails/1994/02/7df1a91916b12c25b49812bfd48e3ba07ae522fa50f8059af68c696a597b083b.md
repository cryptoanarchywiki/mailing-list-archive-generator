Ah, and what better way to get qwerty placed in all the other remailer's
kill files? A remailer not part of a network isn't a happy remailer. I'm
already too close to being labeled as some sort of renegade idiot to pull this
anytime soon. The remailer police will pounce on me for this one, when I
change my mind. It would be a lot funner than the level of "punk" I see out
here.

However, I think the real solution is moderated remailers. Then I'd have
and excuse to charge $1 (yes, cheaper than the others :-) ) a pop, and it
would add batching, which could be done in random order. However, sadly,
I personally don't have the time to maintain such a system :-( . Ah, but I
could hire someone to do it for me $-) !

Encryption would keep people's mail private, and Usenet is already public,
and my bad memory would not constitute a "log" of who is getting e-mail.
The remailer script could EVEN be set up to avoid my even seeing the
addresses involved, were they private e-mail.
