I was wondering if I could get on your E-Mailing list.  I have an
interest in data encryption, especially if this clipper chip stuff
really happens.  If you could let me know if you all send newsletters
on a regular basis, if I could be included if it is not to much of a
problem.  Thanks.  My address is W.SLOAN@GENIE.GEIS.COM.
