        I find this to be a strange statement.  Do we have no interest
        in non-public key methods?  Seems the Cypherpunks should have
        an interest in all forms of crypto.  Most users don't currently
        use public key becuase they just want to keep thier boss from
        sitting down at thier computer and reading the resumes they wrote
        for other companies.  This can be accomplished with symetrical
        crypto just as well, if not faster than PGP.

        Cryptomatic does come with Triple DES which is still a very
        strong method.

        Unfortunatly MacPGP's biggest draw back is that its interface
        is poor and it is hard to use.  There is also MacRIPEM which is
        written by Raymond Lau, author of Stuffit, and is much easier to
        use, but weaker than PGP (but legal).

        Can't stop without mentioning that my company make a product
        called Citadel which does DES encryption.
