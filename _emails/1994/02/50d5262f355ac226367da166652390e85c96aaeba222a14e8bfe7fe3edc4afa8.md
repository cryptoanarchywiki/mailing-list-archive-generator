Fellow cypherpunks,

Hm... I'm falling further behind list mail; the day after the security
situation at Rice was fixed (~2 weeks off internet) the hard disk
crashed.

* About remailer policies:

Try to gopher site (chaos.bsu.edu) in "Anonymous Mail"/"Remailer
Policies" I can only really describe what goes on at elee7h5@rosebud,
elee6ue@rosebud, and elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu.

* About tearlines:

There is no standard I'm aware of, although a quick and dirty trick is
to place a single period in the first column.  Most remailers pipe to
/usr/lib/sendmail (and not "/usr/lib/sendmail -oi") so a single period
will end a mail message.  Try it before you rely on it to strip the
rest of your message.  I beleive Miron Cuperman (extropia remailer)
invokes sendmail with -oi.

* About old discontinued remailers:

I remember another discontinued remailer ?@cs.buffalo.edu.  I don't
remember the name, but the student was forced to shut it down because
the university said that running an anonymous remailer basically made
computing resources available to non-students.

* About the remailers I started/run:

elee9sf@menudo also accepts RIPEM encryption
elee6ue@rosebud requires "digital cash" (basically random strings I made)

Errors on elee9sf@menudo are forwarded klbarrus@owlnet.rice.edu where
they are deleted.  I still get mail at that address which is why I
have it forwarded and not just dropped.

Errors on rosebud are dropped
