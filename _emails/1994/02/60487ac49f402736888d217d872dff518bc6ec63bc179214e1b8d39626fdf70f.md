Has this law ever been challenged in court? I doubt if it would stand up,
as long as the books are written as "here's how one would..." rather than
actively encouraging you to do it. Technical information cannot be banned,
as long as you aren't inciting violence.

In any case, here's a good use for the nets and anonymity. Scan those
books, OCR the text, keep the graphics, and put them up for ftp or setup
an anonymous mail server to mail them out. Technology can make such
censorship impossible, but only if we use it.
