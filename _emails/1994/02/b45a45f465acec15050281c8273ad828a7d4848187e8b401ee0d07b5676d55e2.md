Is it necessarily the bank's job to worry about this?   Suppose the bank
simply honors the first request from "anyone" to re-mint a coin; after that
the bank only knows about the new coin.  If Jack pays Jill with already-spent
money, Jill's attempt to deposit or re-mint the coin will fail, and it's
Jill's responsibility to find another way to collect the money.  So if
she's smart, she'll make sure she can re-mint the money _before_ closing
the deal.  It's much like checks or credit cards work today: a transaction
is not considered "complete" until it "clears".
