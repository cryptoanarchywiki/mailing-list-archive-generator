Yes, but it needs to say "byte pgp_randombyte(void);" instead of
just "byte pgp_randombyte();".

No - it is fine.  This is simply a list of what it takes to
eliminate all warnings from Borland.  It is certainly ok not
to do this.  Even PGP generates quite a few warnings while
compiling.

Yes - I didn't notice all the various knobs and dials in
PLATFORM.H until after I wrote that message.  I needed to
define a few more things.

I am running on a 33 mhz 486.  While MPILIB does indeed take
seconds to perform the required arithmetic, it builds its
operations from an O(N^2) multiply algorithm.  A "fast"
algorithm would speed things up considerably.

Just exiting with an error message would be fine.

You are welcome.  I'm not sure I have actually set up a
server aside from the purpose of exercising the code for a
few days.  Hopefully others will grab the executables and do
something a bit more permanent.
