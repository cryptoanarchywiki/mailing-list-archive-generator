Maybe I have just missed something in this whole discussion, so please hold
back the flames, but has a SIMPLE desktop mailer that encrypts using PGP been
writen and widely distributed on any platform ?

The common person will only do something if you make it simple for them to
access.  The attitude of don't complain, write the code youself won't fly
with average Joe who wants to help by spreading the use of PGP.  Most people
have barely just enough time to worry about reading the news and checking
their mail, let alone downlaod, compile and implement an encryption scheme.
The priority should be to get people encrypting first, then worry about
whether they understand the protocol for double-blind remailers.

It seems to me that Universities should be the highest priority for
spreading the use of PGP.  It is the students who are willing to adapt to
new technology the quickest.  Some sort of product should be developed that
can be distributed on the PC and Mac, like Pegasus mail (for those that are
familiar with it), that will support PGP.

It all comes down to marketing.  Why not make a nice free-ware game that can
carry a Cypher bill-board with it ?  How many people see the Maelstrom start
up screen on a Mac ? X-tetris on Unix ?  Minesweeper on Dos ?  It seems to
me that widespread advertising should be a higher priority if PGP is going
to succede.
