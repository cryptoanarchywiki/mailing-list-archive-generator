In response to the posting about setting up a pornography server (Sorry, 
I'm afraid I deleted the specific message so I cannot remember who you 
was :-).

That is certainly a way for people to get and use PGP and to get used the 
remailers.  It would get a lot of heavy use as well.  Now, if there was a 
way to batch mailings (so that if, say, six people ordered one item, it 
would be sent as one letter to all six instead of six different letters, 
with precedence set to bulk), that would help even more.

Now, there are also some practical considerations as well.  What 
materials do you archive?  If you put up pictures (gif or jpeg), you will 
be talking about tremendous amounts of traffic.  Once they are uuencoded, 
even with compression, they can be huge.  If you limit yourself to things 
such as stories and the like, you will have less traffic, but also less 
use.

There is also the legal side of distributing pornography.   Interstate 
transfer is naughty and with Al Gore's Information-Superhighway Patrol, 
it will raise some very political issues (but, by using a decent blind 
system, for all the patrol knows, the distributor might be in the 
recipient's state).

Also, and this is really just an interface issue, scripts should be 
developed that will automate the retrieval process (ie, build and submit 
the mail message).  These would be similiar to the hop.mail or anon.mail 
scripts, but would be custom to the pornography server.

For example:
	It begins with an input for the file to be retrieved.
	It will continue prompting for that until the person enters a
		null (or 'q' or something)
	It will then list (at least) one dozen remailers, and they can 
		select one (or take a default, and randomize it.  Or perhaps 
		randomize it through >1 remailer, although that decreases 
		response time.).
	They will then have to PGP sign their mail message (so that the 
		ordering software can verify the person placing the order. 
  		This is to cut down mail-spoofing to mail-bomb an enemy 
		with porn.)
	Encrypt it for the appropriate parties
	Send it on its way.

The server can either reply immediately with the appropriate files, or it 
can batch everything up for processing during low-traffic times (I 
personally like the first, but dont' really care that much).  The mail is 
then PGP encrypted back to the recipient (by getting the key from a key 
server, or by having the orderee register their key before hand, with the 
latter probably being easier, although it does leave a paper trail that 
can be examined) and sent out with precedence set to 'bulk' so that 
other stuff is more important on the mail links.

It should all be fairly accomplishable with a series of perl and sh 
scripts on either end.  The real question is what to offer.

I'll talk more about this from an organizational stand-point if anyone is 
interested.  I'm afriad that I'm really not that good a programmer (even 
of simple shells) as my field of expertise is in management and other 
administrative stuff (but obviously not spelling :-)
