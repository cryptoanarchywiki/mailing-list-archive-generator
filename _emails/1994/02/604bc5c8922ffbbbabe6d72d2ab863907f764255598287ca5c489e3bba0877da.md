I wish I knew how to help you wake up and smell the contradiction here.
In one breath you acknowledge that government is an enemy of privacy,
and in the next you encourage acting to endorse and empower that very
government by petitioning it.

Secede now!  Then your works need not be exported from US because they
wouldn't be there to begin with!
