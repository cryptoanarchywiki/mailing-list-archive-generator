Cypherpunks,

Bad news on the remailer front... both elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu and
elee6ue@rosebud.ee.uh.edu are gone.  I just found out now, when some
anonymous mail intended for elee6ue@rosebud.ee.uh.edu bounced back to
me (the middle mystery hop of my recent remailer is my account on
owlnet).

I tried fingering both accounts, and it does appear they are gone
(before my old account elee7h5@rosebud was merely locked, so I
couldn't log in but the remailer I set up there kept on running).

The shut down will also unfortunately take out the one at
barrus@tree.egr.uh.edu, since that was just the first stage of a
remailer that worked here and finally sent out through
elee6ue@rosebud.  Mail to barrus@tree.egr.uh.edu was forwarded to my
account here, and I was using the elm filter command to direct that
mail into the remailer scripts for processing.  I can't run a remailer
on owlnet (at least not so obviously, I risked it before since
remailed messages appeared to originate from elee6ue@rosebud on not my
account klbarrus@owlnet) since it is forbidden by the user policy.

So I have three messages (the one bounce, and 2 queued with latency)
waiting to be remailed, but that can't happen anymore since the secret
key for elee6ue@rosebud is gone.  I'll delete them soon since they
can't be decrypted anymore.

I have no idea why this has suddenly happened: I haven't had any
complaints or questions directed to me.  It could be anything from the
grad student who admins rosebud cleaned up old user accounts to
complaints from receipients of anonymous mail.

Anyway, I'll make the changes to the remailer list, and include the
new one at hacktic.nl.
