>> There is a Kerberized Popper available, which uses kerberos tickets

net-dist.mit.edu:pub/pop/popper-1.7k.tar.Z -- as the README-FIRST
says, this is for convenience of people picking up Techmail or
Techmail-S (kerberized pop3 mailreaders, for the mac, the -S version
is for SLIP I'm pretty sure. PC version was just released, I think...)
I've heard rumour of a kerberized Eudora, that would interoperate with
this code, but haven't seen it.

mh-6.8 (and higher) will interoperate with this if you enable KPOP
(and probably ATHENA and one or two other things.) There's also an
emacs-movemail that has KERBEROS ifdef's.

ps. This is all Kerberos 4-based stuff. The popper, movemail, and
pop-from are included in the Cygnus Network Security package (along
with the rest of Kerberos 4 :-)
