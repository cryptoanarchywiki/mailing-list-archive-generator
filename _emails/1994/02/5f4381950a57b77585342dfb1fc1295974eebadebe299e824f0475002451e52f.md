You are asking if I think it is okay, which is different from asking
if it should be legal. I don't think its "okay" to advocate, say,
Naziism. However, I don't see that it should be ILLEGAL to advocate
Naziism. If a newspaper published an article saying that jews should
be killed, I would indeed say that this should be legal. I'm quite
certain that I dislike it.
