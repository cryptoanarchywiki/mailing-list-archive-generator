Gov't Backs Away From "Clipper" Chip

The Clinton administration yesterday backed away from key elements of its
encryption standard in the wake of protests over the use of the so-called
Clipper chip.

Vice President Al Gore said he wanted the holders of the "keys" that would
allow government agencies to eavesdrop on scrambled conversations to
include private companies and the court system.

The Clipper would be used to scramble conversations over phone lines and
computer networks.  In declaring it the standard last week, the federal
government was ensuring that the Clipper will be built into every phone
and computer.

But several civil-liberties groups and some companies objected to the fact
that the chip has a "back door" that would allow law-enforcement agencies
who obtain the proper court warrants to unscramble conversations and
eavesdrop.
