Hey C'punks,

Was everyone too busy arguing about "freedom of the press" to note a real 
act of Cypherpunk stealth?  While some of you were rehashing WWII, 
Cypherpunk co-founder, John Gilmore, was slipping cryptography between 
the lines in a news item about the "information superhighway."  The item 
was about a "new" way to protect against (dare I say it?) 
pseudospoofing. 

Perhaps John will honor us with an official description of Cygnus 
Support's new software.
