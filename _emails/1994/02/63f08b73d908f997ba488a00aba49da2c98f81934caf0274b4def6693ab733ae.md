I'm presently trying to generate a list of prime numbers on
a friend's 486 DX2 66mhz computer, but that is rather slow going
as you might imagine.  I'd like to get a list of all the prime
numbers up to 80 digits in length, and I know these numbers must
have already been computed by someone... atleast for cryptography
purposes.

Does anyone know where I can get such a list, or a portion thereof?

Thanks in advance,
-Garet                  {Garet.Jax@nitelog.com}
