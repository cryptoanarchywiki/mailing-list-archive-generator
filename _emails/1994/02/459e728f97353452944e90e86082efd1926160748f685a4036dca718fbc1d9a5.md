You seem to have a much different notion of "risk" than I do...

Indeed, if national governments were in the business of issuing
digital "notes", then such instruments would be essentially equivalent
to cash.  However, I'm not sure if the mechanism of issuance can be
made the same as that of physical cash; is there a protocol that does
not require a two-way transaction to get the digicash?  (Physical cash
is one way; the money is printed and then essentially just handed out.
It doesn't matter who gets what bill.)

Is storing a $20 US bill in your pocket for indefinite amounts of time
really "risk free"?  How about 20 Chilean pesos?  20 rubles?

(No, digital cash is no better or worse.)
