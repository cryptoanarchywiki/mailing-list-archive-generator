How about this as a way to stump Clipper?

Generate a dialog between you and a friend of no relevant consequence.
Load this sound byte into your system as a AIFC file (sound bite, or byte)
Encrypt data/message/information/recipe/whatever into the low-bits of
the sound bite.
Play message over Clipper-infested line to waiting system.

[ Yes, you could just encrypt a message and send it, but in the above
situation, fleas-on-the-line would not even know data was being transfered
as they listened to Aunt Agnes talk about broccoli casserole.             ]

Just bouncing ideas...
