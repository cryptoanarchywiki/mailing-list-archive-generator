To lefty,

(Skip to end for remailer discussion).

When a control freak has zero to actually say, yet has been infuriated, he
turns to personal attack. If I am infuriating the control freaks, then I am
doing my job admirably.

Which dictionary do you own? I personally own THREE 4 inch thick
dictionaries, all modern. They cost me hundreds. I have a wooden stand to
hold them up. As I am at lab, I do not have them available however and will
have to go to the library....

I'm back.

Censor: A supervisor or inspector especially of morals and conduct. An
official empowered to examine written or printed matter (as manuscripts of
books or plays) in order to forbid publication, circulation, or
representation if it contains anything objectionable. An officer or
official charged with scrutinizing communications to intercept, suppress,
or delete material harmful to his country's or organization's interests.
One who lacking official sanction but acting in society's interests
scrutinizes communications, compositions, and entertainments to discover
anything immoral, profane, seditious, heretical or otherwise offensive.
Examine, cut out, parts of (a book, etc.); act as a censor.

Yes.

>Do you believe that drunk drivers should not be held responsible for their
actions because they don't build their own cars?

No.

This is good advice to anyone interested in maintaining privacy in a public
forum.

Ideal: A conception of something in it's absolute perfection. An honorable
or worthy principle or aim.

First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the
freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

I find it unfortunate that those who wrote the Bill of Rights limited its
scope, to not apply also to industry and other organizations. And it is
people who nit-pick the wording of the Constitution and its amendments who
are turning the USA into a repressive state. Burn baby, burn.

>Not nearly as amusing as _I_ find it to see know-nothing children
>attempting to impress the big kids with their general level of
>uninformedness.

Part of the problem with this command-line interface we are using is that
you can't see me, and thus you can't know me, for who I am as a person.
Flaming one another isn't what we need. If you feel someone misunderstands
something that you understand better, educate them. But realize that most
cases of one person becoming infuriated at another stem from
misunderstanding, a failure to communicate. So tell my why I should censor
Larry 'cause I don't see why I should. It's a lost cause. He will simply
aquire other accounts, or telnet to port 25 of a remailer and fake his
address, but this time with greater ambition to do damage.

The "know-nothing children attempting to impress the big kids with their
general level of (sic) uninformedness" who wrote that Blacknet thing should
think again about getting their thrills out of illegal activity, real or
imagined. You wouldn't have this Detweiler problem if you called yourself
"libertarians" instead of "Cypherpunks". You would increase you level of
support by orders of magnitude as well.

 -----END POINTLESS FLAME BLOCK-----

This following was my response to a discussion in e-mail. I expressed that
I think the MEANS suggested to me to censor Detweiler would so more
harm than good. It was pointed out to me that at least it would make it
less convenient for him to abuse the remailers....

>And that extra work will anger him and fill him with the unfortunate

>means he has to try so much harder to point out to us whatever the hell
>he is trying to point out.
 
>Julf cutting off someone's account isn't effective either for someone

>Again, I wish we could get a net modeled on the postal service, in

>The day someone posts kiddie porn via qwerty is the day I tell Netcom and

And I wrote this, when told that Larry wasn't a responsible
net.citizen, doesn't deserve to be treated as such:

>I agree, but I'm not sure if the means suggested to me are going to
>be effective. He will just aquire other accounts, or telnet to post
>25 of a remailer, to get through, and this time with more passion

>ambition. I don't know the real answer. And are those who wrote that
>Blacknet thing "responsible net.citizens"? If anyone should have been

>And I spoke of the "IDEAL" of the first amendment, which to me means
