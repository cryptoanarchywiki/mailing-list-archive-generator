  I do love to learn, I just wish it didn't have to involve pageing
through many bounce messages.  I have learned that most mailer
programs are unhappy with very long reply-to addresses.  You can rely
on about 200 to 300 chars, no more.  Too bad -- it looks like the real
easy hack won't work for too many hops.  It should work through two
remailers each with 512 bit keys, or one with 1024 bit key.

  One reply I got mentioned that author's previous experiments along
these lines.  (I am not mentioning the author's name so as to keep
their private message private.)  They mentioned trouble with the
reply-to field hack I tried; some mailers wee dropping the nice long
magic numbers.  They said the most reliable field was the subject
field.  I bet many mail agents are unhappy with long subjects too.
Hopefully they support subjects atlease as long as reply-to fields.
