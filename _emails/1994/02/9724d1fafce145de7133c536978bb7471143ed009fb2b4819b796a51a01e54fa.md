Not at the key-escrow phase, no. But you have to have a valid search
warrant or authorization order in hand before you can go to the escrow
agencies and request the partial keys.

Here's the relevant language:

The reason that Reno doesn't just say "a court-ordered wiretap" is
that there are some emergency circumstances under which wiretap
authorization can be gotten in advance of approval by a neutral
magistrate. Both the Wiretap Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act make provisions for such emergencies. 

Eventually, such emergency wiretaps do have to be reviewed by a
magistrate, however. In the Wiretap Act, and, I believe, in FISA, 
the time limit is 48 hours.
