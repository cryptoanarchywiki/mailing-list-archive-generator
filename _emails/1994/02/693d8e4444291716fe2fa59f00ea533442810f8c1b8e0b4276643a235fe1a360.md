Perhaps this is too rudimentary .....

Why not make two shell scripts, one that sleeps for so long (say 20 minutes)
using the unix sleep command, and then calls the remailer scripts in an
infinite while loop.  This would work if you set it up as a background
process,and you don't need to be root for it to work.  Only downsides are
that when the machine crashes you have to log back in and restart script,
your sleep command will always be in the top window if your sys-admin is
watching, and you have to be careful not to spawn to many processes and
bring the system down.
