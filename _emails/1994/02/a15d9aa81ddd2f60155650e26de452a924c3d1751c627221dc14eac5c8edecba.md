People should be aware that whether Niko makes personal logs on his
qwerty account or not, the public logs on netcom show more than enough
info to trivially track people down.

By the way it's very bad practice to forge From: lines, especially
with completely non-existant site names like qwerty.org...perhaps
you should ask netcom to register it for you.  Or if they charge real
money for it, your postmaster at columbia.edu might do it for free if
you asked him nicely.
