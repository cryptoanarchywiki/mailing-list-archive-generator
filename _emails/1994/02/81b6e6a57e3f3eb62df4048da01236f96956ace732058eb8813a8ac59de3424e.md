That's not what he said.  He said 'modem', and as a consumer item that's
far from a 'Rockwell integrated modem module'...  That part is a small
part of the whole price of the modem, which you'd know if you looked
at price sheets.  For a 99 modem (which I see all the time with 14400
fax/data), the modem chip is probably $15-20.  The accepted minimum
markup on a manufactured item is 50% of selling price.

Of course, you can cut the margin if you sell enough of them, and it's
hard to say what the manuf. margin on a $99 modem is.

In anycase, he's talking about a slower modem, effectively, using a
DSP (Zyxels, which beat most modems on features and performance have
always used DSP's: they do data, fax, voice, callerid, touch tone
recognition, etc.  They include a 68K and >512K ram (I think)).

Well, he certainly might not succeed, but it sounds plausible to me.
