-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I have just verified that SecureDrive 1.3A, previously announced
here, is available not only at the following public BBS's as
SECDR13A.ZIP:

  Eagle's Nest         (408)223-9821
  Flying Dutchman      (408)294-3065

But I have now verified that Version 1.3A may now be obtained from a
mailserver.  Send mail to

Server@Star.Hou.TX.US

with body text that looks like this

get /files/public/secdr13a.zip
quit

Please attempt to use the mailserver or the two BBS's above before
requesting a copy directly from me.

Note: Attempts to use either the above BBS's or mail server to
transmit SecureDrive 1.3A (or any strong cryptographic product)
outside the USA and/or Canada may violate USA law, which the USA
may elect to enforce by arresting violators overseas and bringing them
to the USA for trial without benefit of extradition proceedings.
