John,

That's a brilliant (and deliciously devious) move! It never would've
occurred to me that the key escrow database held by Treasury--or even
parts of it--could be sprung loose with a FOIA request. I still have
my doubts, but your actions will certainly force some issues to the
fore.

Could the result be a change of the database holders to nominally
private firms, such as MITRE (actually a spook front) or Science
Applications Inc.? Or even organizaitions like the ACLU and CPSR
(which were proposed by some as escrow database holders)? Would this
exempt the Feds from the FOIA requests?
