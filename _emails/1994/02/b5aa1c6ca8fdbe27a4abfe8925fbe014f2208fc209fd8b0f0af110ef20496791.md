  It seems that most (if not all) of netcom's unix machines are SunOS
  based.  If that is the case, by installing NIT in the kernel, one
  would be able to grab all of the packets that flow across that
  ethernet (192.100.81)  This includes your remailer mail.  The "cost"
  to set this up would be the risk of being caught and the time and 
  trouble to come up with root on one of their sun machines.  Aside
  from the obvious legal risks, there are ethical considerations to 
  keep in mind.  While I personally would not attempt such a thing,
  there are many out there who feel otherwise.  

  I won't hack into mail.netcom.com to demonstrate that it is possible
  to figure out who used your remailer.  But, if one of the admins from
  netcom wants to send me their syslogs, I'll do my best to put together
  a correlation.

  Yes, but the trophy is hardly worth the effort.  Even though it wouldn't
  cost $50,000 in terms of actual equipment or time, it might well take
  such a sum to cause Perry to take the risk of being caught.  Unless the
  netcom folks are real slouches, I would think that they would notice
  that their kernel had been re-compiled and the machine rebooted.  Good
  luck not being detected...  Of course, there is always the off chance
  that they already have NIT compiled into the kernel...
