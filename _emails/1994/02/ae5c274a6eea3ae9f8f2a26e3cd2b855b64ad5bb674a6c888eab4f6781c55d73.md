| Question: How does one access RISKS 15.48

From the RISKS digest:

Date: ongoing
From: RISKS-request@csl.sri.com
Subject: Info on RISKS (comp.risks), contributions, subscriptions, FTP, etc.

 The RISKS Forum is a moderated digest.  Its USENET equivalent is comp.risks.
 PLEASE read it as a newsgroup if possible and convenient for you.
 Undigestifiers are available throughout the Internet, but not from RISKS.

 Contributions should be relevant, sound, in good taste, objective, cogent,
 coherent, concise, and nonrepetitious.  Diversity is welcome, but not
 personal attacks.  CONTRIBUTIONS to risks@csl.sri.com, with appropriate,
 substantive "Subject:" line; others may be ignored!  Contributions will not
 be ACKed; the load is too great.  **PLEASE** include your name & legitimate
 Internet FROM: address, especially .UUCP folks.  If you cannot read RISKS
 locally as a newsgroup (e.g., comp.risks), or you need help, send requests
 to risks-request@csl.sri.com (not automated).  BITNET users may subscribe
 via your favorite LISTSERV: "SUBSCRIBE RISKS".

 Vol i issue j, type "FTP CRVAX.SRI.COM<CR>login anonymous<CR>YourName<CR>
 CD RISKS:<CR>GET RISKS-i.j<CR>" (where i=1 to 15, j always TWO digits).
 Vol i summaries in j=00; "dir risks-*.*<CR>" gives directory; "bye<CR>"
 logs out. The COLON in "CD RISKS:" is vital. CRVAX.SRI.COM = [128.18.30.65];
 <CR>=CarriageReturn; FTPs may differ; UNIX prompts for username, password.
 WAIS and bitftp@pucc.Princeton.EDU are alternative repositories.

  IF YOU CANNOT GET RISKS ON-LINE, you may be interested in receiving it
  via fax; phone +1 (818) 225-2800, or fax +1 (818) 225-7203 for info
  regarding fax delivery.  PLEASE DO NOT USE THOSE NUMBERS FOR GENERAL
  RISKS COMMUNICATIONS; as a last resort you may try phone PGN at
  +1 (415) 859-2375 if you cannot E-mail risks-request@CSL.SRI.COM .

 ALL CONTRIBUTIONS CONSIDERED AS PERSONAL COMMENTS; USUAL DISCLAIMERS APPLY.
 Relevant contributions may appear in the RISKS section of regular issues
 of ACM SIGSOFT's SOFTWARE ENGINEERING NOTES, unless you state otherwise.
