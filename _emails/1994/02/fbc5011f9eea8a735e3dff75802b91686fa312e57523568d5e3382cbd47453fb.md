Well, considering that CERT is headquartered here at Carnegie Mellon
University, and the fact that cypherpunks is gated to a local group at
this site, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that they could be
reading this...

As I understand it, CERT is a private orginization funded by the
government (DoD I think, but not sure).  I'll ask on one of the local
message areas here and see what info I can dig up...
