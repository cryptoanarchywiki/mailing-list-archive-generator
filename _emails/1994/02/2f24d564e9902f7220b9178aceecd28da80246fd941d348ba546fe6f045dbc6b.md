Someone pretending to be "L." Deteiler posted an article, pretending to be
from Detweiler's account, that had a forgery of Tim May posting to all
the Cyphertentacles about how well the work he and Eric were doing
is going.  The real "L." Detweiler, of course, wouldn't have done so,
because that would be saying the tentacles are sufficiently different
humans that they need to send mail to each other, rather than
merely talking to herself; he or she would have posted a fake announcement
to the net or something like that.

:-)
