	Hmm, I tried to route a letter thru a remailer and to the usenet 
gateway at cs.utexas.edu and it has shown no bounce back or appeared in 
the propernewsgroup.  Is the utexas place still operating?

Or, did I do something wrong.  Basically what I did, was hit "R" in trn 
in order to make a reply, then I edited the headers and added the 
neccesary lines to forward the mail thru the remailer. hmm, or is the 
utexas place slow at sending out articles?
