Umm, with Clipper, will it be illegal to use other encryption in
addition to clipper ?

ie text -> des -> clipper -> des -> text

Or is that (other encryption being illegal) likely to be a result
of followup legislation ?

And also, how will anyone know if you are without several court
orders ? :-)  At least, now for the NSA, they don't have to worry
about legalities when it comes to decrypting DES (assuming they can)
so why would they push for Clipper if it restricted them more ?

(Sorry, I don't read much of the flame wars on this after the first
 few responses, if this has already been brought up)
