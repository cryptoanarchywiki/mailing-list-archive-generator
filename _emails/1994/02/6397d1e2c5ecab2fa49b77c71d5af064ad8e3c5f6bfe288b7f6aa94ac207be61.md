I never said this. Why do you think it is the only defense?
Why do you all mix ideas with calls for killing people?
Isn't it a difference whether I publish an idea or whether
I pray killing people? Is this allowed in your country?

You all seem to have a nice patent for defense against
Nazis. Why don't you tell/sell us this patent? It could
be very helpfull. 

Don't you believe that we are interested in a free press?
Don't you believe that we want to fight against Naziism?
How do you fight against your Nazis?

Arrrrrghl!  Stop this stupid tale! Do you want to play silly games
with me? Who did you tell that you have to go to any office in germany?

Exactly the same as in Germany! Many people do this! We printed papers
at the school, we print papers at the university, we do it everywhere.
Print anything with your computer, go to the next copy-machine. Print
as much as you can pay and carry and give it to everyone you want. It
happens nearly every day. When I began to study at this university I
got my half bag full of papers in the mensa every day. Meanwhile they
are printing less because noone reads them all, you can't read them
all, they are too many. At the first day at this university I got
invitations from two groups of homosexual groups, one invitiation of
the lesbians group, about 20 invitations of political groups and
a lot of paper I didn't even look at.

What is the use of press freedom if the press doesn't use it?

I'm sure you don't see much about Germany at all. Where did you get
all those stories?

Is this what you call press freedom?
