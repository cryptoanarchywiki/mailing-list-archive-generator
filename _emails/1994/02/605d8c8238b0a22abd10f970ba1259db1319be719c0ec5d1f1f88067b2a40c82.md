Yeah, it's him.  A couple years ago he was a nice guy.  For some reason
he got upset with a few people on cypherpunks (to this day I don't know
why), and ever since then he has been posting and sending them flames,
mailbombs, and harassing them in other ways.  Detweiler is a smart guy
with some sort of strange psycological problems.  Maybe he is on drugs
or something.  I don't know.  The things he does just don't make any
sense.
