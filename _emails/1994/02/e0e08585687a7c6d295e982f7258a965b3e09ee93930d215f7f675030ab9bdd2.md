Your system sounds great.  However, don't you have to be root to run
the server side of things (put it in /etc/inetd.conf)?  Or the
alternative is to leave a process continually running listening for
connections, right?  Leaving a process running isn't feasible for me,
even if it forks all the time (especially now with the recent security
problem on owlnet).

Or is there another way that an ordinary user can pull this off?  If
so I'd like to hear about it and work on an idea I've had for a while.
