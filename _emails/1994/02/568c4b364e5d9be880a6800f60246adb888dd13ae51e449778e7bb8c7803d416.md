I am proposing this as a practical solution that can be implemented 
effectively mainly on floppies.  Hard-drives might have to be dedicated 
to stegonagraphy (As Matt points out below).

So it seems.  However, I am wary of the possibility that there are 
drawbacks to the scheme that I haven't even considered yet.  I'm hoping 
that other astute readers such as yourself may be able to point them out; 
as, practical stegonagraphy may become a necessity in the near future.

My original post only outlined the basic premises.  I had not, at that 
point, realized that floppy use would be a virtual necessity.

Thanks for your insights and neverfailing tenacity, Matt.
