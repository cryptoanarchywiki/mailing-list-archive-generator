Unfortunately, though, it was pretty soft on Clipper.  Significantly,
the piece was not written by John Markoff, who's been covering cypherpunk-
and crypto-related issues for the Times for a while now.  Markoff has been
very friendly to "our side."  This other guy (sorry, name escapes me)
seemed to swallow the USG's line much more uncritically.  I wonder why
Markoff didn't write Saturday's piece? 

I'm not subtly suggesting conspiracy theories here, though I'm certainly
open-minded about them.  Mainly, I'm noting the difference between the two
guys' approaches and how strongly they affect the coverage.  I did a mini-
rant about the piece on my radio show Saturday.
