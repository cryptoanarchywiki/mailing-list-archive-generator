"Tim asked about "phone remailers" in one of his recent posts.  Until that
happens, remember that the anonymous phone cards offered by AT&T and
Western Union (and others) are almost as good.  This is especially true
if you "chain" call through two or more different phone cards."

Please post details of these. How do they charge you then? Must you use
a phonebooth?
