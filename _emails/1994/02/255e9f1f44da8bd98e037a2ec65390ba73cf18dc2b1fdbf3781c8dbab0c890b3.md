Hide your file in random locations in the image every time.  The image 
will be useless to your opponent, unless the hidden file has a 
standard header.

That would be nice.  Clipper may be widespread sooner, though.

Not at all!  Lets say hiding data in multi-megabyte core files becomes 
fasionable.  Your opponent suspects stegonagraphy.  What part of that 
core file are they going to analyze?  Assuming that no standard as to the 
location, size, or header of the file hidden within the core file exists 
your opponent has nothing to go on.  EFFECTIVE STEGONAGRAPHY!

It may not be possible for long.
