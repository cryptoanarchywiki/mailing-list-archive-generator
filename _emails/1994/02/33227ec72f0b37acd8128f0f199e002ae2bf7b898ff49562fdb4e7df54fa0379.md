Right, but the point is that you have to search for a prime q anyway;
PGP's algorithm is basically to repeat q += 2 until you find a q which
is prime.  It uses a sieve to speed this up a lot.  I was pointing out
that you can basically change the 2 to a 2^24, still use a sieve, and
find a key just about as fast.  So matching an existing key ID should not
take much if any longer than just generating a PGP key in the first place.

PGP actually uses a 64-bit key ID internally, only displaying the lower
24 bits for conciseness.  It would be practically impossible to get a
64-bit key ID collision by accident (well, almost impossible, anyway).
However, the technique I mentioned could easily generate such collisions.
PGP does check for the case of matching key ID and does something, but I
forget what.  24-bit key ID matches shouldn't have any effect except for,
as Bill says, extracting/deleting keys based on key ID.
