I am including this notice to cpunks since my group (ssz.com) will be there
and among other things we will be doing crypto related presentations. We are
also looking at getting some form of virtual-community going w/ 2600 and
Ripco. If any of the cpunk related sites would like to get involved then
please contact me or the Robot Group.

Note: my email address will soon also include ravage@ssz.com as well.

Note: ask for 'Jim' if you contact ssz.com or CyberTects.

We will have a T1 link available and you should also be able to use the T1
that is Ripco's feed as well. If all goes well you should also be able to use
my modem number assuming bga.com gets my SLIP feeds straightened out (not
there fault, GE is dragging and Ma Bell is ladding insalling the new lines).

If you don't have any interest in this event or feel it is irrelevant please
don't waste bandwidth, your time, or my time by replying. Please ignore it
and don't respond in any manner.
