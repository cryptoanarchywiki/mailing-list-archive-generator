-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Cypherpunks,

After reading Tim's ideas on second generations remailer, I decided to
try coding a new experimental remailer which includes some of the
features mentioned.  Because I am doing a couple of different things,
I wrote the scripts from scratch since I need the familiarity with the
code that comes from actually writing the whole thing yourself.
However, I don't think it will be hard to add these features to Hal's
code, if they are found desirable.  I've been testing for a while and
it seems to work.

* Send mail to barrus@tree.egr.uh.edu to enter the remailer.
Ultimately, mail will be remailed from elee6ue@rosebud.ee.uh.edu.
That is, there is a "mystery" processing point in between: mail ->
barrus@tree.egr.uh.edu -> ? -> elee6ue@rosebud.ee.uh.edu -> wherever.
I imagine it isn't difficult to figure out what the middle processing
point is, but I thought I'd distribute things around a bit.  

* Mail from ? to elee6ue@rosebud.ee.uh.edu will be encrypted, even if
the mail sent to barrus@tree.egr.uh.edu isn't.  So mail with a latency
delay will be encrypted as it sits at ?; mail with no latency will by
encrypted before travelling to elee6ue@rosebud.ee.uh.edu.

* The remailer elee6ue@rosebud.ee.uh.edu has been restored to normal.
That is, the "digital cash" (random strings) features has been taken
out.

* The remailer figures out whether the message is encrypted (with PGP)
or not.  So no encrypted pasting token; perhaps later I will add RIPEM
capability.

* Instructions to the remailer are of this form:

<instructions and stuff go here>

<body of message goes here>

The instructions come first, then a space, then your message.  The
original header of the message is thrown out (see *subject below).

For example, a valid message with the new remailer is:

- ----------8< cut here >8----------
Anon-To:klbarrus@owlnet.rice.edu
Subject:guess

Gee, I think I figured out where ? is.
- ----------8< cut here >8----------

Of course, message body may be further encrypted with the public key
of the remailed-to person, and the entire message (between the cut
marks) may be encrypted with the public key of the remailer.

* The following instructions are recognized:

Anon-To:address
Request-Remailing-To:address
Cut:cutmarks
Latent-Num:num1
Subject:text

	* Anon-To: and Request-Remailing-To: are really the same.
	The address specified is where to send the body.  If the
	address is /dev/null, whitehouse.gov, or null, the body is
	dropped.  If you attempt to mail to an*@anon.penet.fi, the
	address will be rewritten to na*@anon.penet.fi.

	* Cut: allows you to specify cutmarks.  DO NOT PUT A SPACE
	AFTER THE COLON UNLESS YOU WANT IT.  Thus

	Cut:-- specifies the cutmarks to be '--' (beginning of line,
	dash, dash, end of line) while

	Cut: -- specifies the cutmarks to be ' --' (beginning of line,
	SPACE, dash, dash, end of line), which is very different.

	Sendmail is invoked with -oi so putting a lone period in the
	first column should not end the message.

	You can specify (nearly) arbitrary cutmarks, which are matched
	against the body of your message.  If an exact match occurs,
	the rest of the body is not sent.

	If you specify cutmarks which also happen to be PERL
	metacharacters, the cutmarks will be changed to the default
	'--'.  I've tried to allow for the metacharacters to be
	cutmarks, but it just won't go.  If you happen to know how to
	do it, let me know.

	Try the cutmarks feature out before depending on it to save
	you.

	* Subject:text allows you to specify your subject.  When mail
	is received, the original header is thrown out.  After all,
	you can pad and multiply hop your message all over but if the
	subject remains "How I reverse engineered the Clipper chip"
	throughout it's trip, then you lose some security.  If you do
	not specify a subject, "Re: your mail" will be used.

	* Latent-Num:num1 lets you specify how many messages must come
	in (not necessarily be mailed out) before yours goes.  Pick a
	reasonable number or your mail may sit there for a real long
	time.

* Logging: I'm only logging whether an arriving message was PGP
encrypted or not, and the day of the month.  This is just to get an
idea of usage.

* I'll fill out Xenon's remailer disclosure list soon.  But this
remailer involved three seperate account on three different machines
so it might not fit into the current list very neatly ;)

Here is the public key for the remailer:

Other things I will be looking at implementing as time permits:

* Digital Cash - hopefully with the Magic Money code.

* Time Latency - letting a user specify when (timewise) before
remailing a message is remailed.  I will possibly combine this feature
with digital cash.

* Avoiding Sendmail - using an SMTP package Peter Honeyman sent me.
Maybe just telnetting to port 25 if that's good enough.

* Padding - Hal sent me some code to pad inside PGP messages; upon
decryption the padding is thrown away.

* Other ways to receive mail - that is, something like an altered fsp,
custom client/server code, or WWW in Nate's experiment.  Essentially
materialize the file at the remailer (without mailing to the remailer)
to be delivered later.  This will probably be undoable since I'm not
root.
