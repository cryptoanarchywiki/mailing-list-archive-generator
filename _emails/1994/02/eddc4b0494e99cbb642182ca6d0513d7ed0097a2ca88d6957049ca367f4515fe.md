While not _directly_ an encryption matter, it bears pointing out that
pure text seems to be falling under the tender ministrations of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

Reports in talk.politics.guns indicate that the Louisville, KY BATF has
informed a non-FFL (i.e., not a gun dealer, thus not under BATF
jurisdiction in the matter) Army-Navy store's proprietor that it would
be "shut down" if he did not remove from sale some Paladin Press titles
on illegal conversion of firearms.

According to followups, it's worse:  The State of Michigan has outlawed
such texts for some time now.
