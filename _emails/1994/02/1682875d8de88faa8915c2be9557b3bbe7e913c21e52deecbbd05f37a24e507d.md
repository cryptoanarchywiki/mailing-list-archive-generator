Well, the problem is that NETCOM has logs that are good enough that
THEY can trivally trace things if they want. Assuming they are doing
normal SMTP logging tracking you down should be easy. I would require
a network tap assuming that I wasn't going to have their help.
However, make no mistake that Netcom can and will cooperate with the
police if you use your remailer in a way that the government doesn't
like, so it seems that the security afforded isn't that good.

Without any information out of the network logs or the network itself,
no one is going to be able to say. Besides, $20 is a paltry sum for
the amount of work involved.

Netcom keeps logs.
