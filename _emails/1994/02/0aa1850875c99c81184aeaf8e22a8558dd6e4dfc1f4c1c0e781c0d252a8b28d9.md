Of *course* it's voluntary.  You don't have to use it!
(Pay no attention to that Digital Telephony Bill beind the curtain!)

Actually, it *is* voluntary - for the government.  They don't have to use it,
at least not currently, and they'll still leave themselves loopholes for
use of anything they want for national security, etc.
