I'm not sure this incident helps the pro-Clipper folks; after all, it
demonstrates how difficult it can be to keep any information truly
secret, particularly where others value it highly. Yesterday's local paper
said that perhaps 10 people died because Ames revealed them as agents;
will the government protect the key escrow data more carefully than it
protected the identities of those agents? How many more "secrets" are
known by others .. how sure are we that some of "us" aren't really
"them" instead ..?
