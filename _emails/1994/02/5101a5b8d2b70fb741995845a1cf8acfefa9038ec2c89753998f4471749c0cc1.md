I lost some list mail today. Could someone please forward me the missing
messages? These are the last ones I got. Everything between this and the
"KERT Advisory" joke is what I lost. Thanks, Mike

Some people have been asking how to run background tasks on Netcom.
How about this: have your task run, then send a ping to a remailer.
When the ping comes back, your .forward file will start the task back
up and it can run, then ping the remailer again.
