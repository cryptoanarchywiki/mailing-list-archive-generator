Yes. there are.

I am motivated from the other end. I can get the client code I need, I can't
get "widespead use" at the server end. For example, GMU, which
nominally provides Internet access to all of its students, refuses to
support SLIP or PPP on any of its servers. No reason, just policy.

I gave up on GMU's services and pay Netcom to give me access. They charge
$2.00 per hour for SLIP/PPP, but all the async access I want is flat rate.

Until the politics and economics change, I believe widespread use will
require a non-IP approach. Sure IP would be better, so would ISDN.

But Eudora and NUpop work fine, over straight async. they just miss the
encryption hook.

I have no interest in debating the value of IP. I am looking for help in
building a non-IP client that can enable encrypted mail to the
great mass of computer owners who are clueless about technology.
