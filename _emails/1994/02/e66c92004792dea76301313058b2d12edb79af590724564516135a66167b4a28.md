Untrue. In the U.S., you can publish a communist newspaper. Are
americans communists? No. You can also publish a Nazi newspaper. Are
americans all Nazis? No.

You can't do that via censorship.

Why not?

Ultimately they aren't.

In the U.S., I can print everything in a newspaper. The only exception
that has any significance is that if I print a story that deliberately
(note the word deliberately) lies about someone with intent to cause
them harm, they can sue me. However, the government cannot in and of
itself intervene in the content of newspapers.

Indeed, but this is in contrast to the U.S., where you are allowed to
say anything you like.

The problem is not free speech. The problem is the cultural notion
that it is right and proper for the government to intervene in
people's lives to "fix things". What you are doing is enforcing that
concept. It is not up to you to dictate what those 10,000 people are
allowed to read. They are adults and deserve the same consideration
that everyone deserves.

On the other hand, what you are doing is teaching the 10,000 people
that it is right and proper to oppress ideas as evil, to ban words, to
throw people in jail for what they have to say. You are also making
them far more interested than they otherwise would be in these words
that you will not let them hear. You are also creating a legal regime
under which when totalitarians take power they can ban the words of
democrats USING MECHANISMS THAT DEMOCRATS PUT INTO PLACE.

You are not succeeding via this method in stopping the spread of
totalitarianism. What you are doing, however, is succeeding in
becoming a totalitarian.

You seem to have missed an obvious point: the people are dying right
now even with censorship. Obviously censorship of neonazi propaganda
has not succeeded in stopping the murders. On the other hand, other
countries like the U.S. have not had widespread attacks against
foreigners in spite of the fact that I can pick up any sort of book I
want at any bookstore. Is it your contention that Germans are
irrational beings seperate from the rest of the human race that cannot
be trusted to make up their own mind about the evils of Naziism?

Since censorship has not stopped the right in Germany, perhaps you
could try the alternative approach, which is to try to convince people
that Naziism is wrong?

Once you stop communication, you are not free any more. You have
already lost.
