Netcom has a "policy against detached processes because of the load they
put on the system and therfore 'crontab' and 'at' disabled for all
users.(Netcom support)" To make your life even harder they kill all your
processes upon hangup.
Here is (half) the workaround:

They forgot to disable "sleep" and they also didn't disable "nohup."
You can simply write a script that sleeps for 30 min, executes your program
and goes back to sleep. Call it with "nohup script &" and you're in
business.

The next problem that must be addressed is the auto-logout upon >14min of
inactivity on the modem level that Netcom imposes on you. There is a simple
2 line command that you can add to your .login file to disable the
auto-logout. I saw it once posted in one of the Netcom newsgroups, but I
lost it. Perhaps you might post the question there. I would not advise to
ask Netcom support for it... Some of the messages responding to the above
post talked about "supending the account for intentionally disabling, blah,
blah" 8-)

Good luck,
