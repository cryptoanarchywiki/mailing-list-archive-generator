This may not be elegant, but it works well in my account. It checks
the entire Cypherpunk remailer network connections and is user friendly.

# Change this to reflect where your system has perl.

# SuperPing version 1.2: Ping Cyperpunk remailer connections.
# Now pings in both directions, as I have learned they are NOT equivalent.
# Brought to you by Xenon <na38138@anon.penet.fi>.
# Thanks to Alan Barrett for teaching me some perl.

# Warning: outputs ~40 e-mails at a time. May give "too many processes"
# error towards the end if you haven't killed all of your stopped jobs.
# Increase the sleep(sec) time if needed. 

# Be careful. If mail bounces between any two remailers in either
# direction, "Mr. Remailer Operator" will obtain a full mailbox! 

# To test the program, comment out all the remailers in the list and add
# YOUR address at least three times to the list of "remailers".

# You MUST make a file called .PingFile that contains:
#::
#Request-Remailing-To: your.address
#
#Ping!
#
#-----Begin Test-----
#Test
#-----End Test-----

# Will also function as a convenient method to shut down all remailers at
# once by making .PingFile 500K instead of 1K. Not recommended if you
# value your life ;-). 

# List of remailers (not complete). Make any line a comment to remove that
# line's remailer. cicada and pmantis are not meant for heavy traffic so I
# have removed them. Soda is commented for no particular reason.

# Output (with only catalyst, qwerty and rosebud checked) looks like this:

# S.1 qwerty > catalyst
# S.1 qwerty < catalyst
# S.2 rosebud > catalyst
# S.2 rosebud < catalyst
# S.3 rosebud > qwerty
# S.3 rosebud < qwerty

# These are printed out as the program progresses and they also appear as
# the Subject of each piece of mail.

# alias g '(grep Subject: /usr/spool/mail/n/name | sort -t. +1 -n) | more'
# will make the command "g" give a list of received pings, in order. /n/name
# is your part of the mail spool. You should also check that the received
# pings really came from the second remailer instead of getting short
# circuited by the first remailer.

# Sample output mail as received by a remailer:
# 
#From: Your name <your.address>
#Message-Id: <numbers@your.site>
#To: qwerty@netcom.com
#Subject: S.1 qwerty > catalyst
#Status: R

#::
#Request-Remailing-To: catalyst@netcom.com

#Request-Remailing-To: your.address

#Ping!
