I have recently finished my senior project on low-bandwidth coding
of speech.  I outline an implementation of Linear Predictive Coding
(LPC) on the ADSP2105.  I am making the paper and the source code
freely available in hopes that it may interest and possibly help
someone.  In order to avoid having to mail out copies seperately
to everyone who is interested I am putting the paper temporarily
on:

    ftp.uu.net:/tmp/lpc-paper.tar.gz

If you know of an archive for which this paper is suitable please
let me know how to submit it there or submit it yourself and let
me know.  The archive is a tar'ed collection of files, to unpack:

   gzip -d lpc-paper.tar.gz
   tar xvfp lpc-paper.tar

The contents of the archive are:

   Makefile
   README
   a4.sty
   lpc.ps
   lpc.tex
   lpc4b.asm
   notes.tex
   schematic
   schematic.ps
   source.tex
   
and contain postscript and LaTeX formats of the document. 

Here is the abstract:

\begin{abstract}
An implemenation of Linear Predictive Coding, a low-bandwidth 
speech encoding scheme, 
built around the ADSP-2105 signal processing CPU is described.  The
hardware schematics and software source code listing are included.
\end{abstract}

                                   Tim N.

(ps.  I am no longer subscribed to the cypherpunks list so
if you wish to reply, send the reply directly to me)
