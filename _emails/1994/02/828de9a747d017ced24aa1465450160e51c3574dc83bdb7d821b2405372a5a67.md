Just when you thought it was safe to go back on the internet...
He's baaaaack! Remailer operators, please lock him out now, before he
does whatever he is getting ready to do. Better yet, set it up so when
he sends to a remailer, he gets back a hundred copies, and one gets
forwarded to his sysadmin with his name on it.
