	Sad truth is, I would never get my admins permission to
	do so, so I need to either set up just a script to
	download my inbox //usr/var/spoolwhateveritis and then
	use emacs at home, like was suggested to me, with RNMAIL
	to read and reply and encrypt all my messages at home.
	This way my key stays secure.  All I really need to learn
	is how to upload all my new mail and then get it to be
	sent to the proper addresses.  Perhaps someone could help
	me write  a script for that.

	You're eqipped with a hundred billion nueron brain, that's
	wired and fired, and it's a reality generating device, but
	you've got too do it.  Free youself  ----Tim Leary----
