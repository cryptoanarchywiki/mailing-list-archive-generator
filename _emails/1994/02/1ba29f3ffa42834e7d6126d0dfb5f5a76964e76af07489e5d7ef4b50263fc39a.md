 A continual subject of debate has been the privacy of swiss accounts...
and lichenstein and luxemborg banks...
according to a recent text I read on the subject
the hot way to conduct banking in privacy by mail is to
a. use a canadian PO Box to avoid US mail covers on swiss postmarked 
incoming mail...
b. if the money is derived honestly(i.e. legitamate but underground businesses
simply underground for tax-avoidance) and NOT drug dealing derived
or from an offence that is also an offense in Switzerland, then
all privacy laws on swiss banks apply...tax avoidance is 
specifically excluded as an area where US. TLA can obtain cooperation
of swiss authorities.
c. Swiss Banks issue credit cards on accounts... :)
d. further privacy is derived via a trust or corporation in
Lichenstein and transferring the mony to said trust or corp from
a swiss bank...
e. A list of Swiss Banks to start with:
