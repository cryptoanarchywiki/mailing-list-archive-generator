Jon,

I guess you're right - if they're so clueless that they have to get you to
run grep for them they're clueless enough to be stymied by crypt - all you
have to do is go "Duh, its encrypted, I don't know how to uncrypt."

How long do you think it'll be before crypt disappears, though?

Are these machines connected to the net?  If so, pointing them in the
direction of the remailers might be a good thing.

Joe

P.S. I realize it is a lot easier for me to make these suggestions than
for you to implement them - I don't have to deal with the consequences.
