Hello,
	I'm George Miranda, a freshman at UCLA. I'm new to cyberspace, 
but I'm learning fast. I'm curious as to how one goes about setting up a 
snake or a tentacle, and further more, how you find out that a particular 
address is one. I might've tried my luck at SQUASH, but I was too late, 
and I do not know how to find snakes. I'd really appreciate it if you 
could clue me in as to how to go about setting up and finding snakes, as 
a favor from one cyberpunk to one in training. Thank you.
				
						Sincerely,
						George Miranda
