I personaly feel that anybody who bothers to go 'trashing' at my house 
already knows my name, S.I.N., address (obviously), phone number, and the 
status of my bank account. Anything more sensitive than the above does 
indeed get destroyed before disposal, and on days that I am feeling 
particularly paranoid, I add some 'interesting' fiction to my trash 
before I take it out...

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
