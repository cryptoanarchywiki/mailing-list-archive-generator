Dear Cypherpunks,

   "Captain Bob", posting as anonymous, subject NONE, has posted a most
disquieting post in reference to my original Privacy Digest post.
Urgently needed are the opinions of Black Unicorn, or possibly Sandy
Sandfort or Duncan Frissell as to whether or not the Costa Rican
reference I gave is a "STING".

   Cap't Bob says that the Privacy Digest people have not been around
very long. However, If I remember right, Eden Press referred to them
in their book PRIVACY more than ten years ago. Bob asks me what are my
qualifications? Well, I'm not an expert but if you look at me from the
correct angle I look like an expert.

   I posted the original Privacy Digest to other groups as well, so I
would like to send any criticisms of my post to these other groups.
                                                   Yours Truly,
                                                   Gary Jeffers
