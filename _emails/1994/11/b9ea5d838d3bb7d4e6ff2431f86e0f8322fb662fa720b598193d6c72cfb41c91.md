That the mailing list material was funneled through khijol to asar in an
obvious attempt to hide the poster's true identity doesn't bother me a bit.
What *does* bother me is taht Bill Wells tries to blame it on *me*, stating
that *I* was the one who posted the material.  Not that it's really relevent
*who* posted it, it just annoys me that the guy is so damned paranoid.  I
wonder why?  What's he afraid of?

Gee, sounds a little like LD...
