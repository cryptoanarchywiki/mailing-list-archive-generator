Check out:

	TIA/EIA Telecommunications System Bulletin
	Cellular Radiotelecommunications Intersystem Operations:
	Authentication, Signaling Message Encryption and Voice Privacy
	TSB51

Their idea of "Voice Privacy" is to repeatedly XOR a 260 bit session key
with the data stream.  I quote:

	8.2.47  VoicePrivacyMask (VPMASK)

	This parameter contains a 528-bit field consisting of two 260-bit masks
	used for voice privacy on a digital traffic channel.  One mask is for
	speech transferred in the inward direction (from the CSS toward the MSC)
	and one is for speech transferred in the outward direction (from the MSC
	toward the CSS).  These masks are calculated using CAVE parameters in
	effect when the call is established and remain constant for the duration
	of the call.

So, while analog calls are not encrypted, you can look forward to COMPLETELY
SECURE (sarcasm) digital transmission.

Wonder how much the Gov'mint bribed the phone companies for this stunt...
