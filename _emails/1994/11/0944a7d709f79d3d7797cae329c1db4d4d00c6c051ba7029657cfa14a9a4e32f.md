Why not go to one of the commercial providers or Freenets and ask 
for an account under a pseudonym? I don't get the impression that
Netcom cares what your account name is, and I imagine the other providers
are too busy to play identity police. If they're feeling picky and
you're feeling accomodating, tell them you want to pay for an account
for a roommate/spouse/partner/adopted child who doesn't have a 
checkbook/VISA card.
