   Morality and legality mean one thing when your future is assured, and 
an entirely different one when your getting into college may depend upon 
the very people whom you would piss off by refusing.

   No.  I'm a student, not a netadmin proper.  And I *REALLY* don't need 
the headaches involved with getting the FBI involved, even if I thought 
it was a good idea, which I don't.  I am extremely loathe to use the 
"authorities" on anyone, anytime.

   He is a wee bit of a twit, but on the other hand I would like to go to 
college and most of what I do is not reflected in my grades (2.3 GPA, 
1370 SAT) for reasons which I won't go into here.  Recommendations from 
the technical people at school are about all I've got, and I will do what 
I have to in order to get them.
