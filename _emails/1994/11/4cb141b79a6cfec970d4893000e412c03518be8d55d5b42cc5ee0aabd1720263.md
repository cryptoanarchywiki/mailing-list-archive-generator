That is exactly what chaining is supposed to prevent.

This is more correct than my previous statement. ALL remailers would be 
at risk.

I agree that it only makes it a little harder. I never meant it as a 
preventative and it never will be. But if the remailer is going to be 
used to send out large amounts of data, i.e. source code and spam, I 
wanted to increase the level of difficulty on the part of the individual 
committing the act.

>Or are you going to block posts from remailers that forward spam to you?
>(A cure worse than the disease, IMHO).

I have no intention of blocking the other remailers.
