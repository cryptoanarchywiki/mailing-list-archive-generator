   [...] delays will degrade
   the quality of discussion on the list (time lag for only some has
   a way fragmenting discussion, as anyone with a sometimes-slow link
   can attest).

If the delays remained entirely unexpected or random, quality would
degrade.  Humans, however, have an uncanny ability to modify their
own behavior.

I am also willing to risk a small amount of degradation to encourage
people to actually use encryption tools.

   If you are set on this idea, may I echo someone else's suggestion
   of an autoresponder to annoy those posting without signing? 

I think this is a good idea which will help the communication intent
of the whole proposal.

   [...] we all still know who is not signing [...]

Having notification that a message wasn't signed was never presented
as one of the purposes of the proposal.

Eric
