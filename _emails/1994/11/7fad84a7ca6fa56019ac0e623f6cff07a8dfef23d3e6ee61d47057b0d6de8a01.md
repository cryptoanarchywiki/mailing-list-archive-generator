I commend Ed Carp for his endeavors in this regard; IMHO he's done a splendid
job of both advertising and explaining his remailer in asar (name is a relic,
it would be in alt.recovery.* if it were created today). khijol seems to 
command a fair amount of respect there. I think he's seen as part of the
community, so to speak, and that helps a great deal. I hoped to participate
more actively in asar when I cranked up underdog, but other tasks have 
distracted me.

This line of defense appeals, but the technical details seem to tell against
it. :[  Remailers can quite easily be modified only to post to select
groups, so posting to Usenet in general is tough to defend this way. Even 
then, someone could decide to repost all of clari.news.sex to asar, which
would probably piss off everyone in asar as well as BT.  Meanwhile, there's
no way to restrict use of a remailer to private mail on certain topics,
unless you take a page from Bill Wells' book and monitor all the traffic. :<

I concur. I recommend directing followups to asar.d (full name is
"alt.sexual.abuse.recovery.d") to avoid flames. IMHO John Grohol's Pointers
to Psychology & Support Newsgroups biweekly posting establishes a good
paradigm.  If this hasn't already been done, it would be nice to compile
some things like remailer.help.all@chaos and remailer-list@kiwi into an
official biweekly FAQ posting to alt.privacy.anon-server,
alt.anonymous.messages, alt.answers, and news.answers. (N.B. Crossposting of
*anything* in asar is generally taboo. I think the Pointers to Psych Groups
list gets away with it, using followups out of asar.)
