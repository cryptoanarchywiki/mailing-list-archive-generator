C'punks,

Did anyone but me notice that Eric Hughes and Tim May have
reached a consensus in the on-going debate about signed posts?

Tim says, "your house, your rules" and acknowledges that Eric is
the de facto boss of the list.  Tim expresses no real objection
to Eric's first step except in a "slippery slope" sort of way.

Personally, I'm against mandatory digitally signatures as a
rerequisite for posting to Cypherpunks.  On the other hand, I
like the idea of having the list software automatic verify
digital signatures.  This is a valuable service I'm usually too
lazy to perform for myself.

Here's my suggestion.  Eric should unilaterally impose his first
step, i.e., all unsigned messages and messages with spoofed
signatures will henceforth be flagged as such.  Let's see what
effect, if any, that has on the way people post their messages.
After the protocol has been in effect for some time, we can
re-open the topic for further discussion.
