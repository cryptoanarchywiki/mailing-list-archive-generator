There are very sophisticated NAA scanners for luggage which can
detect minute amounts of explosives.  Despite prodding by the
Feds, airlines have balked at forking over the hundreds of
millions of dollars that would be required to install them at all
airports.

While the technique works nicely on baggage, I think there would
be some resistance to "neutron activation" of passengers. :)

That is why I said in my last message that I knew of no method of
remotely detecting currency carried by persons which was both
inexpensive and posed no health risks.  All RF techniques can be
pretty easily defeated and NAA is not acceptable for use on
living creatures.
