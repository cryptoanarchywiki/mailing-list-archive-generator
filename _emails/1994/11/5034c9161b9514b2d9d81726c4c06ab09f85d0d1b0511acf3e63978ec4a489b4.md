Uh... don't think your program would have done much good with that sig 
anyway.  'Twas a spoof by L. Todd Masco to drive home a point (and a 
well-done spoof, I might add!)

Out of curiosity, exactly what is your program?  What platform does it 
run on?  It might be interesting as a good solution to the auto-reply 
proposal, especially if it can be made cross-platform.
