In view of the situation at CMU and McGill a stray idea crossed my mind. If
someone were to set up some mailing lists which routed the content of the
particular usenet group to the subscribers, this would stymie big brother
to a certain extent. The problem would be that they could possibly block
certain domains from incoming e-mail to thwart this. A solution would be to
dummy up the from address. Daily the address would or could change, thus
frustrating the powers that be. An additional solution would be to throw
encryption into the list software so that each message would be encrypted
to it's recipient, further frustrating the powers. Another concept would be
to daily blast an encrypted packet (SOUP or whatever) to the subscribers of
the list. They could then post replies or follow ups through a mail ->
usenet gateway.
