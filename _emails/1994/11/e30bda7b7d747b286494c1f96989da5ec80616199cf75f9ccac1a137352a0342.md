There are at least a dozen that are read-only. Finger
lesikar@tigger.stcloud.msus.edu for the full list. There is exactly one
that will let you post: newsserver.rrzn.uni-hannover.de
<Yes, I know where it is.> However, it won't confirm your posts. Just hit
cancel 30 seconds after you hit post. The message will be posted. Better
yet, find a private service provider that will let you use their
newsserver. How do you inted to access the newsserver without an account,
anyway?
