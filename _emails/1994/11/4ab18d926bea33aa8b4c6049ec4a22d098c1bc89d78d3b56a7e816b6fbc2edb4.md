The discussion we've seen here re the reputation of the anon
server at twwells.com has found its way to the a.s.a.r.
newsgroup.  Most, if not all, of the thread has been posted
there via the khijol anon-server, including Tim's repost of
Mr. Wells' remarks to the list.

These posts to a.s.a.r. evidently prompted this from Mr. Wells:

And the posts have apparently caused one user of Wells' service to
become a former-user:
