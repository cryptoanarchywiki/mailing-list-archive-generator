If you're going to do this, I'd much prefer that you put this in the
header or in a Comment: field in the PGP block. My mail program
automatically verifies all signed messages (except those that get trashed
by MIME-mailers), but if it's got cack like this at the top of the message
then it (deliberately) displays the whole thing and doesn't verify the
signature.

This is in some respects a bug in my program, however I've been unable to 
come up with a sensible method of dealing with messages when only part of
them is signed.
