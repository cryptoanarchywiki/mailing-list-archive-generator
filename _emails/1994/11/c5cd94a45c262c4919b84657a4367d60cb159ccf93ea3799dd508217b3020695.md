I have written a freeware encryption program for the Macintosh that,
I feel, offers the strongest encryption for the Mac to date.

Paranoid  allows you to encrypt files with IDEA, triple DES,
or a third algorithm which I wrote (your choice).

Paranoid also allows you to encrypt files into sounds.

The only known bugs are in the grammar of the readme file. :)

Paranoid is available by FTP from FTP.CSN.NET:

first you must read the file /mpj/README which explains the legal
restrictions for retrieving certain files.  Paranoid will be
available as 

	/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/paranoid/Paranoid1.0.hqx

where ??????  changes  at random times (as explained in the README file)

in URL format, the files are:

ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README

ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/paranoid/Paranoid1.0.hqx


the file is also available at RIPEM.MSU.EDU at

ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/other/paranoid-1.0-mac-idea.hqx

but check first the README file in that directory for instructions.
