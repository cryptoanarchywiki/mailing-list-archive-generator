Well, like I said, it's the alt groups that I'm worried about.  I have
an excellent net connection at work, being employed by a subsidiary of
Rockwell, but our news feed is politically correct.  I have access to
two accounts with full feeds, but one is not a shell account, and the
other one is the school account which goes away in a another year
(depending on how long I can drag out the degree), unless I start taking
post-grad classes.

So, my hope is that I can use gnus to talk to some other newsserver than
the censored local one.  I will try some of the places that were posted.

As far as the private newsserver provider goes, I'd go for it (when the
time comes), if I could buy just access to Usenet for a discount.  For
that matter, maybe a couple of years from now the Republicans will have
figured out a way to shut down the alt groups.  ;-)

I'm better off if I keep taking classes, anyway.  Don't know about the
rest of the folks on this list, but I don't feel like what I know about
computers today will carry me through retirement.
