Responding to msg by Mike McNally:

"Put yourself in his place.  Mr. Templeton's attitude 
makes perfect  sense.  The entire fabric of his 
business is based upon  state-supported protection of 
the "property" that's his stock in  trade.  I would 
think very little of him as a businessperson were he  
to simple roll over and give up."
........................................................

Businessmen must find a way to channel  their goods & services 
so that they can reach their customers and receive the desired 
return on their efforts and their investments.

It's a paradoxical quagmire, isn't it, to be both open, 
available, and accessible, while yet needing to be exclusive, 
particular, and restricted.
