It does not work.

     Correct. A number of people have run tests on the strips (no, I didn't
archive the articles, they were about 5-6 months back) and they are just
what they appear to be, inert plastic strips put in there to make faking
money more difficult. Many paper currencies arounf the world use plastic or
metal foil strips in their money to make the bills more difficult to
reproduce. I am familiar with the Israeli shekel (NIS) that has had foil
strips in it for years...
     The main problem with detecting the strips is that it is faily trivial
to have a detector that will determine if some strips have gone through, but
having one that detects with any accuracy would be difficult to manufacture
and still keep paper currency proportionately cheap. I suppose
mini-transmitters in the 400 or so $10,000 bills might not be too far
fetched, but it seems ridiculous.

Assuming many falsehoods is scary... Now if only I could finish my mind
reading aparatus...


     Chalk this up with the FCC licensing modems and MAKE.MONEY.FAST
