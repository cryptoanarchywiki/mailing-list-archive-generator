i've written a major upgrade to hideseek, a steganography program i wrote 
for dos.

the guy who was keeping it on his ftp site for me (xenon@netcom) isn't 
answering my mail so i have no where to put the new version.

1) does anyone want to look at the program?
2) does anyone know of a good ftp site for the program?
3) thanx
