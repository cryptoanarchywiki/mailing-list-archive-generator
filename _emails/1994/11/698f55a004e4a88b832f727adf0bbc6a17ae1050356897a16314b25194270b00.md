As a personal policy I don't sign usenet news or mailing list
postings, unless special circumstances arise, I sign most personal
email where the text will be longer than the signature, or I know the
other person is a proponent of PGP, and I encrypt messages to people I
know can receive them without too much pain.  I don't sign/encrypt to
mailing list, as many people get disgruntled by it, and can cause
problems of it's own.

I suspect that most people on the list have worked with PGP at some
point, simply because of the nature of the list.  I don't see a
problem with signing/encrypting to Cypherpunks for 90% of the people
that contribute.

How about just an annoyance responder that sends a piece of mail to
people who post without signing/encrypting, telling them they should
be encrypting, that it's the preferred method of doing things, and to
do so in the future if possible?

As a side note, if you want people to sign their notes, why aren't you
doing so now?  I apologize if this has already been asked and I missed
it, and it's not intended as a flame, but it would seem that signing
your own messages would be a good way of starting things toward the
direction you want to go.
