In message <199411171606.AA18990@xtropia> you write:

Good idea in theory but won't work in practice. The stats generated by the
anonymous remailer show that less than 40% of the messages passing thru
are encrypted. Most people would find being forced to encrypt a huge
inconvenience. BTW everyone, when I say stats, I mean the primitive stats
generated by the remailer and are available to anyone sending email to
remailer@jpunix.com with the subject being remailer-stats. Don't start
asking me if I get these stats by logging! I don't log.

You are talking about fortress remailers. This is currently under 
discussion. Stay tuned.

Good in theory once again, but bad in practice. This would entice the
abusers to jeopardize several remailers instead of just one. Every
remailer that spam/proprietary-stuff goes through would be potentially at
risk also. If remailers are going to be legally jeopardized, I would 
think the impact would be less if it were one instead of many. But, there 
is also safety in numbers. Hmm...
