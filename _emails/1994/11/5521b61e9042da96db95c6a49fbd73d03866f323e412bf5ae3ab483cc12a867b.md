I realize I can't enforce this perfectly.

My goal isn't to force people to use encryption, it's to cut down on my 
risk as a remailer operator.  Basically, I'm going to make sure that 
there are headers, a pgp version number, and that there are no obvious 
problems with the text (ie. no whitespace, full length lines, etc.)  
Someone who really wanted to make trouble for me could still do it with 
my remailer, but I think that someone who wanted to mail death threats or 
post forbidden material would probably use another remailer as the final 
hop.

Your letter has brought a fairly serious flaw in my plan, though:  it's 
possible to simply ascii-armor a binary with PGP isn't it?  A brief scan 
of the pgp docs hasn't revealed the command, so I can't tell what an 
ascii-armored binary looks like, but I'll be it's just like cyphertext.  
That means I'll probably have to read the ascii-armor if I want to do 
this.
