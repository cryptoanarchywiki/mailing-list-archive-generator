   I know, but I'm a little squeamish about leaving my keys unprotected.

Then make up separate insecure keys for transmission to the host.  Add
an attribution which says to disbelieve any signature made with this
key.

   Also, I'm not very fond of the idea that encrypted email would be 
   decrypted when it got here and left in plaintext on the mail spool.

Some protection is better than no protection.  Protection in transit
is still protection, even if it is not universal.

   Otherwise it
   wouldn't be practical to use this setup in an office or school
   environment, because anyone could boot your machine with a floppy and
   steal your key. 

That's a different threat than interception of mail, remember.  A
partial solution is better than none.

One of PGP's many problems is that it's policies for key use are quite
restricted.  There's no way, for example, to make a receive-only key.

Not if you read mail on-line, while also reading News.

I strongly doubt that _anyone_ is not using crypto because of
something so trivial as a .5 or 1.5 or even 4.5 second delay. No, the
issues are that handling encryped messages is, for too many of us,
_much_ more than a 1.5 seconds per message delay. Several of us have
outlined the steps.

Are we just lazy? No, in some cases we're at home, pretty much
relegated to dial-ups like Netcom. In other cases, on VAXes, or
terminals, or AVIIONs. Whatever. Again, described repeatedly.
