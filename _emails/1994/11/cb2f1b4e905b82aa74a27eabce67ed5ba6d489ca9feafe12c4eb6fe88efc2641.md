Knumbskull Alert!

On the transparent e-mail topic, I send the presumably 
anonymous mail headers below received here by way of The 
Pipeline provider.

Would some kind soul verify that the headers do not disclose 
the true ID or true address or true path other true info that 
would identify the prayerfully anonymous sender?

Every piece of mail coming here has such headers. Does everyone 
else get the same?

FWIW,  the mail system automagically lists the sender and the 
subject in a neat chart, and hides the header if commanded to 
do so, or reveals it to the prying mind.

Thanks.

John Young (signing until forbidden)

PS:  It's true that Pipeline was cracked last Saturday and the 
system shut down for a while "due to a security breach".  The 
story in the WSJ about the "Internet Liberation Front" 
explained more than we clueless subscribers were allowed to 
know -- as the story said, corporations don't want us babes to 
know about our vulnerabilities, we might demand better service.
