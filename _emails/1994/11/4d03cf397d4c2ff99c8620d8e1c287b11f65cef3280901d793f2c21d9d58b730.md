:Dave Merriman - who remembers stuff like "64K? *64K*?! I don't know what
:I'd _do_ with 64K!" and when only the filthy rich had hard drives.

As someone in my early 20s..... my first computer had 16K of ram and a 300
baud tape deck.....

Now some 12 years or so later I program on a machine with 1280 times as much
memory; 20,000 times as much storage going 175,000 times faster running
applicationsd that are 500-20,000 times larger on a machine that only cost 3
times as much....

So WHY where the games of my old 8-bit so much more fun? And what will I be
using in the year 2006? Things could get truly scary..... as always I await
the future.....
