CPUNKS symposium this next Wed, November 30.

   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at Hops Brewery 

were I hope to discuss "What's your fingerprint?" and other related topics. 

Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint.  If you can figure out
how to get it on the back of a business card, that would be cool
(mailing labels work).

Place: Hops Brewery at the UTC Mall
Time:1800
Directions: University Town Center is at 805 and La Jolla Village Drive.
     From 805 head west until you get to Genesee and make a left.
     On Genesee make a left at the  first light and  turn into the mall.
     Hops will be directly in front of you.

Recon shows that there are lots of alternative locations with lots of
tables close by. Try to be there by 1830, as  we may decide to move
the meeting.

I will be standing wearing a  BRIGHT PURPLE BICYCLING JACKET.

See you there!

looks in the dictionary, she/he won't know that your are really going to a
drinking party!
BEWARE:  There is an anarchist in the group!
