| As one who will be shopping for a cell phone in the next week, what should
| I look for in terms of security? What features are available in phones on
| the market....if any?

	Nothing real is available now.  There is a Boston company that
sells an attachment that does variable split band inversion with 8k
variances per second.  You can buy two units, or call their computer
(via an 800 number) and get connected out.  Safecall is the company.
