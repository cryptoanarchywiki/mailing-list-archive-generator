Internet custom and precedent, as I understand it, seems to be 
that Usenet newsgroups are the collective property of the
regular inhabitants, but that mailing lists are the private
and individual property of the guy whose account they run out
of.

Even the commies on alt.politics.radical-left seem to be 
reluctantly and painfully accepting this doctrine.  I am 
amazed that an ex-extropian does not.

We can advise Eric that we think it might have an undesirable
effect if he manages the list in certain ways.  We cannot
tell him that it is unfair or unjust to manage the list in
certain ways.

The extropians list claimed to be managed in accord with the
principles of justice.  Eric makes no such grandiose claim.

The debates concerning ownership on extropians occurred because
of that claim and, in my judgment, because the claim was obviously
bogus.

agreed.
