	They can definitely be found at
duke.bwh.harvard.edu:/pub/adam/mcip 

They require an Apple Events aware PGP (2.3 v1.1 or Viacrypt).  Also
in that site is the macpgp kit, which is an interface to do crypto
stuff on the clipboard.  There is no copy of PGP stored there, for
2.3v1.1, goblin.dsi.unimi.it:/pub/security/crypt/PGP.  For Viacrypt,
contact viacrypt@acm.org
