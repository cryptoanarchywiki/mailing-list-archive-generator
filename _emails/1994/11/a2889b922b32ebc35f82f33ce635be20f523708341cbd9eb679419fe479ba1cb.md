This is exactly the sort of thing I'd like. I asked about this earlier but
didn't get a very positive response. I haven't found a convenient way of using
existing CP remailer features to:
1. accept encrypted mail, decrypt it and forward plaintext
2. receive mail for my pseudonym, _encrypt_ it and forward it to me

Such a remailer with a simple interface would, in my opinion, be the ideal 
'entry level' remailer for a wide audience.

(1) apparently can be managed, but I couldn't figure out a simple way to do
(2) with current remailers.
