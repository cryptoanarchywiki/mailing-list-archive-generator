This is a good idea - certainly a nice way to emphasize (sp) signing 
posts. Having majordomo verify signatures automatically and add message 
content if either (as sandy suggests) signature is missing or bad.

One question would be whether majordomo should add content upon 
verification of a signature, or upon failure to verify a signature (missing 
or bad). Depends on which would have most 'positive' appearance, and 
(more importantly) would generate least extra volume in the long term. 
Personally I think that flagging the messages with bad or missing 
signatures is a better idea - as more people sign articles on the list 
there will be less flagging volume sent out by md.

Nice idea Sandy.

... only snag is that md has to be modified again. Has Eric the time and 
desire to fit this in. I can't help with the perl - still not grokked it 
properly.
