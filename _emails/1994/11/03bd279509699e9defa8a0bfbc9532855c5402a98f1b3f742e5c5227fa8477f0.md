A couple of weeks ago, I paid a utility bill with a $50 FRN.  I was
amused(?) to see the clerk put the bill into the same printer they use to
print a little strip of payment receipt info on the bottom of your printed
bill and also on the bottom of some of their paperwork.  I guess they wanted
to trace the bill back to my account if it turned out to be phony.
