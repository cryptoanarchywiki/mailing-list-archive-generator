I am using PGPTools to handle all the crypto functions in the second generation
remailer that I have written. All the copies of PGPTools that I have found seem
to be set up to compile on SUN workstations only.

Mixmaster is both a remailer and a front end, and therefor must run on many
different platforms. I have been able to compile PGPTools on Linux and FreeBSD,
but PGPTools produces invalid RSA blocks. If you (or anyone else reading this)
have ported PGPTools to other platforms could you send me the source and
makefile, or point me to them. If not, could you help me do it, the source code
is a tangle, and it will take me a long time to do on my own (I am a brute force
programer, not a C wizard).

   Many thanks
      Lance Cottrell
