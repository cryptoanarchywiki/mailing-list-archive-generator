I've always assumed that the excitement behind the Digital Telephony
bill was to go after VoicePGP. My prediction is that the Internet
alone is legal but the Internet plus VoicePGP can't be deployed
without someone building in the wiretaps for the government. Since
no one owns the Internet and no one can add the wiretap ability,
then the Internet + VoicePGP will be verboten. Since they can't
very well ban the Internet, they'll just ban using VoicePGP on 
public networks. But, you'll be free to use it in the privacy
of your own home. That's my latest paranoid thought.
