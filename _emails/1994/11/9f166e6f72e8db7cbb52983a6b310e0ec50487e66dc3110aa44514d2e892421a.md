It seems we have pretty much reached a consensus. Eric should implement a
way to flag un signend posts. [Loved the various headers in Eric's post.
They were real funny.] After this is implemented lets se how it works and
see what else should be done.

However, I agree that this is Eric's list and Eric's rules. If he decides
that it would be a Good Thing to incentivise us Cypherpunks to use more
crypto when posting to the list, he is free to do so with our without
anyone's consent.
