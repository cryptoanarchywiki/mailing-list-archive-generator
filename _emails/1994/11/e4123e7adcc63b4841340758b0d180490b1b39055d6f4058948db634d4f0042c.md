i have successfully compiled pgp2.6.2, pgp2.5, pgp2.6.1 etc on a VAX.  
there are some modifications that usually need to be made when building 
rsaref (modifications to the rsabuild.com file i believe) that simply 
comment out a couple lines that are not required to build pgp but that 
are required to build the whole rsaref library.

i think the important lines to remove or comment out with a '!' are

$ call compile md2c
$ call compile md5c

please write if you need more assistance than this.

I cannot fathom people who seem to insist on taking their doses of
reality rectally.
