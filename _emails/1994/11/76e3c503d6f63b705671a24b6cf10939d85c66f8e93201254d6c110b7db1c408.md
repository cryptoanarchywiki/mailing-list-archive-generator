     I whole heartedly agree! Thank you Alex for pointing out the real issue. 
ObPlug: (I am currently writing a handbook on what intellectual property law
can be used for when developing crypto systems, either to make a profit or
to keep them free from commercial entanglement.)
     Tomorrow (San Diego Cypherpunks meet at Hops) I was planning on asking
Phil Karn what Qualcomm was planning with Eudora as far as any PGP hooks, or
if we need to to get of our rear-ends and design a mail application that
will implement PGP for all the SLIP users on Windoze & MacN'trash systems.
     Sure there are those of us who can use LINUX and various scripts to
bring PGP into our mailers, but a well built app that would get PGP to the
lay people who want their privacy is needed. So, Cypherpunks write code.

     o Get off our collective asses and write something for:
          SLIP / PPP in windoze, mac, ( & warp?)

     o Make it free, widely available, and either stand alone, or compatible 
          with Eudora.

     o Collectively demand that Qualcomm do something or else...

     o See if there are any software companies willing to take up the challenge.

     o Meanwhile, see what works for people... Create a contest for who has
the best system for ELM, PINE, EUDORA, etc...

     o What about windoze scripting? PCTools for windoze scripting? Other
scripts?


     I am willing to help, but I'm in the middle of Law school finals so any
help will be delayed...

     Adam
