At which time someone will go "Gee, what are they about?"

The announcement, in my opinion, *is* pointer.  What would be unacceptable
is the posting of said document with a note saying "Here's something I

Were they relavent to each of the lists?  I feel they are relavent to this
list.  You're the one on multiple security lists.  Surely it falls on you
to cope, not for the list to cope around you.
