What worries me about most of these PC "DoD" file erasers is that
I am reliably informed that on at least one occasion, 11 generations
of data have been recovered from a generic SCSI hard disk.  It was
a very unusual circumstance (suspicion of data leakage from a very
high security site), but I find it difficult to take 5-pass programs
very seriously.
