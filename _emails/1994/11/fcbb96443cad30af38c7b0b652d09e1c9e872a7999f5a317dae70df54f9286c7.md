I've also installed premail as /usr/lib/sendmail, and it works fine.  I 
haven't had any problems with it reading my ~/.premailrc file.

I was a little queasy about installing it as sendmail, but I'm very glad I
did.  It hasn't caused any problems at all, adds a lot of functionality,
and doesn't seem to extract too high of a penalty in terms of overhead. 

I'm not sure how sendmail forks for incoming mail, but my impression is
that the additional instance of sendmail is created without calling
premail.  If that's true, then premail installed as sendmail doesn't add
any overhead at all for incoming mail.  This was a big concern for me, 
because I don't have very much memory or processor power, but so far 
everything's been working great.
