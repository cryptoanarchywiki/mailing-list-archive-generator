(My apologies for losing the article to which this is relevant)

This is in regards to compiling PGP, and distributing it to those of us who 
are on restricted systems.

My provider, the state government does not allow me (or anyone 
else) to use cc. The platform is DEC Alpha OSF/1, and if anyone has 
access to a compiler and would be willing to put the binaries for 
PGP(preferably 2.6.2, but I'll take what I can get :) and/or gcc up for 
ftp somewhere, I would be very grateful.
