   The return address on the brochure I copied from is:

Financial Engr. Consultants, Inc.
Box 959
Centro Colon Towers 1007
San Jose, Costa Rica

   Well, I guess that we really can't give them much of an enthusiastic

                                                       Yours Truly,
                                                       Gary Jeffers
