I've thought about it, and am just starting to climb the OLE learning
curve (I am reasonably familiar with Windows programming with MFC).

This of course would assume a native windows PGP, a feat that would
require substantial rewriting of PGP itself.  This is something I will
not undertake since PGP itself is apparently going to heavily
changed/updated in the future (PEM compliance, dbm files for keyrings,
an API, etc.) and I don't want to put effort in an evolutionary dead
end.

But after that, making PGP an OLE client wouldn't be too much extra
work.  Then you could link/embed OLE items into a PGP document (such
as Word, Excel, Write, Paint, Sound Recorder, any other OLE server
items).  Actually, embedding would be necessary since a mere link
wouldn't survive encryption and decryption on a possibly different
machine (i.e. the link would point to meaningless memory).

The fancier approach would be to make PGP an OLE server as well, such
that you could link/embed a PGP document (encrypted text, signed text,
etc.) into other apps.  Again, embedding would be necessary.

If PGP were an OLE client, you ould embed graphs, pictures, sound,
spreadsheets, etc. into a document, and encrypt the document.

If PGP were an OLE server, you would embed encrypted pictures,
encrypted spreadsheets, encrypted cound, etc. into a document and mail
the document.  Of course, it would seem easier to just embed OLE items
and encrypt the document once.

I don't know what the prefered behavior is.  I lean towards PGP as an
OLE client.
