Abstract:

Traditional one-way payment mechanisms, such as cash, credit cards,
and digital cash, presuppose the necessity of payment validation in
advance of the completion of a transaction.  In contrast, a "closed
loop" protocol that verifies both payment information and customer
satisfaction permits a far simpler payment engine in an open Internet
environment, and is well-suited to a broad sub-class of Internet
commerce applications.  In this talk, I will present the underlying
philosophy, design rationale, and specification overview for a
recently-developed set of open protocols for information commerce.

Andrew Message System, ATOMICMAIL, Metamail, Safe-TCL, and
_Programming as if People Mattered_.)
