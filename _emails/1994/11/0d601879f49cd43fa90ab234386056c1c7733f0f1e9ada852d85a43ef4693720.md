This one has been flying around ever since the strips were
put in place. It has been refuted as techically infeasable.
(I don't remember the exact arguement, it had to do with the
strips being mostly nonreactive and there being no real way to
count how many/what denomination is in a stack.)

Also, realize that some places to look for that strip and if you
pull it it might not be accepted (most places that check only look
at $50s and $100s, though).
