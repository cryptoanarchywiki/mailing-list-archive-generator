This is even truer in most other countries. For instance, in the UK, 
interception comes under the authorities' prerogatory powers, and is not 
equivalent to (or balanced by other laws as) 'search and seizure'. India, which
derives its laws from the UK, faces a similar situation though here the
powers are 'statutory'.
