   A direct quote from him saying the above would be a nice tool the
   next time kiddie porn and terrorists are thrown out for the press
   to chew on.

I recall hearing that Inman lost a tremendous amount of credibility in the
government and the media during the confimation; there appeared the press
afterward some articles about how undeserved his sterling repuation was
after he "babbled on about his paranoias" during the confirmation.  Someone
with more information about the hearings could post the transcripts and
news articles. My impression of him during the class was that Inman was
well informed and on top of things.  But it's debatable the degree to which
a direct quote from him would sway the press.
