I presume you mean quoted-printable mail messages.  Some mail readers do do
this inappropriately, and some do it for reasons that may not seem
appropriate (like an initial line consisting of "From", to try and keep the
message content unmolested by Mail Transport agents.

Use the "setenv NOMETAMAIL" I mentioned earlier.  I thought you used Mac
Eudora, though.  That, at least in relatively recent versions, is very MIME
intelligent.  It changes the announcements into an Anarchie document and a
Eudora email message document to retrieve it by email.
