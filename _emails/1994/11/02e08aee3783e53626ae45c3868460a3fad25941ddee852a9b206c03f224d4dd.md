   Well, it's easy to require people to include PGP signatures.

And, as I've said, that's not what I'm talking about.

   On the other hand, how carefully were you planning to make your
   system check signatures - does toad.com have the spare cycles
   to validate them all, or are you really going for syntax only?

Well, I was going to do syntax only, because the real benefit is in
changing local software architecture to make automatic any operation
on outgoing mail.  If that operation is encryption, so much the
better, but the larger strategic goal is to alter architecture.
