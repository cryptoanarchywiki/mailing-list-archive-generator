What sort of scientific computations are you doing if I may ask? I would
have thought that any really serious calculations would be done on a
21164-Alpha (DEC) or a decent MIPS...... still then the OS costs more than
free.

Its a very obscure bug, very obscure. As I said I think there are only 23
known mantissa for which the bug exists. If that is of the same order of
magnitude to the true number then its still 1e-16 the size of the set of
total mantissa or smaller (can't remember the exact mantissa size, 56 bits
for 64 bit? whats if for 80 though?)

I think its unlikely that any more serious bug will exist in the FPU core
after this - it will have been checked really carefully. Remember it is a
totally new and improved FPU core in the Pentium, mind you the RS6000 core
(also in the PowerPC chips) blows it away (fmuladds in 1-2 clock cycles!).

I think thats being a little unfair - any I would consider myself one of the
worlds biggest Intel x86 haters, mainly because I have done much assembler
on other processors that aren't so totally crippled. As mentioned above I
think the problem will be fixed as will others. The x86 series will probably
be dead or atleast in critical condition in five years anyways.... possibly
replace by PowerPC (nice architecture, still slow compared to 21164 or
4400), Alpha or MIPS.... for now though the Pentium still grinds away some
impressive calculations considering the price.
