        I presently use Xtree Gold. It has a DoD and 6 pass Wash Disk
        feature for writing over usused areas of a disk/drive. So far I
        have been unsucessfull at recovering any data after Wash Disk
        with Norton Utilities or PC Tools.
        If there is a weakness in Wash Disk I'd like to hear about it.

        I'm not so sure about this on...
