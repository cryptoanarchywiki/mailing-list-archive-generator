[Long list delete. Wow! But notice, he _is_ getting the stuff of the
termial server.]

There is a Pine with PGP support out there. I don't use mail on UNIX, so I
don't have it handy, but I am sure someone else on the list will tell you
all about it.

Same here. I have just been to busy helping people get a better net connection.

How about someone makes up a fill out form that we then send in for
analysis? That's how we did it two years ago.

If you have a SLIP connection, then use that.

Yes, it is TIA, but not on the Mac. TIA runs on the UNIX host only. Your
Mac/PC/Whatever just uses standard SLIP software and doesn't have the
slightest clue that the other end isn't _really_ a SLIP sever. Unlike term,
where you have to recompile the software on the client to work with it. But
please, lets keep the SLIP discussion off the list. Anyone who is
interested please email me for more info.

Happy netting,
