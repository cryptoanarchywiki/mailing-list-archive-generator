I read about some changes that John Perry made to his remailer, since
it is being abused.  (Sorry to hear it!)

I thought he said he is doing source blocking (I deleted the message
and can't check.)  Is this true?  Were there no hops between the
abuser and the remailer?  How can you prevent the abuser from just
chaining through different paths to reach your remailer and continuing
to use it?  Or am I remembering incorrectly ;)

Random Factor suggested (among other things)
> * require encryption for incoming messages.

Requiring encryption is OK, as long as you don't require the remailing
header and message body to be encrypted together.  If you do, like the
extropia remailer does, then you can't form reply blocks that include
such a remailer (since the reply block is created by a sender who
obviously doesn't have the message body that his recipient will use
the reply block to respond to).
