     The ECPA offers two levels of protection to e-mail, transmitted e-mail
and stored e-mail. The some mail on Illuminati (Steve Jackson's BBS) had
been sent but had not been read by the intended recipients. The the first
trial found that the there had been a violation of the ECPA with regard to
the section on stored mail, but not on transmitted mail. It narrowly defined
the transmitted section to include only interception contemporaneous with
transmission with the e-mail. Sine the mail had been sitting around on the
hard disk, the court refused to call it interception.

     If anyone really cannot find a copy of the ECPA I can go search for my
ASCII edition, but right now I only have a hard copy lying around somewhere
on this desk.
