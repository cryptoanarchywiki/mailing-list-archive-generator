The rest expunged because it infuriates me so...

What utter BULLSHIT!!!! (not you Phil, but your treatment by Customs!!)

I hope you are contemplating a little legal action of your own. At the
least this is harassment. I would be curious if Agent Winters was acting
upon his own initiative or whether he was instructed to do this. I suspect
the later.

Chin up, shoulders back, Phil...
