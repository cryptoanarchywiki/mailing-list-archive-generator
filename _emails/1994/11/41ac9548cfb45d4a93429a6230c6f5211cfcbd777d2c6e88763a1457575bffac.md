No, just the things that other people and institutions have NO BUSINESS
KNOWING. I value my privacy. I do not take it for granted. If everyone in
the world used PGP or some other form of strong crypto to protect
confidential information it might start to rebuild our right to privacy
which is being chipped away daily. We do have the right and responsibility
to privacy. Our right is to privacy, our responsibility is to protect it.

You show just how naive you are. The government has long since stopped
representing its citizens. Its sole interest is to perpetuate itself. This
happened when politicians replaced statesmen. The needs of the citizens are
no longer the needs of government. Citizens are just here to pay the bills
and go along with the ride. We have no one to blame but ourselves, we keep
electing the same idiots year after year and never hold them accountable.
We believe what they say, not what they do.

So do I but, if you trust the government, this will vanish too. I prefer to
breathe the fresh air and ensure that my children will be able to do the
same.
