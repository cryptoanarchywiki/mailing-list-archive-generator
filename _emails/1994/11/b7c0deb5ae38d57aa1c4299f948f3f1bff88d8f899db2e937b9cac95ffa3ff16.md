This is just a quick thought...does anyone know what kind of metallic ink
is used?  To add to the conspiracy theory, say the metallic ink is
radioactive with a higher radiation count for higher dollar amounts--would
it be implausible then to have some sort of radiation counter to gauge a
person's total 'radiation count,' and thereby approximate how much currency
they are carrying out of the country?

I wouldn't take the above seriously though....
