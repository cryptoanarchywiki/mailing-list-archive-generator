It's in the Nov. 11 issue of Science, accompanied by a nice Perspectives 
piece that someone with a better appreciation of the math might be able 
to understand.  Hal (or anyone else on the list who is willing to explain 
a little of the math to me, off the list) will get a free lesson in 
Molecular Biology and the polymerase chain reaction in return that should 
explain the physical construction of this  *genetic AlGorethem*   :-)
