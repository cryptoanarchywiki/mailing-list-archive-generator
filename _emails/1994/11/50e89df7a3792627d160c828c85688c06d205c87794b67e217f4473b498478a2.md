Whoopee!

In case there are some cypherpunks not familiar with the situation:


The people who founded public key cryptography took out patents
on various methods, patents that were entirely legitimate and
justified.

All of these various patents got together under a single 
partnership which then made the dubious claim to own
*all* methods of public key cryptography, even methods such
as the square root method which are substantially different
from those developed by the patent holders.

Those who make such a claim deserve to be afflicted
with a plague of locusts and lawyers.
