Existing standards track RFCs support PEM-based security of RFC-822
email (RFC 1421, RFC 1422, RFC 1423, and RFC 1424).

Recent work on security of MIME has allowed for an alternative content
protection and certification mechanism (i.e. PGP). See Internet Drafts
draft-ietf-pem-sigenc-02.txt and draft-ietf-pem-mime-07.txt which 
respectively define the framework and the PEM-specific parts.

The intent of the MIME extensions is to enable either PGP or PEM to be used,
although the standard for the former is I believe still pending. I am
not aware of efforts to integrate the two certification mechanisms.

This is what a PEM-conformant user agent does.

The PEM WG used to call these organisational notaries, but they have been
dropped from the standards. They are also referred to in related work as
Local Registration Agents or Authorities - and are necessary for large
organisations' use of certification services.

This sounds similar to the certification message in RFC 1424. There isn't
a requirement for certificate retrieval as certificates are sent with the
message or handled using (as yet unspecified) directory facilities -
probably an extended DNS in the Internet environment.
