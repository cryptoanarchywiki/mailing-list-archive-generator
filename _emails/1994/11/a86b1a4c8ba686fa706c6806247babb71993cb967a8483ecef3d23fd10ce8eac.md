This worked quite well last time, also considering that many of the
attendees seem to be repeats there is hardly a need to go through the
permutations with  every person present.

I'll be the one wearing the black motorcycle jacket with a painting of
Georgia O'Keefe's "Red White and Blue Cow Skull" on the back. I'll also be
holding drafts of a handbook on intellectual property consideration for
crypto-system developers/users. Don't ask for it until the meeting, it isn't
nearly finished.
