Will the following error (Re Pentium Floating Point Bug     Date: 15 Nov 
1994)
cause problems with PGP key generation or any other normal operations with
PGP or other crypto.  I'm not a math mathmatics nerd but I know we generally 

deal with big numbers.

   For all of you paranoids out there, YES this is a plot by NSA to weeken
our crypto capabilities, this is the only bug that we KNOW about :)

NOTE:  I'm currently not receiving cypherpunks mailing for some reason.  I'm 
not
sure why, so please copy me on your posts.  (Hughes, have you had a chance 
to
look at this?)

     Thanks!
