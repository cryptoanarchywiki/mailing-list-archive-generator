You bothered ?

$ This message contains data in an unrecognized format, image/gif,
$ which can be decoded and written to a file.
$ Please enter the name of a file to which the data should be written,
$ or just press RETURN to skip writing it to a file.

<many unhappy RETURNs later>

Heh, that was irritating. Did I mention that ELM dumps core sometimes when I
"press RETURN to skip writing it to a file" ?  Regular mailbombing would be 
easier to handle.

To answer Amanda's question, IMHO PGP blocks longer than message bodies are
crap only when they come in weird formats that coerce me to press extra keys.
Once I start reading one of these clunkers, I can't even escape to the main
menu until I've stepped through the whole damn thing. Sometimes the parts in
between the "press RETURN"s are longer than a screen, and scroll off into
the ether unread.
