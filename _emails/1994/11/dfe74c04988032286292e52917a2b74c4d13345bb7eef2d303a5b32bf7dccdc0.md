But (except for monitoring messages going into and out of the remailer,
or operator logging) how is anyone to know which remailers were involved
in a chain?  Isn't this one of the things that chaining is supposed to
prevent?  

A more accurate objection might be that if spam/proprietary data is
chained through remailers, then EVERY remailer is at risk.  

BTW, I think your safeguards (which I am _not_ objecting to) only make
it a little bit harder to use your remailer to post stolen code or
whatever.  Someone  could easily break the posts up into pieces and
chain them through your remailer, perhaps through different chains as
well, e.g.:

>::
>Anon-Subject: RC5.ZIP [06/37] {Sources for RSADSI's proprietary cipher}

You could block multiple messages with the same or similar subject
fields, but anyone chaining remailers intelligently would probably not
use a single remailer as the final sending point -- unless they had it
in for that remailer!

Or are you going to block posts from remailers that forward spam to you?
(A cure worse than the disease, IMHO).
