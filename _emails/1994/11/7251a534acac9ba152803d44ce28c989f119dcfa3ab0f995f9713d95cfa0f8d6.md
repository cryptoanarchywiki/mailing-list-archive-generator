Wouldn't work.  Radiation is useless for something like this - how to tell
the difference between X $20 bills, and Y $100 bills? The roentgen/hour
levels would be close enough to make knowing which is which virtually
impossible.  Radiation is mostly good for yes/no type stuff, unless you're
dusting things with particular combinations of very specific isotopes and
sampling for them - in which case you've got a completely different set of
problems.

Seconded.
