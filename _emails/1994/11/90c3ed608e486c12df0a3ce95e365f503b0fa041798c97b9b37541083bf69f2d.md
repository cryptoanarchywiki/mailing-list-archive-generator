This is an excerpt from an Hearing Designation Order adopted by the FCC 20
July 1994 in the case of Freemon vs. AT&T.  For more detail, try the FCC
Web server:

(http://fcc.gov:70/0/Orders/Common_Carrier/orcc4012.txt)

I had not seen it mentioned here:

>4.  The crux of the Freemons' complaint is the allegation that the
>AT&T operator who handled Elehue Freemon's May 30, 1988 call improperly
>interrupted and divulged the contents of his call and thus violated
>Section 705(a) of the Act.  According to Mr. Freemon, AT&T's operator
>listened to their eight-minute conversation and then interrupted to ask
>Lucille Freemon if her son needed medical help.  Mr. Freemon claims that
>he had already refused two offers of assistance by the operator and that
>the operator's subsequent actions were inappropriate.


At the outset, AT&T denies that [1] this ever happened and [2] if it did
happen the FCC has no jurisdiction in this matter.
