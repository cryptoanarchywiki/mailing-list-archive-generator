What do you mean? How does changing the code take away their privacy? Like
an unauthorized "search and seizure"?

Excellent! Maybe a few of them should start subscribing to the Cypherpunks
remailing list to pick up a few more tips on PGP and remailing in general.

The McGill admin has likely screwed up by raising the students consciousness
regarding encryption and privacy issues. A good analogy would be trying to
put out a fire by pouring gasoline on it...

Good luck to them then. PGP messages can be concealed in blocks of ASCII
characters. And as for banning anon mail, how the hell are they going to
do that???? But shutting down all the phone lines leading into the McGill
computers?
