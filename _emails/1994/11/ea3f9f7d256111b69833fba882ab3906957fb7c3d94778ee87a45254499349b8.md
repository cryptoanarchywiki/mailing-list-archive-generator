I disagree here -- I've gotten a couple of jobs where my net reputation
preceded me and was the primary motivator for my getting an interview.  I
was also told at one of them to continue posting as I did because they felt
that their reputation was enhanced by mine.  

And "cannot make money on the net"?  How do you see this?  Much as I hate
the metaphor, I don't make money on the local highways either, but they're
a part of real life.  I use them to do other things to make money.  Neither
are an integral part of the work that I do, but both make it possible for
me to do the work in a fashion that I can handle (I refuse to live in my
office ever again).

Just because the reputations aren't digital yet, nor is the cash, doesn't
mean that the Net isn't real life.  It's as real as nearby I-94.  And a lot
more interesting and complex.
