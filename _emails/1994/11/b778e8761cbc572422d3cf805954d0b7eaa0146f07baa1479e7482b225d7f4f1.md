-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Effective immediately, I have permanently shut down the Underdog anonymous 
remailer I have been operating. I shall simply delete all further mail I
receive for remailing. Please do not send remailer mail to 
lmccarth@ducie.cs.umass.edu. Due to the pressure of a combination of unrelated
circumstances, I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain this
further at present. Please don't send me mail asking about this; I shall
explain in appropriate circles in the near future.

Sincerely,
Lewis McCarthy (lmccarth@cs.umass.edu)
