I feel like Deke Slayton talking for Gus Grissom in _The _Right_Stuff_.

What John's sayin' here is that there's a two article section in the New
York Times about 1) MS Network(tm) and 2) MS's new VP for Global Network
Assimilation, freshly filched by Microsoft from Proctor and Gamble a few
weeks ago.

What John's sayin' here is that he's got a mailbot which'll send you a copy
of both articles if you send him mail with "NET_puf" in the subject line.
Since there's a "bot on the other end of the message, anything in the
message doesn't really matter.

What John's sayin' here is that he's not posting the whole thing to the
list in the interest of bandwidth, and, to prove his heart's in the right
place, he'll keep his pointer to the article as terse as possible.

What John's *not* sayin' here is how much a lot of us appreciate his access
to these articles, cryptic pointers and all.

By the way, I agree with Tim <suprize!>. MicroBorg's nominalistic
imperialism of the english language is starting to gag me. MS Word(tm), MS
Windows(tm), MS Network(tm), indeed.  There oughta be a law..... ;-).


Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
