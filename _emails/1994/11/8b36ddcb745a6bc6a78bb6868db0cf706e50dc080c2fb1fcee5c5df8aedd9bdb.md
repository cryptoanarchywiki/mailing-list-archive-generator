Being a marginal (at best :-) C++ programmer, I snagged a copy of the DLL
skeleton from MS's FTP site. Into that, I started stuffing Pr0duct Cypher's
PGP Tools package. I've gotten it to where it will *mostly* compile, but I'm
still having a couple of problems that I hope someone more skilled than I
can resolve.
Semi-details: I've got a *bunch* (20+) warnings, all about type mismatches
(char:int, etc); and _2_ errors that I can't seem to locate. I've been
chasing down the errors first, but as I said, can't seem to hammer the
little buggers (pun intended :-). If there's another VC++ programmer out
there (I've got 1.5 pro), I'd appreciate it if you could email me so we can
work something out so I can send you a copy of what I've got so far, and see
if you can't spot where the problems are.
I don't *think* there's much left before it'll turn into a .DLL - but then,
if I knew anything about it, I wouldn't be yelling for help :-/
