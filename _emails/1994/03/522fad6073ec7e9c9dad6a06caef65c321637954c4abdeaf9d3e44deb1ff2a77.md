Yep.  But it may be there some day.  Ken Olson called ISDN a joke.
I remember seeing somebody in Computer World saying ISDN stood for

"I Still Don't kNow".

Hah!  We are talking about an IBM board here!! :-)   There was some
kind of ROM on the board, it may be an 8051 with EPROM?  Or possibly
a 68701.  We will figure it out at some point.

Speaking of DSP the new AT&T 3700 modem (from paradyne actually) has
a DSP and it seems to be driven by an easily modifyable rom.  Just another
possibility.


While we are blue skying about this - what about the idea of using two
cellular connections in parallel?  Aside from cost it might create some
interesting interception problems.

I'd like a 250 Mhz 128 bit hybrid processor with 64 meg of 8 way interleaved
memory, a 10 megabyte per second i/o channel, two 3 gig hard disks, two dat
drives with compression, and a large diet coke.
