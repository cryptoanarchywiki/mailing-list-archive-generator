This is not new.  It's been used for years by software companies in
copy-protection schemes.  Ask anyone who's ever "cracked" software. 
Copy-protection systems rely on the fact that someone can not easily
find and remove the algorythm which impedes duplication.  There are
three common ways of preventing this.  First, the code is encrypted in
layers and modules.  Each module decrypts the next layer and rescrambles
or erases the last.  This prevents the attacker from getting an overall
view of the program, as it is never all accessable at once, but it can
be viewed in peices as it executes.  Secondly, several layers of
interpreted code can be used.  Each layer interprets the next.  In this
way, no assembly language code ever exists in plaintext (except the
first level interpreter).  Finally, the program checksums itself to
prevent tampering.  These methods can never provide foolproof
protection, but they can slow down attacks considerably.  Even the most
determined attacks can be delayed for weeks or months.  But if they want
it bad enough, they can probably reverse-engineer it - as has been said
before, crypto is all economics.

I've considered such possibilities for digital cash, but even if the
algorithm could not be derived from the cryptographically protected
software, it really doesn't solve the double-spending problem.  You can
just copy the entire module, along with all the money, and spend it
twice (on seperate victims, of course).
And all those layers of encryption can make it unbearably slow.
