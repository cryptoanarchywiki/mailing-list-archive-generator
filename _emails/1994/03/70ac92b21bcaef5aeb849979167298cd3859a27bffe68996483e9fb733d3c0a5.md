There are things about the impending PGP ban in the Netherlands which
I can't understand.

I lived in Wolfheze, The Netherlands, much of last year.  The Dutch
like to think of themselves as an open, tolerant society.  In many
ways, they are.  Where they are not, they are usually subtle.
This time, they are hardly being subtle.

I don't know what that means.
