Hello,

  I finally wrote some code. This interface automates the wrapping of
messages for use with the encrypted anonymous remailers--provided
you're willing to enter into Emacs for the wrapping.

  I've sent & received several messages using it. Please let me know
if you find any problems.

enjoy,
michael

;;; Any comments or suggestions welcomed.

;;; License

;;; No implied or expressed warranty nor any other guarantee.
;;; Do what you want with this.


;;; Anonymous Encrypted Remailer Interface


;;; Usage:

;;; You must set ar-remailer-list to a list of anonymous
;;; remailer addresses. These must be in a valid mail ``To:''
;;; format. The initial recipients address must also be in a valid
;;; ``To:'' format; addresses depending on alias files will not
;;; work because your mail program (MH, Elm, mail, etc.) will
;;; not get a chance to process them before the message is wrapped.

;;; After writing your message, invoke ar-wrap-message. If you
;;; wish to sign the message, you should only sign the first
;;; wrapping.

;;; After the message has been wrapped, a list will appear in
;;; the minibuffer--this is the route the message will take.

;;; This package requires that you have mailcrypt configured
;;; for use with pgp (unless you send to ripem remailers).


;;; To Do:

;;; Modify mc-encrypt to take a boolean argument for
;;; signing the message.

;;; Allow for different remailer lists based on whether
;;; the transit delay one wants, e.g., fast, normal, or slow.
