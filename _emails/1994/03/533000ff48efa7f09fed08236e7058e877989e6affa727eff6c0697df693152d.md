What if the only biometric scans taken of a person were taken while
flushing on niacin?  Will they result in a consistent, though flushed,
scan, thereby enabling the stystem to identify you anyway?  If they then
nab you and want to verify the scan, all they have to do is inject you with
another dose of niacin and check the scan.  [Obviously this scenario
assumes some fairly major civil rights violations, but for the
international traveler....]
