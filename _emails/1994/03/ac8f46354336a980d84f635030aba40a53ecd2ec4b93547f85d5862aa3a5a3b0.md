I would like to offer up a scenario which I have heard allusions to, but has 
not been concretely spelled out. It is admittedly farfetched, but not out of 
the realm of possibility. Imagine a room full of Cray XMP's running an AI 
program developed ala FinCen, NSA etc. This program can obtain "setup" 
information (because DTII has passed) without need for even a warrant. The 
program detects certain patterns of information transfer (phone, Net, 
whatever) that it deems suspicious. Suspects are then "explored" further. 
What kind of computing power would it take to implement complete survailence
on say, Washington, D.C.?

This system is very similar to how law enforcement agents now patrol the 
nations highways. People fitting a certain profile are detained by the police,
and searched. Has it been determined if such search and seizures are legal?

I recently wrote to NBC to inform them of what the detection of their calling 
patterns (in real time) could mean to the confidentiality of their sources. 
How many people would commit sensitive information to the media knowing that 
they could be easily monitered? It should be constantly pointed out to the 
media that they have a great deal to lose by passage of DTII, Clipper et al.
The information exchange business could easily be coerced by Gov't in the near
future. Just a few ramblings I wanted to get off my chest.
