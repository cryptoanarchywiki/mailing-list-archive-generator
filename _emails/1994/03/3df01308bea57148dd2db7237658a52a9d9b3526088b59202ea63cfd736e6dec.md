C'punks,

For those of you who don't listen to Rush Limbaugh, he just did a couple 
of minutes on the Clipper chip.  He was not favorable.  He specifically 
mentioned that it would be voluntary "for now," to which he added that 
this is always how such things start from the government.

His layman's explanation was that Clipper chip would be put in every 
phone and computer to easily allow the government to tap its 
communications.  He mentioned the Skipjack algorithm in passing, and 
seemed to have a pretty good grasp of Clipper and its implications.

Time for us to target Rush's show with anti-Clipper calls?  His contact 
information is:

		phone	800 282 2882
		fax	212 563 9166
		e-mail	70277.2502@compuserve.com

Radio show hours are noon to 3:00pm EST

 S a n d y
