Not as many as I'd hoped.  And most of them said pretty much the same  
thing:

   pro:  crime would be reduced
   con:  freedom would be eliminated

My primary goal was to generate thought and discussion.  In that  
light, my original post did succeed somewhat.  However, I haven't  
received enough variety in the responses to construct a good list of  
pros.  


I think I should rephrase the question and post again.  I should not  
ask for the pros and cons of a "surveillance state", rather, I should  
ask for the pros and cons of "government sponsored surveillance  
technology/programs".

I want to get people to think about possible benifits of government  
sponsored surveillance.  Not because I like government sponsored  
surveillance, but because I feel that thinking about the technology  
from a "pro" perspective will give the "anti" (or better, the  
"indifferent") people insight into how the pro-surveillance people  
might attempt to justify the programs they advocate.

	battlefield from their chair."

	-- somebody famous probably said something like this
	   2000 years ago
