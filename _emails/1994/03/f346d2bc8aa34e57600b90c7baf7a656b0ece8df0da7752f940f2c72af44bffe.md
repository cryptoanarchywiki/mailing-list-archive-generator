"The security services are said to have warned the Department of Trade
and Industry that they will need to act more publicly if the service
(talking about the Royal Mail - G) is privatised. They also point out
that unlike the privatisation of the telephone network, which left
the British Telecom network intact and easy to tap, the privatisation
of the Royal Mail will lead to independent competitor services, making
the interception of mail much more difficult."
