Well, I know that this might be a bit of a "crazy" idea, but would the
best way to distribute an encrypted mailing list be to have a PGP setup
where there is a public key to the mailing list, and all recipients are
given copies of the secret key?  I know that it might be a bit stupid
from the security side, but if each person was using PGP, the secret key
would be PGP encrypted and sent with that person's public key, ensuring
that only subscribers would get it, and then using that secret key to
decrypt the messages as they are recieved?


Just wonderin'....
