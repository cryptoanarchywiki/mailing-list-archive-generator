[Tim's reply to Jim]
 Citizen-Unit Miller is to be commended for his
 recognition that the common good is served when the state
 fulfills its surveillance obligations.  .... etc.

[Jim's reply]
I do *not* think a surveillance state is a good thing.  I
deliberately constructed my post to get people's attention.  I want
people (other than just Cypherpunks) to think about life in a
surveillance state.

..............................................

Thinking about life in a surveillance state, I wonder what youall would 
do if it came to pass?  I once asked a bunch of Objectivists what they 
would do if a certain individual was elected and the US was turned into 
a socialist/commie paradise.  In three hours of discussion, they could 
not arrive at any viable ideas.

Maybe, Jim, you could also compile some replies about how 'free radical 
units' would deal with the problem.  It might sound a bit like a sci-fi 
story, all total.
