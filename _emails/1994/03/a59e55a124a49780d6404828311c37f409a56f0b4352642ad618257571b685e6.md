     I will be establishing an offshore corporation in the very near
future.  I am currently leaning towards doing so in Hong Kong both
because it raises fewer flags than a Cayman Island corporation and
because I've seen ads in _The Economist_ detailing existing
corporations for sale.

     Can anyone recommend a lawyer experienced in setting up such
organizations who can be trusted to be discrete?  Location (of the
lawyer) is unimportant.  In particular, I need to determine if a
foreign corporation needs to establish a U.S. corp to do business
in the U.S. (consulting work, of course), and I need someone who
can set such things up.

     My apologies if this post is too far off topic for this list.
