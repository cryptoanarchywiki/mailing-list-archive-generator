I'm looking for someone in the DC area who can lend me a Sun audio adaptor
plug for this weekend's meeting. One end has mini-DIN that plugs into the
Sun, and the other has standard microphone and headphone/speaker jacks.

I've got one located on the net, but that will cost FedEx money to get
from and back to its owner. I'd rather spend the money on pizza and beer.

Please get back to me, or Dan Brown (brown@eff.org) if you can help.
Thanks.

Pat
