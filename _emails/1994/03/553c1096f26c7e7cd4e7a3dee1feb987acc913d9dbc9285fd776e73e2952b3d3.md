I got a call this afternoon from Paul Andrews at the Seattle Times, 
wanting to ask me a few questions. After playing phone tag for an hour or 
so, we got connected. 

We discussed cypherpunks, steganography, and clipper. He seemed to have a 
good handle on how scary the clipper (and tessera) recommendations were. 
I was able to supply him with a little more information (contact #s) and 
answer some questions he had. 

His article will be in this sundays' Seattle Times, but it sounds like he 
may be gearing up to write another. In any case, I'm going to keep in 
touch. 

It looks like someone in the downtown area had the big brother inside 
logo on their windows desktop screen and _that_ is what caught his 
attention. I'm glad it served the purpose it was meant for -- catching 
people's attention and making them think.
