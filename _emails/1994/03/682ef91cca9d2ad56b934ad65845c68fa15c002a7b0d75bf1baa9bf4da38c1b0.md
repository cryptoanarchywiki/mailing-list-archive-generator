I think this is very perceptive. Clipper is perhaps the best they could 
_think_ of given an outmoded set of axioms. If the presumptions people in 
government have about their own role are no longer valid, they probably 
don't fully realize it yet, or at least can't admit they do. Clipper is 
just the kind of woefully clueless thing people in that position would come 
up with.

It is kind of scary. Yikes.
