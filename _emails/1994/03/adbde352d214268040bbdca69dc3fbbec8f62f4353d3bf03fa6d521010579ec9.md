For the benefit of those who aren't being petulant, I will repeat:

The existing, already implemented and available, cryptographic
authentication (but not encrypted) version of the new BSD telnet is
available from:

	ftp.cray.com(128.162.15.3):src/telnet/telnet.94.02.07.NE.tar.Z

This is not theoretical code; it really exists. See for yourself. No,
it doesn't just do kerberos.

The proposed telnet encryption and authentication RFCs are available
in the same directory.

The BSD 4.4 domestic distribution already has the encrypted version of
the code in it; perhaps someone should "liberate" it.

Those wishing to run an encrypted telnet to a remote machine that does
not support the new telnet options should ask the remote system
administrator to install the new telnet, which compiles on virtually
every architecture around, including SVR4 (or at least Solaris).
Failing that, you can run your own telnetd on the remote host.

Sorry if suggesting that people use already existing code is being a
"wet blanket".

Perry
