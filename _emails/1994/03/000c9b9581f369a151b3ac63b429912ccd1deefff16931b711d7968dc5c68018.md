This is probably erroneous logic but...

1. Mr Davis of The New Republic sends parts of his
   article via modem.  The article (unencrypted)
   is intercepted by persons unknown.  Mr. Davis
   receives a cryptic (pun intended) call in his
   room about the transmissions.

2. The Clinton Administration wants Clipper to
   facilitate monitoring of communications.

3. The Government would escrow clipper keys.

4. What keeps someone in a high government office
   from misusing these keys?  Especially since
   item 1 is illegal due to antiwiretap laws
   anyway?

I e-mailed a copy of this to Rush...since a
lot more people are excited about Whitewater
than about Clipper, it seems like it might make
a decent tie-in...

Comments?

Regards,

Dave
