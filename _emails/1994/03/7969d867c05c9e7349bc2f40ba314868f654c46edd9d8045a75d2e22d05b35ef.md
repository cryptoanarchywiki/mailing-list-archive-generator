The old tran used the sum of the bytes.

The new tran uses the histogram of the bytes (of the first block -- 8KB or
the whole message).  This carries more information.

That seeds a PRNG (currently subtract-with-borrow, but it could be made
stronger -- e.g., with DES or IDEA encrypting the output before use) which
then drives a pairwise byte swap over each 8KB block of the stream.

This is a self-inverse.

I can send code to anyone interested.  It's also on ripem.msu.edu.
