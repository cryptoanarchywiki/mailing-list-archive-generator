Rather than have the holder and the person to whom the note is being sold
go through a transaction with the issuer, one can have the issuer give his
customers a cryptographically tamperproof software module which will
prevent anonymous double-spending.  This allows the digital cash system to
work "offline" without having to connect to the bank every time two people
wish to conduct a transaction.

If you design the system so that cheating breaks the anonymity and identifies
the perpetrator, then you can simply deter it in the same way we do with 
conventional instruments.  Give the person a horrible credit rating and 
threaten to toss him in jail.
