If this is the one I'm thinking of, with source in basic, the algorithms 
used are mostly primitive things that have been cracked a long time ago.  
while it may be useful as a text for someone who isn't at all familiar 
with cryptography to start with, don't be fooled by claims that simple 
xor is a strong encryption algorithm.  I dont think the book covers any 
serious encryption algorithms (des, idea, public key crypto, etc) but the 
most memorable thing about it was that it was funny that they believed 
what they were saying, so my memory may be faulty.
