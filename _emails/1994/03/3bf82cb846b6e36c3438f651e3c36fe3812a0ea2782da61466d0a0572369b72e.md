know = 100% objective certainty

How can you tell that you've been compromised if you stick to 
non-security-by-obscurity methods?

That would be difficult.  But, lack of objective measures does not mean 
that security-through-obscurity is innefective.  BTW, there may be some 
statistics on the effectiveness of StO, somewhere.  (Anyone out there 
heard of any?)

I am not trying to convince everyone hide their data in the same place I 
am hiding it.  Simply consider hiding it, rather than leaving it out in 
the open!  That's not too crazy a proposition, is it?

Take your encrypted data.  Stick it in a file, using a variable offset.
That's all there is to it.
