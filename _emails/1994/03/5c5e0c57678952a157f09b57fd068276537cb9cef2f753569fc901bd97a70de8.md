I never saw the posting below here, only on sci.crypt.  It seems
relevant to the present discussion.

I did take a look at the source code to stealth pgp; it is quite simple and
nicely done.  However it doesn't do anything special about disguising the
encrypted session key.  It just strips off the two length bytes PGP puts
at the front.  Not only is this revealing, it also doesn't always work.
Apparently the program can't always reconstruct the original mpi length
if the encrypted key's size happens to be much less than the modulus.
It does print a warning in that case that the file won't be able to be
de-stealth'd successfully.

Stealth PGP is a nice start but it needs to be improved to be truly stealthy.

> One other concern is that stealth has to create a temporary file when
> reading in data to attach headers, and depending on the build options
> chosen the program will store it in either $PGPPATH, the current directory
> or /tmp. On Unix machines, the file will be deleted as soon as it is opened,
> making it difficult to capture, but on other operating systems the file
> will only be deleted when it has been used. (In either case the file will
> be zeroed before being closed).

> In addition, some operating systems will use temporary files on your disk
