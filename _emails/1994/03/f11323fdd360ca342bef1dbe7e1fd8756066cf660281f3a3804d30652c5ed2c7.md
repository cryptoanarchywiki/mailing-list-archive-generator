It is obvious to me that many people in the government wish to turn  
the US into a surveillance state.  What wrong with that?  Seems like  
a lot of good could come from it.



Now that I have you're attention...

E-mail me your reasons why a surveillance state is a good thing or a  
bad thing.  I will summarize both the pros and cons and repost them  
to the list.
