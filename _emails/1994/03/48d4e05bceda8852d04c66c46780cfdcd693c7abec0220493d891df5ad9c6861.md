	Wouldn't doing something like this be like distributing shareware on a 
CD-Rom? Most of the Rom's I've seen have programs and the like, but a few have 
had source code, papers, hypercard stacks, etc. that were all copyrighted but 
still pushed out on the Rom.

	I think the only problem would be if you were charging more money than 
a "reasonable duplication fee". Most people will agree that this would be the 
cost of the media and maybe a little something for your time.

	Just another of my 0.02...

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of phone
calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
