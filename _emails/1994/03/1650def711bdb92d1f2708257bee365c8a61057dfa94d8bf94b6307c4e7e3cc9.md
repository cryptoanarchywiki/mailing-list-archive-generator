Phil is wrong and ys you can strengthen DES by choosing completely
independent subkeys, rather than generating the subkeys with known
algorithm from 56-bit "seed".

However, the additional strength will mostly go towards foiling
brute-force attacks.

Note, that it will take about 2^60 chosen plaintexts instead
of 2^47 to mount differential cryptanalysis attack, and also
linear cryptanalysis is somewhat hampered by using subkeys
independently generated.

Wrong. Pure hardware requirements - nothing so subtle as to
"complicate" software implementation, simply peculiarity of
that day hardware... Trust me! (:-)
