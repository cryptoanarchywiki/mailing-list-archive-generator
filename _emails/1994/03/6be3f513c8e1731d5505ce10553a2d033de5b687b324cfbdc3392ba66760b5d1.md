I agree.  When I wrote that I was ``incensed'', I meant in the sense of
``excited'', not ``angry''.  I genuinely want to question him (not
``jump on him'') in an effort to better understand how he justifies to
himself opinions that you and I find so offensive.  This may provide
even more incriminating revelations for dissemination.

Yep!
