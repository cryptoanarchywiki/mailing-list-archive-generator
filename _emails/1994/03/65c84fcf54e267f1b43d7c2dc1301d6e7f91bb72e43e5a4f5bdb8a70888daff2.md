The problem, from what I can tell, is that one of the mail routing
machines at uunet in Virginia was down.  For various political reasons
having to do with AUP's, toad.com routes NSFNet mail through uunet.
So one of the relay machines went down, and some messages were delayed.

Mail queuing makes no effort at all to preserve ordering, so if some
message doesn't go straight to the machine it's supposed to the first
time, ordering can get pretty randomly scrambled.

I took five penet addresses off the list.  Those people who were on it
from that site can add themselves back on with majordomo.
