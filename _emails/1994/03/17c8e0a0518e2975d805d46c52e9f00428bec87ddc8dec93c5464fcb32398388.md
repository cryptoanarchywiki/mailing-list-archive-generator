Please don't do that.  I don't want to go through hoops to read this
mailing list.  It's already cumbersome as is.  Adding PGP in the soup
would make things very nasty.  I'd rather not use PGP except for private
messages.

Perhaps having a usenet news group for encoded mail might be better.
Something where everyone can occasionally either send a PGP'ed message
with the subject being an encoded version of the receipient's name,
or with just random junk that's PGP'ed...  This would create enough
traffic to be able to hide messages in.

Perhaps a special "news" reader program can be written that scans
all messages in that group for the encoded name, and if it matches
that of the reader it will decode it and dump it in that user's mail
or read it (and possibly reply to it) on the spot.
