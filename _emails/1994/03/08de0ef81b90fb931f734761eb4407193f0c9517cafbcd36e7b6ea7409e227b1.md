	Just a thought on ways to deter all of this multiple spending 
gunk - when you start off, have a centralized bank server. While traffic 
is low, you can have each individual certificate cleared with the bank 
server upon creation and execution. After that, things start getting 
tricky. Maybe a network of bank servers linked by high priority internet 
links (i don't suppose there really is such a thing, but this is 
dreamland, after all). This would mean that to cash a certificate more 
than once would require very fast and accurate timing, and if you combine 
this with a fairly low upper limit for certificate value, it becomes a 
waste of time try.
	Oh well. Just my A$0.02.
