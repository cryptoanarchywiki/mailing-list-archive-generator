You miss the point, Eric. We are advocating that IN THE FUTURE all
communications should be encrypted. However, FOR THE MOMENT this is
often impractical. Cypherpunks write code in an effort to try to bring
this future closer. However, making our lives impossible right now
will delay that future.

I encrypt things whenever possible. Some people I communicate with
can't encrypt, so I adjust, on a case by case basis. Someday,
hopefully within the next year or two, things will be different.

Encrypting this list ever would be useless -- but fine if it would
be easy to do. Since it isn't easy or useful, it is a bad idea.
