Everyone's talking about encrypted telnet. Has anyone at least READ the
Kerberos FAQ? It's been in use for a while, and, to quote...

> Kerberos is a network authentication system for use on physically
> insecure networks, based on the key distribution model presented by
> Needham and Schroeder.[3] It allows entities communicating over
> networks to prove their identity to each other while preventing
> eavsdropping or replay attacks.  It also provides for data stream
> integrity (detection of modification) and secrecy (preventing
> unauthorized reading) using cryptography systems such as DES.

> Practically speaking, Kerberos is mostly used in application-level
> protocols (ISO model level 7), such as TELNET or FTP, to provide user
> to host security.  It is also used, though less frequently, as the

Being more 'official' than PGP, only a totally export-safe version has
got out to ftp.funet.fi.  Of course, it could be possible to patch PGP or
something else into Bones, as the non-encrypting Kerberos is called.
