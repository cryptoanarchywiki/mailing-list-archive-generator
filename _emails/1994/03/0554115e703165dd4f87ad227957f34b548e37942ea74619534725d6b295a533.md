> 1) ripem is illegal for non-north-american users
Well, export of RIPEM is illegal. Then again, export of PGP is 
illegal. The difference is that PGP has already been exported
and distributed/improved outside of North America.

> 2) ripem still uses DES
RIPEM has supported triple DES since version 1.1 (I'm the person
who added triple DES support to RIPEM).

> 3) using ripem supports the notion that PKP holds some valid patents

As a practical matter, I am willing to use what the person on the 
other end of the connection is using. 

Some people won't/can't use PGP because they don't want to pay (and are
worried about the legal issues, IDEA/RSA patents).

Some people won't/can't use RIPEM because they are outside of North 
America, have a religious axe to grind about software patents, or 
believe that RIPEM is part of an NSA plot to take over the planet. 

So, I'll sign with PGP. Why? More people on cypherpunks use it.
