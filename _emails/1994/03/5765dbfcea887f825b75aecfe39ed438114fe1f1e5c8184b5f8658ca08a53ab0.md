I just want to warn anyone who is thinking of trying this that 400 mg
is not the place to start with niacin.  The flushing will be extremely
intense at that level and you will probably either think you are dying
or wish you were.  Try 50 or 100 mg to start with.

You do build up a tolerance to this effect of niacin pretty fast so
experienced users will need higher doses to get the flushing.  But for
a non-user lower doses are adequate.
