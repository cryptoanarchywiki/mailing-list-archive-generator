   Make sure the drapes block IR.  There are instances of even local
   police forces flooding the front of a house with IR light, and
   viewing the activities inside with IR viewers -- all of this
   through closed drapes.

Or you could just put a nice incandescent light fixture between you and the
drapes; nice IR output from those bulbs. Halogen fixtures ought to work
also, but fluorescent bulbs don't produce enough IR.

More importantly: attach a contact-speaker to each pane of glass, and feed
Top 40 radio to it. There have been reported cases of spy types bouncing
laser beams off windows and using the reflected beams to reproduce the
vibrations produced in the glass by reflected sound; in other words, the
window panes are large membranes which vibrate in sync with the sound that
hits them, so you want to override those vibrations with something else.

This reeks of paranoia, eh?
