The Act does exempt carriers from providing backdoors in the encrytion
it *doesn't* provide; it makes no mention of any exemption or obligation for
*manufacturers.* Here's an excerpt:

> (5) 'intercept' shall have the same meaning as set forth in
> subsection 2510(4) of title 18, United States Code, except that with
> regard to a common carrier's transmission of a communication encrypted by

Manufacturers are obliged to make available equipment to the common 
carriers "compliant with ... this Act." Even if manufacturers are not (like 
AT&T) also common carriers. The Act does not elaborate on the manufacturers 
role in producing "compliant" equipment, nor on their responsiblities towards
the "provisions of this Act." An interpretation could be that ALL EQUIPMENT
must facilitate the decryption of plaintext under court order. After all, the
Act does require common carriers to provide backdoors in any ecnryption they
provide.

>  "(d) Cooperation of support service providers and equipment
> manufacturers. Common carriers shall consult, as necessary, in a timely
> fashion with appropriate providers of common carrier support services and
> telecommunications equipment manufacturers for the purpose of identifying
> any services or equipment, including hardware and software, that may
