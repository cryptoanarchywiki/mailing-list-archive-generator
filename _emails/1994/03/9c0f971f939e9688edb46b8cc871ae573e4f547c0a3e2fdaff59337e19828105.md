The problem I see with this is that there is no connection between a black holes
mass and surface area (it doesn't have one). In reference to the 'A' in the    
above, is it the event horizon? A funny thing about black holes is that as the
mass increases the event horizon gets larger not smaller (ie gravitational
contraction).
