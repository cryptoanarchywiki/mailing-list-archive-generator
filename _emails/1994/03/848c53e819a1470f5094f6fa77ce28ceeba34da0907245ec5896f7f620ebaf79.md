OOPS!  I goofed!  Sorry about that, hope nobody tried that high a dose..

I started taking some extra vitamins a while back, and the Niacin dose was
150mg, which gave me a barely noticable tingling sensation in my face, but
did not cause my face to change color.  I was previously taking only
Theragran-M.
