Ah, yes.  The man in the middle again.  If a protocol existed that
could guarantee detection of the man in the middle, then it would only
need be used once with each conversant to exchange public keys reliably.
The whole problem of public key distribution would then be solved.

As many of you know, I believe such a protocol exists.  :-)

Without this detection capability in some form, public key has few
advantages except that you only need one of them.  A signfigant
advantage, I admit but it doesn't seem to solve anything.  Exchanging
keys between point A and point B requires a chain of trust with no
possibility of a man in the middle, not the sort of thing people want
to mess with.


Peace,

Bob
