While browsing pgp.c, I noticed it checks for several kinds of compression:

static char *compressSig[] =  { "PK\03\04", "ZOO ", "GIF8", "\352\140",
	"HPAK", "\037\213", "\037\235", "\032\013", "\032HP%"
	/* lharc is special, must be last */ };
static char *compressName[] = { "PKZIP",   "Zoo",  "GIF",  "Arj",
	"Hpack", "gzip", "compressed", "PAK", "Hyper",
	"LHarc" };
static char *compressExt[] =  { ".zip",  ".zoo",  ".gif",  ".arj",
	".hpk", ".z", ".Z", ".pak", ".hyp",
	".lzh" };

Since gzip now uses ".gz" consistently, perhaps the ".z" should change for
PGP 2.5 (or whatever the next public version will be called).

I think the code would have to change more to do the right thing with
both, since it uses the compressSig to decide which compressExt to try --
is this right?  I guess it'd be cleaner to accept both, but probably
not worth extra code that would eventually become obsolete.
