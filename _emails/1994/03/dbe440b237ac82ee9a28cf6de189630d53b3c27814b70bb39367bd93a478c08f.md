Present resolutions? What directions do you think it needs to go? Stego
handles 24 bit TrueColor (actually 32 bit, but Romana wisely decided not to
stuff data in the almost always blank alpha channel), and as many DPI as
you have memory for. I don't think there is much call for deeper color
resolution.

It's true that GIF only accepts 8-bit color and the defacto standard
internet transmision format for higher resolutions JPEG is a lossy
compression that annhilates the message. Is this what you are refering to?

Yes, it is recommended that noisy images are used as the message envelope.
Scanned or Frame-grabbed are good for this kind of thing.
