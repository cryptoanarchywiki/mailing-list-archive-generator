Forgive the somewhat commercial nature of this message, but I think 
it is well within the lines of the cypherpunks mission of getting 
code out to people.

I'm considering the possibility of producing a CD (for distribution 
in North America only) of crypto source code, information/papers and 
binaries for common platforms.

It would include the software available from the common ftp archives 
(soda.berkeley.edu, wimsey.bc.ca, ripem.msu.edu, ftp.dsi.unimi.it 
&c.) plus other assorted tidbits I've collected over the last few 
years. The cost would be somewhere around US$50 depending upon the 
demand (more CDs pressed translates into a lower price; there would
be some equipment costs to offset). 

The CD doesn't exist yet; I'm just considering the possibility of 
putting this together. 

So, would anyone be interested in such a CD?
