Nope...  PGP encrypts the message with a random IDEA key, and then
encrypts the IDEA key with RSA.  You'd have to guess which IDEA key was
used, and encrypt that with RSA.  The SS couldn't guess 2^128 possible
IDEA keys in a hundred years, even with 10 cray supercomputers...  (of
course, they might be able to do it a hundred years from now... but by
then nobody would care about some stupid 20th century email message.)

Karl Barrus's latent-num and truncate-line features on his former
tree-remailer handled all of the traffic-analysis problems rather
nicely, however...

JPP's remailer does this, except it only posts to alt.test.  Maybe you
could convince him to allow it to also forward to remailers when a
remailer public key is specified... :)
