This is a few days late, but in a going through the stack of items
I picked up at the FOSE show in Washington, DC, last week,
I found a 3 inch by 5 inch yellow flyer with the following message:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
      STOP
THE CLIPPER CHIP!

For more info    Before it's too late:
     [ fist with two lightning bolts ]

           CYBER
          RIGHTS
           NOW!

Someone was busy with a copy machine.  The FOSE show was a particularly
good choice -- the vast majority of attendees were government employees,
presumably the ones most likely to be using Clipper.
