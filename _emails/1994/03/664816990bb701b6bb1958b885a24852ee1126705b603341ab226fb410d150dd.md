On a 486DX/33 an RSA sign operation takes a little under 2 seconds 
with a 1024 bit key. With an 1800 bit key (not quite 2048), a little 
under 9 seconds. (gcc 2.5.8, gmp 1.3.2, Linux) 

Personally, I think 1024 bit keys are probably enough.

I'm currently working on some Montgomery multiplication code for 
RSAREF (sans gmp), which should make things faster. (It already 
works, I just need to clean some things up before releasing it).
