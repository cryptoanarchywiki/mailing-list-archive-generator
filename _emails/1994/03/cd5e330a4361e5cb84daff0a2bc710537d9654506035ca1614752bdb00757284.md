NTIA RELEASES NOTICE OF INQUIRY ON PRIVACY ISSUES
TECHNICAL NEWS ADVISORY

     The National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA) is undertaking a comprehensive review
of privacy issues relating to private sector use of
telecommunications-related personal information associated
with the National Information Infrastructure (NII).

     Public comment is requested on issues relevant to such
a review.  After analyzing the comments, NTIA will issue a
report and make recommendations as needed.

     The inquiry will focus on potential uses of personal
information generated by electronic communications,
including interactive multimedia, cable television and
telephony.  NTIA is studying the issues that arise when such
telecommunications-related information is used to create
detailed dossiers about individuals.  NTIA seeks to
determine whether any overarching privacy principles can be
developed that would apply to all firms in the
telecommunications sector.  In addition, NTIA is
soliciting comment on other countries' actions to ensure the
privacy of information transmitted over telecommunications
networks, and to ascertain how any U.S. policies in this
area will affect the international arena.

     The Notice of Inquiry and Request for Comments will
appear in Part IX of the February 11, 1994, Federal Register
and will also be available on the NTIA Bulletin Board at
(202) 482-1199.

Set communications parameters to no parity, 8 data bits and
1 stop.  Comments should be filed on or before March 14,
1994.

     If you have further questions, please contact Carol E.
Mattey or Lisa I. Leidig at the Office of Policy Analysis
and Development, NTIA, 202-482-1880.
