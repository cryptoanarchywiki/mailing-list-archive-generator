I enjoyed Tim May's post.  I'm hoping you all realize my post was  
simply an electronic stick jabbed into the hornet's nest.

I do *not* think a surveillance state is a good thing.  I  
deliberately constructed my post to get people's attention.  I want  
people (other than just Cypherpunks) to think about life in a  
surveillance state.

One goal of mine is to construct a list of all the seemly positive  
aspects of surveillance technology.  I don't think the US will  
suddenly become a total surveillance state overnight.  I do fear the  
US is evolving into one.  Each "positive" use of surveillance  
technology may become accepted for one reason or another, because, by  
individually, they may not seem too harmful.  However, the cumulative  
effect of the incorporation of all these "positive" uses of  
surveillance will transform the US (or any country) into a awful  
place to live.

It may be easier to persuade people not to support government  
sponsored/controlled surveillance technology if all the "positive"  
uses are described together, rather than individually.  Then again,  
maybe not.  I can at least try.
