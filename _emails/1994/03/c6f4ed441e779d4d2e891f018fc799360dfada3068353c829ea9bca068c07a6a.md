>1) Kerberos *does* work between corporate entities.

In practice, no, it doesn't.  This is not a technical problem,
but it's nevertheless quite real.  You will never see inter-realm
Kerberos set up at places line netcom, because netcom's sysadmins
have better things to do than manage secret keys for every
organization that wants to connect.  Only a system with completely
automated configuration and operation has a chance.

Yes, of course, if the A<->B link is encrypted then subsequent logins
are secure.  The point is to find a way to secure those logins *without*
full encryption of the A<->B link.

In practice, almost all of the time, it will.

Personally I agree with this.  Most sysadmins will not.

I'll check this out, but if it's based on Kerberos it's probably
useless for the reasons mentioned above.
