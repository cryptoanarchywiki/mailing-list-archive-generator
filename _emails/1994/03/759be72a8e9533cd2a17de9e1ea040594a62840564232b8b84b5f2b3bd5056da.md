I just noticed in the March 14, 1994 issue of Forbes magazine that 
there is a small
blurb about Clipper/Skipjack.

From page 26 "HIGH-TECH SNOOPS"

"The Administration is about to browbeat American computer 
manufacturers (as well as cable and telephone operators) into 
installing in its machines a special chip that would enable the 
government to eavesdrop on all computer and telephonic transmissions."

It goes on to somewhat describe the governments theory on why they need 
to do this. Then the article says the following.

"This is a really dumb idea. High-tech exports will be devestated. 
Foreigners aren't going to buy equipment with such a decoding device. 
More to the point, criminals and terrorists won't either."

"The Clinton Administration promises that the enormous power that the 
Clipper Chip gives the feds will not lead to abuses of our privacy. Baloney."


This is not a full reproduction of the article but covers the main 
direction of it. All quotes are fully intact and not paraphrased.
