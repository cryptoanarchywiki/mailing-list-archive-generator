Not necessarily - they may be able to claim there's a criminal 
investigation in progress (one of the standard FOIA loopholes)
or they may lose the first round if there isn't one in progress
so they'd have to go start investigating somebody (for corruption
in government, or spies in the CIA, if nothing else is available :-)
Since they don't know who the spy is, or who has which phone,
everybody's key must obviously be relevant evidence...

But it's clearly a fun opportunity.

If the President supports it, why not a bunch of his fellow politicians?
