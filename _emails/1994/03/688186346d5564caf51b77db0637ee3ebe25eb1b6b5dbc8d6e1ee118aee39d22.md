This goes along one of the more cute ways of annoying any snooper on your 
lines.  If you periodically send noise over a suspicious line, you will 
give the people who are trying to monitor you a great headache.  This is 
one of the tactics that you can use to foil any attempts to crack your 
communications.  Then again, wouldn't it be weird if the noise you sent 
over actually decrypted into something intelligible?  This says something 
about 'noise'.  I know that it takes an incredible amount of mathematics 
to prove, but there must be a way to separate what is truly random noise, 
from that which appears to be.  The calculations to crack this are 
probably more expensive than the information it contains, so it is hence 
uneconomical.  But still, it makes me wonder.
