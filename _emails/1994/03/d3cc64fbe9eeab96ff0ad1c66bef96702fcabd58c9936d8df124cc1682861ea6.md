Yes, there would be a benefit for those who are working specifically
on mailers, but for those, like me, of course, who aren't, it would be
a royal pain in the ass.  This is an argument against the practice of
encrypting all traffic, not the principle.  And this argument only
holds in the present time; it won't hold in the future.

As Perry points out, we aren't where we want to be.  Yet.
