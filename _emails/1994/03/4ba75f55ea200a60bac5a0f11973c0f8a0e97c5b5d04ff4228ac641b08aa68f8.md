Here's an idea to piss them off....  How about pulling down your shades,
and on the inside of the shades, we paste big letter made from aluminum foil
that say "Big Brother Go Home" or some such letting'em know that you know
they're there...

BTW: What's the FBI, Cops, etc. supposed to do when their "suspect" is
aware that they're being watched?  Do they knock down your door and
stop you from attempting to foil their investigation because they have
a warrant??  Or do they just go home with their tails between their legs?
