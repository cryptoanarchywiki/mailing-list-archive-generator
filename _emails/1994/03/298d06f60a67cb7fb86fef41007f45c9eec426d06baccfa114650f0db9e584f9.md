For it to de facto preempt honest alternatives.  I'm afraid that the NII
will be funded in part by taxation.  An honest person cannot in good
conscience willfully accept services funded by taxation when he has a
reasonable alternative.  The NII threatens the viability of honest
alternatives.  The reason is that even an honest person will find it
hard to justify paying more for access to a user-funded network when a
cheaper alternative such as NII is available because it is sustained by
expropriating the fruit of the toil of unconsenting others.

Some of us would prefer that relations among people be by mutual consent
or not at all.  Government programs, by contrast, imply imposition by
the politically victorious upon all others.

One can _not_ of course not worry about the cost.  The people who
install and maintain the system have to eat, too.  The pertinent
question is whether that money is given freely in exchange for service
rendered, or is expropriated from another without his consent through
taxation.  An honest user of the system suffers ongoing distress to know
that he benefits only because of another's oppression.

The NII should not come to be.  The ``N'' in NII stands for
``National''.  Nations are abominations, functioning as they do to
supplant personal choice with collective dictate.
