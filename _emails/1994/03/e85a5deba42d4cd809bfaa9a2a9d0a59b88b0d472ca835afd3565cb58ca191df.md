But the Court has upheld various police-power suppressions of
advertising material, etc., even after Brandenburg (1969, right?) under
the "commercial speech" exception, like Pittsburgh Press v Human
Relations Comm.  413 U.S. 376 (1973). [Glommed from my 1979 Con Law
textbook.]

This is a doctrine that commercial expression is less Constitutionally
protected than political and literary expression for historical and
public policy reasons.

I don't know what the present state of the commercial speech exception
is, but it has definitely been a nasty stain on First Amendment jurisprudence
since Valentine v Chrestensen in 1942.
