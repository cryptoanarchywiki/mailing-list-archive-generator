He is quoted in the March issue of Scientific American as saying ``You
can't have absolute privacy.  A democracy just can't operate that way.''
(page 101)  The article goes on to say

	The question is not whether cyberspace will be subjected to
	legislation but rather ``how and when law and order will be
	imposed,'' Parker says.  He predicts that the current state of
	affairs will get much worse before the government steps in ``to
	assure privacy and to protect the rights people do have.''

I was so incensed that I began writing him a letter questioning this.  I
might have carried through, but I couldn't find an email address for him
right away.  (Anyone have it handy?)  His attitude reminds me of claims
by DERD & Co. (love that new designator! what does the R stand for?)
that ``if you knew what I know, you too would favor government
surveillance''.

You write almost as if you are surprised that he in particular would
express these positions.  I was unaware of his existence before reading
this Scientific American piece, so I had no preconceived notions.  Why
were you surprised?
