This message is in response to the person who implied that the "Super Bills" 
were created by the US government as a device to get Clipper implemented.  
I just thought I should put things in perspective.  I refuse to beleive the US
government would do such a thing for several reasons. 
1) I still have some faith in the governments intentions.
2) Do you really think Clipper is that important?  I mean I don't exactly think
Clipper is the governments top priority.  We are trillions of dollars in debt,
our economy sucks, health care is being reformed.  Be realistic.
3) With our economy showing signs of growth(little growth but its there) why 
would we commit economic suicide making the dollar fall more?
Anyway that is my $.03
