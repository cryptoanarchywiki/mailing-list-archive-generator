I think that these proposals would still be coming from the government
if Bush had been re-elected, but that they would generate more opposition,
which would, to me, be a Good Thing.

It is an unfortunate fact that in this country, people often react
differently to an idea, depending on who produces it. I have spoken
to people who really TRUST Clinton, and who have no objection to clipper
and the wiretap bill, until you remind them the the Republicans could
be in office again someday. Then they go "Oh, yeah. That would be a
problem"

There is also the partisan issue. It would be much easier to muster
opposition in Congress if the majority party was not the same as the
party of the administration.
