A while back, when people were starting to talk about encrypting the
list, someone like Eric Hughes pointed out that, if you *want*
to run an encrypted, or batch-digested, or whatever, version of
cypherpunks, you were free to do so - just set up your system
and have it forward cypherpunks to your subscribers.

Somebody could still do it now (not me! :-), preferably outside the
US where the problems of RSA/PKP patents don't apply.
The flip side of the problem is building an automagic decryptor
for mail sent *to* cypherpunks, though you could accomplish part
of that by using the extropia anonymous remailer which accepts
encrypted mail.  

On the other hand, doing either of these functions on toad.com today
risks subjecting John and friends to harassment from RSA
(unless toad.com happens to be a Sun 486i or really  hot box with
SoftPC that can emulate Intel code fast enough to run ViaCrypt.)
