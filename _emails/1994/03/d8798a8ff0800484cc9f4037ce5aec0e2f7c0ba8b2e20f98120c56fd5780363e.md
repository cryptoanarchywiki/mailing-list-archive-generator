I've got access to a zippy, 9-processor, mostly unused box. What ever 
should I _do_ with it? 

Factoring routines? What? I'm looking for a decent project to work on 
this next quarter, and I'd like to include this big boys' muscle. 

Any computations that can be done in parallel are game; I just can't 
think of anything. Any comments appreciated.
