I don't want to stop the fun Jason Zions and Arsen Ray A. are having, but
their ideas won't work. Not that I think IR surveillance is the
highest priority to worry about, either.

But I used to be a physicist, and some of the reasoning here is
perpetuating fallacies:

Nope. Incandescent bulbs will have a broad spectrum of IR, from the
near IR to the far IR. An attacker with a IR illumination system (such
as in night-vison or FLIR systems, etc.) can illuminate in a chosen
spectral range with a power level much higher in his chosen band than
any reasonable bulb will put out. Moreover, he could of course
modulate (e.g.. chop) the illumination and lock-on only to the
modulated signal. In other words, the attacker has the choice of
wavelength and signal modulation to increase his S/N.

Still not likely, except for determined attackers and targets of high
economic or strategic value. I suspect the Waco compound was under IR
and microwave surveillance, for example. I suspect I am not, and in
any case, I don't worry about it.

(The real danger is not individual targetted surveillance, but
widespread and easy surveillance of communications and tracking of
locations, purchases, habits, etc.)

Still won't work well against determined attackers. The entropy of
English speech and the _localization_ of the speaker means several
things:

- multiple windows (or other vibrating conductors, if microwaves are
used) will have a correlated signal corresponding to the speaker,
whereas the added noise will be uncorrelated (generally...one can
imagine clever hacks to try to spoof the listeners by injecting some
correlation into the noise, but this is also detectable....you see the
point, I hope)

- speech models allow phonemes, words, etc., to be plucked out of even
noisy environments (we do it all the time....so do folks listening for
the characteristic signatures of submarines, etc.)

Which is why we'll eventually all plan our conspiracies with
non-speech, non-in-person methods, such as with secure telecom....

Wait! Do you think that's what Clipper and Digital Telephony are all about?
