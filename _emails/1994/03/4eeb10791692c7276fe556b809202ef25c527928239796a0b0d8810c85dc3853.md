[cribbed from a pair of press releases]

House Subcommittee on Science Hearing on Internet Security
Chaired by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-VA)

March 22, 1994

9:30 a.m. - 2318 Rayburn House Office Building

The Subcommittee's interest in the issue arises in part because the
Internet is a prime method of communication between researchers in academia
and industry.  It is also a major means of communication for federal
researchers at agencies under the Subcommittee's jurisdiction.

Recent break-ins on the Internet prompted the federal Computer Emergency
Response Team to issue a special alert to Internet users on February 3, and
suggest that the system may be more vulnerable than generally acknowledged
to deliberate destruction or alteration of computer files.  The hearing
will evaluate the status of security on the Internet today and will
examine measures currently available to enhance security, assess the
effectiveness and degree of implementation of such measures, and identify
obstacles to enhancing Internet security.

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
