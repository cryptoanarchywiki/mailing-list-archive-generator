On a related note.

There's a program called term which is popular in the Linux community.

from the latest term version announcement:
(For those that don't know: Term is a user level slip replacement. It
ISN'T slip, but achieves much of the functionality. Error correction,
compression, and multiplexing across a serial line are all supported,
enabling X windows across a serial line and such.. }

Now, term already allows compression across the line (yes it has 
features for dealing with lines which can't handle certain 
characters). You can have several sessions going, file transfers and 
even X clients.  

I believe that it wouldn't take too much work to add DH key exchange 
and IDEA or triple DES? (GNU GMP might be a good place to look
for the multiple precision math, but there are lots of choices). Am
I going to do it? Well, not this week. 

If anyone has time to work on this, the term source is available by 
anon ftp from ftp tartarus.uwa.edu.au in /pub/oreillym/term. Last 
time I looked term would run on many popular Unix (or Unix-like) 
systems.
