Sorry to have to bring this up, but...

As some of the newbies have pointed out, in previous messages on this thread:
The length field, or any standard-length header scattered (standardly :) 
through the beginning of the file will cost one no loss in security if it 
is encrypted.

The encryption could easily be standardized via a public-key based 
algorithm like PGP.

The stego-program could be kept simple by meerly having it call PGP to do 
the header-encryption work.
