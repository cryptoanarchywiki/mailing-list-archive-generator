I'd rather have people playing with it and complaining about it, than
ignoring it. I'd about given up hope that anyone would do anything with
the program. Someone please set up an emailable server!

I was lazy. To do this properly, you would have to have the ability to
include a message along with the coins, and encrypt it with someone's
PGP key, then decrypt it and display it at the receiving end and separate
the message from the coins. You would about have to rewrite PGP within the
Magic Money client. I could have written a perfect digital cash system,
in which case I'd still be designing it and no code would have been written
at all yet. But I was lazy.

Yes, it assumes you are going to feed it the message in the same format
it was output in. A bank message is signed and encrypted, while a coins.dat
is a raw binary file. User-to-user communication is left up to the users.

Ummm, true. What should I do about this? I wanted Magic Money messages to
look just like any other PGP messages, to avoid the possibility of people
using the program being singled out. Doing what you suggest would require
the server having the ability to encrypt with someone else's public key,
unless the bank uses PGP to encrypt a coins.dat file.

If you were using multiple banks, that would be a problem. So far there
aren't any banks at all, so... but a future version could have the bank's
key id in front of a coin file. Then you would have multiple bank public
keys in bank.pub, and multiple coin files, and multiple elists. And you 
would have to know what bank the person you're doing business with uses, 
so you could send him the proper coins...the complexity grows exponentially.

This is easy to include, and I considered doing it, but it is dangerous.
It would be easy to put coins back into allcoins.dat and then forget and
send them out, thus double-spending. If you take coins out and then want
to put them back, you can always exchange them with the bank yourself.

Where are these bugs? Are they still present in the latest version?
I'd like to get rid of them - what did you change? Error handling is a
bitch - in most cases, I just didn't know of a good way to handle an error.
What do you do if a signature fails, or a coin is not in the proto-file?
Ignore the coin and go on? Then you have the wrong amount of money.

Should it use an incrementing name: coins.000,001,etc. so no files will be
lost? This would be an easy change to make.

Yeah, a mode byte at the beginning so later versions could be downward
compatible with the earlier ones. The coins do have an identifier byte
before each coin type. Later versions could use different bytes.

Since the keys are only used for digicash purposes - why?
See my complaint above about how these changes would require a whole PGP
inside the Magic Money client. I can only write so much code.

Ahem...this I will take issue with. Magic Money (and PGP Tools in general)
uses an MD5-based random number generator which works as follows: the
program takes some input random data and cyclically XOR's it through a
buffer, whose size is determined at compile time. At present, it is set
to 256 bytes. Then, for each 16 bytes of random data requested, the program
takes the MD5 of: the time, a counter, and the 256-byte buffer. Now, if an
attacker does not know the contents of the seed file, knowledge of the time
and the counter value gets him nothing. The fact that the file does not
change is irrelevant, because the non-reversibility of MD5 prevents the
attacker from finding out anything about the file.

Yeah, true. For serious use (real money) you would want either an encrypted
filesystem (I use SecureDrive) or a passphrase on your allcoins.dat file
and the secret key. The server's secret key, which is the most valuable
of all, can't be encrypted because the server has to be able to read it
without a user present.

Is his server e-mailable? How do you access it?

I have built a Mac client for MM which is not too mac-like but

How much trouble did you have compiling it big-endian?

Magic Money was not intended for serious real-money use. For a real-world
usable program, the crypto core would have been buried in many thousands
of lines of support code, and the program would never have seen the light
of day. It was intended to serve as a minimal but usable digicash program,
so people could play with digicash. It is not perfect, but it is the best
digicash system in the public domain. (It's the only digicash system in
the public domain, but that's beside the point!)
