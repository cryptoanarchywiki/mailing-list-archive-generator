I strongly disagree. If you truly insist, run your own telnetd on the
remote machine. Don't run a hack. However, the right solution is to
get the site manager to replace their telnet, a process that takes
minutes and which, given the current epidemic of line tapping, is of
obvious necessity even to the brain damaged. As I've noted, however,
its trivial to run your own telnetd on another port if you absolutely
insist.
