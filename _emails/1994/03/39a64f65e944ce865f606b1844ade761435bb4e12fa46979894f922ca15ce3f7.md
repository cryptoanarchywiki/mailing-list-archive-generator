This debate brings together two nationally prominent experts in 
this area. You won't want to miss the verbal fireworks and the 
opportunity to learn more about this important question.

Background
==========

The Clinton Administration is promoting use of the Clipper Chip 
technology that provides encryption, but in a form that law 
enforcement can unscramble. It also backs legislation requiring 
design of digital communications networks so ongoing surveillance 
will be feasible.

Law enforcement officials argue that these proposals are necessary 
to protect society from criminals and preserve important 
investigative tools.

Privacy advocates contend that these proposals grant broad new 
powers to law enforcement agencies and diminish protection for 
future users of the National Information Infrastructure.
Sponsored by the Stanford Law and Technology Policy Center and the 
Stanford Law and Technology Association.
