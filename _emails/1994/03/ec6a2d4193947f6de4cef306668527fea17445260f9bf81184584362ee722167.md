I think "anathema" may be the wrong word - I would suggest
"incorrect".  As the number of people who habitually use strong crypto
grows, the nefarious conversations will be lost in the noise about
last night's party and recipes for chocolate truffle cake.  The
likelihood that any particular conversation is of interest to LE/NS
types must drop as well.  This will be true unless the number of
strongly-encrypted nefarious conversations grows at least as fast as
the total number of strongly-encrypted conversations.  Somehow I fail
to believe that the supply of crooks is so large.
