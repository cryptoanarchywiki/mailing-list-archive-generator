Chill... I thought that our prime objective was to defeat Clipper...
even if you don't like Ross, he does have some pull with the people of
this country, and that's what we need... we need the *PEOPLE* to fight
Clipper.
 
We need the fight not to just be "a group of civil libertarians", but
the general populous.  Maybe Ross isn't the answer, but at least I've
taken a real step to try to oppose Clipper.  What the hell have you
done, Black Unicorn?

In the circles I travel in Mr. Perot is considered a dangerous paranoid.

I agree he has the ear of some *PEOPLE* (as you so nicely put it)
but as much as you fear the branding of the anti-clipper movement
as JUST "a group of civil libertarians," it is possible that there
are other brands just as destructive to credibility.

Mr. Perot is in my opinion represenative of one such brand.

The Good Perot Keeping Seal might sink the "general populous" boat
we would so much like to travel on.

As far as your efforts in this matter v. mine,

Anyone can post some messages to the list Mr. Ortenzi.
