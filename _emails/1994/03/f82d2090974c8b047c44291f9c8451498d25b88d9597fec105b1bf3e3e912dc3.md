Ludwig R. Vogel's letter to New York Newsday makes the point,
"...Government intercept procedures involving Clipper technology 
offer users no more protection from wrongful government surveillance 
than plain text."

FBI guys say they only want to keep the abilities they already have.
Vogel turns it around: they want to make sure we have no more
protection against them than we already have...except for key 
escrow...

      America's Bulwark Against Corruption!

 Every citizen has the right to the protection of 

              Two Rubber Stamps!*

   So wear your rubber stamps today, America!
