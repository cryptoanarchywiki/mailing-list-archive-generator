	 Amazing, ain't it?

Umm -- wasn't that story datelined February 11?

	 My oppinion is that while Bill may or may not be guilty, he'd
	 probably get away with it regardless... who in hell wants to
	 be known as the person responsible for sending a president up
	 the river?

Think back 20 years -- it would have happened then, to history's most
famous unindicted co-conspirator, had not Ford pardoned him for anything
he might or might not (hah!) have done.  (Fortunately, Agnew had already
resigned.)

	 Still, we did have to get rid of Bush and Quayle... :-I

Yup!
