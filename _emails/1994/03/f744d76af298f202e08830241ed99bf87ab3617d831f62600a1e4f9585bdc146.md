My first worry was whether it could be read at a distance, like
doorway radar scanners in the Mall.  That would impose a privacy
problem on the human possibly accompanying the animal.

If not (apparantly that's the case now), then I don't have a problem
with it.  Also, you could always remove it if needed.
