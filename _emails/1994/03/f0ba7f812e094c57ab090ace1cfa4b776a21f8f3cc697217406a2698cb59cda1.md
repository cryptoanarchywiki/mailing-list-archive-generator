If you had a 'breed' pet (like a dog, or cat with papers, or an exotic
bird) and paid in the thousands of dollars, you would view this device
as a way to discorage thieves.  Think of it as the Lojack of pets.

But I certainly don't advocate puting them in people...  And *I* don't
have one...  I think...  The size of a grain of rice...  Hmmm...  I
wonder what exactly is in those 'inventory controll' poles beside the
doors at shops...  I supose I'd better stay away from the free
vacinaiton programs offered by the government in the future...  I
wonder if the CIA/FBI/NSA had these things back in the swine flu
days... Man that shot hurt... Oh dear this is truely an evil line of
thought...
