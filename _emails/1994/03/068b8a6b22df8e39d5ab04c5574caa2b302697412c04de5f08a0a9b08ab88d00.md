Last night (4/16/94) both the Discover Channel and A & E Network ran 
specials on the OSS and the part that they played in helping the Allies 
win World War II. It was kind of interesting to see what went on back 
then. I didn't watch the whole thing because I grew tired of watching 
grainy black and white footage of people walking through mud and water 
in rain forests on Pacific islands. I'm just curious if there is any 
connection between these broadcasts, which were quite rah-rah about the 
need for covert intelligence agencies, and the current Skipjack debate.

Mike.
