I dissagree.  You may waste a few bytes, or maybe several Kb, but it would 
be worth it.

As I said in an earlier post:  you can either sacrifice space for security; or,
sacrifice security for space!

Now that I think about it, one wouldn't have to sacrifice any bandwidth 
whatsoever!  As, the stego program could be made to do wrap-around 
encoding.  Meaning that, as the end of the file is reached, encoding 
continues from the beginning until the appropriate offset is reached.
This would loose none of the additional security offered by the original 
method.

On a related note, someone has mentioned that fractals have a great 
ammount of potential for stego.  Their noise-threshold is much higher.  
You may want to look into that if you're concerned with conserving space.

It _should_ look like harmless information!  It would be _nice_ to be able
to know which files have been stegg'ed; but, that would either have the 
potential to tip off one's opponent as well or, it would require secure 
channels to propagate header keys (see previous message in thread for 
comments to this effect).

I do not advocate stego'ing data with telltale headers.  That combination is 
self defeating.  It must be noted that encrypted headers, as per your 
advice, would allow one to know that decription was successful, without 
sacrificing security.

You would have to decrypt it to find out.  The only problem may lie in 
figuring out the file-length.  Possible solutions are:

  1 - Put in some kind of EOF marker.  Scatter a some more through the file
      just in case, as well.  You may thus be required to make several
      attempts at decryption. 

  2 - Have a standard file length.  Break the original file into standard
      length packets.  Pad with noise, if neccessary.  Then send it through
      via multiple successive files.

This is much clearer, thank you.  However, I'm sure you realize that
if the key used to encrypt the header is standardized, and it's location 
of the header is standardized as well, much security is lost.  If its not 
standardized, secure channels must exist for its propagation (ie: no need 
for stego).

Yes, stego is all but invalidated if you try and hide patterned information.
That is why I recommend using "Stealth PGP" and/or a Mimic-function in 
combination with the standard stego we've been discussing.

You need not give up the offset-method to do this.  They should work 
together for additional security.

This is a good idea.  It will save you time you would have otherwise used
to try and decrypt the whole file.  However, this should only be used if 
the header fits in uniformly with the rest of the file.  Otherwise, the 
file will stand out as encrypted.  Of course, the data should be 
uniformly encrypted with Stealth PGP or its equivalent, as well.

The function of Stealth PGP, as I understand it, is not only to encrypt 
without information as to the intended reciever, but to leave no trace of 
encryption whatsoever.  Thus the need for a seperate, encrypted, header.
I think your modified proposal should work just fine.

If the desteg program automatically checks for encrypted, hidden 
fileheaders via un-stealth-pgp, it may be as simple as you've pointed 
out, anyway.

Your idea will save time at no loss to security, if the header is encrypted.
I see a problem only if the header is:

   1 - unencrypted
or
   2 - encrypted with a non-public key
or
   3 - encrypted but anamalous


If its encrypted with a public-key and blends in with the rest of the 
data and the rest of the file it should be fine.
