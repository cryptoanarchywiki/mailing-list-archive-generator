Quoting from the Feb. 24 News-Gazette of Champaign-Urbana, Illinois:

"UI student arrested for e-mail threat to Clinton"

     URBANA -- A University of Illinois student has been arrested for
threatening the life of President Clinton, U.S. Attorney Frances Hulin
announced today.
     Christopher James Reincke, 18, of Townsend Hall, Urbana, allegedly
sent an electronic mail message to the White House on Dec. 4 threatening
Clinton, Hulin stated in a press release.
     The message read: "I am curious, Bill, how would you feel about being
the first president to be killed on the same day as his wife ...  It would
be best, I think, to not continue with your immediate plans.  Perhaps a
vacation.  You will die soon.  You can run, but you cannot hide."
     The message was signed "Overlord" and purported to be from
"Allmighty@Never.Gonna.Catch.Me."
     Reincke appeared before U.S. District Judge Harold A. Baker in
Danville today and was released on his own recognizance.
     Hulin said the charge resulted from an investigation by the Secret
Service and the UI police.
     Investigators determined the message originated at the UI, and a
computer trace identified Reincke as the apparent author, Hulin said.
     While being questioned by agents, Reincke admitted he had sent the
message, according to the press release.
