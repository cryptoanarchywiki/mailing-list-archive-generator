I once asked my grandfather if he was sure he could take apart the tractor he
was working on.  His response?  "A man put it together."  Anything one man can
do, another can undo--the only variable is the degree of effort required.  I'm
sure we can make a tamper-resistant chip, but can we make a tamper-proof one?
No.

Considering the determination and intelligence of some of the people involved,
I'm sure that a tamper-resistant chip would be compromised pretty quickly.
