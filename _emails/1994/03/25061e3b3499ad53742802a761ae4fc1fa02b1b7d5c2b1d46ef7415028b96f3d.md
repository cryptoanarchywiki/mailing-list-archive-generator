No.  The only way to do this would be to tell PGP to use this file as
a keyring, but you can't do that if its in ASCII armor.  Besides, the
fingerprint was designed to be used to verify the key when you sign
it, not as anything that should be used to know whether you want to
add the key to the keyring, therefore it is only possible to -kvc
something on your keyring.

FYI: If you say that yes, you want to sign it, while you are adding it
to your keyring, it will then display the fingerprint for you.

Hope this answers your question.
