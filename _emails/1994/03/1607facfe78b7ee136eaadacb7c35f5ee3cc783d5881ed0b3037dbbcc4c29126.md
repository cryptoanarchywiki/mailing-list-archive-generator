I second that, but I didn't vote for clinton, I voted against
bush. I never (or very rarely) vote for anyone; I decide which
candidate that is likely to win I dislike most and vote for whoever 
is likeliest to beat them. a vote for anyone else is usually a vote
for the one I don't want to win. 

if clinton had been the one I disliked more than bush I would have
voted for bush, not perot.

if the republicans can manage to field someone I dislike less than
clinton in 96, I will vote for them. with his attacks on privacy 
and the second amendment, my dislike for clinton goes up every day.
