	Would I still be able to recieve mail at my account?
	Just how much attention does it bring?  Is it feasible
	for a student on a conservative system(read fascist) to
	get away with a low profile one?  I know low profile is
	not the goal, but I do want to help if possbile.

	this is a concern of mine actually.  I am really more
	worried about what would happen to fellow cypherpunks
	interested in this if the prototypes were quickly
	attacked by the law, than wether I would get in trouble
	or not.  I myself am rooted in the U.S. as far as the
	forseeable future goes, so I definetly need to consider
	these things.  What would be the legal implications of me
	operating a site with a physical location outside the
	U.S. from a site in the U.S.  By telnetting to it or
	something?  Would that system be subject to the laws of
	my nation, or would the be subject to the nation of there
	physical location.  hehe, actually this may be a good
	idea, just to add to legal confusion for the lawyers to
	shovel thru if they want to get to me or the system.
	This way we could have a foreign IP addres, a US operator
	and perhaps users from various nations, rendering us a
	nice thick soup of legalities.

	Yeah it would be hairy at the least.  Well one reason to
	allow storage space is for those who do not have a system
	at home, students using labs, those who only acces is on
	a company machine, which could easily be watched, or if
	encryptian becomes illegal, or heavily restricted, it
	would take pressure off of some people to let someone
	else hold the evidence so to speak.  I never thought of
	putting it outside US jurisdiction myself, but it's a
	good idea, hmmm.

	This reminds me of something, what is the policy
	towardsreposting letters here to various boards on BBSs
	where there may be interested people?  Like would you
	mind if I posted your rant there?  I have posted a few
	things from cypherpunks already, like anon-remailerinfo
	and how to use and set-up one, in the Undergroud Forum on
	ISCA, which is a very big system.  I would think it is
	welcomed but thought I should check it out.  I think that
	the more people you touch the more people you'll
	eventually have involved more deeply.
