Mr. May et al:

The couple of lines re pornographic language seems to have diverted
the apprecation of the problem reported in the message.  This message
is about whether or not Compu$erve should get away scott free for bullying
one of their subscribers while they attempt to steal use of his trade-
marked software which he had been offering on Compu$erve for some time.

Please reread the msg.
