Please pardon the date errors in the previous post about the Washington DC
Congressional hearings on Digital Telephony.  The date is March 19, 1994
- tomorrow.  

For those that missed the original announcement, the Senate Tech & Law
Subcommittee and House Civil Liberties Subcommittee are holding a hearing
at the Dirksen Building Rm. 266, featuring testimony from EFF's Jerry
Berman and FBI's Louis Freeh, et al., regarding the FBI Digital Telephony
"Wiretap Bill". 

Call the Senate Judiciary staff at +1 202 224 3406 for more info.

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
