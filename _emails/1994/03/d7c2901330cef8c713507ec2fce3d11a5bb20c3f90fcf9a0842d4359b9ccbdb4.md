Marc, when I said "And when you get a new account, remember to post to

PS London has the same degree of camera surveillance as you said
Germany has.  There's a big centre at Kings Cross Station where
all the Railway Police have their monitors (of all the Underground
entrances) and another one at New Scotland Yard where all the 
transport police have theirs.  The ones in the underground - which
are ostensibly just for mass crowd volume monitoring - have an
absolutely deadly killer zoom lens that's centrally steerable.

It's *way* overkill for the use it's supposed to be for...
