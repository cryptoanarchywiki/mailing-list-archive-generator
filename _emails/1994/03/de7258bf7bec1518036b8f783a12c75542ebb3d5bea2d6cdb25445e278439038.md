You can find this document via gopher to chaos.bsu.edu; look in the
"Anonymous Mail" directory for "Next Generation Remailers".

If the remailer is set up properly you should be able to receive your
ordinary mail as well.  Make sure though, the remailers I ran on
rosebud dropped mail because the incoming mail directory was in a
different place (something like /usr/mail instead of /usr/spool/mail).
But I liked this behavior so I left it ;)
