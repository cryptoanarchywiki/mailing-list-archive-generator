There has been some discussion over the last week about what is a 'right',
and whether the right to vote is a right or not, as the basis is a ruling by 
the Supreme Court.

However there seems to be strong support for the right to vote in several
amendments. Apart from the lenthy 12th amendment describing the process of
electing Presidents and Vice-Presidents, there are:

Amendment XV                                           (1870)

Section 1. THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES TO VOTE 
shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any 
state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.

Amendment XIX                                          (1920)

THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES TO VOTE shall not 
be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on 
account of sex.

Amendment XXIV                                          (1964)

Section 1. THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES TO VOTE 
in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, 
for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or 
Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by 
the United States or any state by reason of failure to pay any 
poll tax or other tax.

Amendment XXVI                                         (1971)

Section 1. THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES, who 
are 18 years of age or older, TO VOTE, shall not be denied or 
abridged by the United States or any state on account of age.
