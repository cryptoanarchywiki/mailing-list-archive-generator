Wasn't stenography standardized in the last century? Or am I thinking
of shorthand?

Though I avoid spelling flames, the repeated confusion of
steganography ("covered/hidden writing") with what court reporters and

And the statistics of the low-order bits in various sorts of images
were discussed about six months ago here, by various folks.
