Are you so sure about this?  Yes, most people receive some of their 
income in a paycheck.  Be advised, though, the underground economy is 
vigorous and robust.  Are their any mechanics out there who *don't*  do 
auto repair on the side?  Accountants?  Plumbers?  Programmers?  I also 
find it hard to believe most waiters and waitresses are reporting their 
tips.  I'm sure we could extend this list for hours.  Digital cash 
transactions could easily surpass above ground transfers.  Not everyone 
nor every dollar needs to go via digital channels to (a) make a digital 
bank successful or (b) put a major crimp in the ability to finance 
government.

Don't be so sure, Hal.  There are, and will be, plenty of financial 
transaction that will never, or rarely, need to convert to or from cash.  
When they do, well, that's what ATMs are for.
