I'm not really sure what you mean by "insecure for public keys".  I'm  
not trying to achieve "security through obscurity".  I'm trying to  
achieve "deniability through obscurity".

If the reverse steg process makes it look like all, or even many,  
files contain hidden messages, even when they don't, then you can  
plausible deny knowledge of a suspicious bit pattern in any specific  
file.
