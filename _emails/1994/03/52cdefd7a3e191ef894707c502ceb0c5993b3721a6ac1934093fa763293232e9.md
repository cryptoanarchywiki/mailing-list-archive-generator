If you're seriously worried about los Federales expending this degree of
effort on you, you must lead a radically more exciting life than _I_ do.

In the relatively isolated area where I live, anyone parked close enough to
my house to do this sort of thing (and given the ambient foliage, that'd be
_mighty_ close) would stick out like a sore thumb.

This is not a scenario over which I plan to lose much sleep.
