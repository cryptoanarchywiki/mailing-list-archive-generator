Not really, the receiver of these numbers could run it through several
crypt programs with random keys gotten from his machine, etc.  If you do
several hundred rounds with several hundred random keys with random delays,
the random numbers resulting from all this abuse should be quite different
from anything that whoever is spying on the transmission will see...
 
(Granted, though this would still be a PRNG, it would be better than most,
if the purpose of these random numbers is to simply act as a RN server.)

I haven't heard about this... can you tell us more?
