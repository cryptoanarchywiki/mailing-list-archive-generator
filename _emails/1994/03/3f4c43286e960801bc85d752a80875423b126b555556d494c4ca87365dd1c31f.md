Amazing, ain't it?  Maybe when Billary falls down come next election time,
we'd have the possibility of picking Gore????  Doubtful...  So what would
happen if that take Billary away for the whitewatter crap?  Would Gore
automagically become the new prez?  (Or will Billary pardon him/herself?)

I wonder.... if Hillary is about to be slow-roasted, can Bill issue a
prez-pardon to save her butt?  Or is it far more likely that he'll go
down to the hoosegow with her?   My oppinion is that while Bill may or
may not be guilty, he'd probably get away with it regardless... who in
hell wants to be known as the person responsible for sending a president
up the river?

Still, we did have to get rid of Bush and Quayle... :-I
