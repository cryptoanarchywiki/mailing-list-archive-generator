 in response to rishab@dxm.ernet.in   about jeo-six-pack and the 
general public

those folks, are the ones that could make an outcry that would bring to light
the NSA trying to hoodwink us all. though they might not have much power
as individuals, take any group in mass, and you get power
might not be a controlable power, but that is what you got.
i would rather inform as many people about the things i read on this list
as just set at home and say, "don
't bother they'll never understand it"" apathy of any kind can kill you
and will stunt your creative growth.
