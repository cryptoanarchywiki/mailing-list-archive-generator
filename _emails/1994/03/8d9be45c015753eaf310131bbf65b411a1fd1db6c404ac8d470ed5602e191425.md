My guess would be that something like aluminum foil would do just fine
I remember seeing some ads for some space age drapes that block all IR as
to prevent your room forom overheating from sunlight in the summer and
from your room leaking heat to the outside in the winter... looked a lot
like aluminum foil to me...  any idea on whether this stuff can still 
be found today?
