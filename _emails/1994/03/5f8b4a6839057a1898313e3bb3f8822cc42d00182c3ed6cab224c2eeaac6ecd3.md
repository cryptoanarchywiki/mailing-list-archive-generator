It's probably time for us to remind the security services (over and over)
that they're within their rights to pass rules like "if you have access to
classified information, then you're required to include the info's owning
agency as a recipient in every encrypted message you send (since PGP and
RIPEM both allow multiple recipients and there's nothing to stop the Dept
of Energy, the CIA, the NSA, etc., from generating PGP and RIPEM keys to be
used for this purpose.)

This might have a chilling effect on whistleblowers, but it should keep
those agencies from claiming that PGP and RIPEM are a security threat via
spies.
