It's neither correct or incorrect because the specific notion of
randomness hasn't been specified.

Your statement is falsifiable, however, since sometimes a non-random
string of bits is what you want to get out, if what you would expect
to get out normally was also non-random.  And you want them to be
non-random in the same way.

>Should I be using the  
>phrase "high entropy" instead of "random"?

No.  This was the notion of random I pointed out that didn't work.  If
you add 16 zeros to the front of a gigabit random message, that's
pretty recogizable, even though the entropy is may be very close to
maximum.

Don't count on it.  Statistical tests can find correlations you hadn't
suspected were there.  In fact, for some message types, _not_ finding
the correlations may indicate dithering, or maybe a steganographic
message.

If the prior probabilities of the message type that you're hiding in
are not random, the steganographic extraction shouldn't be either,
because then there's a distinction between an unaltered container and
an incoded one.
