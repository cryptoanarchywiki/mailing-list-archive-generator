Hey there all.
	I've been lurking here for a while, and I wanted to know if any of you 
can recomend some books for me to read so I can get started with crypto. 
	Reason A) So that I can understand more of what you are saying.
	Reason B) Because I find the topic fascinating and want to learn more 
about it, as well as maybe (only possibly) write my own encrytption program 
(for personal use and the like)

	Any info would be greatly appreciated....
