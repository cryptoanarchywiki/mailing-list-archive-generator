There was an article in a recent New Scientist (maybe last week) that
mentioned the use of infrared scans of faces to identify people since its
very hard to change the thermal image of your face by surgery. The plan is
to scan every one passing through the airport and forward the image to the
FBI (or whoever the local cops are I guess, but it said FBI) and they check
out thier database of know terorists (and cypherpunks) and it rings the
local gaurds if they get a match. 

I can try to find the whole article if anyones interested.
