With all the speculation about IR surveillance, I thought I'd forward
a fairly meaty article about actual products for video surveillance.

If this interests you, Part 2 is in alt.conspiracy.

By the way, alt.conspiracy is one of the most consistently
entertaining newsgroups out there. Bizarre stuff about UFOs and mind
control, to seemingly accurate stuff about U.S. development of
biolgoical weapons and plans for increased surveillance. Use a good
newsreader and just scan the titles for interesting threads.

Glenda Stocks forwards a lot of good articles (though I don't vouch
for their accuracy in all cases) about topics of interest to
Cypherpunks. Though the source is alt.conspiracy, they're often less
paranoid than some of the idle speculations many of us (including me!)
sometimes make. At least these are quasi-journalistic pieces.

Enjoy them.

THE WORLD OF SURVEILLANCE

This Month's Special

The clock that can tell time and also tell on you!

Deep in the laboratory of Knox Security comes the great creation of the
remote controlled covert clock. It looks like a gigantic Hong Kong wrist
watch, but hidden below the LCD display is a camera with pan, tilt & zoom.
All operations are wireless.

The KS300 Remote Controlled Covert Clock (12"x12"x4") has the following
features:

1) Very High Frequency video link for high security needs (1300Mhz FM, 10Ghz
optional). NTSC format is standard and PAL is available,

2) Accurate remote commands with digital proportional circuits. A 72Mhz FM
link is used for the command transmission,

3) Low power consumption (either 110/220VAC or optionally rechargeable led
acid or lithium pack),

4) specially treated mirror glass for very low light loss,

5) 6:1 or 10:1 zoom ratio,

6) rugged remote control briefcase (12"x32"x30") with 5" monitor and two joy
sticks for commanding: power on/off, transmitter on/off, camera on/off,
variable pan/tilt control, variable focus and zoom control.

The pan/tilt uses plastic Delron gears and solid state switching components
for whisper quiet movements - undetectable to the person(s) being spied on.
The pan range is 125 degrees and the tilt range is 50 degrees.

The clock face can be removed when it is necessary to hide the unit in a wall
cavity for long term (or 3rd party) surveillance applications. Without the
clock face the pan and tilt ranges are 355 and 80 degrees respectively. Other
``faces'' can be custom designed.

Knox Security Engineering has so far refused to answer Full Disclosure's
request for pricing information on the KS300. However, sources indicate that
the cost is $27,000.00.

Contact: Knox Security Engineering Corporation, 335 Greenwich Av, Greenwich,
CT 06830. Phone: (203) 622-7300, Fax: (203) 662-7418.

WHAT'S TEXAS UP TO?

The Texas Department of Public Safety, Intelligence Unit, Box 4087, Austin,
Texas 78773, Phone: (512) 465-2200 is increasing its ability to
electronically spy on those in Texas with the purchase of the following
equipment in August of 1990:

Unitized Intelligence Recording System:

Receiver, recorder, and transmitter will be housed in an inconspicuous, high
impact commercial grade attache-type case with an antenna installed in the
case lid. The cassette recorder will be removable for independent operations.
Panel mounted controls and indicator system operate on/off switch, charge
indicator lamp, power on indicator, recorder manual/automatic switch, battery
test indicator, battery status switch for internal batteries. One crystal
supplied with each receiver; additional crystals $75.00 each. Transmitter and
receiver shall have FCC type acceptance and certification.

Receiver (general description): Voice scrambler standard, VHF high band FM,
start-of-the-art GAAS FET RF environment. Dual front end receiver circuitry
to provide repeater capability, with separate outputs for earphone, VCR, and
line level audio. Receiver specifications: Frequency range: 150 to 174 mhz.
Channel capacity: Two (2) 1.7mhz wide frequency bands, may be separated up to
24mhz.

Transmitter: A narrow band FM 500mw disguise body transmitter with 9 volt DC
power supply utilizing two (2) 9 volt alkaline batteries, switch selectable,
clear or scrambled voice transmission standard. The antenna and electret
condensor microphone supplied with transmitter.

11 of these systems were ordered

Ball Cap Transmitters as per the following:

Each transmitter shall be concealable in a ``baseball-type'' cap, with a a
specially modified ball cap supplied, utilizing one P-80 6 volt battery in an
integral, slide in, battery contract. An internal electret microphone and
external plat pack antenna will be supplied. The transmitter shall have an
on/off switch. Frequency: 150-174 mhz, Channels: One (1). RF Power out:
120mw. Operating time: 3 hrs using factory fresh battery @68 degrees F.
Example: AID TX-731B-CAT #95129-02 or Equal.
