CALL FORWARD FOR CRIME
Criminals have discovered that by forwarding their calls, they can evade
wiretaps placed on their home lines. "Criminals can go to any phone, call
the `intelligent network' and route calls anywhere," says an FBI special
agent. The FBI estimates that 25% of all wiretaps "are adversely affected"
by this telephone hide-and-seek. (Wall Street Journal 3/18/94 A5A)

What the hell is with the FBI and figures?

First they cant come up with any effects, then it's 91 instances, which
was not released in EFF's FOIA request, now it's 25% of all wiretaps....
which to my math sounds like 75 or so.

Oh boy....
