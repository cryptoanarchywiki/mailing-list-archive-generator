How soon would it be before they will decide that anyone who is afraid
of what the NSA and its fans must be paranoid, so paranoid that they
must be insane and thus, must be put in a mental institution because they
are a danger to themselves and others.  Never mind that there aren't any
mental institutions left, they can reopen them.

Oh, and anyone who disagrees with King Kongress and Billary must also be
insane, why would anyone disagree with the direct descendents of the Gods!

:-)
