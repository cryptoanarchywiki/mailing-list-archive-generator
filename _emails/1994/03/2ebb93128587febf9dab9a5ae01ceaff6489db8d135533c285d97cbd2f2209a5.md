A friend from the USPTO mentioned that he'd set up a PTO WWW server at 
http://www.uspto.gov/

Went and had a look, not a whole lot of stuff yet, but there's some probably-
important material here, including transcripts of the Arlington and San
Jose hearings on software patents.  These can now be found also at 
ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Intellectual_Property/
gopher://gopher.eff.org/00/EFF/Policy/Intellectual_Property/
http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Intellectual_Property/

The www.uspto.gov site has the benefit of having html versions up, so that
you can find specific testimony, which is quite handy:

http://www.uspto.gov/text/pto/hearings/arlington.html
http://www.uspto.gov/text/pto/hearings/san_jose.html

There are also Unix ASCII, DOS ASCII, compress'd ASCII, gzip'd ASCII,
Adobe Acrobat Exchange PDF, and MS-Word for Mac (BinHex'd StuffIt archive) 
formats available at the PTO site.  

Also available (at both the USPTO and EFF paths) is a file containing the
collected written testimony submitted to both hearings.

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
