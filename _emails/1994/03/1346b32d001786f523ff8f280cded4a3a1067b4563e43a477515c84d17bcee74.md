Though I've not seen much traffic here in cypherpunks on the new exportable
version of RIPEM/SIG, I do think that its latest release is significant.
RIPEM/SIG plus the new version of RSAREF is going to allow my firm to do
some development on products that were not realizable with PGP (because of
export controls, as well as licensing and patent issues.)

For those of you who are also interested in the exportable RIPEM/SIG
version 1.2a, the files are now available via anonymous ftp or by using
Mosaic/World-Wide-Web.

Unlike the binaries for RIPEM 1.2a, these files are available via anonymous
ftp -- you don't need an account on the server to download the files (in
order to get an account you have send an email message saying that you are
an US or Canadian user.)

The press release on RIPEM/SIG from Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu> is at:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/posting

Binary files are at:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-68030-macintosh-commandline-1.2a.sit.hqx

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-80x86-dos-vanilla-1.2a.exe

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-hppa-hpux9.01-1.2a

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-ibm-rs6000-aix3.2-1.2a

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-sparc-sunos4.1.1-1.2a

There does not seem to be separate documentation for RIPEM/SIG yet, so I
guess you have to use the documentation for RIPEM 1.2a:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripem.man
        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemusr.doc
        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemusr.txt

A current list of RIPEM public keys is at:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/pubkeys.txt

The new RSAREF source code that RIPEM/SIG is based on was made available
today the rsa.com server.
