You obviously don't understand much of the "loud-mouthed ass's psychology."  
Limbaugh is very anti-statist and if he had a position on the issue 
there's a good change it would be anti-clipper.  Last time I checked, 
the clipper's biggest supporters were Clinton and Gore, who aren't exactly
Rush's favorite people.
