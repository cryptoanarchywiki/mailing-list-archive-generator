I agree that it does not happen in that way in cyberspace, but I disagree 
that it does not happen at all.  Confused people in cyberspace tend to 
talk of topic instead of being silent.  If you are a good moderator, you 
can almost read the minds of the people who are confused.  I admit it 
takes more skill in cyberspace, but it is still quite possible.
