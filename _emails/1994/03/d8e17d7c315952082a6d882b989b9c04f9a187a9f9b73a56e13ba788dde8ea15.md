  Right. The NSA doesn't have a copy of Applied Cryptography, and has
  never seen one. Yet, apparently, they signed off on my original CJ
  request to export the printed book (the State letter mentions comments
  from the Department of Defense, which is always a code phrase for the
  NSA in such situations).


Perhaps they want to vet the disk to make sure you didn't use
stego to hind something "illegal" on|in it.
