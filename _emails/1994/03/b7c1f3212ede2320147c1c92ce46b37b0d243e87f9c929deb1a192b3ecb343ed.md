If I may make a small correction here, I suggested a tamperproof software 
module could be used in an offline system to process transactions in a 
way which prevented "ANONYMOUS double spending".  This is not the same as 
preventing double spending, although in a system where reputations 
matter, it has a certain deterrent effect.

Obscuring the operation of an algorithm inside a tamperproof module isn't
security through obscurity any more than obscuring plaintext by
encipherment is security through obscurity.
