The AT&T Surety Communications Voice/Data Terminal  4100  is
an STUIII with a type IIIe (e for export, read clipper) cryptographic
algorithm, the model numbers for type I and type II STUIIIs are series
1000 and 2000 respectively.

For Sensitive,
Business Applications

    The AT&T Surity Voice/Data Terminal 4100 provides
    secure voice and data communications in one integrated
    package.

      It works both as a full-featured telephone for voice
    calls and as a smart modem for data applications.  Part
    of an AT&T familty of Surity products, the Voice/Data
    Terminal is compact and light enough to carry with you
    when you travel.

      Developed in conjunction with the U.S. Government's
    STU-III program, the Voice/Data Terminal 4100 is
    designed to protect domestic and internation business
    communications.

There are clipper phones that accept data.  This is probably the
one the DOJ buys.  Basing arguments on fallicies is counterproductive,
and is the sort of thing Tim May was talking about.
