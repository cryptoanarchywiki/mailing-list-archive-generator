	Ever been on a "private" bbs, or talked to peole who (talk to 
people, who talk to people, etc.)have been on one? You get software 
released on 4 Jun (for example), on 6 June it's cracked, and by 7 June, 
it is available on every single continent (barring Antarctica - although 
i'm not certain about that - supposedly there are equally private 
internet nodes around somewhere...). While the might of bands like 
Paranoimia, Skid Row, and Razor 1911 are usually concentrated on games, 
their expertise applies equally well to "serious" software - it's just 
that games are more marketable/popular and thus get the crackers' names 
to more people.
	PS - the example above is an overestimate - it often happens that 
software is cracked and distributed within HOURS of release.
