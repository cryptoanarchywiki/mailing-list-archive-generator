Is the stuff they make fences out of okay for this?  My excuse for putting
this up (if I have to make up an excuse) is that I'm going to have lots of
PC's in the room and I don't want the FCC complaining...

Can camcorders be used to detect this?  A friend of mine had this old b&w
surveilence camera that could pick up an IR beam off a remote.  Are the lasers
in the same range or do I need IR gear?

How can I detect this?  Will the usual microwave oven leak detectors help?
I don't want to confuse high frequency stuff (900Mhz or above) as a reason
to be paranoid. :-)
