OOPS!  I goofed!  Sorry about that, hope nobody tried that high a dose..
It's kinda hard to know what to reccomend when you're doing 1000mgs of
the stuff...  These days, I've cut down on it and only do one once a
week or so because depending on how much I've eaten before I pop a
niacin, I get the flush from hell, or no flush at all...

For the least flushing effects, take one after you eat... for
defeating the airport security infra-red scans whenever they will
come in use, eat nothing, but a single niacin at whatever dosage you
feel comfortable with.

Beware that on an empty stomach flushing will occur within a very
short while (say about 10-15 minutes or less!) so keep that time in
mind before you board the plane, and remember to pop one before
you get off the plane...

An after-effect (after the flushing) is that you may feel chills
after a large dose wore off...  I'm not sure if that actually
messes up an ir camera from ID'ing you off your normal ir scan,
or if it's just your body adjusting itself to not having
niacin in your blood, or what....
