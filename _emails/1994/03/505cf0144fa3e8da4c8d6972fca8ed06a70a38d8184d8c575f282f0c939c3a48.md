I'll address the last first: I meant to imply neither. I don't think
encrypting traffic from cypherpunks tomorrow would have the desired
effect. However, I'll gladly work towards the day when such a change
can be transparent to its readers.

I would like to see greater independence from the list. With the help
of anonymous mailing and forwarding services, and with the use of a
secure machine, I may be able to read and respond to the list without
ever betraying my participation. Why announce to the world that I read
cypherpunks if I don't have to?

Your particular connectivity and the ease of reading mail on-line seem
to have conspired to make decryption (as well as offline reading and
archiving!) quite onerous. If you lack a secure, connected machine at
the office, and have no IP (or UUCP!) service at home, I think you're
at a strong disadvantage towards reading any encrypted traffic at all.
Is there no means for you to automate offline mail reading?

The user with a 300 baud modem and a VT100 terminal at home should not
expect to be practicing secure encryption. Any better-equipped user
has the hardware needed to encrypt and decrypt securely -- they just
haven't written the software.

Point taken; but if you receive unencrypted mail on a multi-user
system, you're likely deluding yourself about its security as well. I
am motivated to provide the list to anyone that wants it without
advertising your subscription (and its traffic) to your service
provider. Anonymous posting, meet anonymous subscribers.

I can think of several reasons why cypherpunks would not be the only
list for which encrypted traffic might be desired.

"Indeed."

I hadn't intended this to be taken as name calling. Really.
