Mike says (paraphrased)
1> Signing isn't enough, since many people post stuff without checking
(true, but it's *more* checkable that way, especially for the people
who post verbatim rather than abstracting.)
2> PGP is too hard to use
No accounting for taste, I suppose :-)
3) We're a Mac shop
ViaCrypt *can* run on top of SoftPC.  It's not blazingly fast,
and certainly increases the hard-to-use factor, but it's doable.
And you generally convert your postings into ASCII to post anyway -
is your mail system also a Mac?  (Probably a Sun, I suppose,
but ViaCrypt is available for some Unix platforms now.)
