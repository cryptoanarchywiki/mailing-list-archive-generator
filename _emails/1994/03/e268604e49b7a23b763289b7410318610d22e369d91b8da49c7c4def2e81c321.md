Operatives:

Once again citizen.unit.miller is getting out of hand.  You have been
warned about allowing these subversive postings of his [see below] to reach
the Net.  Having failed in your primary duty, you are hereby instructed to
encourage the creation of the referenced message base.  Once this is
accomplished, these subversive elements will have unwittingly established
(1) a method whereby we can more closely monitor the level of their
knowledge; (2) a method whereby we can measure information dispersal rates;
and (3) a convenient source for the infusion of disinformation.  

You know what to do.

The Management.
