Not quite as you think.  You see, only the posts with (6) in front of
them were visible to those in the 6th row. :-)  The AOL Time Odeon
auditorium is broken up into the stage (everyone sees what gets posted
from there, but only those on the stage can send messages to the stage.)
From there on everyone is assigned a row.  In my case it was the 6th row.
 
There were 85 people listening to the confrence, probably also generating
as much noise as the folks in my row..  However neither Denning nor
Barlow can see the conversations in row 6.  Neither can the folks in
row 50, or 95, or 69 or 666 see what's talked in row six unless they
move to row six.  :-)  Weird, but true.

AOL does provide the ability to send questions and comments to those in
power on the stage.  I sent quite a few flamatory messages down Dennings
way of course, however, no comment/question of mine made it. :-)

Ah, censorship at its best... (My questions were in the lines of,
Dr. Denning, how can someone of your intelligence possibly support the
idea of giving full control of everyone's privacy over to the government
we all know to be quite corrupt, and the old, why should we pay $10Billion
in taxes a year to help the feds catch 10 or so cases a year via wire
tapping...)

She didn't see any of it, except for the flame questions I sent, and
quite possibly a huge ammount of others in the audience.  THere were
85 or so folks there...

Ineed, too bad she couldn't see the comments.  Too bad I wasn't on
stage with JPB to grill her to a nice shade of dark brown toast..

Well, I had my fun. :-)  I'll post up a clean *official* transcript
of this session when one becomes available...
