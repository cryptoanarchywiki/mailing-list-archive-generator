Indeed, I'm getting a little bit hopeful about things. To wit:

- the Republicans who embraced statism and Big Government when their
party held the top dog position are gradually returning to their
anti-government rhetoric.

(Caveats: Some of it is political opportunism. And not all of them
feel this way. And if the Repubs win in '96, as seems increasingly
likely, all bets could be off.)

I'm hopeful that the Dems can also regain their traditional concern
for civil liberties, for concerns that a fascist state will use its
surveillance powers to oppress the citizenry, and that things like
Digital Big Brother need to be opposed.

I'm glad Clinton won in '92....it shows the nation that Democrats can
run police state policies worthy of George Bush, it shook Republicans
out of the their comfortable governing stance, and it proves
ultimately that neither side is any less contemptuous of individual
liberties than the other.
