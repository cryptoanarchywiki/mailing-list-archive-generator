The trouble with the cypherpunk remailers is there isn't a single
one of them I'd trust.  The overwhelming credo of the sort of person
I've met in this area is that they want extreme absolute privacy
for *themselves* but sneak and spy on everything they possibly
can about everyone else.  (Oops - that sounds bad - I don't specifically
mean the people who run cypherpunk remailers; I mean people who're
obsessive about secrecy in general and hackers in particular.  Secretive
hackers being the worst.)

And you can take it as read that every remailer will be logged by the
Black Hats too.  Only double-blinded *encrypted* remailing is going
to have any chance of maintaining secrecy, and then only if you go
out of your way to explicitly chain round dozens of remailers in the
hope of finding *one* that isn't compromised.  (And that, only if all
the remailers are regularly spoofing traffic between themselves to foil
traffic analysis)
