I've mailed eric on this, but no response yet and our time is running 
out. 

If seattle was to get a group meeting set up for saturday and we wanted 
to link up with the bay area meeting, what _exactly_ should I be asking 
for? MBONE connections? (is this video, btw, or just an audio link?)

I was hoping to get this set up, but.. we'll see.

answers appreciated.
