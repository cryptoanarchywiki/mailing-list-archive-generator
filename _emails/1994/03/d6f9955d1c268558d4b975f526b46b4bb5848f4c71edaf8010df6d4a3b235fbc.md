Speak for yourself. I process five hundred or more messages a
day. Anything that would add even moments to the time it takes me to
reply to a message would eliminate whats left of the time I spend with
my friends and S.O. Maybe you have lots of time on your hands, but the
rest of us have real lives and don't want to spend them trying to set
up a cryptography system for each of our correspondants. In a year or
so, maybe this will all likely be practical -- but it isn't now.

You are more or less like someone in 1976 advocating that everyone
quit typing and start using only word processors, when the computers
weren't yet cheap enough. Have some patience.

Perry
