I think we agree philosophically.  Where we diverge is in our understanding
of things-as-they-are.  I contend that large companies, MS being one 
example, often enlist the government and its coercive powers in their
service.

One issue where I think I've seen MS's hand is "intellectual property".
My concern about "intellectual property" is that MS and some others have
changed the terms of the debate ["property" is protected more than
"privilege"] and the law to further their own interests, to the detriment
of the rest of us.

We need to  reduce the power of government so that it cannot be enlisted 
in any company's service.

That said, I am following your advice:  With the exception of the
ubiquitous DOS/Windows operating systems, I've gotten rid of every MS 
product on my machines.  If OS/2 ever grows up [can handle a 14.4k 
faxmodem for example], I'll be MS free.

I'm tired of this shit.
Now, imagine if SPA owned the internet....
