Thanks Bob... that admission from the opposing forces has
made all of our effort in this fight worth it...

This makes the complete devaluation of this "Clipper/Tessara"
nightmare relatively easy.... we doing good... keep the pressure up!!
This has lifted the fog of battle for us momentarily...

 Here I start to wonder about you Bob...
OUR Government caused the current issues we are seeing haunt this country...
and they want the keys to ALL the secrest??? Not a chance in HELL Bob...
I AND OTHERS WILL MAKE SURE THAT CLIPPER IS TOTALLY SUNK!!!

count on it!!
     anon
p.s. to the punks... keep it up...
you are doing a GREAT job...(anon pats himself on the back also!!)
