Security Insider Report is published by Interpact press 11511 Pine
St. N. Seminole, Fl 34642 Phone 813.393.6600 Fax 813.393.6361

 The managing editor is none other than computer security
professional, privacy advocate, and author of TERMINAL COMPROMISE,
Winn Schwartau.
 
 Winn is a highly sought after lecturer on computer security
matters, and is notorious for "Inside" contacts. It is said the NSA
scoured it's ranks after TERMINAL COMPROMISE came out. T.C. was
released as the first Internet novel (its in softcover as well) and
should be widely available. He is supposed to be a releasing a new
book soon (it may already be out) titled INFORMATION WARFARE.

 Having had the pleasure of meeting and talking at length with
Winn, I am of the opinion that he may be on to something here.
