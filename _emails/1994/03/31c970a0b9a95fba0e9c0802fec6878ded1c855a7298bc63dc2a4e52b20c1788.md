Don't you hate it when you see something posted after it's already old
news, and its been posted 3 times already.

I hope I haven't done that.

The March 21 business week has a full page article on Clipper, the FBI
Telephony bill, and relatved matters.

It has a back page editorial that comes down REAL hard on Clipper, using a
warning from Thomas Jefferson.

I think the they're getting the idea.
