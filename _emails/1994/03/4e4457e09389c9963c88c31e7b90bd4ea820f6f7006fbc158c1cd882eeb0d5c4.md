I have to admit that PEM's RSN availability against PGP 2.X's 20+ months
of worldwide availability has made me not keep up with PEM and the
latest hierarchical, government controlled certification process...

But is there an intrinsic problem with a PGP-style web of trust for
remote telnet/rlogin applications. I really don't expect to login to
arbitrary nodes on the net, but is that required? or simply a robust way
(SecureID in software?) Maybe PCMCIA cards with PGP once desktop systems
have them.

If i'm cluelessly missing something essential, please email me the news.

Thanks
Pat
