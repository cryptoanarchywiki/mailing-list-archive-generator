I disagree, and below you disprove yourself.

Indeed, just as a check.

Right: maybe more, maybe less.  The global monetary system is not
based on immutable metals prices.  You cannot guarantee that gold will
track the inflation of the dollar, which itself can only be measured
relative to other currencies.  Even during times of widespread
inflation, some things don't track; if you bought a diginote in 1978
and insited that it be issued in terms of a quantity of 8K RAM chips,
you'd be holding something pretty much worthless today.  (Then again,
8K RAMs might hold historical value :-)

The exact same relationship holds whether the digicash is issued on a
base of Swiss Francs, Mexican Pesos, or pet rocks.  Everything floats.
I really can't think of a way of anchoring the at-issue-time "value"
of a digicash note that's not either ridiculous or pointless.

Investing in gold at any given time may or may not be wiser or safer
than investing in dollars.  Your example fails.
