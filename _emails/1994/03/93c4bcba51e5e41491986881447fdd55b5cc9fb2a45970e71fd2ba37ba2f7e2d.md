Even if the normal parts of the Bush and Clinton Administrations are
equally fascist, the Clinton Administration would win in net
fascism since it includes an added (unelected) fascist element
missing from the Bush administration: 

Linda Stasi reports in her column "Hot Copy" in the New York Daily
News today (Tuesday, March 1, 1994) that she and some other gossip
columnists were invited to have tea with Hillary Clinton yesterday.

[Hillary was in town to boost her health care program with a visit to a
very recently improved Kings County Hospital.  The units Hillary visited
were specially scrubbed for her visit and contained fewer patients than
usual.]

Linda says Hillary "...never wants to run for public office herself.  But
she'd probably get elected in a minute."  Think again Linda.  You also
provided us with another one of those `Hillary's Ominous Quotes of the 
Day':

"AT A CERTAIN POINT, YOUR RIGHTS MUST BE ABRIDGED FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD."

The statement might simply be her response to a question about convicted
rapists not having to submit to an AIDS test.

And then again, it might not.
