Actually that was a series of CPSR FOIA requests dating back to 1992. EFF 
(except for some done by Bd. Member John Gilmore) does not do FOIA.


There are fudging seriously on the 91 figure. They admit that none of them 
have to do with digital telephony. At least 10 were from NY in the mid-80s 
when everyone wanted a cell phone and there wernt enough ports for the FBI to 
wiretaps them all at the same time. That situation has been remedied. Another 
30 of them were when they could not slap a pen register on a cell phone 
(actually nothing to do with taps at all really). and so on. After Freeh 
mentioned the 9 figure, Leahy really took him apart on the figures.
