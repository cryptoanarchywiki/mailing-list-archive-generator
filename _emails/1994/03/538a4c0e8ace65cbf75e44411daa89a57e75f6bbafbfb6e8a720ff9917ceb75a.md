I've read many books about the intellignence establishment, including
some that deal at length with foreign (non-U.S., that is) intelligence
agencies and their practices. Most folks on this list have never heard
of Chobetsu or the BND.

My point? These books are freely available and the authors know a
thousand times what we know about these things...and yet they aren't
facing espionage charges. So, discuss away!
