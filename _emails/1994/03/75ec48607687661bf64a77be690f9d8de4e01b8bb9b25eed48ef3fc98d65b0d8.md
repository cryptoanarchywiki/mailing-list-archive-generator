Howdy Stanton,

I'm going to see Thomas M. Hoenig, Federal Reserve Bankf Kansas City
President, (1 of 12 in the US), in a public forum Tuesday, 5 April.
I need a crash course in encryption privacy for credit card use and
digitized financial transactions.  Given the opportunity to ask a
pointed question or two in a room full of people, I'll have about 3
minutes to gain a room full of converts, and perhaps Hoenig.

I have to be polished and precise.  Please help.

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
