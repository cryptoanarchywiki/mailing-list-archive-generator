There will be a meeting of the Boston Area Cypherpunks on Saturday,
March 12, 1994 in MIT Room 1-115 starting at 3pm EST.  The plan is
to have an audio link to the other cypherpunks meetings around the
country and around the world.

The title for this meeting is: Politics, Strategies, and Action

All further announcements about the Boston Area meeting will be made
on the mailing list "cypherpunks-east@MIT.EDU".  (Send sub/unsub
requests to cypherpunks-east-request)

Directions to MIT 1-115:

Via T: Get off at Kendall, on the Red Line.  Walk away from the
marriott hotel, and walk until the street dead ends at Amhust.  Take a
right, and then keep walking.  Follow the path across Ames street, and
keep walking past the Great Sail, and when the path splits, take the
45-degree right path.  Keep walking until you reach the steps into the
building, and go in.  Walk to the other end of the corridor.  You will
be in a large cathedral-like lobby (lobby 7) in front of 77 Mass Ave.
Follow the signs for 1-115 from here.

Via Bus: Take route 1 to 77 Mass ave and follow the signs 

Via Car: Drive to Cambridge.  MIT building 1 is on the corner of Mass
Ave. and Mem Drive, slightly south of 77 Mass Ave.  Find a place to
park, and enter the building from Mass Ave.  Follow the signs to room
