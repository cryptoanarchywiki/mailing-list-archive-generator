I was curious about that, too, but found out that the NSA declared it to
be exportable.  Note that there is no requirement that exportable crypto
be marked as such.  I've looked at the stuff in the book, and determined
that I could probably crack most of it if I cared enough and had a fast
computer.  I also found that the author made a mistake in implementation
that could cause some messages to not decrypt even if you have the right
key, if you have a different brand of math coprocessor than the sender
had.
