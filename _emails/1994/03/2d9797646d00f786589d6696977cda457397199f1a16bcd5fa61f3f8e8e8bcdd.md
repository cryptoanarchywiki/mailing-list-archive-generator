I really think this project is a serious mistake. People should, if
they insist, produce software compatible with the draft RFCs on telnet
encryption and authentication -- although such code has already been
written. The notion of putting in all this effort just to avoid having
to deal with your system administrator, especially when he should be
happy to install such code given the recent rash of internet breakins,
seems misplaced to me.
