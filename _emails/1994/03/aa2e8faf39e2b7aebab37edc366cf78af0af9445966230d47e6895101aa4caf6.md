On the other hand, with
1. the right algorithms for multiple precision arithmetic
2. a little assembler code for time critical sections
3. reasonable hardware (say an intel 486DX/33. Nothing 'state of the art')

encryption, decryption, signing &c. with a 2048 bit modulus can be 
quite practical (or at least tolerable).

But yes, it does increase computation time considerably, so one has 
to be a lot more careful about how one does things if RSA is still 
going to be practical.

Can you afford to wait 15 seconds to sign a message? What is the time 
limit for us to consider RSA practical?
