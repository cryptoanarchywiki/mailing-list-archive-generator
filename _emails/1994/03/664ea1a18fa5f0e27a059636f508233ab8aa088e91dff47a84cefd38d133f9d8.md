It just came to mind about a funny stego (usage) thread in an
in-company newsgroup at a company I was contracting at.

They were 'downsizing' and planning on laying off a fairly large
percentage of people.  There was a discussion obliquely related in one
of the local talk groups.

The seemingly related messages all furthered the point in a diplomatic
way, except the first letter of each line spelled a more direct
statement.  (JERKS, SUCKS, ...)

It was pretty funny, especially when people responded to the
ostensible message and then later found out about the stego one.

One person started it and those that noticed followed up likewise.
