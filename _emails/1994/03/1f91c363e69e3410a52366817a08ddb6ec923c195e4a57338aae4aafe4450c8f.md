Richelson, Jeffrey T.  _The U.S. Intelligence Community_.  2nd ed.  Harper,
New York.  1989.  ISBN 0-88730-226-2.  This book is a required text for at
least one class at George Washington University and can be found in their
bookstore in D.C.  I would imagine the book is still in print and could be
ordered if not found in your local (well-stocked) bookstore.
