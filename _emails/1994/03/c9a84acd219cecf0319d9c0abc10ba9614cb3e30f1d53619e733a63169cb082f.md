	Ah, Tim, err, Brad was on our side here pal 8)  Vonnegut
	had a neat little thing making the previous "Because
	children read furom, I agree that abscene language should
	be banned.." quote look stoooooopid.  I also think it was
	"Palm Sunday"  not Psalm.  8)

	That was a damn good skit that Carlin did, almost as good
	as the thing he does about politically correct terms 8)

	No, it was simply a misinerpretation, and misattribution.
	Noe Brad said whoever didnt find that quote "Because
	Children....." obscene should rad the Vonnegut thing,
	snce they would actually find the quote calling for
	censoring obscene itself.

	OH NONONONO, Kurt doesnt support censorship at all, and
	his commentary on it is quite enlightening.  Do you think
	the guy who wrote about seeing the bodies of young school
	girls boiled in the water tower at Dresden would support
	censorship, or the guy who wrote _Breakfast Of Champions_
	with various ridiculously funny hand drawn pictures of
	anatomy etc..., or the guy who discovered that the main
	reason we have wars is for women's underwear 8)    
	Dont worry Tim, we realize it was only a misattribution
	most likely do to the often confusing format that some
	people do their quotes in 8)
