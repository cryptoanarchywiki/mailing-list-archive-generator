Sorry to bring the list back to cryptography, but there's now a new
version of Privtool (PGP-aware mailer for Xview) on ftp.c2.org in
/pub/privtool/privtool-0.83.tar.Z. This version has two major fixes which
greatly improve performance and reduce memory usage, along with a number
of minor fixes. 

In the next few days I'll upload it to ftp.dsi.unimi.it and update the
on-line documentation on my WWW site. 

			Mark

P.S. No, it doesn't support MIME.
