It has been my belief that there isn't an effective way for me to use PGP, 
but with all the hubbub, I thought it might be worthwhile to verify this.

My internet access is through a personal account provided by my employer. 
It is on a machine used exclusively by employees of the University of
Illinois (no student accounts). 

My primary access to this account is through my IBM xt (dos 3.3) at work. 
This machine is occasionally used by others and is outside of my control. 
I also use many of the public access Win/Mac machines on campus. 
I have no pc of my very own.


Is there an effective way for me to use PGP?
