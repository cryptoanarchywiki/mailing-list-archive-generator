I remember the product, including the test strip printed in BYTE that
caused a flurry of "what's this?" letters.  I'm sure Tim is right about
very few readers being sold.  But I think that 2 other things
influenced the Cauzin's demise.  There was the steady drop in magnetic
media prices that eroded the potential savings in storage on paper.  But
I think the more important event was that Cauzin was bought by Kodak.
This was at a time when Kodak was getting into mag media pretty heavily
(both computer disks and video tape).  I always sort of assumed Kodak
bought Cauzin to rid themselves of some competition.
