So, you just want a generic overlay (wrapper) to any of the existing 
encryption algorithms?  Is this correct?

Well, it sounds good in theory.  However, trust me, Todd, writing a generic 
API that is multi-platfomr is not necessarily as easy as it sounds.  There's 
alot of code in this prioject.  You would also have to make sure that the API 
is generic so it could work in ANY program that might use encryption or 
digital signatures.  (i.e. e-mail, USENET news, possibly even lending itself 
to a Secure HTTP implementation.)

>(key management would be done on the basis of the method specified.)

Uh, just from a first glance, I'd say that this is going to slip gently into 
the ITAR pits.  There are very few "methods" other than RSAREF that you could 
use to make this "universal".  Also, would this act as a wrapper over PGP, or 
would it use the same concepts (and or code) to do the same things?

Agreed, it would be nice to have one API.  As a developer though, I panic when 
I see "generic" API's.  Usually, they are not as "black-box" as people would 
like to believe.  What I mean is, usually they are not just as simple as "put 
in this input, and you will get this output."  Also, are we talking about C 
code or C++ code?  DOS? Windows?  Are we talking multi-platform code that will 
work on all the major OS's?  For a generic API, that's alot of code...I keep 
saying that....must mean something.

I would be interested in seeing something like this implemented, but I 
question whether it will be a hit as an industry standard.  Generic API's 
really haven't gone over well for things in the past.  (Except the class 
libraries for major C++ compilers.  MFC, OWL, etc.)
The design has to be robust before you start coding.  

Anyone else have any comments?
