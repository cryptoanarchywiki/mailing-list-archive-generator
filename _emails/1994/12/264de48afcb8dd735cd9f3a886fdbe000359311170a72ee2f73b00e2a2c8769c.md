|    The problem is that although you can protect the data file of
|    hashes (by using a pass phrase to encrypt it), protecting the
|    binary which does the checking is rather more difficult.

| Why not recompile the binary?  All it needs to be is something like
| md5.c.

	Or leave the binary on a floppy (assuming you can access
floppies, or some other removable media.)  The problem reduces pretty
quickly to a variant of trusting trust.  root can hack the kernel, the
math libraries, your shell, or several other points to make life
difficult.  Can you go through a set of steps so convoluted as to
catch this?  Probably.  But in all likelyhood, its easier to get a
personal machine on which to store private files.
