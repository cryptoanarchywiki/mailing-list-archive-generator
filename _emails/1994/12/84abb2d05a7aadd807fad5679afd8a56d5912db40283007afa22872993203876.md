	Seems to me that the UNIX model of building one mail transport
instead of 20 is a good one.  If you seperate out the UA from the
transport, you make it easy to fix or update the transport.

	So I would suggest, rather than hacking at Winsock and
hoping to catch the right protocols, build a set of libraries that can
be called by programs.  smtp.dll, for example, would be a mailer that
any mail program could call.  nntp.dll would handle news, underneath
all the various interfaces.  If you want to pretend to be premail, you
do it in smtp.dll.

	The advantage to other programmers is that they no longer have
to do the low level stuff that they had to before.  It allows
programmers build whats interesting, namely, the interface & gizmos.

	Make the package do the user interface side of things, and
make a seperate package to do the network protocols.  Makes building,
testing, and changing things a lot easier.  And while you're at it,
store all of your files as text.  :)
