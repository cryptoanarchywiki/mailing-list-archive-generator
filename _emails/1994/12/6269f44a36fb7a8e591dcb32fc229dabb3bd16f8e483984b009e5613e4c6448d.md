No offense, but what's the point?  What's next, automated key-signing
services?  Is this just intended to help people who can't sign easily
to get around Eric's proposed requirement?  If so, it seems like almost
an embarrassment--someone setting up a meaningless message signer to
spoof the cypherpunk server, which it does easily.  Doesn't sound too
good to me.
