but is a remailer (or pgp) smart enough to take the output from checking
a signature and run pgp over it again?  is it going to know to take something
and pass it through pgp until pgp can't do anything with it any more? i think
that's the problem that jrochkin was addressing.  he has a pgp encrypted
message and then signs it and then wants to mail it to a remailer so that the
remailer can decrypt the message but it won't ecause the encryption is
nested...

wasn't that it?
