I have managed to obtain this file, and have placed at the gopher
site.

Now, chaos.bsu.edu has recently moved to chaos.taylored.com, which is
still a "host unknown" for me.  But, using its ip address works just
fine "gopher 204.95.228.28".  Actually, "gopher chaos.bsu.edu" still
works for me, but this is supposed to change by January...

Anyway, the file in the Essays directory as "Crypto Anarchy and
Virtual Communities".

One (or more) of the following should work:

gopher://chaos.taylored.com/Cypherpunks Gopher Server/
gopher://204.95.228.28/Cypherpunks Gopher Server/
gopher://chaos.bsu.edu/Cypherpunks Gopher Server/

and then look in

Essays/Crypto Anarchy and Virtual Communities
