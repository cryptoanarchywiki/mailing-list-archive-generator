I tried out a freenet system once.  You could not create files with
arbitrary contents.  There was a facility for setting up mail forwarding,
but it was all done via a menu-driven system where you specified the
email address to which your mail should be forwarded.  The system really
did not seem to have enough flexibility for procmail.
