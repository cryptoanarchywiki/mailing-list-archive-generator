Like phone calls are really that secure what with people using cordless 
and cellular phones that still transmit in the clear even with Congress' 
best efforts to grant a false sense of security by outlawing some types 
of scanners.

If you have to call, what would be the difference between this and normal 
mail order save tha the catalog is digital?  That's not a significant 
enough of a change to have it considered a new form of commerce.
