Schneier's examples are meant to be instructional in nature rather than
practical, showing how it would be done with paper envelopes and such.
The only example he has which is cryptographic is the "off-line" version
where Alice's identity is encoded in the cash in such a way that it is
revealed if she double-spends.  Chaum's off-line protocol also relies on
cut and choose for this (Chaum, Fiat, Naor, Crypto 88).  That is the
major improvement in Brands' scheme, that you don't have to use cut and
choose for his off-line cash system.
