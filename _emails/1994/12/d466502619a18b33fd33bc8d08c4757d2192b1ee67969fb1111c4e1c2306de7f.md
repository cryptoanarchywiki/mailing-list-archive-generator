Wonderful, thanks. That is exactly what I was looking for. I forgot the name of
the program.

BTW, remailer@nately and mixmaster@nately will be down till tomorrow morning
because we yanked the thicknet connection out of our Ethernet repeater. Lets
see a hacker get through THAT security ;)
No messages will be lost. They should be back up around 11:00 AM PST tomorrow.
To spare you other remailer operators out there a flood of messages, I turned
off my pinging scripts ;)
