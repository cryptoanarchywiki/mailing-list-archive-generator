Assuming that thing that you're "cobbling together" is based on a
reasonably robust database engine, it should scale a long, long way. 
Basically all you need is a set of three-part records:  account-id,
cumulative amount, and timestamp of oldest transaction.  (You might want
a fourth field that gives all the purchasing details as text, if your
services sells a range of different kinds of things).  Any good
commercial db system should be able to handle a LOT of such records.

This goes back to the two kinds of anonymity that you so usefully
defined in your earlier message.  These small transactions would have
counterparty anonymity -- all that the seller knows is your first
virtual id, which is essentially a user-chosen pseudonym -- but not
issuer anonymity.

No, you're just confused.  Our charges have not changed, this is what
they've always been.  Probably our materials weren't clear enough
somewhere, in which case I apologize.

> Partial security is better than no security.

That's a *very* interesting statement.  I'm not at all sure what it
means, so I'm not sure if I believe it or not.  Sometimes partial
security is worse than no security because it gives people a false
*sense* of security.  (People who know their email is going in the clear
are likely to be more prudent than people who believe their email is
"encrypted" even though the encryption algorithm might be a very poor
one.  I've even known people to pass real secrets around using rot13,
amazingly enough.  People can be quite naive.)

This is a very good point.  It is one that is often missed in analyses
of digital banks, in particular, where the consequences of compromising
the bank's keys are often not sufficiently considered.

This is exactly the way we would expect to use crypto layered on top of
First Virtual's protocols, if and when such cryptographic protocols are
deployed widely enough to have penetrated af meaningful portion of our
market.  -- Nathaniel
