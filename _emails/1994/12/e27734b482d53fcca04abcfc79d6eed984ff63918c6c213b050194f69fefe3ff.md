The sys admin can change the kernel running on your machine.  A special
kernel can be built so that when a particular user is typing on a tty
and the executing process is named "pgp" then all keystrokes they type
are recorded into a file for the administrator to read later on.

The local machine must be part of the trusted computing base.
