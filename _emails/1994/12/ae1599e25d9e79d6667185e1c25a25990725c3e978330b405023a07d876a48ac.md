I percieve a 'chilling effect' going on with PGP compatible application development.  Nobody wants to extract the core PGP code into a library because the code is dense and who wants to do that every update?  Likewise with using PGPTools.  Who wants to re
write their application when the official PGP library materializes?  So people are waiting...

Could we get some updates on what is happening with the official pgp development?  If it's not coming soon, or not at all, it would be nice to know so we can get going on improving PGPTools or writing our own.
