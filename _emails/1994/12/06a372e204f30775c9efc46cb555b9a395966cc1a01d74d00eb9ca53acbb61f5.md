It could also be because they've made an investment in custom hardware
to "crack" RC4 by justifying it in terms of the volume which will result
from the special export status, whereas the volume of sapphire use they are
expecting is lower and so they'll be using off-the-shelf systems to
decrypt any streams seen from it.
