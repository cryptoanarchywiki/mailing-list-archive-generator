Sorry to divert everyone from the other threads, but I happen to have some
somewhat crypto-related question:

Back some time ago, there was some discussion of giving away disks at Comdex
in NY; by any chance, does anyone have a copy of the contents of what was on
those disks?  I'd like to be able to give away 'basic info' in
easy-to-handle format :-)

Thank for any help/pointers.

We return you now to your regular mailing list.....
