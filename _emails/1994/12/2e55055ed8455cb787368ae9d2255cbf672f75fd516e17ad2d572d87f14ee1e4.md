The folks from DigiCash are demonstrating Ecash, smartcard payment systems,
and other goodies at the Cardtech West exhibition in the Santa Clara
convention center. Today, Thursday, is the last day of the show, so get on
out there. The show will be open from 10 am through 3 pm. No, Chaum himself
won't be there.
