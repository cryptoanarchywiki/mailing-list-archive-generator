-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The error you mentioned is not my problem. I got the fix when I got PGPTools.
I would really like you to look at the code I am using.
Do you still have access to a Linux box? 

This communication with you using public groups and lists is a waste of bandwidth,
and very slow. Could you send me an anonymous reply block? It is going to take forever
for you to guess what my problem is without being able to look at the code directly,
and I do not want to post the whole thing to cypherpunks.
