I'm a Mac user.

MacPGP is a general nightmare.  For those of us who have shell accounts, 
it is such a annoyance as to cause me to dislike using it at all except for
the most extreme messages.

I fear I am not of the ability, or of the spare time to work on making a 
seamless application myself or else it surely would have been a project 
on the top of my list.

PGP needs to be a drop and drag application.  I want a box sitting on my 
desktop, a box I can drag any document to and press two buttons after a 
mouse click and drag and encrypt/decrypt/sign a message which can then be 
copy/pasted to Zterm.  Currently the only thing that nears the 
transparancy of this sort of thing is the bulky, annoying, poorly 
packaged and massively oversized, not to mention rarely working, MacPGP 
Kit.  It doesn't seem to work out to any time advantage when I factor in 
the debugging and outright code crashes into my computation.

The modular PGP project has been out there for almost a year.  Any 
progress on this front?  Does anyone care?

Now that some lists are beginning to delay or reject unsigned messages 
altogether, I would really like to be able to reply to a simple note in 
less than the 7 minutes it currently takes me.

This is the single most problematic hitch in PGP.  It's not easy to use, 
to install, or to apply.

Every move toward transparent crypto simply serves to increase user base 
and deter a prospective ban.  It should be in EVERYONE's interest to try 
and push for a easier front end, while still allowing a flexible and 
detailed set of advanced options for the expert user.

Curve Encrypt is a classic example of simplicty and ease.  PGP front end 
designers for the Mac should take its example.
