A concrete basis for comment.

I post about 4 messages a day to the Cypherpunks list. Many others
post less than 1 per day, some only 1 every week or so. (And so on.)

Effects on Active Posters (4 or so per day): 4 x 15 seconds = 1 minute
after the first day = 30 minutes after the first month  = 3 hours
after the first 6 months = 6 hours after the first year

(Double these numbers if the "30 seconds" figure is used.)

Effects on Casual Posters: 2 per week x 15 seconds = 30 seconds after
the first week = 2 minutes after the first month = 24 minutes after
the first year


Pretty clearly, casual posters would not be significantly affected,
while active posters would be.

The desired intent? I doubt it. But typical of mechanistic attempts to
modify behavior. (Yes, seen on the Extropians list.)
