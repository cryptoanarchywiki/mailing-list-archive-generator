>> From: Dave Mandl:

Could you send me some powerful handguns and silencers?  Oh, 
and while you're at it, give me all of your addresses and 
precise  travel schedules for the next two weeks.  As an 
"amoralist," I'm sure you won't put short term morality before 
my long-term goal.  Thanks.

>From Uni:

I fear what you request would probably violate many laws.  
Providing you with weaponry has little to do with providing you 
the information you might need to obtain and modify such 
weapons as you will need.
.........................................................

Uni, if the laws did not reflect your own moral stand regarding 
the uses of technology, would you nevertheless not have any 
personal thoughts at all on the matter?   Laws come from the 
mind of mankind,  you know, not vice versa.  (Unless, of 
course, one is mindless and absolutely needs someone else's 
decisions to guide their moral reasoning.)
