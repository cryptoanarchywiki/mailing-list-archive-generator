FV does in fact have a bunch of e-mail addresses that will auto-forward some  
info sheets to you.  I have attached the info to this message.

After having read Doug Barnes message (<9412021548.AA17294@tadpole>) I'm glad  
I'm not the only one who thinks FV is a joke.  The entire security of the  
system rests on the difficulty of intercepting and forging e-mail.  Forging  
e-mail is dead easy, intercepting isn't much harder.  While the implementors  
are correct that an online payment-system will have to be simple to use in  
order to gain wide acceptance, sacrificing all security for ease of use is a  
grave mistake.  It just begging to be ripped off, providing people actually  
sell something via FV worth ripping off.
