I think you may have jumped to a conclusion here that is unwarranted. We are a
small company with limited experience and capacity. We did what we thought was
appropriate, however it may seem now.

True. However, we have found a way to get it to the masses quickly. System
software is inherently more difficult to distribute, and consequently takes
more time. When I was doing operating system work at SGI, it was often a year
before the customer base would see the fruits of my labor. However, with
Netscape, things are faster and it is easier to get people to load an
"application" than it is to load a new winsock/kernel. The delivery vehicle is
very important to  the marketplace.

In my mind, SSL and IPSP are two solutions with very similar properties.
However, SSL can be implemented at the application layer. I'm not certain if
IPSP can, and I'm also not certain that if it could, people would be as happy
with it.

A (probably naive) question: If IPSP is essentially "tunnelling", don't
sysadmin's and the like get concerned that now their fancy routers etc. can no
longer shield certain classes of unwanted traffic?

These are all good properties. As with any technology, it takes time to deploy.
When these capabilities are the norm instead of the rarity, SSL will no longer
be needed, except as a compatability crutch.
