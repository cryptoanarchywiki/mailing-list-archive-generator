Hey, don't kid yourself! I have read comments to the extent that anon remailers
like the cypherpunks system should be BANNED! Seriously....another good reason
for putting more in Europe if possible.

Here's an idea. Someone mentioned trying to set up an anon remailer on the
North American Freenets, but it seemed there were software compatibility
problems.

Well, if we could solve the problem, assuming the Freenets in Europe use the
same software, we could set a few up in Europe ourselves from this side of the
pond. You could telnet into a Euro-Freenet (although some like Helsinki had
restrictions on members being citizens of the country) establish an account
and then e-mail the software to your account overseas.

Would this be practical? Sounds like it would be worth a shot. But again, I
guess it comes down to the software compatibility problem.
