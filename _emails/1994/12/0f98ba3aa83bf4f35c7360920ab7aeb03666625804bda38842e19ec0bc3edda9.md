I just joined this list last week, I may have been greviously mistaken, 
but I thought that this list talked about technical issues of being a 
cypherpunk.  It seems to me that most of the things posted here belong is 
a newsgroup rather than in my mailbox.  So I guess the question is:
Is there a cypherpunk newsgroup, and if there isn't why?  I am not 
complaining so much about the content, but I get so many mail messages 
about things that I would just as soon miss in my mail box that I have a 
hard time finding the messages that I do want.  Just a thought. . . . 

Hey and is there some sort of FAQ?
