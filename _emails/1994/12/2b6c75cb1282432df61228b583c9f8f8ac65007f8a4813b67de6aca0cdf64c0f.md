In the beginning there was nothing. Then John Young said:

Yeah, I'm getting really fucking sick of it. This is about the dozenth
copy of this silly thing I've received from various sources. As far as
I'm concerned, the only 'virus' we have to worry about is the
unrelenting propogation of that damn message.

Has anyone actually seen this 'Good Times' thing? I highly doubt
it. And seriously, an e-mail virus? Get real.
