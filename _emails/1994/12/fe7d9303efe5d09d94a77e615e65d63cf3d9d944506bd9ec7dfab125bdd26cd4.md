I expect it will be a remailer-friendly site - the other two guys are even
less computer-literate than I am, so I get to be the IS Manager :-/
If the NT-based tools were available, I'd be agreeable (even enthusiastic)
about setting up "independent" remailers on it (ie, Tim's Remailer-in-a-box
[my box, but what the heck :-]). We're looking at calling the site
genisys.net, so additional remailers could be remailer@vogon.com,
remailer@flatulnt.com, or whatever. Hell, if all folks wanted was a
remailer, I might even be convinced to offer remailer-only accounts at a
discount :-)
I'm still looking into what kind of magic I need to invoke to get it to all
happen in the right order (IP address, then register the domain, do them in
parallel, or ???. Any rules/restrictions on what we can call our site (we'll
be incorporated, but can we call the site ???.net/org/???], etc.).

ObQuestion: whyfor isn't toad set up so that the default reply-to address is
the CP list, vice the originator?

Recycled signature follows for the benefit of the toad (easier to recycle
them than do them from scratch on a plain-Windows box)
