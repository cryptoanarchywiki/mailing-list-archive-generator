From the recent essay "Anarchy" by T.C. May:

    The use of encryption by "evil" groups, such as 
    child pornographers, terrorists, abortionists, abor-
    tion protestors, etc., is cited by those who wish to 
    limit civilian access to crypto tools. We call these the 
    "Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse", as they are so 
    often cited as the reason why ordinary citizen-units 
    of the nation-state are not to have access to crypto.

A problem with the Four Horsemen is the various definitions
currently in use on the Net. Two of them are generally agreed 
upon: Drug Dealer and Terrorist. Usually either Pedophile or 
Pornographer is the third. The fourth varies the most: Tax
Evader, Spy etc. Abortionist and Abortionist-Killer are new
prospects.

Who were the Original Four? (No, I'm not asking about White,
Red, Black and Pale.)
