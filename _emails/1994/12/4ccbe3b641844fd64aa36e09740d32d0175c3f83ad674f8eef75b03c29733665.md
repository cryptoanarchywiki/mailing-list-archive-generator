No.

Both methods are valuable.

Netscape has provided a screwdriver.  People are screaming at
them for not producing a hammer.  They are planning the hammer
later.

We do not have to choose.  The more tools, the better.

The correct response is "Thanks, but what we really want
is a hammer."

Not "You stupid assholes, if you had the brains of a
turnip you would know that a screwdriver is THE WRONG
TOOL AND THE RIGHT TOOL IS A HAMMER, YOU HALF WITTED
MORONS."
