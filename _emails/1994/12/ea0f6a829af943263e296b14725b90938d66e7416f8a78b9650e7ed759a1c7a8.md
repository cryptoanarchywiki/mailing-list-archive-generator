I hope this is not the start of a trend toward meaningless signatures along
the lines I mentioned recently. Hal Finney, who commands more respect from me
than does anyone else on the list to date, has just started to PGP sign his
messages to the list. However, so far they haven't been signed with a key I've
been able to locate. AFAIK, he hasn't sent it to the list. Portal does not
accept external fingers. I requested "GET Finney" from one of the key servers
at MIT, but all I received was the remailer key I had before. Does someone
else have Hal's key ?  I could send him mail directly, but I'd prefer to get
the key from someone else if it's out there (to learn from my mistake), or
else raise this issue again if it's deliberately unavailable.
