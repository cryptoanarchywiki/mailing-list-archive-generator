This is all too familiar to me. Although I still haven't heard the official
line on the shutdown of Underdog following the Scythe spam, at least some 
people locally (including, crucially, my advisor) received the impression that
I had forged (and authored !) the offending news articles in spite of the
disclaimer headers.

Furthermore, the spam might not have been a fatal blow if not for the fact
that some people ignored the "complaints to <lmccarth@ducie.cs.umass.edu>" 
header and wrote directly to root or postmaster here. Everyone who actually
wrote to me came away satisfied that I was taking appropriate action, as 
far as I could tell.

I'll take this opportunity to reiterate that I'm no longer operating a 
remailer at this address. I wrote to Matt Ghio about a week ago asking him
to remove my address from remailer-pings@chaos.bsu.edu, but I suppose he's
busy with school these days. That list remains frozen with information 
dating from Nov.22. Karl Barrus mentioned something about chaos.bsu.edu
having moved to chaos.taylored.com; perhaps this is part of the reason for
the snag ?
