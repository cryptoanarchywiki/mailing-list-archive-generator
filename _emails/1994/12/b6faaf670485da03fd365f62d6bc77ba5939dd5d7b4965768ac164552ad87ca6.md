Well, for one thing you don't need a phone line in your scenario.  You
can probably just connect the serial port of your laptop to one of the
decstation serial ports, using a null-modem cable (pins 2 and 3 swapped;
4 jumpered to 5; 6, 8, and 20 jumpered to each other; and 7 passed
through, or something like that)

But I agree that the idea of buying a laptop so you can use PGP at work
is odious.  There must be a better way.
