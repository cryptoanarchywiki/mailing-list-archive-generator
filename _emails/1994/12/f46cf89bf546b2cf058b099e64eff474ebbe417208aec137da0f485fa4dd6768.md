   True.  And the fact is, monitoring any _one specific call_ is rather 
difficult to do without specialized equipment - in my experience with 
modified analog phones, one has to hop between 50 cells at the minimum 
before they can hope to monitor a specific call.  I've yet to obtain a 
digital cellphone to modify, but with the recent legislation about 
cellular phone monitoring, I wouldn't be surprised if it were more 
difficult to hack them.  (and just from the size of them alone, I would 
guess that they're mostly surface-mount, which is a pain in the arse for 
most people without elaborate facilities)

   Good analogy.
