The underlying problem is that in the DigiCash system money goes
through the shop into the bank, but there is currently no automatic
way for a shop to withdraw money (we might be able to hack one on
top of the text client, but haven't gotten around to it). So, what 
happens, is that the shop runs out of cash (or out of the right
size coins), even though it has a good-size bank balance. We've been 
trying to stay "cashed up", but interest in the poker game has been 
sporadic.

You are absolutely correct that various steps would need to be taken
in terms of error handling and dispute resolution if the e-cash was 
out of beta.

We are currently nicely cashed up, please try it again and see if
it is still not paying out (I'm stuck in a text-only environment 
at the moment.) Please send any error reports to me at:
