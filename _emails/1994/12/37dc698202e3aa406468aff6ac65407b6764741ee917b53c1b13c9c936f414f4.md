Could someone please elaborate on the foolishness of using PGP with a 
passphrase on a public machine (as I do) ?  Am I wrong in thinking that my
secret key is useless to an intruder until she guesses my passphrase ?  I
have no net access except via an account on a public machine, so I'm not
about to start storing my secret key elsewhere, but I'll change my passphrase
to <null> if it's irrelevant anyway.  I just reviewed the PGP docs a bit and
Phil says "Nobody can use your secret key file without this pass phrase.",
which seems to contradict what many people on the list have said.
