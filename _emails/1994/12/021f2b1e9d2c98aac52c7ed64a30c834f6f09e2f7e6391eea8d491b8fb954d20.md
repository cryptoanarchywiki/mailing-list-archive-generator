After much angst the following is up and running. Special thanks to
L. McCarthy and Sameer for the help. BTW-I've been having mail problems so
this may show up a few times...apologies in advance.

Welcome!! This is the PGP public key distribution mailing list. The purpose
of this list is to provide an easy and free method to distribute PGP public
keys. The sole purpose of this list is to distribute PGP public keys. Any
questions or problems with PGP should be posted in alt.security.pgp.

All keys posted to this list are channeled to three different sources:

        1) The subscribers of this list.
        2) The keyservers
        3) alt.security.keydist

Please note that you do not have to be a subscriber to the list to post to
the list. All messages addressed to pgp-public-keys@c2.org will be posted to
the list. Because of this please post only PGP PUBLIC KEYS.

The keyserver that this list posts to is a non-U.S.A. location. This is to
provide support for all versions of PGP.

A special note for users of AUTOPGP or similar utilities:

AUTOPGP has the ability to directly take keys out of a mail packet. This
feature coupled with this list can seamlesly update your key ring. To do
this.

        1) Subscribe to the list.
        2) Configure AUTOPGP to automatically update your key ring.
        3) Configure your offline mail reader to discard all message coming
           from the list.
