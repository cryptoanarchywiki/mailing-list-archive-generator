Responding to msg by Adam Shostack ( when bad things happen to 
good crypto):

	The technical reason to oppose GAK is that it adds points of  
failure to a crypto system which need not be there.  Those POF 
are not  adequately tied to the consequences of their actions 
(releasing a key  
improperly), and as such will be used as points to attack the  
integrity of the system.
...............................................................

And if there were no points of failure added by it, would you 
approve, agree, to its mandatory requirement?
