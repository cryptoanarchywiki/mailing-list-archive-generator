    It's my personal feeling that Netscape doesn't have the right talent mix to
    develop *any* Internet software, secure or not.

Well, I can't and won't attempt to speak to the overall mix of talent,
however I think that such a strong statement really needs to be
accompanied by some sort of an explanation.

For what it's worth, I have worked closely with one of the members of
Netscape's team and have continued to stay in touch with him over the
years since we worked together.  I'm quite confident of his stylistic
and technical abilities and I believe that he deserves better than the
unsubstantiated slam that you've delivered.

    Even Apple & Microsoft agree that Netscape is brain dead...

I'm assuming that you see agreement with Apple and/or Microsoft as a
positive.  That position is not universally held.

			Rick
