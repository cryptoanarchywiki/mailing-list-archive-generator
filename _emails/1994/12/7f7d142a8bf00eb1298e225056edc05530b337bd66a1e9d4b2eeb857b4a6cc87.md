Another, practical, problem with integrity checks (both signatures
and timestamps) for files on public archive servers is that the
receiver has to expect them and know how to verify them.  Current
ftp and www clients certainly don't have facilities to do this
automatically, and neither do users have reason to suspect foul
play if a timestamp or signature is missing for some file.  It's
somewhat analogous to the situation ten years ago when some nut
was lacing over-the-counter drugs with poison and putting the
packages back on the shelf.  The major drug companies responded by
including tamper-evident seals on their packages, but until consumers
learned to expect the seals, all the bad guys had to do was remove
the seal entirely before replacing the tainted packages.  In the short
term, given today's infrastructure, there's not a lot you can do.

Of course, in the medium- and long- term, the best solution is to
design good schemes and deploy them widely enough that people learn
to expect them.
