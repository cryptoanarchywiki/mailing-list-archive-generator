Good point.  However, the digital signature issue is still outside of what my 
topic was.  I agree with you wholeheartedly.  That's one of the reasons I 
don't sign everything.  That particular "argument" about digisigs has been 
pounded into the ground by the Cypherpunks for the last year and probably 
longer.

I just think (boy I feel repetitive) that there should be something inside the 
software so the user has the option to sign, or sign on the fly.  If I type up 
a message and think, "hey, I really want people to know this is from me", It 
would be really cool to just hit a button on the toolbar, or grab a menu 
option to sign automatically before sending.  You don't have to sign 
everything.  But, you don't have to go out to another application (of any 
sort) in order to sign.  It's right there in front of you.

That was my point.

On a personal machine, say at home, that's not really a problem.  On a 
computer at the office where everything is password protected, isn't really a 
problem either.  Since the situations I work with deal mainly with the home 
user, key management isn't as much a worry as if you're using workstations.

This issue has also been pounded into the ground.  Carrying a disk around with 
you is really the only way to guarantee security.  (Or memorizing your private 
key and typing it in every time.  EEEEERRRGGHHHH)  But, you are right.  It is 
a pain in the ass.
