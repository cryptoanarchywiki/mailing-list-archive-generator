Subject:
Question #1 to the community regarding National Cryptography Policy
  As many of you know, the National Research Council is
  undertaking a study of national cryptography policy
  (description available on request to CRYPTO@NAS.EDU).
  This note is the first of a number of questions that will
  be posted to the Internet community in our attempt to solicit
  input on a broad scale.  Please circulate this request to anyone
  that you think might be able to contribute.

  The question of this posting is the following:

  How, if at all, do capabilities enabled by new and emerging
  technology in telecommunications (e.g., key-escrow
  encryption technologies, digital telephony) and electronic
  networking make it _easier_ for those who control that
  technology to compromise and/or protect the interests of
  individual end users?  Please use as the standard of
  comparison the ease _today_ of compromising or
  protecting these interests.  We are interested in
  scenarios in which these interests might be compromised
  or protected both individually and on a large scale.  Please
  be sure to tell us the interests you believe are at stake.

  Please send your comments on this question
  to CRYPTO@NAS.EDU.
