In addition to this, the code really sucks as far as modularity goes.  The
next big version of PGP, which is supposed to include library hooks, etc.,
will probably not be out for five or six months.  I do know of some people
who are interested in working on a PGP compatible library of crypto code,
but I am not quite sure what the status of that project is at this time...
