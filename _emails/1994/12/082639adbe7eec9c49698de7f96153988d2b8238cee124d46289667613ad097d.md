   IPSP was not in my vocabulary at the time of the first posting. Ignorance
   was briefly bliss :^)

This indeed was exactly the problem.  Might I suggest that a some
amount of acknowledgement of the outside world and a survey of
existing work would solve most of Netscape's PR problems on this list?
