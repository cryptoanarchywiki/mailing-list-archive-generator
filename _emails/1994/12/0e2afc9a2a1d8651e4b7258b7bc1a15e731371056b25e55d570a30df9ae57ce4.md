Indeed. Let's examine some of the apparent misconceptions....

No, anyone with a moderately flexible newsreader and a little bit of 
knowledge about news control message syntax can cancel someone else's
article. Tying this in to the discussion about using a newsgroup as a
message pool, notice that news articles are far easier to wipe out than
mail messages. This is potentially a major vulnerability of any such
system, given current news software. Widespread unauthorized cancellations 
(other than for spam) are greatly frowned upon, though, so a concerted 
attack would probably set up a major clash of powers on the net.

mail forwarding =/= net access

True, but that's a claim about forgery, not remailing; this is a worrisome
confusion of terms reminiscent of the hacker/cracker problem.

One hopes that Internet Seminars pres. Sherman isn't responsible for the 
absurd implication I infer from this: sending mail via a geographically
distant site requires going out of one's way. Is there some more sensible
interpretation ?  It seems obvious that someone posting an article purporting
to emanate from the Canadian PM would try to transmit it with some level of
indirection.

Who's learning slimy politics from whom ?
