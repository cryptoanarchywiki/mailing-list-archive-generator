-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----


I've made a couple of changes to the format of outgoing messages that
should hopefully make life easier for readers.

The most noticable will be the movement of the blurb, but also very
significant is the removal of the "Reply-To: " (feh on the proliferation
of MUA behaviors) header, and way down on the "noticable" list is an
"Errors-To: " and a "Sender: " header.

Thanks for y'all's comments: keep 'em coming.
