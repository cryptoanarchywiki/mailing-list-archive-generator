I picked this up on the alt.2600 newsgroup.  Seems like it could be used
for things like privacy enhancement if it was coupled with a credit
card/cashier's check that wasn't in your name along with perhaps a call
back loop.

Ben.

THE BEST WAY TO SAVE ON INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE IS TO USE
			KALLBACK DIRECT

KALLBACK is the original "call-back" service provider.  Kallback was 
specifically designed to save international businesses and frequent 
travelers 40%-90% on their international long distance.

How it works is very simple.  When you subscribe to Kallback, you receive 
a personal "trigger number."  When you want to make an international 
call, dial your trigger number and hang up after the first ring.  The 
Kallback computer will then call you back with a US dial tone, so instead 
of paying the  local telephone company's rates, you are billed at 
Kallback's, which are among THE LOWEST IN THE WORLD.

Because no outgoing call is ever completed, our customers who call from 
hotels DON'T HAVE TO PAY HOTEL TELEPHONE SURCHARGES.

It doesn't matter where you need to make a call from, because your location 
number can be changed at any time.  You can have the Kallback 
computer ask for you by name, by room number or both. You can even 
program in touch tones, so Kallback will work with your automatic 
phone answering system. Kallback also supports modems and fax machines.


To give an idea of the savings you will see with Kallback, compare the 
rates you are paying now to the following:

TO THE UNITED STATES FROM(per min in $US):

Australia 	$ .52
Canada		  .23
France   	  .49
India		 1.06
Japan		  .78
Philippines	  .99
UK		  .36


Please feel free to call our 24 Hour Customer Service Department for more 
information.  We can mail via post, fax or email information. 
(Requests for information via fax usually have the quickest turnaround.) 
Please include in your information requests the countries you call from 
and to.
