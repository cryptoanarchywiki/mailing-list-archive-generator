As it happens, I'm a investor in Bob Fleming and Cherie Kushner's
start-up company. (One of several investors.) I've known them for
several years and have visited their lab/home many times.

(It was at their party that I got to spend a day talking to Vernor
Vinge, as some of you may recall me commenting on.)

So, I'd like to comment on some of these points.

Bob and Cherie _cringe_ when I joke about their loalizers being the
basis of the nation's "position escrow system." They fully understand
the ramifications and potential abuses of a system which could allow
position tracking to a few meters of every citizen-unit in a country.

(And a huge early market is expected to be "child localization," a la
the child-minder beacons some parents are already attaching to their
children. Bob and Cherie's system is much smaller, cheaper, etc.

This was an idea explored in detail by David Brin in 1990 in his novel
"Earth." Video cameras are ubiquitous and have a major effect on
casual street crime.

This scenario is a likely way that "position escrow" will evolve, from
a voluntary escrowing (incl. timestamping, etc.). "Those with nothing
to hide" will agree to escrow their movements...this will exculpate
them in suspected crimes, etc. A slippery slope.

On the topic of how these localizers actually work, I'm not at liberty
to talk about the technology. It's novel, and uses a *lot* if digital
signal processing. It doesn't use GPS and it's not a variant of
cellular telephones.
