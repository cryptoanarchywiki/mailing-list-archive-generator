The point is that if Eric insists on arbitrary rules that
threaten the list, some bright c'punk will "write code" to circumvent
the assinine rule. Use technology to solve problems...

But that is why a number of folks have posted that the rule
is at best ill conceived. Eric simply hasn't listented. Thus
the recent mini-flame war that again lowers the signal to noise ratio
on the list.

He wants the world to use encryption. So do I. But the tools
are not there for even the net-heads on this list. There is
nothing close to tools suitable for Joe Sixpack. Changing the
rules on c'punks won't change that.
