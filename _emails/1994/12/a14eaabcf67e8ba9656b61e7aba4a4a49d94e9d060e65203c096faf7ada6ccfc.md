I think the idea is that email sent to an anXXXXX@anon.penet.fi address will
be anonymized by the penet server, so you can establish a conversation
channel with MacGuru here without setting up a reply block through some
remailers. In some newsgroups where anonymous posting is common, listing of
several "anonymous" email addresses in .sigs is also common.
