True, I never want to foce people to use something, however an 
application so universily used such as e-mail would make a good place to 
present PGP and allow people to have access to it without downloading and 
compiling PGP for their selves, for each computer that uses PGP, ect. If 
PGP remains as obscure to thoes not intrested in crypto, then I think the 
program will not reach the people it is intented for, the masses. Not 
everyone knows how to compile a program, or has the intrest in it enough 
to read the docs that come with it to set it up. this is the reason I 
have not used it yet, beacuse of just getting it set up.
