II was quite surprised that they stayed that calm. MCOM's comming out on
the list was rather painfull. Glad to have them here, though. I always
looked at the list as  place to learn. Past mistakes nonwithstanding, they
do seem to be willing to learn.

There is nothing gained by flaming someone. Even if one thinks that they
deserve it. Let's not alienate people that come to us to be educated. This
would be self defeating.

C'punks, when this list started we were a bunch of idealistic privacy
freaks. Look who's on the list now: the developers of cutting edge Internet
software.

They came here because they heard our message. What did Amanda say?
Something like "I come here because that's where the ideas are". We have
the chance to influence the shape of the Net for years to come. The MCOM
folks didn't go to the IETF meeting? Send them an invite for the next one.
They never heard of ISIP? Send them a demo and docs. Let's show a "If you
have any questions don't hesitate to ask us." attitude.
