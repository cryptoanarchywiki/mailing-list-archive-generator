   Marvelous.  Regardless of licensing, if you were to look at the list 
of shops which accept DigiCash e-$, you'd notice that a fairly large 
number of them are in the United States.  

   (see http://www.digicash.nl/ecash/shops.html)

   The document I refer to (http://www.digicash.nl/ecash/trial.html) also 
states that attendees of a W3 conference in Chicago will receive $50.00 
in extra e-$.  This would seem to preclude US citizenship being a 
stumbling block to being in on the testing program.  Perhaps I'm just not 
3133+ enough.
