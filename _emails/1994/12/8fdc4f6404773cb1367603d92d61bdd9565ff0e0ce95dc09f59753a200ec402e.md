Person A requests information from Group C. 
Person B is a member of Group C.
Person B does not ignore Person A.
Person B does not speak with Person A.
Person B responds to Person A by addressing Group C.

Why?

If the last sentence I quoted is true, then why tell _us_ why he won't 
release the information.
