There is also the problem that a number of applications (such as Internet in 
a Box) require there own Winsock to make connections to the Internet. If you 
replace the Ibox winsock with another, when you run the programs they will 
no longer call the dialer to dial into the Internet. I believe the same 
holds true for Trumpet.
