Maybe the remailers should put bogus "From:" lines in, to avoid this?  Make
it "From: nobody", or "From: Anonymous", or even something odd like "From:
AnonUser!hfinney@shell.portal.com".  Put in some other lines telling the
actual address of the remailer, as well as a complaints-to: address. Maybe
"Sender: hfinney@shell.portal.com", or "Remailer:hfinney@shell.portal.com".


The "From:" line seems to be confusing people.  The author of the article
quoted from the Globe & Mail appearantly didn't even understand the
disclaimer. The article was worded in such a way to make it seem the
disclaimer was saying that Bob Rae didn't really write the message, as
opposed to saying that Hal Finney didn't really write the message!
Something needs to be done so that even the most internet clueless will
understand that the message _isn't_ from Finney or McCarthy or Joe Random
RemailerOp, which appearantly isn't clear to many people currently.
