Amanda wrote an interesting post.

I think if we only use MIME, the quality of discussion on the list
would skyrocket.  Eric, you should block all non-MIME posts to the
list.  How could we have been so blind?

<bold>I've <bold>come <bold>to <bold>rethink <bold>my <bold>position
<bold>on <bold>MIME.  <bold>It <bold>is <bold>definitely <bold>the
<bold>savior.  <bold>After <bold>all, <bold>this <bold>formatting
<bold>just <bold>has <bold>some <bold>extra <bold>stuff <bold>which
<bold>should <bold>be <bold>to <bold>hard <bold>to <bold>read
<bold>around.  <bold>Heck, <bold>I'm <bold>sure <bold>this <bold>is
<bold>so <bold>legible <bold>to <bold>everybody <bold>I <bold>may
<bold>launch <bold>into <bold>a <bold>mathematical <bold>explanation
<bold>of <bold>various <bold>public <bold>key <bold>cryptography
<bold>protocols.  <bold>Maybe <bold>even <bold>a <bold>few
<bold>dining <bold>cryptographers <bold>diagrams.

I think the MIME backers should do something that makes me want MIME.
Start posting such crucial diagrams and interesting formatted
documents, so that I feel like I'm losing something by not going to
MIME immediately.

I haven't really seen how MIME will enrich the discussion (and I use
that term loosely) here.  Crap like including a gif/jpeg of myself
with each post isn't exactly compelling.
