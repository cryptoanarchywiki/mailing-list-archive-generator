The moralistic rubbish in response to the Norton Encrypt post is just cover
for a surprising technical ignorance about the product among Cypherpunks
(myself included). Funny. We'd all have kept shut if the question was 
"I forgot my NE password. What do I do?"

Maybe we should stop discussing anonymous remailers lest they be put to
'amoral' use? I always thought the emphasis on this list was on _technological_
rather than _political_ or _legal_ or _moral_ means to protect privacy and
free expression - including the current limitations. The inevitability of 
technology confounding laws - BlackNet as the 'dark' aspect and "National 
borders are just speed bumps on the information superhighway" as the 'good' 
side.

That's what makes Cypherpunks different from comp.org.eff.talk and alt.privacy,
IMHO.
