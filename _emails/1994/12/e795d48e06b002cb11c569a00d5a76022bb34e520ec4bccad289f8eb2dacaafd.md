pgp is putting those extra "- " pieces in (guess you didn't read all
your pgp docs :-),  it does that so that it can tell the difference between
pgp begin/end blocks and other stuff, kinda like sendmail "quoting" lines
beginning with a dot with an extra dot.  the difference here is that
sendmail removes any leading dots before delivery and pgp doesn't after
removing a signature.  yeah, you do have to load it into an editor but
mailing something to a remailer shoud not "hork" it.  the pgp running on
the remailer will just "- " the stuff and include it literally.

follow?
