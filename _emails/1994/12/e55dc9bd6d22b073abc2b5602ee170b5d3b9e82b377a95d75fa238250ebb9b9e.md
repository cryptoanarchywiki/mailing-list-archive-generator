Here here!  I agree.  There are those who know, and to merely shut out 
all the expertise that might be on this mailing list is nonesense.  I 
think the pgp library approach is very interesting.  It could make pgp 
almost as common as winsock.  We know that there is vast interest in 
finding a good front-end for pgp.  The thing is, no one wants to dig 
around in code that utilizes poor modularity and try to flesh out an 
API.  Once 3.0 comes out, one could build an app under windows using a 
PGP v2.x DLL, and a newly made PGP v3 DLL that would handle all kinds of 
keyfiles, a one step option to convert keyfiles, etc...  I think the idea 
of writing a PGP DLL while the format will change in v3 of PGP is still 
feasable.  Just use it again for backwards compatability.  a PGWINP.EXE,
a PGPV2.DLL, and a PGPV3.DLL.  Or whatever.  I've only had experience in 
UN*X, and maybe I'm oversimplifying everything.  But, then again, what is 
ever simple when you have the trusty old 'windoze' GPF errors.  I much 
preferr the unix 'segmentation fault (core dumped)'.  Anyway, I will 
happily stand corrected on anything I say.  Remember, just an idea!
