The criticism was that the proposed use of the knowledge was wrong
-- not that the knowledge was wrong.

Then there was a larger debate -- is morality a threat to liberty,
or is coercion the only serious threat to liberty.

Now if you are eighteen or so, or if you have retarded emotional
development, the fact that it is real hard to get laid may seem
positive and powerful proof that morality is indeed a grave threat
to liberty.

But of course the fact that it is real hard to get laid is a result
of sociobiology, not of cultural values and morality.
