I believe there is a fundamental problem of understanding here -- it
does not seem that you understand how store and forward email
works. Securing just the transport is less than useless.

No, it does not -- it just means that some links can't be read. On the
other hand, PEM/MIME-PEM *ALREADY* keep people from reading no matter
whether the link is open or not open.

You don't have to replace any hardware. More ignorance on your part.

Each and every one routes it today. I have routed swIPe packets
over the commercial internet -- and of course I couldn't control any
of the intervening routers. Your comments indicate that you are
totally unaware of how IPSP is designed to work.

You are ignorant and foolish. You could at least read a document or
two before making statements that make you sound stupid. I read your
documents. You could at least read other peoples -- but that would
naturally require that you even realize that other people have done
work on this topic.

Yet Another Solution. Why not invent your own internet protocol? After
all, it would be a "solution".

Gee, I was under the impression that that was CODE, not SPEC.

What other way could you use?

Use DNS for key distribution. Use IPSP (soon to be standardized -- SSL
isn't standard either) for the packet layer. Use some variant of
Photuris for key distribution. All the software in question is
publically available or will be and will run on a wide variety of
platforms.
