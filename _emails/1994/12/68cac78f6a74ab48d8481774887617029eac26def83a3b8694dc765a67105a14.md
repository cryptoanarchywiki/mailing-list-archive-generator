Yes, they are supposed to be voluntary and created by the user in advance.
I don't want mandatory replyability, just to make conversation easier. As
for replies from a list or newsgroup, use the pigeonholes. Anonymous reply
is an enabling primitive for all kinds of servers and anonymous mechanisms.

Chaum's system isn't too different if the remailers generate new keys on a
regular basis. That would forcably expire reply tickets when the keys were
changed, whether they had been used or not.

True, outside traffic analysis is the major problem, as long as there are
enough hops to withstand a few bad remailers. Forward (source capture)
vulnerability is harder to stop.

Yes, but I actually want to build this thing. Fairly soon even.

Better is perhaps a three-day key with one overlap, that is, a current key
and one "last key" kept around at all times.

True, the path has to be there, or the message can't go. I can't think of a
fix for that one, can you? Mostly I just don't want an endlessly growing
amount of information out there. I want old information to die after a
while, as keys are erased or expired.

[ DH exchange / Key broadcast approach ]

Broadcasting a list of keys is one possibility; what if someone else uses
the same key? Birthday theorem makes this hard to prevent.

Pigeonhole holds a one-time reply address. Every week or two it expires and
you send a new one. If a mail comes in, it uses it, and you send a new one.

Methinks I'd make it a little more robust than the existing systems (easy
with perl) like being able to grep out a reply header anywhere in the
message, ignore > indentation, and similar safety precautions.

RSAREF is useful for public key and DH. Secret sharing we have to get for
ourselves. I looked at Shade v1.0, and it seems to be broken on
little-endian machines. It works on an HP-UX machine, but fails on a 
PC running linux with small-endian enabled in shade.h. The half-hour setup
delay is not encouraging, either. Your SECSPLIT is nice and simple, but each
shade is the size of the message. What I need is an error-correcting
protocol to build a no-growth secret splitter.

Yes, broadcast is the most secure, but it has a fundamental problem:
security scales linearly with bandwidth. If you have a pool of 100 users and
one of them gets a message, your uncertainty is 1 in 100. I've tried without
success to figure out a broadcast mechanism where security scales faster
than linearly with bandwidth.

Any system with a unique path is subject to an attack where each element of
the path is examined in turn. If the path forks and sends to several people,
the security is enhanced only to the extent that more people are annoyed.

We need a mechanism where there is either a circulating data stream or a
large file on a server. An incoming message alters the data somehow,
diffusing the changes over a large area. A request for information selects
out some transformation of the selected data in such a way that the server
cannot correlate the incoming message with the outgoing message. I don't see
any way to do this.

Elimination of the replay traffic-analysis problem is major progress. As for
step-by-step coercion back to the source, I don't see a fix, and we will
probably have to live with that unless there is a major breakthrough.
