Good grief! At >500 k, this is the longest 10% thread (SNR 1:10) I've seen 
in ages. Eric please go ahead and add the X-Bozo: header field, we can do
another in-depth study on its effects in 3 months, while Tim, you, and I 
figure out how to make digisigs convenient for ourselves.

(After all, Eric might not own the 'Cypherpunks list' whatever that is, but
he does own cypherpunks@toad.com; we could all move elsewhere, except that
despite a few crashes I've found this one especially reliable.)

In the meanwhile, could we get back to cryptography? There are so many 
interesting things happening out there - good earnest tough-on-crime
Congressmen waiting to sign HR 5199 (the Clipper Bill); the DigiCash trial;
the great voice-over-data protocols and products introduced by Intel, Rockwell,
ZyXEL and others at Comdex which will make Voice-PGP so much easier (ZyXEL
2864 does V.34 28.8kbps, voice, fax/data simultaneously, 230kbps DTE, parallel
port to print faxes on printer when computer is off, $350).

Now what _I_ want is some way to integrate PGP with Netscape...

ObEconomistPlug: British judges ruled against a Liberal Democrat Party request 
to re-run elections where the "Literal Democrats" won 10,000 votes. The new
Conversatives will target Tory seats next year. How about a good Cypherpunk
Senator ... from the Rebuplican party?
