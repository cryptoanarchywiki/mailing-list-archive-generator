You beat me to the post :(
I tested this out earlier today. I changed the system clock
and I got this:

Type bits/keyID    Date       User ID
pub  1024/BEB3ED71 1994/09/18 J.L.Francois <vamagus@delphi.com>
pub  2047/D9E1F2E9 1995/01/01 Francois, J.L <vamagus@delphi.com>

It works but take a lot more time, obviously, to generate the key.
