I'm confused. Isn't this precisely what I was saying in my post? That
if anyone really wanted it, it's easily and anonymously remailed?

I'm not saying no one wants it. As pedagogic material, with the text,
it's very useful. But it's not "productized" into a standaone,
runnable, item that a lot of people can use (like PGP, for example).

Which is what I said in my post.
