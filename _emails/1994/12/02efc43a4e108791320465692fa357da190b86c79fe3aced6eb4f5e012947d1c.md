UPDATE/PATCH OF *SECURE EDIT* for Mac
FROM a0.3.3 to a0.3.4

(AND MAILING LIST NOTICE)

There was a bug in Secure Edit a0.3.3 that would cause it to
crash when setting a default startup pass phrase on 68k macintoshes, but
not power macintoshes, which is what I was testing it on.

I was not planning to release any upgrades before a major update and
release in which I would overhaul most of the program, including changes
advised by Colin Plumb and others. However, I thought this was important
enough to release a patch.

I have uploaded a patch to upgrade a0.3.3 to a0.3.4, as well as a a0.3.4
package, to ripem.msu.edu in the directory /pub/crypt/mac. These correct
the bug. However, please save your work regularly as well as before using
this feature, just to be safe. I am overhauling much of the program
completely for the next release.

The method for verifying the default password has also been changed from
the previous "baroque" method. Now, it takes the MD5 hash of the key,
encrypts this hash on the key, and uses the first 8 bytes of the
resulting ciphertext to validate the default startup key.

Please report any problems/suggestions/improvements you may have
regarding Secure Edit.

Also, if you wish to be on a list of email addresses that will receive
information about Secure Edit updates or other Miyako Software 
releases, please send me an email to that effect. Anonymous IDs are,
of course, fine. No code will ever be sent by email. Actual programs and 
source code must be FTP'd from ripem.msu.edu
