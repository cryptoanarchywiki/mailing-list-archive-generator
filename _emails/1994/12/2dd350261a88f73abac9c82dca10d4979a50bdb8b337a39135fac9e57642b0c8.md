Hooray!!!

Kudos to Matt for actually posting something outside of the tiresome "Eric 
Hughes is a lame-o" thread!!!  (Which, by the way, I agree with Tim that it is 
a sign of health on the list.  I would also like to say that I'm not going to

I intend to read and comment accordingly on the MacGuffin document.

It's refreshing to see someone coding crypto.

Bruce Schneier and I have been designing a block cipher, called
"MacGuffin", based on a new variant of the standard Feistel (S-P)

entitled "The MacGuffin Block Cipher Algorithm", at the
Leuven crypto algorithms workshop later this month.  Here's the
abstract:

A forthcoming paper will discuss the characteristics GUFN structure
in more detail.

Comments and analysis greatly appreciated.
