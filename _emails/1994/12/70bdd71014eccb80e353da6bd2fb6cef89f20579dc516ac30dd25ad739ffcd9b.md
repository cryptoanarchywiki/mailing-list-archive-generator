I have the same type of shell account with Netcom that you have. However,
thanks to The Internet Adapter I turned that shell account into a SLIP
connection. If you have a shell account, you can convert it into a SLIP
account. It is as simple as that. Not that it mattered much for MIME email.
Eudora can handle that via dial-up just as well. Sure helps for browsers,
though. Accessing the web through Lynx is a joke. Even if you have image
loading turned off in the browser to conserve bandwidth, _anything_ is
better than Lynx.

Perhaps we can find some common ground here. You don't want to have to use
UNIX. You like your Mac, don't you? So why interact with a lousy terminal
server if you can do all the things you can do there - and more - the Mac
way? Think about it. All the benefits of a Mac interface without giving up
the benefits you get from Netcom. (No, I don't work for TIA. I am just a
VERY satisfied customer.)

Any of the mailers that you can use on a shell are oxen. Anything that can
be used over a VT100 emulator is an oxen. (At least where non-ASCII display
data is concerned).

You are fighting a lost cause and you know it. VT100 is dead. No, you are
not the last of your tribe. I should hope that you have the good sense to
come around before that happens. All your friends here sure hope for it.
