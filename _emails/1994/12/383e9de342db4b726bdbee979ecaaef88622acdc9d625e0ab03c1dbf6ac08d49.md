Actually, both interfaces are reasonable for the scope of this discussion.
I don't have specific goals in mind yet: I want to bounce around ideas before
coming up with something more specific.

The GSSAPI has the advantage that Kerberbos services have already been
provided for that API: There's no reason, however, that the two goals
need to be mutually exclusive.  

I'll have to read the GSSAPI doc carefully and get a sense of what problems
it solves.
