Netscape is seeking people to write this stuff, as we heard at the
last Cypherpunks meeting. So, this is the chance for Cyppherpunks to
see it done right.

I will speculate that Netscape, being a _very_ high-visibility
company, is in contact with the folks at RSA Data Security about this,
perhaps even using them to do the integration. (Recall that Bidzos is
involved in a couple of efforts along these lines.)

This doesn't mean they'll do it right, natch, but it gives us hope
that the crypto protocols will at least be well-handled.

(Ultra-speculative scenario: If I were the NSA/FBI/COMINT
establishment, anxious to ensure "escrowed access," Netscape is
something I'd be looking at. Ultra-speculatively, we should be on the
lookout for any evidence that Netscape will be deploying any kind of
"software key escrow" scheme, e.g., any links to the TIS proposals, to
Denning, etc. "GAKscape"?)
