Is it really important to distinguish the two sides ?  The additional threat
is that an attacker could spoof my correspondent to me, once she's grabbed my
secret key. But a) I thought we were assuming that other people being spoofed
is _their_ problem, not ours, and b) if she's nabbed my key, odds are she's
hacked my account anyway, leaving me with much larger problems.

Hmm, `closely-held' suggests that the `public' key is being passed around
as a secret over some channels, in which case it might as well be
a secret key being passed around over those channels to the 10 people.

Wouldn't there only be 45 ?  I agree that this is quite a few, but it's a
reasonable tradeoff between disk space and processing speed unless you're
communicating with a large number of people.
