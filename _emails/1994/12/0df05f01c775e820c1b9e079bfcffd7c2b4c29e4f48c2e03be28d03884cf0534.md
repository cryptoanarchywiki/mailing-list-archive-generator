It's a bit slow because it has all the traffic since June.  I'll implement
"expire and archive" soon so it'll be faster.  But its usable (I'm using
it over a 19.2 SLIP connection to our local network). 

I understand that pine can do something much tidier, pulling newsgroups from
multiple news servers.  Read yer docs fer details.
