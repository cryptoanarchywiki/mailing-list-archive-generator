I'm still very curious as to how the applied-for patent on RC5
protects the algorithm.  Perhaps it just protects the RC5 algorithm
family specifically, the idea being that if it becomes very popular
then anyone implementing it for compatibility reasons will be forced
to purchase a license to do so.
