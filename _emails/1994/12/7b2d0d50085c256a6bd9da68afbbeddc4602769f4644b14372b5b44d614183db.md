Hmmhh. I was _there_ in the 1950s, I _knew_ the 1950s. And let me tell
you, this is *not* the 1950s. (Apologies to Lloyd Bentsen.)

It may be backward, but it is how a huge fraction of the list accesses
the Net. Am I wrong on this? Dial-up access to local POPs is a fact of
life for many, many people. Do a "who cypherpunks" on the list and
look at the sites. Many will be dial-ups, others will be access to
university machines, via dial-ups, etc. Others will be a mix of
corporate machines, some with better connectivity than others, and
many with proprietary e-mail systems, such as VAXMail and the like. My
guess is that fewer than 20% of the list are directly SLIP- or
PPP-connected, with good access to the tools praised here by Amanda,
Perry, you, and others.

It might be a good idea to get some real statistics on this. We did
this a couple of years ago, and there was talk about doing it again.

For reasons I just addressed in another post, I foresee being on a
dial-up (not a SLIP or PPP, that is) for a while. And I have relatively
few complaints about it. My service provider keeps the 9446 current
newsgroups, provides ftp and suchlike tools, and I don't have to be a
sysadmin. Frankly, if I have to choose between not being able to see
someone's MIMEd GIF and becoming a Unix sysadmin for my own site, I'll
skip the GIFs.

Even Perry admits to using emacs, and Unix mailers like elm are not
exactly oxen. (I have a choice of several mailers, the usual ones. Big
deal.) I also have commercial Eudora, the PowerMac version no less, so
my offline mailer is adequate. This still doesn't mean non-ASCII
(graphics, fancy fonts, equations) can be plausible placed in
messages--and communicated to the list for reading/viewing.

I'd like to see some evidence that I am one of the last of my tribe.

Call me Ishi.
