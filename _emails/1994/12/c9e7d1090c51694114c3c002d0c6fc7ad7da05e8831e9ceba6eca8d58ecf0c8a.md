I had a very telling conversation with my wife today. I was working on some
procmail stuff while she thought I should be doing something else. After
about a ten minute diatribe, she said "I don't know why you spend all that
time messing around with that crypto stuff. What point does it have?" I
responded, "Do you remember when you were a little girl, and you told your
best friend a secret?" She replied with a testy "YES." "All I'm trying to
do is make sure our children will be able to do the same, because with all
the developments lately this may not be possible." After about ten minutes
of silence, I got a very soft "I understand."

The reason I have brought this conversation up is to make a point. You can
have the best technology around, but if people can't relate to the general
concepts involved as it relates to them, the war is lost.
