Very much agreed.  This is why, in my description of the rough criteria I sent 
out, I included mention of self-signed certificates (which only show that you 
do in fact have the private key corresponding to a given public key), bare 
keys, and so on.

There clearly needs to be facilities for encrypted anonymous use.  To expand 
on my example of wanting sales literature to be signed so I know it's genuine, 
I correspondingly *don't* want to include a certificate with identifying 
information in my own query--I get enough junk mail already, and I don't want 
vendors to be able to capture market research at the browsing level (I haven't 
looked at WIRED's server for precisely this reason).
