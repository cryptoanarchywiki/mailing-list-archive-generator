Vladimir Z Nuri says he's having trouble posting to the list, so here's the
note on phase three of the beta-test for his experimental reputation/mail
filtering software. Some people believe vznuri (the visionary) is Larry 
Detweiler; I don't really care - he's too coherent, and his software looks 
interesting. Non netcom-ers will have trouble ftp'ing to netcom, though.

Hello. At one time I posted a message asking for volunteers to help me debug 
some reputation/mail filtering software. My "phase two" tests are progressing
and the software is serving multiple subscribers with a degree of
reliability. 

I would now like to open up my tests to the wider cypherpunk
audience for "phase three".  I would be delighted if anyone would be 
interested in participating.

At this point I particularly need people who want to play with the 
command features and are not just subscribing to what they see as a free 
and no-involvement-required mail filtering service. In preparation
for any new users I have just html'd the complete documentation
for easy reference on my web site.

The software is still in a prototype stage and the redistribution of
messages is not at the utmost reliable level. In particular at this
stage I may still have to periodically put the list on "hold" periodically to 
debug the software. However at this point I believe the reliability
is rapidly nearing a high level.

For more information use Mosaic or Lynx to the URL

ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/vznuri/home.html

(I have relaxed earlier more formal nondisclosure terms but I do ask 
that you submit to an informal "nonpublicity" agreement.)

This will serve as the master bulletin board for future developments
in the software. pay special attention to the "status" item which
I will update very regularly (and in most cases use in lieu of
a mailing list)

Thanks--

p.s. this was posted through a remailer due to mailing problems at my end.
