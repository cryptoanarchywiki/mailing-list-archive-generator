Why do all this?  There already exists a Generic Security System API,
GSSAPI, which is an Internet standard (or there is at least an Internet
Draft -- I'm not sure what the current status is right now, and given
that the IETF is going on this week, it's status may change).

Currently, the only GSSAPI bindings I know of are for Kerberos V5 and
Kerberos V4, although there could easily be bindings for RSA, PGP, or
whatever you want.

I suggest you read up on GSSAPI, which provides much of the
functionality that you want, plus a lot more.  You would just have to
write a PGP binding to get it to work, but that shouldn't be too
difficult (I haven't looked at this).  It'll be even easier when there
is a PGP API.
