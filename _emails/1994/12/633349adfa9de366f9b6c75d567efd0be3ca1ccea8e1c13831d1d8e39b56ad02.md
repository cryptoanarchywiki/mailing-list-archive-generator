Such is certainly not the case for everyone.  I don't see that I
lose any anonymity by signing MY messages.  I regard it for the
most part as a necessary evil inherent in maintaining a stable,
reputable pseudonymous persona.  I sign everything I mail or post
so that eventually individuals who've become familiar with this
identity will suspect a spoof if they see something to which my
nym is attached but not my digital signature.

To be frank, it's something of a chore for me to sign everything.
I do it because there's a good reason for me to do so.
