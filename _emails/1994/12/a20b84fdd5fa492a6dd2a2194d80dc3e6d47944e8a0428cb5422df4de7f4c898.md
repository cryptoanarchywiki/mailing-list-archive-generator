-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Disclaimer: This document assumes that MIME is an OK thing and a possible 
tool for bringing crypto to the masses.  It does not assume anything 
about the current state of affairs concerning MIME mailers; rather, it 
serves as a possible impetus for code.  Critical posts of a non-technical 
nature ("MIME sucks, you moron!") will be ignored.

Watching the MIME flame wars, I was intrigued by the references quoted 
concerning PEM-MIME and so on, leading me to a great deal of research 
with an eye to writing some PGP-MIME kinds of tools.  In doing this, I 
happened upon a post by Mr. Borenstein in comp.mail.mime stating, in 
effect, that the previous draft standard of application/pgp was a dead 
end.  I also noticed that Mr. Borenstein called for volunteers to write a 
draft standard to integrate PGP into the PEM-MIME scheme developed at the 
last IETF meeting.  This seems like a golden opportunity to give mail 
vendors a "push" to integrate PGP with their mailers, so I thought I'd 
mention it here in case someone was interested who might have missed the 
comp.mail.mime post.

I've noticed Mr. Borenstein's presence here in cypherpunks; I invite him 
to clarify or update as needed.

I'd also volunteer to work on the draft, except that my qualifications to 
do so are about as low as you get on a list like this one, and I'm sure 
that just about anyone else would probably be more qualified.  However, 
if no one else is interested, I'll do what I can!
