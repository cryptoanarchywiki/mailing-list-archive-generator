So, I'm running a Mac //cx with a shell account at the moment.  I have a 
lowly 14.4k connection.

What solution do you have for the user who has no direct connection to 
the net, has merely a modem speed bandwidth, and is in a non-isdn area?

I often need to pull large files over 3 megs into my shell account at 
high speeds.  (60-100 kb/sec)  Impossible with SLIP.

Are you telling me that I can do this and still have the advantage of SLIP?

Forgive my ignorance, but you'll have to enlighten me.

Same balance for me when it comes to the transfer rate.

So how much am I expected to "shell out" ?

Sorry Tim, I'm with you.  You're not alone yet.

I'll come around when I'm sure I'm not losing anything.

Convince me.
