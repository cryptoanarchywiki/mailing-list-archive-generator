I have never posted to this list before because I am rather new to it.
What bothers me is that as a Hardware Technician it is the Cypherpunks
that inspired me to flagellate myself at my keyboard while invoking
the deity of Borland in ANSI 'C' to compile my source code. Ok, so it
never works but the idea of the Cypherpunks has made me a (limited)
programmer none the less.
*Not* signing messages because you are asked to flies in the face of
the purpose it serves. To spread the word about PGP and, as it has done,
uncover any difficulties that may still exist in the propagation and
utilitization of PGP. 
In actuality the amount of mail that suggests the difficulty in performing
PGP signing should be a call to all Cypherpunks to start coding. Instead,
like a child that has been asked to play with a favorite toy, there is 
refusal based soley on....I won't do it because you asked me to do it.
Forging signatures is a waste of resources that could be better spent
finding ways to smooth the path for PGP and similar encrypting/signing
implementations.
If I want to be anonymous  I will use CHAIN and go thru a remailer. 
My .sig and PGP sig say the rest.
