Subject: List of reliable remailers

   I operate a remailer pinging service which collects detailed
information about remailer features and reliability.

   To use it, just finger remailer-list@kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu

   There is also a Web version of the same information, at:
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html

   This information is used by premail, a remailer chaining and PGP
encrypting client for outgoing mail, which is available at:
ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/premail/premail-0.30.tar.gz

   For the PGP public keys of the remailers, as well as some help on
how to use them, finger remailer.help.all@chaos.bsu.edu

This is the current info:

                                 REMAILER LIST

   This is an automatically generated listing of remailers. The first
   part of the listing shows the remailers along with configuration
   options and special features for each of the remailers. The second
   part shows the 12-day history, and average latency and uptime for each
   remailer. You can also get this list by fingering
   remailer-list@kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu.

   Options and features

   cpunk
          A major class of remailers. Supports Request-Remailing-To:
          field.

   eric
          A variant of the cpunk style. Uses Anon-Send-To: instead.

   penet
          The third class of remailers (at least for right now). Uses
          X-Anon-To: in the header.

   pgp
          Remailer supports encryption with PGP. A period after the
          keyword means that the short name, rather than the full email
          address, should be used as the encryption key ID.

   oldpgp
          Remailer does not like messages encoded with MIT PGP 2.6. Other
          versions of PGP, including 2.3a and 2.6ui, work fine.

   hash
          Supports ## pasting, so anything can be put into the headers of
          outgoing messages.

   ksub
          Remailer always kills subject header, even in non-pgp mode.

   nsub
          Remailer always preserves subject header, even in pgp mode.

   latent
          Supports Matt Ghio's Latent-Time: option.

   cut
          Supports Matt Ghio's Cutmarks: option.

   post
          Post to Usenet using Post-To: or Anon-Post-To: header.
          
   special
          Accepts only pgp encrypted messages.

   ek
          Encrypt responses in relpy blocks using Encrypt-Key:
          header.


   Comments and suggestions welcome!
