Ben Smith writes supportively in the January 1995 issue on 
Netscape's products -- freebie and commerical.  See pp.197-200.

Two excerpts:

"Netsite Commerce Server is Netscape Communications' most 
important product because it offers the basic requirements for 
secure transactions over the otherwise 
open-for-snooping-and-spoofing Internet."  [Brief discussion of 
crypto system -- RSA, PGP similarity and difference.]

"Netscape Communications may not be able to clean out the loose 
threads and cobwebs of the Internet, but its client and servers 
are the kinds of products the Internet needs to make the 
transition from being a cobweb of experimental projects to a 
serious commercial marketplace."
