	With all due respect, I disagree with your assessment.
Anonymity is a job, and we should build small tools to do jobs.  It is
my feeling that building anonymity into the web will make the
protocols more complex than they need to be.

	There is no anonymity in mail, but we have anonymous mail of
varying privacy.  I suspect mixmaster will greatly enhance that.  To
get privacy in the web, build a web remailer on top of the CERN or TIS
HHTPd proxies.  Encrypt between you & the proxy, let the proxy go out.

| and control as possible to the individual end-users of the web.
| Otherwise privacy is going to be very difficult to maintain in this
| world of electronic commerce.
