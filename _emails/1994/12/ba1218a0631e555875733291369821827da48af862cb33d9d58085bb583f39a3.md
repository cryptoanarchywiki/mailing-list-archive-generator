True.  But I think the "balance of power" (actually, balance of
numbers) will shift in the future.

I make an analogy with manual transmission.  

For years, if you wanted to drive, manual transmission was the only
choice.  When automatic transmissions appeared, people scoffed.  Now,
automatic transmission dominate, and 20% of the driving population
prefers manual transmission.

For years, if you wanted internet connectivity, Unix was the only
choice.  When Warp, Windows NT, and Windows 95 (to be released ;)
appeared, people scoffed.  In the future, 20% of the internet
connected will still prefer Unix for some reason.
