It's worse than that!  They will allow customers to use their service
in NYC, I'm told by a customer of their's visiting this weekend, if
they pay for the call with a credit card (IE, VISA, MC, etc) that they
must *give* *an* *operator* *over* *the* *cellphone*.

So to avoid their own exposure to fraud, they're requiring their
customers to give credit card info over the cellphone.  Thanks, guys.

No pro-34s 'round here, nope.
