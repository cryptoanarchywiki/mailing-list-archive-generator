I have been a beta tester since the days of the very first Ecash clients
which would freeze my computer when run ;-)

I am very impressed with the latest clients. They work flawlessly. The only
thing missing is off-line transfer capability. Since the current beta has a
(dimmed) button for this, I don't think we will have to wait much longer.
