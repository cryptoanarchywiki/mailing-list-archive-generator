The MS-DOS ANSI bomb relies on the capability of redefining keystrokes
through the ANSI screen driver.  Most all the DOS boxen I lay hands on
lose this capability quickly, when I install more capable ANSI drivers
that have this misfeature disabled.  Fortunately, few people rely on
ANSI-based text viewers, so I'd hope that even the otherwise unprotected
machines have some immunity.  (how many people use 'type filename'
anymore?)

I first learned of ANSI bombs back in the Cretacious period (1989), when
it briefly became popular to slip them into PKZIP 0.92 comment fields.
I even saw a couple in files I downloaded, because even then I had
removed the function from my screen driver.  The attempted redefs would
show up as plain text.

[0;5;30;47mI wonder if anyone's mail readers are even succeptible?  (he
said, grinning)
