Arguably discussions about police abuses are red herrings used to avoid
addressing the real issue of workplace monitoring. :-)

I really don't want to know how many sips it takes an officer to finish a cup of
coffee, or if the officer has a genital itch problem while sitting in a speed
trap.  I think this crosses the line.

And where do we stop?  Do we wire other federal employees?  Does the secretary
for a research group in the FDA need to be wired?  It would be a short jump from
this to private sector use, which I do oppose.  Not everyone has the ability to
pick and choose employment.

This has wandered a bit off of Cryptological relevence.  I don't plan to reply
publically to this thread anymore, although I may do so privately.
