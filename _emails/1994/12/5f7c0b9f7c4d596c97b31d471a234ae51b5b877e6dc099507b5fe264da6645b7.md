I am about to release Mixmaster as a beta test. Before I do, I would like some
input on what size message packet to standardize on.

Each message includes twenty 1k headers, and a block with the message text.
Right now I have the text block size set to 4k. That seems small, but I am
worried about mail systems choking on big messages. Messages over the minimum
size are sent separately (through the same chain), and only recombined by the
last remailer in the chain. Previous remailers do not know that the message
parts are associated. This is quite secure, but not as good as a single packet,
so the fewer messages that get split up, the better. Mixmaster compresses the
contents of the text block.

So, any thoughts on what size the text block should be?

BTW Mixmaster still only runs on Sun. Several people are working on porting it
to linux. Help with porting to PC and Mac would be appreciated.
