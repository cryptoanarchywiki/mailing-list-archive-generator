This brings up a question:  I've been thinking about offering to give
talks to some of the local groups about computer security, privacy,
and encryption, with emphasis on PGP.

Myself not being the most knowlegable on this list and never wanting
to re-invent a working wheel, Has anyone developed a 60 to 90 minute
presentation outline they'd like to share with the list?

Thanks!
