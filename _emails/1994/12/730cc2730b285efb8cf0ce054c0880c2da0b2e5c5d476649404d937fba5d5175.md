A person buys a building and places a nightclub within. By your logic,
he does not own the nightclub, because another person could open a
nightclub.

Were Eric to trademark "Cypherpunks" and use it in trade as the name
of a mailing list, you could NOT create another one for the same
reason you couldn't sell "Coke". The fact that Eric has no interest in
doing this and doesn't claim to own the name does not change the
situation.
