No, I didn't propose such a correlation. Just a reminder that _many_
active posters are not routinely, or ever, signing. This is probably
not due to a minor (few second) delay but, rather, to much large
hassles (discussed here often, but having to do with editors on remote
machines not having access to PGP tools and keys on local
machines--this can be solved by moving the PGP onto the remote machine
or by sending the file to local machines with sz, etc.).

Like I said, "more power to them." I haven't gone this route, and
face, under the proposed system(s), delays and perhaps bounces. For
many reasons I think this is an unwise proposal.

You've just answered your earlier points.

Let me recount something that hasn't been mentioned on the list. At
the last Cypherpunks meeting, well-known Unix gearhead Raph Levien
demonstated his premail work: nearly transparent encryption,
decryption, remailing integrated into "pine," a mailer. Something
this "simple" (no insult to the work meant...I mean simple in the
sense that it is conceptually obvious and expected) drew oohs and aahs
from the generally savvy attendees. It tells us something.

(Yes, I may consider switching from my favored mail reader, elm, to
pine. But not soon, and maybe not ever.)

Others have touched on this. MIME stuff, mail wrappers, etc.

There are three main worlds to consider:

1. Users on their own secure machines, composing, signing, and
encrypting with tools on their own machine. Completed messages are
either mailed (e.g., Eudora, dial-up) or are otherwise send directly
(boxes sitting on the Net via SLIP, PPP, TIA, etc.)

2. Users who do some of their work on secure machines (perhaps at
home) but log in to remote machines that are not secure against packet
sniffers, snooping sysadmins, subpoenas (which may not even be
disclosed to the target, as in cases involving money transfers, drug
cases, etc.).

3. Users who do most of their work on unsecure machines outside their
control. Most corporate users who use corporate machines. Most
university students with campus accounts. 

PGP can and is used in all of these worlds.

#1 is taken care of by lots of tools. (And if I limited my mail to
Eudora, I could cope moderately well. But I don't even have Eudora
running on my new Mac configuration yet, and I favor reading mail
while logged-on to Netcom. Also, signing Netnews articles--not the
topic of current debate--is not addressed.

#2 is where additional tools are needed. A useful tool: agent-like
technology that could "reach back" with a zmodem-like squirting of
text to the local/home machine, do the sigs and encryption, and then
squirt back the processed text. 

(Ironically, short messages are moderately easy for me to verify, as I
can select the displayed text and use cut-and-paste. So long as all
the text is visible. Longer text messages require that I somehow get
the text--often by using sz to send it to my local machine--and this
typically takes more steps and requires more choices than I want to
deal with.).

#3 users are probably happy in their ignorance and have others to help
them with setups and configs. That so many students are diligent about
signing their messages--on "foobar.edu"--says a lot about the spread
of tools, helps, and common set of tools (e.g., everybody may be using
4.3 BSD and the same core set of editors and mailers).

I am dismissive of #3 because it's toy security. Not a foundation to
build on. But OK for students. Or employees. Or casual use.

Enough for now.
