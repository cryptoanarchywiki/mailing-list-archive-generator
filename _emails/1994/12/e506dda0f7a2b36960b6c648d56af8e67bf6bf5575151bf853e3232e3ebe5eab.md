As one of the few people who verify all PGP signatures for which I have 
keys, I have to say that encouraging people to put garbage in PGP 
signature blocks would be extremely annoying. Either I'll have to go back 
to using a non-PGP-aware mail reader, or fix it to do something sensible 
with such messages. While I'm going to have to do the latter at some point
anyway, there are much more useful things that I could be doing...
