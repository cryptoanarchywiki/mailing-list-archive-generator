Responding to msg by Black Unicorn, who is having a bad hair 
day (and so close to Christmas!):

"Had I encrypted with Norton encrypt?  I would have been 
deserving of whatever attack ensued."

Are the cypherpunks all of one mind regarding ideals and 
morality?   Had I inquired of the list how I could break into 
my dearest one's privacy, I would have been deserving of 
whatever commentary ensued regarding the disgusting 
implications of that act.

"Disgusting.  Get off this list, you belong on 
alt.codependency.recovery, or alt.bleeding.liberal."

(Say - isn't this why Tim left for a bit?   Oh, well.)  

"I may disagree with you, but I will defend to the death your 
right to express your [sanctimonious] opinion." (or something 
like that).
