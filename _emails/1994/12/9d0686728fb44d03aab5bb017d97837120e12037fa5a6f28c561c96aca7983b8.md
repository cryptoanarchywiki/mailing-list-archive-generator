Well it certainly is not essential for todays messages.

Drop into alt.binaries.pictures.*

When the news people wish to transmit pictures of naked girls, etc,
they do not use MIME

Now maybe they should use MIME, and maybe they will use MIME in

If you want to fix that, start programming instead of shooting
the messenger.
