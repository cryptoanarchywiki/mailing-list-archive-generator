If they are using terminal emulation they have only themselves to blame.

I can't help but wondering how big of a part you play in this.

Not to the list, but to others -- over email.

DUO 230. Can't go to 14.4, because I am "too far from the switch." PacBell

ObPlug:
Today we received the first two engineering samples of our new
lan/phone/video devices that give you 16Mbps using the very same 4 phone
wires that are already in your wall. At less than $100 per node. Call your
congressman today and demand local telco deregulation :-)

I volunteer.

Agreed.

Uhm, most people?
