lcottrell@popmail.ucsd.edu (Lance Cottrell) is known to have said:

Does anyone have the help-file for the anonymous pool of the extropia-
remailer, the one of <pool0-request>?
In the interest of widespread usage, please post it to the entire list.

If you can, please also let us know if there is a way for us to subscribe
via an anonymous remailer to an address we designate, like for instance
with the command

      subscribe special@address.here

where the special address given is obviously different from the one in the
header of the subscription message (which would merely be a remailer).

- -----------------------------------

Does anyone know more about Sameer's C2-services?
In the interest of widespread usage, please post a summary to the entire
cypherpunks-list.   Also urge others to copy, forward and post elsewhere.

- -----------------------------------

Last, I support the idea of a while ago that the remailer-operators mailing
list should be open for public subscription so all those interested can get
on and follow what is happened there.  But how do we subscribe?
Let us know, Sameer!
