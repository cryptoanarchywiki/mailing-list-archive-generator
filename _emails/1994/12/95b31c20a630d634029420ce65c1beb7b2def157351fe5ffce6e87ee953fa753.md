   We feel somewhat troubled by these comments.  

As well you should.

The facts of the matter is that First Virtual currently provides a net
benefit by moving real value (e.g. dollars) around, and Digicash does
not.  Until the Digicash system can move real value, there is no
reason to use it.

The technology is irrelevant.  _If_ you can move real value, you can
provide a benefit.  _Only if_ you can move real value can you provide
a benefit.
