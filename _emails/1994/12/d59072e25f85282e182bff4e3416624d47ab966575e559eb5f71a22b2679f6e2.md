I just got a second phone line, and decided that if I was going to get a 2-line
phone it might as well be a good one, so I am considering a Motorola Secure 
Clear cordless 2-line phone with speakerphone. This will be quite an investment,so I was wondering whether the Secure Clear phones are digitally encrypted or
merely scrambled using some analog method. Anybody know about this? How secure
are these phones really? --Wes

I speak for no one.
Trust no one. 
Cryptography is outlawed and only the outlaws care.
When thinking is outlawed, maybe then somebody will care.
When thinking is outlawed, only outlaws will be able to care.
<sigh, depressing .sig>
