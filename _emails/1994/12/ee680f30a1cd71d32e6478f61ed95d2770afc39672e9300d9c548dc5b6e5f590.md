From the spec, the appendix on certificates:

   Certificates are validated using a few straightforward steps. First,
   the signature on the certificate is checked and if invalid, the
   certificate is invalid (either a transmission error or an attempted
   forgery occurred). Next, the CertificateInfo::issuer field is verified
   to be an issuer that the application trusts (using an unspecified
   mechanism). The CertificateInfo::validity field is checked against the
   current date and verified.

Here is what we do in Netscape (for now). We have imbedded a set of
certificates in the client. The certificates are for issuers of
certificates that "we" trust. Any server which is certified by one of
these issuers will be automatically trusted by the Netscape
Navigator...

Admittedly this is primitive, but it's a start.
