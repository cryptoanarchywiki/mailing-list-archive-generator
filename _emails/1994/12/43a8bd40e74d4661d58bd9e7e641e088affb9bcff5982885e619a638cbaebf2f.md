From the messages appearing on the list it would seem that 
responding to messages sent via Masco's auto-signer needs to be done 
carefully, apparently the less-than-less diligent will just respond to the 
From: address instead of to the automagical response demon at 
jya@pipeline.com

I would hate to see the valuable service provided by jya become a source
