Exponentiation-based ciphers such as Diffie-Hellman
use the fact that discrete logarithms are hard, but
modular exponentiation is easy. So we quickly 
compute:

x^y mod n (where n is prime)

But not:

log_x(x^y mod n) mod n

Think of the numbers between 0 and n-1 as a group that
work sort of like all Integers taken as a whole. Because
they do have many of these properties, this makes these
numbers an "abelian" group. So we can use some old properties
from arithmatic such as:

   (a * b * c) mod n  == (((a * b) mod n) * c) mod n

With an elliptic curve, such as y^2 = x^3 - x, you can define
a set of coordinates {<x0, y0>, <x1, y1> ... <xt, yt>} that are on
the curve, where all x and all y are in a group like we use
for Diffie-Hellman.

For the different isomorphisms of the curves, you can then
construct addition of coordinates, subtraction, multiplication
and division, such that the results are also points on the
curve. This makes this set of points an abelian group too. 

You can then do a Diffie Hellman analogue substituting
multiplication for exponentiation, and a El Gamal analogue
substituting multiplication for exponentiation and addition
for multiplication. 

I have just recently been researching this subject, but I can
provide some references tomorrow, if people are interested. I 
have found what appears to be an implementation of some of the 
artithmatic in a package called "pari", but  I haven't had a 
chance to look at it closely. There are no p.d. elliptic curve
_cryptography_ implementations that I'm aware of, which is 
something I'd like to see change... :-) There is an IEEE group 
working on a proposed standard at the moment; I need to get back 
to my contact with them to find out where they are at now.

Most of the work in this area is being done by smart card 
people, because ec's seem to give you more bang for your buck 
in terms of modulus size, etc.

Hope this helps. 

Doug
