I have dropped into alt.binaries.*. Thanks to my newsreader (freeware), the
pictures there are a _mouseclick_ away from my harddrive. Even multi-part
posts take ONE mouseclick. MIME isn't even needed here. Capable clients
are. And they are avaialable today. All I am asking is that people start
using them instead of complaining how difficult it is to do things on the
net.
