Hello,

On his weekly call-in TV show on National Empowerment Television tonight, 
Newt received a call asking about his opinion on the Clipper Chip, and he 
replied that it was a moot point, in that the Clipper chip concept was 
designed for a condition that no longer exists.

So, paranoiacs, lighten up! :-)

-


respect to all,

Ken            ken@snowcrest.net   (primary address)
               (if no answer, try ken.stuart@tigerteam.org )
