I am sorry if I seemed to be saying that:  I well know that that is
not true.

But right now today everyone one the net who sends out a form
through netscapes 0.96 web browser gets a warning that his form
is not encrypted, with the implication that it should be.

(Unless he turns off the warning.)

Thus millions of people are being exposed to cryptography.

What I meant to say is that Netscape is bringing Crypto to
the *masses* and you are not.

I did not intend to say that Netscape is bringing Crypto and
you are not.
