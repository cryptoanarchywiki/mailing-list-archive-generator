... when they're at their desk.  There has been an explosion, however, of
non-80-column-capable devices on which people want to read their email.
Alphanumeric pagers, Handheld PDAs, palmtop computers, etc.  Give me a radio
modem with reasonable service coverage, and I'd want to read at least some
kinds of mail on my Newton (about 32-48 characters across the display).
In fact, the ability to display graphics is becoming universal in areas
where 80 columns have been tossed aside.

Very few people use actual terminals any more.  I'd be amazed if any more
than 5-10% of the readership of this group (and the Internet at large)
were using anything but a graphics display, even if it's emulating a VT100.

I should stop now, though.  I feel the urge to bring up Hollerith cards
and keypunches again :).
