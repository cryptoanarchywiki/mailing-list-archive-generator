Exactly my point Jeff.  Thank you for justifying what I said....**WINK**, 
**GRIN**.
In order to even use PGPClip, it involves something OUTSIDE the mail 
application.  (Although, it does sound intriguing to me.)  Anyway, this is yet 
another example of the user needing to be fully conscious that they are 
signing or encrypting.  It should be second nature.  In order for it to become 
second nature, it MUST be included in the design of the mail package. (Or News 
reader, or FTP software, whatever.)

Third party utilities make a piece of software harder to use.  That's a given.  
Now, don't get me wrong, there are some nice thrid party vendor products out 
there.  But, I have yet to see a crypto product that merges (cross platform) 
into a mail package smoothly.

Didn't see any sparks at all, Jeff.  I am interested in PGPClip (at least to 
look at) does anyone have an FTP site pointer where I could find it?
