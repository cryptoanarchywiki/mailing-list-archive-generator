DD+I have a flawless philosophic/scientific model of reality.

So far you're doin' fine.

Actually real punks hack whole systems, so we go out and run Congress, 
(me) or Japanese science (my ex-wife) or the CIA and State Department 
in Africa (the woman I am about to marry). 
 
Everything you say about writing code, designing protocols, analysing 
ciphers and assessing risks (also writing articles and attending 
conferences) is pretty much correct.  It also helps to sleep with the 
right women at times, a point which seems to escape the essentially 
male computer-freek culture.  Good table manners and a certain amount 
of familiarity with other languages help; my next wife, for instance, 
is only mine because I can say "ayin l'gazal", eyes like a gazelle's, 
something I must have picked up while sussing out your local bunch of 
AK-47 carrying terorists -- or half-starved recent Canadian immigrants, 
whichever story you care to believe.
 
I have to leave now: I am about to be visited by my neighborhood 
sociopath, a guy who works for Steve Wynn and all those folksin Las 
Vegas.  He has a new and interesting story to tell me.  I've heard it 
all before.
  
But it's going to be interesting to hear the latest version.
