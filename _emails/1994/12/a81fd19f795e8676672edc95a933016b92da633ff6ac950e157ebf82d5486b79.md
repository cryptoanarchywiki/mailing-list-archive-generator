Sure.  Netscape has managed to alienate many IETF working groups, including
HTML, HTTP Security, IP security, and so on by implementing and distributing
half-cooked "extensions" to HTML & HTTP without a lot of forethought.  As a
result, they've greatly multiplied existing interoperability problems, and
created a very confused environment in precisely those areas that most need
standardization and consensus (security and HTML itself).

That help?
