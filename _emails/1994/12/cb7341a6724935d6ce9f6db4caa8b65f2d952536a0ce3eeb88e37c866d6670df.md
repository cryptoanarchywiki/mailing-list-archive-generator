GATT doesn't say that the world has to adopt US patent laws. It insists on
the acceptance of certain categories of biotech and pharmaceutical patents,
but not algorithms or software. Nor does registering a global patent become
significantly easier - you still have to file (and pay for) patents in each
country you want to 'work' it. Filing first in PCT (Patent Coorporation
Treaty) signatories makes the process somewhat cheaper, that's all.

So GATT is unlikely to affect RSA.
