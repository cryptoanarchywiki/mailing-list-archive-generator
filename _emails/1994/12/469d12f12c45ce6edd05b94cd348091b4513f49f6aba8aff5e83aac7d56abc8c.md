The Train
Author Unknown

A few days after Christmas a mother was working in the kitchen, listening
to her son playing with his new electric train in the living room. She
heard the train stop and here son said, "All you sons of bitches who want
off, get the hell off now 'cause this is the last stop And all you sons of
bitches who are getting on, get your asses in the train 'cause we're 
leaving."

The mother went in and told her son, "We don't use that kind of language in
this house. Now, I want you to go to your room for two hours. When you come
out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language."

Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with
his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, "All
passengers who are disembarking the train, please remember to take all your
belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your
trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon."

"For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage
under the seat. Remember there is no smoking except in the club car. We hope
you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today."

"For those of you who are pissed off about the two hour delay, please see
the bitch in the kitchen."
