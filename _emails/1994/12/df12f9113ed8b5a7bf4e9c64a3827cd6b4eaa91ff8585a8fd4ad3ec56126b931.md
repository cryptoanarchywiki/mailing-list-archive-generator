Mike Ingle suggests adding a one-shot reply capability to the remailers,
to discourage hit-and-run abusers by allowing replies to them.
The reply token would become invalid after either one use or timeout.
One problem with this approach is that, if the sender is on the
mailing list / newsgroup that the message is sent to,
he can use up the one-shot reply himself if he's quick,
by being the first one to reply.  It's also somewhat difficult
to design a system where the one-shot replies would chain.

Non-automatic non-mandatory one-shot replies are more useful,
since there are times you may want to get replies.
