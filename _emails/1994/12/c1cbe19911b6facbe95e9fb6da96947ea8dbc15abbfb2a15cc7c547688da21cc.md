People who aren't yet able to securely use PGP to post to the cypherpunks
mailing list, take heart.  Eric has indicated that he doesn't care which
flavor of encryption software you use.

I have a user-friendly version of the encryption algorithm most widely
used on the Internet.  I haven't uploaded it to any FTP sites yet, but
if you email me, I can send you a copy of the source code.
