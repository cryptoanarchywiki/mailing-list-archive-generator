As most of you know, the SPA/NSA deal for auto-approved export
requires 512 bit RSA and 40 bit RC4.

Everyone knows that 40 bit RC4 is weak cryptographically, but no one
particularly thought that 512 bits RSA was -- weakening, maybe, but
not down in the real-time crack range.

I had an insight yesterday as to that particular requirement.
Consider the standard kind of way that one uses a hybrid crypto
system.  The secret session key is encrypted with the public key.
There are now two ciphers that can be broken.  And you only need to
break one of them.

So the NSA breaks 40-bit RC4 by brute force.  The keyspace is small.
What is left unsaid about the search is that candidate decryption keys
need to be selected.  You can't do a ciphertext only attack if the
plaintext is random bits.

The 512 bit RSA can be used to verify candidate keys.  Doing 2^40
modexp's is probably not how it's done (but it might be), but if you
can eliminate the bulk of candidate RC4 keys in some other way (by
looking at trial decryptions) then you've got a way of verifying the
rest of them.  If trial decryption can eliminate, say, one of every
hundred or thousand keys then the RSA verification could be done in
real time.

So it's possible the RSA requirement is in there to provide an
assurance that the right key was selected.
