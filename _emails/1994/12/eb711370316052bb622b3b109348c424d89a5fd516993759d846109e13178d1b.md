Some thoughts on this:

Will the people *believe* the electronic position data?   Nope.

When you are busted not only will you be frisked but you will also be
bulk erased :-)  (to get TC's DAT tape!)

The technology to fabricate video evidence is there is it not?

There was a relatively recent sad case of two officers that had a video
camera installed in their patrol car.  They had pulled over a speeding car.
While obtaining the license the occupants of the car murdered the policemen
and the *entire* scene was obtained on video tape.

When the tape was later reviewed, searching for a clue as to what happened,
the individual had to watch the officers slowly die - all captured on video.
It is possible that they might have been saved had this been real-time video
rather than taped.

Consider the next level here folks?  Will just having archived knowledge of
where certain people are be adequate?  Will there not ultimately be a call
for real time monitoring of these officers?  Will that be something that would
be cool with them?  

Another great idea would be anonymous real-time monitoring of vital signs
along with position data.  Auto-911 if you will.  We know somebody at this 
corner had a heart attack 5 minutes ago where is he?

Cheers
