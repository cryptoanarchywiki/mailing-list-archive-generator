This DDJ reference to export control laws is pretty typical:
 
AS+From: nobody@jpunix.com (Anonymous)
AS+ENCRYPTION software.  Is posting such software online worldwide the same as
  +exporting it?  If so, the State Department might have a thing or two to say.
 
The State Department may claim the right to have some say in things 
under the Commerce Clause, Article 1, Sec. 8 of the Constitution.  

Seems to me, however, that the Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments 
pretty clearly slap this claim down: the right to trade freely 
predates the United States, and is hence "reserved... to the people", 
in the language of the Tenth.
