I was told this morning that the ASIS post had been reposted
to several other lists, including several social ones.  Interesting...

Anyway, there was a followup to the incident on the radio this
morning (2BL, is anyone was listenning):

Gareth Evans (Minister for Foreign Affairs) has announced that no
documents were irretrievably lost in the fire, as everything which was
lost in the fire was also duplicated elsewhere.  In addition to this,
the fire is being referred to the ACT coroner's office, as despite
the original claim by the Federal Government that there were no suspicious
circumstances, the Australian Federal Police have decided to do pursue this
action.  It is not clear yet whether this is a matter of proceedure,
or whether suspicious circumstances are suspected.  The government's
original claim was produced with surprisingly little time for investigation,
it has been noted.

						Ian.
