I think I'm missing something here.  Isn't the Digicash system in a
beta-phase?  At this point, aren't they just trying to work out the kinks
and show people that it works? 

Obviously, a system that hasn't been deployed isn't as useful as one that
has.  The question is, once Digicash is released for real, how will it 
compare to FV?

I don't have any Digicash software yet, but I'm very interested in it, 
and I wonder if anyone else feels that a Digicash beta testers mail list 
would be a good thing.  I'd like to hear what you guys think of it.
