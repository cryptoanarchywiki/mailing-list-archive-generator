That's ok.  Without a government to wield, they would be ignorable.

Tax revolts do no good.  Taxes are the _result_, not the cause.

The cause of big government is popular gratuitous acceptance of
government favor.

If you want to shrink government, you've got to begin by changing the
minds of a hundred million of your neighbors who think it's civilized to
take a government job or contract, accept social security, apply for an
SBA loan or FEMA assistance, and on down the list.

I know a tax revolter who held an anti-tax rally on a tax-funded picnic
ground without even noticing or acknowledging the inconsistency.

This is why it's unshrinkable.  We have met the enemy, and he is us.
