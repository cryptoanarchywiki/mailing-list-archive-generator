Dear AOL Postmaster:
The message below has apparently been circulating quite widely. Personally I
doubt the authenticity of the claim, and strongly suspect that it's just an
annoying attempt to create a chain letter. In any event, it would be handy
to hear some sort of statement from AOL about this matter to stem the tide
of largely unproductive speculation on various mailing lists. I'm cc:ing this
to the cypherpunks list <cypherpunks@toad.com>, and encourage you to cc: your
reply to the list. I recommend posting some sort of announcement to the 
comp.virus newsgroup as well. Thanks very much for your time.

- -L. McCarthy <lmccarth@cs.umass.edu>
