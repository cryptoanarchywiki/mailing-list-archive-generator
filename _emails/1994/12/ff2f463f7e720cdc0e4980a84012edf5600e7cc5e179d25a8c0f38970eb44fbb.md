In case the bandwidth on {alt.anonymous, alt.anonymous.messages} started to
bother news admins, we could actively encourage them to put the groups on
very short expiration periods, i.e. articles might expire after only a day.
Assuming people are using automated sniffers to collect their anonymous mail,
this shouldn't present any obstacle to the use of the groups as message pools.
Keeping the ciphertext around in public for a shorter time sounds like a
Good Thing (tm), anyway. 
I agree that bandwidth seems essential to foiling traffic analysis.
