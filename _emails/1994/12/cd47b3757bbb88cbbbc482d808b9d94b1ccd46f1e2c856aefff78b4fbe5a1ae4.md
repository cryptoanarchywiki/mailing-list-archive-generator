Dear Cypherpunks,


1. I need a good DOS software random number generator for a crypto
project of mine. Can anyone give me the ftp site & other d/l info.
of something good?

2. Also needed, is some software documentation tools. - shareware or
free. Here's the problem: I program in PC Assembler & C & although
I program structured & use modules, I find that when I have a lot of
subs that if I pick out anyone of them, that I have a hard time relating
it to the rest of the code. That is to say: if I start out with say 3
major modules & have them call subs that call subs that call subs, then
when I examine anyone sub, it is hard to understand its relation to
the rest of the code. Anyone recommend a program with an ftp site or have
any helpful info on this?

                                              Yours Truly,
                                              Gary Jeffers
Following is my military grade public key armored.
