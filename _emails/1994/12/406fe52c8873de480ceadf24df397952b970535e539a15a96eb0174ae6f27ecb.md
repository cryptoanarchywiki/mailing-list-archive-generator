Related to our earlier discussions about expendable computer sites:

A quote from the article:
The Ghost Board, by Autolycus, in 2600, v10, n3, autumn 1994, p11

"For a short period of time in the early 90's, one Ghost Board pioneer
abandonned an AT (he'd purchased it for $40 at the Goodwill) on the roof
of a rural supermarket. The AT was water-protected and hardwired into the
store's power grid and the 2400 modem was spliced into the store's phone
lines. This system operated for almost five months before it was
(apparently) detected and shut down."

(The rest of the article is anecdotes about hiding BBS's inside
other BBS's.)
