Thank you, Pierre, and everyone else who has responded both privately
and through the cypherpunks mailing list.  I will post a summary of
the procedure and any other relevant information when I (finally!)
find out what that is.  

Thanks also for the translation of the french law you posted.  Someone from
France had sent me the original, and while I can read it, this will
save me some work writing up a translation for our lawyer.

Best wishes to all,
