Hi, punks,

Sony, our parent company, began to provide several info and
technical support for NEWS users on the WWW server.

# Note that 'NEWS' is Sony's UNIX workstation.
# Mainly, NEWS are used in Japan.
# So, you probably don't know it...

The Home Page is at URL:  http://www1.sony.co.jp/

CAUTION:
(1) The home page of it has large graphics data.
(2) Homepage has some Japanese characters.  So you can not
    read there probably.

If you have time, peek it please.

Thanks.

P.S.
This home page is NOT the (all of) Sony's home page.
This page is managed by a NEWS support group.
