Not just you; the opinion of some of the IBMers there was that they
didn't think it covered their proposal, either.

Just considering it. In my opinion, none of the existing key
management proposals is sufficient. They all have the feature that
very good cryptographers have sweated over the cryptography in them
but that the systems don't attach enough information to the resultant
security associations to permit you to actually write secure
applications, which in the end makes the excercise less than
completely successfull.
