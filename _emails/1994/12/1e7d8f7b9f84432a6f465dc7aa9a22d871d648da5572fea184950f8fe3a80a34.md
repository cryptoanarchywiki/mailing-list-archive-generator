It's at oak.oakland.edu (and, presumably, all mirror sites) as:

pub/msdos/offline/apgp212.zip

I use both Yarn and AutoPGP; each has different strengths.  I find that
for Internet use Yarn meets almost all my needs, but AutoPGP comes in
very handy for occasional use, mainly with QWK packets from bbs's.

BTW, signing and/or verifying email and Usenet posts is a snap for me,
so I'm pretty indifferent to the recent debates here.  But -- as usual with
public-key crypto -- key management is the rub:  I don't want to snarf
all ~6,000 keys from the servers, nor to grab keys piecemeal via email/
/finger/www every time I encounter a signed message from a cypherpunk
who's not currently in my key ring.  I could, of course, just continue to
ignore signatures, but Eric's proposal may turn into quite an interesting
experiment, judging from the responses thus far. :-)

Has anyone considered setting up a site where only folks on this list could
store and retrieve keys?  Perhaps a single file containing keys for the
hundred or so active posters that could be ftp'd and stored as a secondary
key ring...cpunkeys.pgp or whatever.  I'd really prefer to keep my main
key ring small so that access is quick (well...semi-quick).
