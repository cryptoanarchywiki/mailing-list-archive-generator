Nah, we'd be up anyway ;)  Seriously, I don't think there's a practical issue,
in light of the existence of Todd Masco's signing service. Perhaps at some
time far in the future Eric will raise the stakes, but we can cross that
bridge when we come to it. I simply changed my c'punks list alias to point to
the signing service instead of the list itself, and everything else continues
as before.

Regarding placing a direct SLIP connection between my machine and the nearest
workstation in the office, I will investigate the option. It may again be an
issue to get permission to start plugging extra cables into a machine owned
by the dept.
