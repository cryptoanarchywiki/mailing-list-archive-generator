The ftpd's that implement the directory-change messages is not a standard
one, and that functionality has been added to the servers which support it
(possibly Linux ships with wuftpd, but no commercial version of Unix I know
does.)  The extended servers are very widely available, and although they
do make ftp so much nicer to administer, they are not as widely deployed as I
would have expected by now.
