I am not completely clear on what sort of communication you are trying to
protect, and what your threat model is.

Are you worried about an attacker noticing that an anonymous ID is getting a lot
of messages? If you are using PGP and a message pool, any attacker can decrypt
all the messages, and see which correspond to which key, and therefor to which
anonymous ID. The only way around this is to use private key crypto. If you are
doing that, then you can also use a shared secret to generate a stream of one
use message IDs.
