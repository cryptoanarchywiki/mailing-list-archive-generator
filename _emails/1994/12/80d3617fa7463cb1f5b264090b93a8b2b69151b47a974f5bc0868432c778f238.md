  Pardon me if someone else mentioned this(I just re-subscribed to the 
list). If the person in question really wants to read his GF's private 
files his best be would be to guess passwords, toss her purse/diary for 
the password written down, and all the other basic physical attacks 
available to him.

  Moral note: If he feels that this is necessary then this is definatly a 
relationship that should not continue(for her sake).
