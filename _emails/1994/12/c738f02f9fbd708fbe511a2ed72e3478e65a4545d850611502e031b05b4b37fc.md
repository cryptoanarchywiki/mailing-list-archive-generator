I fear what you request would probably violate many laws.  Providing you 
with weaponry has little to do with providing you the information you 
might need to obtain and modify such weapons as you will need.

I will however be happy to direct you to several publications on the
manufacture and use of silencers, disposable and otherwise.  I will also, 
as an academic gesutre, be happy to provide you with likely sources or 
methods to obtain or otherwise control handguns and other such weaponry.

As for my addresses, I'm sure if you're serious about killing me and my 
family, you'll be able to obtain these.  Arguing that they are in the 
public domain, unless I have put them there, is just silly, off point and 
misunderstands the differences between the basic need of publication and 
distribution of potential weaknesses and attacks for the advancement of crypto
as a technology, and the privacy associated with the personal affairs of others.

I will advise you that I take significant personal security measures.  
Feel free to test these if you like.

As long as I don't have to listen to it on a crypto mailing list, fine.

As I have stated, I will never argue a duty to disclose, only that a 
moral argument cast as a cypherpunks position is outrageous.

Forgive me for not adding "Or say nothing at all" to the end of my 
comment, I thought the readership of the list astute enough to pick up on 
this themselves.  It seems I was mistaken.

I argued that morality should have never entered in to the conversation.
If you want to be meta-physical, I suppose this is a "moral" position.  
I'll discuss this in e-mail if you wish.

Person A requests information.
Person B says no, because the use of the information is unsound in person 
B's view.

Censorship?  You tell me.

It seems everyone is convinced that I was insisting on some sort of duty 
to disclose.  I was not, I will not.

What you do in your own home is fine.  When it comes to information about 
the strengths and weaknesses of crypto, a moral judgement is not required.

Personal opinion which you insisted I refrain from expressing.

I believe the word you used was "Typical"
