I was the one who asked Freeh the question, after he gave a talk at the 
conference on Global Cryptography.  I said that while the administration 
is 
currently saying that they are not interested in regulating cryptography 
domestically, what if in the future the wiretaps you get yield scrambled 
messages that you can't decipher.  (Meaning, do you regulate then?)  

Freeh asked, "In terms of encryption being a voluntary standard?"

"Yes," I said.

"Oh yeah, definitely," he said.  "If five years from now we solved the 
access 
problem, but what we're hearing is all encrypted, I'll probably, if I'm 
still 
here, be talking about that in a very different way; the objective is the 
same.
The objective is for us to get those conversations whether they're by an 
alligator clip or ones and zeros.  Wherever they are, whatever they are, 
I need
them."
