If you have access to a SLIP line, but frustrated with perhaps less of
a machine than you would like, give MINUET a try.

It is a DOS based tool designed for students with cheap/old computers
so they can access the Internet. It includes embedded POPmail,
news, ftp, telnet, ping etc.

It is available anonymous FTP from

boombox.micro.umn.edu

   /pub/pc/minuet/beta16/minuarc.exe

or /pub/pc/minuet/shaky/minuarc.exe  <--beta17

SLIP software that goes with it is at
/pub/pc/slip/latest/sliparc.exe

The beta17 has caused no problems for me yet. Beta17 has some
performance advantages. A 386 should be no problem at all.
