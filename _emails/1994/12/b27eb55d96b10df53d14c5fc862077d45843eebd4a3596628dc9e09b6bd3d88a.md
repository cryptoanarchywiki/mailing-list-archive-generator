The problem I had was the justification of refusal to disclose in some 
moral argument.  Even more annoying was the poster's attempt to cast that 
argument as a cypherpunk position (of which there are none).

Like I said, I will be the last to argue there is any sort of duty to 
disclose, and the first to flame if someone justifies their refusal to 
disclose on anything other than an individual decision not to.

A lecture on morality accompanying a refusal to disclose is just arrogant.
