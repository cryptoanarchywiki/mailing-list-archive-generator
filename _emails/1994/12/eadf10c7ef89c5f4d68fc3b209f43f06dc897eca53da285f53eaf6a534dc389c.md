Marc,
have you ever been in an empty lab with an htpd server - late at night? You
can HEAR it when Mozzilla hits the site. Two or three Mozzilla users at the
same time will kill your server. Unless, I understand, it uses your server
software for which you charge money.

Can you be surprised that there are a significant number of people out
there who are wondering if your "selfless" deed of giving away your client
software for free was really all that selfless?
