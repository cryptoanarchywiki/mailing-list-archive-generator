I happened to be talking to a friend who works for a Very Large 
International Corporation.  He has just been put in charge of 
managing their new products division.  First on the list is 
whether and how to become a value added reseller of digital 
telephones and/or digital telephone services in Europe and 
evetually worldwide.  They would probably include some 
financial/transactional services as part of the package.

He is pro-encryption, but not well informed.  What should he 
insist the telephones have in the way of features? What should 
he read?  He is not an engineer (he used to be a salesman...) 
but he's smart. 

I will summarize emailed replies to the list. Please note that
this ID expires on Dec. 27.
