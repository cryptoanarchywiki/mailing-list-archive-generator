   in all this discussion about how well it would work and ways around it,
   I think I've missed the problem that people are trying to solve.

I want more people to actually use cryptography.  I don't phrase it as
a problem, with it's implicit value judgement, but rather as what I want.

   isn't it ironic that privacy advocates are suggesting manditory
   loss of anonimity (which is what forced signing is).

The first appearance of a key is anonymous.  The second and later are
pseudonymous.  Even mandatory signing (which is not what is being
proposed) does not eliminate anonymity.

Eric
