You'll probably get multiple answers for this.  The code in PGP that 
allows you to enter 2048 bit keys isn't enabled until 12/25/94, so you
need to set your clock ahead to try this (and don't forget to set it
back--I spent three days sending people "Christmas" mail :)

Also, though I'm not sure why, it seems that the generated keys are only
2047 bits in length.  This was my experience, and has been reported in
alt.security.pgp by a number of others as well.  Expect about a 15-20
minute key generation time on a 486/66 PC.
