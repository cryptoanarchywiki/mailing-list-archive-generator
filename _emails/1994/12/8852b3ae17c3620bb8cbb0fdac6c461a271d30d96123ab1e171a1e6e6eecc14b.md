-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----


My most sincere apologies: due to a Truly Heinous filesystem lossage mode,
(thanks, DEC, for ultrix 4.2!) the sign/forward service cypherpunks@hks.net
has been broken since late Wednesday and everything through it has been lost.
I just got back from DC/MD/VA and corrected the problem.

I've modified things so that this will not happen again (at worst,
signing and forwarding will be delayed until the queue is manually
run).

Again, I very much apologize for this.
