When rtm used this technique in his worm I'm sure a lot of people,
such as myself, spent the five minutes necessary to hack up a program
that tries XORing the input with all 256 possible bytes.  I had the
program pipe the output of each try through strings and wc, to check
whether any significant text was uncovered.  Only 0x00 and the single
now-forgotten value he used got hits - no second XOR value.

Anyway the point is it's *really* by no means secure, and you can do
much better with a few minutes thought.  Set up a basic framework
using a Makefile that takes a file of
    MNEMONIC	"text string"
and runs it through an encoding program to produce a .h file of
    static char* text[] = {
	...
    #define MNEMONIC 17
	"vb4hv7789sd",
Then in your actual program you just call decode(text[MNEMONIC]);
Given that simple framework you can experiment with lots of different
encoding and decoding functions.
