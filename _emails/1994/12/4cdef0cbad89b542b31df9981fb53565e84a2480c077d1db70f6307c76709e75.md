This misses the point I was trying to make.  The first argument
in favor of wiring the cops, is that it is to their benefit.  It
helps backup officers or medical personnel to find them.  It
protects them from unfounded accusations of brutality or other
misconduct.  It makes a permanent visual and sound recording of
perps who get away.  This helps in later identification.

Even with all these arguments in favor of wiring, I have a
sneaking suspicion the cops will not want it.  Why?  Though few
police would admit it publicly, my conjecture is that they know
they are currently getting away with murder (sometimes literally)
and would feel being wired would force them to obey the law.  So
my "teensy-tiny-minority" argument was offered sarcastically.  In
addition, I think recording officers' shifts would show just how
little work cops actually do for their pay.  Wiring would really
throw a money wrench in the doughnut-boys cushy deal.

Cynical?  You betcha.
