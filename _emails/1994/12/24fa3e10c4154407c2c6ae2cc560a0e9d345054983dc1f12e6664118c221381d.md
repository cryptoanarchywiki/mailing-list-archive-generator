	I'm sorry, I didn't know that I wasn't allowed to have fun _and_ be on
this list. The MacGuru was picked up here on campus, and since I rarley send 
mail off campus, I usually forget to turn it off.

	As far as having the anon address in my sig, L. McCarthy
<lmccarth@ducie.cs.umass.edu> said:

	I did this for the exact same reason. If someone wants to mail me
anonymously, they have the option to just mail my anon account. What's so
wrong with that??

Someone (I'm not sure who) brought up the point that the file could actually
be an ANSI bomb. It seems to me that for the IBM and clone users on the 'net,
this could be something that they would want to watch out for. Now we all know
that it wasn't real (and many of you just "knew" it wasn't), it doesn't matter,
does it?
