I'm working on the lowest common denominator theory. Maybe they have PGP
set up...maybe they don't. If they do then they can verify the signature.
If they don't they still will have uudecode on their system and can access
the file. Nothing frustrates me more than trying to get a file only to find
out unexpectedly I need something else to access it.
