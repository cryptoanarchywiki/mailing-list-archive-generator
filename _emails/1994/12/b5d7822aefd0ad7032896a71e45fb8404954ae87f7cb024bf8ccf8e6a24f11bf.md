Uhh, this is not at all true.  When PGP verifies a message, it will
strip out the quoting dashes in the output.  This is documented in RFC
822 (I think) about quoting messages.

Just run the message through PGP and it will strip out the first level
of quoting in the output message, and you should be able to then run
PGP on the rest of the message as well.

This is not a bug, it is a feature to let PGP know *WHAT* was being
signed, so that nested PGP clearsigned-messages don't interfere with
each other.  If it didn't quote, then if I wanted to clearsign a PGP
message, the output would look something like:

- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

stuff here

- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

more stuff here

- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
inside signature
- -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
outside signature
- -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

If you have this, how do you deal with it?  This is the same as the
paranteses-matching-problem: If you are trying to match opens with
closes, you have the problem that you could always have so many opens
that you overrun your counter before you get to any closes!

So, PGP uses the RFC-822 quoting mechanism to quote internal messages.
This is perfectly legal.

As for MIME: If you are using PGP to secure MIME objects, you should
take the _OUTPUT_ from PGP and send that back into the MIME reader.
MIME should NOT be going inside the PGP block.  So, the behavior you
are seeing is perfectly reasonable for a broken mail-reader!  Fix your
mail reader to run the PGP-secured message through PGP, and then run
the output through MIME, and you will be fine!

Enjoy!
