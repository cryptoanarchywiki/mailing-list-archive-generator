Probably not. In my reply to a query about it, I recommended the
use of Viacrypt, mainly because of legal concerns, and partly because
of the prospects of printed documentation (I like manuals I can burn
when I'm done with them), user support, and so on. (Bluntly, I'm
currently having to drop all the way out to DOS to sign things
right now, and I don't think the Premier's office would be too wild
about such a prospect. They're probably all Windows people, so they'll
run the Windows version, if they use it at all.
   Bob Rae is the premier of Ontario, not the prime minister (though
in French, he would be "le premier ministre" of Ontario). Oh. What
is cypherpunks thought on having two Rae keys? Many business people
have photocopied signatures (or digitized) for relatively unimportant
mailings... Can a key be shared among the premier and his confidential
secretary, say, with another for legal matters and a third for private
communications?

Mea culpa. I was thrown by the US government's free use of it (I think
they get that, don't they?). On a silly note, my government is not
currently making money, and could hardly be classified as being in
business. ;)
