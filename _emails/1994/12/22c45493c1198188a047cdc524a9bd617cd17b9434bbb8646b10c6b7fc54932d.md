I'm interested in these figures, too, since I'm currently trying to set up
a remailer at our local computing centre -- the first argument against it
was the lack of bandwidth, since the whole university is using two 64 kBit 
lines and these guys hope to get an 2 MBit line if they say "no" often 
enough...

It would be great if you could also give me some figures to compare with, f.e. 
something like "using WWW for one hour equals one day of normal remailer 
operation" (blind guess).

And, last question: Is there some sort of a FAQ or HOWTO "How to convince 
operators of the necessity / usefulness / non-evilness of anonymous remailers"?
					  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
					  (Is this a proper english word?)
 
Since this is my first posting to this list, I'll say something about myself:
I'm studying Sociology and Law at the Universitaet Bielefeld / Germany and 
sit too much in front of computers/X-Terminals. I'm not good at programming
and no mathematical genius (or whatever a Cypherpunk should be) -- I'm rather
generally interested in security and using cryptography.
Currently I'm trying to translate the docs for SFS, but I'm not too fast at 
that...
