'punksters,

Far more interesting than Oceania is the Millennial Project. It is
not only in it's second revised edition, but has a very active BBS
and hopes to be a list on the net soon (there looking for an assist
with this so anyone who can help them out, would be appreciated)

They have also had two national gatherings, and the group has
numerous engineers running various planning committees, and they
have downloadable spreadsheets on various aspects. It is a definate
breath of fresh air from all the doomsayers out there.

 They also have a healthy respect for privacy and encryption. The
book is available at any good bookstore.

 "The Millennial Project" seven easy steps to colonizing the Galaxy
by Marshall Savage.
