Obviously, from reading Cypherpunks you'd get the idea that 
everybody has PGP and all but a few old fogies have MIME :-)
However, one of the reasons that few people actually are using
PGP signatures on all their messages is that there's no real need -
most of us realistically aren't trying to overthrow our governments,
except through obsolescence and ridicule, and there isn't much problem
with forging postings on the net.  On the other hand, if my credit
card were involved, I'd certainly be happy to start signing all my
fv payment confirmations, especially if there were a convenient tool for doing so that 
got distributed free....
