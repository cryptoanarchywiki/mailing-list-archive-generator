Child support, vagrancy, alimony, using cash instead of plastic, parking
tickets, income taxes, state taxes, municipal taxes, tax taxes,
environmental terrorism (remember that tree in your yard you cut down?),
jaywalking, having a hole in your sneakers, picking your nose, Un-American
activities (ie, disagreeing with the Kongress), Tax Fraud (ie, trying not to
give any more your money than you have to to the Tax Gestapo), reading books
on the Prohibited Publications List, Violation of National Health Policy
(ie, eating junk food, or otherwise placing an 'undue burden' on the
National Health Kare System), and any other kind of mopery and dopery they
can think up.
If you can think of it or do it, they'll make it illegal, immoral, or
Socially Irresponsible.
