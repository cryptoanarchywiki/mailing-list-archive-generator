I have noticed that folks with a Unix background have a rather
higher tolerance for stuff that sort of works, most of the time,
if you fiddle enough, than folks with Dos/Windows/Mac background

I suspect brain damage caused by a "make" utility that treats
spaces as semanticly different from tabs.  AAargh!

:-)

(But I am not an operating system bigot, I will freely admit
that segments and REPE CMPS have led to disturbing mental
symptoms amongst us PC folk.)

But seriously folks, GUI tools for manipulating and communicating
information are just wonderfully superior.  MIME etc provides a
standard for such things.

Problem is of course that it does not yet provide an entirely
satisfactory reality.  The standard is not yet standard.

Which is why you are probably reading this in a monospaced
font with hard carriage returns, rather than the proportionally
spaced font and soft line breaks that you get in the WWW
