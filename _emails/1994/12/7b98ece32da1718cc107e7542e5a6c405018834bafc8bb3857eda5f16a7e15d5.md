I can't speak for what Sandy S. meant, but I can assure you that a
"broadcast polygraph" is not planned, nor is it likely to be
technologically feasible any time soon.

The basic technology is for position localization, not vital sign
reporting, etc. To be sure, a vital signs subsystem could be linked to
another system (as could a polygraph, with a lot of effort). But such
is not the main intended purpose.
