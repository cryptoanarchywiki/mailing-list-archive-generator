| Well folks, now that more people are signing messages, how about every once
| and a while posting your key? It's kind of a drag having to hit the
| keyservers.

	Especially when your key isn't on the servers.

The following procmail rules & shell script automatically request keys
for messages that come in signed where you don't have the key.
Doesn't address multiple keyrings.  Do what you want with the returns,
I dump 'em into a folder to look at now and again.  You might pipe
them to pgp -fka or somesuch.
