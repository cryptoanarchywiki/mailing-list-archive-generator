	I hate to remind everyone, but it is possible to actually
inspect the compiled binary output by hand with a debugger and even
trace its execution step by step through the usually small security
sensitive sections of code.  While Thompson's famous hack was clever
indeed, it basically depended on security by obscurity - if someone had
looked at the generated machine code they easily could have spotted the
hook that inserted the magic password.  Granted of course this is a lot
of work, but so is modifying a compiler or perhaps several of them
to selectively insert security hooks. 

	On the other hand Eric's point about execs is more telling
however, if the evil sysadmin controls the kernal it is quite possible
for him to arrange to have the kernal recognize when the security
program code is running and fudge the state of the security code
variables by interupting its execution at a private to the kernal
breakpoint and invoking code that patches the state of the data or stack
areas and then returns to the user code.  Since the user process is
effectively running on a virtual machine it would be very difficult to
create code that would reliably detect such selective violations in the
consistancy of the virtual machine, especially as code to check for such
violations has to run on the same virtual machine and can also be
diddled with by the kernel. 

	In fact if the kernal one is running security code under is
not 100% trustworthy no amount of cleverness at the user level
can prevent it from obtaining any private information or modifying
any private data it wants.  And if the hacker is clever enough this
can be made nearly invisible to any application program and can be
used to do almost anything desired.

	And since the kernal (/vmunix or whatever) files are accessible
to anyone with root and are not integrity checked on bootup, such a hack
could be planted by some j. random hacker who had root momentarily and
activated much later (perhaps via an obscure user level control file
somewhere that specified the gory details of what to recognize and
patch).
