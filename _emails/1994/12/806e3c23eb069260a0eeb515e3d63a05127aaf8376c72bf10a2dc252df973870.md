Once more, with feeling:

It is NOT an either/or.  In the First Virtual system, the credit card
number NEVER GOES OVER THE NET AT ALL, which means that it doesn't go
over the net in the clear AND it doesn't go over the net encrypted.  

Please check out info@fv.com or URL http://www.fv.com for more
information.  -- Nathaniel
