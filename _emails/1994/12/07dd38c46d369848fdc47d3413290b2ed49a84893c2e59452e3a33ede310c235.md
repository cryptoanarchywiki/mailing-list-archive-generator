 Well Im not one (a us cit i mean), but another way of putting what I said is

 Its like some private company invents a cipher

 and you break it


 And they get pissed at you for doing it.

 But you did them a favour really cause someone more unscrupulous than you wouldnt
 have told them.

 So the NSA should be glad, and encourage us to speak like this and I think we should
 continue along this track!

 Unless of course they wish to comment....?
