If you check their WWW page, you will find information on the Secure Sockets
Layer.  It explains the algorythm used (RC4) and key size (40 bits).  The
specification is available from a web page off of their site.  With the
latest version of Netscape, you can enable a "secure" connection with their
site.  To do so use:  https://home.mcom.com/   as the home page address.
(You need at least .96 to do this.)

I am not certain as to their key exchange protocol...
