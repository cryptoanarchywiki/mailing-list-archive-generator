"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice, and let me remind
you, moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."
 -- Karl Hess
 
Meeting at Cheviot Hills (in Los Angeles) CALIFORNIA U-S-A-
I will leave town right after this meeting -- to visit relatives
and possibly attend this year's RSA conference January 9-11.
 
      The following text was written by SEK3 (with notes by JKH):
              ---   K A R L   H E S S   C L U B   ---

ANARCHIST ALTERNATIVES
 
...and alternative anarchists. Agorists, Discordians, anarcho-
syndicalists and punks -- cypher and rock. Does "dropping out" of
the hopeless aboveground political system mean less activism -- or
more? Is it time to move from the back-room to the coffeehouse?
- From the conference committee room to the Usenet? Does feminism
mean sharing the same oppression experienced by most males? Does
voting for socialism mean bureaucratic capitalism and does voting
for free enterprise mean profit...for bureaucrats?
   Did you vote for change last month...and get betrayed already?
Are you ready to get angry...or get even? Or just get something
done! If so, come and hear our panel of real alternatives: from
(De)center, IWW, and the new improved and revitalized Movement of
the Libertarian Left. Find out what's already going on all around
you.
   At Hasmik's in Cheviot Hills (West L.A.). Make sure you are on
our mailing list to get the postcard giving you the details!
   Call (310) 289-4126 or send your mail drop to KHC c/o AI, 291 S.
La Cienega Blvd., #749, Beverly Hills, CA 90211.
(Or e-mail to j.hastings6@genie.geis.com) - JKH
 
Same time and place, next month:
3. Monday, January 16, 1995
"THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 16TH"
 
What have the Objectivists been up to since the death of Ayn Rand?
Successors, institutes, new associations...some of whom are
actually eager to dialog with libertarians and others. Have they
something new for us to consider? Should we go back to our
philosophical roots first before wasting more time on inherently
impossible solutions? Is A still A? On this most special night for
objectivists, come and find out.
