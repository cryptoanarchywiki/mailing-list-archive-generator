I'm not entirely sure, but I thought that 90% of the "anti-sig" argument was
that it was a pain in the ass because the tools did not exist on some machines
to allow relatively seamless signing for some users (in a secure fashion).

If thats the case.....isn't it an equal pain in the ass to go to the trouble of
forging a sig? :> You would likely have to go through more key strokes and
other routines to forge one. Why not just play by the rules and sign a
message?
