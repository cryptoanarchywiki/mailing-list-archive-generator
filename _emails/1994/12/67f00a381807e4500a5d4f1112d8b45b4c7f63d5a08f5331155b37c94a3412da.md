PGP has made me more crypto aware, but at this point neither I nor most of
the crypto aware people I personally know feel there is a need to either
encrypt or sign messages on a regular basis.  While this doesn't do great
things for supporting crypto, it is simply reality.  DigiCash is a
different situation of course - it is needed, and as soon as possible.
