I imagine it would be a breeze to attach a forged PGP sig to every message
using most mailers etc. The signature block is easy -- simply append it to 
the contents of the .sig autoappended by many mailers/newsreaders. All that
remains is a macro or a bit of cutting & pasting to toss in the --- BEGIN PGP
line at the top.

Now that Eric has made it abundantly clear he envisions syntactic but not
semantic checks of sigs, I am opposed to the proposition. I foresee a
situation in which a large portion of the list traffic uses forged or
meaningless signing-server-appended dig sigs. When I establish automatic
signature validation for incoming mail here Real Soon Now, there will be 
plenty of noise generated by all the `false' negatives in the data to make
a mockery of the authentication process. Encouraging cryptographically
valid signatures was the first suggestion I'd seen in this entire debate
which seemed to promise tangible benefits; encouraging cryptographically
invalid signatures is the first notion which appears to offer tangible
detriment.

Disclaimer acronym of the day: ECDWHW. Eric Can Do Whatever He Wants.

BTW, Tim, why do you seem so surprised by JD's style of discourse ?
Just mention Chomsky and be done with the damn thing, it's not going to
be productive anyway.
