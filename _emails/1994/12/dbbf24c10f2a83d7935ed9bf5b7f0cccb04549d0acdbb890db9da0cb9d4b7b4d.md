HE IS AT IT AGAIN!!! I know that the anonymous messages are
obvious, but in fact I think detweiler is posting ALL KINDS OF
TENTACLE GRAMS UNDER THE "MANDATORY SIGNATURE" THREAD UNDER 
VARIOUS ADDRESSES, mounting a flamewar of Detweilerian 
proportions!!!

STOP POSTING UNDER THIS THREAD IMMEDIATELY!!! you are PLAYING
INTO DETWEILER'S PLOY OF BRINGING CHAOS, ANARCHY AND DISUNITY 
TO THE CYPHERPUNK LIST!!! he is posting the messages that
look "reasonable" but are really SUBTLE FLAMEBAIT. have you
noticed all the unusual people posting lately??? they are
DETWEILER TENTACLES!!!!
