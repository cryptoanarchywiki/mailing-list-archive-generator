Schneir mentions MMB in the section following IDEA (in 11.10) of _Applied_
_Cryptography_, but notes that it's brand-spanking new at the time of
_AC_'s publication.  He mentions that "Eli Biham thinks that a 128-bit
block size actually weakens the algorithm."

What's the current thought on MMB?  Has it undergone serious analysis
and if so, what's the conclusion been?

Thanks,
