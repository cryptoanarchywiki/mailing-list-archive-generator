I would be fairly surprised if this weren't the case, since it allows trial 
decryption to be done completely without human intervention.  This would speed 
up the cycle time (and reduce the resources needed) for decrypting intercepts, 
with more reliability than a straight statistical check on the candidate 
plaintext.
