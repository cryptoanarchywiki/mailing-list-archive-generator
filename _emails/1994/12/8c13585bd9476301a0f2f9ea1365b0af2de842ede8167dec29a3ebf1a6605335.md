I'm watching a congressional hearing on C-SPAN about the 
"Computer Criminal Tracking System."  Jim Martin of the National
Consortium for Justice Information and Statistics is testifying,
describing an FBI database under development.  As an example of
its intended use, he gave the following example:  A hitchhiker
could be stopped by police and required to submit fingerprints.
These fingerprints could transmitted digitally to obtain 
instant identification and "criminal history" information about
the hitchhiker.  Criminal history information would include 
information from federal, state, and local authorities.

Mr. Martin also observed that, while existing Justice Information
databases are now used only for law-enforcement, firearms licensing, 
and "national security purposes,"  he envisions that the new 
database could be expanded in its uses to include "non-criminal justice" 
applications.



Why should I have to provide fingerprint identification on demand to 
cops?

What are the "national security" applications of existing databases?

Imagine all the potential "non-criminal justice" applications for the
new database.

What happens when this database gets linked up to the "citizen 
tracking and employment eligibility" database under construction?
Do we then have a de facto (cardless) national ID?  I think so.
