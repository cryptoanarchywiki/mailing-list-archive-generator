As I've explained to Eric privately, I was the victim of a little
editorial activism.  The sentence about "the Cypherpunks' 'anonymous
remailer,' list," is not mine.  My original text included a longer
description of remailers, which the editors decided to elide for the
sake of brevity.  This was done without my consent.

As to "other errors," please clarify.  I certainly had no intention of
casting Cypherpunks in a bad light.
