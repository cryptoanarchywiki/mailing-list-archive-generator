Thats what that thing was susposed to be. I got the same things with 
pine, which I know is susposed to be mime aware. Anyway all this talk 
about it gave me an idea. A PGP mime extention, where your mail says that 
you have a PGP encoded message, enter secret pass phrase to contiue. I 
think this would do a couple of things

	First get PGP installed on more machines. Sys Admins who install 
	MIME aware applications would almost be required to install PGP
	beacuse it is a part of MIME.

	Secone more people would be introduced to PGP. The first time they
	use a MIME aware application ie. PINE they would be given a 
	message that they do not have a public/private key set up, ect. 
	That time could be used to explain the basics of encryption, 
	public/private key's, and security issuse of using PGP. 

	Third PGP would be more frequently used beacuse it would be right 
	there with there E-Mail, ect. It would not require as much work 
	to set up beacuse the programs could prompt to do things
	... Do you want to encrypt this E-Mail with the recipiants public 
	key [Yn] ...
