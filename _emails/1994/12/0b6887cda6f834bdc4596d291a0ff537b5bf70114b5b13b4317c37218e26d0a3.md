You, perhaps, but not me. They are publishing it as an informational
RFC to get an end run around the IETF process in my opinion -- they
fully intend for people to use the protocol on a non-experimental
basis, so it isn't just "information". I may try to have a talk with
the IESG and Postel before this publication happens.
