They've resumed.  The partners had a falling out of some sort, and
the "Eric Klein" one has progressed.

The Oceania posts for the last n months can be read via NNTP from
nntp.hks.net, newsgroup hks.lists.oceania.

They're getting more productive than that.  The current plan is that
they're trying to help launch a business that designs and builds sea
structures.  They've got some pretty good ideas, and are focusing now
more on the idea of producing small tangible results that may one day
build to their desired goal.

I'm still skeptical as to their chances for success, though, but if
enough people with some pragmatic sense get sucked in, there is a chance...
