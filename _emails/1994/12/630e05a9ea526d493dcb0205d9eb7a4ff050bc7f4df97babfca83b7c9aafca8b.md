We haven't heard from Peter Gutmann yet (probably because he is so busy), but
if he turns up it would be interesting to hear about any future plans for SFS.
I don't mind explaining a little bit about some areas of cryptanalysis, maybe
the various sieves. Chris might want to talk about some hardware ideas.

>PS:  Why do we need a workstation? (probably a dumb question)

To try stuff out, play with programs, broadcast the nonsense worldwide over 
the net <grin> ...
We don't need one, we just need people who have a common interest and 
something to say about it.
