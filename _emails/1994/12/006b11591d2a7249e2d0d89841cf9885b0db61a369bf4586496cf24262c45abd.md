>      Once upon a time, there was an Emperor.  He had been voted
> into office fairly easily, because he had managed to impress people
> with his brain.  But once he realized that the job demanded more,
> he said, "My brain is too small!"  So he had posters hung on every
> blank wall in the kingdom, proclaiming the need for skilled neural
> surgeons/tailors to weave him a new, better, bigger brain.  "Soon,"
> he thought, "I will have a good brain and will be able to govern my
> empire properly, and all the people will love me, and I'll be so
> cool that there'll be chicks hanging around me all the time...
> Maybe I'll even get a car, or put up the bestest BBS in the
> world..." and so on.  What he didn't know what that he was saying
> all of this out loud, and that a small band of rogues had been
> shadowing him for the duration of his monologue.  When the Emperor
> had left to pursue other activities, due to the rather self-
> exciting nature of his mostly derailed train of thought, the rogues
> spoke amongst themselves.
>      "Will you listen to that, mate?" commented NSA.  "The poor
> chap really hasn't got a clue!"
>      "Yeah, let's put him out of our misery," remarked FBI.
>      "Be quiet, will you?" said CIA.  "You dolt, don't you see the
> prospects here?  We can rule this place.  NSA and NIST have the
> plan.  Where is NIST, anyway?"
>      "He'll be along, shortly.  He had some business with that
> hotshot DES.  Chopped half of DES's - thing - off, he did.  Ugly
> business," replied NSA.

>      The Emperor jumped.  "What?!?  Oh!  Okay, I'll be down

>      "No, Sire," the page replied immediately.

> bring you all the doors, window blinds and roofs in the kingdom,

>      "Yeah, but there's also the matter of payment," said CIA.
>      NSA spoke.  "We understand that you have, in the castle

>      "But those are the only ones in the kingdom!  We have saved

>      FBI stood to his full, rather impressive height, and looked
> down at the suddenly small-feeling Emperor.  "This is what's best
> for the kingdom, isn't it?  You need a brain, and we need the
> potions.  Do you really want to argue?"
>      "Uh... of course not." was the meek response.
>      "Good.  Now that that's settled-" began NSA.
>      "But what if the peasants want to keep their roofs and doors
> and blinds?" interrupted the Emperor.
>      NSA confidently replied, "They won't.  We'll make sure that
> they know it's all for the common good.  Besides, those things are
> only needed to conceal things.  People who have nothing to hide
> have no cause to resent this, do they?  Besides, if against all

> we can help you take care of your subjects.  They will look up to
> us as kindly Big Brothers."
>      "I'm quite capable of taking care of the kingdom myself,"
> asserted the Emperor.
>      "Nonsense," CIA remarked.  "We're the ones building you this
> brain, right?"
>      "Right," the Emperor acquiesced, though he wasn't quite sure
> that the conclusion followed logically from this.  He felt there
> was something slightly wrong, but since he could not tell what, he
> decided not to risk making a fool of himself.

>      At the scoundrels' insistence, the Emperor ordered every
> construction worker in the kingdom to work on the dismantling of

> suffer, as roads crumbled, and prices rose, while the economy began
> a slow but accelerating collapse.  Just inside the castle, a ragged
> collection of peasants met with the Emperor.
>      "Why are your goons doing this to us?" cried one woman.  "I

>     And old man spoke up.  "Without a roof, we can't keep the

>      Suddenly four towering figures entered, and herded the

>      "My kingdom is collapsing!" cried the Emperor.
>      "And we know why!" exclaimed FBI.  "There are secret societies
> of witches that oppose us.  But our spies, KGB and Mccarthy, have
> been rooting them out.  That is what the fires are for."
>      "But you're burning the wood that you said you would save!"
>      "SO WHAT?!?!?!?"
>      "Okay, as long as you put it that way.  What about my brain?"
>      This caught FBI by surprise, for he had completely forgotten
> about the deal.  Luckily, CIA happened to be in the room, and
> glibly replied, "The chemical reactions going on right now are the
> final processes in the construction of the brain."
>      "Oh, goody."  The prospect of the new brain cheered up the
> Emperor, and he forgot about his dying kingdom.

>      "What is its relevance to witchcraft?"

> probably time to invite the Emperor back into the castle."
>      At their call, his Excellency dutifully entered.  "We finished
> your brain last night, and implanted it while you were sleeping in

> from pure energy (released by the burning wood), weighs virtually
> nothing.  We fashioned it in such a way that only a person without
> personal problems can see it, so that you may judge this
> characteristic in people with ease."
>      FBI held up a mirror to facilitate the Emperor's viewing of
> his new brain.  "How do you like it?"
>      Though he saw nothing but his own reflection, he said, "It is
> a good brain.  I like the laurels particularly.  Let's hold a

>      A wave of excitement swept through the crowd, as the arrival
