In my view, delaying unsigned messages is only moderately better than
dropping them.  It punishes users for having non-crypto-friendly email
setups (and makes things somewhat more confusing for other list readers,
even the ones who sign their messages).

Yes, but you are denying the way in which delaying, like bouncing,
actively interferes with the timely forwarding of non-signers' messages,
while merely marking them is a more passive form of harrassment.  Yes,
there is a distinction between delaying and bouncing.  There is also a
distinction between battery and homicide.

You keep insisting that delaying unsigned messages does not interfere
with non-signers' abilities to participate in the discussion.  I say you
are wrong.  It's a positive hindrance.  It punishes people for
circumstances that may well be beyond their control.  It's a bad idea.

You maintain the list, you can do what you want.  As you can plainly see
(Tim's right on this one), I sign my posts to the list, and my posts
would get the favored treatment.  No one can stop you; but if you do
something that makes valued contributors take a walk, you wouldn't be
doing the list any favors.

(Are you going to make sure that all the signatures are valid, or will
you accept someone sticking a PGP signature into their .sig and using it
over and over?)
