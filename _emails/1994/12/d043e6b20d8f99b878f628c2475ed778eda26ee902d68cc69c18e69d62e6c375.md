Well, it's what Apple is using for PowerTalk signers (which are a key pair and 
X.509 certificates, by default from the Unaffiliated User PCA).  It makes 
sense for personal (as opposed to organizational) servers, such as someone 
running MacHTTP for their home page...

On the other hand, if RSA has set up a server PCA, that should be suffcient 
for now.  I wonder what the certification policy is, though--how do you prove 
that you control a given server?  For an Unaffiliated User CA certificate, you 
just have to show a notarized application and two forms of ID, one with a 
photo (driver's license, passport, etc.).  I can't off hand think of an 
equivalently strong way to ID control of a server...
