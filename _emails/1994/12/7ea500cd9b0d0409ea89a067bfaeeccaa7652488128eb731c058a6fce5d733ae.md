    A fair summary of the situation. And I consider the slight benefits of
    signing to not be worth the effort of changing the tools I  have
    managed to get working over the past couple of years.

I think that solution is clear: Buy your own netcom.

You don't need the size, so just buy a 486 and a domain name
(cypherpunks.org?).  Then, hire a CP hacker to Linuxize the 486,
slip/ppp it to some provider, and hook-up premail et al.  Anyone
selling Linux support contracts yet?

You can continue to do what you currently do on your Mac.  You'll just
be tcmay@cypherpunks.org instead of tcmay@netcom.com and you'll have
some crypto bells and whistles that you didn't have before.
