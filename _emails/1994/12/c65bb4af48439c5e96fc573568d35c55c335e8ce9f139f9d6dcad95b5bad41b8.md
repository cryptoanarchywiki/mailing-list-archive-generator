Steven Levy discussed key escrow with Terry Gross on NPR's Fresh Air today
(the show originates at WHYY-FM in Philadelphia). Unfortunately I only 
caught the tail end of the interview, as I happened to flip to the local
public radio station driving home. He drew the analogy between Clipper/EES 
and being required to leave a key to the "strong door" of one's house at the 
local police station. 

Towards the end he specifically mentioned the cypherpunks as a group working
against this sort of encroachment on privacy.

Perhaps someone could fill in more details from the beginning of the 
conversation ?
