Ohh, I misinterpreted. You're talking about a high level interface that
assumes cryptographic operations are already being used for specific
purposes (ie. `signature', `GetMIC', `VerifyMIC', `Wrap', `Unwrap').

I was thinking more about the layer below this, the primitive operations 
that don't make assumptions on what the user is going to do; and 
limitations placed thereupon.

ps.

In the middle of the year I worked on a Radio Show that delved into the
PGP and Clipper debarcle, it was titled `Tales from the Crypt'.
Subsequently I submitted it for a Government sponsored contest for
excellence in technical, science and engineering journalism. I found
out yesterday that I've taken out a prize for the best work conducted
by someone under the age of 26. There is a certain irony in being
awarded the prize by a Government department :-).
