Won't happen.  First, cops are already required to enforce some
stupid laws; the mechanism used is "quotas."  Second, the vast
number of laws makes total enforcement impossible.  Third, the
cops aren't pulling a fast one when they use their discretion to
cut someone loose.  I've even seem them do it on the TV show
"COPS."  That discretion is clearly within their powers.  It's
the "let's-whack-the-hippie" sort of discretion that is denied
them.

    ... I have some good opinions of the California Highway
    Patrol ... even a cop-disliking skeptic like me can be
    convinced that some good is done is by them, and that
    not all cops are bad....

I agree; and Mussolini did make the trains run on time . . .

My proposal is not anti-cop; it's anti- *bad* cop.  Good cops
*benefit* from protective surveillance; and *all* cops benefit
from having their exact location known when the feces impacts the
turbine.
