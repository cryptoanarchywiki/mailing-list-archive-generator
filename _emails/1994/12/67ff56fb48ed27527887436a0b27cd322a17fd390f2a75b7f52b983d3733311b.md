That would make this counterparty pseudonymity, not anonymity.  The merchant,  
while not knowing the true identity of his clients, is still able to  
correlate the transactions of individual accounts (and must be able to under  
FV's policies).  A malicious merchant, for instance, could recognize that a  
particular account is more interested in certain types of information and  
charge accordingly.
