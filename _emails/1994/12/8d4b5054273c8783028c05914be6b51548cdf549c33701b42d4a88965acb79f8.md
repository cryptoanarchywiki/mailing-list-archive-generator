If the technology is so "bad", would someone please be so kind as to
inform us what is so "bad" about it? We have a solution for a piece of
the security puzzle: transport security. We admit its
limitations. People keep saying its "bad".

Please put some meat behind the commentary:

Is it insecure? If so, how?

Is there some cipher techonology that it absolutely must support? If
so, which one? why?

etc.
