It is my own personal opinion that in order for crypto to truly become 
mainframe, the software manufacturers of internet connectivity packages must 
integrate crypto into the applications.  Look at the past threads here on 
Cypherpunks..."How do I write a script to put PGP into ELM?"  "PGP DLL 
modularity" etc.

In order to bring crypto to the masses, we have got to convince people that it 
is necessary.  We also must make it "second nature".  It sure is nice to have 
a menu option or a toolbar button that will encrypt plaintext automatically.  
Key management and some of the "high tech"  (I know, for us it's nothing, but 
for my dad who just bought a computer and doesn't understand the difference 
between click, double click, and drag, crypto is a really high tech thing just 
in itself.) things of crypto should not be directly handled by the user.  
(Optional of course.  On a privacy level, the user should have full control.  
But give the user a break...if the software is secure..as such...so is the 
user's privacy.)

You will notice that this message is not signed.  That's because in order to 
sign it, I would need to save my message, hop out to a DOS box, PGP encrypt 
it, hop back to my mail program and insert the encrypted mail as a text file.  
That's enough to discourage the average user.  This is pretty much what Tim 
May was talking about when he discussed why he doesn't sign his messages.  
It's not that he couldn't... it's just not practical for him.  It's not really 
practical for me either, but I do it when I feel it's necessary.

The only way to make crypto practical is to basicalloy hide the technical side 
from the user and make it easy.  

That's my two cents.
