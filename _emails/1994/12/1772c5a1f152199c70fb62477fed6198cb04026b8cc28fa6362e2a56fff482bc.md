Mr. Anonymous the Anti-Mime should be very embarassed indeed:

Mr. Anonymous seems to believe that MIME is a way to associate documents
with apps so that they start up on double-click! :-D

I don't really understand the need for such a huge 10% thread (SNR 1:10) on 
MIME of all things (with most of it concentrating on transmitting pictures 
and using dumb terminals). I have my own domain name and access the Net at 
24+ kbps from multiple platforms all capable of running MIME, but I don't 
post in MIME.

I agree with Tim that it's only rarely that MIME could add value to posts
on this list. When MIME readers do PGP nicely, then it would be something for
Cypherpunks to scream about.
