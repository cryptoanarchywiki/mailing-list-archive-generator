Ah, a litmus test at the door for DigitaLiberty's version of political
correctness in order to see if one is worthy to speak (or listen).
So much for all the rhetoric about liberty and freedom: by #2, you've just
ruled out everyone who works in any federal, state or local government
agency, defense, aerospace and communications contractors, public
universities and schools...shall I go on?

Hmmm, and by #1 you've also ruled out anyone who supports their local
police department.  I presume, then, that you won't be calling them should
someone threaten your person or possessions.

Your forum isn't about *our* digital liberty, it's about *your*
personal political agenda -- why not come right out and clearly label
it as such, rather than disguising it?
