Not just yet; they're currently arguing about this on the pem-dev

Nope, the IETF stds track is Proposed Standard -> Draft Standard -> Standard

Right, but with its preoccupation with negotiation, it seems to be
more oriented towards securing the *transaction* rather than the
*document*.

There are at least three different layers at which HTTP and "the web"
can be secured:

1) - the *transport* (and lower) -- secured by IPSP and/or SSL 
2) - the *transaction* (e.g, authentication for access control)
3) - the *document* (e.g., authentication by the document's author)

The difference between (1) and (2) becomes obvious when proxies are
involved.  Doing (2) complicates distributed caching, while (1) and
(3) don't really get in the way of caches.

Frankly, I think that the web needs (3), then (1), and only later (2).
