Flash/ANSI Bomb/terminal codes or just general screwups can be quite a pain.
Though the methods suggested above may work in some circumstances, they won't
work all the time. One method I have found to be quick and highly effective
is the following alias (shown from my bash rcfile, but you can easily
translate to other shells):

## This last one is a nifty little way to fix the terminal after being
## flashed or otherwise messed up by some program.  If your terminal is
## really screwed up, it may not be able to parse the return (^M) correctly.
## If so, use linefeed (^J), then type "sanity", then type another linefeed.
alias sanity='stty 500:5:96c:3b:0:3:1c:8:17:4:0:0:0:500:5:96c:8000003b:3:1c:8:17
:4:0:0:0:ff:ff:ff:4:0:1a:11:13:0:0:1a:ff'

(N.B.: make sure that is one line for the alias).  Unfortunately this does
assume that your terminal is at least semi-clued (i.e. minimal vt100 features,
but it should be able to get your back to a sane setup wherein you can re-
source your own rcfiles or set the terminal paramters yourself.  There is
also a script called unflash which will fix basic terminal codes attacks, 
but it is less robust (it just echos {esc}c {esc}0 and clears the screen,
which will end text properties but not neccesarily fix status lines and
other problems).

If you use it, let me know how this generalizes, its been quite stable in
my experience.  The real tough one to deal with is xterm, which can have
font properties set through escape codes, a well designed talk request,
terminal write, or irc bomb can make it entirely unintelligible and very
difficult to recover.  Get you admin to install a good fingerd/talkd
and/or use mesg n to prevent access in the first place.  There are several
around now which disallow terminal codes in the talk requesters id and
check IPs, etc.
