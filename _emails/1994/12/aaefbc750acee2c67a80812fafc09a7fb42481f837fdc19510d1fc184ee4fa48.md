15 years ago, I was a 9 year old in the fifth grade who called the teacher a 
"nasty" name and was told to write 500 sentences as a reprimand.  I asked if 
they could be typed, she said yes.  So, I prompt;y went up to the 40 column 
display on the Apple IIe and wrote a four line, Apple Basic program that would 
repeatedly print 500 sentences saying, "It is not right to call the teacher 
names."  When I handed it to her, she new she'd been set up.  That didn't go 
over well as I remember.

Anyway, that's not really what I wanted to say.  I wanted to say that as a 
company that writes a Mail package.  One of the biggest complaints of our 
customers has been lack of MIME support.  Also, we have been severely "wrist 
slapped" for not formatting our mail messages to 80 characters so "normal 
people" could read it on their mail readers.  So, my point, the market right 
now is for MIME support and user setting message widths.  You can't please 
everyone all the time.

Japanese characters are considerably different.  I've been on some Japanese 
news servers that you just can't read with a normal news reader just because 
they require graphical Japanese characters.  (Kanji, Katakana, or Hiragana ... 
depends on the group.)  By the way, I was testing a news reader, I can't read 
Kanji.
