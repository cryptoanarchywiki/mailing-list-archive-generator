There is a difference between believing that something is wrong (a moral
stance), and believing that force should be used to stop it (a ban).  A
consistent position, for someone believing remailers are bad, would be that
they personally wouldn't run a remailer or tell other people how to
do so.  It would not require advocating bans on remailers.

And trying to _convince_ other people not to do something, without the
threat of force, is not _banning_.
