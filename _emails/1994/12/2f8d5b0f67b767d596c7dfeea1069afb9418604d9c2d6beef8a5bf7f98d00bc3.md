   Can't be too UNIX centric.  With the advent of MS Mail and CC:Mail that 
have SMTP gateways, they automagically convert uuencoded files to 
attachments in the native format.  That is, when you send me a message with 
a uuencoded file at the end, my mail gateway uudecodes and puts the 
attachemnt in my mail messas as a clickable icon.  NOW,  all you got to do 
is convince me to doubble click on this (virus exe) and bingo!, I'm dead.

Question:

   Has anyone tried to infect or destroy an NT box with some known virus. 
 NT's security model could prevent this (I.E. trying to write to a 
restricted file or stay resident...).  But I'm not sure what is secured 
since almost all users use NT workstation as "Administrator".
