>I was wondering what is the legal status for using rsaref outside usa.
>Is it legal or not?

Depends on whether RSA has a patent in that country... I know of no
countries besides the U.S.A. that have a patent on RSA. Using exact code may
also violate copyright...that is a tougher matter to prove...but copyright
treaties allow some level of international protection...use with care.

>Also, what is the legal status of RC4 code posted to the net?
It was a trade secret. It is no longer...Copyright issues still are still a
problem, but ask an attorney in your country if you are going to use it in a
commercial program.
