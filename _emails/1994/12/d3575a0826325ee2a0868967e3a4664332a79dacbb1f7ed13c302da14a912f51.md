>Philosophically, I see most journalists as being filters. Some of us
>read press releases, strip out the propaganda, and supply the results
>(with interpretation) to the public. Some of us go and try to nail
>down the story by poking around and asking questions. But ultimately
>we rely on sensory input at some level -- and all we do is rearrange
>it, comment on it (by referring to prior input), and punt it out again
>at our readers.  This is fundamentally an editorial process, and there
>will be more need for it -- not less -- as the information deluge
>gathers momentum.
>
>There's a huge problem on the net: how does copyright apply to a reference?
>For example: I can't stitch a Far Side cartoon into my WWW home page. But
>I _can_ embed an <IMG SRC= ...> directive in my page, pointing to a Far
>Side cartoon that is _legitimately_ stored somewhere else on the net. When
>you look at my page you will see the cartoon ... and will have a bit of a
>headache when you stop to think about the copyright implications.
>
>The precise question of what constitutes a copyright violation runs
>into a wall of mud as soon as you start asking questions about sources
>and hyperlinks. For example, here's the kind of havoc you can wreak by
>classifying all embedded link dereferences as deliberate actions.
>Suppose I am a cop in some redneck area, and I want to nail someone
>who uses the net locally.  I could run a _very_ neat entrapment sting
>to nail people for posession of kiddie porn:
>
>*       establish a local WWW server hosting some useful information
>*       configure the server to record the IP addresses of people who
>        access it, and cross-reference them to obtain geographical
>        locations as registered with NIC. Feed this into a GIS and
>        track local accesses.
>*       have a list of people who I want  to nail.
>*       filter all HTTP requests through a script that
>        -       checks the list of victims
>        -       if a request for a file comes in from one of the
>                targets, munge the outgoing web page to include
>                a <IMG SRC= ...> tag pointing to a foreign site
>                carrying images deemed pornographic in my jurisdiction
>        -       ring the console bell
>
>As soon as someone on the hit list downloads a file, you have prima
>facie evidence that they are probably in posession of some kiddie porn.
>Instant search warrant time ...
>
>(And in case you were wondering, this is just a technology twist on top
>of the recent Adult Action BBS case in Mississippi.)
>
>Basically, as far as I can see, conventional notions of copyright are
>going to have to change -- because copying is no longer the only mechanism
>for gaining posession of information. Our notions of intellectual property
>may also have to change ...
