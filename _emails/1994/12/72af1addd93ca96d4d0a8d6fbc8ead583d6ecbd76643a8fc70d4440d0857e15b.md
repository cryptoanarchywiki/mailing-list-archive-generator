	There is, or was a couple of years ago, another reason for this. 
One of the major SIMM patents is for SIMMs with parity and does not
apply to SIMMs without (a matter of how the claims were phrased), so
companies that don't want to pay royalties to Wang in the US (the owner
of MOST SIMM patents) have used this trick not primarily to cut product
cost but to aviod paying royalties (something like 5%).
