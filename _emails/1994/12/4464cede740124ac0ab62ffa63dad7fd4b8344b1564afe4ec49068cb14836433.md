I think I've heard of that, but does it really handle makeup, beards,
severe weather (lets see, it got to actual temp of -25F last Jan. in
Dayton, OH)?

I noticed a few weeks ago that the tarmac access doors in Chi. O'Hare
have hand scanners.  At first I thought they looked like palm
scanners but upon inspection they were obviously a simple, durable,
and effective biometrics reader.  It had 3 pins you laid the arch of your
hand against and a retro reflective surface.

It's occured to me that, to go along with my Internet Doorbell (tm) ;-),
I could put a load sensor on the porch and a line of vertical
led sensors at the porch threshhold to get a highly probable biometric 
guess of a visitor.
