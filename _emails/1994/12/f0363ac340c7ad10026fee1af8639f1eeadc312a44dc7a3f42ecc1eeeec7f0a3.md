One solution, or start of a solution, is to tell the user about the 
signature checks, and how to go about verifying them in teh README text 
file, that most users come to expect in a package of software.  Or 
perhaps add into the tar and zipped packagea  file called SIGNATURECHECK 
or something suitably obvious, as well as explaining it.  I believe most 
users expect the README file enough to look in it, at least skimming it.
