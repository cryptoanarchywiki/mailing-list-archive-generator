This is out in draft form.

Just like they are almost required to install MS Word because of the
existance of application/ms-word?

Speaking as a SysAdmin, if it were a limited use item, where only a
few people wanted it, I would show the users how to set up their own
MIME handling, like metamail's .mailcap file.

Only if the user chose to send things in application/pgp (or is it
text/pgp?)  If they chose to send text/plain, they'd never have to
deal with PGP.

Forcing PGP down people's throats is not a way of winning "converts."
You need to convince them of the need, they present well-integrated
tools that make it simple.  If you try to force people to use PGP,
they'll find work-arounds and do what they can to avoid it.
