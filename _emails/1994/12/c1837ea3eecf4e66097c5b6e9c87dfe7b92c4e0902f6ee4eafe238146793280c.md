James Donald has claimed that I've been talking about vaporware and
that Netscape has produced "real cool crypto for the masses".

As I've noted, real code to implement proposals quite similar to IPSP
is out there right now, and has been for half a year. The reason that
it isn't very widely deployed is largely because we haven't been
pushing it because it isn't fully clean yet, not because it couldn't
be used. (It is indeed being used by real people with real
applications).
