Don't freak with the address... I'm moving.  Check the sig if you're paranoid.

Well, ignoring the fact that MIME appears to be infiltrating the Web as well...

I would differ with your analysis of MIME's lack of usefulness.  It does
provide a possible way to integrate PGP into the mail/Web landscape (from a
crypto standpoint).  Multimedia I'm not so sure about; I think the big draw
to MIME will come when Person A drags and drops a spreadsheet into a MIME
mailer and sends the message to Person B, who then clicks on an icon to pull
up the spreadsheet.  But I digress...

I'd say, however, that MIME isn't a done deal yet, though it's getting
there.  Until it's there, it's probably a bad idea.  It's been my experience
that many mailers are just MIME-compliant enough to cause their users lots
of headaches.

(As I write this, I notice I'm using Eudora, which MIMEs all its stuff.  Oh,
well; I hope this message isn't too much trouble for y'all...)

I vote for MIME-encoded cave drawings. :-)
