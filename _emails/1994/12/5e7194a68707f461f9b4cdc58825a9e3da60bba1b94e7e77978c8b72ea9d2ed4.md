TAKE 2!:

It's always something. Saturday, December 10, 1994,
and weekly henceforth (on a trial basis, excluding vacations and holidays
unless someone else wants to host it):

There will be a meeting under the announced name "L.A. Cypherpunks"
at the California Coffee House, 4455 Overland Avenue, Culver City,
CA 90230 (310) 559-8868 to discuss privacy issues and tactics.
 
If any of y'all want to show up and flame on about your pet projects
and sell stuff, it is a free, informal gathering -- show up any time
between noon and 5 P.M.

The first logical order of business after introductions, is "is
this the time and the place?" The California Coffee House is
close to my home, and it is a compromise between the
extremes of a restaurant and a meeting hall without food. They 
serve sandwiches and coffee. They are open 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. on
Saturday. The meeting will start if anyone shows up besides
myself and continue until closing time. And you'll even get a
little brochure! Gosh, golly, gee whiz!!
 
BCNU!
