So I was netsurfing and came across CellularOne's home page.  So I thought
I'd do a little investigative work...this is the same company which
advertises that your digital phone conversation is private even in a
crowded restaurant!  Here's what its WWW server had to say:

>The Difference Digital Makes
>
>Cellular phones play an indispensable role in everyday life in the 1990s. But
>>what exactly does digital technology bring to the table?
>
>Static meets its match. Since digital transmission only recognizes and
>converts >variations in the human voice, static is virtually eliminated.
>Voices come >through loud and clear. Background noise isn't just reduced, it's
>virtually >eliminated. So is cross-talk.
>
>Capacity three times. Ultimately, digital technology will triple the size of
>>the cellular phone information highway. So as we convert, more room will be
>>freed up for more of your important calls. Resulting in more calls going
>>through faster. On the first try. And fewer calls being dropped.
>
>Pssst, what about privacy? Again, since your voice is digitally processed,
>it's >less likely that anyone could eavesdrop on your conversations.
