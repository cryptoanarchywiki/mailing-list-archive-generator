You are right. It doesn't work with existing proxy's. But existing proxy's
can't do secure data transfers, so what's your point?

Seems like your mailer was having some difficulty :-)

In any case, my personal opinion is that NCOM is being attacked with a
catch-22. If we had kept the protocol proprietary, then we would have been
shot. We went public with it and are getting shot. If we had waited the 2.5
years to develop it, as a few here would seem to be advocating, then the market
would shoot us.

Nice place to live.
