Note that I have made no such claims. While I don't like the sound of
the proposal, for various reasons, and while I didn't care for the "If
Eric says it is so, then it is so" sycophancy, I can't find any
evidence that Eric was strutting around like a peacock, etc.

This is unlikely, as it sounds like the worst-case version of the
proposal has been shelved.

I happen to think that this "flame war," as some have characterizied
it, has made more apparent the difficulties many on the list (perhaps
most, as the Silent Majority is probably not in a better position, it
seems to me) have in routinely signing posts. I like the "under oath"
points Mike Duvos made today.

Rishab suggested we should talk about other things. Well, nothing is
stopping folks from doint so. I take the heated debate about this
"sign or else" to be a sign of health; at least some topics can still
generate furious debate.
