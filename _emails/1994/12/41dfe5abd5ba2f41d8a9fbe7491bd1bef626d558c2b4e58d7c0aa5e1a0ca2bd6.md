Heh heh. Missiles R Us in Iran can't buy target analysis software so can't 
compete in the US cruise missile market; GD needn't bother about cheaper
Iranian labour costs.

As you correctly noted later, exceptions are made for missiles (and French
movies, and US _peanuts_) - IAC US policy is to treat crypto as munitions,
or at best 'dual-use' tech. GATT does not affect other arms treaties - NPT,
MTCR, etc...
