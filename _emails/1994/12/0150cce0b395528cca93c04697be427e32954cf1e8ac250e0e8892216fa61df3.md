And what has the author done here, but involve himself in the affairs of 
our poster requesting information on Norton...?  Some privacy he afforded 
the would be norton breaker, or even norton breaker's girlfriend.

Sure, Norton breaker should have kept his mouth shut, but a small comment 
at the end of a technical post detailing norton should have taken care of 
this.  Mind your own business next time smart guy.

How much context do you have here?

I submit again, you should just mind your own business.  I hardly accept 
your judgement as to when information should or should not be released.

Had I encrypted with Norton encrypt?  I would have been deserving of 
whatever attack ensued.  When the hell are people going to take 
responsibility for themselves.  Who are you to assume anothers 
responsibility for their privacy?  What will happen when your 
paternalistic regime is on vacation?

Let's make a government crypto subsidy eh?  Obviously people are such 
idiots that they all need government to supply them with crypto.  I guess 
you'd be the head of standards?  Deciding when and who gets which methods?

I see, and if I asked how to eavesdrop on digital cellular, your position 
would be that I should not know.  Obviously I intend, or could 
distribute such information to thousands who might violate the privacy of 
millions.  Funny how the general disclosure doesn't bother you, but the 
specific disclosure, one which affects no more than perhaps three people, 
does.

I suggest you get your perspectives in order.
