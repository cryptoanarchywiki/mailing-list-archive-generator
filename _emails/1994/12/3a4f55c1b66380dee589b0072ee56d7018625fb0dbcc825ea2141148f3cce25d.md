I had to tape it, but yeah, I saw it. Seemed a bit retro-War Games type 
documentary to me also...

I also noticed that their re-enactor was wearing surgical gloves...? 
Seems a little strage since they supposed he was a teenager at home. Then 
again, perhaps he knows something about privacy that we do not? (I knew 
someone was rating out on me, never guessed it was my keyboard...)
Also, in one of the re-enactment he states," I'm in! I control the 
horizontal and the vertical..." yeah buddy, well I've got the brightness 
and contrast too...sheesh!

Perhaps The Dicovery Channel would like to know about encryption, etc. 
They listed their addres as:
