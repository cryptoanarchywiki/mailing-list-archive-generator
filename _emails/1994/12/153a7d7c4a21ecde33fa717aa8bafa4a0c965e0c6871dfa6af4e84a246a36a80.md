	Please join us at the NEXUS-Berkeley while we bring in the new
year, as it happens in New York, Chicago, Anchorage, and other cities
around the continent. (I would include here the Australian sites but
that would require that the party start approx. 7 AM on the 31st...)
	We expect other nexus-locations to be wired into the net along
with us, although the connectivity at the other locations will
probably be minimal. For all I know they might not be wired at all,
leaving us with only our own new years to celebrate. In any case, I
expect to have approximately 7 terminals which people can use to
communicate with the other cities. (Then again, for all I know that
might not happen.. We might not even have -1-... Ah the flux of life.)
	Bring someone to share. (You should also bring some-things- to
share too, like drinks, snacks, etc.)

	Please RSVP for directions. (Mail sameer@c2.org.. I'd like to
get an idea of how many people to expect, etc..)

Thanks.
