Here is one possible explanation:
As their beta test agreement states, the beta software is not licensed for
use in the US. Some legal thing that I don't understand. A few US users are
part of the beta test, probably because they kept bothering the guy who
hands out the beta UID's early in the morning before he had his coffee.

I know that the people on this list have been advocating ecash long before
a sinlge line of code was written and that we all deserve an early try of
the software. I am forwarding this to some of the folks at DigiCash,
perhaps we can convince them to broaden the beta.
