John Markoff writes today on an interview with Michael 
Spindler, chairman of Apple.  Here're some tidbits:

"And flirting with heresy, Mr. Spindler says he sees no need 
for the so-called information superhighway.  And 500 channels?  
Sixty are plenty.  'This is not going to be an all-electronic 
world where we all sit on a couch and are force-fed a constant 
stream of information,' said Mr. Sindler."

"Mr. Spindler took pains to contrast himself with two of his 
industry's rivals -- and vaunted visionaries -- William H. 
Gates, chairman of Microsoft, and Andrew S. Grove, chairman of 
Intel.  'They believe that just because of technospeak it's 
going to happen, but it's not,' said Mr. Spindler."

"And yet, Mr. Spindler, even as he decries the industry's 
preoccupation with the so-called vision thing, acknowledges 
that there are still ways of improving the life of the computer 
user.  'We still have to switch our computers on and off,' he 
said.  'We go to the restroom, and when we leave it flushes 
automatically.' "

And, on Mr. Schindler's daring mis-speak, note others today 
parlaying technospeak and adverting profitably in The Times 
just like the Forbidden Fruit:

"I.B.M. to Replace Pentium Chips in Some Machines" [Company 
News]

"Takeover Talk Pushes Lotus Shares Up", by Glenn Rifkin.

"A Challenge to Microsoft in Interactive TV", by Lawrence 
Fisher.

"Prodigy Testing Link to World Wide Web", by Peter Lewis.

"I.B.M. Makes Board Change".
