>NetCheque(TM) is an electronic payment system for the Internet

>Southern California.  Users registered with NetCheque accounting
>servers are able to write checks to other users.  When deposited, the

>NetCheque uses Kerberos to protect electronic checks.

>A binary NetCheque release is available for Sun4 systems running SunOS.
>A source release, and binary releases for other architectures will be

>To write checks or deposit checks you will require a a NetCheque

>Though we can grant NetCheque accounts to anyone that requests one,
>because the software uses encryption to protect the checks we regret
