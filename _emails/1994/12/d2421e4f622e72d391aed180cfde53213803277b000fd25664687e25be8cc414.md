I have a script generating covering traffic. It creates a message at random
intervals between 1 and 20 min. The messages are encrypted, and padded with
cutmarks for all remailers which support that. The messages are sent
through six hops. The remailers are chosen from all reasonably reliable
remailers on Raph Levine's list (except for those which have asked to be
excluded).
