This idea was buried in the "Rae" thread and I thought it deserved a life
of its own.

As we have found out, the freenets use an interface called "FREEPORT." To
myself and many others this software is a mystery. I am wondering if it is
possible to call procmail via a .forward file under Freeport. If this is
possible, why couldn't someone write a .procmailrc file to sanitize the
headers. If this was written properly, all you should have to do is drop
procmail, the .procmailrc file and the .forward file in place and the
remailer is up and running.

The key here is will freeport call procmail through a .forward file (or
some reasonable facsimile.) The downside is I only have one account which I
am able to run procmail on. This account is presently acting as a
forwarding mechanism for pgp-public-keys@c2.org and my auto-responder.
Because of this I can't write and debug the recipe.

Happy Holidays,

Sam
