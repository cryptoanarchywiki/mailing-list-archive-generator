setting up an anon remailer

To those who might know the answer....

I'm running a power mac here, and I have an ethernet port and my own IP
address. To do email, I telnet to my University's unix system.

I was thinking, this sort of arrangement might allow me to set up an anon
remailer. Does anyone know if I can do this? If the technology is available?

If there is a way to do this from a macintosh, I'd like to give it a try.
Of course, I would ask the sys admins if necessary for permission. (i.e.,
if it can come straight to my IP address then it isn't necessary I assume).

Thanks

Tom
