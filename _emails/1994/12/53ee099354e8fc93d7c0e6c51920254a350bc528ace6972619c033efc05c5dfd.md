You would want to sign your new key with your old key wouldn't you? Anyone 
can add a signature to your old key, but only you can add your (old key's) 
signature to a new key. I agree that signing your old key with your new key 
is probably a good idea, as it shows that the owners of the key (the same 
person) trust that the keys belong to who they say they are.
