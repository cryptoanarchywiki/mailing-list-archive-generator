No.  I could see the argument that PGP is bringing crypto to the masses.  I
can't see it bring crypto-awareness to the masses.  In order to find and use
PGP, you have to already be concern about privacy and cryptography.

Netscape, on the other hand, by popping up the alert that this traffic isn't
being encrypted, and may be evesdropped, is and will get the common folk to
think about data security and confidentiality.  A lot more people will probably
use Netscape than PGP, and the people who use Netscape are the people to whom
the wonders of encryption need to be shown.

As to whether Netscape's crypto is good or bad, I'll leave that to the
chest-pounding "IETF is life.  IPSP should be all you need to be happy" folk. 
Personally, I'd prefer a standards based scheme, and it looks like the NCC folk
are looking that way, despited the unwarranted abuse they are getting.

They've said they are investigating it.  They are here, and they are listening,
and looking into it.  What do you want of them?
