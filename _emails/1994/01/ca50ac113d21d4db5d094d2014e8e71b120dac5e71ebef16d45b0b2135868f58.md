Thanks for the note, L.Detweiler!

Let's see, I added a bunch of files to the gopher site, and I'll do
more maintenance next weekend.

I sent out remailing requests, and got responses from these remailers:

Remailed-By: Remailer <catalyst-remailer@netcom.com>
X-Remailed-By: Anonymous <remailer-admin@chaos.bsu.edu>
X-Remailed-By: Anonymous <nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu>
From: nobody@cicada.berkeley.edu
From: nobody@shell.portal.com
Remailed-By: remailer03 <elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu>
From: nobody@rosebud.ee.uh.edu ---> elee6ue, which returned an
                                    insufficent funds message
From: nobody@shell.portal.com  ---> I surmise Hal is forwarding his
                                    alumni account to portal

The following errors were received:

"|/u50/sameer/.myfilt"  (unrecoverable error)
    (expanded from: <sameer@netcom.com>)

550 <remail@tamaix.tamu.edu>... User unknown

So that's hearing from 18 out of 21, and maybe some more will drift in
shortly :-)  I'll test again in a while.

Yes, this is what the remailer at menudo does, all incoming mail is
just filed away, and then remailed at midnight.  I beleive I changed
the mailout script to pause for 5 or 10 seconds in between mailing.
Hopefully this will guard against massive onslaught attacks.
