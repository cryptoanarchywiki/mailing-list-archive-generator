I am willing to dedicate this Netcom account to be a remailer. Please send me the
needed script, information, and personal comments. I want a fast and sturdy
remailer routine. At least tell me where to ftp the best and latest script,
and exactly how to install it and how to maintain it. Oh, I also want it to
handle encrypted remailing! I'll need PGP too. I've seen PGP for Unix and it looked
intimidating to install.

INFO NEEDED.
