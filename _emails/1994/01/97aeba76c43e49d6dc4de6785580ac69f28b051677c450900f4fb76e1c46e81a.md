As to why you might want to check against a list, consider it private and
a priviledge to participate in.  Another example, 'punksters decide to work
collaboratively on a project and want to restrict the exposure/discussion to
trusted list members to protect the project from outside influence/intervention,
Bottom line, don't you want to know that the person you think you are respondingto today is the same person you were communicating last week etc?  Don't you
want to keep someone from pretending to be you and sending out opinions etc.
which might damage your reputation or misrepresent you?  This is NOT censorship
i.e. it does NOT stop you from expressing your views, it only ensures that a
message which appears to be from you really IS from you.
