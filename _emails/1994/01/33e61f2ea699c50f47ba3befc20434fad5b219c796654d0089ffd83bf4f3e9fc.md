I forward this from Usenet. Seems drugs are the latest excuse to scare people
into the need to trample the Bill of Rights and Constitution.

NBC is asking the question, "Will Legalization End The Violence?"

They have a phone number to call if you think the answer is "YES". The
call will cost you 55cents. The number is:

                1-900-230-6221

You can also fax them any comments you have about the
legalization/violence issue. I faxed them a 3 page letter. The fax number is:

                1-212-664-5818

You can E-Mail them any comments at the following address:

                violence@NBC.GE.COM

You can also call and leave them a Voice Mail comment. They have a 3
minute limit on this Voice Mail call and it costs 95 cents a minute. The
number is:

                1-900-678-6221

They said the phone lines would be open most of the day (whatever that
means). Today is Monday, January 24, 1994.

Finally a USE for all those extra identities, voting twice ;-).
