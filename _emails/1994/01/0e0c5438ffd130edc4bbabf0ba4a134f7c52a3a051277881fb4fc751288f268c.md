Are there really no countries in the world that would permit such a  
server?  How depressing.

If true, I guess the next question becomes:  How can you offer a service  
to the Internet, but make it impossible for a Bad Guy to physically locate  
you?

Perhaps the server shouldn't stay in any one location for very long.   
Bring it up and post an Internet address.  Operate for a few days, then  
shut it down and move to some new location, with a new Internet address.  

Sounds possible, but damned inconvenient.  A wireless connection would  
help.  The server host could be in a van or RV or something.  <sigh>
