  Dear Nick:
  Thanks for the reasoned, even-tempered, and well-researched reply. As a 
named tentacle in the SQUISH spectacular, and as a modestly frequent 
contributer to the anonymity versus responsibility threads, I believe I 
can qualify as one who has done his homework. Detweiler is not in my kill 
file -- nor are you. But as for your unsolicited 132K forward of sundry 
spams, I am depositing it where, in my considered judgement, it belongs.

                                 ______ 
                                 \     \.
