Something to consider for this is Safe-Tcl and the proposed Enabled-Mail
extension for MIME.  Enabled-Mail will allow you to create a multi-part
MIME message that contains a script to be executed in a safe interpreter at
delivery-time (to the user's mailbox) or at read-time; one proposed use
listed in the draft was to generate return-reciepts when mail had been
delivered to the recipient.  It would be quite trivial to adapt this system
to send off an encapsulated message back through the remailers that would
take a random path through the system and at the final remailer ask to be
delivered to /dev/null.

If/when enabled-mail is accepted as a part of the MIME standard it will
become fairly transparent to the user and can be spread to more than just
Unix hosts.

It would be trivial to have the remailer randomize the paths generated in
the scripts it attaches to messages going out.

Again, this could be done by the script-generation process so that all
error messages are pointed to the remailer.
