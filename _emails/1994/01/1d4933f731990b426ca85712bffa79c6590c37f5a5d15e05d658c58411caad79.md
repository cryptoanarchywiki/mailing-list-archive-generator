I don't think you necessarily need this agreement.

First off, I think you don't understand fair use -- it is not a right the
author grants, EVERYONE has the right to fair-use of ANY copyrighted
document. For instance, the Supreme Court recently said that recording
material off cable for personal use only was fair-use--giving it to another
was not.

Secondly, I think there is an implied contract between you and the person
that provides the content that you will make it available to others--they
would not have any reason to give it to you otherwise. If others that you
pass it to abuse it by going beyond fair-use, that is not your liability,
but is theirs.

I'm not an attorney, but you may want to find someone on the net that is.
Try the cni-copyright@cni.org list, or misc.legal newsgroup.
