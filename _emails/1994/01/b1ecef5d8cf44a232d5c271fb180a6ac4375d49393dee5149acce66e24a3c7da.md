Um, I was referring to _initiation_ of force.  When the government taxes
you that is initiation of force.  When you fire a gun at a robber (or an
IRS agent attempting to steal your assets) that is self-defense.

But what is the philosophical premise behind government as it now stands?
I believe it is altruism - the ethics that tells man that action in his
own rational self-interest is immoral ("selfish") and that only self-
sacrifice, acting _against_ one's own interest for the benefit of the
people, one's neighbors, the state, or some random homeless person, is
morally good.

The ethical bases of laissez-fare capitalism is rational egoism, not
altruism.  According to altruism, productivity for one's own benefit
is a vice, suffering is a virtue.  This is why the "free market" isn't
free - it is ethically incompatible with the philosophical basis of
our so-called leaders (and many, many citizens.)

As long as we do not reject the moral code of altruism we will move
steadily towards fascism - the parallels between the Weimar developments
and those here in the United States are rather astonishing - I'll be
happy to elaborate on them if there is interest.
