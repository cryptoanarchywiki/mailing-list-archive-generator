	 An appeals court has just held that Press Shield laws apply to
	 those writing books.  Since anything can be research for a
	 book, those of us who have written books may have protection
	 for all our "notes."  Likewise those who have written
	 freelance magazine articles.  Better to use encryption for
	 your notes though.

One caveat -- I believe that the shield laws are state laws; the
U.S. Supreme Court has *not* upheld the principle.  Check with your
local lawyers first.
