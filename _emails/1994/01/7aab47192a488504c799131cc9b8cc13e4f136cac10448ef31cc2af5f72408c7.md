I hate to intrude here but I have been seeing all the smoke out in
the newsgroups about this "tentacle" business and L. Detweiler (who
is this guy??!). I hope I won't be flamed so I am sending this
through a remailer. (I love your technology, one of my friends
went to a cypherpunk meeting once and told me about the cooler
stuff.) I sent L. Detweiler some of these questions but he 
never responded, so I was hoping people here could help me
understand what is going on out here!!!

So anyway...

Could someone define "tentacle"?

Detweiler said, out in the newsgroups:

>

> to pretend he was real. M.Dale sent me mail claiming he was real. I

I don't agree with that in the least. (With what he says they did, not
the paragraph itself).

I have followed this thread for such a short time (relativly speaking).
I think I picked up on the "Cryptoanarchist" part (someone who doesn't
support the regulation of cryptography?). From what I've been able to
gather, the talk is about "tentacles" coming from one "Medusa."

So many makeshift terms here that I'm not familiar with. Could 
someone Define "cypherpunk." (I HAVE heard of "CyberPunk," but 
couldn't extract a meaning out of that either.) Please enlighten me.

What trash is this? The only thing I have seen (so far, as I believe)
are various messages written by an12070 (L. Detweiler?) that have erupted into
flame wars. 

Keep in mind that I'm NOT FLAMING ANYONE here.

CyberAnarchists... Is that someone who doesn't want CyberSpace
regulated? Personally, I have nothing against the free exchange of
information (does anyone here?).

I was really upset when he said

> death to cyberanarchists-- by anarchy...
>

is this one of the "violent death threats" that everyone has been
talking about?

thanks for the help, I just want to know. sorry that I missed 
some of the earlier stuff. I will be watching this list for
a reply.

BTW that stuff that Detweiler is doing with signatures, switching
them around, it is kind of ironic given that the cypherpunks are
really into that thing. He seems to be really pissing you guys off.
but I gotta admit it really is a sort of new art form in cyberspace,
kinda like Graffiti. although, there is so much activity lately 
that it kind of makes me wonder if there is a whole team of people
out there. there have been a lot of rumors about infiltrators and
double agents. we'll see what the future brings. 

personally I think remailers are God's Gift to Cyberspace, and 
anything done to limit their capabilities or infringe on the 
privacy of whoever uses them is CENSORSHIP and ORWELLIAN POLICE 
STATE. we'll prove to Detweiler that we are not the hypocrites
he claims we are, that under no circumstances whatsoever will
we *ever* betray the people who use our remailers, even if they
are our enemies, because Privacy is all that matters.
