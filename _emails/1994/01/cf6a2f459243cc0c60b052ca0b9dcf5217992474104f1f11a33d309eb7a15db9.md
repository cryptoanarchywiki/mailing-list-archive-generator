         Electronic Frontier Foundation - Austin (EFF-Austin)
          EFF-Austin was formed to protect constitutional guarantees of free
          speech and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure for
          users of computer networks. Experience has taught us that these
          freedoms must be fought for if they are to survive in the online
          world.  EFF-Austin was created as an experimental local chapter of
          the national EFF but became independent in 1993 while retaining
          contacts with the parent organization. We're heavily involved
          in public speaking, education, and advocacy of constitutional
          rights in cyberspace. We're Austin's forum for discussion of all
          concerns related to the cutting edge where society meets technology.

           TheseGroups is a mailing list expressly for and about groups,
           individuals and organizations like those listed here, wherein
           ideas and experiences can be exchanged, leading to better
           inter-communication and cross-pollenization.  This is not
           a conference for lurkers or chatterers, but for those that
           really want to get some work done, and who wish to make a
           difference.

          CYPHERPUNKS
           The Cypherpunks mailing lists exist for those interested in
           cryptography and it's political rammifications, programming
           encryption software, creation of digital cash and electronic
           banking via secure (and anonymous) crypto tech, local crypto-
           oriented activism, hacking cypher hardware, and more.  There
           also tends to be much libertarian/anarcho-capitalist
           debate as well.  The main list is VERY high-traffic.  The
           UK branch generally goes by the name of UK Crypto-Privacy Assoc.
           The CypherWonks list is a split-off that is generally opposed to
           the anarchic stance of some on the main list.  There are also
           some local lists [no info on these as of yet.]

          comp.org.eff.talk/comp.org.eff.news
           These newsgroups (online conferences), also gated to Internet
           mailing lists and Fidonet echomail conferences, serve as much
           more that EFF house organs, and are "hot spots" for online debate
           on issues such as civil liberties online, legal liabilities of
           system operators, copyright and net distribution, the development
           of a national public network, and more.  Some other groups that
           may be relevant to such interests:

          alt.activism.d
          alt.2600
