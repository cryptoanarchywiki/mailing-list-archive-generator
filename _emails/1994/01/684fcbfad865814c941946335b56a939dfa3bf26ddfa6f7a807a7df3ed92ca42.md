I must say that I attempted to subscribe in december and didn't start
receiving mail until the second week in january. At that time Eric
explained to the list that he had been away for some time.

By that time I had subscribed from another address, and suddenly found
myself reading the list from two accounts. It had been so long since I
subscribed that I had forgotten the cypherpunks-request bit, and just
remembered that it was some 'toad' thing. When I saw someone had sent a
cancel request to cypherpunks@toad.com, I assumed that was correct.

My own attempt to unsubscribe from the extra account resulted immediately
in 3 mail messages, two of which were somewhat abusive. One person seemed
to be under the impression that this is a usenet group, and therefore I
shouldn't send unsubscribe messages to it, since only mailing lists
are for subscribing/unsubscribing.

The next day, Eric sent me mail with the right address for unsubscribe
requests.
