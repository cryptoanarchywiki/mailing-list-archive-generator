Mr. Detweiler, I would claim that you have the brain of a cabbage, but
obviously you've expended a fair quntity of intellect figuring out this
tremendous conspiracy of cryptoanarchists and their devious leaders
attempting to sink you (if they're anarchists, how can they have leaders
anyhow?)

Dozens of people have stated that they have met all the people you
think are the same. You are living in a self-consistant delusion --
there is no way to demonstrate to your satisfaction that your claims
are false, because you won't accept testimonial evidence and you wont
go through any effort to check out the evidence you have been given
that you can check out yourself. There is no amount of effort that
will convince you of the truth. Meanwhile, you continue to post huge
disruptive messages about topics 99% of the net doesn't care about
both under your name and under "an12070@anon.penet.fi" to dozens of
newsgroups. I'd say if anyone around here is a problem its YOU.

Nick Szabo is a real human being, last I checked.   He was a computer
science major at U.W. and later worked at JPL in Pasadena.  He shared a
basement apartment with a Tibetan holy man.  While he was about as odd
as any other hardcore C-Sci guy I know of, he's a lousy candidate to be
a leader, a tentacle, or any other part of a massive cryptoanarchist
conspiracy.

This won't dissuade you (obviously, I'm just another member of the
conspiracy.  My tenous link with Nick proves it for a fact.  In fact,
Jeremy Anderson is just an alias!  I picked up the driver's license,
credit cards, passport, and personality dossier 8 years ago in Tiajuana
from a shadowy man known only as "rodriguez, with two lower case r's".)
Let's try a different tact.

Yes Detweiler.  You have sucessfully exposed the international
cryptoanarchist conspiracy.  Unfortunately, our vast experience with
media manipulation and our connections with the highest levels of
government will hamper your ability to make further progress.  We are
proud to count as members of our conspiracy such luminaries as Socks
Clinton, Bobby Inman, Connie Chung Yu-Hwa (who while mascarading as a
mild-mannered TV anchor is our connection with the Chinese Kuomintang's
massive intelligence apparatus), and the 23 secret leaders of the
Masons.  We've been monitoring your actions for years with bugs,
wiretaps, and secret agents.  One night, while you slept, a crack
surgical terrorist team entered your domicile, sedated you heavily, and
planted radio-controlled electrodes in your head.  Should you ever get a
positive identification on any of the leaders of our cabal, a radio
signal will be sent causing you to go into a massive seizure, whereupon
the elctrodes will disintegrate, leaving no trace of our work for the
forensics experts to sift through.

The situation really is hopless Detweiler.  We can wipe your existence
off the face of the planet any time.  While we figure you're too driven
and fanatical to co-opt, we're happy to fight to a draw.

Congratulate yourself.  Your superior intellect has exposed more about
the inner workings of our organization (and I use the term loosely) than
we expected any mere mortal to be able to manage.  We consider our
protection mechanisms to be strong enough that you won't be able to
cause much damage to our command and control structure.  Relax, take the
day to go hiking in the mountains, enjoy life, and know that your
personal desires and plans are safe from interference for now.

Regards,

Jeremy Anderson

Assistant Secretary of Propaganda
United Thought Patrol
