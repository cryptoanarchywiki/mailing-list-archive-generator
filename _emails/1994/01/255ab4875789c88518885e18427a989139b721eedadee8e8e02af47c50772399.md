Not sure what this has to do with List anymore, what with Inman
slinking away (he pulled a perot), but here goes:

"Anonymous" writes:

Not Bamford, but likely a very new book on how the U.S. helped arm
Iraq. I forget the title, but it's very new. I flipped through it, and
in fact looked up the references to Inman, as I'd heard the book raked
him over the coals.

Well, I'm not Gilmore, except as a Tentacle, but Dell was not the
company involved. Any of the written articles about Inman should do a
good job of naming these connections, how Inman wrote some letters, etc.

Inman is history, in any case.
