I just got (what I think is) the alt.security.pgp faq.
I quote:
    ...the IDEA encryption algorithm used in PGP is actually
    MUCH stronger than RSA given the same key length.  Even with a 1024 bit
    RSA key, it is believed that IDEA encryption is still stronger, and,
    since a chain is no stronger than it's weakest link, it is believed that
    RSA is actually the weakest part of the RSA - IDEA approach.
Confirmation?
