It is a statement of fact, but it is also an incorrect statement of
fact. One would go so far as to say deliberate lie or rewriting of
history, but I have no evidence for that. The courts HAVE supported
the interpretation of the "gun lobby", and repeatedly. The problem is
that no case has come before the court since U.S. vs. Miller in
1939. Indeed, it appears that the court is deliberately avoiding the
issue, much as they deliberately refused flag burning cases for over
25 years. In the Miller case, the court specifically held that the
second amendment applied to individual ownership of military weapons,
and found against Miller only on the narrow grounds that no evidence
had been provided to the court demonstrating whether a shotgun was a
military weapon. (Miller's attorneys did not appear before the court,
and thus their side did not present evidence.)
