Actually, that statement is quite false. I highly recommend that everyone
interested in this topic read Terry Carroll's excellent Copyright FAQ,
available for anonymous FTP from rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.209],
in directory /pub/usenet/news.answers/law/Copyright-FAQ, files part1 -
part6.

Howevever, just because any posting you made after 1988 is automatically
copyrighted by you does not mean that you still can't put it on your CD:

There is quite a bit of discussion on this topic in misc.legal newsgroup,
as well as in the lists faq-maintainers@mit.edu and cni-copyright@cni.org.
