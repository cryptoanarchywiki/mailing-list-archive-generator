Here's a nice double-meaning phrase for certain times:
        "Too Many Rats"
1) Without crypto, you have too much contact with your neighbors,
   like the rats in those overcrowding experiments.
2) There are too many people who will take personal information
   about you and pass it on to curious strangers.

Example of use:

Alice: "I was having a conversation with a friend of mine and realized 
that my encryption script was broken and it was going out in plaintext!"

Bob: (shivers) "Brr, too many rats!"

cryptocosmology- sufficiently advanced communication is indistinguishable
