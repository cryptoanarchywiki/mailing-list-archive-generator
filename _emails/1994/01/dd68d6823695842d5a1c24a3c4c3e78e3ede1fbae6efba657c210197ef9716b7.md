    (Technically, cryptography is MAKING codes while cryptanalysis is 
    BREAKING them.  Both are subsumed under cryptology.  A CIPHER is 
    a regular transposition such as A=Z, B=Y, etc., while a CODE is a 
    table of arbitrary symbols.)
    Kahn, David, THE CODEBREAKERS, MacMillan, 1967.  The MOST 
      complete history with specific examples.  Written before public 
      keys, RSA, etc., but still THE place to start.

      history and post-1967 developments. 
    Sinkov, Abraham, ELEMENTARY CRYPTANALYSIS: A MATHEMATICAL 
      APPROACH, Random House, 1968.  Sinkov worked for Friedman on the 
      breaking of Purple.  First rate. 
    Gaines, Helen Fouche, CRYPTANALYSIS, Dover, 1956. A classic 
      work.  The first step to breaking codes and ciphers. 
    Lysing, Henry, SECRET WRITING, Dover, 1974.  Another reprint of 
      another classic.

      Textbook for mathematicians from IBM's Watson Center. Includes 
      public keys, digital signatures.

      1982. From IBM Cryptography Competency Center.  For computers,
      includes public keys, digital signatures. 
    Weber, Ralph E., UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC CODES AND CIPHERS 1775-
      1938, Precedent, 1979.  Not just a history!  The appendix 
      contains the all the keys!! 
    Chadwick, THE DECIPHERMENT OF LINEAR B, Vintage, 1958. Worked with 
      Michael Ventris on unraveling Minoan script.
    Yardley, Herbert O., THE AMERICAN BLACK CHAMBER, Ballantine 1981, 
    Random House, 1931.  Yardley broke German ciphers in WWI and then 
    Japanese ciphers of 1920, and was fired in 1931 because "Gentlemen 
    don't read each other's mail."
