I like this idea.  It seems to use fewer CPU resources than having a  
remailer route a bogus message through a random set of other remailers and  
back to itself.

If I understand the encrypted remailer scheme correctly, the "route  
through random set" mechanism requires a remailer to enclose a bogus  
message in a set of nested digital envelopes (one for each remailer in the  
random remailer set).  The "round-robin send to peers" mechanism only  
requires the remailer to create one envelope per bogus message.

I also like the idea because it seems easier to analyse, and therefore  
easier to describe/formalize the properties of the system as a whole.
