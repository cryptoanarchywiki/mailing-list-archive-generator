Updated Ordering Information:

Due to popular demand, we will be accepting checks for orders on a few 
conditions: The checks must be drawn on US banks for orders placed in the 
US ONLY. We cannot accept checks from outside the US. Orders placed from 
outside the US should be paid using a Money Order, or Cashier's Check in 
US Funds.

Also, please include your e-mail address with your order, so we can 
acknowledge receiving it. 

The original announcement is below. Thanks!

"Cypherpunk Criminal" T-shirt Ordering Information
---------------------------------------------------------

Part I: Where to get a preview of the design

The front of the t-shirt can be obtained via anonymous FTP at netcom.com in
pub/cvoid/cypherpunks. The filename is "front.gif" which is based on Jef
Poskanzer's "CRYPTO-DATA" DOT warning logo (this file is available as well
as "logo.gif"). The back of the t-shirt consists of the upper banner,
"cypherpunks@toad.com", and the lower banner, "There is safety in large
numbers". In the middle is a listing of 7-digit primes in a large block. The
typestyle is Fusion and Fusion bold. Outputting this to a GIF is next to
impossible due to the resolution needed to reproduce the text. Trust us,
it's cool.

Part II: What kind of t-shirt is it? What color? Sizes? Custom? Availability?

The t-shirts are Hanes Beefy-T's, which are a very strong and durable. The
t-shirts will be black, with white and yellow screened on to it. We were
unable to come up with a practical way to customize the t-shirts on an
individual or group basis, so we opted for this design instead. We will
only be making as many as we get orders for, and have no plans to do a second
printing. Sizes available are S, M, L, and XL. We may be able to get XXL, XXXL
and XS shirts as well. We will post an update in regards to the additional
sizes. 

Part III: How much do they cost? Ordering deadline?

The t-shirts will cost $10 each, which will include shipping and handling to
anywhere you want them sent (except Mars). We will be accepting orders until
February 15th. The t-shirts will be shipped out before February 28th.

Part IV: Ordering Information

Please make all Money Orders out to "Inky Fingers" (the screening company we
use). Please specify the number of t-shirts, and what size you need, and 
where you want them shipped. We cannot (for obvious reasons) accept 
personal checks. Cashier's Checks and Money Orders only, please. Orders 
can be mailed to:

                V/M/R
                Attn: Cypherpunks T-Shirt
                P.O. Box 170213
                San Francisco, CA 94117-0213

If you have any further questions, you can send me e-mail here at
<cvoid@netcom.com> or <cvoid@albemuth.tatertot.com>. Anyone who sent e-mail
in regards to this will also get this e-mailed to them directly, in case they
do not have access to the list.

Feel free to forward this to any interested parties. Thanks.
