Note that pizzabox.demon.co.uk [158.152.8.236] doesn't tell where it got
the message from.  Could it have been longs.lance.colostate.edu?  I
liked Detweiler better when he just used anon.penet.fi.


P.S. I sent myself a test email by telnetting to pizzabox.demon.co.uk
25, but it identified the IP address I telnetted from... hopefully the
site administrators at demon.co.uk have recognized the problem and taken
steps to prevent further detweiling.  But be on your lookout, this will
only hold him off until he can find another SMTP port to spoof from.
