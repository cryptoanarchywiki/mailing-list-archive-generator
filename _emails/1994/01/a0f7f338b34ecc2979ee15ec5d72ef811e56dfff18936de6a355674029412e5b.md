So if I sell (at a profit) a netnews feed to subscribers via modem, it
is not copyright infringement, but if I sell the same data on a CDROM,
you cliam copyright infringement.  So I suppose you want to give some
kind of list of what types of media are acceptable for transmitting
netnews feeds, and which are not?  And I suppose that the Federal
Copyright Beaureau will then need to enforce a new law to make sure that
netnews is distributed only via government-approved methods.  Ahh.. I
can smell the new gummint conspiracy already.

The plain and simple fact is: When you post a message to usenet, you do
so with the expectation that others will receive it.  You can have no
way of knowing or limiting who may get it; that is given by the nature
of the network.  Usenet news is, and is intended to be, publicly
accessable information.  If there is something you don't want
distributed, then DON'T POST IT!
