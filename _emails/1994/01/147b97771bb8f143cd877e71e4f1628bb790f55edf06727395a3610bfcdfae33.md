I bought a Sound Blaster Clone card a couple of days ago for $65,
including a nice integrated stereo headset and hands-free microphone.

The Brand name is "Sound Sparc Mecer Multimedia Sound System".
It claims to be compatible with Sound Blaster V2.0.

I purchased it at the Campbell Domino Computer store; probably other
members of the chain also have it.

The reason I mention it here is that this unit might work well along
with a 9600bps or higher modem & appropriate software (to be
developed) to implement an encrypted phone system for real-time
(or close) voice.

Anyone working on a similar project please contact me via E-mail
so we can compare notes.
