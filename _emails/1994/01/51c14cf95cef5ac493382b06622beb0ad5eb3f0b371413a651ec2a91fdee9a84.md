I think csn.org must have been down for a few minutes when you first tried.
In any case, Curve Encrypt 1.0 is now posted at csn.org.  Read
/mpj/README.MPJ for export restrictions and the name of the hidden directory
(that changes periodically).  Curve encrypt is in csn.org:
/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/curve_encrypt
 
>Curve Encrypt is a freeware drag-and-drop encryption application for the

>phrase, and encrypts both the data and resource forks of files. Source code
