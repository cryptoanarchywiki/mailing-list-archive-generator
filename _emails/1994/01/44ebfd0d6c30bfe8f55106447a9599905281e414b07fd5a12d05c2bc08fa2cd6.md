        I just recently got MacRipem and find it much easier to use than PGP,
        and was wondering why I should use PGP over Ripem.  The above seems to
        indicate that Ripem isn't as secure.  Why is this?

I don't doubt that its much easier to use -- it was written by Ray
Lau, who is an excellent Mac/UI programmer.  The most reasonable
reasons why it might be called "less secure" is that RIPEM does not
have a signature web like PGP does.  It is possible in PEM to only
have one signature on your certificate, which can be your own
signature, or that of a CA.  Therefore, you either have the status of
"I say I am who I say I am", or a "Certification Authority says I am
who I say I am".

I hope this answeres your question.
