This has been an idea of sorts that I have been tossing around to Doug down
here over bagels and coffee; how to decouple the server from any single
physical host or subset of hosts in a cooperating pool.  There is some
interesting work in secure multi-party computation protocols that might be
coupled with a distributed MUD-like server to create a system that can act
as an information server or broker without needing a specific physical
location.   

It would take some hacking to get things to work together, but it might be
possible to create a network of servers that listen for RPCish requests
from various other members of the network and together they might provide
enough ambiguity regarding where the actual server resides.  It would take
some work, but it should be possible...
