Those "complete loonies" include Thomas Jefferson and many other of
the founding fathers.

...a conflict in which the opposing sides were geographically separate,
making it easy to know where to aim an attack.  The situation is much
more difficult when the enemy is hidden among you.  Apparently, you've
never heard of the Revolutionary War, the Vietnam War or the
Afghanistan War.

My, my, more name-throwing.  You know, it never ceases to amaze me how
selective some people can be in the rights they support (and for
whom).  It always comes back to bite them eventually, though.  The
South might have successfully seceded if it hadn't been for their
nasty habit of keeping slaves.  Conservatives who supported property
rights but not certain personal rights now find that no-one's property
is safe under the civil forfeiture laws, which were passed to fight
the War on (Some) Drugs.  And those who support the right to use
cryptography, but not the right to bear arms, will find that the same
argument used against gun owners -- "X is a favored tool of criminals,
thus we must ban X" -- will be turned against users of cryptography.

You'd better learn to get along with gun owners, Phil.  You just might
end up sharing a prison cell with one.
