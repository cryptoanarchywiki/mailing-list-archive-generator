There is a major difference.  At any given Mensa RG, there is the group 
playing trivial pursuit, and there is the other group...  "Hell's 
Mensans" are notorious for "livening" up events.  Of course we are also 
the ones responsible for the O'Hare Ramada getting cold to our parties.  
I wonder if they ever straightened out their pay-per-view cable problems...
