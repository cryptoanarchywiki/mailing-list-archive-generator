me too, Medusa.

what about the fact that the same stuff can appear in many places? with
virtually no additional effort! what about `fallout' of clueless
newbies responding to idiotic posts? in places you don't even know about?

an interesting thing about SQUISH-- whoever did it probably has
suffered no serious consequences, if the remailers are actually secure,
and it would be possible to do the whole thing over again next weekend
without any negative consequences on their part.
