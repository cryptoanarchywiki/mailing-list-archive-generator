Politics also involves some of that, but it wasn't what I was refering
to. 

The answer to the question is the garment industry. Huge underground
factories and design shops operate on a completely cash
basis. Millions of dollars of goods enter in to the system
"mysteriously". There are "sweatshops" (read, free market factories)
operating all over the city in concealed locations.  They are almost
always operated by the Chinese -- they have a code of silence about
such things. Its one of the few things thats keeping the economy in
NYC going. This operates on a HUGE scale. Its a counterexample to
Hal's beliefs about industry and taxation.
