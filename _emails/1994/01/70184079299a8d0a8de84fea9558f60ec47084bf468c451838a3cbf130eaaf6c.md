README.DOC, a Pennsylvania-based computer book discounter, sells their
books at a 25% discount.  $2 for S&H, though if you buy 3 or more books at
a time they waive shipping charges as well.  They have Applied
Cryptography in stock.  800-678-1473. 

I also asked about Intro to Komolgorov Complexity; they don't stock it.
I forgot to ask about Koza's Genetic Programming.
