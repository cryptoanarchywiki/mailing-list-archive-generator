I don't believe this is overstating the case at all. To quote Gregory
Chaitin, from a context I cannot do justice here: "...leads to the
demonstration that a specific number cannot be proved random."
("Information, Randomness, and Incompleteness: Papers on Algortithmic
Information Theory," Second Edition, 1993)

To see this another way, suppose an algorithm existed to always know
if a given number is "random" or not. Then application of this
algorithm to the natural numbers would presumably find the "smallest
random number," such as "729." (An inside joke.) But this smallest
random number would itself be intensely interesting and hardly random.
And so on, a la the Berry Paradox and other well-know cousins of
Godel's Theorem.

If someone claims they can "prove" the sequence "0
1101100110111100010" is really random, ask them _how_. Ask them if the
compression "Chaitin 27," meaning the example number given on page 27
of Chaitin's book is not that same number, making it hardly random.

(Is it cheating to invoke other systems, books, etc. in the
definition? Hardly. Cryptographers do it all the time. The mass of
planet motion observation data certainly _looked_ random to ancient
astronomers, until Kepler found his amazing compression of the data.)

There is a mass of stuff here, and much room for us all getting
tangled up in what randomness really means, what algorithms are,
formal definitions (with reference to Turing machines and whether they
halt or not, etc.), and so on. I urge interested readers to read
Chaitin's papers, which are focused on issues of randomness, and also
the Li and Vitanyi book.

I stand by my point that no number or sequence can be proved to be random.
