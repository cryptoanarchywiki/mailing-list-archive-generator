Because of economics and political stability.

You can build computers and monitoring devices in secret, deploy them
in secret, and listen to _everything_.  To listen to everything with
bludgeons and pharmaceuticals would not only cost more in labor and
equipment, but also engender a radicalizing backlash to an actual
police state.

Of course, if one is paranoid, these considerations of the whole do
not hold, since for only one person the cost balance is reversed.

There is safety in numbers.
