Not all banks in the world are a part of FDIC. Who said that an internet
bank would have to be US based? Are there NO banks that you feel are
trustworthy outside of the US?

Many doctoral dissertations have been written on the Fed. Most of them
come to the conclusion that the Fed is an utter failure...

Two points:

1) A single bank would not have enough capital to significantly affect
world interest and inflation rates, even if all of its depositors acted
in concert to do so.

2) If you ignore that and assume that a new banking system grew outside
of government control with enough capital to affect the world markets,
why is that A Bad Thing?  Do you really think that a large non-us-government
regulated bank would bring the world financial system to its knees?
