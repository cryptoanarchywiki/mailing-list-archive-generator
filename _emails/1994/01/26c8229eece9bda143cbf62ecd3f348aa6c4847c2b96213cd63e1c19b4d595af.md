  I think the idea of a standard user configurable crypto-engine
is a good one..that way people could choose (and upgrade) algorythms..
sort of like modern DSP based highspeed modems..(It could also have a socket
for ROM based firmware cartridges..(RSA,IDEA,etc..) and a magstripe 
reader and keyboard for key entry..(This would make trading keys easy..)

I think this discussion was had 
before,about a year ago.. Would anyone care to elaborate on it?
-Chris.
