That was the answer I was lookin for. Any more maths available ? (formulas!,
formulas!) My paranoia hates the ``I believe'' part.

I did a brute force search too in my first example. However, this is the
story of the snake biting its tail:if you choose p and q with the ``nice''
properties you describe, you then restrict yourself to a subset of all
possible values of p and q, thus shrinking the key space search for the
possible attacker.
So, to completely answer the question, you need to figure out the
distribution of prime number couples (p,q) that verify:
	p=2p'+1,	p' prime
	q=2q'+1		q' prime, p'!=q'

This way you'll be able to know how much you're shrinking key space.
