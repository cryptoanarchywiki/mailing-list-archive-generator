CP's:  seems like this might be a chance to preach the PGP sermon and possibly
make $2500 - no doubt crypto tech is an issue here:

> Contest seeks essays on joint warfare
> 
>     ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Army News Service) -- If you can write about
> joint operations, you could win $2,500.
>     After four years of sponsoring the Warfighting Essay Contest,
> the U.S. Naval Institute, Annapolis, Md., is opening the contest to
> other services. Named for the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
> of Staff, the Colin L. Powell Joint Warfighting Essay Contest
> offers $2,500, $2,000 and $1,000 for the three best entries.
>     The competition seeks "those who are motivated to enter this
> contest not by a need to 'toe the policy line,' but who are devoted
> to the security of this great nation," Powell said.
>     All servicemembers and civilians are welcome to enter. They
> should write about combat readiness in a joint context --
> discussions of tactics, strategy, weaponry, combat training or
> other issues involving two or more services. 
>     Essays can feature one service in detail, but they must apply
> to joint force structure, doctrine, operations or organization for
> combat. They may discuss the interoperability of hardware and
> procedures, within the context of combat readiness.
>     Entries can be no longer than 3,000 words, and must be
> postmarked no later than April 1. Shorter opinion pieces or
> "professional notes" -- typically 2,000-word technical arguments --
> may also be competitive.
>     Following are the entry rules, as set by the U.S. Naval
> Institute --
> -- Essays must be original, not to exceed 3,000 words, and not have
> been previously published. An exact word count must appear on the
> title page.
> -- Mail entries to: Colin L. Powell Joint Warfighting Essay
> Contest; U.S. Naval Institute; 118 Maryland Ave.; Annapolis, Md.;
> 21402-5035.
> -- Entries must be postmarked on or before April 1.
> -- For fairness, entries will not be identified by the author's
> name -- the name must not appear on the essay. The author will give
> the essay a motto, in addition to a title. This motto will appear
> on the title page, with the title. It will also be written by
> itself on the outside of an accompanying sealed envelope. Enclosed
> will be the author's name, address, phone number, Social Security
> number, a short biography, essay title and motto. Envelopes will
> not be opened until the winners are chosen.
> -- Entrants must submit two complete copies of the essays,
> typewritten, double-spaced, on 8-1/2x11-inch paper. Authors who use
> computers are also asked to submit IBM-compatible disks and specify
> which word-processing software was used.
> -- The essays will be screened by a panel of officers from the five
> armed services. The panel will recommend six essays to the Naval
> Institute's Editorial Board, which will award the three cash
> prizes.
> -- The winners will be notified by phone in late May. Letters
> notifying all other entrants will be mailed by mid-June. Awards
> will be presented in July.
> -- The three top essays will be published in "Proceedings," the
> Naval Institute's magazine. Non-winning essays may also be
> published; their authors will be paid at the magazine's regular
> rate.
