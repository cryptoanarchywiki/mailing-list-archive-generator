Joi, NO. :-) I know there's been a Scientific American article on it within the  
past few years that might have more technically-detailed references. Naively,  
the idea is that any interference with the message can be detected because of  
the subtleties of QM measurement theory. It's theoretically possible but it's  
not something anybody'll be implementing anytime soon. Stick with PGP for now.  
See ya, Walter A. Kehowski <wak@next0.math.pitt.edu>
