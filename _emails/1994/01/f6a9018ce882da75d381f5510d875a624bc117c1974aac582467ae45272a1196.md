You've given me an idea.  I felt the edges of it when discussing my
plans for an endorsement message enhancement to Netnews/INN/Tin/...

Instead of controlling every message that gets posted, why don't we
instead allow email endorsements.  Each message has a unique message
id, is fairly easy to identify, and could of course be PGP signed.

What if we hacked a .procmailrc to 'mark' (Subject change?) or filter
messages that weren't marked properly (say they were signed but not by
the key you had for that person) OR those that received a later
endorsement (positive/neg/typing) from someone on your trusted list.

(ED: sorry for the long lines, I sometimes feel the thought is more
clear that way.)

Acting on an endorsement after you had received a message means
modifying a mailbox, which needs to be done carefully.  You might want
to track where the message went if using automatic sorting in
procmail.

What do you think?
