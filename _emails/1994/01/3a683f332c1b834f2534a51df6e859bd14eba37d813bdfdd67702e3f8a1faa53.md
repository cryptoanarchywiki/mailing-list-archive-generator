I have done a lot of optimization work on Mac and PC - Fractal 
generations & ray tracing both in C.
1.) Don't use SANE unless accuracy becomes a major issue. 
2.) CHANGE ALL FLOATS TO DOUBLE!!!! Better speed & better 
    accuracy!!!!! (MOST IMPORTANT due to Motorola design!)
3.) Think & MPW both can create FPU code as well '030 code. Use em.
4.) Fall back from system 7.x to newest 6.x with no multitasking.
    Then try to structure your object code size to fit in the cache of 
    680x0.    
5.) Use register variables where needed.
6.) Don't re-code in assembler - the gain usually isn't worth it.
7.) If there is alot of screen updating - stop it until the 
    final/desired result is achieved.
8.) Don't make System Task calls inside critical loops like Apple 
    says to do, it slows down completion time, it will invalidate your 
    code in the cache (see #4).
    There is alot more stuff but this should speed you up by a 
    significant factor.
9.) Mac's are wonderfull but for number crunching '486/66 can smoke 
    the mac due to 256k cache(secondary) and 8K cache (internal 
    -Primary). Don't know your budget but the POWER PC looks sweet. I 
    don't know when the compilers will opimize for this chip but look 
    for mega mega mega increase in performance.

Yup, but it's s...l...o....w.......
 
Hope this helps. Write back and let me know.
