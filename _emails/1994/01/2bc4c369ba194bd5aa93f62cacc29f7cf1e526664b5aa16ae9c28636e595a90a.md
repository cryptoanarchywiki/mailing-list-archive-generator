It may not actually be corrupted. I noticed that when I logged on manually
that the files were all compressed with gzip, an gnu zip-like compression
utility.

However, when I used Mosaic to download the files Mosaic showed them
without the gzip identifier, and downloaded them thinking they were
ordinary files. However, they were in fact compressed with gzip.

I suspect that they have some kind of software that spoofs some ftp clients
into giving ftp'ing an uncompressed version, but the spoofing does not work
with other ftp clients so you get gzip versions.
