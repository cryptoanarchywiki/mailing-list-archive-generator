The issue of bogus traffic between remailers is yet another parallel
to the Crying of Lot 49 :-)  Got to send at least one every week
to keep the system going..... On the other hand, some of those
mail folders are really named WASTE and not W.A.S.T.E., as I found out from
my ATTMAIL friendly user interface one day :-)

As far as telling real traffic from bogus traffic on remailers goes,
the implementation issues are much different between cleartext remailers
and remailers that accept encrypted mail.  The latter, if anybody's
written and implemented them, can easily handle bogus mail,
since eavesdroppers can't tell it form the real stuff.
It would be helpful if we agree on a standard format for 
mail that should be discarded by remailers, e.g.
	X-Anon-Discard: N
would either be discarded immediately or possibly be forwarder
to another destination with N replaced by N-1.
Alternatively, sending mail to some remailers without the
Anon-Remail-To: or equivalent header may cause it to be sent to a real person;
creating a standard "discard" user on some machines or having the 
remailer discard mail from the local MAILER-DAEMON equivalent
will allow anon-forwarding to bogususer on whatver machine.
