That constitutional backing is of questionable value - Rik Scarce (author
of the book "Ecowarriors") recently spent months in jail in Washington
State for refusing to reveal, to a federal grand jury, the whereabouts
of a person he interviewed for a book about animal rights activists. He
was released because a federal appellate court was convinced that holding
him longer wouldn't make him reveal the information sought.
