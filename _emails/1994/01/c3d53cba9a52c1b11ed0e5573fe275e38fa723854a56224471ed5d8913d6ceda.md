Yes anonymous IP would quickly get block by control freak sys admins.
Costs for internet connections vary, but plan to spend about 20K/year.
Plus about 10K in startup costs, plus equipment costs.  Depending on a lot
of factors prices can vary up to 50%.
Unless you are on the internet it is very hard to get connected.  Most of
the companies that sell internet access do business through email.
