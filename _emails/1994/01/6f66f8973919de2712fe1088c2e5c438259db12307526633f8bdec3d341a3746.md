I often see threads debating whether the courts have the right to compel  
you to reveal your encryption key.  Some say yes, some say no.

Under the assumption that courts *do* have the right (or power) to force  
you to reveal your key, the problem now becomes:

How can you prevent the government from proving you have encrypted  
documents?

One Answer: Don't keep encrypted documents in your possession.


Somebody could create a Document Server to store encrypted documents.   
Users would somehow get an anonymous Document Server account number when  
they subscribe to the service.  Users would use the remailer system to  
send encrypted documents to the Document Server.  The account numbers  
would be used to organize the document database and for billing (the  
tricky part).


Given a Document Server, the problem now becomes:  How can you prevent the  
government from proving you use a Document Server.  This seems like a  
strictly technical problem, unlike the "can they compel you to reveal your  
key" problem.
