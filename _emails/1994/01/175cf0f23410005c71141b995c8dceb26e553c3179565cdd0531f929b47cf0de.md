frode@toaster.SFSU.EDU (Frode Odegard) asked the rather sweeping question of
why governments get bigger.

Actually, this is one of the great (but often unsung) libertarian  proofs.
Governments act as any rational being acts -- in their own self interest. As
the distillers of laws and collectors of taxes, however, they just have a
better shot at self-interest nirvanna than the rest of us.
