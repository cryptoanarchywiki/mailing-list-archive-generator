So far you're right on...no attempt at anonymity.  I have never felt the
need to cower behind anonymity.  I take responsibility my actions, right
or wrong.

Okay, you're starting to veer away from reality a bit here.  Yes, I did
all those things.  But it was not an 'attack'.  I started out sending
unsubscribe requests to *both* owner-cypherpunks and cypherpunks, every
few days.  Those were the only addresses I had.  I was last week receiving
50 messages a day.  I accidentally deleted some of my real mail going
through and deleting all yours.  As I have said many,  many times, I
thought I was subscribing to a periodic newsletter.  There was no warning
that I would receive 50 messages a day, and apparently no mechanism for
gettin of the list once I was on.  I simply made ever more vehement requests
to be removed from your list.  As each one was ignored, I stepped up the
volume of my requests.  After about 10 days of no response (short of some
foul-languaged vicious flames from your readers furious because I bounced
one or two of their letters - but they couldn't understand why I was 
unhappy about receiving 50 unwanted letters a day).  What you call a
'mailbomb' was the only action out of everything I tried which actually
got some response.  Let's stay clear on this:  all I ever wanted, and
all I want now, is TO BE REMOVED FROM THIS LIST.  I am still receiving
messages even though the administrator told me after the 'mailbomb'
that he had removed me from the list.

I don't hide.  In fact, hiding would have undermined my purpose.  I was
trying to draw attention to my ignored requests to be removed from your
list--that's all.  No secret spy-novel conspiracy stuff here.  

Stay clear on this:  I have no desire whatsoever to waste your time or
undermine your ability to have your forum.  I simply demand to be 
excluded.

You seem to be framing this as some sort of terrorist action.
Once again, I was just trying to get some response to my ignored requests.
By the way, I sent a warning out several days before the 'attack' stating
that if I did not get removed, I would try to shut down your remailer.
That got no response.  And, in all my protests before the
'attack', I got many flames from you people but nobody told me how I
could GET OFF THE LIST.

Now you've really lost me.  Presumably, you did not like the fact that I
shut down your remailer.  But the very next day you send me a step-by-step
guide on how to do it more effectively and with anonymity.  Go figure.

Oh, I think I understand now.  You're trying to give people ideas about
how to bomb me, right?  Trying to start a war??  Am I mistaken in sensing,
Eric, that you are enjoying this?  Well, I am not.  Why don't you just
do the reasonable, mature thing and just allow me to be excluded from
your forum.

Again, again, again: I have no desire to sit around trying figure out 
ways to cause you trouble.  All I want is one thing.  Can you guess 
what that is?  I thought you could.

I don't want anonymity.  My name is Chris Schefler.  I WANT OFF YOUR LIST.
If you do not take me off, I will take appropriate measures again.  
Perhaps I will take some of your suggestions.

As I said, I am still receiving your messages.

Eric - what is the problem.  What don't you understand about this:

TAKE ME OFF YOUR LIST.  NOW.  Get on with your life, please, without me!
