  Crypto Experts Oppose Clipper

     More than three dozen of the nation's leading cryptographers,
computer security specialists and privacy experts today urged
President Clinton to abandon the controversial Clipper encryption
proposal.  The letter was coordinated by Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility (CPSR), which has long sought to open
the issue of cryptography policy to public debate

     The group cited the secrecy surrounding the proposal,
widespread public opposition to the plan and privacy concerns as
reasons why the initiative should not go forward.

     The letter comes at a crucial point in the debate on
cryptography policy.  An internal Administration review of the
issue is nearing completion and the National Security Agency (NSA)
is moving forward with efforts to deploy Clipper technology in
civilian agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service.

     CPSR has sponsored several public conferences on
cryptography and privacy and has litigated Freedom of Informa-
tion Act cases seeking the disclosure of relevant government
documents.  In one pending FOIA case, CPSR is challenging the
secrecy of the Skipjack algorithm which underlies the Clipper
proposal.

=================================================================


January 24, 1994

The President
The White House
Washington, DC  20500

Dear Mr. President,

     We are writing to you regarding the "Clipper" escrowed 
encryption proposal now under consideration by the White House.  
We wish to express our concern about this plan and similar 
technical standards that may be proposed for the nation's 
communications infrastructure.  

     The current proposal was developed in secret by federal 
agencies primarily concerned about electronic surveillance, not 
privacy protection.  Critical aspects of the plan remain 
classified and thus beyond public review.  

     The private sector and the public have expressed nearly 
unanimous opposition to Clipper.  In the formal request for 
comments conducted by the Department of Commerce last year, less 
than a handful of respondents supported the plan.  Several hundred 
opposed it.
 
     If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that hope to 
develop new products will face extensive government obstacles.  
Cryptographers who wish to develop new privacy enhancing 
technologies will be discouraged.  Citizens who anticipate that 
the progress of technology will enhance personal privacy will  
find their expectations unfulfilled.

     Some have proposed that Clipper be adopted on a voluntary 
basis and suggest that other technical approaches will remain 
viable.  The government, however, exerts enormous influence in the 
marketplace, and the likelihood that competing standards would 
survive is small.  Few in the user community believe that the 
proposal would be truly voluntary.

     The Clipper proposal should not be adopted.  We believe that 
if this proposal and the associated standards go forward, even on 
a voluntary basis, privacy protection will be diminished, 
innovation will be slowed, government accountability will be 
lessened, and the openness necessary to ensure the successful 
development of the nation's communications infrastructure will be 
threatened.

     We respectfully ask the White House to withdraw the Clipper 
proposal.

Sincerely,

Public Interest and Civil Liberties Organizations
