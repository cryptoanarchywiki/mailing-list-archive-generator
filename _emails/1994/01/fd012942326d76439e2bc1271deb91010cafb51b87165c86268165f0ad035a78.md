>Thank you for response.  If I may give some unsolicited advice, I would
>take a "Margaret Thatcher" approach to the postmaster who is allowing this
>problem to fester.
>
>I would (1) trace down his office phone number (through nic whois or
>nslookup or whatever) and ring him up and explain that allowing abuse of
>the Internet is an abrogation of his company's contract for obtaining an
>Internet connection, and that if he doesn't consent to handling this problem
>appropriately, you will seek to have his company disconnected from
>Internet based on that abrogation.
>
>If he doesn't succumb to that threat, I would then (2) phone thru his
>company's main switchboard and ask to be connected to the postmaster's
>boss, and explain to the boss that you will be seeking to have his
>company's Internet connection ended due to the postmaster's
>irresponsibility in allowing an unstable person to wreak havoc on the
>worldwide computer network community.
>
>Now while it might be a pain to actually follow through on this threat, if
>you put enough of a poker face on what you say, the bluff might very well
>be enough at either step 1 or step 2.
>
>Good luck!  And I hope I don't have to deal with this problem!  (But if I
>do, I've outlined how I will proceed.)
