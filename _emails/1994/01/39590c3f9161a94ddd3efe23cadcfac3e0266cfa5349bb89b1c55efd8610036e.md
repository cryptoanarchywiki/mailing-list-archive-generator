Julian is the head of ACNS (Academic Computing and Network Services)
at CSU, and has no direct influence on lance, since lance (the network)
is run by Engineering.  Stew is the chief guy at ACNS, so is no help either.

Both are very powerful people, with lots of clout/respect around CSU,
but neither are in charge of LANCE.

Just fyi.
