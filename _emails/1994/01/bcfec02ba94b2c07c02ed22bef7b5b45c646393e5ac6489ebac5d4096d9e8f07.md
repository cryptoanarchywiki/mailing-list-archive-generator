Cool.  Another paradigm is to think of the Document Server as an anonymous  
digital safe deposit box server.

A user could purchase, via anonymous digital cash, X megs of space up  
front, and then fill it up with whatever bits they wish.  However, done  
this way, management of the contents of the box would be left to the user.    
Perhaps the service would offer specialized boxes for different types of  
contents.

Just random thoughts (well, not provably random thoughts, of course).
