From an AP story Jan 4

President Clinton commended the nation's fallen spies and their
colleagues of the Central Intelligence Agency on Tuesday, saying
espionage helped win the Cold War and now is needed to guard against new
evils.

Addressing hundreds of CIA employees on his first visit to the
top-secret agency, Clinton said ``the new world remains dangerous'' as
threats of terrorism, ethnic conflict and militant nationalism challenge
the intelligence community.

About 400 workers crowded the marble lobby of the agency's headquarters;
others lined hallways, watching the president's address on TV monitors.

The employees applauded several times as Clinton paid tribute to their
work at a time when some critics are questioning the agency's role in
the post-Cold War era.
