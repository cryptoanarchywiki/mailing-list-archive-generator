C'punks,

Nobody wrote:

    You know, this radiation experiment reminds me of
    another incident. A group of African-American men were
    injected, without their knowledge or consent, with live
    syphilis spirochaetes, and studied for a number of
    years.  No attempt at therapy was ever attempted, as I
    recall, for these individuals. . . .

Actually, this is wrong on two counts.  One, the men were not
injected with syphilis; they had already contracted it when they
went into the program.  Two, in most cases, they *were* given
therapy.  What was withheld was penicillin.  The subjects who
were treated, were given relatively ineffective and dangerous
mercury therapies.  Not as bad as Nobody said, but more than bad
enough.

As an aside, I was watching a documentary on this sad chapter of
American history and they interview the guy who blew the whistle
on the study.  He was a San Franciscan I have known for several
years.  In all that time, I thought he was just another Second
Amendment, gun nut, fellow traveller.  You know, you never know.
