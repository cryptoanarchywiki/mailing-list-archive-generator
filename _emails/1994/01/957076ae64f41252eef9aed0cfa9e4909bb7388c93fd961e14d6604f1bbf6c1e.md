duplicate message if you got one.  -dave


My company, RAF Technology, is hiring for two software positions, a
Senior Engineer and a Software technician.  We want to hire right away,
but as always want first-quality people.  Please pass this on as you
think appropriate.  Here are the net postings for the two positions.

Thanks!
