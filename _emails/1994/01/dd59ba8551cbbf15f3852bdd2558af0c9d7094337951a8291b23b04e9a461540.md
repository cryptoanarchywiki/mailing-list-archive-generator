I would like to verify this.  Please forward whatever direct
proof you have, including message-IDs and date/time stamps.
Anonymous or forged postings that don't point to
*.lance.colostate.edu as the source will not be considered.

Seems reasonable though I won't do anything without additional
proof.  I will be speaking with Mr. Detweiler, but I must also
respect his rights and first need to hold confirmed evidence of
wrongdoing before I can justify any action against him.
