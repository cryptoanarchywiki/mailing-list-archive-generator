Could someone e-mail me intructions on exactly how to compile the damn pgp23A.tar.Z in my Netcom account? I get,
make: Fatal error: Don't know how to make target `suncc' and such when I follow
the instructions. I did get the unproto utility as it said, but what do I do
with it? I tried following the directions, but they are, as PGP, cryptic.

Thanks.
