Dear List,

     Actually what  I am looking for is a country like Switzerland or 
Lichenstein where a numbered(or anonymous) accounts are possible
and where confirmation of deposits(wire transfer) can be done to
the Internet(note that direct internet connectivity is NOT required)
only Email.... Anyone know of Institutions like this(i.e. email addresses for
correspondance are needed)
