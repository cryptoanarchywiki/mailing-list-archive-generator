Good summary. I miss have missed the subtleties the original poster
(DrZaphod, as I recall) was making, about only a partial emulation. I
had assumed the idea was to defeat the Clipper proposal by
substituting a chip either not implementing all Clipper features
(notably, key escrow) or different in some other way.

"Socket compatible" is more than just matching up some voltages on
some pins, etc. The new chip must of course operate with the software
of the Clipperphone, or the jig is up and there's no point in even
dropping in a new chip! This was, as Mike correctly notes, the
starting point for my analysis.

If the new chip does not even work with the Clipper software, does not
behave like a real Clipper chip would, what's the point? Surely the
Clipperphones will not be bought and then modified because they are
"cheap." And if we do our job, they will not be _ubiquitous_ either.

Some of the plans underway for Soundblaster card-based voice
encryption (probably using CELP on a fast 486 machine, or faster) seem
more rewarding.

Yep.
