Additional reference was made during the interview
to a "proxy board being seperate from export violations" ?
and he supposedly was a member of the proxy board,
he also made reference to "the new mccarthyism" and complained extensively
about unfair newspaper editorial coverage and made reference
to reporters reading "some conspiracy theorists book" (Bamford "Puzzle Palace"?)

The aboce snatches raise important questions
could Bobby Inman former head of NSA be involved in a
conspiracy to end run ITAR??? Can ANYONE illuminate this issue?
Ted koppel made the reference that that last exchange
probably lost most of the viewers... what is going on here???
John Gilmore did you see and hear this what was Inman referring to?
and does it involve DELL or other private companies?
