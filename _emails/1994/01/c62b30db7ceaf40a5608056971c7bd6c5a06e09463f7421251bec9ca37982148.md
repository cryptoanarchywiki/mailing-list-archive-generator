Yeah, I guess I should have proofread that better.  You are correct.

I was stating that it was possible to narrow your search significantly
if d*e=(p-1)(q-1)+1.   In retrospect, it was probably a mostly
irrelevant tangent.

-> The correct equation is

You mean   1 = d*e mod (p-1)(q-1)   Right?

-> or, in other words:
->
-> 	d*e = k(p-1)(q-1) + 1

Yup.

Oh.  Okay.  That was not made clear in the original post.  Yes, I can
see how that could be a problem... and random padding would solve it.  
I don't think that would actually reveal the secret key, but the message
could be decrypted...
