I don't know what (if) I read this in any books or mags.  I would 
recommend MacTutor(name may have changed)  I had read it all through 
college and worshiped it.  You can find it at *the Book Stop* if you 
know where on is.  You can benchmark you routines fairly easy. Before 
you call your function get the ticks off the clock then again 
afterwards, then get the difference.
ie
   ...
   start=GetTicks();   /* I think this was call, check the toolbox */
   foobar();
   total_time=GetTicks()-start;
   ...

One more thing, I left out another optimization kludge.  Try to 
reduce the number of calls outside your function by moving the code 
it is calling to inside the function.  This reduces the associated 
overhead of jumping (jsr $xxxx).

Also, if you have to go through the "toolbox" check into the
function GetTrapAddress(). Do this for Moveto(x,y) and then you can 
bypass the entry point of the toolbox and go directly to the routine 
in ROM.  This should shave off 5%-15% on the execution of toolbox 
calls.  DO NOT HARD CODE THE ADDRESS IN YOUR PROGRAM!  YOUR PROGRAM 
WILL DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH ON ANY OTHER MODEL! Use GetTrapAddress().

Hope all this helps. Let me know how things work for you.
