Actually, I would like *not* to discuss this on Cypherpunks, not
because it is not an interesting subject, but because this issue (and
related issues such as archiving/republishing FAQs) are being
discussed in a number of other places, notably the faq-maintainers
mailing list, several of the news.* groups intermittently, the
moderators mailing list intermittently, and some of the legal-interest
groups on Usenet.

Besides, cypherpunks is already very high-volume (even if you don't
count the Detweiler spew) and the issue is really not that closely
related to the purpose of the list (though there are some tangential
points).
