 suspect Dr Dobbs will have to register as an arms dealer fairly soon as 
their publication of a CD including all articles and source code
from jan 1988 to june 1993 includes several source code included
encryption artilces of the heading that could conceivably fall under ITAR
I notice they chose NOT to include 1987, perhaps because
of the RSA RATFOR article?? This should prove interesting...
