   There is an excellent essay in the December 21 issue of *The Village 
Voice* that talks about, among other things, the distinction between 
anonymity and pseudonymity in the NET (on MOOs in particular). There has 
been a small amount of calm discussion about pseudonymity on Cypherpunks, 
and I don't want to revive the embers; but the distinction the VV author 
(Julian Dibbell) makes between the abusive behavior often masked by 
anonymity and the more mature concern for one's pseudonymous reputation 
would make good background reading for anyone wanting to mull over this 
issue in print.
