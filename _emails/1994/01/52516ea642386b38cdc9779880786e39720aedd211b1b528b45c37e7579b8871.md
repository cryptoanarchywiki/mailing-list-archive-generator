Many thanks to the dozen or more people who helped me locate RFC-822; I now
have a copy of it, along with RFC-821 and a multitude of pointers to sites 
that keep RFCs available for anonymous FTP. I greatly appreciate your time
and effort.

[Flames and rants aside, the 'coffee house' crowd still comes through in a
pinch...  :)   ]
