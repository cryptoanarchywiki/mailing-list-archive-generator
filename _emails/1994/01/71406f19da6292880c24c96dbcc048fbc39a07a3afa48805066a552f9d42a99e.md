Yes, when something fascistic like Digital Telephony or Clipper comes
along, we have to fight it. But if we win, it will just return the next
time something scares the government. There can be no permanent victory
through politics. The only way to win permanently is to hold them off
through politics and public opinion long enough so that everyone has
encryption and is using it. If it's widespread enough, it will be
impossible both technically and politically to stop it. Stalin refused
to build a phone system in the Soviet Union, because he considered
it subversive. Could the government take away all our phones today?

Yes, we have to mobilize around the Zimmermann case, and if he actually
goes to trial, I'm going to send in my contribution and try to get others
to do so. Perhaps the next version of Secure Drive should have a request
of the form: if you like this product, please send a contribution to the
Phil Zimmermann Defense Fund. They may be able to single out individuals
who have put themselves on the spot, but they can't stop the technology.

>we have to rely on the very political and non-technological Fifth Amendment
>(an amendment which Mike Godwin of EFF and others contend does not actually
>protect disclosure of cryptographic keys).  Again, we need to win
>political, not technological, victories in order to protect our privacy.

And the next time there's a Red scare, or a Yellow scare, or any kind of
scare, they will say "national security" or "public safety" and start
putting people in camps, like the Japanese. Political victories are
temporary. Whatever the Constitution says, the fact is it has been 
blatantly ignored every time the government imagined a threat, starting
with the Sedition Act only a few years after the Bill of Rights was passed.
The Supreme Court has never stopped one of those actions until after
the scare was over.

>Look at the difficulty in keeping PGP available in this country even though

Yet almost everyone I talk to has a copy. It's on BBSes all over the
country, and hundreds of thousands of people have it. Maybe millions,
worldwide. I've sent it to many people by modem and on disks. It's even
on CD-ROMs. Are they going to confiscate them all?  What are they going to
do, shoot everyone caught with a copy? That is bad for public relations.

Ultimately the people have to want it. Very true. And the best way to get
them to want it is to provide it. Let them see how much more freely they
talk when their mail is encrypted. How they can write and store what they
want, when their hard drives are encrypted. If the public experiences
real privacy, they will want it, and it will be harder to take away.
They will even be willing to buy it. In the long run, PGP may well be
the best thing that ever happened to James Bidzos, just like the pirating
of Altair Basic was the best thing that ever happened to Bill Gates.

Politics, the process of politics and the political mindset, is our enemy.
Governments cannot create freedom; they can either leave it alone or
take it away. We must prevent them from taking it away, until it is so
widespread and universal that it can't be taken away.
