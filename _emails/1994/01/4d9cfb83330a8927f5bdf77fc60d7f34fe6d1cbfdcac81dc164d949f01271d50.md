The detman has been blathering for weeks about how he will subvert the list
and we now see all sorts of rants impugning the reputations of certain 
cypherpunks. Postings are reiterated with the message that so and so said 
this or that and this person is a nazi, or some such drivel. I have no idea 
who said what because many of the technowizards don't avail themselves of the 
technology which they themselves have made available and promote as a  
powerful new tool for the future. Positive reputations? Without an electronic 
sig, you don't have one. Future? It's here. If even we don't use the available 
tools, then they are indeed worthless.

Expect a long campaign of det-rants if people don't take steps to negate
this bullshit now. I personally don't want to see the list go back to the 
way it was in the days of an12070. Many of you have been hard at work 
developing NET tools for the future, I applaud you for it but it seems that 
you will soon need them-like now. It's a pain in the ass for me to sign stuff
and I am probably the least techno-capable of all of you. I do it because
I see the writing on the wall, you see it too. The time is now punks.
