Is there some reason why lots of 'punks _aren't_ running a simple script 
that will, say, fire a message to one's self through a chain of remailers 
every time you log on or at random intervals or something?

This may be an imerfect solution to the problem of traffic analysis, but 
it's so uncomplicated that there seems no reason not to do it. And if there 
were fifty or a hundred people or so making a practice of this, it seems to 
be agreed that the remailers would be a great deal more secure than they 
are now.

This is a nice little opportunity for everybody to help out the remailer 
operators. God knows, this list seems to be capable of generating 
sufficient noise -- all we have to do is harness it :-). The question is, 
how much traffic is _too_ much? Recommendations from remailer people?
