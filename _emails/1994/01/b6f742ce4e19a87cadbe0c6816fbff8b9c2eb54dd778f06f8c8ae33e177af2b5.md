Noone persists in the belief that absolutely no "psuedospoofing" is
occurring on Cypherpunks. What is patently obvious, however, is that
Detweiler makes wild and unsubstantiated charges against others. Please send
me a small selection of his 1000 messsages that he feels prove
the charges he has been making. Otherwise, let him keep his delusions to
himself. His behaviour concerning these absurd claims that
Tim May and Eric Hughes (neither of whom I have met) are criminals
is completely unacceptable to reasonable people. I urge Detweiler to
bring forth proof or shut up.

Has he ever considered how sociopathic it is for him to whine
about how painful a particular letter or article is to him and yet
he never seems to care about the hurt he's causing with his
apparently groundless charges concerning TC May, Eric Hughes, and
Cypherpunks list members in general ????
