Re. government radiation experiments, radium dial painters, & Marie Curie.

Many of the radium dial painters received _stupendous_ doses.  So, I
surmise, did Marie Curie.

Marie Curie, unlike many of the dial painters, lived to a relatively ripe
old age.  She might done better if she hadn't added the dose of a zillion 
X-rays to the dose from her internal radium burden.

Interestingly, her husband was killed when he was run over by a horse-drawn
cart.

Anyway, the recent revelations should remind anyone who needs it how much
trust should be accorded government. 

I'll stop preaching to the converted.
