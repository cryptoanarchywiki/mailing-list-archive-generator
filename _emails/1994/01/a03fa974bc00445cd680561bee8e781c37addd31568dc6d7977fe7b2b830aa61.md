I just talked to someone at AT&T Surety Systems.  The TSD-3600c (the one
with the clipper chip) will be available next week. The person I talked
to would not elaborate as to the present backlog, but said it "wasn't
just one or two".  I asked if the backlog was related to orders for the
Department of Justice (DOJ), and was told that availability next week
was in addition to those "set aside" for delivery to DOJ.  (I didn't
think to ask about a DOJ delivery schedule.) 

If I hadn't just spent the money on fencing for corrals and paddocks, I'd 
order a couple to play with.  Maybe I have room on a credit card...
