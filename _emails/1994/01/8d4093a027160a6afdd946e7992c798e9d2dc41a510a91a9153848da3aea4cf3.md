  Cash need not remain as untraceable & anonymous as it currently is.
If you look at a piece of US paper, there is the embedded strip
(material?) on the left side giving the denomination and the
computer-readable serial number in the upper right and lower left. All
that's needed now is a law requiring merchants to scan bills as they
come in and go out.  Considering the federal activities in the banking
world, such a law is not out of the realm of possibility.
