Sorry for the bandwidth. It is only Tuesday and has already been a long 
week. :( 

Any orders placed outside of the US, paid by check drawn on a US 
bank are acceptable. Our screening company has expressed concerns over 
dealing with checks drawn on non-US banks, so we are avoided this type of 
payment.

If anyone has any further questions, or special circumstance, send me a 
note and I'll see what I can do. Thanks again.
