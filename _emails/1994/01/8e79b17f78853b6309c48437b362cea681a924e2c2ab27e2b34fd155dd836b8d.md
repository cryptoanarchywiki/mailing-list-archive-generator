Actually, we set them up.  They appear to be real.  Note, this is not an
endorsement!!!  I have no dealings with iia.org directly.  I know only
what I've heard around the office.  They dropped big bucks for a router
just for this service.  The guy who sent that message appears to have
been looking in all the wrong places.  Military hosts tables are
infamous
for their incompleteness and for their tremendous lag time.  Whois does
indeed have this site's info, and has since December!  The sender
probably looked in the DDN whois DB which is only for MILITARY SITES.
The correct site to check for everything else is rs.internic.net.

BTW, I faxed the company an account request back in October (and again
in November) but have yet to hear anything from them.
