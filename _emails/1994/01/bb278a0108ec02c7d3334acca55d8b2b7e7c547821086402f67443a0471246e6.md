Hello all,
   I am considering writing a research paper on how the
constitution will hold up in light of rapidly changing technology and the 
use of it.  The main issue I plan on addressing is the right to privacy.  
My concern is that I will not be able to find enough "scholaly works"
that address this issue.  I know that opinions abound, but I am in need 
of citeable sources.  Any ideas?  Has much been published on this issue?

Thanks,
Roy
