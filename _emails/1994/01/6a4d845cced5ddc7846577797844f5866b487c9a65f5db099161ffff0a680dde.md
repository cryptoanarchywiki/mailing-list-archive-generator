This may sound like a question that I should probably already know,
but it would appear not.
 
How do I change my key ID to reflect my current ID?
 
For instance:
 
If my key ID now reads              <me@here.net>
                     also known as  <me@there.com>
 
 
 and I wanted to change both of these a different, singular address;
                                    <me@where.edu>
 
Is there an easy way to do this?
 
Many thanks in advance!
