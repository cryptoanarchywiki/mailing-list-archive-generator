That reminds me of my first reaction to CypherPunks: why would the government
spend thousands of $$$ of supercomputer time & mathematician brains to see
your miserable piece of information, when all they have to do is lock you up
at the back of a countryside garage,  beat the shit out of you, inject
various chemicals into your blood until you spit out your secret key ?

That was a bit harsh, but, going back to the essentials, a crypto system
is as weak as its weakest link, isn'it ? Now that we've got them pgp, RSA and
IDEA and whatnot, fine, we've built a 20 inches thick steel chain around our
little secrets.

Except that this marvelous piece of technology is held together with a hair
strand: your brain.
Where you key is kept, and where everybody assumes it's safe.

Isn't time we take a look at another kind of cryptographic attack, the
ancestor of which bore the delicate name of penthotal ?

Nobody ever speaks of them chemicals that make you talk. But they exist,
and as well as cryptography techniques developed fast recently, trust the
government, those chemicals must have made a few advances.
Like, for example making you tell what you don't want to and then make you
forget about anybody asking.

Or maybe I watch too many serials.

Does anybody have informations about state of the art tell-us-you-story-pills ?
