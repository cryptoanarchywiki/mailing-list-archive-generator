	Which reminds me..

	I've recently started taking a class for the "American
Cultures" requirement here at UC Berkleey, about the "Languages of
America." In any case, I've been reading numerous articles about cases
in which people were *penalized* (mostly in school) for speaking to
their peers in their own native language as opposed to English, as
mandated by law.
	People have said, "Outlawing strong crypto is like telling you
tha you have to speak in a language they can understand." Don't be so
surprised-- it's been done before. (Not to as an extreme degree as
we're thinking about, but it *has* been done.)
