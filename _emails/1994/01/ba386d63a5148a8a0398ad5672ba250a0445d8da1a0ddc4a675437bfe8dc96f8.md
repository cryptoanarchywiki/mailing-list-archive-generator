I never did contact the author, but the stereogram code on soda had
one major byte-order dependencies in the file format -- I cheated and
just used emacs to twiddle the first four bytes of each of the data
files, and was able to get it to work (nice thing about having a sun
3/50 at home -- 19" monochrome monitor that works *great* for
these...) under linux. I've also seen code to generate ascii
stereograms, but don't have it online (yes, I only saw it on paper)
and don't have permission to post it in any case. The algorithm is
simple, though, and the program could be done as a short perl script...

I've never been clear on where to hide the data, though -- in the
random background pattern? in something that is visible at a certain
separation distance? (a friend had the admittedly odd suggestion of
hiding one stereogram in another, by having the image you see with
crossed eyes be a random dot pattern itself...)
