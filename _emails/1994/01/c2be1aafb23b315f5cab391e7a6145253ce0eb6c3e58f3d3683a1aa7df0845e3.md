I agree with this.  I don't agree personally with liberal democrat
interpetations of the 2nd Amendment.  The first 10 amendments are
the 'Bill of Rights' and are individual rights.

I'm not a democrat, republican, socialist or facist.   Please don't
give my rights away to support your point of view for some other
imagined or real right.

 I am not now nor have I in the past advocated the violent overthrow
    of the United States.

Resolved:  The 2nd Amendment has nothing to do with the right to
           Privacy, with or without respect to cryptography as a
           means to insure privacy from others or the State.
