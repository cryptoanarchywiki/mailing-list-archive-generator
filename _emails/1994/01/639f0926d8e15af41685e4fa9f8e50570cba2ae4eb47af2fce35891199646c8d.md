However, there would be a record of addresses which anonymous mail had
been sent to- probably not a good idea.  Julf's anonymizer has such a
record, but I thought part of the idea of the cypherpunk remailers was to
eliminate these records.

I do find the digital postage discussion interesting... perhaps this would
be a way Julf could pay the bills on his system.  How exactly would this
work?  Would a "stamp" be a large random number?  Would a stamp be tagged
to prevent use by another user, or remain individually anonymous, but PK
encrypted to the purchaser?  Would full fledged Chaumian digital cash be
implemented?

Perhaps creating remailer stamps would be the best way to actually
implement a test bed for the Cypherpunk Credit union.  Start small with
remailer stamps, work the bugs out of the system, then slowly expand.
