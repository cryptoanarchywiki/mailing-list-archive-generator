1. If you fake mail by talking SMTP directly, the IP address or domain
name of the site making the outgoing connection will appear in a
Received field in the header somewhere.

2. Fake mail by devious means is generally frowned upon.  There's no
need to take a back-door approach here--it's bad politically, as in
Internet politics.
