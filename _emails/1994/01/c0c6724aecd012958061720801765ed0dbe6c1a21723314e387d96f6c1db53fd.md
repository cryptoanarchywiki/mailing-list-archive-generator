It just occured to me that when this protocol is implemented with RSA, 
it is subject to a minor (and unlikely) failure that can allow Alice
to determine which video Bob has selected (or at least eliminate some
of them).  If each video keypair has a different modulus and the one
Bob selects has a larger modulus than some of the "dummy" videos, then
if the encryption of Bob's session key with his selected video public key 
results in a message that is close to the modulus itself, the keypairs
with moduli that are smaller than Bob's message can be trivially eliminated
as candidates.

Of course, Bob can easily test for this condition and simply select a new
key (or diddle a random confounder in the message) until the encrypted
message is smaller than the modulus of any dummy keypairs.
