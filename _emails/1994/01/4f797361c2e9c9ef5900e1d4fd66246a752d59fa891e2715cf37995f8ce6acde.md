My ten ears (Swedish coins) in the list filter/authentication topic:

List software filtering/authentication does NOT protect against fake posts.
If I don't use PGP and receive a signed letter from cypherpunks@toad.com, I
can't do a damn to check if it really is a posting or a forgery. To forge a
post, just send mail from cypherpunks@toad.com to all known posters on the
list.

Conclusion: The only purpose of list software filtering is to reduce
traffic. All checks of signatures (by poster or by list software) must
still be made by the list reader.

Opinion: What we need is better client software (intelligent mail sorting,
automatic checking of signatures, powerful browsing capabilities, etc).
When I have that I don't mind a few extra K's of mail (it doesn't cost
much, and I don't want to miss any information, even fake information).
Most of the noise isn't Detweiler, but replies to Detweiler (which isn't on
the list anyway).

BTW, What happend to MacPGP w/ AppleEvents?
