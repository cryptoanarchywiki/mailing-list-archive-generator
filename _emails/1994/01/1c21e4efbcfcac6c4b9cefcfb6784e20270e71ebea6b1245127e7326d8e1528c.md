I decided long ago that I did not want to participate in the Detweiler
sage.  However now I just can't keep my mouth shut anymore!

Do you fight noise by being noisy yourself??  To me you won't be much
better than Detweiler himself by adopting this aproach.  You have read
postmaster's statement on the Detweiler case, and in my opinion his
views must be respected.

It is a little strange to observe a group fighting for privacy and 
anonymity in the electronic community start whining about harassments 
from anonymous users.  We all know that cryptography, anonymity etc are 
two-edged swords, and we all have argued that the "good" properties more 
than offset the "bad" ones.  Now we have tasted one of the "bad" 
properties of anonymity on the net -- perhaps a healthy lesson.

The Detweiler problem seems to be solving itself.  I haven't seen any 
posts neither to this list or to any of "his" usenet groups lately and 
postmaster indicates that it is Detweiler's intention to stop the 
flooding of the net.  It is only us other users, now including myself, 
who keep the memory of Detweiler alive.  Let's give it a break.
