Internet", and present some of the latest business resources available
on the network.

DR. MARY J. CRONIN has more than 20 years of experience in information

College, and teaches information management at the college's School
of Management.  Dr. Cronin has written articles about business and the
Internet for Computer World, Internet World and Database magazines.
