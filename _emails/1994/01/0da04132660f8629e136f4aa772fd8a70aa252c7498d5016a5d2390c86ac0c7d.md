How to use the hh@soda.berkeley.edu Usenet poster and Anonymous Remailer
by Eric Hollander

This document describes some of the special features of the
hh@soda.berkeley.edu remailer.  Because this remailer is essentially just a
modification of the standard Cypherpunk's Remailer, I recomend that you also
read soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks/remailer/hal's.remailer.gz.

= What does this remailer do?

This remailer allows anyone who can send mail to post to Usenet newsgroups,
and also to send mail to anyone else on the Internet.  Both of these
functions can be anonymous (the identity of the sender is hidden from the
recipient) or non-anonymous (the identity of the sender is known to the
recipient).

= Why is this remailer different from the standard Cypherpunks remailers?

The main difference between this remailer and the other Cypherpunk remailers
is that this remailer allows posting to all Usenet newsgroups, either
anonymously, or non-anonymously.  It also has the regular remailer functions
of forwarding mail, either anonymously or non-anonymously (nonymously?).
The other minor difference is that this remailer adds a random time delay
for anonymous mail and posting.

= A note about header fields

This remailer/poster looks at the header of the mail you send it to decide
what to do.  Some mail programs don't allow easy editting of the header.  If
your program doesn't allow editting of the header, you can still use the
remailer.  To do this, send mail in the normal way, but start your message
like this:

	::
	Anon-Post-To: rec.fish

leaving no blank lines before the :: and a blank line after the header field
to be inserted.  The remailer will consider the line after the :: to be a
part of the header.  All of the instructions bellow can be used with actual
header fields or the :: format.

= How do I use this remailer to anonymously post to Usenet?

Send mail to hh@soda.berkeley.edu with a header like this:

	To: hh@soda.berkeley.edu
	Anon-Post-To: rec.fish
	Subject: I flushed a fish on Friday

	On Friday, I did a terrible thing, so I'm posting
	this anonymously...

This message will be posted to rec.fish, with nothing to indicate who was
the original sender.  Only the Subject field will be retained; everything
else in the header will be discarded.

= How do I post non-anonymously?

Send mail like this:

	To: hh@soda.berkeley.edu
	Post-To: rec.fish
	Subject: flushing fish

	How despicable of you to flush a fish!

This will be posted to rec.fish non-anonymously; the From and Subject fields
will be retained in the post.

= Crossposting

To crosspost, simply list the newsgroups, separated by commas, with no
spaces, like this:

	Anon-Post-To: rec.fish,alt.ketchup

Note that excessive crossposting is an abuse of the net.  Some people have
to pay for their news, and they don't want to read "how to make money fast"
in rec.fish.

= Testing

I recomend that you post test messages to make sure you are using the
remailer properly.  Please post these messages to the appropriate test
groups (alt.test, rec.test, etc).  Also, if you post non-anonymously to a
test group, many sites will send you mail confirming that they have received
the post.  To avoid this, put the word "ignore" in the subject line.

= Anonymous mail

This remailer is capable of sending anonymous mail.  To send mail to
foo@bar.com, send a message like this:

	To: hh@soda.berkeley.edu
	Anon-Send-To: foo@bar.com
	Subject: Ronald Sukenick

	I think you should read something by Ronald Sukenick.

and foo@bar.com will recieve the message, without knowing who sent it.

= Non-anonymous mail forwarding

This remailer supports non-anonymous mail forwarding.  To use this feature,
send mail like this:

	To: hh@soda.berkeley.edu
	Send-To: foo@bar.com
	Subject: you know who I am

	This mail is from me!

= Testing mail

Please test the anonymous remailer functions before you use it "for real" by
sending mail to yourself or a friend.

= Chaining, encryption, and other issues

These features are discussed in detail in
soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks/remailer/hal's.remailer.gz.  While you're
looking at that file, you might also want to check out PGP in
/pub/cypherpunks/pgp.  If you haven't installed PGP on your machine yet, you
should try it out.  This remailer doesn't yet support encryption, but it's
coming soon.

= Remailer abuse

This remailer has been abused in the past, mostly by users hiding behind
anonymity to harass other users.  I will take steps to squish users who do
this.  Lets keep the net a friendly and productive place.

= A note to ucb users

This remailer allows posting to ucb.* newsgroups.

= If you have other questions or problems

send normal mail (without any of the above headers) to hh@soda.berkeley.edu.
