C'Punks,

I was asked in private e-mail:

    So how does the average US citizen go about starting a
    Cayman Islands (or similar) corporation? . . .

Look in the advertising sections of international publications
such as THE ECONOMIST, THE EUROPEAN and THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD
TRIBUNE.  Every issue will contain several ads for incorporation
services.  These services exist everywhere, but for historical
and legal reasons, many have offices in the UK or Isle of Man.

Request information from every company with an ad.  You can save
big by doing a little comparison shopping.  Follow the ads for
several months, if possible, to see which companies stay around
and which are fly-by-night operations.  Even better, check back
issues from previous years to see if the same folks are still in
business.

The following, is a fee schedule from just one such company:

____JURISDICTION_________ANNUAL_FEES_________FORMATION_FEE_______

    United Kingdom      B#   32              B#  150
    Hong Kong          HK$ 1200             HK$ 2500
    Ireland            IR#   10             IR#  195
    Isle of Man         B#  285              B#  250
    Gibraltar           B#  250              B#  250
    Jersey/Guernsey     B#  600              B#  500
    Turks & Caicos     US$  300             US$  500
    Brit. Virgin Is.   US$  300             US$  500
    Bahamas            US$  100             US$  500
    Liberia            US$  100             US$  750
    Panama             US$  150             US$  750

Of course, these companies offer lots of other interesting
services, as well.  Come the crypto-anarchy--or just a simple
bank in cyberspace--and everything gets a lot easier, a lot
cheaper.  (If Detweiler thinks things are "bad" now . . . )
