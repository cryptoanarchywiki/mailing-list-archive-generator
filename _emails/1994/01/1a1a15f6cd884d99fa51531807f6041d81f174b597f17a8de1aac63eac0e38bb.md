Below is a press release posted by David Arneke of AT&T to the Telecom
Digest. It looks like the licensing chain goes RSA -> ISC -> AT&T ->
you, but it's encouraging that these libraries are available: they
offer good potential for continuing and even accelerating the spread
of strong crypto out beyond the bounds of the online world.

AT&T LICENSES LINKABLE CODE FOR SECURE SOFTWARE

     GREENSBORO, North Carolina -- AT&T is giving software developers
access to linkable code modules for encryption, public key exchange
and other communications security functions.

     AT&T announced today that a comprehensive library of linkable
code modules, including RSA security technology and the NIST Digital
Signature Algorithm, is available for licensing.  Linkable code is
available in the form of linkable object module libraries and Windows
Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs), which are under license from
Information Security Corporation of Deerfield, Illinois.

     "Electronic commerce has an inherent requirement for privacy,
data integrity, authentication and non-repudiation," said Larry
Salter, director of secure systems and services for AT&T Secure
Communications Systems.

     "These capabilities are ideal for PCMCIA and smart-card
applications as well as conventional software for PCs and workstations."

     The package includes code for DES encryption, the ElGamal public
key cryptosystem, the Digital Signature Algorithm, the Secure Hash
Standard and most RSA security functions, including RSA encryption,
key management and digital signatures; MD5 hashing functions; and the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.  A proprietary encryption
algorithm for exportable applications is available as well.

     More than a dozen military and civilian federal agencies and a
growing number of corporations have already licensed the code for new
software applications, Salter said.

     "This is a full range of information security functions, relying
on the most widely accepted government and commercial standards,"
Salter said.

     Prices for code packages containing DSA technology are $750 for
the DOS/Windows version, $1,000 for the Macintosh version and $1250
for the UNIX version.  For code packages containing RSA technology are
$300 for the DOS/Windows version, $400 for the Macintosh version and
$500 for the UNIX version.

     The license allows developers to load the code into two workstations
for software development.  Royalty payments are required for distribution
of applications to end users.

     Software developers can get more information on licensing the
AT&T linkable code module library by calling the AT&T Secure
Communications Customer Service Center, 1 800 203-5563.
