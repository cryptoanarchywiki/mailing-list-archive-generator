:> I understand how you can do 2-way anonymous communication via message  
:> pools and Penet-style systems, but I don't "get" prepaid mailers.  Could

:> prepaid mailers.
:
:I'll use Lisp-like notation to encapsulate the sending of a packet to
:a remailer "Bob." If Alice wishes to send a packet to Bob, she creates
:this packet:
:
:(Bob (more stuff))
:
:I'm assuming encryption, which several remailers support and which all
:users and all remailers should be using.
:
:Bob gets this packet, decrypts with his private key and recovers the
:"more stuff." He may discover "more stuff" contains some digital money
:for his troubles, instructions on how much latency (number of
:messages, for example) to use, and where to send the resulting packet.
:All kinds of stuff can fit in here. But that's not the point.
:
:If Alice wanted to send a message to Zeke, through a bunch of
:remailers, she might create this initial message:
:
:(Bob (Charles (Doris (Ed (........ (Zeke (final stuff))))....)))

[Lots of stuff removed]

:
:Well, enough for now. There could be some fatal flaws, but this is the
:direction I've been thinking about. Eric Messick and Hugh Daniel had
:some ideas about "onions" about a year ago, but I never fully grokked

This will not work if Yancy is not trustworthy. She could then send the
message through a chain of compromised remailers, to create the prepaid
mailer packet. This would also happen, though less harmfully, any time the
chain hit a bad node. Letting the nodes choose the other nodes is fatal.
