this is a good example of why we need pgp signatures on messages.  I 
would tend to not believe either of of them without confirming them.  
After all, any post that involves a "Detweiler may be right" idea, 
regardless of the context, is certainly not something most people would 
say.  And the other post just seems to be odd - someone who, for all 
intents and purposes, tends to have a functional brain, claiming that the 
government takes from him to give to "people of color" is overlooking the 
fact that the government will give money to anyone who labels themself as 
"disadvantaged" regardless of race, religion, favorite flavor of ice 
cream, etc.  Anyway, who are any of us to speak of nationalities anyway? 
dont we all look the same, ie. user@site.domain? I havent seen anyone 
start using white-user@site.domain, black-user@site.domain, 
asian-user@site.domain, etc.  Anyway, what do other people's motives 
matter anyway? this list is for cryptography last I checked.  And for 
every person who chooses to use it in a bad(pick a context) way, there is 
probably someone who wants to use it in a good(pick a context) way.

anyway, enough ranting and raving.  does the fact that I posted (a 
rarety) now qualify me for membership in the hidden-agenda tentacle club? 
=)
