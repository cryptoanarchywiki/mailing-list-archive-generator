These two nifty programs have been around for a while -- they are considered
"must haves" in any competent hack's tool kit. .-)

They are produced by a company called Sydex Software (support bbs at
503.683.1385) and prune.exe is especially useful to clear out buffer 
garbage between the <eof> marker and the sector boundary. 

Most folks know of their more popular programs, AnaDisk (a really
good floppy disk analytical tool) and TeleDisk (another nifty tool to
compress an entire diskette and its contents into a single, compressed
file for transport).

Cheers.
