Yes, this is a major security hole, but the Norton Utilities has included a
program to wipe these areas clean for a while now.  Of course, the Norton
Utils aren't freeware...

I've long thought that this was one of the greatest security risks in the PC
world.  People tend to be sloppy about keeping this "slack area" clean.  You
can easily give someone a copy of an innocent file that contains your secring
file for all to see at the end of it.
