Legal questions aside, one might hope that within the Cypherpunks at least 
there might be more of an ethic of respecting the wishes of an author. 
Edgar seems awfully casual about exposing other people to legal 
difficulties without their consent, and justifying that by some bullshit 
technicality doesn't change the reality of it one bit.

I for one am most unimpressed.
