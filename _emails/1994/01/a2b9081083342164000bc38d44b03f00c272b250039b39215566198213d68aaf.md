You can:

  - 1 - If the damage done you was real, not just an annoyance, then you might
litigate.

  - 2 - Otherwise, or if there is reason to believe that it was without
intent, then you could be a grown-up: live and learn.

Purile retaliation is the demesne of bullies and children.

This sounds like people who study martial arts so they can `really kick
some ass'.  Serious students of many disciplines consider it for defense
only.  This is the case with the technology of privacy.

You have seriously mistaken this list.  This is not a list of `expert
electronic vigalantes' who deal out home brew justice.  This is a group of
people with concerns about technological encroachment on personal privacy,
and ensuring that the information age doesn't swallow law abiding citizens
into a new world of glass houses.

I am sorry to say I can easily imagine what you must have been reading to
give you this impression.
