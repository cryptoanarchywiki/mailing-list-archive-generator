This message forging may be about to become a major problem. In his last
post "Current Operational Status", S.Boxx spewed forth:
(I hereby flame myself for quoting Detweiler - so don't bother)

---snip---snip---

Operation Octopus - this is the multiple pseudonym and agent project.
We plan to have at least a dozen (hence the name) posting
simultaneously to many different lists and the newsgroups. But the
overhead on this is very significant, and it will take us awhile to
gear up and build the infrastructure to the point we can `engage'. You
have seen more of these agents lately `out there', but our coordinated
attack will take some more planning.

Operation Duplicity - extremely top secret. Let's just say, you will be
seeing double, and triple, and quadruple, and ...
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
---snip---snip---

If he starts flooding the newsgroups, what can we do about it?
I'd watch for forged messages and posts, and if you don't have a key
on the servers, check to make sure a forged one isn't posted.
