Sigh. Why do you associate this garbage with the cypherwonks list owner?
And who are you refering to by that? Unfortunately *I* am the physical list
owner, as I offered to host the list on lists.eunet.fi to channel away
the Detweiler discussion from cypherpunks. And I *know* I didn't
send that stuff!
