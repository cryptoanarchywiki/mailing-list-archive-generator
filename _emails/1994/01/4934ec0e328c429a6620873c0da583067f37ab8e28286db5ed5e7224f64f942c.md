We need to get off the snake/tentacle thing (and *I* am not
a tentacle).  To start getting us off the subject, I have an
appropriate eecummings poem:

when serpents bargain for the right to squirm
and the sun strikes to gain a living wage-
when thorns regard their roses with alarm
and rainbows are insured against old age

when every thrush may sing no new moon in
if all screech-owls have not okayed his voice
-and any wave signs on the dotted line
or else an ocean is compelled to close

when the oak begs permission of the birch
to make an acorn-valleys accuse their
mountains of having altitude-and march
denounces april as a saboteur

then we'll believe in that incredible
unanimal mankind(and not until)

                e.e.cummings

This, and more, poetry is available from ocf.berkeley.edu
in the /pub/Library/poetry directory.
