Unfortunately, no, there isn't an accepted convention for tear-lines
that cut off the bottom of a message.  The top is handled adequately.
Julf's anon.penet.fi remailer  cuts off anything resembling a signature,
using the convention that a -- line (or maybe an all-dash line?)
is a signature, since some of the common mail and news programs use that,
but the regular cypherpunks remailers didn't the last time I checked.
It would be nice if there were an official syntax, either something
formal and mimeish, or a simpler '--truncate here--' sort of line
that gets retained across remailing so additional junk doesn't accrete.
