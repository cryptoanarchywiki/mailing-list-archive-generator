Apologies if this shows up twice. My first try seems to have gotten lost...


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----


Curve Encrypt 1.0, IDEA encryption for the Macintosh is now available for 
ftp from ripem.msu.edu, directory:

pub/crypt/other/curve-encrypt-idea-for-mac

Read the file pub/crypt/GETTING_ACCESS for information on how to get access 
to the ftp site. I plan to also make CE available through csn.org (Mike, 
are you listening? Your mail is bouncing).

Curve Encrypt is a freeware drag-and-drop encryption application for the 
Macintosh. It uses IDEA cipher-feedback mode with a 255 character pass 
phrase, and encrypts both the data and resource forks of files. Source code
is provided. 


Distribution:

Curve Encrypt (c)1994 Curve Software. Permission granted for distribution 
within the United States only. 

It's fine with me if you make the software available by giving it to your 
friends, putting it on _local_ BBS's, taping floppies to stalls in the 
men's room, things like that. But don't export the software, and don't make 
it available on places like international anonymous ftp sites. And please 
make sure that the people you give the software to understand the export 
restrictions. This applies the application and the source and anything that 
_contains_ Curve Software copyrighted source.

Is this sufficiently clear to keep me from getting Swanked?



All releases are verified with PGP signatures. Public key:
