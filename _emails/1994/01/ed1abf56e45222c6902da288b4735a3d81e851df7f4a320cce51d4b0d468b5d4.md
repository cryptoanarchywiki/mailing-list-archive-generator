Check out:

http://monet.vis.colostate.edu/testing/mailer.html

It's a test of a remailer based in a WWW HyperText Server, coded by
yours truly.  You need a WWW client that supports "forms" to see it,
so try NCSA's Mosaic 2.1 for X. (available from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu
in /Mosaic -- they have binaries for most machines.)

Tell me if you would like to set one up for yourself, and I would
be glad to help.

Please realize that this is just a test.  Don't use it for remailing,
just for seeing if you like it.

Thanks, and have fun,

-nate
