Yea Yea!!  Well said...  I was just about to un-subscribe from this group,
although I plan on sticking around.   And I hope that we all have learned
about this double-edged sword (remailers),  and their implications.  So,
lets all get back to the job at hand,  and fucus our energy towards promoting
encryption,  freedom of speech,  and privacy!!!

And whats with all these empty mail headers with long "Apparently-To:"
lines?    Is something broken somewhere in the mailing list?

Cap'n Crunch
