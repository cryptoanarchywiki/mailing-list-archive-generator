also:
	4a)  Make sure the line pointing out that it was validated is part
		of the message, and not the headers, because some newreaders
		have a nasty habit of dumping headers that aren't recognized,
		or making them very difficult to find (you have to 
		remember to switch to full headers for pine, for example.)
		I would think that a line added to the end of the message
		as a trailer woudl work dandilly.

	5)  If there is no PGP signature, the message is bounced back to 
		the originating address.  Yes, this might bounce to a 
		non-existant one, but if joe@moron.com is trying to fake a 
		message from joe@foo.com, joe@foo.com would find out 
		about it then.  Also, make sure the reply-to: header is
		set so that messages bouncing due to a non-existant address 
		do lead to a loop.

Of course, there is the question of the reliability of the automated 
reposter... :-)

Keep it simple and functional, IMHO.
