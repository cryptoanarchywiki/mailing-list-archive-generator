Indeed.

I believe this; my point was simply to clarify.  I interpreted Tim's
note as having to do with reverse-engineering Clipper, while the
original note seemed more along the "plug and play" lines.  Now that I
think about it, it's probably the case the Tim didn't misunderstand at
all, but was on a tack about how you'd pretty much have to completely
re-engineer the thing.  Or something.

Seems like it'd be easier to compete with Clipper by simply building
an alternative from the ground up.
