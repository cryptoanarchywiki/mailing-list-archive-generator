"Classified algorithm for encryption"
IEEE Spectrum, April 1994. 


Federal policy makers should reconsider the Clipper/Skipjack cryptography 
scheme, which employs a classified algorithm and Government-held keys as 
the basis of a new encryption standard, according to a six-page statement 
by IEEE-United States Activities. "Federal cryptography policy should not 
fight technological progress by attempting to retain outdated techniques 
of surveillance at the cost of the reliability and the security of the 
American information infrastructure," the statement concluded.

The reasons given for issuing the statement included IEEE-USA's concerns 
that classified algorithms "cannot be proven secure," that individuals 
seeking to avoid detection would simply choose another cryptography 
method that can be downloaded from the Internet, and that law enforcement 
agencies can use other new methods--from vibration-sensing lasers on 
windows to keyboard-trapping programs. For more information, contact 
IEEE-USA at (202)785-0017.
