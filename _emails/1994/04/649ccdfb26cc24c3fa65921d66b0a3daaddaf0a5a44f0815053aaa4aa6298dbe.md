  Just last week the Michigan Secretary of State, Richard H. Austin,
proposed adding a magstripe to the driver's license. I don't recall
hearing information on what data would be stored.

  Also in Michigan news, the University of Michigan is moving to a
single University ID card (there are currently separate ones for
housing, staff, etc.). In conjuction with this move, one's University
ID number will no longer be one's Social Security number + check
digit. For some bizarre reason, however, the soc number still appears
on the back of the card--along with a magstripe using the ABA format.
A proposal to encode one's digital photgraph was, I believe, not
implemented--yet. Oh yeah, the card also has one's signature, but
instead of one signing the card before laminating, one signs on a
low-res graphics tablet and the digital image is affixed to the
card--I don't remember if it appears in the magstripe too.

  I have the UM score as:
	+ 5 for moving to a non soc-based id number
	+ 1 for not including a digital photo in the magstripe
	-10 for continuing to print the soc number on the card
	-10 for continuing to use place a written signature
            on the card
