I am amazed at the response to the anti-clipper t-shirt we created. If you
still haven't received your shirt, we apologize for the delay. Since word
spread around the Net, we have received hundreds of orders. A picture of the
shirt was included last week in an article in The Washington Post! We have
gotten orders from well-known cyber authors and an MTV veejay. I wonder if Al
Gore saw it...

As information has spread, it seems to have gotten a bit diluted. Here is the
information. The shirt says "Don't Give Big Brother a Master Key. Terminate
Clipper Now." It has a graphic of a skeleton key on a chip. The shirts are XL
and black only. I can't evaluate our own work, but everybody seems to like it
a lot.

We accept COD orders at iplus1hope@aol.com ($14.50) and check orders ($12.50)
at PO Box 59152  Renton, WA 98058.

Thanks.

Paul Clark
