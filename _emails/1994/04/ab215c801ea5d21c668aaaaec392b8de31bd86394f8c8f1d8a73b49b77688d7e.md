Subject: ViaCrypt PGP and Linux

A short note to say that the SCO version of ViaCrypt PGP for Unix 
works under the latest version of the ibcs emulator for Linux. 

If you have ViaCrypt PGP for Unix and want to give this a try, you 
need a recent Linux kernel (1.0+), and the following file available 
by anon ftp 
tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/ibcs-940422.tar.gz 

Be sure to get this version, and not one of the earlier versions.

Disclaimers
1. My only connection with ViaCrypt is as a customer.
2. This message is provided _AS IS_. In particular, this may not
   work for you. I assume no responsibility for actions you may
   take partially or wholly based on this message, even if
   I have been negligent in some way by posting this message or
   not correctly verifying the content of this message.

In other words, if you buy ViaCrypt PGP for Unix based on the fact
that you believe you'll be able to run the SCO binary, and you can't
make it work, don't come crying to me saying that you spent money based
on my message. Fact is, it works for me, but that is all I'm saying.

Sorry to be so pedantic, but given the way the world of Linux is, I'd
be a fool not to say it.

Mark
