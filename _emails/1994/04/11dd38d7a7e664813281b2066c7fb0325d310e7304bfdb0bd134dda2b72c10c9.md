  No, my writing ability is not in error here -- my mental model of
the history of DES is what is in error.  I will now update my personal
model of DES development to include two steps at IBM.  Lucifer ->
proto-DES at IBM, and proto-DES -> DES at NSA.  Learn something new
every day...  Since about 1977 I wondered what the 'rediscovered
crypto techniques' were.  Thanks!
