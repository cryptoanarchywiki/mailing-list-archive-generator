   Experience from the Extropians list. A large number of people
made the mistake of inserting blank lines between commands and
some people's mailers did it automatically (one of the more
stupider one's actually removed a leading colon from the line
changing ::exclude to :exclude) I got a lot of complaints, so I removed
the restriction of single blank lines being able to terminate. In fact,
the regular expression which parses lines looks like this:

/^\s*::\s*(.*)$/

  So that spaces are allowed before and after the '::'

  On the extropians list, an arbitrary amount of whitespace is allowed
because ':::' is used to separate command blocks from the body of
messages.

   I thought of MIME, but I didn't know it was so popular (I last
looked at it over a year ago). I just looked at the comp.mail.mime
FAQ and the RFCs and I see that MIME is gaining momentum. Two problems
instantly jumped out at me when reading the MIME documents:

1) more than 2-level encodings are not supported (no recursion)
2) no application/viewpgp  or transfer-encoding: pgp type

   MIME actually takes care of the multipart issue nicely. I'm going to
do some more research and I may end up scraping ::envelope if MIME's
encapsulation is powerful enough for inter-remailer I/O. (the one
pain in the butt is that now I will have to process the headers
instead of throwing them away) Perhaps the PEM/MIME documents will be
of help.

   Correct. You don't want headers to be visible during the chaining,
and the remailers throw away incoming headers. Therefore, I felt
that ::@ shouldn't be applied until the message is posted or
sent to a real e-mail address. Any suggestions on a better
method?

   You could concentrate your trust on the first remailer in the chain.
Once it goes through that remailer, it is now encrypted for the
recipient and the source of the message is destroyed. Keep in mind,
the other remailers in the chain can not snoop on the message because
it is encrypted for the recipient automatically (if a key is present).
The other remailers can do traffic analysis if the user doesn't
use any wildcards ("*"), but this can be limited using recursion. e.g.

::envelope PGP 
::to remailer1
::envelope PGP [for remailer 1]
::to remailer2
::envelope PGP [for remailer 2]
::to remailer3
::envelope PGP [for friend]
::to friend@college.edu

   I agree most of the power should be in the client (hopefully,
my approach allows both a powerful client or simplemail use), but
there also needs to be a "lowering of transaction costs" as Eric
suggested. Many people don't have unix accounts and with the advent
of Compuserve/Delphi/Genie/AOL internet gateways, some sort of
server approach is required.

   Part of the reason for including a socket-server in the remailer
is to allow clients to hook into the network and get data fast.

   If I understand correctly from my fast reading, it does: the
multipart/partial content-type. (the comp.mail.mime faq is an example)
The hurdle is getting a MIME type registered which can recognize
pgp encrypted and/or signed messages.

   Correct. It would be used with the "*" feature and also the
auto-chaining. (if a user just says ::to friend@college.edu, the
remailer may choose to chain this through several other remailers
automatically)
