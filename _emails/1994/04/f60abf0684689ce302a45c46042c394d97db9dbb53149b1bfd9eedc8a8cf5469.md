I think you may be confusing the notion of "unbounded" with the notion of 
"finite".  The Big Bang is perfectly consistant with the notion of a 
finite but unbounded universe.  

On a completely different note, physicists were planning to rename the 
event which created the universe after complaints from feminists that 
"Big Bang" was a sexist term.  Does anyone know what new name was 
ultimately selected?
