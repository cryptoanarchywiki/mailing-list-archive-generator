There is no "court case pending against Phil Zimmerman."  Neither he nor
his legal counsel have been notified of any action against him.  He has
not been named publically in any official papers.  He has not been
subpoenaed.  There *is* an insvestigation of how PGP was exported (nothing
about its *creation*).  Two firms have testified before a Grand Jury.
