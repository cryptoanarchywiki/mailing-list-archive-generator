"Gary Jeffers" says:
[Some stuff about software pirates and system crackers on IRC]

Myself, I'm not very fond of either group -- they can find out about
PGP and the rest on their own as far as I'm concerned. Just because I
think people have a right to privacy and to use encryption doesn't
mean I'll necessarily deliberately seek out unsavory groups to
evangelize to. I'll be happy when everyone, whether they are doing
anything they feel is sensitive or not, especially if they are
breaking no laws, uses encryption.
