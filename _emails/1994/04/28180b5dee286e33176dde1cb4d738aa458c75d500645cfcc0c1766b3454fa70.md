somebody (was it gtoal?) said something yesterday about how you could have
the remailer encrypt the address of the person sending it and put that
encrypted address in a block at the end of the message.  this would be a
good way to do it because the remailer operator cannot reveal a database of
aliases and also not having a database makes the remailer easier to maitain
and operate, resulting in a remailer with response capabilities, and yet as
easy to use as the traditional cypherpunks remailer.

i thought that was a cool idea, so i implemented that on the soda remailer
(remailer@soda.berkeley.edu).  give it a shot.  just use it as you normally
would and you will see how the response feature works.  or finger
remailer@soda or send mail to remailer@soda with Subject: remailer-info.
