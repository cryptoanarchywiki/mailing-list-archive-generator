Have you seen the prices of used original NeXT equipment lately,
or just the prices of single system boards from back in the 68030
era?

Anyway, why do you need a DSP? I have read in several places that
DSP's are going to be "replaced" by the CPU as time goes on and the
CPUs just get more and more powerful.
