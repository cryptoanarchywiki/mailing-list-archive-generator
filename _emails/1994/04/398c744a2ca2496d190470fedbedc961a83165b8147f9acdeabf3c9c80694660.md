Did anyone ever think that maybe, just maybe, PGP was developed, and before the
programmer started giving it away for free, that he was paid by the government
to give them the key which can unlock ANY PGP locked document/file/etc???  I
mean, wasn't it kind of surprising that the government would make such a big
deal over this?  To make hackers/phreakers in general think that this was the
greatest encryption scheme available today for free (the programmer was paid 
to distribute his software for free, seeing that the sum was sizable), they 
made an act by (i don't know the specifics) arresting him, telling him to stop
distributing, etc... Makes you wonder huh... It's possible.  Maybe he wrote in
the PGP program a loophole in the encryption so that he could decrypt anything
that was encrypted by PGP.  Maybe he is big brother.  Maybe big brother is
running him... I mean, has anyone ever gone thru the entire source code and 
checked if this PGP is a valid encryption scheme, or just the gov't slipping
in their clipper thing without us knowing it.  Reply here--no email please...
