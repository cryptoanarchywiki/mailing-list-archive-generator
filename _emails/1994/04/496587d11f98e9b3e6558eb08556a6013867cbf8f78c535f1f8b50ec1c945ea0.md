Guess.  Read that word again; it's important.

_If_ they're right.

So then, let's take the probability of guessing right at 1/2.

[then is described the double-up strategy]

Here's the flaw, in full glory.  This scheme is the classic
double-or-nothing martingale.  It doesn't work.  The "relatively deep
pockets" of A have to be infinite, because that's the expected value
of the amount of A's intermediate loss in the random walk to the
completion of the transaction.

The example is ludicrous, but the conclusion is valid.  More
transactions means more interactions between them and more possibility
to hide something inside the ever-increasing flux.
