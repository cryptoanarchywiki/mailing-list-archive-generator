Yeah, aside from the privacy problems here, there are other reasons for
not looking at mail going through your remailer.  I run a remailer, and
one night a few weeks ago, we had a power failure here during the night,
so the system got hosed.  When I was setting it back up in the morning,
I saw the incoming mail which hadn't gone into the filter.  Well, there
were some messages in there which ... well, let me just say that someone
was using my remailer for a purpose which I would have rather not known
about.  Sometimes ignorance is bliss.
