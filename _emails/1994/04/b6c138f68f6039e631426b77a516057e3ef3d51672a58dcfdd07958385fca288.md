For full-scale general-purpose computers with post-Pentium CPUs,
it's probably more cost-effective to do any number-crunching in the CPU,
though you can get a lot of crunchons for $25-50 of DSP these days
(if you're willing to add the cost of the I/O interfaces for it.)
Any extra price-performance you gain by skipping it makes the whole 
system faster, and if you need real-time audio-hacking you can
handle the extra OS overhead if your OS is well-designed.

However, for a cheaper single-purpose device like a fancy-processing phone 
(whether crypto or high-quality speakerphone or whatever),
the main activities are modeming, A/D conversion, bit-crunching 
(mostly signal-processing flavors), and some call-setup signalling.
A/D converters live on chips, DSPs are real good at digital signal processing,
modems chips are cheap and software on DSPs is another approach,
and the call-setup logic can fit on almost anything as long as 
you've got some spare ROM space; your design sophistication and
cost analysis will tell you whether you want to do it on an 8086
(or similar flavor of cheap microcontroller), which has enough horsepower
to do 10 kb/s of crypto in its spare time, or whether to add some 
program complexity to the DSP instead (popular if you're building ASICs).

Several of AT&T's DSPs have a miminal operating system built in which lets
you switch between different programs easily during processing
(I think it's non-preemptive, so you have to plan a bit in your code,
but it only burns about 5% of CPU for typical applications.)
