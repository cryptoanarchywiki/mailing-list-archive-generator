This would really simplify the strategy of chess...
	Smirnov		Jagermeister
1.	Wn !!		Rsgn
Commentary: Smirnov's "White wins" opening gave him an early and
dramatic tactical advantage.  Jagermeister showed foresight and
played "Black resigns".

This whole argument is getting rather weird, its topicality aside.
There are a finite number of legal positions in chess.  If any
shows up a third time, the game is over.  Thus we have a bound on
the length of a legal chess game.  Hence the number of games is
finite, and we don't have to quibble about whether it's countably
or uncountably infinite.
