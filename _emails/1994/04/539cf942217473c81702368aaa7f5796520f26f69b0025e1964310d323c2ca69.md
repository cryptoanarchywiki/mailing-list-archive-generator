I saw a couple interesting licence plates on cars at work.  One was

2PGP386

Now, that's a valid ordinary sequentially issued plate.  But I'd still say
the owner of that one has the right idea. :-)

Another one on a car I've seen many times is

68 ASCII

I don't have an ASCII chart available.  What does this one mean?
