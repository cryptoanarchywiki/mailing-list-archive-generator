Hello from Cypherella!

Thanks for your interest in Stego. I have prepared this note
to answer most of the questions I've been asked about Stego.

1. Where is Stego?
Stego was moved from the /Recent directory to the
compression utilities directory '/cmp' in the info-mac
directory at sumex-aim@stanford.edu. You can download the
Mac version from there.

2. Is a PC,DOS,MSDOS version coming?
I have not been developing one, for lack of suitable
hardware. Fortunately, bart.simpson@glib.org, has developed
a PC version that operates on TIF files, and Colin James
Maroney informed me that he's made a PC verson that operates
on GIF files. He is shag@oregon.uoregon.edu. I haven't tried
either of these; I hope they're useful.

3. How can I get a copy of Stego by mail?
Send a check or postal money order for US$15 and your
address to:

Romana Machado c/o
Paradigm Shift Research
19672 Stevens Creek Blvd Suite 127
Cupertino, CA 95014

You will recieve the latest version of Stego and news about
updates and future products.

Thanks again for your interest,

Romana Machado

Note: Many of you recieved this a blind cc, as a privacy protecting measure.
