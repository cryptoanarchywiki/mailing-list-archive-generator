* Gun control is people control. - Gary Jeffers

   Why hasn't anyone discussed the utility of phony names in the
phone books for fooling state investigators? If you have an unlisted
phone number & a state snoop asks for your listing, the phone company
will also check the unlisted numbers. What would happen if you had
a phony name that the phone company agreed to use. Would the snoops
be thrown for a loss? Could phony names be even better than unlisted?
The phone company would probably demand your real name for billing
purposes.
                                             Yours Truly,
                                             Gary Jeffers
                           PUSH EM BACK! PUSH EM BACK!
