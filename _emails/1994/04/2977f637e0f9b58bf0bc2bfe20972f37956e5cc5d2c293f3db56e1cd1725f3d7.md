This seems like a strange comment since DSP's are general purpose
processors that are optimized for a certain range of price/performance.

Actually, I've been seeing hints that most systems will start
augmenting the main processor with DSP's to solve the realtime /
multiprocessing problem.

Zyxel modems have 2 DSP's + a 68000.

I've been reading up on them recently...
