I suppose the most serious issue is the internal abuse of power by
government employees.

We all know that california DMV operators sell drivers records to anybody
for small amounts of cash.

We all know that social security people sell employment history on any
social security number to anybody for small amounts of cash.

We've seen political power blocks abuse their authority by investigating
opposition groups.

We all know the "posse" would have everybody's keys on a brown bag full of
DAT tapes within weeks of going live.

Look at what bozo 9-X did with everybody's PIN number in their latest
phone card mailing!!  They printed people's PIN numbers on the *OUTSIDE*
of the envelope!!!

Why make it easy for them?

Moral: Thou shalt not give power unto the gestapo or the bozo - or thou
       shalt be sorry in the long run.
