    I thought he said "if p prime, then p|(2^p-2)" which is why
I stated the converse isn't true.

   Which is why I chose it. Carmichael numbers are pseudoprime in
any valid base so when coming up with a counterexample to the converse
of fermat's little theorem, just memorize a few Carmichael numbers. The key 
property of them is if n is a Carmichael number and n=p*q*r, then (p-1), 
(q-1), and (r-1) divide (n-1).

   I wonder if Carmichael numbers always have some small factors. If true,
PGP's sieve test probably eliminates the very very rare case that
you actually choose one.
