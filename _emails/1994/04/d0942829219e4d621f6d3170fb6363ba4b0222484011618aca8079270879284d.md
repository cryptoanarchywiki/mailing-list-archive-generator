I don't want to start a huge debate on this, I just would like to know if
those who object to this object on grounds of practicality or ideology (in
other words, for example do you object because you don't believe everyone
is *entitled* to a job, or because you think it is idealistic and silly to
write something like this when everyone knows capitalism requires
unemployment.)
