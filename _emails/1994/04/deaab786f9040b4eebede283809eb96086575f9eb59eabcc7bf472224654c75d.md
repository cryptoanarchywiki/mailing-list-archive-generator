"....... I just would like to know if
those who object to this object on grounds of practicality or ideology (in
other words, for example do you object because you don't believe everyone
is *entitled* to a job......."

having a job = making a living using $
"a living":          having an idea of a kind of life to live
pre-requisite:  having a purpose in life
requisite:          arranging your life to realize (achieve) that purpose
                           following-through on the work required
                           adjusting things around you to suit your 
interest/sensibilities

It would be impractical for another person to deliver all of these 
things for me at their expense, when they should be spending time on 
their own dreams & plans.  It does not represent an ideal method to me 
to have my lifestyle delivered to me, while aiming to be an 
independent, autonomous individual with a mind of my own.

Otherwise I would be obliged to serve the purposes & interests of those 
who supply the means, the job, the money, on their schedule; that is, 
whenever they could think of something for me to "do" on the entitled job list.
