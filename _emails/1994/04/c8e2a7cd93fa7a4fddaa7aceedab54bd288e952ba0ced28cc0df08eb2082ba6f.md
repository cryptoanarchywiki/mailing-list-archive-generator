Unusual use of the word 'subsidized'...  Most of the above I would
just call indirectly funded.  I don't think you'd say that corporate
employees get subsidized pencils just because it's an expense item for
the corp. and they buy in bulk.

I guess what you meant was 'institutionally supported'.  'Subsidized'
normally means gov. grants to me.  (Yes, a fraction of the above
examples get gov. grants specifically for Internet expense, but not
most.)

Thanks for the clarification.
