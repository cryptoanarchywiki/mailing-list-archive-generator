===========

Just so as not to generate any more wasted bandwidth here, 
or is that waste more generated bandwidth, whatever,
I will forward any suggested changes to the Cypherpunks Quick Code
to Wendell Noseworthy for insertion into the next offically 
cypherpunk-agenda-approved release of the Cypherpunks Quick Code.
Send them to me...

	Bill Garland,
		whose .sig does channeling for a small fee
