  Are there any lawyers that can comment with certainty?  I'm not qualified
  to answer this point.  (I did post since it was my original point that
  is being referred to.  My opinion is that a landlord can not further limit
  that which the state laws protect... but that is opinion)

  This topic may have merit here since it started as (forgive the paraphrase)
  "We want to make cyber laws and here is the stupidity that is happening
   in the real world... we have a lot of work ahead of us."  Anyone care to
   offer an opinion on this discussion's merit here?
