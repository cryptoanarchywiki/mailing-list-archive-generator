  Are you saying that IBM developed DES entierly on their own?  This
doesn't fit my model at all.  But, I'm not afraid to be wrong.

  Gladly! Please tell (learn) me: what was the history of the
development of DES.  How were DES, IBM, NSA, NIST (then NBS), and FIPS
related?  Wasn't there some concern on IBM's part about liability --
Thus the us Governments participation, including the 'secret' changes
to DES?

  Why would I do that?
