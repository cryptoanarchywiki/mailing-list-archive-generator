This may sound like a stupid question to most of y'all, but Tim
brought up the Internet Casinos concept in one of his statements
following-up to the money laundering thread, so I thought I'd
ask:

Given that even I, in my isolated little backwater of South Louisiana,
find myself withing 20 miles of a casino, is it possible that the
market is saturating to the point where an internet casino would not
neccesarily be a good idea?

If there is real anonymous untraceable digital cash for money
laundering with, will "real" casinos see their profits decline
as digital money sucks away that part of their business?

PHil
