I have received several phone calls today from people who read some
sort of April-fools posting on some newsgroup that I had been arrested
for PGP-related stuff.  Well, it isn't true.  I'm still at large.
I'm still unindicted.  And still not sued.  Someone had an idea that
this would make a funny April fools joke.

I hope this clears things up.  Feel free to repost this message to
all the relevant newsgroups, because I can't do it because the newsreader
at my sight is having problems.  I hope this cuts down on the phone calls.
