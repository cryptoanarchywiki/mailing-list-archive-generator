Just thought I'd let you know about this heading, in
case you are debugging anything...

I wonder how this would jive with the factoid someone on this list (don't
have the original handy) found a while back about the court ruling in favor
of the right to operate under an alias in (constitutionally?) protected, at
least in terms of publishing, etc.? I remember the case happening in L.A.,
I think. Anyway, what are the odds a case could be made that my 'anonymous
identity' "fooperson" is a legal pseudonym? Stretching it some, but a
possibility, and one case where similarities with publishing can work in
favor of privacy.
