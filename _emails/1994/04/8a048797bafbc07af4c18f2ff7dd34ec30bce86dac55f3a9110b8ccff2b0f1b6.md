  I also agree with Russell.  Although the organization for which you work
  may be unnerving to some, they should be willing to give you a shot at
  being an ok kinda guy as a freethinking individual.


  Besides that, has anyone considered this:
	 If the good Sargeant here gets his system secured with PGP 
     and Uncle Sam (via the President's efforts) says everything
	 else is bad, you must use clipper... wouldn't it be good
	 ammo to say 'Hey guys!  Site x.y.z is secured to military
 	 satisfaction by using PGP.  Clipper is somewhat weak and you
 	 even admit it by not allowing it to secure classified info.
 	 I think it would be great ammo in blowing up the Information
 	 Super-Highway-Patrol.
 
   Keep asking your questions and thinking freely!
 			Jim
