Okay, my memory has been jogged... is this a paper by Pomerance, "On
the distribution of pseudoprimes"?  He gave more precise estimates for
the number of base-2 pseudoprimes.  

With his more precise estimates, the chance of a 100 digit number
passing the base-2 pseudoprime test is about 1/10^13...

I think his work applies only to base-2 pseudoprimes, so my statement
concerning the error rate of Miller-Rabin is still correct: for s
iterations, the chance of failure is 2^-s.
