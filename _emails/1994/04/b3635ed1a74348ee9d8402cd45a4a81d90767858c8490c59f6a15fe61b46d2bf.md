   There has been some criticism of the ethics of my THE FREEDOM DAEMON
post. The freedom daemon is a proposed software machine for a proposed
furture in which a police state captures the Internet. Under a police
state & in times of strife, ethics change & things that were at one
time unthinkable become quite thinkable. However, this speculation
was just a flight of fancy, so go back to sleep & don't worry your
precious little heads.
                                           Yours Truly,
                                           Gary Jeffers
