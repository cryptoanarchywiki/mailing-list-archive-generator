The assertion that the NSA is manipulating the executive borders on the 
indefensible.  The NSA make educated suggestions in their field of 
expertise.  The President worries about the policy implementations from 
the executive.

If the NSA is really in control, why the hell are they doing public 
relations instead of remaining the super secret agency they would much 
prefer?

This is simply a re-hash of the old arguement I had with tmp@netcom.com.
I expected more.

The problem with your potential crucifiction is that no body gains for 
your death.  You are not Jesus.  We do not profit if you are imprisioned.

An aware, informed, and actively participating population being your 
target, you will want to reach as many people as possible.  I think most 
will agree that you tend to the fringe right now and thus your audience 
will be limited.

An anarchy with local lords controlling individual participation. 
(System admins)  An anarchy with regional economic powers that charge for
inclusion.  (Service providers) An anarchy with an organized watchdog 
group.  (CERT)  An anarchy subject to the laws of the participants 
residency. (MIT bust)   An anarchy with export regulations.

Some anarchy.

It seems to me you're talking about goals, not reality.

Have to have a real anarchy first.

Harass the NSA.
Win the press and the people in the process?

If that's what your proposing, I really can't follow you, and I think the 
majority of the population will tend to think along the same lines.

Look, I really don't object to your goals.  I'd like less regualtion too.

Unfortunately distributing restricted documents at will and declairing 
psy-warfare on the NSA probably won't get you there.  I hope I'm wrong, 
and I hope you do it all by yourself, but I have to ask the question, had 
the document been top secret, or even just confidential, would you still 
have spread it around so easily?  To me that reflects a lack of judgement 
and recklessness.  I tend to think of actively subverting an intelligence 
agency the same way.

Better in my mind to learn and act in a guided way, not throwing every 
stick and spear and gernade that comes to hand at the target.

What you seem to be looking for is change, NOW.
THIS SECOND.  If this is your timetable, I hope you like bloodshed.
