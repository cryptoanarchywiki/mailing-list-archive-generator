Does it concern anybody besides me that the CIA [with a bunch of 
underemployed manpower] is jumping into bed with the FBI [whose
spokesman recently testified to Congress that they didn't have 
enough manpower to enforce the Crime Bill on us]?

Does it make anybody nervous besides me that this is occurring 
at the same time that the 2ond and 4th amendments are being 
dispensed with?  While the Clipper chip and digital telephony
bill are being foisted on us?

Is there a trend here?

Ties to political aspects of crypto ought to be pretty damn 
obvious.

William J. Clinton, on MTV:

<>
<> [...]       Now, having said that, a lot of the Asian societies that
<> are doing very well now have low crime rates and high economic growth
<> rates, partly because they have very coherent societies with strong
<> units where the unit is more important than the individual, whether
<> it's the family unit or the work unit or the community unit.
<>
<>              My own view is that you can go to the extreme in either
<> direction.  And when we got organized as a country and we wrote a
<> fairly radical Constitution with a radical Bill of Rights, giving a
<> radical amount of individual freedom to Americans, it was assumed
<> that the Americans who had that freedom would used it responsibly.
<> That is, when we set up this country, abuse of people by government
<> was a big problem.  So if you read the Constitution, it's rooted in
<> the desire to limit the ability of government's ability to mess with
<> you, because that was a huge problem.  It can still be a huge
<> problem.  But it assumed that people would basically be raised in
<> coherent families, in coherent communities, and they would work for
<> the common good, as well as for the individual welfare.
<>
<>              What's happened in America today is, too many people
<> live in areas where there's no family structure, no community
<> structure, and no work structure.  And so there's a lot of
<> irresponsibility.  And so a lot of people say there's too much personal 
<> freedom. When personal freedom's being abused, you have to move to limit 
<> it.  That's what we did in the announcement I made last weekend on the 
<> public housing projects, about how we're going to have weapon sweeps 
<> and more things like that to try to make people safer in their communities.

Guess Who?

  Here is the theory:  "It is thus necessary that the individual
  should finally come to realize that his own ego is of no importance
  in comparison with the existence of his nation; that the position
  of the indiviual ego is conditioned solely by the interests of the
  nation as a whole .. that above all the unity of a nation's spirit
  and will are worth far more than the freedom of the spirit and will
  of an individual..."

  "This state of mind, which subordinates the interests of the ego to
  the conservation of the community, is really the first premise for
  every truly human culture...The basic attitiude from which such
  activity arises, we call - to distinguish it from egoism and
  selfishness - idealism.  By this we understand only the
  individual's capacity to make sacrifices for the community, for his
  fellow men."

  These statements were made in our century by the leader of a major
  Western nation.  His countrymen regarded his viewpoint as
  uncontroversial. His political program implemented it faithfully.

  The statements were made by Adolf Hitler.  He was explaining the
  moral philosopy of Nazism [National Socialism].
