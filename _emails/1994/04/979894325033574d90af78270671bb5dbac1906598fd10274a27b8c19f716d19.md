	One of my dreams is to be running/a-part-of my own
backbone.. but not a backbone in the current hierarchal organization,
but more of a web. . . each site connected to about 3-4 other sites
(relatively local.. maybe in neighboring regions of the country) with
highspeed links, and decentralized..
	The net may be decentralized, but not decentralized enough.
