I suspect Eric's memory was influenced by his memories of last
Saturday night, after the Cyperpunks meeting and after the Dave Emory
lecture a half dozen of us saw that evening.

We all decided to attend the midnight showing at the Stanford Theater
of a new Indian film, "Rendezvous with Ramanujan," based of course on
the famous Arthur C. Clarke novel, and directed by noted British
director, G. H. Hardy (no relation to Norm Hardy).

Our taxi had the license plate number "RSA-1729," which we took to be
a pun about the next big factoring project. After all, 1729 is a
rather unremarkable number.

The taxi driver, an unemployed mathematician named Ted Streleski, was
heard muttering, "Some squares, some cubes."
