Maybe of your game.  My game is to get cryptography available to all,
without violating the law.  This mean fighting Clipper, fighting idiotic
export restraints, getting the government to change it's stance on
cryptography, through arguements and letter pointing out the problems (I
love Phil Karn's CJ request, because it points out some of the idiocy
behind some of the regulations).  This means writing or promoting strong
cryptography.

By violating the law, you give them the chance to brand you "criminal," and
ignore/encourage others to ignore what you have to say.

I'm not sure I understand what you are saying here.  Them being the laws or
the government?
