"Is too." 
"Is not."

In this case, "rare" is accurate when applied with respect to the long
history of US government involvement, not to this particular
president; as you point out, this is the second time that Clinton has
inserted himself into the loop. It wouldn't be too surprising to see
him do it again.

However, this sort of intervention *is* rare by past standards. Do you
recall any non-FMS contracts where Presidents Bush, Reagan, Carter, or Ford
went to bat so overtly for US products?
