Almost everyone posting on this subject keeps forgetting that this isn't 
an exercise in probablity theory.  These are rigged transactions.  The fix 
is in.  A broker in on the deal assigns the wins and loses *after* the 
trades are completed.  This is not conjecture; I used to work for someone 
who--by his own admission--used to perform a similar service for clients.

P.S.  I'm not picking on Eric, he just had the most recent post.
