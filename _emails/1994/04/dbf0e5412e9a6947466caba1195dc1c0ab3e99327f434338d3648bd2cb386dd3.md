The obvious implementation is to add a Generate-Return-Address: header 
so you can use it if you want it, but won't get one otherwise.
The encryption definitely needs some sort of random padding,
though CBC with a random IV plus length-padding at the end
should probably suffice.

Public key has the advantage that the operator doesn't *need* a database.
If you want to implement use-once addresses (or use-N-times),
you could include a tag with the address (such as the IV),
and reject future messages using that tag (e.g. save a hash of the tag).
You could also implement time-limits by including an expiration date.

Perhaps something S-Key like might be applicable, if you want to stick
to private-key methods?

Matt Ghio's remailer+62647629379278@wherever.com syntax does this fine.
If desired, you could implement anonymous bit-bucket addresses
this way as well, though they're somewhat more useful if your remailer
generates encrypted outgoing messages.  Alternatively, you can *always*
generate either a real or a bit-bucket return address, and leave it up to
the sender to inform the recipient that there's a probably-working return path.
