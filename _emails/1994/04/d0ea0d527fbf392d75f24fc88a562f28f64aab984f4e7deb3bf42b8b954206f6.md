I am thinking of composing an essay for my WC203 course.  I was wondering
if anyone who has a second could send me a message with their cumulative
GPA. 

If you have already graduated, what was your GPA?
If you have never attended school, lucky you.

Please send it with the subject: GPA.  Thanks.
