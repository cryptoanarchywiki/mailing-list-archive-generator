Actually, it is legal to use an alias for any
number of things, including the phone book,
*_so long as the purpose is not to defraud_*;
thus, using Mother Teresa Charities might be
so construed, while using Sam Jones probably
would not be.  There are prohibitions against
using false ID...driver's lic., passport,
and so forth...but not against using an
alias.  This is all after consultation
with my attorney...

As a side note, it is possible in Texas to
file an "assumed name" at the courthouse
of the county(ies) wherein you plan to
do business...costs about $15, including the
notary fees, and lasts 10 years.  You can
have almost anything for a name....and what
would be more natural than having your new
"business name" in the phone book?  Nice,
legal...and cheap (except a business line
is a bit more expensive).  Can this be done
in other states?

Regards,

Dave
