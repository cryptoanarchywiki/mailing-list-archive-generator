Wayne,
	I am sorry that my being on this list is offensive to you.  I joined 
this list to learn about cryptography.  If anything, I would think that you 
would want to help a new person get up to speed.  If you can't grow up and 
treat other people like human beings, maybe you ought to take yourself off of 
the list and go play with your private key by yourself.

	My job is important to me.  Learning about cryptography is going to 
help me protect my systems and my messages.  I have no desire to eavesdrop on 
what you or anyone else is doing on this list.  I merely want to learn, and 
possibly contribute to the threads on the list.  I have received several 
responses from people on the list and really appreciate that.  I hope this 
helps to clarify my position on this list.
