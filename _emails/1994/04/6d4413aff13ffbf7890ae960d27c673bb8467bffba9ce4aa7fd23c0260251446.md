Mr. Toal said :

What I found interesting was that it was published in Phrack about
a week ago, and nothing happened, but when Grady reposted it, suddenly

posts more diligently than everyone else's, or Grady went out of his
way to tell them that he'd posted it, which wouldn't surprise me...

This is partly up to Grady to verify, but I suspect the answer lies in
the different frequency and lag time between examination of the net
and examination of Phrack.

Grady's probably just got noticed first.
