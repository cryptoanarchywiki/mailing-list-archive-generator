The above listed information is NOT a name.

  Remember the price of being anonymous... Nobody has to believe a word you 
say.

  I've sat back and watched my box fill with bullshit for a while now, 
and I'm quite bored of hitting the delete key...

  I came on to this list after this "Detweiler" person was long gone.  I 
really have no ideas or impressions of this person.  I also have no idea 
who you are, but I am aware that there have been some inconsistancies in 
your behavior and knowledge.

  1)  You claim to be a reent arrival to this list, yet post messages
      that are inflamitory, and refer to topics that traversed the net 
      before your arrival.

  2)  In a recent post, you used the term "detweilering".  Funny, but 
      that term has never been posted in any public messages to you,
      yet was a common term...

  3)  In one message you use the phrase "Whoever this Detweiler person is",
      and then go on in the message to speak about his MO, which you, as 
      a new list member,  wouldn't know...

  4)  In a recent message you made a pun of testical/tentical... Before 
      your time, if you weren't lying about being new...


  Personally, I don't care who you are.  I do think you try to be an 
asshole, and you love getting on people's nerves.

  You have earned this flack.  Enjoy it.
