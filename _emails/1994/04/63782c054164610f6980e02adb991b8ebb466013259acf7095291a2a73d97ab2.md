Nothing is trivial if you find yourself banging your head on a problem to which
you have no immediate answer.  Here's the immediate answer:

	pgp -sta +clearsig=on message.txt

That's from pgpdoc2.txt.  Hope it helps.  You might wish to set up your mail
user agent to invoke this command upon exiting your default message editor,
with "message.txt" set to whatever your editor calls the temporary message
file.

No problem.  You might also consider taking the newsgroups sci.crypt and
alt.security.pgp.

Hmmm... you might find talk.politics.crypto interesting, too.
