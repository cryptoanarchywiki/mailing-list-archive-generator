First, it was discussed and commented upon when the "Time" article
came out. I remember several people forwarding the entire article or
portions of it.

Second, the relevant quote is already being included in some people's
sig blocks. For example:

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by
Yankelovich Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect
the privacy of phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to
conduct wiretaps. When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they
opposed it."  Philip Elmer-Dewitt, "Who Should Keep the Keys", Time,
Mar.  4, 1994.

I think it's gotten a _lot_ of attention. You just must be skipping a
lot of messages (understandable, given the volume).
