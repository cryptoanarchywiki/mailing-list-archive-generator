Obviously it doesn't map directly, but phones can provide a good example.
people can phone-bomb people, but it gets boring. Most prank callers ger
sick of it by the time they hit highschool. There are cases of prank
callers getting scary but these are pretty few and fall between. You may
say that the difference is that I have to have to be on the phone to do
this, which doesn't apply to computers- well, I can, using a Macintosh and
phone set up a pretty good combination war dialer/recorded message to bomb
everyone in my local access range. How often does this happen? and what
would happen to me if I did this? *There's* the key. You slap people's hand
for this kinda thing. If I send a 200 meg binary file to a site once every
15 seconds for a couple of hours, I get in trouble. Easy.

People talking about the future with computers always talk about ways to
make things impossible for someone to do- this has never worked in the real
world, and won't in the virual one. You just make it not worth doing.

See above- If I mount a denial of service attack on you via phone- tell my
computer to call you once every 15 seconds, forever, how long would it take
to get the cops to pay me a visit? About as long as it took you to find a
phone that isn't tied up by me ;)

I still agree- Whoever ends up standing to profit from this ain't gonna
give it way...
