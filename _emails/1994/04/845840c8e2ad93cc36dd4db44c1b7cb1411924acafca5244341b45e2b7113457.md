     Both of my remailers (nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu and
remailer@chaos.bsu.edu) support all of the above as of 4/2/94.

     Neither of my remailers supports encryption.  The bsu-cs one has too 
small of a quota and I haven't compiled PGP for the chaos one yet.

     I will write more later, but basically what you need to know is this:

	1.  The bsu remailers no longer paste ANYTHING from a "::" header
	    into the header of the outbound message.

	2.  They both support the "##" header pasting syntax now.  The "##"
	    block must come after the "::" block if both are being used or
	    else the "::" block will be considered part of the body of the
	    message.

	3.  They also support multiple recipients.  You can place as many
	    "Request-Remailing-To:" lines in the headers as you wish and
	    it will individually address and send each one.

	4.  Full debug logging has been turned on until I can verify that
	    both remailers are acting as they should.  This form of logging
	    includes a mirror of the message as it is received and a
	    one-line message listing each recipient.

	5.  The C source is available via anonymous FTP at:

	    chaos.bsu.edu:/pub/cypherpunks/remailer/chaels-remailer.tar.gz

	    It should compile as long as you have getopt().  There is no
	    fancy signal processing in this version.  Note that there is
	    nil documentation.  This is not a release.

     Apparently my other posting got eaten somewhere between here and 
toad...  Oh, well!
