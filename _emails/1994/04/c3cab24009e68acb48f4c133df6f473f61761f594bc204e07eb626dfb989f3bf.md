I have this book - "Cryptography and Secure Communications" by Man
Young Rhee.  It covers basic cryptography (number theory, DES, block
ciphers, stream ciphers, public key systems) and also communications
(BCH codes, Reed-Solomon Codes, Error control for cryptosystems).

Late chapters cover more crypto protocols (authentication, digital
signatures, ZKIP, smart cards, key management).

The book is pretty good, but Schneier's book covers far more
cryptographic protocols.  This one seems to be a fusion of
cryptography and error control coding.  But then, the author's
previous book was "Error Control Coding Theory."
