This is a little off-topic, but it does apply to authentication...

I have been abroad for the past few weeks. In the course of my travels, I
was given some data about a new program that the US Dept. of State/Customs
and Immigration people are moving into limited testing at JFK and LAX.

They want to implement a "fast, positive identification system to speed
processing of entrants to the United States by use of biometric data."
The system works by use of a handprint scanner, and a smart card.
Participants would go through an initial hand scan, and then be issued
a smartcard. Upon subsequent entries to the US, instead of going through
the normal passport check, you would place your hand on a scanner and insert
your card in the slot. The system would then positively identify you, and
clear you for entry.

I have no details about the format/security of the card data, and the INS
guy I spoke to made no statements about privacy, security or other uses
of their ID database.

If this takes off, the risks of it spreading to a national ID card, or to
the 'healthcare card' are obvious.

The above opinions are exclusively my own. If anyone else wants them,
they can buy them from me. Easy terms can be arranged.
