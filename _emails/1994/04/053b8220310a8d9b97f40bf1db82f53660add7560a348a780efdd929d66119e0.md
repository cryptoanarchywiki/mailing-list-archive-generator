OPEN SECRET
    Instead of using mathematical codes to scramble and unscramble
messages, Georgia Tech physicists are devising a way of sending a message
with electronic noise generated by a flickering laser. By connecting
identical lasers over fiber optics, the same random pattern of noise is
generated at both the sending and receiving end, and the receiving simply
subtracts the noise to uncover the message. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution
4/7/94 E2)
