   Our site is preparing to implement the PEM package from Trusted Information
 systems. The package is available to US/Canadian users from ftp.tis.com
 Any comments on this package would be appreciated. It appears to use a
 licensed version of RSAREF. But I just got the docs, so I can't say much
 else about it.
