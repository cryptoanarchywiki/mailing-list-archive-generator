Hopefully, someone will have this awful thing happen to them and sue the Shit
out of Safeway for being so negligent. Peter Mc Gowan, the asshole who owns
Safeway, sized down his employees [so his shareholders could make more
millions], . . . . .
These databases are already collecting information every time we do not pay
in cash. Those bar codes record everything. Safeway has taken this a bit
higher, and I only wish I had someone steal my checkbook and take Safeway to
the cleaners.
..............................................

Now that you know how negligent Safeway is and how their database is 
being used, you can choose an alternate place to shop for groceries, 
thus preserving your privacy as well as preventing  the support of 
their shareholders.
