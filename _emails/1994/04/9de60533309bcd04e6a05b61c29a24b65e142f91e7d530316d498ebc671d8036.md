This explanation struck me as phony.  No NSA employee would be so naive as
to actually believe that "Encryption on top of clipper is impossible 
since the clipper phone will only accept audio input" and clearly the NSA
had thought about how easy it would be to "splice a cryptdec".

Then it struck me what Clipper/LEAF really does, it provides plaintext
for a _chosen_ plaintext attack on other cryptosystems.  

Most of us tend to ignore chosen-plaintext attacks as being too impractical.
How would we ever be able to get the adversary to send lots of plaintext
of our (not his) chosing, we wonder.

Now suppose that No Such Agency is really years ahead of the rest of the
world in exploiting chosen plaintext to break all kinds of stuff, including
(say) DES.  They've unleashed DES upon the world, and now they're sort of
regretting it.  If only they could get us crypto-weenies ^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H
cypherpunks to send a few thousand choice pieces of chosen plaintext.
Hmmmm.  How could they do that?   

Final question:  Am I the last person on this list to have thought of this,
(namely, clipper as a chosen plaintext attack on other cryptosystems)?
