  Then the cops need to sting/watch these guys until they catch them
  committing these felonies and throw them in jail, not invade the
  privacy of a citizen cuz they think it's right.  If the cops were
  watching that neighborhood then the child couldn't have been sniped
  without the shooter getting bagged.  It is a poorly chosen solution to
  the police force's inability to do their job well due to fear and/or
  underfunding.

  Ah, but you see, you moved into the dorm (and signed a paper) saying you 
  would follow the school's rules.  These rules included uncool search and
  seizure and are allowed since you are not in a home... it's similar to a
  hotel's right to do room service when you're out at the pool.

  The people of CHA didn't forfeit the right to being secure in their homes.
  (Apartments count as a home) They moved in with no such waivers.  Therefore 
  they are afforded the same rights as a person with a house or living in an 
  apartment owned by, say you.  They may fall under tenant / landlord laws, 
  but they are very protective of the tenant.  EX:  Unless there is imminent 
  damage to the place (broken water pipe or such) then the landlord must give 
  2 days notice to do an inspection or pest control or whatever he thinks he 
  needs in there for.

  Take care
