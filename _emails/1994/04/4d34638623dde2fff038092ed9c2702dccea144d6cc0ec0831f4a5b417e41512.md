Then we have a difference of opinion.

I'm not going to try and convince a subborn fanatic, nor educate one on 
the operation and methods of intelligence agencies.  If you are not 
convinced that intelligence agencies create and use front companies, 
agents of influence in financial institutions, bribery, blind political 
support funds and transactions in general, you are not worth discussing 
the topic with until you read or do some intelligence work.

> also, i very sincerely doubt that money laundering is a major,
> minor, or even existing part of any u.s. intelligence services

I repeat the above.  Money laundering is essential to any intelligence 
operation, foreign based or U.S. based.  This is important not only to 
hide activities from the scrutiny of the public and hostile intelligence, 
but also to hide the source from the recipient.  Many political movements 
the U.S. would support, wouldn't be interested in the support if they 
knew it came from the U.S., or worse, U.S. intelligence.

Radio free America.
Radio free Europe (Set up by a "Private" company)
Radio Liberty.
U.S. Listening posts in Great Britain.
Cuban resistance movements.
The Schoenfeld tunnel.
Support for the American Federation of Labor
Support for anti-Communist American Students abroad in the 50's-60's.
Civil Air Transport (takeover)
Air America and the partner Southern Air Transport.
Airdale (the holding corp for the above)

How many do you want?

Asserting that U.S. intelligence does not and has no need of money 
laundering is silly.  Asserting that the NSA is never involved is also 
silly.  Regardless, your assertion that the NSA will become involved in 
the control of Federal Transactions because it will give government 
more control is flawed even by your own accepted factors.

> i reiterate my point: designing a secure digital cash system would be
> a key area that the nsa would be interested in.

This was not your point, your point was that the NSA would control such a 
system.  This point is also flawed.  The NSA may create the technical 
means, but logistics are not in the cards.

 in fact, i think it is

This is a point entirely separate from the above.
This is what the NSA does, it does not create institutions for public use.

Wrong.
Clipper is intended to maintain the COMINT/SIGINT ability domestically.  
This has nothing to do with finances and digital cash except in so far as 
the same hardware might be use to implement same BY PRIVATE ENTITIES.
This is of course assuming the private development of these systems is 
not sufficient, a premise which grows weaker by the day.

Intelligence would never risk overt control of domestic financial 
institutions that were not dedicated for use.  A silent involvement with 
a foreign bank through a front is much more efficient.

Where do you get this from?  The NSA is perhaps the most structured 
intelligence agency in the United States.  They certainly know their bounds 
better than the other collection arms, and I won't even mention the HUMINT
people.

It's easy to spout "virtually all analysts."  Want to tell us who and when?
As for historical precedent, when has the NSA come out public supporting 
a POLICY decision and not a technological development?  Clipper is not a 
grasp by intelligence, it is a utilization by executive authority of 
intelligence to support a centralist program.  If you cannot understand 
the distinction, you need to stay out of politics, and political analysis.

Which CPSR requests?  How is this an intelligence operation that impedes 
on domestic affairs?  I repeat the above, this is program from the 
EXECUTIVE branch.

Asserting that the FED had as much influence on retail financial 
transactions as you would have was your mistake.  Again, you make bald 
assertions that have no basis in fact, but merely seem to you to fit your 
argument, facts you already assume to be true and thus are convenient for 
you to adopt.  Try the reverse, come up with the facts first THEN move to 
the premise.

I'll leave it up to you to decide how the above differs from Clipper and 
the NSA's involvement.  Your failure to identify the distinction just adds 
to my assessment that you have no background in intelligence or financial 
institutions and thus have no business at all making this argument which 
requires no knowledge but in these two areas.

Ok, let's assume your correct, a dubious position.  I'll call this the 
"NIST" front theory.
In some ways it makes sense in that agencies are usually created as an 
insulator the to executive.

I don't doubt it.

Now let's go back to your "NIST" front theory.  If the policy is already 
in the open and attributed to NIST, why must the NSA be publically 
involved?  Surely the NIST front was created to mask involvement in some 
way yes?  If this is so, as your reading of the "several key agencies" 
clause seems to suggest, why is the NSA talking publicly?  Why is a NSA 
public relations official straight out of Q43 going to conferences?
How is the NIST front acting to insulate the President here?
A "ClusterFuck" even by your definition.
Mr. Sternlight, care to comment here?

Did you even read my message?

The NSA is being used here.  How can you reconcile the attitude and 
culture the NSA has with your insistence that the NSA must go public when 
even you admit a public front has already be established and the NSA 
need not be involved?  I think you forget what the last paragraph in your 
idea was before writing the next.

My whole point is that the NSA is being manipulated as a public relations 
tool and this is silly and betrays a total lack of intelligence 
experience by whoever is directing them.  Gee, I wonder, who's program is 
it now that the NSA is supporting?  Who might stand to gain from having 
that program succeed?  Who is probably then directing the NSA to support 
the program in public?  You really don't know anything about intelligence 
do you?

Patently obvious?  You only support it with your assumptions which I will 
now challenge, hardly obvious.

Clipper was an offshoot of the public key technology.  The effort on 
Clipper strings back to the Bush/Reagan era.  NSA is not a policy agency.
They came up with the technology because that's what they are paid to do.  
Applications for the technology are suggested, but it's up to other 
authority to apply it in practice.  It's called the take care clause.  
Suggesting that Clipper, including the policy decisions, is an NSA 
creation is ignorant.  The technology might be an NSA invention, or 
theft, the Clipper program is not.

You do babble don't you.

Your theory that the NSA seeks to control federal financial transactions 
and to develop a digital cash system to further that goal has nothing to 
do with the text on a bill.  You think the NSA established the ATM 
network outside of the DES derivative it may use?  That alone 
disqualifies you as an authority on the point.

I refuse to ponder your point because it implodes when touched.

You treat the intelligence agencies as a separate policy making arm of 
the government not as a tool of the executive.

"They" as in the NSA?
(Sigh)  Do you hear nothing?

The NSA may have suggested that certain technologies were going to loosen 
their grip on domestic COMINT/SIGINT.  How this makes the NSA a policy 
arm is beyond me, and I think even you.

I might add that limiting cryptography is hardly a goal mutually 
exclusive with secrecy.  You illuminated this yourself when you mentioned 
the "NIST" front theory.  The NSA does not HAVE to be involved here.  You 
have yet to show me otherwise.

You seem to have switched your position pretty quickly.  

Compare:

With:

      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is left to the reader to harmonize these two.

It leaves Clipper in trouble.  Never involve an intelligence agency in 
public affairs that might attract press and public opinion.  Silly.  Who 
might be responsible for this?  What a clod.

But I do have a great deal of respect for the Office of the Presidency.

Which is why, in part, that the publicity was a mistake.

 the

Wrong.

1)  Provide for government communications security.
2)  Provide and insure continued SIGINT/COMINT ability.

You mean, you would tell us that your going to argue this point, but then 
not support it.  These goals are not incompatible even if they were 
the goals of the NSA.
