>Wide-spread use of cryptography will greatly enhance our privacy, but

>Whether cryptography should be regulated at all is an important

>
>* Does Clipper Chip really make cryptography and law enforcement

>
>* Does Clipper Chip introduce unwanted and/or unforseen dangers?
> 
>* Are there better alternatives to making encryption and law
>  enforcement compatible, if this is what we want?
