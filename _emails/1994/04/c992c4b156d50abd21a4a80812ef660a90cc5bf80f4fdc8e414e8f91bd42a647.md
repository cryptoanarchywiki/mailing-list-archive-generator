A variation of the many "send bogus messages through the remailer"  
ideas...


The idea:

1) write sender-side code to split message into N parts and send each  
part through a different remailer chain.

2) decrypt the parts as they arrive as per normal encrypted remailer  
messages.

3) write receiver-side code to detect "a part" and stuff it in a file  
until the remaining related parts arrive.  When all related parts  
have arrived, present the complete message to receiver.


Why?  To increase the number of "messages" flowing through the  
remailers to make traffic analysis more difficult.

Comments welcome.
