Well, I did something similiar about 3 years ago with a friend.  But we
just laid a wire down on the street one evening, spread roofing tar over
it (the liquid sealant type) and let it dry overnight. :)  If your
street has had many patches/repairs over the years, it's unlikely a
casual observer would notice.  (Those that did notice ours thought it
was pretty creative...)

But anyway, on the radio circuit: Building a radio transceiver isn't too
difficult...but connecting it to your computer could be.  Probably the
easiest thing to do is get a simple analog transciever, and use a
error-correcting modem.  Unfortunately that wouldn't be much better than
doing it over the phone anyway...  But let me know how you're project
works out, I might be interested in doing something similiar.
