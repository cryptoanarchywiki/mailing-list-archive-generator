I have no interest in discussion with those who make strident claims
in reckless ignorance, who then expect other people to correct them,
and, worse yet, who finally insist on bickering over the accuracy of
anything one might say.

Use a library.  That's a place with lots of paper periodicals and
paper books.  Library materials not online, mostly, but it is still
where most of the world's encoded knowledge is stored.  If you don't
like paper, tough.  That's the way the world is right now.

If you like, I _will_ explain to you offline some resources available
in libraries about these topics, but only after I've seen some
evidence of a good faith effort to visit a library, such as, say, some
interesting story in a recent _American Banker_.

Eric
