Thought you might all like to know that that fool who posted the Green
Card Lottery thing to every known newsgroup has been busted for
disobeying netiquette. His server in, I think, Texas, has cancelled his
account! Check out the New York Times Business section of today, 4/19/94,
for a terrific article. It's great to see he got his just deserts.
Unfortunately, he seems perfectly happy and says as soon as he gets a new
account, he'll start advertising again! What can we do?

I got a kick out of this, especially considering the distribution.
