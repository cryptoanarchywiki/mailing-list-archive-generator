In the days when telcos used the SXS switching system, there was
significant cost in tracing a call - each channel had to be physically
seized and held - but now it's just a matter of pulling a tape or
punching up the info on a console.  Nevertheless, there are legal
obligations of confidentiality.  Interestingly, the police generally
have no problem seizing toll information on a subscriber, once the
warrant is obtained, because the subscriber needn't be informed - only
the telco, which has a vested interest in keeping the subscriber unaware
that his considentiality was violated.
