First, my main point was that the original poster's solution (i.e., "sue 
the shit out of Safeway") was sophomoric.  I don't see any basis for a 
cause of action.

Second, other than pay cash or--as someone else suggested--shop 
elsewhere, what are your options?  These solutions work.  Since Julie 
seems to think they are not enough, what would she suggest?  If one is 
concerned about centralizing power in the government, than that would 
seem to eliminate governmental solutions such as suing or sponsoring 
"privacy" laws, n'est-ce pas?
