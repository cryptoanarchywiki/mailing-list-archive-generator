Subject: a test server?
Message-ID: <m0pwFKv-000IDpC@crynwr>

Content-Type: text/plain


Is there a PGP test server anywhere?  I'd like to use its public key
to encrypt a message, mail it to the server, and have it mail the
plaintext back to me.  I'd also like to have it look up my pubic key
in the appropriate repository (which is?) and verify that my message
was signed properly.
