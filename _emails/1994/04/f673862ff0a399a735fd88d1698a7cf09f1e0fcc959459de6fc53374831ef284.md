SMALL CHANGE ON THE NET
        Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University are developing NetBill, a
computerized system for tracking and billing users for small transactions,
such as a ten-cent charge per document. The developers hope NetBill will
evolve into a universal accounting system on the Internet. (Chronicle of
Higher Education 4/20/93 A31)
