I found Timothy May's post on Hamiltonian cycles in graphs very in-
teresting. However, my main reason is due to the relevance between
this subject and the P - NP problem. Although I am familiar with
the practical aspect of this terminology (through my numerical
mathematics subjects), I am a bit hazy on the "pure", theoretical
side. Does anyone have any references on this matter. I am especially
interested in the "P=NP?" problem.

Thanks.
