I wrote a cryptographic scripting language that has been implemented in
a commercial product.  I hesitate to post it here due to its length.
If there is a place to send it where it can be archived for public
down-load, I could do that.  I am in the process of writing it up for
a symposium, but have other things that I would rather do.  If I could
modify it to improve it's integration w/ telescript, I would like to
do it, but I don't have telescript, does anyone here have it?

Peace
