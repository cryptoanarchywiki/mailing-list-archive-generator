Applied Cryptography could easily be renamed 'the cypherpunk's bible' in 
my opinion. It cost me about US$50, and it was definatly worth it. What 
makes it valuable is that it's focus is on the implimentation of crypto, 
not just the big math. It deals extensively with the different protocalls 
as well as all the major algorithims. I recomend it highly.

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
