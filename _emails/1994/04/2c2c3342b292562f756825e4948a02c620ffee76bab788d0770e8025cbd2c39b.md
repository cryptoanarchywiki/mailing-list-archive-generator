It gets even trickier.  Roulette in the U.S. has even worse odds than in
Europe because of addition of 00 (another number that causes all the
even/odd, red/black, etc bets to lose)  The closest one comes to an even
money bet in a casino is betting "No Pass" in craps, and constantly betting
No Pass will make you somewhat unpopular at the table...
