This was mentioned in the press a while back; it's not intended for everyone,
but frequent travellers, including US subjects and non-US-subjects,
would be able to get them to speed going through the border police.
Don't know implementation timeframe, and as Lyle said,
they weren't real explicit about what they planned to do with the
data they collect.  Paper passports and border police are already offensive;
I've got no plans to get more people-control technology applied to me.
