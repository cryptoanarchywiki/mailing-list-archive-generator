What's probably happened is that someone has forged a subscription to
a mailing list or two in your name.  This is a fairly common net prank.
Who have you annoyed recently?

PS The chances of catching the person from the mailer logs of the
various lists you have been subscribed to is small but it's worth
asking the people in charge if the original subscription request
can still be found.  Often there will be clues in the header as
to where the forgery came from.
