In Ohio, you are supposed to file a Ficticious Name form for $15 or
so, but I was in business for years before I even knew about it.  I
don't know if it's practically required or not.

Businesses using an assumed name are supposed to be noted in certain
places as "so and so dba FRED's USED STUFF"
