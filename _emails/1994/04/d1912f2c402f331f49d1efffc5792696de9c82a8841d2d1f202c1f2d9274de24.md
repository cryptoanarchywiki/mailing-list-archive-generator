Dear Colleagues;

An overview of TEMPEST can be found in DCA Circular 300-95-1, available 
from your nearest Federal Documents Depository / Government Library. The 
section of interest in is Volume 2, DCS Site and Building Information, 
sections SB4 & SB5, (Grounding,Shielding,HEMP). SB5 though not directly 
covering RFI/RF Emanation is devoted to shielding for high altitude 
electromagnetic pulse radiation (HEMP). The documents discuss Earth 
Electrode Systems, Fault Protection Systems, Lightning Protection Systems,
Signal Reference Systems, and RFI containment, they also briefly 
discusses radio signal containment (TEMPEST) as well. This is a must-read 
for anyone wishing to keep their bits to themselves. Discussions of
testing and validation methods are not discussed in the unclassified 
documents. I have included the references to the Secret/Classified
documents for the sake of completeness. It is possible that some of
them are by now de-classified, or may be requested through FOIA.


Several other U.S. Federal documents are of interest:

  MIL-STD-188-124, "Grounding, Bonding, and Shielding for Common Long 
Haul/Tactical Communication Systems", U.S. Dept. of Defense, June 14, 
1978.

  MIL-HDBK-419, "Grounding, Bonding, and Shielding for Electronic 
Equipments and Facilities", U.S. Dept. of Defense, July 1, 1981.

  "Design Practices for High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) 
Protection", Defense Communications Agency, June 1981.

  "Systems Engineering Specification 77-4, 1842 EEG SES 77-4", Air Force 
Communications Command, January 1980.

  "EMP Engineering Practices Handbook", NATO File No. 1460-2, October 1977

  "Tempest Fundamentals", NSA-82-89, NACSIM 5000, National Security 
Agency, February 1, 1982 (Classified).

  "Guidelines for Facility Design and RED/BLACK Installation, NSA-82-90, 
NACSIM 5203, National Security Agency, June 30, 1982 (Classified).

  "Physical Security Standards for Sensitive Compartmented Information 
Facilities (SCIF), Manual No. 50-3 Defense Intelligence Agency (For 
Official Use Only), May 2, 1980.

  "Tempest Countermeasures for Facilities Within the United States", 
National COMSEC Instruction, NACSI 5004, January 1984 (Secret).

  "Tempest Countermeasures for Facilities Outside the United States", 
National COMSEC Instruction, NACSI 5005, January 1985 (Secret).

  "Ground-based Systems EMP Design Handbook", AFWL-NTYCC-TN-82-2, Air 
Force Weapons Laboratory, February 1982.

  "R.F. Shielded Enclosures for Communications Equipment: General 
Specification", Specification NSA No. 65-6, National Security Agency 
Specificaton, October 30, 1964.
