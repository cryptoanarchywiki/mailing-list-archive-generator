You're a little slow, Sparky.  I had the <ask@eff.org> sig! on my public
key a couple of days before it hit the net.  One may ftp it, or simply
email pgpkey@eff.org-  It's for sensitive messages and comes with a 
request that it not be used trivially.  It's been out for a few weeks now. 
I used it 5 April to encrypt my Fed Reserve report to the office.

With Dan Brown for a SysOp and average loads tantilizingly low on eff.org,
why do they need the hassle of signing their messages?  Site security is
a site responsibility.  The Hoax came out of an anonymous remailer, not
an eff.org forgery.  The Hoax enjoyed a brief resurgence on the net a week
ago and was pandemically debunked as soon as it showed up.
