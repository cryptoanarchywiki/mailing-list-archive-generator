You realize, of course, that by posting the manual verbatim you have allowed 
them to discover where the leak was.  They have the ability to change the 
wording slightly on every document, so that when you quote the document they 
can discover who gave it to you.  That is why newspapers no longer report 
quotes from documents that they have, or never show pictures of secret 
documents.  Then again, for something as simple as a manual, they may not 
bother to change each one.  But the capability exists.
