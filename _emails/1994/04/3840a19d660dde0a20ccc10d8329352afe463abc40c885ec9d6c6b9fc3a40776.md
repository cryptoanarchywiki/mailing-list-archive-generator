	I guess I have been too immersed in surveillance theory lately
- I'm begining to get a bit paranoid! However, I do sometimes wonder if
some of the new technologies (such as "interactive TV") which will be be
brought into the homes of the populus could in fact be used for more
insidious purposes than was the original intent (I am generously assuming
the original intent was as it was presented to the consumer).
I mean- what's to stop the government- or perhaps the big capitalists-
from utilizing the technologies, such as that suggested by the Neilson
people, to monitor citizens *not* part of some voluntary rating program. 
Are you suggesting that since Denning et al aren't "argueing for it"
that it is inconceivable? Hmm....
