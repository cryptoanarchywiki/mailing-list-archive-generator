This is something I have been  meaning  to  write  to the list
for  several  weeks,  and  this  post  is the perfect lead in.
When  I  joined  this  list,  I saw thought it was going to be
much different.  I had  assumed   1)  that people on this list
would  have  much different politics and 2) that that wouldn't
really  matter,  'cause  everyone here is  concerned with  one
issue, which we could all agree on. 2) seems to have partially
true, sometimes.

Without expounding  at lengths, my reaction was to unsubscribe
on short order  when I saw some  of  the  first  posts  flying
around. I didn't,  because  I  try to keep an open mind and do
change opinions sometimes. But not everyone who is a potential
crypto  supporter is  gonna bother, and by tying (seemingly or
not- impressions count  here) the issue to a particular set of
other beliefs, there is a huge  chance  that  others are going
to be alienated.  I know *I* don't want  to be associated with
libertarianism or (even worse) Perot...

The point is that  even if you  think anyone  with a viewpoint
opposing yours is automatically stupid and not worth your time
(and I don't think  that  too many of you are that bad off ;),
aren't they at least  worth  using  to  further  something you
believe strongly in? It  might  do  well  to  be   careful  in 
alienating   potential  allys  by  flip  political  jokes  and
comments.
