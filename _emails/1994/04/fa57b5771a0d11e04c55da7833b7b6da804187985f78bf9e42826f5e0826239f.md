I didn't add to that thread.

I did write several long articles about crypto, objects, toolkits,
etc., but I guess stuff like this is outside the current charter of
Cypherpunks, as there has been little comment on my proposals today
(I'm reading my mail sequentially, and mostly I've seen stuff about
guns, Oldsmobiles, inner cities, warrantless searches, housing
projects, ASCII codes ("Hey, _codes_ man!"), and nothing on the
threads on crypto toolkits. Oh well.)
