                          THE WHITE HOUSE
                   Office of the Vice President
   ____________________________________________________________
   For Immediate Release			April 20, 1994
   
   
    GORE JOINS BENTSEN, RENO IN CRIME TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION
         Vice President Announces Inter-Agency Agreements
   
        WASHINGTON -- To illustrate how the use of technology 
   can help fight rising crime, Vice President Al Gore today 
   (4/20) joined Administration officials in a demonstration of 
   wireless and dual-use technologies that can be used for law 
   enforcement purposes.  He also announced two inter-agency 
   agreements that will increase cooperation between the 
   Departments of Justice, Treasury, and Defense in using 
   technology to help combat crime.
   
   	"The technologies demonstrated today provide powerful 
   new weapons in the war against crime," the Vice President 
   said.  "Technological advances make it possible to fight 
   crime safer and smarter than ever before.  They increase 
   safety, enhance productivity for our law enforcement 
   officials, and save taxpayer dollars."
   
   	The Vice President joined Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
   Bensten, Attorney General Janet Reno, Deputy Secretary of 
   Defense John Deutch, and Office of National Drug Control 
   Policy Director Lee Brown in the demonstration, which 
   included a wide variety of technologies that will help fight 
   crime or support law enforcement.
   
   	In addition, the Vice President announced two inter-
   agency Memorandums of Understandings.  The first MOU, 
   between the Departments of Justice and Treasury, establishes 
   an agreement to develop a wireless telecommunications 
   network for use by federal, state, and local law enforcement 
   officials.  This agreement implements one of the 
   recommendations of Vice President Gore's National 
   Performance Review to make the federal government work 
   better and cost less.  The second MOU, between the 
   Departments of Defense and Justice, is a five-year agreement 
   to jointly develop and share technologies that are necessary 
   for both law enforcement and military operations other than 
   war. 
   	
   	Secretary Bentsen said, "We want to invest in crime-
   fighting technology, we want to do it so local and state 
   police benefit, and we want to do it so costs don't go 
   through the roof.  That's why I'm so eager to sign up 
   Treasury in a partnership with Justice to develop cost-
   effective and efficient technology."
   
   	"New technologies increase the effectiveness of law 
   enforcement, offer police officers greater options for 
   apprehension, and improve the safety of the public," said 
   Attorney General Reno.  "Today's agreements will unite the 
   efforts of the Justice Department with those of Defense and 
   Treasury to help make these technologies available to our 
   nation's law enforcement community."
                                 
   	Deputy Secretary Deutch said, "Today's Memorandum of 
   Understanding formalizes our ongoing relationship with the 
   Department of Justice.  It comes at a time when budgets are 
   decreasing and yet we need different capabilities and 
   equipment to accomplish our peacekeeping and humanitarian 
   missions.  We are finding that these requirements are 
   similar in many cases to the needs of law enforcement 
   agencies, and we look forward to cooperating in this area."
   
   	The demonstrations included an automated booking system 
   to electronically record fingerprints and mug shots, laser-
   assisted computer imaging equipment for examining 
   ballistics, and a portable/hand-held/single-step device to 
   retrieve more readable fingerprints at crime scenes.  They 
   also viewed technology that provides police cars with 
   mainframe database information such as criminal records and 
   traffic violations, and allows them to file reports from 
   their cars.  Several non-lethal weapons for use in pursuit 
   of a suspect or while a suspect is in custody also were 
   displayed.
