I think we should be careful here. Yes, the big companies are getting
smaller, but that doesn't mean that we're not seeing centralization.
You might argue the exact opposite: The economy is becoming _increasingly_
centralized and the computers and automation are allowing the large
companies to cut out even more people. 

Consider some facts. Microsoft and Intel dominate the microcomputer market.
The auto market in the US expanded over the last several years because
more imports started arriving, but now the global auto capacity is
really much too large. That's why Jaguar, Lotus and many of the other
brands are now just divisions of the large companies. This will continue
to happen as the auto companies merge and cross purchase shares. 
In the airplane market, Boeing is considering pooling resources with
one of its two major competitors, Airbus, so the two can design the
next big plane. 

Yes, there are many small, new companies, but I think this is largely
because of other considerations. It is much cheaper for companies to hire
contractors than employees. The high cost of benefits makes it easier
to shed the people and make them fend for themselves. Plus, the affirmative
action and other discrimination laws makes it difficult if not impossible
to fire anyone but a young, straight, white man without worrying about
a discrimination suit. These are the principle reasons why the corporations
don't have many employees.
