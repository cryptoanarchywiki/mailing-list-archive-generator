I just finished watching--and videotaping--the 11.5 minute report by
Philip Elmer-Dewitt on Clipper and related topics.

The MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour should be in your area several more times
today...around the dinner period, later, etc. Here in Bay Area, it
comes on at 5, at 6, and as late as 10 and 11. "Check your local
listings."

An even-handed report, with brief statements from Marc Rotenberg, Lynn
McNulty, Dave Banisar, Dorothy Denning, Whit Diffie, Jerry Berman, and
a Dept. of Justice guy.

"A bad idea" vs. ""Folly to let intercept capabilities be lost."

Some nice aerial shots of Fort Meade, NSA. A demo of AT&T's
SecurePhone 3600. A brief explanation of Clipper.

I won't type in the quotes from the folks above. See the report for
yourself. No major surprises.

Except perhaps Marc Rotenberg's clear statement that after Clipper and
Digital Telephony will come "restrictions on noncomplying
cryptography." (Surprising in that it's a bold prediction. One we all
have suspected is the case, but a public statement--which the report
did not have a refutation of--all the same.)

Tim-Bob says "Check it out!"
