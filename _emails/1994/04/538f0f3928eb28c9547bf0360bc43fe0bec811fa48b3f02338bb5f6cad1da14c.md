And Mr. Davis made that implication out of complete ignorance.  I am not
an acadamian.  I am semi-retired, and was quitely living out my life in
Wyoming until John Perry Barlow declared revolutionary war in cyberspace.
Now I'm hanging out with Math PhD's and hardware engineers marveling at 
the acceleration of my learning curve.

Thank you sincerly for the education, Perry.  I appologize for my ignorance
leading me to be dishonest.  Standing corrected, I will be honest about
meeting Milgram during a presentation on ethics in human experimentation.
In respect to the inevitability of future stupidity on my part, I will
immediately post a public admission of my error as I did now.  r.
