Subject: Clipper Day on the Hill

Due to the Memorial Day in honor of Ex President Nixon, the Senate Hearing
has been resheduled.

Sen Leahy's hearing which had been scheduled for this Wed has been moved to
May 3 at 0930 in room 216 at the Hart Senate office building.

and Represenative Valentines House hearing will be May 3 in Room 2318 in
the Rayburn Building at 1:00 pm.

Non stop Clipper, Digital Telephony. A cast of millions (well maybe 15).

Dave

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
