Is what you are saying, Mr. Davidson, that "Prof. Cipher Deavours" is
sufficient critical examination?

This argument boils down to "well, we had this one group look and it
and they couldn't break it, therefore, it is secure."

This is not Eric Hughes.

What did I misunderstand about the statistical test?  I read about a
weak system versus a 2000 byte file, and Dolphin Encrypt versus a
60000 byte file.  No description of what the files were was evident.

If the authors have such high cryptographic skills, then perhaps they
can show the results of differential cryptanalysis (or linear
cryptanalysis, etc.) on Dolphin Encrypt, rather than some completely
bogus statistical test like the one displayed.
