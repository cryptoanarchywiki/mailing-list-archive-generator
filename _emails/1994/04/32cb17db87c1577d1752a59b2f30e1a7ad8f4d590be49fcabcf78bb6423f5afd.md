Yes.  Should I be subject to the 'tyranny of the masses' as deToqueville
put it?  Conventional wisdom would say 'yes' however, I disagree. 
Conventional wisdom also suggests that I have a choice to live here or
not.  For many people living in subsidized housing, there is no choice,
but rather, the choice is between there and the street.  You said that if
you had a choice, fine, but for most if not all of these people, there is
NO choice.  They cannot choose a building, they simply take what is givne
to them.  Such are the breaks of being poor.

Also there exists another problem with it.  Why should I give up my gun
which I use to protect my family when its not even illegal except in
places where the the government is the landlord, that is mostly poorer
sections of town.

Ben.
