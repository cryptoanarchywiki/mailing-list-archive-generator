SOME DEFINITIONS

   In the U.S. it is almost impossible to talk sensibly about politics
since no one knows the definitions of political orientations. For
instance: what is a conservative? Someone who resists change; someone
who wants the old order. Conservative is a relative term & does not
make sense without reference to time & place. In the U.S. a conservative
would be vaguely a right wing statist. In Russia a conservative would
be a Stalinist. Also take liberal: In the old days in the U.S., liberal
meant libertarian. In Europe now, liberal means roughly libertarian.
In modern U.S., liberal means left wing statist.

   So what is left & right? The dictionary is useless for this question.
But, I think I have figured it out. Left & right is based on EQUALITY
OF OUTCOME AMONG PEOPLE BY RULES. A left winger insists on rules that
will insure equality of outcome & resists rules that might yield
inequality. A right winger opposes rules that coerce equality of
outcome & may favor rules that coerce inequality of outcome.

   In the modern U.S., the political majority is made up of
right wing statists (fascists/conservatives/republicans) & left wing
statists (socialists/liberals/democrates).

   There does not seem to be any name for left wing
minarchists /or anarchists or right wing minarchists /or anarchists.
This list seems to have a lot of left & right wing
minarchists & anarchists. I am a right wing anarchist.

   Strange that right wing & left wing are not bluntly defined. A taboo
maybe or doesn't the ruling class want the political discussions to
make any sense? Maybe if it were made explicit, then the left & right
would think they could be left & right & yet, not support the state.


                                     PUSH EM BACK! PUSH EM BACK!
                                     WWAAAYYYY  BBAAACCCKKKK!
                                     BEAT STATE!!!!
                                     yours truly,
                                     Gary Jeffers
