	I have figure out a way to distribute MacPGP on AOL.  I uploaded a listing of where to get MacPGP and in the file description I said that I would e-mail
individuals that wanted MacPGP but didn't have Internet access, along with sprea
ding the word around.  I will only have to mail it originally to myself and then
forward it to others as they request it.  Any comments or suggestions are welcome.
