Take a look in International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)
(22 CFR 120-130), Department of State, Office of Munitions Control,
November, 1989.  See Part 121 - The United States Munitions List, 
Category XIII - Auxiliary Military Equipment, paragraph (b), quoted as
follows:

	(b) Speech scramblers, privacy devices,
cryptographic devices and software (encoding and
decoding), and components specifically designed
or modified therefore, ancillary equipment, and
protective apparatus specifically designed or modi-
fied for such devices, components, and equip-
ment.

Regards,

Dave
