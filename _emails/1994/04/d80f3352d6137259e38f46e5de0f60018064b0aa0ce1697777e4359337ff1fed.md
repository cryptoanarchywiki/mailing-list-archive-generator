It seems to me the obvious solution to this problem, is for someone (with 
the means & incentive) to set up remailers in countries outside the 
jurisdictions of the US (and other countries with similar copyright laws) 
that simply REFUSE to track points or origin.  Yes, the remailer has to 
be capable of determining point of origin in order to be able to 
function, but by no means must it be set up to do so.  The world is a big 
place, and don't think it would be too dificult to find a place where the 
local authorities would have no interest in enforcing US copyright laws. 
Or maybe we can talk Bill Gates into installing a T1 to antarctica ;-)
