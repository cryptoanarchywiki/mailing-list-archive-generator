Anyone interested in liberty or politics should have read "Obedience to
Authority" in which the results of this experiment are reported for
popular consumption.
************
Helps you understand "how they could do that" when confronted with
atrocities.
..............................................

Q:  In this book, does it say whether the test subjects were asked 
about their thoughts on this?   Did they provide an explanation, from 
their own point of view, for their obedience or what they understood 
about the objective of the experiment - before & after?
