Why is this scary?  It was just about police getting better methods of
communicating with each other, as far as I could tell.  I am not against
the idea of police in general, just abuses of government power.

How is the concept of police being better able to get fingerprints at the
crime scene scary?  If you break into my house, I'd like the police
to be able to get your fingerprints.

The police are a Good Thing when they are protecting me from fraud, theft,
and physical attack.
