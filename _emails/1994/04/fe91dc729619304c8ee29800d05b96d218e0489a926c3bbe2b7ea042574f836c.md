Safeway food stores has this neat little glitch in their shopping database
that is just ripe for abuse and litigation. When you pay by check, your
information is recorded and stored in their computers, so the next time you
go in there and try to get out your ID [for your check], they say "Don't
bother, we have that information."

So if Joe bad guy gets ahold of your checkbook, writes a bunch of checks,
let's say, over a weekend, Safeway doesn't care because the computer sez your
account is Kosher.

Hopefully, someone will have this awful thing happen to them and sue the Shit
out of Safeway for being so negligent. Peter Mc Gowan, the asshole who owns
Safeway, sized down his employees [so his shareholders could make more
millions], which means we have to wait in even longer lines, due to his
excellent insight into the Food Management.

These databases are already collecting information every time we do not pay
in cash. Those bar codes record everything. Safeway has taken this a bit
higher, and I only wish I had someone steal my checkbook and take Safeway to
the cleaners.
