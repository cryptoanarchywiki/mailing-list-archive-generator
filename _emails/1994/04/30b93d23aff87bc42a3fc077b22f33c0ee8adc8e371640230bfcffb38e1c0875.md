Fellow 'punks -

This comes from the National Journal and it sure as hell ain't an April
Fools Day joke.  Read the last line carefully!

-----No. 5 of 40------------------------
04/02/94 -- (C) 1994 National Journal (LEGI-SLATE Article No. 201346)
 
 
               Inside Washington - Here's a Real Weighty Matter
                              "National Journal"
                           Saturday, April 2, 1994
                                   Page 759
 
           Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., used the recent death of Senate
gym attendant Troy Brown as an opportunity to discuss his own much-noted
waistline problems. Brown, Kennedy told his colleages in late March, helped
him monitor his tendency "to gain a few pounds on occasion." While reassuring
the Senator that it had been OK to graze on eggs Benedict that morning, Brown
discreetly recorded Kennedy's weight in the back of the gym book so that no
other Senator could see them. "I knew he was on my side," Kennedy added, "when
he volunteered to keep my numbers in code."
