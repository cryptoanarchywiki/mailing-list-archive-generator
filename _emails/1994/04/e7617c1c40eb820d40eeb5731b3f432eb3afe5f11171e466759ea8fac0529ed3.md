These kind of meetings (DC 2600 meeting at Pentagon City Mall, 1st Fri. of
every month in the food court, about 5-7pm or so) might be good places for
local cypherpunks gatherings as well.  I'm sure there are a lot of other
such meetings, but the DC and Baltimore ones are the ones I know of.

phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
