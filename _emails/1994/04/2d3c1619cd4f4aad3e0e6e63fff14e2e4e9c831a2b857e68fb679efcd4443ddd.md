Perhaps this is only reflective of the Real World, where he who gets
to the scarce resources first wins. Either you put a cap on the total
resource (meaning some must starve, unless they can trade something
else of worth), or you must allow limitless expansion.

You could impose an annoyance factor on the distribution of initial
resources (a week's wait, perhaps), or on unlikely transfers (you
can't give away the resource except in exchange for some other form of
goods... an Objectivist's paradise, perhaps?)

Finally, there's always forced socialism: A high tax rate or inflation
rate should keep folks from accumulating ill-gotten wealth for long.

Without delving too deeply into the details of the simulation, isn't
the liquidity of the value of the resource a hedge against people
attempting to stockpile same through polynymity?
