Well, it was quoted from memory, so it's possible that I made an error,
but it seems to work as stated...

For example :

(4!+1)^(1/2)=5
(5!+1)^(1/2)=11
(7!+1)^(1/2)=71

I can't find a value which produces a result that is a non-prime
integer.  (Of course that doesn't prove that there isn't one.)
