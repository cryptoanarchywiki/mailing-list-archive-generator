To clarify who uses this label:  (Sorry to reply again in this venue.)
(In the two years on/off this list, this is the first offsubject...)

The members of the FFRF (Freedom From Religion Foundation), which
exists mainly, IMHO, as a support group for those who feel oppressed
in some way or who want to counteract the spreading tendancies of
religion.  The members tend to like the label 'Freethinker' for
themselves and have pins as such.  The group is made up of atheists
(strong & weak), agnostics, 'non-practicing Jews', PFLAG members (a
group that falls under the religiously persecuited label), and
church/state separatists (many of which may be somewhat religious).

If you want to find a comprehensive news reporting of priest
transgressions, for instance, their newsletter gathers info from all
over the US.

Yea, I'm a FreeThinker.  I find it impossible to believe in religion.
Even when I wanted to, I just couldn't.

I have a sound, rational view of life, morals, and goals.  I'm happy.
