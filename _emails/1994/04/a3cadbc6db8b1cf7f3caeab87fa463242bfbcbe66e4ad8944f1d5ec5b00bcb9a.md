I yield... I was overly sensitive to anything that might be
construed to be continuing the idea that the Internet is mostly Gov.
funded...  I should have known that you knew better.  (I'll plead
cronic exhaustion: 15 hour days for the last week to finish a
project...  slippery fingers deleted 1500/5MB worth of email last
night...  One way to catch up.)

I agree with your point.
