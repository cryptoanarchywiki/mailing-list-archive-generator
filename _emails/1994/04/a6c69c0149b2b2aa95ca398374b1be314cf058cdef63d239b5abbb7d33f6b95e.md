Cheer up, NetSurfer, as nobody takes anonymous accusations too
seriously...at least not anyboy with any common sense.

Reputations matter, and anonymous entities who provide no verifiable
info (not that many of us want to see such info, or would bother to
investigate it) have almost zero reputation. The calculus of
reputations thus means that anonymous accusations carry little weight.

There's a lot more to be said here. This issue lies close to the heart
of how crypto anarchy works.
