I'd had the same musing myself, except with geosynch.
Get the thing to generate its key once it's launched,
and send down the public half.  There's no way it
could by physically compromized.  NASA's shuttle
can't get that high.  I doubt the soviet shuttle could
either.  The only thing 'they' could do would be to
destroy or jam it.

When you say "Wouldn't cost _that_ much", I'd hazard
it's still out of the reach off all but big corporations.
