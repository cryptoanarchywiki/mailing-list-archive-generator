VCII and VCII+ both use DES. VC/RS uses a plug-in card; right now the
RS cards are all still DES. An interesting note is that the VC family
uses digital sound and encrypts it. You can allegedly reconstruct the
vertical sync signal and get watchable pictures, but for sound you
either need to break DES or exploit a system vulnerability.

All of the above are presently VCII+ customers.

There were several such design and implementation vulnerabilities in
the VCII system, and they were quickly exploited by pirates. As a
counter, GI introduced the VCII+, which has fewer vulnerabilities and
has not yet (AFAIK) been "broken". (n.b. I know that the use of
"wizard codes", or master keys, still continues, but I don't really
count that as a break.)

Part of the reason behind the conversion is necessity. Programmers
were downlinking both VCII and VCII+ authorization datastreams for a
while. When VC/RS became available, some programmers switched over to
downlinking VCII+ and VC/RS. When the VCII+ datastreams go dark, VCII+
descramblers won't work.

GI has been very, very tightlipped about any of the compression or
encryption technology behind DigiCipher.
