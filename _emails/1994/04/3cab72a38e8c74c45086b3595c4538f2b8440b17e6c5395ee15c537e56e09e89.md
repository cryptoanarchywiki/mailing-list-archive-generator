  That'll happen with the book'o'barcodes too, and you can't
  use an anonymous remailer for that.

I believe that's the question under discussion -- whether or not
a book'o'barcodes would pass under the ITAR regulations.  Given
that the book itself passes (has already passed), what changes
would need to be made so that the book could still be exported but
be much easier to enter into a machine than having to retype the
whole thing.
