I had this thought earlier today:  What if the infamous "THEY" want
to track your actions.  They have reason to believe you live in Chicago 
and just bought a gun to take back home.  This being illegal they would
like to nail you.  You, however, have read this list and are a bit on
the "shady" side of the law and bought the gun with cash and a fake 
name/id.  Safe at last, or are you?  What if "they" analyzed all the
ATM machines in that general area and got a report of everyone who 
withdrew Gun_Price + 0-to-100 dollars. (Spending money).  They could
narrow it down and eventually, since they suspect you anyway, get your
pix from the ATM video camera.  Take this to the gun man and you're id'd.

My point?  Does everyone do what I do... carry little cash and when you
want to buy something with cash go to a machine and take it out within an
hour of your purchase?  It seems to me if this is typical then we need to
look at changing that habit since it can lead someone to you, albeit with
great difficulty.
