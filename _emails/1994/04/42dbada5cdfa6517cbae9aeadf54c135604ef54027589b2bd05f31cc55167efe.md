   Good idea. The remailer assumes a few things. 1) if you don't
give an explicit chaining path, and chaining is turned on, the
remailer automatically picks the remailers with the heaviest usage for
chaining. 2) if you give an explicit path, do not override it unless a 
remailer in the path doesn't respond

   A better idea might be a sort of "domain remailer naming service"
which locates users on a remailer network (instead of explicitly
giving out the remailer that your virtual address is located on) This
DrNS would have to be trusted and secure, but it does cut down the
number of trust entities since you only have it to trust, not every
remailer on the network which has a copy of where your virtual address
is located. Julf's APS is sorta like this already.

   I like the decentralized approach best. Let's say you don't want
any plaintext associated with your real e-mail address. Simply
set up two virtual addresses as follows:

Remailer1: foo -> rjc@gnu.ai.mit.edu
Remailer2: AnonymousRay -> foo#remailer1

  Now when a plaintext arrives at remailer2, it is encrypted for
remailer1, and with *your* public key (associated with "AnonymousRay")
if one is present.

  So one remailer sees (plaintext, foo#remailer1), the other one
sees (ciphertext, rjc@gnu.ai.mit.edu), but neither sees
(plaintext, rjc@gnu.ai.mit.edu) Of course, collaboration is a problem,
but you can always increase the chain length to take care of that.

  You can include SASE standard cypherpunk remailer blocks too if you
want to further confuse the issue.

  Ah, I didn't explain this. Originally, I planned to implement some
remailer network level commands such as "add/change my stats in your
list of remailers", "put a link to this virtual user in your networking
map", "change my public key", etc. To do this, I assumed that
only *trusted* remailers would be added to your remailer network list so 
that only trusted entities could do network level commands (by signing
them) and only trusted remailers could introduce other remailers to the
network. Now I think I'll require the operator to do this stuff manually
so if you change the parameters of your remailer, you have to manually
notify others on the network and they have to update the configuration
files manually.

  Encrypting messages between remailers is useful because you want
to make sure there is no correlation between incoming requests and
outgoing ciphertexts. You not only want to encrypt them, you want to
alter the sizes of them. I didn't think it was wise to pad a
1,000 byte message out to a 100,000 byte message if both were in the
"mix" Instead, I opted to "packetize" the messages and quantize the
packet lengths to an operator configurable length. Each packet is
encrypted separately and I'm investigating the feasibility of
sending them through separate chains. The problem is, all the pieces
must end up at some remailer where they are reassembled. This
situation would be alleviated if there was a standardized remailer
client operating on the receiving/user side. Even cooler, a 
telescript/postscript like language for splicing and dicing incoming
mail streams. Sort of a PGP/Mail scripting language that can't do any damage
executing scripts embedded in incoming mail.

   It was an easier implementation issue for me to just handle
commands in the body vs. header and body. Putting commands in
unencrypted headers seems to be a bad idea (especially if you are
giving the remailer an explicit chain. You want to defeat traffic
analysis, not help it)

   This works already. The remailer is written such that it doesn't
care whether the data is coming from a sendmail STDIN stream, or a
socket. All it does is redirect the socket to STDIN once the
"DATA" command is given. Then, the same routine which processes the
mail side of the server works on the socket data.

   The socket-mode is pretty much a 'free' feature (didn't take
any special logic in the command processor). The software
can run without it, but it works better for internet users.

  Karl Barrus suggested that I use the usenet style FIFO format as in,
remailer1#remailer2#remailer3#user (like foo!bar!user) I'm not sure
which is more intuitive, but I would like some feedback on this.
I agree that one must trust a remailer operator, but I think there's
already too much trust in the single non-networked remailer currently used.
(operator logging easily catches any anonymity)

  I agree completely. This is always the danger which is why I think
remailers should have ratings, flags, and comments in the list of
remailers, and that remailer operators should only include those
that they trust. I also feel that virtual addresses should always be
many levels deep. (user -> foo#remailer1 -> bar#remailer2 -> 
baz#remailer3 which is an encrypted Eric Hughes style cypherpunk
remailer block.  The only problem is that since Eric's software isn't
part of the notification net, the software has no idea whether the
remailer is up and running or not)

  Some security through obscurity will be needed.

  Thanks. I still have a lot of work to do on it. I got side tracked
for the last two weeks and my undertaking was a little too ambituous.
When I announced it, most of the library I/O functions were done, but
the major network logic still needs to be written. It should be beta testing
in the next few weeks. Make any requests/suggestions now. ;-)

  Thanks for the comments,
