I have an appointment with my State Senator Friday to talk to him about 
telnet access from basic phone service becoming a State Right of residents.
................................................

How do you have time to keep up with the list, what with talking to 
reporters from ABC & other media, consorting with Senators, changing 
the educational style of your public school systems, and 
single-handedly revitalizing the economy while changing the industry to 
a technological base in a state with limited water resources?  And all 
this form Wyoming!

Also, with the infusion of a centralized industry and the establishment 
of basic phone rights, how would you maintain your position as one of 
Barlow's revolutionary compadres?

(Just wondering.)
