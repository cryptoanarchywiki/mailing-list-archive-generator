This argument doesn't work to well.  PGP is available in full source code 
form.  It's hard to build a backdoor in the code and distribute it widely 
without expecting your glitch to be noticed.  PGP has been studied over 
and over by careful prying eyes.  Even though you probably aren't a 
programmer yourself, it might do you a bit of good to download the source 
and look at it yourself.
