For some reason I have not been able to get any of the remailers to
work with PGP encryption.

In addition, the ping figures at the end of the soda finger file
don't seem to have changed since I first looked at them some
days ago.... is this just me?

Is anyone out there chaining with PGP supporting remailers?

Could ya drop me a line, preferably with some reply option, and
give me a few hints?

[sigh]
