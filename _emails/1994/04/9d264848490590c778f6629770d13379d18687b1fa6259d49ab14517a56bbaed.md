I once read a story in the newspaper about a popular mayor who, it was
reported, died in a massage parlor.  I didn't realize that it was a
prank for some time.  I felt sheepish.  Should we monitor newspapers?
I don't think so.

Healthy skepticism of random messages on the net is a better way to
solve this problem.  Is this really Stewart Brand?
