In a closed system such as the one you describe, the problems of
free and easy access to nyms is not a concern.  My read is that
the only time this is in a problem in the way we are approach it 
is in a less private forum.  Mr. Sternlight will be the first to
mention that you need not participate in such a forum.  I will be
the first to advise you actively not to.  (See below)

Your sentence leaves ambiguous what subject the "worst kind of bad
guys" clause modifies.  Interestingly enough it seems to me that
for this argument to have any merit in the way you structure it, one
must make a value judgement on who is a valiant guy and who is a bad guy.  I 
think you will find that the more sophisticated of the theorists here will argue 
that strong encryption and anonymous channels of communication should be 
available to everyone regardless of what you, I, they or the state 
department may think of their philosophy, motives or character.

While the story has merit for a demonstration of legitimate USE of
PGP, to hinge the support of that fact to the "goodness" or "badness"
of the user is to miss the point.

See above Re: your use of the word "thugs."

I think you will find again that the more sophisticated theorists
here who oppose the wide availability of anonymous channels will
transcend this argument, which is again based on a value 
judgement of the user's motives.

I guess you just support my point here.  Note that your use of
"you or anyone else" includes YOU (Dork).  It follows that
you have just eradicated your entire argument, which was based
on the decision you (Dork) had made on the legitimacy of anonymous
communication.

Might makes right?  The ability to create unlimited anonymous
accounts overrides the basic question of order?

Even if your right, I think it is you who needs to consider this
line of argument, and not us.

This is your mistake.  You'll find, I think, that cypherpunks look to
the future, and for ways to solve problems rather than:
"...bang[ing] [their] [Enter] key[s] right smartly."

Which is again, your mistake.  The application of said technology tends
to begin from "games."  Magic money is a crude "game" of sorts with a
fictitious bank, and fictitious money.  But it illuminates the problems
of digital cash in an important way.

Reckless abandon is unwise, Dork.  (As was, I might add, your nym selection.
Leaves you way to open.  :)  )

Try instead:

GENERAL ADVICE TO ALL ONLOOKERS:  Since it looks like
self-appointed ["Nym Police"] are working hard to prevent you from
[developing non-anonymous systems], I suggest that if you ever think
that you might ever have a NEED for [a non anonymous system] at any
time in the future, that you take a little time off and set up a 
[non-anonymous system] and so on and embed [it] before these guys
get their [anonymous] systems in place.  Do that NOW, because this
kind of thinking is a THREAT to you.


Just what is it that makes your "'ID police'" any more self-righteous
than you?

We won't be hearing from you more often?  Shame.

Sounds like a personal failure in the sorting process to me.

You could always ask to be removed from the list... please?

If you're so sure nyms are ok, why are you explaining yourself to us?


Some general thoughts, Dork:

Your blind application of value based arguments really takes from the
force of persuasion.  I suggest you listen more, talk less, and finish
your undergraduate education.  Many of the posters here who seem to have
less experience and "important mail" than you still seem to handle
themselves in a much more mature way.  It is clear that you are not very
open to suggestion in general, as a result I suggest you stop wasting
your important time and precious mail space, as well as ours and find
something more selfish than a group discussion to participate in.  I find
that yelling at a wall is very satisfying when I don't want to be persuaded.
You might try it.
