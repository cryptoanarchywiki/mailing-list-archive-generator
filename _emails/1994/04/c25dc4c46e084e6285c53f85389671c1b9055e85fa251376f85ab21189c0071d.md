Great idea.  Hell, you don't even really need random gibbirish; most sound
cards have such poor analog audio front ends, you could just turn up the
gain and look at the LSBs.  I've mostly used the mid-level Mac products
from Digidesign, and even they have analog noise that is easily detectable
in the lower bits.

And for MacPGP- most Macs now have a sound-in; you could either do the
noise trick again (won't work as well in 8-bit, probably), or just base it
on the backgroud sounds.
