I just started using this program (secure device) yesterday. I love the 
concept, however there is something that bugs the hell out of me... I set 
it up for a 30-meg encrypted 'volume', and the file is indeed about 30 
megs. However when I 'log in' to it, a dir shows only about ten megs of 
space. I tried creating an additional secure device volume, and this one 
was 25 megs on the outside and a bout 8 megs on the inside.  From what I 
glean from Applied Cryptography, IDEA usualy produces cyphertext 
approximately the same size as the cleartext, right? so why the massive 
difference in available space?

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
