I disagree here - politics is what makes Cypherpunks different from
a sci.crypt mailing list. As Eric Hughes points out, cryptography is
economics - and politics is economics with the gloves off. Crypto is 
inherently political. ("political" doesn't have to mean liberals - v. -
conservatives.)

Be careful the way you use the word "agenda", you're gonna get Detweiler
all worked up again. I don't think there is one agenda shared by all
list subscribers. As I see it, "cypherpunks" follows the Earth First!
model of (dis/anti) organization - there are no leaders, there is no
"policy", there is no voting, there is no platform. There are folks who
do what they choose to do, and putting a name on it makes it easier to
talk about. Myself, I'm not so wound up about getting everyone on the
planet to use crypto as I am interested in making sure we all can if we
want/need to; and that's mostly useful insofar as it more clearly 
delineates a boundary to the power/ability of the state.

I do agree that baiting and flaming are useless. The list is interesting
because it's where folks with different interests/talents/orientations
intersect, not where we diverge. Our differences and disagreements are
significant but they can also distract us from shared goals.
