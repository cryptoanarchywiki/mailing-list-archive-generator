"Excuse me? Excuse me? May I talk? Thank you.

"Now as I was saying, what we've got to to to clean up the drug
problem is just to seal off these neighborhoods and conduct some
old-fashioned house to house searches. And if we find some these
pencil-necked geeks with their traitorous secret codes, I say we just
hang 'em right there in the public square.

"It's that simple."

I don't think Perot would be too receptive to the message many of us
carry.

Understand that I actually _voted_ for the guy, mainly to send a
message of disgust to the major parties, and becuase the Libertarian
Party candidate was too much of a crook (bad loans, land swindles) to
vote for. I wouldn't have voted for Perot if he had a ghost of chance.

Now that he's self-destructed, with a paranoia that Bobby Inman tried
to duplicate, I say he's washed up. (Bobby Inman and Ross Perot, both
of Texas, have more in common than just their Texas accents. Think
about it.)
