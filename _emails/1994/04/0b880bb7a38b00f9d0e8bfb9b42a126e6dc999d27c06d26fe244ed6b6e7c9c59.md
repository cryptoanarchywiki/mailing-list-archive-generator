The big bang is also perfectly consistent with an infinite and unbounded
universe.  This is part of the well-known debate over whether the universe
is "open" or "closed".  An open universe is infinite in extent.

However, at any given time only a finite portion of the universe is avail-
able, so the infinity is not really accessible.
