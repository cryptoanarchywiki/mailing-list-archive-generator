 The idea of sweeps will never work, they'd have to do it a couple
of times a day. I don't even need to go into the
unconstitutionality of the whole process. The whole thing boils
down to trying to use a simple solution to solve a complex problem,
which works for politicians, but no one else.
 
Besides, Handguns are illegal in Chicago, and have been for more
than a decade.......

<-

Well not exactly.

It is illegal to possess an unlicensed handgun in Chicago, and
Chicago has not issued any new licenses in a decade.

An account from a friend of mine went something like this.

He had a workshop on the near west side and kept a .32 inside with
him.  The .32 was obviously unlicensed.

Long and short, he ended up at "Gun Court."  The process went something
like this:

If the defendant's skin color was lighter than the tan wall, a small
fine ($100) was imposed.

Other defendants were given hefty fines and some jail time.

Note that the first category was never asked about past records,
the second were always asked about past records.

The point is this:  Even if sweeps work, they won't "Work."
Even the judges don't seem to think that getting gun holders
off the street is a cure.  Or they don't care one way or the
other.

I do agree that this is just Bayer for cancer.
I grow tired of bearing the burden of some flunkies ideas of social
engineering.

Like I said before.  If it's an emergency, declare one and suspend
the constitution.  Otherwise, come up with a real solution.

It's amazing to me that administrations can lop all the low income
housing into large poorly built high rises and then complain that
crime is too excessive.
