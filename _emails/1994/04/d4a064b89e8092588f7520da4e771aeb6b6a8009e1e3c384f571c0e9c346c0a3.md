What is the smallest unit of access?  We should use that for digital cash.
Let's say I purchase 100 units of access on your system.  You issue a
certificate that I have this access on demand.  Then when we have an IRC
digital auction for the blueprints of Megacorp's new xray laser, I can
display my certificate and make a bid.
