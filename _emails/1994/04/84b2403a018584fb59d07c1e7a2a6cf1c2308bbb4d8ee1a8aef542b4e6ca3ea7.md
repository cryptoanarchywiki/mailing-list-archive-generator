You realize, of course, that by posting the manual verbatim you have allowed
them to discover where the leak was.  They have the ability to change the
wording slightly on every document, so that when you quote the document they
can discover who gave it to you.  That is why newspapers no longer report
quotes from documents that they have, or never show pictures of secret
documents.  Then again, for something as simple as a manual, they may not
bother to change each one.  But the capability exists.

This sort of manual is never seeded.

I'm sure the NSA will fuss because there has been a technical violation,
but in the grand scheme of things this is not a major concern except
the the extent it shows that an individual has the moral ability to
release the stuff to the public.

The information itself is not damning but law enforcement tends to
frown on the CONCEPT of such releases.

If it were seeded, Grady never would have been called.
