Jesus Christ Jones- get off Darren's back.  Cyberspace is spook central.
Learn how to live with it.  If you don't get your head together, you'll
go off the deep end like Detweiler.  This is hard ball with the big boys.
If you're not up to the game, take a break.

And Darren, that's what you get for living in California.  I quit using
CA driver's licenses when they went to the strip.  As I said via private
email, welcome aboard.  I don't care what you do.  You're a participant in
the common lot of humankind, as are we all.

Carry on cypherpunks.
