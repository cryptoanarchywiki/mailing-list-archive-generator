This is simply idiotic, worse than Hollander's childish admonition not
to throw knives.  All "keywords" do is light up those readers who do not
know what they're about, something that Hollander should explain in the
footer if he continues to do this.  These keywords ought to be placed
WITHIN the remailer disclaimer in order to make sure that readers know
where they originated and by whom.

Anyway, I won't be using the Soda remailer again.
