While ona  BBS someone brought up something about Fermat's Last THerorem 
being proven and that renders all crypto broken.  After trying to figure 
out what the hell this person was talking about I figured that he 
apparently believes that all encyptian schemes are based on large 
numbers, and since Fermats Theoremn is something like proving that youca 
find the solution for a^n + b^n = c^n   that all of the codes are broken.
 
	Now please dont mistake me for someone who has fallen for this, 
but I am just wondering what the hell this guy is talking about?




	You're eqipped with a hundred billion nueron brain, that's
	wired and fired, and it's a reality generating device, but
	you've got too do it.  Free youself  ----Tim Leary----
