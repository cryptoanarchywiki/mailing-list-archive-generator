The "Byzantine Agreement Problem" is _not_ solved in theory.  The last time
I surveyed the literature, it was still widely conjectured to be
theoretically intractable.  It has direct implications on networks and
networked systems; however, often some of the constraints of the original
problem can, with effort, be violated---which makes practical systems more
feasible.  These violations usually take the form of a second, more
reliable, band of communication.
