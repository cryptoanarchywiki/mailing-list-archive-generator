This is tangentially related to crypto.  I've been reading A.K. Dewdney's
_The New Turning Omnibus_ recently to refresh my memory of all that stuff
I learned in undergrad that I'm going to see again on the Comp Sci GRE
shortly. :-)  Anyway, I was glancing through the chapters on complexity,
computabilty, and minimax trees, and I got to wondering something:  how
many possible games of chess are there?  I know that it has to be a finite
number, but I'm not sure how to go about finding this number.  Any
pointers would be appreciated.
