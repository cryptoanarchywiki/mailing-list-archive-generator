Aha. here is where you can enlist the hacker community's experience.
Various phreaker types  have been reprogramming thier cellulars for
quite a while- usually to do  free calls instead of encrypted calls,
but the same ideas apply.  I don't know if anyone has done anything
with the DSPs, but there are various files floating around with the
codes to break into debug-mode and such for a while.

Check yer local underground BBS...
