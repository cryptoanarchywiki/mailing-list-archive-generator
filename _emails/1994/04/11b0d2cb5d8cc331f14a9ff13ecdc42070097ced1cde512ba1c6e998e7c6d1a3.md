I have a childhood friend who grew up to be a new york city cop.
we used to smoke mega drugs together. I met him at my brothers
wedding and asked him about his vocational choice, it seemed
strange. he said 'there are 20,000 new york city cops. every kind
of person you can imagine is a new york city cop'.

all generalizations are false.
