Speaking of such things, what I'd love to see is some entrepreneur out
there buying and selling "Cypherpunks 1994 World Tour" t-shirts,
decals, coffee mugs, secret decoder rings, etc.

I neglected to order one of the "Big Brother Inside" t-shirts, or one
of the "Cypherpunk Criminal" shirts, so now all I've got is my EFF
t-shirt.

(Hey, maybe that's another t-shirt idea: "The other Cypherpunks went to
federal prison for encrypting and all I got was this lousy EFF
t-shirt.")

Here's my serious point: An entrepreneur can buy up some number of
these items (3 t-shirts now, stickers) and then sell them at a markup
to folks like me, who forget or neglect to place their orders at the
right time. Capitalism at its finest.

It also spreads the word at EFF events, Libertarian Party events (or
whatever your politics are), those "rave" things Crunch is always
talking about, and so on.

Sort of a Cypherpunks Store.

P.S. If anybody has any of those previously done t-shirts they want to
sell, I'm interested.
