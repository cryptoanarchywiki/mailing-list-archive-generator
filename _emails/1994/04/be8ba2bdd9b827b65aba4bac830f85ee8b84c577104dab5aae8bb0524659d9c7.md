CAPE CANAVERAL - Computers detected potential trouble and aborted
Tuesday's launch of a Titan rocket and its military cargo in the
final seconds of countdown, the Air Force said.

It was the second attempt in three days to get the powerful booster
off the ground and into orbit with what is said to be the world's
largest and most sophisticated eavesdropping satellite, called the
Aquacade.

Air Force officials said the rocket would not be ready for a third
blastoff try before Thursday.
