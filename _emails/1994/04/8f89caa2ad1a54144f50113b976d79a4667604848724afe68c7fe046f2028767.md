Based on new information I have at last answered the question of `How many
games of Chess' with finality.  Here is the quote that woke me up to the
reality of this problem in combinatorics.

Jim choate writes:

The natural conclusion is that the complexity of the problem depends on how
much of the game you consider to be the `endgame'.  Thus, the actual number
of different chess games: 5

 2) White mates
 1) Black resigns
 0) Stalemate
-1) White resigns
-2) Black mates

Happily, this agrees with observed behavior.  In fact, this is the way
posterity remembers them, e.g., "Oh, yes, Spasky won." ;-)
