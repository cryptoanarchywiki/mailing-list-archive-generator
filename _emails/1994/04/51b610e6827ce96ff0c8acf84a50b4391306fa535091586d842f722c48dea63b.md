I would agree, but I'd add an important qualifier: "in this country"
(or "in this world," or whatever).  I think it's important to keep
in mind exactly how obedience to authority is inculcated in people
from birth.  _I_ don't think it's inborn.  The goal should be breaking
this pattern and, if it's too late for adults, at least try to raise
kids to think for themselves and not follow orders so unquestioningly.
