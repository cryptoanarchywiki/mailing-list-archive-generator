THE WAR ON DRUGS REACHES THE BEACHES OF CYBERSPACE

WASHINGTON(AP) Prompted by the rising number of reports of online  
addiction, Congresswoman April Fhurst is preparing a bill that would  
designate network connections a controlled substance.  Only  
government certified professionals would be allowed network  
connections, and only for a limited number of hours per day.

The bill also mandates that all network venders, manufactures of  
network equipment, and network software developers must design in  
mechanisms to record the length of time each person spends accessing  
a networked resource and to automatically contact the DEA when a  
person exceeds safe limits.

Use of unauthorized or noncompliant network devices, computers, or  
software will be a felony.  Any equipment used in the act of  
felonious network access, and any files obtained via the network  
would be subject to forfeiture under the RICO laws.
