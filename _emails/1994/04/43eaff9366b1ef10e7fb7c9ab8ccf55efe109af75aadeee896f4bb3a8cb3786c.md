The average citizen operates from a paradigm of self interest, perhaps
extended to his/her family.  If a governmental action does not resonate
with this paradigm- (i.e. "what's in it for me?")- the government action
goes largley unnoticed.  When the Reagan administration exhumed the 1888
Law allowing military to assist law enforcement, but not make arrests, I
took note of that because it directly affected my life.  Almost no one
else paid any attention to it.

Another facet of human nature one can trust is 75% of the population will
follow a direct order without much question, given the person issuing the
order appears to have the authority to do so.  I am Emergency Medically
Trained.  When the shit hits the fan, I order people to preform specific
tasks, most notibally calling 911.  If a person stands there and thinks,
I order another to do it.  It only takes a matter of seconds to organize
a concerted team effort to aid the victim- because I am the responsible
person.  They are not accountable for their actions anymore in their minds,
I am.

This isn't civilization, it's gregarious herd instinct ;)
