I doubt that these electronic financial instruments will be designed to
offer new protections to individual privacy.  As more commerce moves onto the
net, opportunities for database linking will multiply drastically.  In such
an environment, electronic dossiers of buying and spending habits will be
far easier to develop.

So once again we have the command-and-control style key certificate
hierarchy.  Everyone is neatly ordered and positioned in the
structure.  A place for everyone and everyone in his place.

I suppose it goes without saying that the kinds of privacy-protecting
credentials we have been discussing are not what is being discussed here.
Rather, we have more authentication, more registration, more tracking of
every electronic financial move we make.

Evidently the "commerce" that is being planned here does not anticipate much
demand for encryption of messages from sellers to buyers; rather, the
important thing is encryption in the opposite direction to protect those
credit card numbers.  This also, of course, limits RSA's financial commitment
in making its technology available; my reading is that end-users get only the
ability to validate signatures for free, and that getting to use their own keys
will involve royalty payments.

I was pleased to see that in their later message they added support for
PGP to this list, although it seems that they are still thinking mostly in
terms of "officially sanctioned" systems:

This is outrageous!  Where on earth did they get the idea that non-U.S.
residents have access only to 40 bit keys and RC2/RC4?  As though the only
encryption the rest of the world has is whatever the U.S. government deigns
to let cross its borders?  What an insult to the rest of the world.  And what
an attempt at self-deception to pretend that these export controls are
effective.  I sincerely doubt that the international network community will
accept such a limitation in what claims to be an international standard.

The one good thing that may come from this initiative is that more people
will be using and relying on encryption.  Given the widespread skepticism
about the government in this country, it will be that much harder to get a
Clipper-like program into place.

But the initiative does clearly show the pernicious effects of the combined
restrictions of the RSA patents and the NSA export controls.  Together [RN]SA
provides a structured, ordered system which provides the minimal possible
privacy necessary for electronic commerce.  Far more is possible, but is un-
likely under the current legal regime.
