  But this has nothing to do with writing code. There are plenty of
people on this list who aren't writing code, who most likely have
better writing skills than CS/Engineering majors, and who have the
time to write remailer faqs and evangelize remailer use. This type of project 
can be done in parallel with remailer development. I don't see why any 
priority scheme is needed. Cypherpunks, as often repeated, are not a 
monolithic group governed from the top-down who obey directions to focus all
their efforts on one priority.

   Maybe because it would get voted down or maybe because no one has
RFD'd it yet. Nothing is stopping anyone from going ahead and doing
this. An alt group would be better.

   This is already included in my new remailer, but I proposed a 
"remailer server" for keeping an up to date automatically generated
list of working remailers almost a year ago (I even hacked up some
partially working code for it) when it became obvious that Karl's
list of remailers weren't good enough (although it was a good effort)
The biggest problem is getting a stable machine or
a stable network of 'DNS'-like machines.

   There is already a similar mechanism for MUDs. Besides the static
list of running muds there is a MUD "mudwhod" server which maintains
a list of running muds and who is logged into them.

  This type of standardization is only likely to spontaneously evolve
after a remailer network is already up and running and these policy
issues come up. I don't think we can centrally draft some kind of
Constitution/Bylaws for remailers which covers all possible future
problems. Remailer politics and legal systems are an unexplored area.
I think we should leave it up to the remailer operators for now since
they will have to deal with these issues first hand.

   It could be that the best encapsulation method for remailer
messages hasn't been developed yet. I certainly think the
recursive-pasting token method needs a lot of work. A method should
be general enough to work with any RSA/Pkey system and not rely on
PGP's standard format. Cut lines definately needed to be standardized
abstracted away from the underlying cryptosystem.

   Either way works, and the actual method used will probably be
a combination of both. However, getting cypherpunk software
installed in existing distributions will require some politics and
lobbying on behalf of cypherpunks. (e.g. getting remailer mods into
something like Eudora might be really hard)

   Already exists. Almost every Unix system I have encounted comes with
atleast Perl4, and many come with TCL. Perl is a standard environment
and any correctly installed Perl should run a correctly written Perl
script. I'd say that one can create a remailer/client in Perl that
can be installed by almost anyone. (as long as you don't rely on
"absolute" paths which change, or non-standard environment variables)

  The biggest thing you're missing is the fact that many users can't
even understand how to use LISTSERVs or run mail(1) To many people,
typing "::\n request-remailing-to: xxxx" and encrypting it, then adding
"Encrypted: PGP" is a huge transaction cost. I don't use remailers
for similar reasons. A simple mod to the elm script, "mailpgp" which
detects a remailer in the To: address, prompts you for "mail
anonymously to? " and then does all the underlying remailer commands
and chaining stuff automatically would be a huge benefit. Even
better would be a script which asks you "Mail anonymously?" and if
answered yes, it would automatically pick a remailer and do the
nasty stuff.

  Emacs and Elm are pretty standard, plug in elisp/perl scripts 
would work fairly well to encourage remailer use but
some evangelization would be required also to encourage use and educate.
I once suggested that someone set up a porno-server on the remailer
network as the ultimate carrot-and-stick method for getting people to use
remailers. I still think this is a good idea. (after all, the
two biggest uses of Julf's system I see are in the sex newsgroups and in 
IRC phreak/warez trading)
