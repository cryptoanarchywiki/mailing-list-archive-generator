Yes, this is true, but a picture from the ATM machine will place you
as the one who got the bill instead of the thief that took your card
and guessed your PIN.  Proof is hard with current levels of tech since
you can't prove something of this nature with computer files.  Afterall,
it may not even be me typing this right now... You'd have to be here to
"catch" me to prove it in court (assuming a sane jury :).
  Take care
