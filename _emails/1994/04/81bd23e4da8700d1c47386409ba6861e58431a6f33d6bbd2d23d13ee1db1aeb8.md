This illustrates my point precisely. Look at the messages on this thread
over the past few days; questions about 'common carrier' status, legal
questions, etc reveal that there is, in practice, more to running a 
'full service remailer' than just setting up the software. 

Running multiple overseas remailers may complicate investigations and
legal action *for now*, but I can't help feeling that this is only a
temporary fix. [My opinion, ignore at will..]

Bill Stewart raised some concerns about whether it is possible to
forge return addresses; I am certainly not an expert, but I wonder
whether some inspired cypherpunk can come up with a way around the
technical problems involved. [Sips coffee, raises eyebrow] If 'they'
can't find the remailer operator (much less the anonymous poster), 
then all these questions of culpability and risk are moot.
