Hello once again...
	My friend and I wanted to know how that FOIA request was coming? I 
haven't heard anything from the list, so I thought I would ask.

	Also, who the hell is this Detweiler person? And why is everyone saying 
he's tmp@netcom.com?
	
	Thanks,
	Adam Gerstein
	GERSTEIN@SCSUC.STATEU.EDU

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of phone 
calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
