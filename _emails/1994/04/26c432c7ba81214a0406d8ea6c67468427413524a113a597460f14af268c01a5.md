	Well you have to understand that the people who usually hang out 
on #hackl, #warez etc.. are really just the lower end of the scale when 
it comes to ability and commitment.  Sure a REAL hack/crack/phreaker 
comes on once in a great while, but most of them are just kids out trying 
to makea name for themsleves and ragging on each other etc...

	Most of the real hackers etc.. are all for crypto and such to 
ensure privacy.  Some even write their own code for it and utilize it 
alot.  It pays to know about it, and when it's a real hacker you bvet 
they know alot about it just out of standard hacker curiosity.  Myself, I 
wish I knew that much, but im learning everyday.  My newest project that 
me and someone else on the list are working on is a simple implementation 
of Unix's Talk.  The y-talk that is encrypted has a hard time compiling 
on all the systems I have tried it so we are going to go for something 
simpler and more portable perhaps.  When I try to compile the YTalk app 
on soda, i get barfs from SunOS, and Linux.

	So far we are going to use a "gollman cascade" (sp?) as a tream 
cypher.  If anyone else out there has any good stream cyphers that are 
decent in security and speed please let me know.  But so far the one we 
have now seems to be the easiest t implement within our limited coding 
skills.
	

	You're eqipped with a hundred billion nueron brain, that's
	wired and fired, and it's a reality generating device, but
	you've got too do it.  Free youself  ----Tim Leary----
