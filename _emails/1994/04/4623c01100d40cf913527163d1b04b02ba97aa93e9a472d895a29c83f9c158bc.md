	Won't happen.  Espaecially since there is not some

	matter of fact, not all providers are companies, some are
	colleges who could ill afford such keyboards, and even
	some more are simply people running providers out of
	their basementsand bedrooms.  Not only that, butsuch a
	system would be bypassable by abusers and their ilk.
	Just like the social security and drivers license system
	is easily bypassable by abusers who so desire.  But you
	did put the legal limiter in thier, but as we both now,
	that doesnt mean shit in this world really.

	hehe, the who idea of saying we don't need stinking rules
	being a setting up of our own rules is ludicrous.  That's
	the argument I would expect froma  afifth grader.  How
	will mysystem deal with crackers etc?  I will do my best
	with security as I can, ye I know these still leaves me
	open to attack, but that's part of the territory.
	Because even if you DO set upa list of guidelines these
	things would still happen.  Your trying to put laws on
	people who have no intention of following them.  Do you
	think a law outlawing cracking sniffing etc would stop
	someone capable of them who wanted to?  Noway.  And by
	the way, suggested guidelines and niceties are not
	"illegal" in an anarchy.  You make the mistake of
	thinking that all anarchy means everyone kill everyone
	else, but it doesnt.  Basically I have no problems with
	being nice with agreements, but don't try to make them
	law, because all that does is make more criminals and
	doesnt reduce the problems.

	I will always have connection to the internet if I desire
	it, be it legal or not, but yes, I do have a bit of
	compassion for those unable to do that.  My answer tho is
	not regulations and the like, my answer is to make it as
	open as possible, the more people providing the more
	freedom and competition to drive down prices.  When I can
	provide acces from my bedroom, and it is reasonable to do
	so, then any concept of restrictions is nullified, since
	there is no way of enforcing them really.  And the good
	news is, that I CAN run a provider on my lowly budget if
	I so desire NOW.  the answer is not an ORGANIZATION,
	since they would have no ral jurisdiction or power on the
	net, the answer is to make setting up providers very
	easy.  My favorite example of this is FIDOnet, and the
	hundrds of other bbs nets that sprang up with it,after
	it.  FIDO net may have a central organization or set of
	laws, but I can think of a lot of such nets that have no
	rules, tho yes I do admit noen as big as FIDO net.

	No, for the first, I dont pass mail thru your system, and
	no I would not send screiching mail to upstream
	providers.  I would simply find a way to deal with it
	thru filters or rerouting, or I would cope.  I know this
	may not be appealing to alot of people, but I see it as
	the only viable option.

	NO fuckin kiddin.  And you seem to have some desire to
	create your own cybergods with your organizations. IMO
	yeah such organizations weould be nice for show, to
	develop niceties etc.. but they would have no real power
	at all.  What garauntees my connection?  Well for some
	people it's cash, money, for others it's their job, for
	me it's who I know and my skills.  Im in school now so my
	connection is provided for, if the school decided to go
	elsewhere, I would go to a local provider or to another
	method.  As for how would I deal with these pathological
	habits, I would certainly not rely on some central
	organization which itself would be unable to stop them.
	There part of life, and their part of cyberlife(badpun).

	That's true, it's reasonable but easily broken if really

	Also account hijacking is unnecasary most of the time to
	reek havoc.

	Because there is no real us.  You'll never get rid of the
	abusers, and yes it will be an amorphous blob.  You
	cannot police kyberspace, since I can create my own
	extension of that spacde at will, all I need is a willing
	provider, or an unwilling provider whos a little lax in
	security.

	Cool, I would dig talking with morris, mitnick, and

	it will NEVER happen.  Settin gupa  provider is too easy.
	All you will do by enforcing regulations and the ilk is
	making it harder to provide acces at a grass roots
	level.

	Your a fool if you think that what I want is a place wher
	noone is responsible.  I just said that organizations and
	regulations will not make those who are the abusers any
	more responsible.  I see as much potential in kyberspace
	as you do, to make a change etc.. but a centralization of
	something that is inaely decentralized, at it's core is
	utter stupidity.

	I myself dont even know the basic cypherpunk views, it's
	just my views, dont rty and group me or anyone else
	please.  So which one of our religions is the equivalent
