Let me be blunt. You aren't going to deploy a complete new cellular
phone system on your own. If you do think you are, you have lost your
mind. You can't just hack a CDMA or similar phone to make it secure --
the other end has to be speaking the same protocol. The other end is a
very expensive station built and paid for by your local cellular
provider which is unlikely to be easily modified by you the customer.

You aren't going to be able to run your own cellphone system, either.

Perry
