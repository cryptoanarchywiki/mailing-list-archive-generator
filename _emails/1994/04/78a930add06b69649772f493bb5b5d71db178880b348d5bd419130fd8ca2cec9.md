As I pointed out before, this probability is not correct.  The trials
are not independent, so you cannot just multiply them together.

For some good information on primality testing, see

	A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory
	by Henri Cohen

Chapter 9 is titled "Modern Primality Tests".  I give you fair warning
that you will not be able to understand this without significant
effort.  The Pocklington-Lehmer primality test is in Chapter 8
"Factoring in the Dark Ages".

There's a very interesting result stated here, "There exists a
probabilistic polynomial time algorithm which can prove or disprove
that a given number N is prime".  The result is by Adleman and Huang.
(Yes, _that_ Adleman.)

And for purposes of cultural literacy, the names are the Jacobi sum
test, the elliptic curve tests, Goldwasser-Kilian, and Atkin (a
development on G-K).
