You still need infinite pockets with transaction costs of zero.
Again, it's only this one example that's flawed, not other ways around
it.

Ever been suspicious of the run-up in prices of Impressionist
paintings by the Japanese a few years ago?  Give someone an
inexpensive painting (or have them buy it), and then buy it at an
inflated rate from them, at auction.
