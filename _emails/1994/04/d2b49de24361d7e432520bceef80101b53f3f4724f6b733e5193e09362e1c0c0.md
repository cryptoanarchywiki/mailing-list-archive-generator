You still need infinite pockets with transaction costs of zero.
Again, it's only this one example that's flawed, not other ways around

Ever been suspicious of the run-up in prices of Impressionist

inexpensive painting (or have them buy it), and then buy it at an
inflated rate from them, at auction.
