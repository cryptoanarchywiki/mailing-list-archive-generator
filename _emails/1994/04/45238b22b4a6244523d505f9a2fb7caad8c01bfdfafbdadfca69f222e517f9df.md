The San Francisco papers had a few articles a week ago about the
San Francisco police giving out somebody's address from motor-vehicle
records to her ex-boyfriend who was stalking her, as well as other
private data - he got the information several times as she moved around.
It's supposedly a misdemeanor, but of course the computers don't keep track
of who requested what data, so they don't know which cop you can't trust.

(Anybody who tries stalking me using motor vehicle records will either
wonder how I keep all my furniture in that little box, or else
have to figure out how to find my streeet address from my mailing
address, not that that's real hard...)
