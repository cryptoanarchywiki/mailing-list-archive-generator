  If there is a group calling itself "Free Thinkers" then I'll revise my
  comments.  I was unaware of any such group and meant only that folks
  should think for themselves and not just blindly follow their "herd
  instincts" (Had to work that side thread in here :).  Sorry if I made
  an unwitting reference to any group.
