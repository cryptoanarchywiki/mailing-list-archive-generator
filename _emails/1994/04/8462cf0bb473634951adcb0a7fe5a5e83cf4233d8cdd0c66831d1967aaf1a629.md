One point here- you are not actually suppressing the transmission of your
phone number. It is transmitted *between switches* in any case- you are
simply suppressing the transmission from a switch to the destnation phone.
This is important in relation to the phone company recieving data, as well
as the distinct possibility that a clever person could still get this. I
got the above info out of Phrack Magazine (_Caller ID Technical Details_ by
Hyperborean Menace
#45-06, still being issued as I write this).

Don't know, but from what little I know about the phone company, I would
assume using the demand-dial numbers (like 102880) for ATT) from another
long distance phone would be a start.
