Sounds like something the Nigerians would try.

Nevertheless, I think there would be some value to a GrayNet.  There's a
difference between intelligence gathering and analysis on the one hand,
and espionage on the other.  Several businesses in the "competitive
intelligence" arena operate quite openly.

And of course, the major players like to work through proxies.

A GrayNet would have the advantage of establishing the true value of
closely-held information.  Programming is turning into an "electronic
sweat-shop" these days -- here's a chance to turn the situation around.
Employers will not be able to afford to treat programmers as expendable,
if by releasing them, they empower their competitors.

The immediate problem is to find a data haven where the information will
be secure from seizure.

Info workers of the world unite!  Your craniums are your capital!
