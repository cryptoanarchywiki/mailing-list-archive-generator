Jeff, Perry isn't questioning your description of Milgram's experiments,
he was questioning the dates - '76 seems awfully late for that work
to have been new and exciting (as opposed to old and exciting.)
(Yes, that may imply he's questioning your credibility,
or delving into deeper philosophical questions like whether you're 
really just another incarnation of Detweiler :-)

On the other hand, it may be that the time you heard Milgram speaking
wasn't the *first* time he'd given his talk - he's probably
spoken on the topic a few gazillion times, especially if he's
talking to college audiences...
