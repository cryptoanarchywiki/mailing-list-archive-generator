What!? You're going to tell me that a man with your obvious intelligence
and joie de vivre didn't know?  

The aliens(Skree-nok as they're called) are being kept hostage in order
to prompt their government into transferring technology to the evil NSA
in order to help it.  The Clipper chip was just a tidbit of the power
that the aliens have.

The NSA among its other projects is trying to wangle a device that will
allow the access to the brain of PRZ to help them put a back door inside
PGP and the aliens want a sacrifice of 2^10 virgins for this. 

<sigh>

We're all doomed.....
