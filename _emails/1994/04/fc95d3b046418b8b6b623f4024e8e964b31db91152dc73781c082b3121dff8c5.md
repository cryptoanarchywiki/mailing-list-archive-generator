Tim's point, though was that we don't "need" cheaper access,
and government-regulation solutions to achieve this pressing social need
are not only bad, but unnecessary - if the government really wants
to provide people with cheaper net access, it can hand them money,
with less distortion of the market than regulation.

One of the problems with the EFF open access proposals is that they
tend to favor, or at least tolerate, regulation of the networks,
which is an invitation to disaster, however well-intentioned it may be.
