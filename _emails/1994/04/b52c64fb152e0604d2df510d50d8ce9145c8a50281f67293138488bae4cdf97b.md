	The information itself is not damning but law enforcement tends to
	frown on the CONCEPT of such releases.

	If it were seeded, Grady never would have been called.

What I found interesting was that it was published in Phrack about
a week ago, and nothing happened, but when Grady reposted it, suddenly
phone-calls come aflying.  Either this means that the NSA read Grady's
posts more diligently than everyone else's, or Grady went out of his
way to tell them that he'd posted it, which wouldn't surprise me...
