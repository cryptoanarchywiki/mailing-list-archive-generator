Uh, As far as I've heard, Ames was not a major Blacknet user.
The unknown grunt in the intelligence community who caught
him is another matter.
 
Hanno Reductionist

You are obviously clueless.

Ames transfered most if not all of his information through Blacknet.
The recent attention to the security of the internet is at least
partially a function of the ease with which export restricitons
and espionage are facilitated on a DAILY BASIS by blacknet.

It is the easiest method of underground data transfer.  Period.

This will [thankfully] be my last post on the subject.
I've drawn quite enough attention to myself already.
