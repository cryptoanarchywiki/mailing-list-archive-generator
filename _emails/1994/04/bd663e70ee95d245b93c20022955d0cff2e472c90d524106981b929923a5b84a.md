The constitutional requirement and the need for some coherent policy to
be attached to grants explains why the Clipper and Digitel projects are
hefted under the umbrella of the crime crisis.  It allows huge federal
grants (bigger now that the crime bill is law) to be "stringed" and
these projects (Clipper etc.) to be "voluntarily encouraged" by the
threat of withdrawal of government largess.  (In this instance the crime
bill grants).
<-

I should mention that the crime bill is still in joint commitee and not
yet "law."

At least I think that's the case.

It's to early to check.
