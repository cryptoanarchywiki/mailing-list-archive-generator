The point is that  even if you  think anyone  with a viewpoint
opposing yours is automatically stupid and not worth your time
(and I don't think  that  too many of you are that bad off ;),
aren't they at least  worth  using  to  further  something you
believe strongly in? It  might  do  well  to  be   careful  in
alienating   potential  allys  by  flip  political  jokes  and
comments.

From a cartoon in the  Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago:
A couple are sitting on a park bench, and she says to him:
"I'm sorry, Bernie, but my financial planner says you're a 
non-performing asset and should be dumped!"
