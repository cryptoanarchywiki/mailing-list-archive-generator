The subjects were very upset during and after the experiment.  Some broke 
down while administering "lethal" shocks.  They often cried and begged the 
"researcher" to let them stop zapping the victim.  In those cases where a 
white coated researcher with a clipboard was standing behind them, the 
subject was much more likely to impose greater shocks than if there was no 
"researcher" present.

The main reason they did it is because they were being told to.  Primates 
have a hard time disobeying authority figures or standing out from the 
crowd.
