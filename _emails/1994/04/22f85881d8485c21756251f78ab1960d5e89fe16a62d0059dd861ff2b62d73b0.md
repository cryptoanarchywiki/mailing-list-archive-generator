One major reason that I pay attention to the IETF-EDI discussions on
EDI over the Internet it to make sure that someone brings up
encrypting EDI transactions. I'm convinced that EDI over the 'net will
explode, and strong encryption (PGP, PEM, etc.) will be required.

The IETF-EDI is basing their work on MIME. While it isn't perfect,
it is an existing standard, has a published RFC, etc.

I strongly second Hal's suggestion that developers of mailers and remailers
look at MIME and use it as a starting point.
