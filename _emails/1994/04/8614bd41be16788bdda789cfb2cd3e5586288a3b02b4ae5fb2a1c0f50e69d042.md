there was a popular song in the (1910's? 1920's?) called 'the man who
broke the bank at monte carlo' and I do recall reading (in a book of
sports records of all places) that this was based on the exploits of a
real guy (the reason the tale appeared in a book of sports records was
because of the level of endurance the guy showed; he stayed at the table
18 - 24 hours a day while he was gambling). I don't recall any of the 
particulars, or how much he took from the casino (and was it roulette or
baccarat?), or even his name but I am pretty sure this was a true story.
