Pretend the casino is run out of a church.  "Parishioners" arrive and
enter a confessional to place their bets.  The "priest" cannot see who
is placing each bet.  Each "parishioner" plays until he or she is
broke.  "Parishioners" arrive at a steady rate and will do so
indefinitely.

How can the "priest" tell who is broke and who isn't?  Why should he
care?  The chance of the "church" to win or lose is the same on every
bet, regardless of who places it.

What you have constructed is an outcome where the house is almost
certain to make a miniscule amount, but has a slim chance of a massive
loss.  This is not what "making money" means.  Think about what the
return on investment is likely to be.  I don't think you will find an
"inevitable process of cash extraction".  That only occurs if the odds
favor of the house.

I think you may be misapplying your reading.  Duration of play is
interesting, but I hope the actual issue is making money.  They are
not the same thing.

This can be very confusing.  I've seen two professional mathematicians
and a futures textbook make this mistake.
