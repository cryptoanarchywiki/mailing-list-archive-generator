From: Timothy C. May:

"And we'll be moving our trade, our entertainment, and much of our
lives into cyberspace a whole lot faster than we'll be slowly moving
into low Earth orbit and beyond. In fact, I consider that I'm already
half-way in. In a few years, with Mosaic-like one-touch connectivity,
with a plethora of network choices, with secure remailers and similar
tools to anonymize my transactions, I'll be so far in there'll be [no]
turning back."

Actually, some of us could become quite bored and decide to go to the 
beach, instead.
Sometime, someday (when you least expect it), you'll have to come out 
and do some 3-dimensional living.
