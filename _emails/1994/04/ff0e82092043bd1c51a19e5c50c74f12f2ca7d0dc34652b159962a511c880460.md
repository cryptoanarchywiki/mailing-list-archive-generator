  I replied to Dave via mail but it may warrant a public clarification.

  My intent is not to form a group to go lobby congress or anything of
  that nature.  My idea was to create a list of "credentials" for the
  group as a whole so that when active folks do go to the press or to
  meetings between CPSR & the NSA then they can have in their hands a
  bit of "proof" that we aren't the computer-student-woodstock-wannabes
  the NSA et al. say we are.

  Remember the E.F. Hutton commercials where a guy is asked for investment
  advice and he says "My broker is EF Hutton and EF Hutton says..." and
  everyone in the room gets quiet and leans over to hear the advice?  That
  is what the Cypherpunks name doesn't have... respect.

  Your comments, either for or against, are appreciated and counted.  They
  will be used to help me see if there is sufficient interest in my opinion
  to warrant trying to organize such a thing.  Right now it's slightly in
  favor but there are too few replies to be fair either way.

  Jim
