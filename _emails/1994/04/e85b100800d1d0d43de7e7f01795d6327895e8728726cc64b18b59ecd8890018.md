I don't know about Nafta or anything specificly, however it is my 
understanding that there is no 'outlawed' crypto in canada. I think that 
export restrictions are the same or a little tighter than in the US, as 
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) of the united states 
says that strong crypto can not be exported from the U.S. except to 
Canada. I'm not sure what patent issues apply either.

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
