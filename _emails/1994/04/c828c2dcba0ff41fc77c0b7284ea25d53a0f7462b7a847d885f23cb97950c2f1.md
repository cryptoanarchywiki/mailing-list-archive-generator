There is also the interesting realization that even if the Schneier
source code were to be mailed or FTP'ed outside the country, without
actual evidence of those acts there would be nothing to disprove an
assertion that it was typed in from the legally exportable book.

But, as they say, "that would be wrong".
	
I'm *still* waiting for a response to my CJ request for this disk. They
either ignore my calls or put me off with "it's coming soon", but it's
now almost May and I still don't have an official ruling on my "15-day"
request, which was filed in early March.
