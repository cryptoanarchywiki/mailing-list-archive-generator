There's the rub.  This is a case of "don't shoot the messanger".

Yes, officer, I do keep a log of all messages.  However, we do
not have the quota to keep the records for an extended period of
time.  They are deleted on a daily basis.  Yes, Sir I understand
that it takes longer than 24 hours for you to obtain a warrant.
Perhaps you can speak to the matter more directly with the
judiciary to help expedite their requirements.

You can count on my *complete* co-operation, however, you must
understand that their are liability issues which must be
addressed.  We stand advised that we can not release any
information without the appropriate paper work.  I'm sure you
understand that. ;-)
