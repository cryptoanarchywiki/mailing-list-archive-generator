	Hiya.

	I'm hoping you all can help me.  I want to set up a remailer 
here, and was wondering if you had any sugestions on where to get 
software (for a unix based machine) for both Anonymous remailing, and for 
Digital encrpytation.
	I'm VERY new to all this, and desperately need help getting 
started. Any and all help will be apreciated. 
	Thanks....
