(1)  Tell that to the people who have had their assets seized and sold 
     without any criminal charges ever being made.

(2)  "Proof" and "guilty" are legal words of art.  Stop looking at them 
     in some ultimate sense of right and wrong.  Everyday, proof that 
     isn't proof is used to find people guilty who are not guilty.

Press coverage is . . . "nice" but is it stopping the Clipper?  Is it 
guaranteeing strong crypto?  There are those among us who are taking 
actions that don't require winning the hearts and minds of politicians 
and entrenched bureaucrats.  Would you rather wait until it is too late?
