I have been following this list for several months, but have not seen
anything on encryption issues with regards to Canada specifically.

Does anyone know anything about [or have any idea where to begin to
look for] Canada's policies regarding encryption and encryption
technology??  Will Canadian laws change if/when Clipper encryption comes
into functional existence?  What about if the US enacts laws regarding
making other forms of encruyption illegal?  Is encryption mentionned in
NAFTA or any other negotiated treaty with the United States???


Thanks,
