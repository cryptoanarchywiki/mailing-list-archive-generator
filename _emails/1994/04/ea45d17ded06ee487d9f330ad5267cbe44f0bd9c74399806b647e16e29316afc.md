A friend of mine who's a lawyer has a subtle pseudo in the phone book
because he doesn't want to be harrassed at home by clients. (Basically
he's listed under a deliberate misspelling of his name.) The phone
company cheerfully listed him under a different name than the one on
his bill. The "professor" in question is likely very very wrong.
