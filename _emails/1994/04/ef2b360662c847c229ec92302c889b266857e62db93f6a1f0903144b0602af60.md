[Paul Ferguson] has written:
|  
| A Page 1 story in The Washington Post Sunday (94.04.17) reads,
| "Clinton Lets Police Raid Projects," "Warrantless Searches Said to Be
| Needed For Tenants Safety."
|  
| For those who haven't been following this ludicrous story, the USG has
| now decided that Chicago Housing Authority-sponsored, and warrantless,
| searches of dwellings within the CHA, is "A Good Thing" (tm) and
| specifically geared towards uncovering weapons of criminals (or
| would-be criminals) for the safety of law-abiding Housing tenants.
|  
| Personally, I find this mentality alarming and indicative of a growing
| trend within the government. "Big Brother knows best."
|  
| Vile and Nauseating.
|  
| This is another absurdity in the "War on Drugs" and "War on Crime."
| More government-sponsored "wars" are undoubtedly on the horizon,
| perhaps even a war on non-escrowed crypto.
|  
| I suppose things will get worse before they get better.

Personally, I find the idea of government-owned housing alarming and 
indicative of a growing trend within the government. "Big Brother knows 
best."

Vile and Nauseating.
