Actually, someone asked about Clipper at the CommerceNet launch yesterday. The
question was (paraphrasing):

   "I noticed you've decided to go with RSA for cryptography. How does Clipper
fit into this? [as in, what's your position on Clipper?]"

To which Allan Schiffman, CTO of EIT (the main technical architects of the
CommerceNet system), replied (paraphrasing):

   "Apparently, Clipper is only for voice-encryption, so it has absolutely no
relevance to this system [secure Mosaic]."

This response received a nice smattering of applause from the participants.

Except that the full version of this announcement--which has been
posted several places, possibly even here in Cypherpunks--explicitly
mentions the use of RSA via a business relationship with RSA Data
Security Inc.

Though many Cypherpunks have various problems with RSADSI and the RSA
patents, a topic I'll not go into further, it is a hopeful sign for
Internet commerce that a strong crypto system is being built in from
the git go.

Remember, the alternative is Crippler! (Actually, what with the
announcement of Crippler being built in to some television-top
boxes--cf. the Harry Hawk posts--I would guess these Internet Commerce
folks will soon be "visited" by Crippler advocates and "suitably
incentivized" to replace RSA with EES technology.)
