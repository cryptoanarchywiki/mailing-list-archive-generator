I've found anon.penet.fi to be VERY slow lately, remails taking on the 
order of 3-5 days, which makes it impossible to use.  Of course, like the 
rest of them, it's free and a service to the Net and a needed utility, so 
I'm not going to complain.  However, it has forced me to look elsewhere 
and find faster ones...

I did write to help@ and ask if there was a problem...for the general 
benefit of cryptogensia everywhere, here's the reply I got:

  Some users have flooded the server with hundreds and hundreds of messages.
That slows the server down greatly (posting and e-mailing times up to 3 days).
Some messages might have even disappeared because these hundreds of messages
fill up the diskspace and there is no more room for new messages.

Be patient.

Sorry about the inconvenience,
	Zarr
