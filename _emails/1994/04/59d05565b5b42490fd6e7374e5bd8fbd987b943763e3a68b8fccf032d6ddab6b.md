While I will say that guns and housing projects are important topics, as 
well as the loss of our individual freedoms, I will agree with my 
esteemed colleague from the great state of California that this list *is* 
about writing code, etc.

In that spirit, spurred on by my f**king netcom account being broken into 
by some idiot with a packet sniffer, I've been looking into hacking 
"pgptalk" (actually, ytalk with a popen() call to pgp and D-H key 
exchange) to provide the same sort of functionality for telnet.  The 
target platforms are SunOS (which is what netcom runs) and linux.

On first investigation, it doesn't look too hard to do the D-H key 
exchange stuff, as they are separated out into separate modules.  I've 
got the source for telnet/telnetd, and have added enhancements (like 
blasting out /etc/issue on connect), so I hope it won't be to difficult a 
project.

Sure would be nice to be able to do it in such a way that doesn't violate 
ITAR.  Does anyone know if D-H key exchange qualifies as restricted under 
the ITAR?  I can always do a popen() to pgp like ytalk does, and let the 
buyer be responsible for getting their hands on PGP or a look-alike.
