Robert Mathews <mathews@gold.chem.hawaii.edu> be aware

============================================================

Are you the sender?  Do you know who the sender is?  Why exactly is this
person defaming my name with this outrageous accusation?

The only recent contact I know of was that Robert Mathews sent a message
to soda.berkeley.edu where (for whatever his reason was) he was warning
against Sameer's 14.4 link.  I personally do NOT know why he (Mathews)
felt it necessary to send that message on like he did.  The only reason I
sent it to him was as part of a discussion of bandwidth/services for a
network we are working on which will support multiple users and multiple
connect types.  But in either case, if this was the source of the msg from
nobody@jarthur.cs.hmc.edu, it was way off base.
