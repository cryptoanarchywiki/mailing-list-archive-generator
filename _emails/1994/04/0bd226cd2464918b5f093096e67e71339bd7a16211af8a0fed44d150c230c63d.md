On final comment about this, it is illegal in many states to deface your 
driver license "willfully."  Thus, if you were to demagnatize the strip
intentionally, you would likely be committing a crime.  Of course, if your
mom used the refrigerator magnet to put your DL on the 'fridge after you 
left in on the kitchen table during breakfast and that inadvertantly 
de-mag'd your DL, there probably is no crime.

Remember, you must be proven guilty.  In such a circumstance, the only 
way anyone could prove that you were guilty is if you admitted to it.
