For all the newbies who keep asking for info on the remailers, the address is:
  mg5n+remailers@andrew.cmu.edu

You can get an anonymous address from mg5n+getid@andrew.cmu.edu
Each time you request an anon address, you get a different one.  You can
get as many as you like.  The addresses don't expire, however, so maybe
it's not the ideal 'one-shot' system, but it allows replies without
connecting you to your 'real name/address' or to any of your other
posts/nyms.
