EFF Board member and Cygnus Support co-founder John Gilmore has set up a
World Wide Web page on cryptography export issues, including information
on how to apply for export clearance, exchages with Commerce Dept. on
export licensing, legal documents on networking issues in relation to
export of technology and crypto, and more.   The URL is:

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
- Philip Elmer-Dewitt, "Who Should Keep the Keys", TIME, Mar. 14 1994
