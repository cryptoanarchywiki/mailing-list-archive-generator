The only message I think is worth communicating is "We're doing our own
thing. You will not be able to stop us because of [ .. reasons ..] so
don't bother trying. Have a nice day." and I'm inclined to think even
that is unnecessary. Terrorism and psychological warfare could be
considered a form of communication; it is, after all, intended to create
or maintain a particular understanding on the part of others; but it is
not communication in the same way that a letter is. I don't know anything
at all about what Jeff is up to, so he'll have to speak for his own
(actual) motives and purposes; I was hoping to point out that what he's
up to can seem more useful when it's not considered in the context of
a rational discourse within polite society.

I've got no idea what you mean by "normal circumstances"; if your point
is that totalitarianism sucks, I agree. I could chatter on about how I
think things ought to be, but I don't imagine most folks give a damn.
I believe we have a right to work towards a social/political structure
(or lack thereof) where our capabilities are fruitfully and fully
engaged, whether or not bureacrats and dictators find that convenient.
(Of course, they may have already found the state where *their*
capabilities are best engaged .. :)

Uhh .. a right to privacy (and to the use of strong crypto) whether or 
not that makes other people nervous or damages their fragile confidence?

The usual pattern is destabilization, then a power grab by whatever
group is correctly positioned - either revolutionaries or the local
military. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

Personally, I'm inclined vis-a-vis the NSA and TLA's in general to let
sleeping dogs lie, at least for the moment. Other folks (Grady, Jeff)
see opportunities differently; I encourage folks who think leverage and
timing is on their side to take advantage of opportunities as they occur.
