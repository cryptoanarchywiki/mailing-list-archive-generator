Most of the shirts have shipped, with the exception of orders containing 
sizes over XXL. There was a probably with the larger sizes, which has 
been resolved. Those orders (the last remaining) will be shipped out 
sometime this week.

I apologize for any delays, and the time it took to get this together. It 
turned out to be a bigger project than originally anticipated. It's too 
bad I can script a packaging algorithm to handle this, but that's 
real-life for you. :)

If anyone has any questions, comments, gripes, flames, etc, mail me.
