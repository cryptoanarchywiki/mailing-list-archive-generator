WOw.

I have recieved 4 replies in 2 hours.


I propose the following for the list of ID types:

Please incude the date and month of the card issuance, so it can be
included in the list.  Many people have states that let licenses
go for 5 years so outdated information is a problem.

The greatest concerns are the digitized photo, the magnetic strip
and the bar code.  Please include a yes/no for each of these at least.

The type of card (laminated... not laminated... etc) is also helpful.


I'm amazed at the response.

The identity of contributers will not be put on the list, and anonymous
submissions are encouraged.
