Preface:

   I inadvertently sent this via regular mail to Tim directly instead of
   on the list.  He noted, correctly, that it should have been put to the
   list so I'm copying it there.

  Once again, though, if someone is granted anonymity then people can
  not take into account the source unless reputations are attached to
  the pseudonym, as you mention:

  But we are guaranteed the right to face our accusor in legal cases
  which would go away with complete anonymity.

   Ok, so it is not just blind anonymity but rather one with some
   degree of responsibility and reputation, thus your psuedonym becomes
   known as a distinct entity that is not tied to you.  Perhaps...

  And a valid point it is.  It seems that in 50 years we could have
  come up with a better example of limiting freedom than this.
