That's very good of you, Jim, but we non-Americans are quite used to Americans
forgetting that there's something beyond the 50 states ;-)

The thing about Clipper, DT, etc, is of course that though it will affect the
rest of the world (America leads the world into the information society...), 
it *is* hapenning in the US. My signature, that of a non-US citizen, non-US 
resident, on an Anti-Clipper petition to the US congress is not likely to be 
very useful!

Eventually, all of us aim for a world where, to quote Tim's .sig, national
borders are but speed bumps on the information superhighway.
