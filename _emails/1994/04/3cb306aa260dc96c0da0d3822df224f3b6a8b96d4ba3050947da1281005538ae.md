This reminds me of cwb, I think, or else it's cbw (stands for codebreaker's
workbench), that is supposedly a tool for breking crypt-ed text.  I tried
to make this tool work a couple of times, and never got it working.  One
fellow I corresponded with said it worked for him right out of the box.  I
eventually decided that it didn't work for me at least partly because it
was too dependent on the vt220 display.  I never actually ran it on a
vt220.

Did anyone ever do any work to improve cbw (or cwb)?  Everyone is always
saying what a joke crypt is, but I've never been able to crack it with
anything I got on the net.  What do people really use to break (BSD)
crypted text?
