Um, this is pretty paranoid shit.  The source for PGP is freely available 
- and the first thing that was done after it was released was that people 
started looking at the source for exactly the kinds of things that you 
mention.  None were found.

Of course, there *could* be glaring weaknesses in PGP internally -- and 
that's why the NSA chose to allow it to propogate, just like they did DES.
But I don't believe that there was a conspiracy on the part of the author 
of PGP - after all, that's one more person outside of the control of the 
NSA that would know what was going on, and PRZ's anarchistic tendancies 
are well-known :)
