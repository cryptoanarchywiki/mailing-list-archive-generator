Are you being sarcastic here or...?

You seem to think I look upon the above description with fondness and 
adoration.  I do not.

Which deceitful attitude, mine or the federal government's?

I think that's difficult to do and still live in the United States, or 
most nations.

Regardless of how persuasive I find the argument, you do probably benefit 
from the police, fire, emergency rescue, and national defense services 
provided by the government.  You also probably benefit from what 
deterence the civil litigation and criminal processes affords those who 
would do you ill.

While I don't find this justifies the abridgement of the constitution, I 
do think it stifles the argument that one is not willfully participating 
or partaking of soceital benefit.

I think your position is basically "I didn't sign the Constitution, so 
the government has no power over me."  I don't really see a rationale for 
this position, only the position itself.  The clause "but in consent of 
the people" is a collective form of "the people."  I wish it needn't be, but 
it is none-the-less.

Again, I don't know where to go with this.  You give me a position, and 
use it to support your position.

I will say that if I believed a soceity could exist without some minority 
oppression I would reject all regulation.
