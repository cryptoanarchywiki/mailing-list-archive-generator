Of course electrons are quantum mechanical.  Ever hear of electron
diffraction?  Jonsson did Young's double-slit experiment with
electrons in 1961.  How about the scanning tunneling microscope?  In
an STM the electrons tunnel from one place to another, which is
clearly not a classical effect.  Maxwell's equations only describe the
electron classically, which is the whole reason why quantum
electrodynamics is required.  Maxwell's equations hold up with the
introduction of relativity, but not quantum mechanics.
