Gentlemen:

Mr. Mike Watson, who writes an encryption
program named "Enigma 2.2" based on DES
also writes a really nice deletion program
for the Macintosh.  Burn 2.0 is FREEWARE,
and will overwrite with 0's, with 1's,
with random 1's and 0's...even with your
own pattern.  You can also erase all
free space on the HD...and you can choose
the number of passes.  If you want a copy,
I'll be glad to send you one...and, if 
you want me to upload a copy to a site,
please pass on any suggestions.  I don't
know about ITAR restrictions, so I probably
won't go outside the US and Canada;  what
the rest of you do is your biz...

Regards,

Dave
