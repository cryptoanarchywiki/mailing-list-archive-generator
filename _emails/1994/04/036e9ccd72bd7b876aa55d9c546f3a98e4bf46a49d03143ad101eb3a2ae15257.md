I've noticed some discussions of IRC (Internet Relay Chat), both as a possible
model for CP interactions, as well as a location for implementations of 
BlackNet (in #wares, etc.)

Note that IRC, unlike MUDS, has been designed to ensure 'true-names'. While
you do use nicknames, anyone can find out the machine name and user ID you are
logged in from, with a /whois. Anytime you join or leave a channel, your full
machine name and user ID is displayed to everyone, along with your nick. This
is different from any (possibly pseudonymous) e-mail address you register for
incoming mail.

In #wares, people typically trade names of unauthorised FSP sites (such as the
one in the LaMacchia case), which normally remain active for less than a few 
weeks. Though entry to IRC channels can be by invitation only, everyone knows
everyone else's real (in the sense of machine and ID) identity.

Not CP-friendly at all. 

It would be nice to have a #Cypherpunks channel, though... many of us don't 
mind revealing our identities to each other, and it could increase the 
frequency of interactive sessions greatly.
