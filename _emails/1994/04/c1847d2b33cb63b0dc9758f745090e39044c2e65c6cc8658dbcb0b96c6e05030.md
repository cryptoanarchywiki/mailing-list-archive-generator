 As a lifetime Chicago resident, let me add my $.02

 The CHA projects are a Liberal idea gone bad...People confused
solid architectural fact (large buildings can be more cost
efficent) with bad social policy. (these people could effectivly
solve their own problems, and could live together in effective
comunities)

 The idea of sweeps will never work, they'd have to do it a couple
of times a day. I don't even need to go into the
unconstitutionality of the whole process. The whole thing boils
down to trying to use a simple solution to solve a complex problem,
which works for politicians, but no one else.

Besides, Handguns are illegal in Chicago, and have been for more
than a decade.......
