And at this point I've just built an ordinary PRNG+Xor based stream
cipher and the usual techniques to break it all apply.

All this "encryption with chaos" stuff just adds up to "look at my
fancy PRNG", which of course is a game that crypto people have been
playing for a long time. I'm starting to get alarm bells go off every
time "chaos" is mentioned.
