Happens all the time.  As long as the landlord's entry is legal, so is 
the cops'.

Reminds me of when I used to ride public transit through the Presidio, a 
military reservation in San Francisco.  As the bus entered the Presidio, 
I would usually say to whomever I was sitting with, "you are now leaving 
the United States."

When the expressed puzzlement, I would point out a sign that said 
something like:

		You are now entering a military reservation.
		You are subject to search at the discretion
		of military authority.

Now be advised, the bus just passed through the Presidio from one section 
of "Free San Francisco" to another.  Apparently though, the Constitution 
ended at the gate for everyone--including those in transit.
