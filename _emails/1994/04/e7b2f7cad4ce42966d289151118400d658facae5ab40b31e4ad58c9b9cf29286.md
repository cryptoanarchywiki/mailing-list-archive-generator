From tmp:

"what do you think, cpunks, should you have the right to ignore people
regardless of the pseudonyms they use?"

How could a person prevent someone from ignoring another? on the net?


"i ask if it is possible to construct a system that protects anonymity 
but at the same time allows someone to filter all pseudonyms associated 
with another person."

Code it, and they will come.


" ideally we can develop moral codes where our algorithms fail us. "

Ideally, you would be able to enforce these moral codes.
Ideally, they would reflect not only what is possible in reality, but 
what is truly desireable.
