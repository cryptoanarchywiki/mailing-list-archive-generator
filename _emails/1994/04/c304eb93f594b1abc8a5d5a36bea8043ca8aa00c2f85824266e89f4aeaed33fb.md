  perry metzger responds:
  Short of actual references, this remains an urban legend. Even if
  demonstrated, it doesn't necessarily mean anything about the practical
  application of doubling and similar strategies.

Even if someone could come up with references, that *still* doesn't mean
much, since it's a probabilistic argument.  Like buying lottery tickets
-- *someone* has to win, but that doesn't mean that it's reliable enough
to use for any practical purpose.

Think of it this way.  Assume that every year, there are 10,000 people
worldwide who visit a casino with the intention of trying to break the
bank via a Martingale scheme, and they all play even-money bets.  Every
year, just fewer than ten of them should manage to win ten successive
even-money bets, and earn approximately 1000 times their initial bet.
Every hundred years, then, someone should manage to win twenty successive
bets and win a million times her stake, and break the bank, and get her
picture in all the record books, and everyone can cite her.  But that's
literally a one-in-a-million chance.  Hardly what *I*'d call sound financial
planning....
