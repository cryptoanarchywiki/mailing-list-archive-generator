Hey guys, I've just uploaded the WNSTORM program I mentioned in my
post last night to soda...  Again, if there are any other ftp sites
that I should send this to (in the USA of course) let me know.

Also, if you'd like me to mail you a copy let me know. (You must be in the
USA of course, or at least fool me into thinking that you are.)
