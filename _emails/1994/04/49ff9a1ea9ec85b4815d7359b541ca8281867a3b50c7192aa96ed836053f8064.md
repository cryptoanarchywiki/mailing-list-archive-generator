The existence of ATM networks gives the IRS no info that they didn't have 
in, say, 1965 except your physical movements if you use them a lot.  If 
you used to cash or use a lot of checks in the past, they could "follow" 
you that way as well.

What *does* give them (and everyone else) extra powers are the new "voice 
mail" account information systems that use the SS# as a PIN.  Anyone can 
use those to spy on your account.

As always, accounts not in your True Name or in another country are much 
harder to link to you.

In 1985, while he was dying of AIDS, Roy Cohen had almost $1.5 million in 
judgments against him -- half in favor of the IRS and half in favor of 
civilian creditors.  Meanwhile, he lived in an Upper East Side townhouse, 
used a house in the Hamptons, and flew Concorde back and forth to Europe 
frequently.  

Being judgment proof means never having to say you're sorry.
