Sternlight is an idiot educated beyond his intellegence, unworthy of
futher comment, exept to say you're beginning to make an exceptional point.

Well let's hope that the President survives the unlikely event of a 
tactical nuclear detonation or we're all fucked.  While we're on the
subject:

--
Article III, section 3.    

Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war
against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and
comfort.  No person shall be conviced of treason unless on the testimony
of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.

The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but
no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture
except during the life of the person attained.

So if encryption is outlawed, outlaws will get life.

I talked to Federal Reserve President Thomas Hoenig (KC Branch) in an
open public forum yesterday.  I asked him if the Fed was going to let
Clipper encryption cripple US competitiveness in the world monetary
market.

He looked down at his feet and said, "No."

He was very suprised that I was already using public key encryption.  He
knew well the superiority of software encryption.  However, he had never
heard of Phil Zimmerman.  When I elucidated a brief history of PGP, he
agreed that embargoing encryption is tantamount to embargoing wind.

This hand is an economic warfare expert.  He agreed the 4 February policy
decision is economic warfare.  I don't think the Fed is going to let the
NSA severely hobble its ability to wage economic warfare in the world
monetary market.  Digital cash is the Fed's dream.

That's my analysis based on the facts presented and what I saw in the man.
So I think now, more than ever, we really have to stick together.
