	Been reading a bit of Tom Clancy, have we? This ability is 
undoubtedly possible, however, as (presumably) each individual employee 
has their own (individualized) copy, they should realize that some 
creative editing has been done by just comparing notes.
	BTW - this was posted in phreak-45 - so the damage was done quite 
a while ago - look in the papers for mysterious car crashes.
