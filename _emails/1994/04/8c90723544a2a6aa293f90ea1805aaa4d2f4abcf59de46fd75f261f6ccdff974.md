Could someone give me some quick direction on installing  and
running a new remailer.  

Due to system constraints, I've had to rewrite some of the mailer
software, I've tested it, and it seems to operate fine.  

My question is what is necessary, to create an address for the
remailer?  I'd like it addressed as something other than my
personal account.  Do I contact my sysadmins for a new address,
or is this something which is user configurable.

Thanks

BTW:  Do I open up the remailer to the public or do I ask some of
the users of remailers to help me test it prior to a world release.
