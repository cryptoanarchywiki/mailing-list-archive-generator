No, you must be thinking of someone else.  Tim May acts to _strengthen_
government.  Why, just the other day he boasted about _voting_ for them:

In Message-Id: <199404140800.BAA23572@mail.netcom.com> he wrote
"Understand that I actually _voted_ [in a government election]... "

Voting in their elections is right up there with petitioning them or
accepting money from them as their justification for being.  When
they're challenged, they need only point to these constituencies.
