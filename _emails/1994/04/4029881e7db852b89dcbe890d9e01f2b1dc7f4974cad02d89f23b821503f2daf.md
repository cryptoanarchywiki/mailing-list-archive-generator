Remember that Louisiana is one of the few states that allows casino
gambling, and that even there it's limited to gambling boats. There's
probably still a market for a net.casio, provided it offers the following
benefits:
	a) ease of access from remote physical locations (so I can
	   play poker from Alabama or Utah),
	b) easy conversion between casio digicash and a desired

Tim May & others seem to think that money laundering is a small part
of casino business and I tend to agree. Anonymous digicash will
definitely make money laundering easier for small-scale users.
