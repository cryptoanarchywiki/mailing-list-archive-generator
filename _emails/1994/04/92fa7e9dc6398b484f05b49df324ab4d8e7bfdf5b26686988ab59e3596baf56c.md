Likewise "The Incredible Shrinking Company" from THE ECONOMIST of DECEMBER 
15, 1990.  

"Computers were supposed to centralise decision-making and produce
ever, bigger firms. They seem to have done just the opposite

Peering into its crystal ball in 1958, the Harvard Business
Review said that computers would revolutionise American business.
By the end of the 1980s they would ensure that American business
would be concentrated as never before. The economy would be
dominated by a few giant firms. Within each firm important
decisions would be made by a handful of executives with access to
the firm's single, big computer.

The exact opposite has occurred. In America the average number of
employees per firm has been falling since the late 1960s; but
more and more of those employees have a computer on their desk."
