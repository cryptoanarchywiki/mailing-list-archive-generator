I've been reading the "remailer musings" thread, and it
suddenly hit me: why not put the remailer in leo? It probably
wouldn't cost _that_ much, and you might make money from the
digital postage (if it ever comes out). 

And if you were wondering, yes, I came up with this while
thinking about Teledesic. If the wires are going to be in 
the sky, why not the machines?
