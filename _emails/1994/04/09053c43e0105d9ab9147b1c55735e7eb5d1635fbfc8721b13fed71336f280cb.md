Well, since a fair amount of people have been asking for Number Theory
books (including myself, I must admit), I decided to get off my butt, 
and see the major number theorist in this department, Dr. Keith Matthews.
He is a really nice guy, and is always interested in writing and/or
distributing programs for number theory calculations. He even showed me
one of his newest programs, and demostrated it by factoring 2^71 -1 for
me.
	Anyway, I asked him if he had any bibliographies for the subjects
he teaches, and could I post it to the list. Voila! Not only did he have
it printed out on paper, but he also mailed me the relevant LATEX files.
I have decided to remove the LATEX symbols, course codes, class times, etc.,
from the files and just strip it down to the textbook list. Of course, this
is only for a 2nd level subject, but the Library of Congress catalog codes
included should help you look for new books. There are, of course, other 
books on this subject. I hope people find it useful. (If anyone wants the 
original LATEX files, well. . . I've got those too.) So, with Dr. Matthews
kind permission, I present the following refernces:
