At a "Computers, Freedom, and Privacy" '94 informal meeting, I heard a
quick overview of a video-on-demand protocol that would ensure
privacy. Does anyone know the details? Here is what I recall (I think):

Three parties: A - the information provider
                      has a list of movies (or other material) with prices
               B - a middleman/net owner
               C - a customer

Some how, C gets her movie, A gets the money, and A doesn't know who
her customer was, and B doesn't know which movie C is seeing.

Details anyone?

- Carl
