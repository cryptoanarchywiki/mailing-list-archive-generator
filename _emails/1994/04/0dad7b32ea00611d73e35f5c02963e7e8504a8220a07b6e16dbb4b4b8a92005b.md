Just a quick question...and painless at that.

I have available to me an almost complete set of books on Cryptography
from the Aegean Park Press. The question is, are these books worth
reading (there are a whole bunch of them) ? If only particular ones are
noteworthy, which ones are they?

I guess I should have said a couple of questions...
