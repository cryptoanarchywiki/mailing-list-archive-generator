My Apologies!  Mia Culpa!

I've come across a really great
freeware program called burn2.o
for the Mac.  I offered to send it
to anyone who was interested...
two people responded...and I
promptly lost the e-mail addresses.
Please e-mail me and I'll do
better...this is a great little
program!

Regards


Dave
