Seems to me a simpler method would be to start at the end game and work
backward. Start w/ a single piece and it has 64 positions. a game which
ends w/ 2 pieces on the board has 64*63 possible positions, 3 pieces have
64*63*62 possible positions, and so on. The fact is that the end game is what
defines a game of chess and not the infinitude of possible paths between the
first and last move.
