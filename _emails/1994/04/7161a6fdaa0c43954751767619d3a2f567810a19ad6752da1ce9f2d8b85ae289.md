I guess what I was thinking about was a thread in comp.org.eff.talk about
some bogus eff press release that happened some time ago.  My concern is
that I was taken in by this.

Does anyone know if there was an appeal for contributions to a legal
defense fund in that bogus press release?  I didn't follow the thread that
closely, especially after it seemed like it turned into a flame war.

Fifty bucks isn't going to break me, but I would sure feel better if I knew
it went where I thought it was going.  On the other hand I will certainly
feel worse if I find out it didn't.  Maybe ignorance is bliss.
