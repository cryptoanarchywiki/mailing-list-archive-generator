A government official was quoted in today's LA Times as saying
approximately, "I'm sure we can square this with the Fourth
Amendment... this is an emergency situation."
 
   Eli   ebrandt@hmc.edu
 
To which I reply:

Then declare a national emergency and suspend the constitution.

Any emergency not sufficent enough to do this isn't a national emergency.

The only thing that bothers me more than the use of rhetoric like
"The War on Drugs" or "The War on Crime" or "The Health Care CRISIS"
to cover up the fact that rights are being circumvented or outright
eliminated is the willingness of the population to buy into the game.
