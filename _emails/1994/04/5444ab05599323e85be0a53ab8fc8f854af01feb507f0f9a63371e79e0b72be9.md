Attempted translation:  Morality is both individual and situational, and
must not be externally imposed as the imposition would violate individual
sovereignty.

Thanks, Curtis.  For some reason, I kept reading the first sentence as:

"Morality is the ablility to differentiate between right and wrong, 
without detonation."

Which, I guess, would be another good translation.
