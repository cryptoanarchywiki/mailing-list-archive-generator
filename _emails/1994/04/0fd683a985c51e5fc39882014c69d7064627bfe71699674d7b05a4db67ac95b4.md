	Good idea, don't trust anyone, but also don't take everything you 
read seriously, you hath been trolled.

	On another note, those follow-ups from people claiming to be 
Blacknet are probably r0dents form the h/p/w scene who thought it would 
be cool to be k-rad infiltratin data-haven meisters.  IN actuallity the 
Blacknet idea is feesable and I wouldnt doubt if it happens in some 
similiar form in the future, or if it's already happening today.
	TCMay has joined the ranks of Gibson and Sterling with his 
predictive fiction peices now.


	You're eqipped with a hundred billion nueron brain, that's
	wired and fired, and it's a reality generating device, but
	you've got too do it.  Free youself  ----Tim Leary----
