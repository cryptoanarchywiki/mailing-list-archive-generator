I'm not a programmer, but you might write to a LISTSERV site and ask for the
source code for the LISTSERV managing software.  I would assume that you 
would need to make the following modifications:

o  Read the intended user's address from the first line of the message

o  Run the VMS version of a shell script to delete all header information
   above the intended address (like X-Anon-To:cfrye@mason1.gmu.edu)

o  Make the LISTSERV software use that X-Anon-To address as the desination,
   as opposed to a distribution list

o  Destroy all records of the incoming message, which is interesting on a VMS
   account as they are usually kept around for a day (I think?)

OK folks, what am I missing?
