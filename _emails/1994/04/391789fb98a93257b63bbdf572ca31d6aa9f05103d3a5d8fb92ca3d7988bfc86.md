I have something to add here... since the original blacknet message 
release, I have encountered about 7 additional blacknet posts... posts 
presumably not of T.C.May origination. One had to do with some TEMPEST 
monitoring eqip for sale, one claimed to have knowledge of some major 
AT&T exec's sexual preferences, yet another was offering pirated software 
for sale (what a joke!). Each of these posts have had thier own PGP 
public key attached, and a list of acceptable 'pools'. Upon adding each 
key to my key ring, they each claim to belong to 
<BlackNet@nowhere.cyberspace.nil> or whatever (all identicle) but had 
different key id #s and one was even less than 1024bits! (the pirate 
warez key if I remember right...)

My point being, even if Tim didn't originaly intend for it to be a 'real' 
thing, some people have taken it to heart. Hell, if I ever have anything 
shady to buy or sell (me? no, *never*!) I might just roll myself a 
blacknet key and do it that way myself.

On a lighter note, Thanks a billion to everyone who posted a "Blacknet is 
real, man, stay away from them!" message today, I nearly died laughing.

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
