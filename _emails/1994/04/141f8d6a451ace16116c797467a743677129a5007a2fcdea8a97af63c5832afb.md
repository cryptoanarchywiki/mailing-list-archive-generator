Jim has brought up a very interesting subject, which isn't discussed enough in
most of the places I look for such discussion: data inferencing.

A one-shot anonymous ID, besides having the certain immediately obvious
advantages - useful for preserving user anonymity, trouble in the event of
State seizure of the remailer, and lower sysadmin accounting load - makes
traffic analysis a somewhat more difficult affair.

Of course, one-shot anonymous user handles are of little use to the detweilers
of the net, who seem to return to the same places, again and again.  It doesn't
take much acuity to notice things like the use of, oh, say, TeX-format quote
marks in body text, as mentioned in a previous post by Tim May.

I shall, of course, refrain from using smilies to indicate humor.  I dislike
them, and would never use such an unsubtle mechanism to convey wry amusement.
 I prefer textual encoding.  Text is rich.
