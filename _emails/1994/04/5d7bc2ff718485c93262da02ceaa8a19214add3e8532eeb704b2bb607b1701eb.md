Thanks, this sounds like a start, the only question is do I have to have root
capabilities to implement this? Do you know of a LISTSERV site I might contact?

It sounds like you would need only your own account for email access,
though the amount of traffic may attract your sysop's attention :-).
Or, to leave the programming running "resident", you may require  root
priviledges after all.  If there are hooks in the listserv source code
allowing it to fire whenever a new message comes in, you wouldn't.

I'm sorry, it's really late -- I'm trying to say that you probably won't
need root priviledges to set up the remailer if you could have a
daemon-like software agent waiting for the mail to come in.  There, that
wasn't so hard!  <YAWN>

I know that in the UNIX world, users have set up remailers in Netcom
accounts and university accounts without root priviledges.

For a complete list of publically accessible mailing lists, which
includes LISTSERV's, look in the newsgroup news.answers and find the
eight-part posting entitled something like "Guide to Publically
Accessible Mailing Lists".  I used the search term "Mailing List" and
found it after a few tries.  If you don't have access to Netnews, mail
me and I'll get them for you.

One LISTSERV location I know of is news-admin@auvm.american.edu.
Yeah, it's an Internet address, but there should be a human on the other
end.

I wish I could help technically, but I hope this information gets you
started on a successful project.  Don't hesitate to ask if you think I
could help out.

g'night!

Curt
