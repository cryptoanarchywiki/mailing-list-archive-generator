I found something interesting that I have not proven, but it has not 
failed yet:

The integer N is prime if:

   2^N - 2
  ---------
      N              is an integer.

Don't ask how I found it, I was just fooling around.  Now:
   Is there some way to reverse the formula so we can insert and integer 
and get a prime number out?  Let me know, I am over excited.
