For what it's worth, you can de-magnetize anything you want just by going to the 
store. I work at a pharmacy, and they have "inventory control tags" on some of the 
"hotter" items. When someone wants to buy one of these items, we put the tag 
(actually just a magnetized strip) on a special pad that demagnetizes it (and ATM 
and credit cards that are put on it too :))

Also, since I live on a university campus in New Haven, security is a big thing 
here. We now must use ADT keycards as well as physical keys to get into the 
buildings. The first semester they were used, I blitzed three of them just by 
carying it with me all the time. We never found the reason, but I think it has 
something to do with the fact that I'm around computers all day. (Incidentally, 
there were reports of peoples credit cards being wiped by these things as well as 
them setting off theft detectors at record stores).

Just another 0.02 for the pot.....
