For people wanting to get more remailers going there seems to be a serious 
apathy for helping people get them going. After posting that I had come into 
possesion of a VAX account from which I might run a remailer and then asking 
for some help, I got all of ZERO responses (except from people asking me to 
help them if I did manage to get any information). Since I had already checked 
out the available code which only seems to work on UNIX accounts, perhaps 
someone might inform me that one cannot run a remailer from a VMS account. I
assume this is the case since no one deigned to answer. Pretty bogus.
