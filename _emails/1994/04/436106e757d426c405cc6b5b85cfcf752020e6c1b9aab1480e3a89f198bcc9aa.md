1984 NSA T-shirt ordering information:

The shirt will be printed in white ink on a dark colored shirt.  The
shirts are 100% Cotton.  Available sizes are L, XL, and XXL, and available
colors are black, navy, dark green, and maroon. 

The price is $15, which includes postage and handling.  Make your check or 
money order out to "John Blair" and send it to:

1984 T-Shirt
John Blair
210 Mary Lyon
Oxford, OH 45056

Be sure to include the requested size and color, as well as an e-mail 
address for confirmation of the order, and a snail-mail address to send 
the shirt to.  Students: be sure you include an address you will be at 
after May 14.

I must recieve your order by Wed., April 27.  It is possible that there 
will be extra shirts avaiable to people after this date, or a second 
printing run for late orders, but I can only guarentee shirts to orders 
recieved by this day.  Assuming all goes well, I will have the shirts in 
the mail by Sat., May 14.

Thanks to all who have offered suggestions while I was refining the 
design, and for all the un-expected interest.

A reminder: The shirt is available for viewing at
http://phoenix.aps.muohio.edu/users/jdblair/t-shirt.html

This is accesable by Mosaic or Lynx.  Lynx will download gifs of the 
design to your own disk.

It will be available soon via anonymous ftp.  I will post the address 
when that is confirmed.

Thanks again,
-john.
