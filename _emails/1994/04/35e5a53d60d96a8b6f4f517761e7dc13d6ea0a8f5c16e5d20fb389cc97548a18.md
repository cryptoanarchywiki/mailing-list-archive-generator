If the info is on the card, follow the refrigerator magnet idea
if you don't want them to cash your cheque. Or do as the Sarge did.
Then, instead of having a record that you purchased Pentouse Letters
on April 14 at 10:33 pm in Mac's Milk on the corner of Broadway
and 110th, they have a record of your withdrawal of 50 bucks from
the atm and a picture in their video database as you did the
withdrawal. Six of one, half a dozen of the other.

If the info is in the database, and it is (even though _this_
pos terminal may not have access to it) then - well, if you object
to this, keep up with cp and other fora, get yourself some fake
or anonymous id's (?), write code, use pgp, become judgement proof,
move and don't set up forwarding addresses, have your id killed, etc.

What might be really useful is a list of the different measures
used on all the states ID's.

For example:

Maryland uses a magnetic strip, Digitized Photo and a bar code.
All that is printed on a credit card like card and not laminated.
Military ID's are green and white paper with a polaroid and a
signiture, normal lamination.
Illinois is a normal lamination with a complete photo within,
no bar code or strip, no digitized photo record.

Anyone want to further the list?  I wouldn't mind compiling the
information.

What seems key and most attractive to those who are willing to
go through the trouble, is identifying the states that use
limited measures, espeically avoiding the magnetic strip and
digitized photo states, and getting your license(s) in the
states that are "behind the times."
