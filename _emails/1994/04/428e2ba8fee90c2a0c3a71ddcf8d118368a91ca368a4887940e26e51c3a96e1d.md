Dear AT&T:

If you'll roll over for us on Clipper, we will suitably incentivize you.

/s/ The Clinton Administration

I suppose most of us would consider a $4B contract a "suitable
incentive." While there's probably no direct evidence of a quid pro
quo, it strikes me as a bit odd that the President is personally
intervening in a purely commercial deal.

OTOH this is the second time Clinton has intervened in a deal with the
Saudis. On the gripping hand, I don't recall anyone intervening to get
business for Boeing (Peace Shield, the Saudi C3I network), McDonnell
(F-15s), and so on.

Thanks a lot, AT&T.

- -Paul
