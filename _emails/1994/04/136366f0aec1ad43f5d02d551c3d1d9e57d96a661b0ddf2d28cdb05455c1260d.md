Actually, I think it is.  In all casinos that I've heard about, the "bank"
is just an amount that each game is allowed to lose in a given period of
time.  If roulette table #1 has a bank of $10,000 and it loses more than
that amount, the bettor has "broken" the bank.  Whoopdeedoo.  Great for 
casino publicity, but not that big a deal for the casino in the overall 
scheme of things.  It is exactly stories like the one you repeat that 
keep the rubes coming back to the tables.
