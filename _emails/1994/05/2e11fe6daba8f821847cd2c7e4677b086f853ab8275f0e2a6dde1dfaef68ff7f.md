In re Phil Karn's comment that Stuart Baker was an asshole.  Perhaps
he was just being one for pay? (see below):

   Newsgroups: alt.wired
   From: brian@tired.wired.com (Brian Behlendorf)

   Finally, the article by Baker was almost word-for-word the same pitch
   he had given at CFP and other places he's had the opportunity to
   speak.  

   I wonder if his recent resignation from the NSA has anything to do with
   this...
