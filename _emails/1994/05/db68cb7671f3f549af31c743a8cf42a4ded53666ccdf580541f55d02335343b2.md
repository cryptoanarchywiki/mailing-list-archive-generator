	Can you say Clipper boys and girls?  I thought you could.

	Yeah, and so do guns, and police scanners, and cars, and hatchets,
	and every other tool we use!  Legislating tools won't work.  You 
	can only somewhat-successfully legislate the improper use of them.

	 If they did that people would use words like messenger or devastator
	 instead of missile and bomb.  "Like Duh!"
