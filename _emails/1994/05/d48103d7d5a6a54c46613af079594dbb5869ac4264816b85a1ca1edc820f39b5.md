Certainly the use of an anonymous remailer in and of itself it doesn't make
one either a coward or a hypocrite.  However, invading someone's privacy by
posting their telephone number and home address is a hypocritical act for
anyone who expects others to respect their own privacy.  Moreover, doing so
anonymously is cowardly.

And, yes, my using my long-standing nickname, "Lefty", is _quite_ different
from posting anonymously.  You can reply directly to me using my email
address, <lefty@apple.com>, which appears in the header of everything I
post; moreover, I am responsible for what I post using that ID.

See it up there?  You can easily determine who I am from that information.

<lefty@apple.com> is, in effect, a True Name.  <nowhere@bsu-cs.toad.com> is
not.  <nobody@jarthur.cs.hmc.edu> is not.

It is not the case that anybody "pointed out a privacy lapse" here.  On the
contrary, someone _committed_ a privacy lapse by obtaining and posting Mr.
Nalbandian's phone number and address _specifically_ as an incitement for
people to harass him.  This _is_ an invasion of privacy.  Are you somehow
failing to see that?

>For example, would you object to this:
>
>an4544@anon.penet.fi  = Eric Robison <ericr@Solbourne.com>
>an68863@anon.penet.fi = Derek M. Harkins <harkinsd@solix.fiu.edu>

What you have supplied represents an invasion of privacy as well, in my
opinion.  If you were to explain how you came by this information, _that_
might be worth sharing, but simply presenting a mapping of anonyms to
truenyms is not.
