Subject: Barlow Liberty Essay Airs on PBS Tomorrow Night

Folks,

I commend to your attention a video essay on Liberty which I did for PBS
last summer. It will air tomorrow May 17 at 10:00 PM EST (your listings may
vary) as part of a program called Declarations.

Could I please persuade those of you who re-post to put this in any
places where there might be people interested? Thanks much.

Enduring,

Barlow

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
