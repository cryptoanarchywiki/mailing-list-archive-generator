    ECASH WITH OFFSHORE BANK CLEARING HOUSE

   Well Chaum's ecash doesn't seem to be quite the Holy Grail that it
looked like. It needs a clearing house to be effective. Would an off-
shore bank acting as a clearing house for Chaum's ecash be practical?
Could that be a State Killer?
                                        Yours Truly,
                                        Gary Jeffers
