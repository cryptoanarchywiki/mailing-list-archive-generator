Well... maybe if it was one of those stereographic pictures, it would
be a little bit easier. You just have to get your eyes in focus (and
that's a bit hard for some people). Pling! You suddenly discover the
hidden message, like "HITLER IS ALIVE AND LIVING IN ARGENTINA!" or
some other related message. It's in 3-D, so the letters appear to be
5 mm tall! (Reminds me of when Jaws III was out at the cinema. :-))
Of course, you might have to print it out first. 

Sorry, just me being silly.
