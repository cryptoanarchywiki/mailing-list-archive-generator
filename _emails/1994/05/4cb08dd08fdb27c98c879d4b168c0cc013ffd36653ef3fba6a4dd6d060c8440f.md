Seth Lloyd has an interesting paper, "A Potentially Realizable
Quantum Computer", available at ftp.santafe.edu (I don't know 
the exact path).  It is based on a cellular automata material
that receives pulsed/phased array strobing light.  It uses
reversible logic so it dissipates little energy.  As I understand
the proposal assumes future materials and manufacturing abilities, 
although Lloyd says that quantum dots may be the right direction.

As gtoal mentions, the P vs. NP question is speculative.  My 
intuition is that the many worlds hypothesis will not be a 
holy grail of computation (because similar theories about
faster than light communcation ended up not being useable
due to very low level conservation rules).

Then again, we may be surprised.
