I'm afraid I have to disagree.
 
I dislike the limiting of key length to 1024 bits and would encourage a 
fix to at least the 1200's range.
 
Unfortunately I don't know enough about RSAREF to know what this involves 
but it seems a step backwards to limit key length to this size especially 
with the recent advances in processing on the retail market (powerpc 
pentium etc.)  To me this makes 2.5 a real loser.
 
More and more 2.5 looks like a restriction on choice.

No keys over 1024 bits.
No use of servers for the older versions.

I don't use a 1200 bit key now, but I'd like the option.  Calling the 
limitation a mere backwards compatibility problem shortcuts the issue.  I 
wouldn't care less if I used a 1200 bit key or a 2048 bit key today and 
had to make a new one for the new version.  I would care if I used a 1200 
or 2048 bit key today and had to make a 1024 bit one.

I don't want to be paranoid, but why the restriction?  Who does it 
serve?   Definitely not the user.  What modifications are possible?  What 
are the restrictions on modification to code in the licensing agreement?

Fine, how about satisfactory for serious users?
