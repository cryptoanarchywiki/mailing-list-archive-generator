If people feel this way, they are confused.  Once the code escapes the
U.S. it is legal to use, modulo local anti-privacy legislation.  Someone
exporting the code from the U.S. takes a legal risk; someone who uses
already-exported code does not.

Snarf it from ghost.dsi.unimi.it, as cautiously as you like.
(Oh, actually, the ftp site has moved to goblin.something -- it will
