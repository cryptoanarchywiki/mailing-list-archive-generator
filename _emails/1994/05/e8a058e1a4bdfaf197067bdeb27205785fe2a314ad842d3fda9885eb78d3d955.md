When I thought back to where I was during Woodstock, I remembered that it
took place in the summer.  The only ones doing homework would have been
those in summer school, not the nerds.  Personally, I had just graduated
from high school.

A guy I was working with invited me to go with him to Woodstock, on the
Thursday before the big weekend, but I didn't know what he was talking
about.  He was going with a bunch of people in a semi trailer.

He never came back to work.  At least, not that summer.  I've often
wondered what would have happened if I had accepted his offer.  But you
didn't have to go to Woodstock to do LSD.  There was plenty of it in
Cleveland in 1969.  (Still is, from what I hear).

However, I wasn't doing trig homework.  I was assembling vacuum cleaners.
