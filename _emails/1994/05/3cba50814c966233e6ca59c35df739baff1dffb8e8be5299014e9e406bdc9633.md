In an agreement between The Phantom Exchange and UniBank, we are proud 
to announce the opening of a digital currency server and exchange 
service at unicorn@access.digex.net.
 
UniBank will begin circulating DigiFrancs at 1:38pm EST Tuesday May 10, 
1994.  (The moment of peak coverage in the annular eclipse of the sun)
 
DigiFrancs are backed by 10 cases of Diet Coke, located at the UniBank 
"vault" reserves in Washington, DC.  DigiFrancs are redeemable for their 
equivalent value in 16 oz Diet Coke cans (unchilled) on demand FAS 
Washington, DC.  This arrangement implies no agreement between any of 
the parties and Coca-Cola company.
 
The Phantom Exchange and UniBank have launched a cooperative effort to 
exchange information and establish realistic floating rates of exchange 
between our two currencies.  As a result PhantomMarks and DigiFrancs 
will be freely interchangeable at the spot rate.  Exchange rates will 
also be offered for Tacky Tokens from mpd@netcom.com's digital bank.  
Tacky Tokens are exchangeable at UniBank at the current rate subject to 
some restrictions.
 
No exchange fees will be assigned for the month of May.
 
Current rates of exchange are available via finger at 
unicorn@access.digex.net.
