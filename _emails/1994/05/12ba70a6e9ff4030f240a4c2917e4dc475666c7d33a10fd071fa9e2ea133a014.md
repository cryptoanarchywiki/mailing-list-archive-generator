   Someone who's had dealings with the NSA and State over these issues
   saw some memos, but was not allowed to make copies of them, which
   indicated that State's lawyer's were very concerned that an ITAR case
   involving software *not* ever reach the courts, because they felt the
   government's case was very weak and that a probable loss would be a
   serious setback in other areas.

Is there any chance that these memos would be subject to release under
the FOIA?
