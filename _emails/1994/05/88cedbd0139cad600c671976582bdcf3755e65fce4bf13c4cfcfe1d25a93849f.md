Obviously the rest of the world is not going to accept a 
standard crippled for the convenience of any one government.

If 2.6 is deliberately incompatible, I predict that it will
fail.  Remember how IBM failed when it tried to change
the PC standard.  Remember the great Apple III flop.

In the unlikely event that "Cypherpunks write code"
then cypherpunks will control the standard.   It really
is that easy.i

Standards are set by good products, not by governments or big
companies..
