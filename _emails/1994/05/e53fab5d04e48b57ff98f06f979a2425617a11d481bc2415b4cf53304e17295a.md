Many sites don't do put in an X-Authorization-Warning. At least one site
I know allows you to fake a sitename with helo.

Right. But "they" were not an auto moderation script. Remember the context 
we're discussing this issue...

Again, the context is auto-moderation of _open_ mailing lists (such as this 
one). I doubt that you'd want to restrict posts, approving or disapproving 
replies to "registered" members. The point is not to censor Nalbandian or
Detweiler. There may be some fans out there, and IAC the _reader_ should decide
what to look at. The point is to make this decision easier, with friendly 
advice from the poor souls who actually _read_ all the crap.
