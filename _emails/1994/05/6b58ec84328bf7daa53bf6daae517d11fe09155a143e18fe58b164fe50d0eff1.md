One of (Michael) "Swaine's Flames" in a recent Dr. Dobb's had this 
angle.  It was an imaginary trial about a government-mandated
anti-virus-virus.

I'm not sure the unwashed will be wildly enthusiastic about this idea,
but then they did seem to be against Clipper in that Newsweek poll.
In any case it's a good principle: people and businesses shouldn't
be required or even asked to install government peacekeeping or
law-enforcing equipment in their homes.  It also applies to the 
proposals that telephone companies be required to put provisions for 
wiretaps into their equipment.
