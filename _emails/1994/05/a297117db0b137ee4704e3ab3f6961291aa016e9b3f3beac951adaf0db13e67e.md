	 This is one of the main
	 reasons behind such publications as the IBM Technical Journal--the
	 publication of results not worth patenting themselves, but definitely
	 worth preventing others from patenting.

Actually, no.  IBM has a separate publication for just that purpose.
The Technicnal Journal (and others like it) are intended as PR vehicles
and as gold stars for researchers -- that's an important part of our
salary, as it were.
