Yes, well, uh... If they already have all that information, would it *not* be
wonderful if they suggested what your return could look like? I know that *I*
really hate it everytime some agency (including income tax folk) sends me a
pile of forms that I have to fill in with information they mostly already have.

Or am I missing something?
