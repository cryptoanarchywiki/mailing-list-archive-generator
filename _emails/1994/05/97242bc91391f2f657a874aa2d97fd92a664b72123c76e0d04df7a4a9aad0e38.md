If anyone is interested, this is how it is done here in Sweden today. Almost,
anyway. You get a single paper where you put an X in the square which
says 'The reports that I've got (from your employer, bank etc.) are
correct' and then you sign it at the bottom. That's it.

Is this what you are afraid of? It most probably *will* happen to you.

(There are ofcourse exceptions to this, if you have a business, or
have income from other sources etc.) The fact is, though, that the
majority of us do use this simplified tax return.
