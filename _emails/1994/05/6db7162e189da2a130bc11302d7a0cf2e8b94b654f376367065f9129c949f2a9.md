Not if you're referring to some form of "PGP:ng" or otherwise similar
software that can interrogate and support several possible public key
algorithms. The ASN.1 encoded PKCS packets are deliberately designed
with algorithmic identifiers so that "smart" software can entertain not
just RSA, but say El-Gamal or DSA algorithms -- in fact, anything you
car to devise. The same applies to symmetric encryption and signature
packets.

One could piss off RSA entirely and go with DSA, whose only
disadvantage being ciphertext doubling is so trivial it doesn't warrant
a mention.
