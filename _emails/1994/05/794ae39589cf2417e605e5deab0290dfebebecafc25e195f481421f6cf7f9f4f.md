Not completely fungible.  There is also trust in the trustee as a
trustee, who could abscond with the whole sum suddenly.  

This point is extremely important.  The difference between "your
receipts" and someone else's means that you don't have a completely
fungible system.

It appears that you have 100% reserves, from the phrase _pari pasu_.
