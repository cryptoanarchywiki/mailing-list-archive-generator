Paranoia certainly got a boost here, though, by the recent and still
unexplained emptying of the subscriber list.  Was this actually, as many
have speculated, a malicious action by someone taking advantage of the
majordomo software, or was there a more prosaic explanation?  Or is there
no way for even the list managers to know?

Clear information is one of the best ways to dispell paranoia.
