	Thus is seems that all freedom loving individuals will be
forced to use version 2.5, which came with no such bone-headed
restrictions.

	Too bad the RSA license included in 2.5 was specifically
perpetual.  There was also no limitation that I saw on redistributing
2.5, except in regards to possible ITAR violations.
