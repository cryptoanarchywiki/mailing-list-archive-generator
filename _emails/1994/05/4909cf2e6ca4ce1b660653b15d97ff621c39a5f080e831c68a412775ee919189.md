Greetings C'punks:

Normally I'm just a lurker here on cypherpunks, but I thought that the 
new net.cop mode might be of interest to us all.

Here are the results of Mr. Sternlight's assiduous policing:

In tracking down slow response on netcom8, I discovered that user beker was
idle for over 16 minutes, and since the timeout was supposed to be 12, I
fingered him to see if he was a netcom staffer.

I found his .plan file contained a PGP 2.3a key. That infringes RSADSI's
patents. That this is so has recently been confirmed by an independent
inquiry by lawyers retained by MIT.

The patent holder, RSADSI, has said that no only do versions of PGP except the
soon-to-be-released 2.6 and the commercially sold Viacrypt version 2.4
infringe in the U.S., but posted keys and key servers constitute inducement
to infringe and/or conspiracy to infringe.

Given netcom's new user agreement, I'm user user beker will want to correct
this.

David
