	 There were no disk drives in WWII. There were barely computers. Hell,
	 there was barely magnetic audio storage -- on steel wire!

I sent the same reply privately.  But disks were used in a WWII voice
security system -- phonograph disks...

I just learned about this system a few weeks ago.  As anyone who has
read Kahn knows, the early secure voice systems weren't secure; trained
listeners could even understand the scrambled system.  Some folks at
Bell Labs were asked to design one that would work.

The eventual system -- known as SIGSALY, or as Project X (and the
end units were called X terminals, which is probably the only time
that phrase was ever used for something that is secure...) -- utilized
a vocoder and a one-time pad.  The one-time pad was recorded on two
high-quality phonograph records, each of which held 15 minutes of
keying information.

SIGSALY terminals were quite large -- they took up 30 seven-foot bays.
And they needed a *lot* of air conditioning.  But the system did work,
even over transoceanic radio links.  Churchill had one in his underground
office in London, in fact.
