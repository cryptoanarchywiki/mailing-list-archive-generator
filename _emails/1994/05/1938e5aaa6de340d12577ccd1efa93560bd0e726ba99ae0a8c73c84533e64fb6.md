AP reported on 5/20/94:

>The federal government will begin using computer-generated
>signatures to verify the identities of people submitting bids, 
>contracts and other information electronically.  [...]
>   It is up to people outside the government to decide whether 
>they want to use the standard, which produces the electronic signature. 
>Government agencies that currently use some other method of electronic 
>verification will have to switch to the new standard on Dec. 1, said 
>Miles Smid, manager of security and technology for the institutes.  
>[...]
>
>[The standard employs]  a 320-bit number that makes up the 
>electronic signature. The government computer then compares
>the signature against the person's public key, which would be stored in 
>a government database.
