Are we ever going to be told the details of the deals previously alluded
to regarding keyservers and PGP 2.5 (and now presumably also PGP 2.6)?
I grow more and more curious.

If users inside the USA take to using PGP 2.6 then users outside the
USA will, by fair means or foul, have to obtain PGP 2.6 (or at least
enough technical data to enable them to independently implement the
relevant algorithms).  Failing that, they will have to live with the
inability to read messages from PGP 2.6 users inside the USA.  Sigh.  I
wonder whether anybody is deliberately fostering a split between USA and
non-USA users of PGP.
