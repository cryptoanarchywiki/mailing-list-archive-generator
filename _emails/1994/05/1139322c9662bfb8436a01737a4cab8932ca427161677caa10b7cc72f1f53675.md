	Before I say anything, I'd like to commend you on the work
you've done with Magic Money so far.

	But this isn't automatic.
	It doesn't make the communication with the server
automatic. People have wondered why no one is using their magic money
bank-- it's because it is *SLOW* and a *pain in the ass* to use!
(That's why I'm not using 'em at least.) You have to mail a request
in, and then wait for a reply, and then run it through the client
again...

To remedy this problem, I have written code.

	I have written a wrapper for the server which allows it to sit
on any internet port waiting for messages. I have written a client
which is not as functional as the one you have described below, but it
automates all communication with the server. When you have incoming
money, you just run the client on the incoming money, and the client
communicates with the server, the client takes the output of the
server, and processes it, all with *1* user command. That's
automation.

	It could use improvement, no doubt. I posted an earlier
version to the list. I'll make it available on the soda-ftp site.
