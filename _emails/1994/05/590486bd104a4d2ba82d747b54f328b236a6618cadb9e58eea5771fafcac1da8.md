Personally, I'm very, very distressed by reports like this.

As far as I'm concerned, no FBI agent will _ever_ be "invited" to "roam"
around MY systems.  In fact, they'll have to tie me down, beat me with
rubber hoses and put electrodes on my private parts to get anything out of
me beyond my name, job title and PGP fingerprint (and that's WITH a very
specific warrant and clear explanation of what they intend to do).

FYI, I post the following message prominently on my systems when they boot:

>> Govt Agents: All HD files are encrypted.
>> Permission to monitor is denied by Title 18 USC 2511 & 2703.

I'm not sure *exactly* what legal protection this entitles me to, but I
(perhaps foolishly) at least _feel_ better when I see that screen come up
before a system asks for the password to continue booting/mounting volumes.

If one of us has the text of those particular passages in the USC, or the
ftp site where they reside, I would be interested in fetching and reading
the specific text and posting it for all my users to read.

I wonder if:
[1] connected.com users have been made aware of this "invitation"
[2] they intend to remain after the staff has done this
[3] anything illegal was in fact discovered and WHERE
[4] the FBI has followed up on anything they discovered

I hope you keep us informed about this, Jim...
