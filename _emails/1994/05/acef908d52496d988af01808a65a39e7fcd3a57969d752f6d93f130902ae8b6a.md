Here's a form letter I expect to send to people who I see asking about
the status of the list. If someone has better information than I have,
I'll be happy to use it, or to let someone else handle responses.


THIS IS A FORM LETTER (to save me having to type the same stuff)

You have asked what happened to the Cypherpunks list.

I don't know, but as of Sunday night, 8 May, there were only about a
dozen or so subscribers. Apparently something happened to the list. I
have messages in to Eric Hughes and Hugh Daniel.

The subscriber list may get restored. I don't know.

You can also resubscribe by sending a message to majordomo@toad.com
with this as the body:

subscribe cypherpunks

If this is successful, you'll get a confirmation message within a few
minutes.

Volume is likely to be low, until things get back to normal.

I hope this helps.

--Tim May, not acting officially on behalf of the list.
