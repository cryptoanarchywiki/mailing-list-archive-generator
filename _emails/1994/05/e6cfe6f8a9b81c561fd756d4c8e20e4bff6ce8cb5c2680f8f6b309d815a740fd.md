Hmm... This version of the RSAREF 2.0 licence agreement did not have the 
definition of published interface that was included in later 
versions. (e.g. April 15, 1994) 

In particular, if you interpret "published interface" to be "all the 
routines one can call from an unmodified version of RSAREF 2.0", you 
would probably be able to build a version of PGP based on these. 

Here are some extracts from the March 16 1994 licence agreement

My bet is that this involves some legal funny stuff with this version 
of the licence agreement. Another possibility is that PGP 2.5 will 
use triple DES. 

All just speculation. I don't have any inside information.
