As do we.  I can vote on those; it's just that anarchists don't run primary
candidates.  Or regular election candidates, for that matter.

You can't tell the players if you don't read the program.

In case anyone's been wondering, I vote a straight "None of the Above"
ticket.  Every election.  I happen to believe that if you don't punch holes
in your cards (we don't have those big, fun voting booths here in
California like they do back East), you have no right to complain.
