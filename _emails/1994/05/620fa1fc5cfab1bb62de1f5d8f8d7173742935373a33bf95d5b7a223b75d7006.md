A little skepticism is in order.  The story reeks of PR, most likely by
Israeli counter-intelligence.  It appears to threaten (in a nice way)
the civilian leadership. 

I would suspect the facts as being inflated, the private eyes a convenient
cover for the desired message.

I read it as some sort of blackmail by Israeli secret police.
