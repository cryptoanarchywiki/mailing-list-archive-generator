Any place that handles Western Union Money Transfers (one in every town at
least) will also sell the new Western Union Phone card ($5-$50
denominations).  Call an 800# punch the codes on the card in and get a

women (and non Commonwealth citizens) were excluded from same?  Sounds like a
racist, sexist, bigoted, and (for all we know) homophobic act to me."
