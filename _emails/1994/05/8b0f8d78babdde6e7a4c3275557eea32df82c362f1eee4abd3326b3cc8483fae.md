Great. I've just distributed an initial amount of cash; the money supply 
is around 70gm or so. Transactions (in the two days since conception) have 
been so-so. I've had two transactions personally -- one for consulting on 
html pages and one incentive for a key-signing. I'm about to begin 
offering services to further back my currency. 

I'm doing all of the transactions by hand, but if the traffic becomes 
heavy, I'll begin automating the process on one of our unix machines.

I'd like a pointer to this, as would a few of the people on the list (I 
can't name any names). I'll contact mpd.

many thanks for your software.

PS: how about a different message besides "Bad RSA packet" when receiving

dozen times I saw it. :)
