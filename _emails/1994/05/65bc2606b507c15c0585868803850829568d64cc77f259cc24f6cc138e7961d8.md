In the news:

A judge has dismissed drug charges against a daughter of Rep.
Dan Rostenkowski, saying police had conducted an illegal search.  

...police found a gram of cocaine in her car.  

... On Thursday, Criminal Court Judge Michael Toomin ruled that 
the officers didn't have probable cause to conduct the search. 


*EXCUSE ME!*  Since when have the cops and judges cared about legality
of searches?  Am I confused?  Wasn't Bill in Chicago two weeks ago 
explaining why we needed to do illegal searches to root out drugs?
Oh, I forgot.  He meant the searches for *US*.  Not *THEM*.
