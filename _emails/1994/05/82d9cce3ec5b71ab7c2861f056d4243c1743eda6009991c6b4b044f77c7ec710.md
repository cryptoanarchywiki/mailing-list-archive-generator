[This note was written in response to a note from Black Unicorn to me.
He suggested at the end that I could copy the Cypherpunks list on it,
so I have done so. However, I've deleted some of his points, and since
he did not post his note to the list, some context may be unclear.
That's life.]

I'm responding, but only to a few points. Thanks for your comments. 

I won't repeat my points, so no comment just means that.

Feel free to post your response (what I'm replying to here) to the
list as a whole. Yes, it's long. But it's of more relevance to our
world than most of the stuff that gets posted, especially the endless
forwardings of Chaum's announcement, for example.

Maybe yes, maybe no. I have no hesitation in advocating the collapse
of central governments, as you know. Central governments of both the
left and the right have killed hundreds of millions of people, so the
"dangers" of anarchy look comparatively mild to me.

Of course we all know who he is, for many reasons.

If enough people know that Black Unicorn = Fritz Foobar, then the
linkage can be made and the "damage" done. As others have said, you
apparently have some uptight customers. That's not my problem, or
anyone else's who makes the normal kind of comments on the Net. (Tmp
goes beyond normal, but if your lawsuit was centered around the
"damages" aspect, then potentially nearly any of our opinions could be
"damaging" because of your overly sensitive European customers. That's
not right.)

I'd say you have some sleazy friends, then. For them to fax off copies
of what they think of as rants is bad enough, but for one of your
contacts to then "alert" the others is mind-boggling.

Tmp was just using a label. I'll admit the semi-forgery was not
kosher, though these semi-forgeries are transparent to anyone who
looks at the headers.

But calling you an anarchist bent on the destruction of nations is
acceptable characterization in a political debate. If I say Bill
Clinton wants to destroy the health care system, this is normal
political rhetoric. If Detweiler calls me a Satanist, so what?

("What if your customers were Moral Majority Christians?" you might
ask. Then I'd say that all one has to do is tell one's customers the
truth. Under no circumstances can the 'damage" caused by tmp's kind of
free spech be considered assault. I'm a free speech absolutist. That
the comments tmp made came in a heated forum for such political debate
makes it all the more wrong for a lawsuit.)

Even if they do, so what? Not to sound angry here, but suppose I
speculated that Black Unicorn = Fritz Foobar? Would the "damage" that
ensued be my fault? I just don't get it.

That the Cypherpunks list is not public--except when it gets gatewayed
to Usenet, as has happened a few times--is little protection. If I
cite your views--but don't quote them verbatim--in a forum where your
Swiss customers see them somehwo, have *I* committed a crime or tort?

Not in my view, though the law may think so. (I still say it's free
speech, even if "damaging." Many things are damaging...negative book
reviews, unflattering opinions, etc. Sadly, the American legal sytem
is moving toward allowing these "damages" to be the basis for suits.)

The proper and normal response to accusatory rants is to answer them. 

Are you calling for limits on "accusatory rants"? The Founding Fathers
would not be amused.

I think your reputation would have no lasting damage done to it by
ordinary speech. Even so, Detweiler's rants are clearly broad-brushed
insults, which courts should not regulate.

Your uptight Swiss clients should be taught not be believe everything
they read. 

> 
> A settlement is vindication enough in my case.
> 

Except that Detweiler's "apology" was obvious satire, almost identical
to the "apology" he posted to the Cypherpunks last December. He is
likely now planning a much more massive assault on you and his other
perceived enemies....a campaign of fabricating quotes, arguing with
himself via different pseudonyms, etc.

And now that he knows your uptight Swiss customers are so sensitive, he
will probably try to find ways to let them know about your "anarchist"
leanings. 

If he's as smart as I think he is, he'll use the network of remailers.
He'll also try to fabricate quotes that make you seem like a truly
vicious money launderer, perhaps with insinuations that your furniture
business is a cover for drug trafficking. (If I were Detweiler,
licking my wounds, plotting revenge, that's what I'd do.)

If this happens, as I predict it will, your recourse will be to either
try to force the remailer operators to produce the logs (so you'll
have somebody to sue), to sue the remailer operators per se (which
will become a test of common carriage, unless they back down),
or--best of all--to tell your Swiss customers that bizarre rants are
the outcome of a society which tolerates free speeech and that they
should ignore all posts allegedly written by you unless the posts are
coming from your site, or, better, have been digitally signed by you.

As Nat Henthoff says, "sunlight is the best disinfectant."

OK, I just saw your last paragraph as I was wrapping this up. I'll add
the Cypherpunks list to the distribution. It may be long, but these
issues are at least as important as much of what gets posted.
