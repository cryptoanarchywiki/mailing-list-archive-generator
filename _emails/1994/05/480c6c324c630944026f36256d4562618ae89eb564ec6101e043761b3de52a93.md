So has 2.6, actually ;^)

The ITAR is really not workable; we fight it to make legitimate what happens
anyway - whenever any new 'munition' is released, it appears magically on
the major crypto sites in Finland and Italy. 

As no one would dare risk the wrath of the National Surveillance Agency by
fsp upload, how do they do it? Telepathy? Does export by telepathy violate ITAR?
