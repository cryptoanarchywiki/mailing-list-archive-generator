	I know that the source for PGP 2.5 has been released for beta
testing. I have been unable to get it yet [the server is really busy, as
is NetAccess, so I time out. =( ] I also never saw the majority of the
cypherpunk messages for the past five days due to Net Access's internet
feed dying. Can someone please update me on the modifications to PGP v2.5
and the reasons why they are being made via private email (ie remove the list
from the Cc: line). I gather that in the code as published you cant
generate keys bigger than 1024 bits, but that's all I know. Thanks in advance.
