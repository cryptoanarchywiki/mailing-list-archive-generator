There's also a good interview in May '94 *Upside* with Gilder.  "Upside" bills
itself as "The Business Magazine for the Technology Elite", and is not a bad
deal even for the $4.95 cover price (its primary competitor seems to be the
$14.95 *Red Herring*, another technology-sector business magazine aimed at
investors).

I'm reading his 1989 bestseller "Microcosm": pick it up if you can find it.
It's excellent.  Gilder is a rare economist.  He doesn't simply put forth solid
free market arguments.  He doesn't simply jump on the technology bandwagon.  He
knows science, and tells a whopping good story.  For instance: I hadn't known
that Andrew Grove (Intel CEO) was Hungarian, and had escaped Communist rule by
crawling through the mud into Austria.  America is full of incredible success
stories.

"Fibersphere" is his latest, in which he makes his controversial "death of
television" and "dark fiber" arguments.  I've only read excerpts in other
Forbes articles, but it looks worth picking up.

There was a long article in April 11, 1994 Forbes: "AUCTIONING THE
AIRWAYS", by George Gilder". It had a supprising amount of technical
information about a new technology similar to spread spectrum. The article
has a "too cheep to meter" flavor that I do not agree with but it does
present some interesting information and ideas.

It is about 43k bytes and is available via anonymous ftp at
