From Black Unicorn:

If I say :  "The moron who bought RJR Nabisco is a Nazi," I have refered to
no specific person, but the meaning is clear.

Similarly if I refer to the "dolt who posts as tom jones is a Nazi" I am
liable.
......................................

This means that there are a lot of credulous people out there.
I wonder what would happen if I was to say:  "Santa Claus is coming to town."
The consequences are predictable.

Blanc
