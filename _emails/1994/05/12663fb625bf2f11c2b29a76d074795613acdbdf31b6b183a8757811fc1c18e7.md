The Competitive Enterprise Institute is pleased to announce:

                THE VIRTUAL HAND

                CEI'S FREE-MARKET GUIDE TO THE
                INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY

Now, under one cover, all the Internet places of interest to
free-marketeers.  Do you want to find the complete electronic text of
"The Wealth of Nations"?  How many places can *you* list where you can
discuss the words of Ayn Rand?  (The Virtual Hand can name five.)  Do you
want to know the latest in conservative or libertarian politics, or would
you rather sit around griping about gun control?

All this -- and more! -- is available from the Competitive Enterprise
Institute.


        TABLE OF CONTENTS
        1. Policy chatter (mainly Republican and Libertarian politics)
        2. Cultural and philosophical (Objectivism, free-market literary
           journals, "fan" newsgroups, electronic books)
        3. Student-oriented (college groups)
        4. Single-issue forums (taxes, land rights, firearms,
           telecommunications policy, education, health care, feminism,
           law, Congressional reform, kids' rights)
        5. Of local interest (statewide free-market groups)
        6. Internet addresses of free-market groups
        7. Miscellaneous
        8. Other computer systems (BBS'es)
        9. Government resources (how to get White House press releases,
           text of legislation, Federal Register, C-SPAN schedules, etc.)
