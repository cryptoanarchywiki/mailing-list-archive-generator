I dunno. The paper by LaMacchia and Odlysko on how to break
Diffie-Hellman quickly once you've done a lot of precomputation on a
static modulus is sufficiently disturbing to me that I would prefer to
be able to change modulii fairly frequently if possible. If the
opponent knows a way thats a constant factor of a few tens of
thousands cheaper to do discrete logs, it might be worth their while
to spend a large sum on doing that precomputation once in the hopes of
breaking lots of traffic.

Of what sort?

It is BELIEVED dependent -- lets be precise...
