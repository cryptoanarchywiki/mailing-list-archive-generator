Various people, on Unicorn's suit:

Hee hee. True, Detweiler (who's not tmp, of course) has often been accused of
being 'ill' -- meaning mentally deranged. I doubt that he'd agree, though ;-)

Shakespeare?? Not Moses... ;-)

As I said earlier:

> 
> Unfortunately our society is far from ideal. Though Unicorn could freely post

> world.
> 
> For all we may talk about reputation systems, multiple identities and so on,
> the seven-digit possible loss Unicorn talks about is _real_, in a way 
> cyberspace and lost net.reputations just aren't, yet.
