This is very far of topic, and I promise not to make any
further postings on this thread, but:

It is unreasonable to call Hitler a right wing Statist.  He was 
a socialist, and the radical left had very mixed feelings about him
and vigorously opposed US action against him,
until he made war on Stalin.

Franco and Pinochet can reasonably be called right wing statists

I would say there is a substantial difference between right wing
and left wing statists.  The right wingers, being conservative,
do not change things so drastically, and so are less inclined
to wreak havok than the left wing statists.

I would rather have king log than king stork any day.
