I haven't delved into the wide world of remailers out there, but I'd like a
remailer that encrypted, though did not necessarily anonymize, incoming mail.

I'm not really bothered about the NSA reading my mail. In fact, I'm not usually
concerned whether someone in New York, for instance read my mail. But I might
not want people closer to home (local sysadmins, etc) to read it. I'm sure many
others share this position.

The problem is that I can't ensure that people encrypt their mail to me. They
may not bother, or be unable. An alternative would be for them to send it to
a remailer, which, knowing my public key, would encrypt and forward it to me.

Comments?
