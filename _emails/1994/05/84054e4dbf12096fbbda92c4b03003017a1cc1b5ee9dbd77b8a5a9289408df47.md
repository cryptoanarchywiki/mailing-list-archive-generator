C'punks,

On Tue, 24 May 1994, Curtis D Frye commented on Black Unicorn's recent
post about his threatened law suit against "tmp" and Netcom.  While I
agree with Curtis' response, that is not the purpose I am writing this
response.  I would like to focus on one suggestion for providing anonymous
Internet access.

How about this, instead:  A company called "ID Anonymous, Ltd." sets up in
a business secrecy jurisdiction.  It buys Internet access accounts in bulk
from DGS, Netcom, etc. (ID1, ID2, ID3, . . .).  It then resells them to
people living in the service territories of the various access providers. 
ID Anonymous, Ltd. collects monthly fees from all of its sub-users.  It
pays the Internet provider a single check each month for the monthly fees
of all its anonymous account.  Under such a system, there is no weak 
link.  If a user misbehaves, DGS or Netcom can cut off the offending 
account, but nobody can reveal the identity of the underlying user.  By 
being located in an offshore jurisdiction, ID Anonymous, Ltd. is not 
susceptible to lawsuits or rubber hose techniques.  QED.
