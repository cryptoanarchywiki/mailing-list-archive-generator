The idiot box behind me is making noise about Headline News' lead story
for the evening, Email Stalking.  The woman involved states she'll never
use email again.  Seems to me her arguments are moot, as cypherpunks has
already developed the technology to solve this problem.  Anyone volunteer
to be a spokesperson for rebuttal?
