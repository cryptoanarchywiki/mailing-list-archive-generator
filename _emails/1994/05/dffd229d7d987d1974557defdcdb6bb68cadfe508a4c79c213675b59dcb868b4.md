I had a similar thing happen to: Detweiler sent me private email some months
back, in some apparent urgency, asking my opinion on "pseudospoofing", as "a
director of the Extropy Institute".  I replied that I wasn't in the business -
as an ExI director or otherwise - of having an opinion on everything.

This seemed to really bother him.  He emailed me back, expressing his surprise
that I didn't drop everything and respond to his clarion call.  I'm told -
though I didn't find out until a few days ago - that I too ended up being
listed as a "tentacle".  How amusing.

Or a serious local loopback problem.
