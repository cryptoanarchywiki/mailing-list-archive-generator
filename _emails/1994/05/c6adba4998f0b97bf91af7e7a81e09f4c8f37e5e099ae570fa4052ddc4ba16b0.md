Agreed.  I guess what I was trying to say (though I didn't actually
come out and say it) is that the load is O(N^2).  While not a problem
now, it would be nice to find an O(N) solution.  Or, more likely, 
an O(Nlog(N)).

Indeed.  If we go with a restricted message haven, the problem becomes
very simple.  Maybe we should attempt to get this working first.
