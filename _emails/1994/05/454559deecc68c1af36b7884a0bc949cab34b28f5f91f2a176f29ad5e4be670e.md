	The term Cypherpunks is amorphous, thus subject to use and abuse
	by the masses.  When people like Jeff Davis and Phill Zimmermann
	say "The cypherpunks are generally opposed to Clipper" it makes us
	an "organization" which, like it or not, does have representatives
	and agendas.  Unfortunately, perception defines reality.  If we

I've never said this in any forum, public or private.  The only Zimmerman
quote on cypherpunks I've ever seen was in the WSJ.  He stated he was not
a cypherpunk, he wore a suit when he contacted clients.  In responding to 
this, I've opened myself to another spew by Perry, but what the fuck.  If
one has to take a cheap shot, one is already whipped.  And I'm not here
to win a popularity contest either.
