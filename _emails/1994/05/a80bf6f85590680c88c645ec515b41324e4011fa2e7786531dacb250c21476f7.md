		You have a good summary of what's going on. Personally I've
	found it useful to create a filter for my cypherpunks mail to send
	posts from people whom I respect more into a seperate folder such that
	the signal-to-noise ratio in that folder is higher. When I have more
	time I read the folder with the lower signal-to-noise ratio, but I
	often do not have those resources.
		I don't really have to deal with bad posts because I don't see
	most of them unless I have some extra time on my hands... Others
	interested in rational discussion and debate and actual-doing-things
	might find this a useful technique.

Ditto.  Actually I gateway c'punks straight into a local 'mail.cypherpunks'
group, with the hack script below (there might be an easier way, but I had
the code around anyway).

First, I created a user called 'cypher', then gave it this .forward:

suilven% cd ~cypher
suilven% cat .forward
"|mail2news mail.cypherpunks cypherpunks@toad.com"

Since I'm running the smrsh security wrappers, mail2news has to be in the
special smrsh directory, /usr/adm/sm.bin.

mail2news:
#!/usr/contrib/bin/taintperl
#
# mail2news - Incredibly simple program to take a mail message from
#             stdin and insert it into a moderated newsgroup so you can
#             read mailing list messages via news instead of mail.
#
# Usage: mail2news <newsgroup> <reply-gateway>
#
# Author: Stephen Hebditch <steveh@orbital.demon.co.uk>
#
# Operation:
#   1. Create a new local group (e.g. orbital.lists.uri) with moderated
#      status to contain the local messages.
#   2. Make sure the newsgroup isn't going to propagate outside your
#      system.
#   3. Modify mailpaths (C News) or moderators (INN) so that your local
#      replies get sent back to the mailing list.
#   4. Use a mail filter program (such as comes with elm) to divert
#      messages arriving from the list to this program instead.
#

# Add local config info here
# Make secure (from 'perl' man page)
$ENV{'PATH'} = '/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin';
$ENV{'IFS'} = '' if $ENV{'IFS'} ne '';

$path = $ENV{'PATH'};    # Not tainted

$rnews = "/bin/rnews";
$update = "/usr/local/bin/op updatetrn";
$user = "news";	# If badly installed, news will get the replies
$newsgroup = $ARGV[0];
if (!$newsgroup)
	{

$replyaddr = $ARGV[1];
