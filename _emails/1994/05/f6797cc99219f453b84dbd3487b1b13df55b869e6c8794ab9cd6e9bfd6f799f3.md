A note about a package that uses D-H to generate a key for telnet and ftp
authentication.  Has anyone here played with it?

After hearing about David Safford's SRA telnet/ftp package from numerous
sources, I finally went and got a copy (from ftp://net.tamu.edu/pub/security/TA
MU).

It's nice work.  I would like to clarify one point, though:  This package
uses the Diffie-Hellman code from the Secure RPC implementation, to securely
compute a session key which the SRA code uses to encrypt an authentication
transaction.  The code does NOT use the session key to encrypt the whole
session.  It would probably be relatively easy to add, but it's not in there
in the current code.

This is from my perusal of the code, and correspondence with the author.

FYI
