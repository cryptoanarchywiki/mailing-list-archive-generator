C'punks,

Stop!  Unless you know what you're talking about, there is really no 
reason to post about this thread.

Wrong.  I thought Perry was quite clear on this.  A clearing "system" is 
anyone or anything that will clear a transaction.  Any bank that issues 
and/or accepts digital cash may *clear* it.  Folks, we've been through 
this before.

You get paid some digital money.  You deposit it to your account at the 
1st Digital Bank and Grill.  You go to the store and buy a shirt.  You 
pay using the VISA card issued to you by FDB&G.  Need some cash?  Take 
your FDB&G ATM card and go to any cash machine displaying the Plus logo.  

Simple isn't it?  I don't want to have to explain this again.
