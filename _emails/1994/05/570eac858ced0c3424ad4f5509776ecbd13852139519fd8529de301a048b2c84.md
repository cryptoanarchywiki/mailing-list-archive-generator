 Are you concerned about the Clipper Chip?
 
 Do you think your privacy is too important to be trusted to
 corruptible bureaucrats and secret algorithms?
 
 You can do something about this!

 Washington D.C. on the Clipper chip.  The opportunity to add your voice
 is here!  Best of all, we've looked up all the phone numbers for you!
 
 The hearings will be with the Technology and the Law subcommittee

 SAMPLE LETTER OR PHONE CALL
 
 The Honorable Senator ____________
 
 I understand you will be attending the hearings on the Clipper chip.
 I wanted to express my concern about the use of the Clipper chip
 in personal communications.  The Clipper chip would mandate a 
 privacy standard that is prone to significant abuse.  
 
 Unlike most recent work in cryptography, the academic work surrounding 
 the chip has been kept from the public, developed in secret.
 
 Decent cryptography exists today to protect my communications.
 The Clipper chip threatens my ability to use that technology.
 
 Please oppose the Clipper chip.
 
 Sincerely,
