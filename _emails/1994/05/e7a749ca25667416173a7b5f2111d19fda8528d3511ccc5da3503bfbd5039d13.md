I've had enough folks volunteer for this in NYC that there's no way I'd
back out.  If you want to send me something I'd rather you send me disks
because I don't have any time to buy them.  Just as many 3.5" HD's as you
can... I'll accept money if you'd rather do it that way, but I want to make
sure it gets used up 100% for the disks.  (I'll be taking a $20 loss in disks
and about $100 in taking the day off, if my boss decides not to pay me
for the day off...)

That would be most cool.  Sandy, is you reading this?

Please, anything you can scrounge together or revise.  Also I'd reccomend that
you quote from current magazine articles and mention them.  This way they can
seem more offical media-looking...

I won't include any extra docs or source code.  No room on one disk :-(

I may do this if I have the time.  I have a Mac, but not much time on my
hands anymore... Maybe I'll bring a few Mac disks just incase....

The Wired JackBoots article is freely distributable, so that will go on there. :-)
