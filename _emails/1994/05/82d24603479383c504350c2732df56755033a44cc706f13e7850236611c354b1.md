 Well the elimination of a very weak security feature on the HP palmtop line
the hp 95lx password option, just a screenlock, in the hp100lx any pretence 
to privacy is now gone. 

   As a result I initially attempted to load the binaries for the secdev1.2 
release and was chagrinned to find out they get divide errors on the lowly
8088 clone of the hp100lx...? any ideas?(I suspect they are compiled for 80386
and up and will disassemble to verify after intial recompilation to 8088 

targets.. Has any done this already??

     cheers
     kelly
