No readers digest version.  It is very heavy going, and
any simplified version is necessarily misleading.
 
The key articles are 
 
D. Deutsch, Quantum Theory, the Church--Turing
Principle and the Universal Quantum Computer, Proc. R. Soc. Lond.,
Vol. A400, pp. 96--117 (1985).
 
E. Bernstein and U. Vazirani, Quantum Complexity
Theory, Proc. 25th ACM Symp. on Theory of Computation, pp.  11--20
(1993).
 
Set aside a long time for understanding them.  If your
quantum theory is weak, you will need to brush up on
quantum theory first.
