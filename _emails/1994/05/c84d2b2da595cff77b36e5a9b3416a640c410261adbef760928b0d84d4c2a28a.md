I am working on a story for WIRED about digital money, and notice here that
someone named Pr0duct Cypher is behind the scheme that some people are
experimenting with.  Would Pr0duct Cypher mind contacting me?  Use this
email (steven@echonyc.com) to make the connection.

Also, if anyone else wants to point me to interesting stuff, feel free.
I'm probably on top of the obvious (Chaum, etc), but better to assume that
I'm missing stuff.
