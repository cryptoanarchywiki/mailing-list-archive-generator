FACTORING IN POLYNOMIAL TIME ON A QUANTUM COMPUTER
Peter Shor, AT&T Bell Labs

Richard Feynman and others have challenged the traditional Turing
machine model of computation.  A new model of computation based
on quantum mechanics has recently been proposed.  It is too early
to know whether quantum computers will be practical.  However, it
is shown that quantum computers can factor integers and compute
discrete logarithms in polynomial time.

Any comments on the veracity?
