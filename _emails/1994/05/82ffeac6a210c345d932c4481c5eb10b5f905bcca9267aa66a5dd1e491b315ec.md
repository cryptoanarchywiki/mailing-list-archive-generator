There has never been a ruling declaring it illegal to export PGP.  No one has
ever been convicted of illegally exporting crypto.  The ITAR restrictions also
contain many exemptions, under which it could be legal to export PGP.
Furthermore, If you didn't get your copy of PGP from the US then you haven't
broken any laws.

To what effect?

Or maybe you could just keep on using PGP 2.3a and stop worrying about it.

Why?  Just because PGP 2.6 exists, doesn't mean you have to use it!  If people
want to communicate with you, they will use 2.3a also...or fix their damn
software.  It's their problem, not ours, so let's make it their problem!
Boycott MIT-PGP.
