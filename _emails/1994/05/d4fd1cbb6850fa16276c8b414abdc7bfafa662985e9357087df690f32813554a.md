"Privacy is the most comprehensive of all rights...the right to  
one's personality," wrote Louis Brandeis for the <<Harvard Law  
Review>>, back in the musty pre-fax 1890s. But Judge Thomas  
Cooley, an obscure contemporary of Brandeis', probably put it  
better: "Privacy is the right to be let alone."

Unfortunately, our clever founding fathers neglected to mention  
privacy specifically in either the Constitution or the Bill of  
Rights. The fourth amendment does secure you from "unreasonable  
searches and seizures", but it doesn't prevent your boss from  
bugging the company bathroom, a federal employer from demanding a  
urine sample, or your nosy neighbor from tapping into your  
cordless phone conversations with a police scanner.  

In sum, your safeguards against government, corporate, and  
freelance snoopers are pretty slim, dependent on a handful of  
narrow federal and state laws and scattered court precedents.  
California and a few other states embed broad privacy protections  
right up front in their constitutions, but this is an exception,  
not the rule.  

So don't leave home without protection. If you want to protect  
your credit rating, prevent your boss from rifling through your  
email, or keep the government out of your bladder, peruse this  
compendium of vital privacy resources that no one should be  
without. There's something here for everyone, from the casual  
reader to the privacy buff.  

----> Books

Your Right to Privacy
This omnibus pocket guide from the ACLU covers just about every  
privacy issue under the sun, such as what an employer can  
disclose from your personnel records, confidentiality of AIDS  
tests, who can ask for your Social Security number, how to  
correct government records, and how to deal with sneaky private  
investigators. "If there's enough money, you can get anything"  
boasts one anonymous PI in the book. "You have to find the weak  
link in the chain and go for it!" The book doles out advice in an  
accessible question and answer format, and includes just enough  
history to give you the proper context. If you buy only one book,  
buy this one.  
<<Your Right to Privacy: A Basic Guide to Legal Rights in an  
Information Society>>
Evan Hendricks, et al, 1990; 208pp.
$7.95 from Southern Illinois University Press, P.O. Box 3697,  
Carbondale, IL 62902-3697, or the ACLU.

Steal This Urine Test
If you've been asked to fill this cup, please, steal this book.  
"Fighting Big Brother's Bladder Cops!" shouts the back cover, and  
nothing could be truer. This classic 1987 volume by the late  
rabble rouser Abbie Hoffman is still in print--a testament to the  
growing acceptance of drug testing in America. Dear Abbie gives  
you scoop on everything: the history of drugs and the  
government's drug paranoia, the culture of employee surveillance,  
the facts (pro and con) about drug use, the inaccuracy of drug  
testing, and of course, how to <<beat>> a urine test, just in  
case.  
<<Steal This Urine Test: Fighting the Drug Hysteria in America>>
Abbie Hoffman and Jonathan Silvers, 1987, 262pp.
$7.95 from Viking Penguin

Privacy for Sale
What happens to that "confidential" credit form you fill out? To  
that workers compensation claim? <<Business Week>> reporter  
Jeffrey Rothfeder knows, and it isn't pretty. Rothefeder's book  
exposes the shadowy information underground--the marketplace  
where credit agencies, the IRS, private investigators, direct  
marketers, and other "data cowboys" legally and illegally acquire  
and sell sensitive information on just about anyone. To  
demonstrate the lax safeguards, the author easily nabs copies of  
both Dan Quayle's and Dan Rather's credit reports. Rothfeder's  
wry book is a cautionary tale of how our new electronic wild west  
of private and governmental databases threaten personal privacy,  
the economy, and more.  
<<Privacy for Sale: How Computerization Has Made Everyone's  
Private Life an Open Secret>>
Jeffrey Rothfeder, 1992, 224pp.  
$22 from Simon & Schuster

Undercover: Police Surveillance in America  
Gary Marx knows about undercover police first hand. When the  
future MIT sociology professor was a student at UC Berkeley, his  
student organization promoting racial equality was nearly  
destroyed when the treasurer--a police agent--embezzled the  
group's funds. But Marx's book looks beyond political policing  
and tackles a tougher question: In the face of rising crime and  
political corruption, when is undercover police surveillance  
warranted? Marx examines this and many other uncomfortable  
questions in this surprisingly readable and lively book for  
academics and policy analysts, and arrives at a rather startling  
conclusion: "In starting this book, I viewed undercover tactics  
as an <<unnecessary evil.>> But, in the course of research I have  
conluded, however reluctantly, that in the United States they are  
a <<necessary evil>>." An extensively researched book that  
specialists--and some general interest readers--will find  
absorbing.  
<<Undercover: Police Surveillance in America>>
Gary T. Marx, 1988, 284pp.  
$11.95 from University of California Press

Privacy: How to Get It, How to Enjoy it
This book is a Mulligan's stew of privacy advice, philosophy,  
resources, humor, and a little conspiracy paranoia thrown in for  
good measure. But as you read story after story--the "little  
Einstein" who hacked into 21 Canadian computer systems, banks  
blithely (and illegally) sharing depositor information with just  
about anyone--you begin to see the author's point of view.  
<<Privacy>>'s pithy chapters identify key privacy abuses (from  
credit card scams to the 24 federal agencies that gather  
intelligence on Americans), offers pointed remedies, explains  
obscure laws that help you keep a low profile, and suggests books  
to read. Sometimes the advice is right on ("consider the use of  
mail-drop services") and sometimes downright weird ("you and your  
friends might try learning an obscure foreign language to promote  
privacy"). Either way, it's a fascinating, eclectic read. Note:  
Eden Press offers half a dozen other privacy books, from  
<<Personal and Business Privacy>> to <<100 Ways to Disappear and  
Live Free>>. For the privacy anarchist within.  
<<Privacy: How to Get It, How to Enjoy it>>
Bill Kaysing, 1991, 128pp.
$18.95 from Eden Press, P.O. Box 8410, Fountain Valley, CA 92728

Privacy in America
David Linowes is one of the privacy experts that every writer  
cites, and with good reason--his knowledge is encyclopedic.  
Although this book mirrors <<Privacy for Sale>> in focusing on  
the abuse of computerized personal data, Linowes' thoroughly  
researched and chilling anecdotes will get your blood boiling.  
The book embraces everything from genetic screening to electronic  
fraud, showing time and again how privacy laws and other  
safeguards are regularly flouted by government and business  
alike. The book is light on advice, but its overwhelming  
evidence, copious studies, surveys, and polls make it worth the  
price.  
<<Privacy in America: Is Your Private Life in the Public Eye?>>
David Linowes, 1989, 192pp.
$19.95 from University of Illinois Press, 54 East Gregory Drive,  
Champaign, IL 61820

How to Get Anything on Anybody
Want to learn how the pros tap a phone, surreptitiously videotape  
someone, tail a bad guy, or crack into a "secure" computer? This  
ultimate hardware catalog-cum-how-to-manual for professional  
snoopers tells all, and even notes where you can buy neat-o spy  
stuff. It's also a boon for less nosy folk, says author Lapin,  
because "the first time someone kicks you right in the privacy  
act" you'll be prepared. If nothing else says Lapin, remember  
this: "law enforcement agencies are only the tip of the  
electronic eavesdropping iceberg. Most bugs are planted by people  
to spy on their spouses or to gain an advantage in business."  
<<How to Get Anything on Anybody: The Encyclopedia of Personal  
Surveillance>>
Lee Lapin, 1991, 224pp.
$38 postpaid from ISECO Inc., 2228 S. El Camino Real #349, San  
Mateo, CA 94403

Other books of interest:

<<Don't Bug Me: The Latest High-Tech Spy Methods>> (M.L. Shannon,  
$23.95 postpaid, Paladin Press). A companion volume to Lee  
Lapin's books, with emphasis on showing you how to protect  
yourself from electronic eavesdropping.  

<<The Law of Privacy in a Nutshell>> (Robert Ellis Smith, $14.50,  
Privacy Journal). Not for casual readers, but if you have an  
interest in the law and the historical underpinnings of privacy  
rights (from torts to "fair information" practices), this book is  
for you.  

<<Protectors of Privilege: Red Squads & Police Repression in  
Urban America>>. (Frank Donner, $34.95, UC Press)  
An exhaustively researched book on repressive police tactics over  
the last 30 years, with much coverage devoted to covert  
surveillance, and the illegal compilation and distribution of  
dossiers.  

<<Cloak and Gavel: FBI Wiretaps, Bugs, Informers, and the  
Supreme Court>> (Alexander Charns, $24.95, Univ. of Illinois  
Press). You think you've got it bad? A gripping tale of how  
Hoover's FBI bugged, harassed, and otherwise attempted to  
manipulate the Supreme Court during the '50s and '60s.  

<<Confidential Information Sources, Public and Private>>
(John Carroll, $45, Butterworth-Heinemann).
The skinny on private and public databases--who maintains what  
data on whom and what rules (if any) regulate how that  
information is disseminated. A slow read, but a valuable  
sourcebook.

<<The I.R.S. and the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts of  
1974>>  (Marcus Farbenblum, $32.50, McFarland & Company).  
Although the subject's arcane, this readable guide details how  
the IRS withholds records and obscures it own procedures--and how  
you can make the IRS "tell you everything you have a right to  
know".

This 32 page report by the US Privacy Council and the Computer

----> Advocacy Groups  

American Civil Liberties Union  
There's no national 911 for privacy emergencies, but the ACLU is  
the next best thing. This granddaddy of all privacy organizations  
lobbies, educates, and sues on just about every privacy front.  
Your local ACLU chapter is a resource for cheap reports covering  
many privacy concerns (from student rights to FOIA access), can  
offer legal referrals, and in certain cases, represent you in  
court.
Membership: $20/year. ACLU, 122 Maryland Ave. NE, Washington, DC  
20002, 202/544-1681

Electronic Frontier Foundation  
The EFF was co-founded by <<1-2-3>> creator and former Lotus  
Development chairman Mitch Kapor to "promote privacy services for  
network users and examine the interaction of computers and  
society." In short, EFF advocates electronic democracy in all its  
forms, and is a force in ensuring that new communications  
technologies are open to everyone and receive proper  
Constitutional protection. The group lobbies Congress and various  
federal agencies, defends users wrongly accused of computer  
crimes, educates and publishes reports, sponsors various  
conferences, provides legal referrals and counseling, and  
sometimes sues federal agencies under the FOIA. <<EFFector  
Online>>, the EFF's newsletter packed with tips, information, and  
recent testimony, is posted on popular online services and  
electronic bulletin boards.  
Membership: $20/year (students); $40 (regular); $100 (corporate).  
Electronic Frontier Foundation, 155 Second Street #35, Cambridge,  
MA 02141, 617/864-0665, 617/864-0866 (fax)

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility  
Like the EFF, CPSR is concerned about civil liberties, computing,  
and telecommunications. The well-regarded group has testified at  
more than a dozen Congressional hearings, led the campaign to  
stop the FBI's wiretap proposal earlier this year, and recently  
recommended privacy guidelines for national computer networks.  
Current CPSR priorities include medical record privacy, curbing  
the misuse of Social Security numbers, and promoting privacy for  
communications users.  
Membership: $40/year (basic); $75/year (regular). CPSR, P.O. Box  
717, Palo Alto, CA 94301, 415/322-3778.

National Consumers League  
For activist consumers and workers, NCL is the party to join. The  
group tackles everything from food irradiation to workplace  
safety to telemarketing fraud. But the NCL has a special place in  
its heart for privacy issues, and recently commissioned a  
national survey on workplace privacy. The bimonthly <<NCL  
Bulletin>> reports on these and other issues.  
Membership: $20/yr. National Consumers League, 815 15th Street  
NW, Suite 928-N, Washington, DC 20005. 202/639-8140

Privacy International
Like Amnesty International, Privacy International is a global  
organization dedicated to fostering human rights--in this case,  
privacy rights. Only 2 years old, PI's first task is to sound the  
alarm over privacy abuses throughout the world and to push for  
the adoption of practices that "guard against malicious or  
dangerous use of technology". PI raises awareness internationally  
about privacy assaults, repressive surveillance practices,  
coordinates privacy advocates around the world, and like Amnesty  
International, monitors and reports on abuses country by country.  
Members also receive the <<International Privacy Bulletin>>, a  
quarterly newsletter with privacy reports from around the world,  
legislative updates, and news on related civil liberties issues.  
Membership: $50. Privacy International, c/o CPSR, 666  
Pennsylvania Ave. SE, Washington, DC 20003.  


----> Online Resources for Computer Users

CompuServe
CompuServe is the Macy's of online services--there's something  
for everyone. Privacy buffs should check out the Electronic  
Frontier Foundation (GO EFFSIG), whose rallying cry is "Civilize  
Cyberspace!". EFFSIG offers online conferences, Q&A with EFF  
staff, and a well-stocked library that includes back issues of  
<<EFFector Online>>, essays on privacy issues, online cyberpunk  
magazines, and more. Other relevant special interest groups  
(SIGs): "The Journalism Forum" (GO JFORUM), which focuses on  
privacy, ethics and journalism; "The Legal Forum" (GO LAWSIG),  
which includes chitchat and papers about privacy and  
telecommunications law; and the "Legal Research Center" (GO  
LEGALRC), an online legal search service that includes indexes  
for over 750 law journals, studies, publications, plus access to  
a handful of legal databases.  
Membership: $39.95 one-time fee, plus $7.95/month. CompuServe,  
5000 Arlington Centre Blvd., P.O. Box 20212, Columbus, OH 43220,  
800/848-8199

The WELL  
This laid-back online service is <<the>> online privacy resource.  
Put out by the same people who, gosh, put out <<Whole Earth  
Review>>, the WELL offers a cornucopia of databases, online  
conferences, electronic mail, access to USENET "newsgroups"  
(including privacy groups), and much more. Three forums are  
largely dedicated to privacy issues: EFF (Electronic Frontier  
Foundation), CPSR (Computer Professionals for Social  
Responsibility), and CFP (Computers, Freedom & Privacy). You get  
online privacy experts, conferences, updates on legislation, the  
status of court cases, and a chance to truly interact with  
privacy professionals. The WELL's interface is a little clunky,  
but you won't find more privacy resources online anywhere.  
Subscription: $15/month, $2/hr of connect time. The WELL, 27 Gate

Sidebar #1:

"Personal Stealth: Ten Things You Can Do to Protect Your Own  
Privacy"  

1.      Minimize data collection. Only give out information that  
<<you>> believe is really essential. And be careful: data is  
often gathered automatically without your knowledge or  
permission.  

2.      Check for accuracy when data is collected for credit,  
medical, and personnel records. Check the information  
periodically for accuracy and to see who else has accessed these  
files.

3.      Exercise your right to opt out. If you feel like it, write  
to the Direct Marketing Association's mail and telephone  
preference services, to be removed from list exchanges. [Write  
to: Direct Marketing Association, 11 West 42nd St., P.O. Box  
3861, New York, NY 10163-3861.] Unlist your name and address from  
the phone book. Use call blocking when you don't want to identify  
yourself over the phone. If you don't want your information  
shared, say so.  

4.      Follow privacy issues. You'll find ongoing coverage in the  
<<Wall Street Journal>> and in newsletters such as <<Privacy  
Journal>> and <<Privacy Times>>. Look for them in your library,  
along with books and other materials on privacy. Educate others  
about what you've learned about privacy. Share your insights with  
family, friends, and co-workers.  

5.      Advocate changes in law and public policy. Let your views be  
known to your state and federal lawmakers. Write to your public  
utilities commission about telephone privacy issues. Write  
letters to the editor; let them know your views about privacy and  
that you'd like to see more coverage.  

6.      Advocate from within. In the organizations where you have  
influence, make sure there's a coherent privacy policy that meets  
the needs of all stakeholders.  

7.      Read the fine print. Ask hard questions. Support businesses  
that respect your privacy; avoid those that don't.

8.      Defend and respect the privacy of others.

9.      Beware of wireless conversations. People do hear your  
cordless, cellular, mobile, and ship-to-shore communications. If  
you don't want to be overhead by your boss, your employees, the  
police, reporters, or two-bit criminals, don't broadcast it. And  
remember: the person on the other end of the conversation may use  
a cordless phone. If this is a problem for you, scramble your  
communications with encryption. The same goes for electronic mail  
and voice mail. Change your passwords frequently and don't trust  
any service 100%, even if it's encrypted.  

10.     Be alert, but not overly paranoid. If you follow steps 1  
through 9, you're doing all you can.

"Marc Rotenberg's Privacy Shelf"

Marc Rotenberg is the director of the Washington office of the  
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, chair of the  
ACM Committee on Scientific Freedom and Human Rights, and  
something of an expert on privacy and telecommunications. In an  
informal electronic interview conducted over Internet, Rotenberg  
shared some of the resources he thinks every privacy buff should  
have.


The Handbook of Personal Data Protection
(Wayne Madsen, 1992, $170 from Stockton Press)
"Outstanding and comprehensive. The bible of international  
privacy law."

Regulating Privacy: Data Protection in Europe and the United  
States
(Colin Bennet, 1992, $16.95 from Cornell University Press, )
"The first comparative study of privacy protection law. Well  
written and informative."

Uneasy Access: Privacy for Women in a Free Society,  
(Anita Allen, 1988, $21 list, $24 post-paid from University Press  
of America)
"Explores the role of gender in privacy. An important book by a  
leading privacy scholar."

Privacy Laws & Business
"An excellent [British] publication that's timely and  
comprehensive. A little expensive, but invaluable for people who  
are interested in following closely privacy developments around  
the world." Subscription: 240 pounds/year, 4 issues. Call 081-
866-8641.  

"The Right to Privacy"
(Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis, 1890, in the <<Harvard Law  
Review>>)
"For history buffs and privacy experts, this 1890 article is the  
starting point for privacy law. Considered one of the most  
important law review articles of all times (it essentially  
created the legal right of privacy in the U.S.), it is still a  
valuable resource for understanding the right of privacy."
