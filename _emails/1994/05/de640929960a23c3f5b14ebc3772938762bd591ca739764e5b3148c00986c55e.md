I see that my post was ambiguous.  I didn't mean that "time" would be  
the currency, rather, "time" would be the "good" purchased.  For a  
given task, one person's time would be more valuable than another  
person's time.  Online reputation services would be necessary.

I guess what I'm really trying to say is that I believe anonymous  
digital cash is currently more suitable for purchasing services  
(time) than for purchasing goods (software, information, bananas,  
etc).   This might change in the future when the use of anonymous  
digital cash becomes wide-spread.
