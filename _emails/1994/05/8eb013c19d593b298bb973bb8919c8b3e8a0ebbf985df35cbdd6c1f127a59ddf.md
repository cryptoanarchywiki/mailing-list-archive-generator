Is my lack of action on this topic going to be of real impact to me?
Will I be thrown in jail for not knowing what AE is, or why MacPGP
might want to be aware of it? Will my inactivity result in the deaths
of millions of sea otters?

You hear that there has been "no action taken" on this new release.
I promise to tapdance wildly later today.

I know that many people assume that others will drop everything and
immediately start doing whatever they ask, but frankly, why should *I*
care? I don't even own a Mac ferchrissake.

PS please don't take this as a denigration of your work. I'm sure its
good work, and I'm sure its of use to some people, perhaps even many
people. I'm only suprised that you think that *everyone* should drop
everything and pay attention.
