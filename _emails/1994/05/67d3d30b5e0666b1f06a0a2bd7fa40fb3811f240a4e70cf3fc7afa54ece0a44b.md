I was aware that David Sternlight had a dubious reputation among the
cypherpunks community, but uptil now I was never really sure why. Now
I know. Could anyone please tell me, for my benifit (and possibly for
other newbies' benefit) what other "escapedes" he has pulled in the
past that have been shonky. I would also like to know why he has an
instinctive dislike of PGP. (Much of it may have happened before my time.)
