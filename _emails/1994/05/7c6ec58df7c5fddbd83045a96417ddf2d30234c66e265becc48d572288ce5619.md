I love James Donald.

I'm probably one of the few people on this list who is actively
involved in cryptography as a business, albeit in a startup capacity.

Most people wouldn't understand your reference, so I'll explain. I'm a
vegan. James thinks that he's making himself sound more impressive by
being personally insulting. Unfortunately, he doesn't understand that
I don't insult easily -- certainly the suggestion that I eat meat and
cheese isn't terribly stinging. I can take consolation in the fact
that James is likely accumulating cholesterol plaques in his arteries
as we speak, and I am thus likely to outlive him.
