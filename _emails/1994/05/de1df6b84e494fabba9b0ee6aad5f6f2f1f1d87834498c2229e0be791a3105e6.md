Well, I'm an anarchist and I would have no *philosophical* problem with 
pursuing redress in the king's court.  It is because I am an anarchist 
that I don't impute any special status to "government."  "Government" is 
just the term we use for one particular form of collective force.  I 
would use it in the same way I would use an oncoming truck; if someone 
were trying to mug me, I would consider pushing them in front of the 
truck.  It would just be a handy tool to be employed for self-defense.  
So to the government often is useful as a handy blunt instrument to keep 
other forms of muggers at bay.

Now in actuality, I have grave *practical* reservations about using the 
government in this way.  It is hard not to get entangled once one begins 
to dance with the devil.

Now ask me if I would have any philosophical objection to taking welfare.
