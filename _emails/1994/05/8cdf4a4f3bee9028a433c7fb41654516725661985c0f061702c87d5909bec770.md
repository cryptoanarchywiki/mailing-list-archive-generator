Re: the latest "Taxpayer Assets Project" pettition against
    charges for internet use.

Personally, internet charges, combined with dropping of NSF
involvement, can't come too quickly for me.  I want to sign
the counter-pettition: 

   To whom it may concern: 
   I'm willing to pay, just get out of the way.

I don't mind if schools subsidize their students' accounts
(tuitions pay for it already and would still do so),
or if whoever funds research would subsidize researchers'
accounts.  But then I believe in the separation of school 
and state, science and state, art and state.

If a charge of $20/month (and falling) gets rid of the whiners, 
charge on.  Fat chance, of course, but they don't bother me
as long as no one takes their advice.

To auditors without the code, calls seem
