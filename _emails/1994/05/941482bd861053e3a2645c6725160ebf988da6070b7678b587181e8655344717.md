One way to get the bytes, which involves passing the data through your
system in several batches rather than once-through, is to take the
last 4 bytes of the message and move them to the beginning, or vice versa.
This avoids lengthening your message by a block each time (and avoids
the need for high-quality random padding at the end), and the bytes
are unlikely to be lower in randomness than the original plaintext,
since they'll have been passed through DES once already.

On the other hand, assuming you're using CBC, this means you either have
to do _lots_ of extra bookkeeping, or else do the second and third
encryptions on the CBC'd text rather than the original text,
which Biham or Shamir showed was weaker.

My intuitive feel about it is that it gains some strength because the
4-byte (half-block) offset introduces mixing between the blocks of data,
and mixing is generally a Good Thing in cryptosystems.  
On the other hand, CBC also introduces mixing between blocks as well,
and is far better studied, and doing stuff experts have studied is also
a Good Thing.  The mixing done by the 4-byte offset is all local;
the data in a given block of input propagates at most two more blocks,
while the mixing done by CBC allows each block to affect all blocks
farther along in the message.  There are also a variety of other ways
to mix data between blocks, including Terry Ritter's various DES-packagings
and some of the other block extension techniques discussed in Schneier.
