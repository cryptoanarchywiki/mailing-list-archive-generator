Hi folks,

You need to get software to see the MBone encapsulated packets. You will also need
a tunnel to your site (and you might already have one). So where to get the software...

I am looking for it on a ftp site but have not found it.

Some of the program names are 

	sd (for session director)
	vat
	wb ( for whiteboarding)
	nv
	

Hey! I just heard from van Jacobson. He wrote alot of this software...

The audio (vat), whiteboard (wb) & session directory (sd) tools
are on ftp.ee.lbl.gov in conferencing/{vat,wb,sd}/*.  The most
widely used video tool (nv) is available on parcftp.xerox.com
in pub/net-research.

Cygnus has a tunnel and so does Sun. 

I wish I could help more. I am still awaiting the PGP - Jeff broadcast.

ps. If you do get it up, the session is "Cyberstation: audio feed"
