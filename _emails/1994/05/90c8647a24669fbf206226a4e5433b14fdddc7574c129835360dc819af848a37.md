Couldn't each message have a short header, which is encrypted with the 
final recipent's public key?  When you go to retrieve mail from the haven, 
you request the complete list of headers (or at least those that are new). 
If you can decrypt the header, then the message is for you.  You then 
request that those messages, and also some random messages, be sent to you. 
If the sender uses one or more current-style remailers to send his/her 
message to the haven, it would much more difficult to work out a map of 
who is talking to whom.
