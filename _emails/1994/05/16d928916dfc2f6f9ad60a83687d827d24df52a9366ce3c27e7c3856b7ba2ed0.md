BRAVO!  Magic Money is a grand idea, but I've never been able to make it work;
for me, at least, it was not "user friendly";  and I like to think I'm
not totally clueless, since it looks as if I'll pass Assembly Language
this semester ;-).  Can't a derivation of MM at least as easy to use
as PGP and/or UNIX be developed?  And, if we REALLY want it to take off,
how about something that is menu based that a typical commercial online 
user could learn to use at a minimal level in a few minutes?  No, I don't
have the skills to take on such a project...but if widespread use is the
goal, and if there are still fewer than 4000 hard-corps PGP users with
their keys on a keyserver, then it appears that someone needs to come up
with a program no more complex than PGP...preferably much simpler.

Regards,

Dave
