I thinkl as long as it doesn't have bayonet lugs or an attachment
to launch grenades then you are OK. NOT, if they mandate a form of
crypto as voluntary, they will with in a few years make it
mandatory. Then you will be breaking the law and rocks at the
federal prison. Distribute crypto to the masses (You remember? THE
DUMN FUCKS THAT DOEN'T KNOW WHAT AN FTP IS) and make them on your
side with political announcements in the program ZIP
