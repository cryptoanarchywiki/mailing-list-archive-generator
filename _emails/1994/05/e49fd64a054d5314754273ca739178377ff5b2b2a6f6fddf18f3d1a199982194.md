The terms you are using are ambiguious. NTMs are no more powerful than
deterministic TMs. They are possibly faster, but there are no
languages that NTMs can recognise that deterministic TMs cannot
recognise. It is hypothesized (though more or less unprovable) that
there is no more powerful model of computation than Turing machines in
the sense of what operations can be performed. Speed is again, as I
noted, a different matter.
