[Mr. Schauble argues that citizenship should not be assigned at birth.]

I'm not sure I agree with you.  Many resident aliens have problems not 
directly associated with protections of citizens, but the stigma of being 
"merely" a "Resident alien."

This aside, there are significant shortfalls in protections to aliens in 
general.

Except that in your example, one could be a "probationary citizen" until 
he or she passed the test.  Perhaps for the illiterate this means 
mandatory accompanied travel for life.  Other examples spring quickly to 
mind.  Consider how the green card stigma affects an individual.

How many shots at the test does one get?  What happens if the limit is 
reached?  Deportment?

I can't help but feel that this only grants the state a new tool to deny 
substantive rights to whoever it feels like it wants to burden.

Basing citizenship on any form of subjective test (which any history 
test will be) is problematic at best.

It's not that I disagree with the concept that citizenship should be 
earned per se, only that it should be earned by exam.

In deference to Perry, followups to e-mail.
