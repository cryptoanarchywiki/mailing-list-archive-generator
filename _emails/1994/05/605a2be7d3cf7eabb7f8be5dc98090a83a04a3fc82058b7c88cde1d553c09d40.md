Here is an exchange I had with the folks at MIT who did PGP2.6. I've
suggested that they delay their anti-patent-infringement gadgetry until
PGP2.6 is more widely available for _all_ platforms.

Perhaps you should delay the expiration of old, pre-RSAREF PGP keys until after
a Mac version is available. That would avoid cutting off a large part
of the populace.
