The US ITAR law exempts many things from export restrictions, among them,
materials availiable in public libraries.  It gives no special definition for a
library.  My American Heritage Dictionary defines "library" as, among other
things, "An orginized collection of recorded data arranged for ease of use."
IOW, an ftp site.  Which means that if a program is available from a public ftp
site, you're legally allowed to export it. :)
