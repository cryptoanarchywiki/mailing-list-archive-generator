The keyserver at wasabi.io.com has been upgraded to cover the
new format of pgp2.5 output and its 8 character Key IDs.  It will
continue to serve keys requested by 6 character ID for a short
while, but the 6 character key database will not be refreshed
with new keys.  After a week or two we will remove the old data
and all requests must be for 8 character Key IDs.

If you have a reference to your key at wasabi in your .signature,
please find the longer form of your key ID and update your
sig file.

Thank you.

The Mgt.
