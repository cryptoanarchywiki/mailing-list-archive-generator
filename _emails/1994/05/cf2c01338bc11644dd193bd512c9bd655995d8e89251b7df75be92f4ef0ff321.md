Maybe you otta forward them something from Barbera Abernathy.

And just how, might I ask, did they determine the sex of various posters.
Heck, as far as you know I'm another Mark Ethan Smith.  And there are

I've also noticed several notorious loons being quoted in the mainstream.
Dave Hayes & John Palmer jump to mind, and you can just bet that Detweiler
