A few moments ago I uploaded a file called "hyperdsk.zip" to the soda (cwrc??) 
site in the incoming directory.

My understanding is that this is a disk utility program with some encryption 
option.

It is my hope that someone will take a look at the executable and try to 
discover what method of encryption is used.  I suspect DES, but that is a wild 
guess without the slightest basis in evidence.

Although I do not want to comment more specifically on the list just yet, an 
evaluation of the method and strength of the executable will go a long way to
answering questions about the capabilities and resolve of federal law 
enforcement in cryptanalysis.

Unfortunately the executable offers no basic text documentation.   (I assume it 
is instead "online."  As I am a mac user, these are unavailable to me.

I hope that some diligent MSDOS 'punk will take a look and see what can be 
seen.

In addition, I was hoping someone could provider a pointer to a robust and 
aggressive disk wipe utility.  Something with varied triple wipe, or "DOD" 
spec overwrite (which isn't really DOD spec at all) would be nice.
