  and I then gibbered :
  That is correct.  As a matter of fact, it's an easy theorem that
  an NFA has the same computing capacity as a DFA; it is not known
  whether this theorem holds for more powerful machines, and is in
  fact the heart of the P ?= NP conjecture.


Whups.  Teach me to post before eating breakfast....  Ignore what
I just said above.
