             HOW TO ADVERTISE AND SELL SERVICES ANONYMOUSLY

Now that we have two or more digital banks operating, we face the problem
of actually marketing services anonymously.  Here is a suggestion on how
that can be done.

Let's say you have the licence/I.D. information which Black Unicorn
collected recently, and you wish to profit from it.  Then, in the best
traditions of Usenet, you would post a short (anonymous) notice in the
misc.forsale newsgroup, stating what the offering is, and asking, say,
12 GhostMarks or 10 DigiFrancs.  Of course, the average reader of
misc.forsale will be a mite confused by this, so an explanation in the
.sig space would be helpful.  Something along the lines of,

"finger phantom@stein.u.washington.edu for information about MagicMoney".

So let's say you have a customer who is willing to pay.  Where does
he/she send the cash, or just ask for further information?  You could
use an anonymous server like penet, but as has been shown, there are
problems involved in mapping anon i.d.'s to real i.d.'s.  Plus as our
friend David Sternlight pointed out recently, packets can be traced.
Incoming and outgoing traffic can be compared and the routes monitored.
In short, there are risks.

I suggest a different technique.  Use the "Jay Prime Positive Mail Pool".
Here is a short description:

     Send mail to jpp=0x123456@markv.com, and the mail will be
     encrypted with the key matching 0x123456, and sent to alt.test
     with a subject line of "Ignore 0x123456"

     To add a key, send to jpp=poolnew@markv.com.  The body of the
     message should contain the public key in pgp format.  If there is
     a key clash, a message with the subject "Ignore jpp=poolnew key
     already in use"

Therefore, in your advertisement in misc.forsale, just say, "Interested
parties should mail their digital cash certificates to:

    jpp=0x(your_PGP_number)@markv.com

Then just monitor alt.test and rake in the money.  And BTW, remember to
send Jay Prime your _anonymous_ PGP key (e.g. pseudonym <su@do.nym>).
