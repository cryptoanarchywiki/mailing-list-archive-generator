In _Applied Cryptography_ by Bruce Schneier, he refers to a system 
proposed by Tatsuaki Okamoto and Kazuo Ohta that meets the following 
criteria:
	Independance. The security of the digital cash is not dependant 
on any physical location. The cash can be transfered through a computer 
network.
	Security. The digital cash cannot be coppied and reused.
	Privacy (untraceability). The privacy of the users is protected; 
no one can trace the relationship between users and their purchases.
	Off-Line Payment. When a user pays for a purchase with electronic 
cash, the protocall between the user and the merchant is executed off-line.
	Transferability. The digital cash can be transfered to other users.
	Divisability. A piece of digital cash in a given amount can be 
subdivided into pieces of cash in smaller amounts.
