MIT has just officially announced the upcoming availability of PGP 2.5.
The announcement was just made at Networld+Interop '94 in Las Vegas by
Jeff Schiller, MIT's Network Manager.  The text of the actual
announcement is available via WWW at http://www.media.org/.  Look under
"MIT PGP Security Announcement."




WHAT WAS WRONG WITH 2.2? Damn programers can never do anything
right the first time?

No free man shall ever be de-barred the use of arms. The strongest
reason for the people to retain  there right to keep and bear arms
is as a last  resort to  protect  themselves  against  tyranny  in
government. <-------- Thomas Jefferson                            --
