Well, the biggest (and maybe the only) difference is mail doesn't
leave the haven.  It's like a post office box, you have to show up to
retrieve your mail.

- From my experience running remailers, posts other operators send here,
general observations, and various attacks we've all suffered through,
it seems like most of the problems/objections we get stem from the
fact that anonymous remailers (drum roll...) actually send mail!

For example:
* Eli just sent a message about somebody who used his remailer to
mailbomb something...

*this list has been victim to the rantings of various individuals
anonymous and otherwise.

*somebody forwarded a ClariNet post through Scott Collins' remailer
thus causing him difficulty

*remailers operators have to fear some fool will remail to
whitehouse.gov (or the operatros have blocked that address)

*the message pool Miron runs is susceptible to mail bombing

I'm not saying we should junk the anonymous remailers and replace them
with message havens... it's just a suggestion that may solve a few
problems we are having.  Until positive reputation filters show up and
everybody digitally signs their posts, etc.

Digital cash payments for each message stored would greatly reduce the
mailbomb problem for message havens as well as anonymous remailers.
