Buy a cellular phone, and put call forwarding on it.  Set the phone to 
forward to your destination, then call your phone.  This will block 
caller ID, and make other forms of tracing more difficult.

  And, in you live in Chicago, it can be used to make free phone 
calls...  Details on that if you ask nicely...
