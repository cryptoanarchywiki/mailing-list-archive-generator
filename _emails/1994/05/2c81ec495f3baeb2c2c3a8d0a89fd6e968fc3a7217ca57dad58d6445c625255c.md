re: on list deletion

   Or is there
   no way for even the list managers to know?

We don't know what happened to the list, although we suspect a
technical problem with full file systems.

   Clear information is one of the best ways to dispell paranoia.

It may dispell the attack of paranoia, but it does nothing to address the
underlying mental state, which is what I was talking about.
