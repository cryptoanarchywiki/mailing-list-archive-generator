-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I am happy to announce that the keyserver at pgp.mit.edu is back in
operation, due to the release of PGP 2.6.  This server can be accessed
by sending mail to the address pgp-public-keys@pgp.mit.edu.  It will
not accept keys labeled as coming from PGP versions less than 2.4.

If you have any questions, send mail to the server with a subject of
"help", and it will respond with the list of commands that it accepts.

Enjoy!

- -derek
