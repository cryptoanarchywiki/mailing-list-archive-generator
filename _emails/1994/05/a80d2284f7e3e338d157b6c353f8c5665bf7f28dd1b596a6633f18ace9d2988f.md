    From: norm@netcom.com (Norman Hardy)
    
    There was a long article in April 11, 1994 Forbes: "AUCTIONING THE
    AIRWAYS", by George Gilder". It had a supprising amount of technical
    information about a new technology similar to spread spectrum. The article
    has a "too cheep to meter" flavor that I do not agree with but it does
    present some interesting information and ideas.
    
    It is about 43k bytes and is available via anonymous ftp at
    netcom.com:/pub/Silk/auction.txt
    
By all means, please triple or quadruple check any alleged `data'
coming from George Gilder.  No matter what you might think of Susan
Faludi, she has documented a tremendous amount of misrepresentation
and outright lying on the part of Mr. Gilder.  In *many* cases, very
simple follow up on his attributions reveals that he has his head
firmly wedged up his ass.
