"Dead White European Males didn't have World Domination handed them on a 
silver platter.  They had to *earn* it.  When they started out, they were 
blue-painted savages living in a cold, underpopulated territory far 
removed from the centers of civilization in the Mediterranean and Arab 
worlds.

We could give up this power to various whining dregs of humanity without a 
fight but that would be unfair to them.  'What we achieve too easily we 
esteem too lightly' etc.  I'm afraid you all are going to have to work for 
a living.  So sorry."
