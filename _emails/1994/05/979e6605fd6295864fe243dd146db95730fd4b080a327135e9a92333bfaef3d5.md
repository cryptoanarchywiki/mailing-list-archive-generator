Ahhh.

My lurking pays off!

So good to see talk in earnest about "Cyphercash" (I noticed from my
reading of the imp-interest archive that Digicash(tm) is taken already ...)

I have been looking for a sound business reason for digital cash. I think
you folks may have found it.  Something to beat over the head of my
B-school trained pals anyway...

I think the primary reason that utilities put up with the float on checks
is because they have no choice. Credit card fees are too onerous, and there
were too many ways to cheat the old coin-operated electricity meter down
the hall.

There was a discussion in Forbes a while back (if anybody wants me to go
find it, let me know) about how electric utilities somewhere were running
pilot systems of prepaid electricity cards, which would get rid of meter
readers and their attendant overhead, and replace it with commissioned
"agents" (the local corner liquor store) ;-) in some of the higher-risk
neighborhoods.

I think there might be other reasons for using digital cash, but I'll take
cash in advance for a pornography feed for a start.

Anybody else out there with less draconian advantages to digital cash?
