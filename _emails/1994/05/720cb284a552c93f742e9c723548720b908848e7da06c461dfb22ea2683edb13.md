Thank you for clearing this up; I think it's severely overdue.

I've tried to gently point this out when it came up, but there was never a
_shred_, _scintilla_, _iota_, or _atom_ of evidence that Mr. Nalbandian,
although an extreme dope, was in any way involved in the mass unsubscribing
of a few weeks ago.

I mean, fun's fun and all, but many people on this list are carrying
personal paranoia to an, in my opinion, unhealthy extreme.  Moreover, the
willingness to point at a supposedly guilty party on the basis of no
evidence whatsoever does not speak well of the commitment of many here to
any of the commonly accepted principles of a free society _other_ _than_
that of privacy.  Presumption of innocence?  Reasonable doubt?  Any of
those things ring a bell?

I would even go so far as to suggest that those who have cast blame in Mr.
Nalbandian's direction should apologize to him.
