You have to register.  When you fill out the form to register to vote, you
get a bunch of choices for "Party Affiliation", i.e. Democrat, Republican,
Communist, etc.  Then there's a blank line if you want to use something
other that the standard choices.  You write in "Anarchist".

In a month or so, the Board of Elections sends you back a card showing you
to be a registered Anarchist.  Of course, you don't get to vote in the
primaries...

Well, that's how it works in California, anyway.
