Hi guys, I'm an idiot. :-)  A few days ago, I saw a message by someone
on sci.crypt about a stego faq he was doing.  I contacted him and told
him about a program I'm working on, but lost his address and the news
daemon already purged his message. :-(

So if you're the one, or know who is, please email me.

The next message will be some info on WNSTORM which is the program I'm
writing...
