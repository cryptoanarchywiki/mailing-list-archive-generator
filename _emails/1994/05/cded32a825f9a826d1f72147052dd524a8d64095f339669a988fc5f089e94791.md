The only place you're likely to find only info on crypto is [drum roll please]
sci.crypt on usenet news. :-)  While crypto is the main focus of cypherpunks,
occasionally other <important> issues do come up.

Privacy, the evils of the state, microphones in Dunkin Donuts, etc. are
certainly of interest to the denizens of cypherpunks, and so quite on topic.
:-P


We'z stoned immaculate...
