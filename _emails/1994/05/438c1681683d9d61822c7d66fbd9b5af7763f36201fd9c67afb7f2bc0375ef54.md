If this is truely how you feel, then I would like to remind you that you 
subscribed to this list...  It'll be so much nicer when you unsubscribe.

I'm sorry we were not what you are looking for.  Frankly, I can't even 
tell you where to look, since I have not been in any usenet groups that 
had quite your "quality" of postings.
