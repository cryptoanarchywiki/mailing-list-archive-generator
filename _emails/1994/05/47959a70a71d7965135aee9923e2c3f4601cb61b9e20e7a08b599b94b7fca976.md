Most TLAs are required, by their charter/nature/whatever, to have a very
paranoid world view.  Governmental Intelligence (oxy-moron) deals with
*POSSIBILITIES* before considering intent.  For the most part, this is
useful.  However, it works both ways.  WE must also deal with Possibilities
before considering Intent.  Most employees of TLAs are, IMO, honest and
patriotic citizens.  It only takes ONE, however, to destroy all trust and
credibilty for the agency.

The NSAs refusal to publicly discuss ways to safeguard against such abuse
is one of the key arguments against Clipper/EES and Digital Telephony
issues currently under debate "on the net."  (However, I *STRONGLY* urge
the TLAs to continue their hard-nosed positions.  Stand fast you guys. ;-)

To answer your original question; the reasons why NSA would monitor us will
seem completely sane and reasonable TO THEM.  You MIGHT be engaged in
activities harmful to "the rest of us."  Even Joe Public will find their
arguments difficult to refute, particularly following a terrorist-type
incident involving loss of life.

Likelihood?  ==>  100%

Of course it does.  Any other expectation is unreasonable.  Very few
(even of us altruistic heroes ;-) willlingly relinquish power once
it is acquired.  The trick is limit what they acquire...
