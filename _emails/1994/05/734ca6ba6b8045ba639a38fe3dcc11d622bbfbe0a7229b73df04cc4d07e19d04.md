The Baltimore Sun also ran the AP story on the hidden
microphones at Dunkin Donuts. But they sent some reporter
out to freshen up the story and check the local DDs.

They report that the DD in Severna Park (a nice suburb
of Baltimore that is next to Fort Meade) and the DD next
to Fort Meade itself have the mikes. 

Hah!
