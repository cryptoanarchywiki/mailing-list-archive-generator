Strong cryptography renders moot the Statist's arrogant pretense that
every person is a national of some nation.  With it, the determined
individual can make good his wish to be part of no nation.

Why would a person want to do this?  Read on.

(Sarcastic???)

You made a fitting assertion which I believe to be true and worth
reemphasizing, and I thanked you for it.  That's all.

Government, deceit and all, is sustained and nourished by willful
participation, as you have previously pointed out in the passage
immediately following.  If you participate, it's your conscience you
have to live with.

Keep in mind that the United states is a membership association, not a
geographical region, so to ``live in the United States'' means to
willfully be a member of the United States.  So, yes, to ``live in the
United States'' is certainly to be a willful participant.

But if you're saying it's difficult for a non-member to avoid
participation, I agree; it's difficult.

Where participation is unavoidable, it's not willful.

Except nobody's arguing about willful partaking of societal benefit.
The issue is willful participation in _government_.

The benefit of society results from voluntary association among people.
Imposed relations, as institutionalized in government, benefit only
their perpetrators.
