 This may be true, but the average computer user does not use
Internet, know what an FTP is, know what a BOT is or know that PGP
is even Available. For that mater they do not usualy use BBS's.
For the use to spread they must be made aware by mediums that they
are familiar with, namely the newspaper and then word of mouth.
Nothing high tech there.
