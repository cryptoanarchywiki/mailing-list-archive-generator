I posted a patch to cypherpunks yesterday that does that.

I don't think it does.

mathew@mantis.co.uk is working my patch plus some other stuff into
a brand new version to be called 2.6ui (where the "ui" stands for
"unofficial international").  It will be packaged as a complete release,
with .tar files and .zip files and .sig files etc.  The raw patch file
will also be there.
