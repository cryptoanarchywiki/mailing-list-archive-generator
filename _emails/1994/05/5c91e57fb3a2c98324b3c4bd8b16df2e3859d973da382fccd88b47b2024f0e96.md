Yes!  I meant to mention this in my post, but in my haste I forgot.
Lewis seems like Markoff's dumber, more reactionary little brother.
I haven't seen anything good from him yet (not that I read the Times
every day).

NYT basher's note: I'm surprised at how "liberal" (in the good sense)
Markoff's articles have been.  Lewis's oblivious and lifeless writing
is more of what I expect to see in the Times.
