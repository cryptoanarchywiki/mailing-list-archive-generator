I stand corrected.  On reflection I see that if I receive digital tokens
to my true name, I can pass them anonymously to a pseudonym registered 
in the Cayman islands, and the server will only know that the pseudonym 
received them.

It will not know that my true name received them.  The pseudonym can
then pass new digital tokens to my true name without the server 
knowing.

This system is indeed secure, but only if widely used (mature).

It is not clear to me that it is capable of competing with insecure
account based digital money.

Since US banks will only be permitted to issue account based money
(digital checks) and Swiss banks etc will probably issue primarily
account based money at first, it will be necessary to have an
interface between digital token based money and account based money.

If both are used, as we hope will happen, what then will be the 
competitive advantage of digital tokens?

One advantage is that it is not necessary for the shopkeeper to 
know the customers worth or identity, or to check with the customers
bank.  But the shopkeeper, when dealing with an anonymous customer,
still has to check with the server to see if the coins have already
been used, so this advantage is no advantage at all.

Any other advantages?
