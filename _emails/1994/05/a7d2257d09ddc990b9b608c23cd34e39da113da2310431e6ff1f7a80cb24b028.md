Reason Number 7 why I knew i wouldn't cozy to PGP 2.6 -

After tinkering around, I decided to see what would happen if I
implemented PGP 2.6 using my existing 2.3a keyrings. After performimg
a "pgp -kc paul" PGP 2.6 declares my signatories: 
 
            (Malformed or obsolete signature format)

and asks if I would like it to:
 
            Remove bad signatures (Y/n)? 


Does this mean what I think it means? 

- paul
just a tad miffed
