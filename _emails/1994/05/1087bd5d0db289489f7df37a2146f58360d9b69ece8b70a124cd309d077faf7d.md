No this is directly related.  I was watching the National Commie 
Television special on freedom last night to catch John Perry Barlow's 
excellent piece (clearly the best segmant) and had to sit through some 
whining persons who clearly felt that they were members of inferior 
genders or ethnic groups because they felt unable to take it when people 
said unkind things about them.  Their response was to complain.  It got 
my dander up.

In addition, the nets give us an opportunity to ignore people who can't 
handle independent existence.  They can stew in their pots and we can 
stew in ours.  We don't have to bother ourselves about their trying to 
rule us.

"They have whined for their rights.  We shall give them more than they 
ask for.  We shall give them justice."
