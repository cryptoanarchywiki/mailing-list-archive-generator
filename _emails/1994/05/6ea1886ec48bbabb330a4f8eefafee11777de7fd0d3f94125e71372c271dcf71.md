I don't understand what you mean by the above.

I think the correct address would be just jim%lassie@netcom.com, which is a
UUCP connection to netcom.

Connected to netcomsv.
Escape character is '^]'.

expn netcomsv!nonexisting!addr   #test a bogus addr to see error message
501 netcomsv!nonexisting!addr... nonexisting is an unknown UUCP connection
expn netcomsv!lassie!jim%lassie@netcom.com

The Hams have implemented TCP/IP over the air, using the airwaves as a sort
of ethernet (albiet slowly).  Works quite well.  However, these addresses
are not internet addresses, and the Ham network has very important
FCC-mandated restrictions on message content.  (No encrypting, no
commercial traffic, no explicit or oobscene stuff).  Don't confuse this
with the UUCP city.state.us domains.

If you see a user or site name such as [KN]*[1-9]*  (e.g. N7SZS or K7BUC),
recognize that as a ham call sign and assume that it is a tcp/ip packet
network.
