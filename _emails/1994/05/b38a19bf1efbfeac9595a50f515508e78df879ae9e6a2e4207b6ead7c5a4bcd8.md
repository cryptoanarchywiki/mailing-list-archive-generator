As long as the use is for experimental, research, or educational 
purposes, I don't think Jim Bidzos is going to care much - those are 
permitted uses, under US patent law.

Why go to the trouble?  ftp to rsa.com - if you are a US citizen, get the
README from /rsaref.  It details, quite simply, how to get rsaref and
the ripem stuff, and the licensing docs are in there.

use.
