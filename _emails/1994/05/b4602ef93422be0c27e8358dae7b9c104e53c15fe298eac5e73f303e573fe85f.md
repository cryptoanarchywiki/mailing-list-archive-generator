It's not as easy as you might think.  How many anonymous accounts can you get?
There are only so many anon servers, and for each anon account you have to have
a different real account, all it buys you is your vote registers twice
instead of once.  And anonymous votes can always be blocked - since just the
vote tallies are sent out, you don't really buy anything by being anonymous.

Then that's your decision to make, but others have a different view.  I,
for one, don't want to see a bunch of inane posts from XYZ, so I put
them in my filter file to be discarded.  That will work for individuals,
but to prevent the list from being flooded by malicious users, it seems
that some sort of control would be appropriate.  Nothing would stop someone
from emailing uuencoded core dumps to the list, of course, but the first
time they did it, I think that enough people would be pissed off that they'd
vote to throw them off.  Not that they couldn't receive, they just can't
post.

As I mentioned before, but want to make clear to you, no one individual
would be able to carry out a personal vendetta against another unless
they had a means to obtain many, many accounts and generate anonymous
accounts for each of them.  And, as I said before, anonymous votes could
be just thrown away.
