I guess I don't know much about the _actual_ Netcom... it's just that
so many people have addresses at netcom.com. Perpaps I was misusing it
as a generic commercial account provider.

You are certainly correct here. Cavalier, eh! Without wanting to 
get into this too far as to get off topic and into areas better left
alone, this is just me trying to cure a very long case of bad attitude
(self transformation into a dynamic optimist, as it were...)
and not having succeeded yet. I am cavalier about it because it is
public knowledge, even though I don't have to go spreading it around
myself - but if the truth were known, I have benefitted from the
experience. I think also I must have had a case of the "don't care's"
when I injected just a little too much personal stuff into this effort.
Folks have been asking for action, and where my personal style has not
yet matured enough to be 100% totally professional all the time...
I sometimes open my mouth too far, whereby I insert not only my foot,
but the whole damn leg as well...

Yes, and if I sounded too cavalier in using Tim's name in my 
harangue, sorry - although I was replying to his post.
I'm sure he will let me know if I said anything to offend him.

Well, never say never. I have seen threads I started (which were't
objectionable) go on for weeks long past any input from myself. But,
I guess it is true most of the time. I really wish I could have
attended Extro 1.

Agreed. Absolutely. The single harangue we are discussing now was not
this convincing that you and everyone needs. It was not meant to be.
It was part dreaming part actual planning part just announcing some
goals part training and part just thinking into the keyboard. Part
of a Just Do It motivation that seems to have crept into my somewhat
defective b-class module cpu-brain (possibly damaged) thing here
behind these eyeballs. Having gone out on this limb, however, there
remains this task I have set myself to explain all this...which
will not be completed before I get some sleep.

Well, I guess if I did, it's gone now... Oh well. Not meaning to
be flip - you are right, My reputation has definitely taken some
well deserved hits, and I don't consider it saleable. In deference
to those who dislike smileys, and because I prefer it that way,
I have tried to give up using them.

Well, I suppose it really was a solicitation, if taken word for

in cheek here. Sorry if I misled or if my lingering depression
coloured the tone of my voice - I for one refuse to go seek out
prozac, for reasons I won't get into.

Well, yes, I think. At least I am well on the way to becoming so...

> What do you mean by it?

No. Skip that one. I didn't say '"virtual entity"', I said
'virtual entity', using the word virtual in it's normal, non-buzzword
meaning. It is not real, yet. It is a set of ideas. Now, I know that
ideas are real, but this is too much to quibble over when there is
so much else to do...

...

Yeah. I did worry about that, but They Already Know Anyway.

I actually thought about encrypting the entire message and
only sending it to Customers, because I really should allow
some paranoia back into my life...but nobody would have bought
it!  And wouldn't you know it, just after posting, I got the
detweiller mail bomb and the message from Tim updating newbies
on that perversion. When Cypherpunks get Extropian/Hawk/Ray code,
tmp will be ::exclude'able.

I mean in the game of making money, making this workable, profitable,

to them.

I have had ths very valid criticism before, and I thank you. I am
not actually seeking investment capital here through anything I may
have said with tongue in cheek. And if a $10 cheque _does_ arrive
in the snail, I will do what I said, which is deposit it in trust
and honour the fact that it does not belong to me. Of if it looks
like the horizons are too far away - Tim says 10 to 20 years? -
I will return it.

What can I say - of course ! Focusing on narrow ruthless pursuits has
been one of the ongoing problems I have with a sometimes overactive
sometimes lethargic b-class module cpu-brain (possibly damaged).

This concept of polymath - are you referring to something from
a John Brunner novel of many years ago? Is this a word for which
I need more clarification ?

Probably some fraction of some small number of litres for each

Ditto. Actually, the idea of using Girl Guide cookies as exchange 
medium sounded neat. I order them once a year from my girls, so
those of you with INFO_Banque digital cash you want redeemed, 
get me your order of cookies by, say, the end of January, and
you'll have your cookies in April. $2.50 Canadian per box,
converted to US dollars. But then again, my girls are soon
to be women, so I'll have to switch to bottles of Barleygreen
or something.

Agreed, of course. The plan is to have my digital dollars, if and
when etc etc, backed by good ole yanqui dollars.

No. I do not have this belief, despite whatever attitude I may

Why not! Action, jackson.

First it is noted that I have too high an opinion of myself in
that I have claimed many things I want to do and see happen and
accomplish along my new-found-land, and now I have too low an
opinion of myself because I cannot go out and spend the investment
capital I don't have to do what needs to be done to prevent some
things from recurring that I ought not to have allowed occur in
the first place...

Well, perhaps I am a confused individual. I well recognize the
fact that I am a scatterbrain and that I mix and match my ideas with
those I discover from others, but I am an integrated scatterbrain.
B-class probe modules are self-repairing.

They won't, of course. Some might, assuming some of those interesting

Extropians and or other people in the world want thave digital
cash available on the Internet and trustable chaumian mixes and
anonymous transactions and so on.

Well, yes. Willing and able are not the same. Of course I wouldn't
expect someone as astute and knowledgeable as he to simply give away
this valuable knowledge. I expect Perry himself is one of these
six-figure guys he has warned us about. And he has hinted once in a 
while that he is working on new business. He is much more adept
than most people (read me) at keeping his mouth shut when it really
should be kept shut, and is, as far as I can tell, one who knows the 
difference. Not to mention...

And finally,

I know that. He is probably rolling his eyes upwards and groaning
at this entire response. He has straightened out some goofy ideas
I have harangued about in the past, and, again, not wishing to put
words into the mouth of someone who is so eloquent by himself, he
has expressed the same skepticism of my scatterbrained overambitious
non-focused ideas before. But I have got some of the homework done,
and more is in progress.

> I wish I could say the same of myself.

I also wish I could say the same of yourself -
oops, sorry...heh heh, of course I meant my self.

Thanks for your feedback and help. I know....

But, friends, I am smiling. I may even draft a new version
of the Cypherpunks Quick Code on my next break. There was
an interuption in our feed around about that time - I don't
really know if it ever got through.

And regarding my overambitious, somewhat bubbly stuff about
all the miracles my INFO_Banque will accomplish and my other
businesses will achieve - I refuse to put limits on what I can 
do. I've been there and done that and it didn't work. Focus, sure,
but limits? That would be non-EC! You want action, so hang on
a minute.

Meanwhile another few dozen messages have come in...Perhaps I
should retire now before sleep deprivation starts a perversion...
and keep asbestos pajamas on when I get up.
