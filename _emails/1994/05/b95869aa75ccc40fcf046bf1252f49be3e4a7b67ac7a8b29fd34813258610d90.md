That URL I posted earlier for MIT's PGP announcement won't work after
some time today.  (The server is/was located in the Hilton Ballroom and
had to be moved.)  A more permanent URL is:

		  http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html

This URL will be updated to include information on how to get PGP 2.5
when it is available.
