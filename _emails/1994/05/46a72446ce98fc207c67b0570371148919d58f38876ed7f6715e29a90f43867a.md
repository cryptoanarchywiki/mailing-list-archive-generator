Ok, here's my vision:

Set up an ftp archive site. Assign it a pgp key pair. Set up
one of those ftp-by-mail programs. To send a message to
someone, you give it a random name, asciify it, and use a
chain of anonymous remailers to deposit it on the ftp site
(some crypto-dollars may be required at this point).
Included with the main file is a file with the same name but
a .txt extension, containing some info that will identify it
to the reciever (could be the key id# that it's encrypted
to, or something like "the chicken turns grey at dawn" or
whatever). When you want to check for messages, you string a
message through a few remailers and ftp (it would accept
encrypted reply blocks) *.txt back to you... then just grep
them to determine the target file and repeat the retreval
process... Hmmm..  ok I just realized that this defeats the
whole point of the message haven thing, as it also could be
used for harrassment... oh well, maybe there'll be a use for
it anyway.. but I cant think of it now... damn. Hmm how
'bout this then: just take a message pool like pool-0 or
whatever, and set it up so that when it receives a message
it throws it onto an ftp site, with a separate file for each
day's mail. That way you could ftp once per day and get all
the messages at once, and it wouldn't clutter up your
mailbox. Sender untraceability due to remailers. Receiver
untraceability due to getting all messages. Lack of
harrasement potential (can't force someone to ftp
something). And resistance to mailbombing attacks with the
implimentation of digital postage and storage fees.

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
