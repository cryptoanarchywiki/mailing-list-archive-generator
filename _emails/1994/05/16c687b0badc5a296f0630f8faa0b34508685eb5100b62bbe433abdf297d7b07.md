The address N7SZS@K7BUC.AZ.US.NA is Packet Radio address.  Few ways of
getting it mail from the internet, in it would be read for violations of
FCC rules before it went out anyway.

Amateur Radio operator's addresses are available in various callbooks,
including a few online.  Check the Yandroff(sp?) Services list for
addresses.  (I'm doing mail offline, or I'd do it and include it with the
message),  No FOIA is required (although I suspect a FOIA would be honored
for it)
