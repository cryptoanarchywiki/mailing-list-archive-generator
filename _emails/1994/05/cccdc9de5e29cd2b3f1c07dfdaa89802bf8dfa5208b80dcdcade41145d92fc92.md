I think I see that... If your accounting systems were tightly coupled
enough, (and you were completely cash based) you could get your pro formas
on 12:01 am the day after the quarter ended. Of course you wouldn't have a
chance to back-pedal the results so well, either. .

Your comment about clearing reminds me of something else, though. I know
that options are settled much faster (Next-day, if I remember.  It's been
too long since I was in a cage.) than equity and fixed-income (5 days)
securities.

Is it possible to see instantaneous settlement happen in the financial
markets with digital cash?  I keep remembering that Edison made his first
real pile by inventing the stock ticker, though I'm not sure how
crypto-anarchist libertarians (syntax-error?) would make theirs here. ;-)

OTOH, would "immediate and final clearing" in a peer-to-peer clearing
mechanism be a useful enough benefit that a market's participants would pay
to use it?
