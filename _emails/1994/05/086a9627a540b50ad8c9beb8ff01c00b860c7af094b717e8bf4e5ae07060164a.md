I think the second poster assumed what I did - that the message would be 
split into say 5 parts, each to be encrypted differently.  How to X-or 
split the message isn't obvious to me - pnrg? If you use some bytes 
conveniently hanging around you may as well use a OTP, since both ends 
need the same bitstream.  Unless I'm missing something, which is usually 
the case.
