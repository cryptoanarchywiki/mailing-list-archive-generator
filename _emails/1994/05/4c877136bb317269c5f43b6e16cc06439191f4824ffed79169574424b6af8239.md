If any of you managed to get it off wuarchive, great.. if not, sorry... I've
just looked and some sysadmin removed it... I haven't seen it in the msdos
directories either so that's a big problem...

I do however have the permission of someone to use theri ftp site, however, I
cannot publically post the site name at his request.  If you want it, email
me and I'll tell you the site name, but please don't post it to the list.
