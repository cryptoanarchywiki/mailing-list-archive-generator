So what happened?  All I know is that I stopped getting cyperhpunks mail
and after several days and several pings to cyperhpunks-request I remembered
it had majordomo and re-subscribed.  This started at the same time as
severe network problems in my building inside DEC so at first I thought it
was related to that.
