Hal Finney mentions that the law is often forced to make absurd
distinctions between OK and illegal acts, simply because the line must be
drawn somewhere.  It's a good point, and worth keeping in mind.

It seems obvious to me that, for purposes of ITAR regs., the Dept. of
State and Dept. of Defense here in the USA have drawn the line between
printed text (OK) and ASCII text files on electronic media (illegal to
export).  Their line selection is probably based upon their interpretation
of the self-contradictory ITAR regs.

However, just because one part of "the law" has drawn a particular line,
we shouldn't assume that line to be the final word.  If we do indeed
believe that electronic expression and electronic publishing are the moral
and constitutional equivalents of paper publishing, there should be no
line at all.

A lawsuit could force the line-drawers to officially recognize this
fundamental democratic truth.
