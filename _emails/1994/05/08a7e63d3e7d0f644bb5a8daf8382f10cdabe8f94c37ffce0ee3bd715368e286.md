		 Beta Test Release of PGP version 2.5
			     May 9, 1994

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology announces the distribution
of PGP version 2.5, incorporating the RSAREF 2.0 cryptographic toolkit
under license from RSA Data Security, Inc., dated March 16, 1994.  In
accordance with the terms and limitations of the RSAREF 2.0 license of
March 16, 1994, this version of PGP may be used for non-commercial
purposes only.

PGP 2.5 strictly conforms to the conditions of the RSAREF 2.0 license
of March 16, 1994.  As permitted under its RSAREF license, MIT's
distribution of PGP 2.5 includes an accompanying distribution of the
March 16, 1994 release of RSAREF 2.0.  Users of PGP 2.5 are directed
to consult the RSAREF 2.0 license included with the distribution to
understand their obligations under that license.

This distribution of PGP 2.5, available in source code form, is
available only to users within the United States of America.  Use of
PGP 2.5 (and the included RSAREF 2.0) may be subject to export
control.  Questions concerning possible export restrictions on PGP 2.5
(and RSAREF 2.0) should be directed to the U.S. State Department's
Office of Defense Trade Controls.

Users in the United States of America can obtain information via FTP
from net-dist.mit.edu in the directory /pub/PGP.
