Subject: Problem with my Mail (1000 extra lines of junk)
Message-ID: <199405131851.LAA08746@netcom.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


Several people have written me to inform me that my last mail message
to the list had 1000 lines of extra junk appended at the bottom:

501 macrakis@osf.org~h...  550 Host unknown (Name server: host not
found)
501 macrakis@osf.org~h...  550 Host unknown (Name server: host not
found)
...etc...

I've informed the folks at Netcom. If _this_ message has the same
extra junk, then I'll of course cease posting until the problem is
fixed.

Thanks,
