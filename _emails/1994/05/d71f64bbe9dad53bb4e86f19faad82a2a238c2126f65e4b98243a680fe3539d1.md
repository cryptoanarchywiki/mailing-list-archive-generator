The stalking itself wasn't conducted via email, from my understanding of
the story.  They met via email (on AOL, it appears), and she tried to slow
things down, and he showed up and sent her email saying he saw her leave
work, and that he thought she was attractive.

The involvement of email is only secondary, but since email fits in the
"Information Superhighway" buzzword catagory, I suspect CNN jumped on this.

This really has little to do with cryptography, though.
