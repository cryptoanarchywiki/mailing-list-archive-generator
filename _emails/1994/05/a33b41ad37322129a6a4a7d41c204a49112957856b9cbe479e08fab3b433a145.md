Would it be your position then, that, say, any woman who doesn't happen to
have an unlisted phone number is fair game to have her name and number
written in a toilet stall in Grand Central Station with the notation "For a
Good Time, call..."?  You wouldn't feel that to be an invasion of privacy?

(If indeed it is the same

Sorry, but we clearly disagree here.  I view it as a clear incitement to
harassment, and, in my opinion, _that_ constitutes an invasion of privacy.

>In short Lefty:  Privacy comes to those who seek it.

No.  Privacy is, or should be, the right of all.  I don't have to do
anything special to enjoy my rights to free speech or free assembly.  I
should not have to take special measures to enjoy my right to privacy,
either.

If I don't lock my front door, that doesn't imply that anyone can walk into
my house.  To do so would _still_ be an invasion of privacy.

>Mr. Nalbandian got exactly what privacy he paid for:  None.

This misses the point entirely.  Even the indigent have a right to privacy.

"Hey!  The ends _do_ justify the means!"
