MONDEX SPECIFICATIONS FOR ELECTRONIC CASH PAYMENT RELEASED

Nationl Westminster Bank today (26th April) announced that it is rele 
asing the first of its product development specifications for Mondex,
 the electronic cash payment service which it will launch in the UK n
ext year in a joint venture with Midland Bank and BT.

These specifications will enable manufacturers to begin the developme 
nt of Mondex-compatible products such as point-of-sale terminal equip 
ment for retailers and bank cash machines as well as opening up compe 
tition for the production of other Mondex devices such as the Mondex 
electronic wallet and the Mondex personal balance reader. The specifi 
cations take account of existing ISO standards for Integrated Circuit
 (IC) cards and other emerging IC card standards.

Tim Jones, Chief Executive of Mondex, said: "Production of Mondex dev 
ices was neccessarily limited to a number of specialist suppliers to 
provide the basis of next year's large scale launch in Swindon. Howev 
er, Mondex has been designed as a global product and we are now in a 
position to provide interested manufacturers around the world with th 
e specifications they need to begin development of their own new prod 
ucts or to adapt their existing ranges to be Mondex compatible.

"Mondex offers manufacturers an exciting opportunity to develop and m 
arket new product ranges that add value to the simple Mondex proposit 
ion -- the storage and transfer of electronic cash" he added.

Devices for the Mondex launch in the UK are being developed by:

* AT&T Global Information Solutions (formerly known as NCR) -- cash m 
achines

* BT -- residential telephones and payphones

* Dai Nippon Printing Co. Ltd. / SPOM Japan Co. Ltd. -- cards

* De La Rue Fortronic -- retailer terminals

* Hitachi Ltd. -- integrated circuits

* Oki Electric Industry Company Ltd. -- electronic wallets

* Panasonic (Matsushita Electric/Matsushita Battery) -- electronic wa 
llets and personal balance readers

* Texas Instruments Ltd. -- personal balance readers.
