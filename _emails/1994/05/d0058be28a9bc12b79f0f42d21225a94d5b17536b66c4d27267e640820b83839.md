On May 20th, Bob Snyder mentioned he got a free anti-Clipper poster from  
RSA.  Interested, I sent an e-mail to info@rsa.com asking how I could get  
one of the posters (I included my business mailing address).

Kurt Stammberger from RSA replied "We'll send you one!"

A tube with three of the posters arrived today.  If anyone else want a  
poster, all you need to do is ask RSA.
