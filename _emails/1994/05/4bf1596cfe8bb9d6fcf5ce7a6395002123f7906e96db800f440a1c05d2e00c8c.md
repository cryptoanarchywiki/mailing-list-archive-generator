5/3/94 House Clipper/Digital Telephony hearings being held

	HERE'S WHERE TO CALL TO VOICE YOUR OPINION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================================================================

On May 3rd there will be hearings on Digital Telephony.  This is the
bill proposed by the FBI which would mandate wiretapping equipment
be built into all communications devices.  The FBI has done little
to assure the public that the scheme will not be:
	-prone to abuse because of a lack of safeguards, and
	-secure from malicious eavesdroppers

And yet, without this proof, they are asking us to allow them to pass
a law which would mandate building these wiretaps into every piece
of communication equipment.  Our privacy is too precious to be
entrusted to bureaucrats who don't feel the need to answer to us.

The House Science, Space, and Technology subcommittee on Technology,
Environment, and Aviation will hold a hearing to address both
the Clipper and Digital Telephony issues.  

If you see your representative below in the list, call them and
tell them you oppose the Clipper chip and Digital Telephony as
being a danger to your privacy. 

If you don't know who your representative is, or if you don't see
them on the list, call in your comments to the House subcommittee
at:
	(202) 225-8115 (voice)
	(202) 225-7815 (fax)

[If you live in any of the states below, please try to call your
Representative.  Otherwise, the number above will be fine.]

Faxes and phone calls tend to be brief chances at communication.
Here is a sample, concise one that may give you ideas for your own.


SAMPLE LETTER OR PHONE CALL
 
The Honorable Representative ____________
 
I understand you will be attending the hearings on the Clipper chip
and the FBI's Digital Telephony bill.

I wanted to express my concern about the use of the Clipper chip
in personal communications.  The Clipper chip would mandate a 
privacy standard that is prone to significant abuse.  

Unlike most recent work in cryptography, the academic work surrounding 
the chip has been kept from the public, developed in secret.

Decent cryptography exists today to protect my communications.
The Clipper chip threatens my ability to use that technology.

The Digital Telephony bill would mandate wiretaps be built into
almost all communications equipment.  Furthermore, it would arrange
for "call setup" information (about who I call, and for how long) to
be sent to the FBI over their networks.

The potential for abuse of such a tool is great, while the ability
to have it abused is even greater.  Please oppose the Digital
Telephony bill, as it does little to protect citizens from abuse
of this technology once in the hands of computer intruders and
corrupt law enforcement officials.

Please oppose the Clipper chip and the Digital Telephony bill,

Sincerely,
