I don't think so, honestly.  My legislators (Feinstein, Burton, Pelosi
and Boxer) are just like you:  They have their agenda, they won't
address the issue, they don't care what I think and they don't want
to hear about it.  Did I leave anything out?

It's discouraging to someone who used to think the truth mattered.

I won't bug you any more on this, but think about it, Jeff.  Really.
