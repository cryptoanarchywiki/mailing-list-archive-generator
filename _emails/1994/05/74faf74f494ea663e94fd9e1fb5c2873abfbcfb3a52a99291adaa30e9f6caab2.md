Can't Majordomo implement passwords for individual users so that only
*they* can unsub themselves?  It seems ironic that the Cypherpunks list
would be vulnerable to this sort of "attack" from miscreants like [insert
bozo-of-choice here].

As an aside: I've set up a filter that immediately trashes anything from
the above-mentioned "person."  I just don't need that kind of noise.

Absolutely valid, Matthew: I recommend that we do our best to resolve what
will be done to counter this tactical move against PGP here on this list -
without spreading confusing rumors around to the benefit of RSA Labs - and
meanwhile provide a simple, patched version of 2.3 for all platforms that
both offers fully-2.6-compatible ciphertext and 2.6-impersonating keys.
