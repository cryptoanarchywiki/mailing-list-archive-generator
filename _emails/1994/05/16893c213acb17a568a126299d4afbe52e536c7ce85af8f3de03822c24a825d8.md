Well, did anyone write "who cypherpunks" to Majordomo? I did. The number
of people it contained was about 10 (although it would probably be more
than that by now). My guess is that someone (possibly Jim Nalbadian (sic?))
was the culprit.

	On a related matter, do you need an old (i.e. about 2 weeks old)
copy of the cypherpunks mailing list, so as to bring it back to its old
glory?
