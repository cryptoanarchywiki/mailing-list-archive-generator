Amen to this! Wait a week, and this might be a great thing. If not, keep
using 2.3a.

I know that Jim Bidzos was interested in having a "pgp compatible" program
that started with rsaref and was legal and free. I know because I asked
him about liscensing last spring. He pointed me to an effort that
professor Jeffery Schiller (pgp key 0C4EE1 (jis@mit) on the usual servers)
was coordinating. I exchanged a few messages with a student up there,
then got lost in GMU work and lost track. I think the student did
something else, like crack RSA-129. But there are lots of students
at schools like MIT and GMU.

I sure hope this can provide a cloud free PGP for broke students.

Lets drop this thread for while, ok?
