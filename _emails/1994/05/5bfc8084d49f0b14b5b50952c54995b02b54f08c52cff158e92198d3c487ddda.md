I hadn't considered this.  My question is answered.

Frankly, I am really not interested in using PGP2.6 IN the U.S.
I am reluctant to support the active restriction of capability in a 
software product by dignifying its underhanded tactics in using it.

More serious efforts at a stealth PGP which makes identification of the 
creator of cyphertext near impossible is badly needed.

I wonder if a Mac version will be available by September.

I wonder if a Mac version of StealthPGP will ever be available.

I wish I had the time/know-how to create one myself.
