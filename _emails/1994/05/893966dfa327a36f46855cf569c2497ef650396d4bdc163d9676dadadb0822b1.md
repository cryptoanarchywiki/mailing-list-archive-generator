Hve you ever been inside IRONMAN or IRONMAN2. The governments
sophistication with secure methods of sending voice and data are
SECURE. IF YOU ARE STUPID ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE CONGRESSMEN
OR SENATORS WOULD STOOP TO SOMETHING THAT WASN'T SECURE THEN I HAVE
A CLIPPER CHIP WITHOUT A BACK DOOR I WANT TO GIVE YOU.

No free man shall ever be de-barred the use of arms. The strongest
reason for the people to retain  there right to keep and bear arms
is as a last  resort to  protect  themselves  against  tyranny  in
government. <-------- Thomas Jefferson                            --
