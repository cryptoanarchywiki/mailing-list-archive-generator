At one of the earlier CSSPAB board meetings, a bunch of law enforcement
officers came to speak about Clipper. They pointed out that 13 states
do not allow their state and local police to use wiretaps. Some officers
surmised that this was because wiretaps are really valuable in cases
of bribery and corruption. I.e. where crimes can be committed through
talking.
