Questions:

1) What involvement, if any, does Phil Zimmermann have in the creation
of this "new version of PGP"?

2) Will "PGP 2.5" continue to be freeware; i.e., has RSA changed its
stance on licensing?

3) If the answer to 2 is "yes", has the strength of the encryption
been compromised in any fashion?

4) Isn't this some sort of transparent "back door" grab by some
unknown person(s) as a method of encouraging people to switch by
fostering the belief that versions of PGP lower than 2.4 are somehow
illegal or otherwise illegitimate?

(The last is only semi-sarcastic.)

Basically, I think I speak for a hefty chunk of list subscribers when
I say: 

I want to know who's behind this.
