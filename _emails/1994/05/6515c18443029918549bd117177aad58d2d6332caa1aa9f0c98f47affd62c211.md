    Three items.  On p.41 at 2/3 page review of Schneier's 
    "Applied Cryptography" favorable if not raving.

    In the What's New Hardware pages:
    The Crypto-Com V.32bis asynchronous pocket modem ($895) from
    Western Datacom (Westlake, OH) encrypts all data transmissions
    between two of the companies modems.  800 262 3311
    [ It uses single DES they said when I called ]

    Lastly a seven page article "Distributed and Secure" by a
    Russell Kay whose bio says he edited Infosecurity News and
    Computer Security Journal.  The box on the front page says
    "When you distribute information and processing, you also
    delegate security responsibility.  Good access controls,
    eyes open administration, and communication encryption can
    make all the difference".   Login control token technology
    is reviewed, Kerberos discussed and explained, PK crypto
    including PGP, and the Andrew file system.

    Something new to me was:
    "... NSA recently placed a large order for what it calls
    'sniffless password generators' with Secure Computing in
    Roseville, Minnesota.
    	With the company's Lockout system, instead of sending a
    password over the wire "in clear,"  you send a cryptographic
    representation of it, using a one time encryption key. Each
    time you login, the password is encrypted with a different key.
    The NSA will use Lockout in conjunction with its Tessera Crypto
    Card, a PCMCIA device. ... It uses both NIST's Digital Signature
    Algorithm and the NSA's Mosaic encryption algorithms."
