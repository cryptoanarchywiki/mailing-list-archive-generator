1) Get source code for MacPGP2.3aV1.1 and alter it to accept the Clipboard
as an input/output option, which it already can do, if operated manually.
Till then we will spool the Clipboard to disk and have MacPGP2.3aV1.1 act
only on files. MacPGP2.3aV1.1 was recently released in Germany, and will act
as our temporary model crypto engine.

This has proved a serious set back.

I would design around MacPGP2.3 v.1.0.5 (or whatever)

The V1.1 source code doesn't look like it will be around real soon.

Cut your losses, and work on v1.0.5
