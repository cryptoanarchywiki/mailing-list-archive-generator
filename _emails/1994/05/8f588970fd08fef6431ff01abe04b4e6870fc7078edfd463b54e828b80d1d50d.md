I just saw something about this on CNN -- they actually showed the Lawrence Liverm
Livermore computers doing the tracking.  The FBI spokesdroid said that in a
military situation, return fire would be automatic, though one would need to
be a bit more careful in a law enforcement situation.

Then again, if they want to put the National Guard in the Anacostia district
of DC, maybe that area or the U-Street corridor in DC will qualify???
