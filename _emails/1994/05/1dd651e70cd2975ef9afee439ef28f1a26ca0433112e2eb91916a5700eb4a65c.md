[disclaimer: I'm not an expert, but I've done some work with patents.]

I believe the best way to ensure that something becomes unpatentable is to:

  1. Publish it first. That reserves your right to file a patent if you
     want. No one else can patent your original work.

  2. Don't file a patent within one year of publication. After one year
     you lose your right to file. No one else can file, because by then
     the invention is considered to be public knowledge (since it was
     published), so it would not satisfy the "original and novel"
     patentability test.

If you keep the process a secret, someone else could independantly invent it and
patent it. If you publish it before someone else files, it becomes public
knowledge and is unpatentable except by the original inventor within one year of
publication.

His whole point was that he wanted to render the process unpatentable.
