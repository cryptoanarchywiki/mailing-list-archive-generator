You think so?  Hm.  I'm just pulling numbers out of the air here,
but...

Let's say the cypherpunk dream is realized, and everyone on the net
uses anonymous mail through a message haven.  I believe there are
20 000 000 InterNet users right now.  Lets say each person sends one
piece of mail every day, and also checks the message haven each day.
Each day there are twenty million new messages on the message haven.
These are downloaded by twenty million people each day.  That's
400 trillion messages that the message haven must send each day.
Let's say the average size of a message is 1Kb.  This gives a 
total of 3 Petabits a day.  At 86400 seconds in a day, this requires
a bandwidth of 30 Terabits/second.

This is, of course, far beyond practicality.  I'm allso being
a little silly here, assuming there is only one message haven
for the world.  With distributed havens the load on each haven
decreases.  However, the load on each recieving terminal is the
same.  Each terminal must process 20 Gigabytes of mail to look for
messages to the user.  Maybe that'll be practical in a few years,
but then again in a few years there will be more internet users.

I'm sorry, I must not have read your post carefully enough.  I understood
there to be no tag outside the encryption wrapper.  I thought you were
implying attempting decryption of every post on the haven until one worked.
My appologies.
