This is a test to see if mail is getting though.

If you get this, there are only about a dozen of us shown on
Majordomo's listing, as you probably already know.

Anybody know what happened? (I can think of some possibilities:
Nalbandian's threatened 12.2 MB mail bomb, someone (LD or JN?)
unsubscribed everyone with Majordomo, or a toad problem unrelated.)

Exciting times in cypherspace.
