This is not quite accurate.

The WELL has one IP feed into the Internet, through BARRNET.  The WELL also
has a private T1 line to a TLG customer, and traffic between the WELL and
TLG is routed through this link.  No packets to the rest of the Internet
are sent through TLG.

At least, that was the case.  I just updated our routing tables to send
TLG traffic through BARRNET like everything else, since that TLG link is
down right now.
