So, you are saying that I will be automatically subject to US law if I 
use this product?  Hmmm, wonder what that does in terms of citizenship 
issues - as far as _I_ am concerned, the only law that has jurisdiction 
for me is NZ law, and US law can go get hanged, no?

On a different note, where are the PKP patents registered, and how?  Are 
they under the Int. Patent Coop. Treaty?  If so, they might have some 
validity here...
