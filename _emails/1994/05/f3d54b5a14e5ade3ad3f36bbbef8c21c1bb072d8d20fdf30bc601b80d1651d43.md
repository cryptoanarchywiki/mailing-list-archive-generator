 And you sir have a netcom feed... as do I... I will be talking with Bob Rieger
about your harassment of other netcom users on this list...
I feel that you WILL lose your accounts with netcom if this HARASSMENT doesnt 
stop. I suggest you think about your highly immature actions of the last week..
a copy of this mail is being forwarded to noc@netcom.com as well as 
bobr@netcom.com... in fact I am sending a copy of ALL of your postings to
netcom management... mailbombing a mailing list IS NOT with in
netcom's AUP(that is Acceptable Use Policy). and IS grounds for revocation of
your accounts on netcom...

     Think about it...
