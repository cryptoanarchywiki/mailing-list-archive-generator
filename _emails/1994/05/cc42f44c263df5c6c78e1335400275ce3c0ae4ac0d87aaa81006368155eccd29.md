I browsed through the (SCANT!) documentation that comes with rsaref-2.0. I
didn't find any decent programming examples, just a list of function
calls, which is next to useless without sample code, but that's beside the
point. 

If I understand D-H right, both sides generate public keys from their
private keys, then just exchange public keys.  Is that right?  Or is there
something I'm missing?
