C'punks,

Once again I'm seeing day-long delays in getting mail, and I don't
know if the problem is at the toad site or at Netcom's end (or at a
relay link in between). Hence this message.

I got a message I posted yesterday only this morning, though several
responses had either appeared on the list or been sent to me directly.
And the messages I posted today have not appeared. Black Unicorn
must've gotten it, as he sent me a note and I've just posted a reply,
even though my original article has not yet come back to me.

If you are gettting mail out of order (replies from others before the
original appears) or delayed by more than several hours, drop me a
note if you would and I will summarize what I learn.

I'm especially interested to hear from Netcom sites.

(Asking Netcom Support about bounced mail is a pointless task, as they
are clueless and consistently deny that mail is bounced even when
presented with bounce logs from other sites. And I don't want to bug
Hugh Daniel about this until I've seen some feedback from others.)
