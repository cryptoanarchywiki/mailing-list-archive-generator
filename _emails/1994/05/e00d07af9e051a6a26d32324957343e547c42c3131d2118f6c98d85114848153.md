With good reason. It's a bullshit product.

And most likely 2.4 as well, although that's a horse of a
different color.

Not quite. It's not *legal* to export it. But to say that it
"can't be exported" is simply untrue. It "can" be exported,
and easily at that. However, I doubt there will be much
demand for it, in or out of the us. It is slower than 2.3a,
has unreasonable limits on keysize, and is not backwards
compatable with the versions much of the world uses.

Or with users in the usa or canada who choose to use 2.3a.
(and possibly 2.4 as well? Any confirm or deny on this one?)

A total waste of time. Any 'foreign users' who wish it will
be able to get a copy of 2.6 in short order. But that's
still not going to change the fact that it's not a
worthwhile program.

The word to describe what has happened is "disaster". It is
a deliberate attempt to fragment the international crypto
community.

It will be "over" when I can use whatever encryption I
choose to protect my communication, without the requirement
of government of corperate 'approval' to avoid "legal trouble"

I _explicitly_ condemn the _decisions_ of whoever wrote the
damn program to:
        1)disallow keys bigger than 1024bits
        2)remove backwards-compatable operation

I have not yet heard prz's position regarding the
limitations on pgp version 2.6, however if he supports it I
simply disagree with him.
