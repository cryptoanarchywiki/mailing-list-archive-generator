I was talking to a definite non-cypherpunk friend of mine
today, and he and I came up with something that might help
some Mac users with pgp... The way we were thinking about it
is that in your pgp directory, er, folder, you would have
several Icons in adition to pgp it'sself. One would be a
picture of a lock, with the name "encrypt" and to encrypt a
file you simply "pick up" the file and "drag" it over to
"drop" it on the encrypt icon. Poof, encrypted file is
produced (sure it would ask for passwords and stuff, and it
would ask first who to encrypt it to, with the users own
pubkey the default. Another Icon would be a picture of a key
with the word decrypt, any cyphertext file droped on it
would be decrypted. Another one would be a picture of a
fountain pen with the name 'sign', yet another would be a
magnifying glass over a piece of paper to 'examine sig' or
whatever (yes you nit-pickers, I know that functionaly the
decrypt and the sig check are like identicle, but the users
have a hard time understanding that sometimes.) The point is
that someone with some knowledge of macintosh programing
hopefully can create what in unix would be a link to the pgp
program, whereby it would just call pgp with certain options
enabled depending on what name you called it under...

Happy Hunting, -Chris
