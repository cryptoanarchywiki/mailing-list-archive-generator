Patent it yourself. Or publish extensively, with source code, etc. In the
US, where patents are still invent-first rather than file-first, this will 
make it harder for someone else to patent it. If you publish it, it can be
taken as prior art, in which case claims on it will be rejected. 

I'm not a patent lawyer, consult one.
