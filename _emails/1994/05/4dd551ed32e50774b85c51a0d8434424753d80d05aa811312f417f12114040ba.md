AE means Apple Event.  If the new MacPGP supports Apple Events, that makes
it scriptable, which is a wonderful thing.  It means that I can (as I can
do with RIPEM Mac today) pull down a menu in my mail reader, Eudora, and
have a message encrypted or signed automatically.

However, it appears to still be the infringing 2.3 code, which I won't run,
given that I do live in the US.  Let me know when a Mac version of 2.5/2.6
is out.
