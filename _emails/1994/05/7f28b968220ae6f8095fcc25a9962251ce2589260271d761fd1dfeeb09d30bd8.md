When are you people going to wake up (NEVER as long as you are not
in the real world). The congress and house may legislate what ever
they want. Your best insurance against the clipper chip is people
having good back-door less freeware cryptography programs that
educates them on why Clipper is a bum deal. Screw all the
judiciary crap. If Mr and Mrs computer user doesn't have access to
it they never will. They DO NOT have a FUCKING CLUE as to what a
BBS and FTP or AN ESCROWED KEY account is. Much less being a
COMPUTER ILLUMINATTI like you are. The power is with the public.
