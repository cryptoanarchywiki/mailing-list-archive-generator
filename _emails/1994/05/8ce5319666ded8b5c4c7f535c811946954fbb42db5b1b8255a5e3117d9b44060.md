Let me just make a couple of comments here, and you can decide if what I 
can offer is what you need.

I will be putting a low-end workstation online in a couple of weeks 
(mid-june).  By the end of june, I should have any bugs in the OS worked 
out, a good backup made, and the machine should be ready to do stuff 
with (I'm being overly generous on the time, just in case).  This will be 
an ethernetted workstation, not SLIPed, so connectivity is no problem.

Now, what I can do is install Majordomo and set up any mailing lists that 
are needed.  Eric suggested in private mail that perhaps a series of 
regional cypherpunks lists would be helpful for planning of physical 
meetings and the like.  I can, of course, also set up lists for the CEB 
project.  Each list will have its own administrator that IS NOT me :-)

Majordomo also appears (I havn't fully groked it yet) to support file 
archives using a 'get' parameter, so any files that are produced can be 
made available via the same software, or some other software if it 
becomes available.  I can help with the setup of the software as well. 

I _am not_ willing to administrate the CEB, though.  I know that in the 
near future I just wouldn't have time.  Besides, I've got a book that was 
due last week (got a month reprieve :-) and two more that I am working 
on, and that is enough playing editor for any man's sanity.  This, coupled 
with my new admin job working for the city, just kills my free time.

I may (maybe) be able to make an account available to the editor, but the 
machine itself is not very capable beyond the above, so you wouldn't be 
getting much out of it except a platform to hack from :-)

Assuming no problems, I shoudl have everything ready to go with the above 
in about a month, perhaps a little less.

Let me know if that would work.
