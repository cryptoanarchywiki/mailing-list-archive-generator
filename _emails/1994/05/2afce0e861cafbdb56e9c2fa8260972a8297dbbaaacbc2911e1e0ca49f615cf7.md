On this subject (really from the original post about money), I have several
times tried to convince people that the Federal Reserve Bank is a private
deal.  I don't know where I got this impression, but no one will believe
me.

Are there some conspicuous facts that I could quote in support of this
position?  Or, perhaps, an easily obtained and authoritative document which
explains just what the heck the Fed really is?

I know the head is apppointed by the US gov, but my impression was that the
rest of it was just a consortium of bankers to whom the national debt is
owed.

thanks,
tw
