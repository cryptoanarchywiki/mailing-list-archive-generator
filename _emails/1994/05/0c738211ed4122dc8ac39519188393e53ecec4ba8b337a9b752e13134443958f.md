Well, if the cypherpunks "dream" is realized then there won't be a
need for message havens since anonymous mail will be accepted
net-wide.  People wouldn't go after anonymous remailer operators
because somebody harrassed another person.

But back to the problem at hand...

Your analysis is interesting, but so far fetched I'm not going to
worry about it.  I mean, yes, if the 5 billion people of earth decide
to do this, or decide to call each other, or decide to send each other
snail mail, everything will collapse.  Considering this as a worst
case, in my opinion, is a waste for right now, and will deter useful
work before it even starts.

Planning for this is about as useful as worrying about all 20 million
net users will access the same Mosaic page, the same gopher site, the
same ftp site, etc.

I just don't expect traffic to be that heavy.  And I base it on
personal experience from running anonymous remailers.

Plus, it is ONLY necessary to retreive all messages if you don't want
it know who you are communicating with.  If you don't care if it is
known you communicate with some psuedonym, then you don't have to get
all the messages.  The primary goal is to not mail messages out since
that is where most the complaints against anonymous remailers lie.
