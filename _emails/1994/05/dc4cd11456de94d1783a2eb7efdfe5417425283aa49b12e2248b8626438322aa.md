So all those aliens who want to legally receive "munitions" within the US 
can form a US "corporation, business association, partnership, society, 
trust, or any other entity organization or group including governmental 
entities" and have that institution which would legally be a "US person" 
receive the "munitions."

In fact, I think that the multiplication of entities can be a useful 
tool.  Transfering your car or your assault rifles to corporations formed 
in convenient jurisdictions can be a good way to dodge regulations that 
apply to "persons" within a particular jurisdiction.  Note that under the 
current assault weapons control legislation you are supposed to record 
the sale of your weapons over time.  If they are owned by a corporation, 
they need never be transfered.  The corporation can be transferred instead.
