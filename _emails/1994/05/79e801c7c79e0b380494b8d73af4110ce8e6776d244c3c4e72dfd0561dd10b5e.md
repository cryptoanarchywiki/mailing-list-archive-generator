What they certainly _do_ recognize, however, is that a person who _does_
agree to the PGP 2.5 terms has affirmed that he _is_ a national person.
This could be used by a court to negate any subsequent denial by the
person that he is a subject of the United States of America or Canada.
The absence on one's record of such affirmations is a prerequisite for
freeman status.
