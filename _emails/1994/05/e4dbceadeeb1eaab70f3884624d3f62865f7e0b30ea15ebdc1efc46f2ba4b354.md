I haven't had time to scan the list recently, so someone else may already 
have brought this up, but in case no one has, I want to launch an 
anti-clipper meme:

A government mandante for key-escrow encryption in all communication 
devices would be the information-age equivalent of the government requiring 
private citizens to quarter troups in their home.
