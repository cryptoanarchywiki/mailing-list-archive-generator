      I dunno. The paper by LaMacchia and Odlysko on how to break
      Diffie-Hellman quickly once you've done a lot of precomputation on a
      static modulus is sufficiently disturbing to me that I would prefer to
      be able to change modulii fairly frequently if possible.

   Quoting K. McCurley about the above mentioned work: "Their experience
   seems to suggest that it is possible to compute discrete logarithms in
   groups GF(p)^* with p \wavyequals 10^100." [in _The Discrete Logarithm
   Problem_, collected in _Cryptology and Computational Number Theory_]

Right.  Basically, what we found was that you needed the same amount of
computation to factor a (k+10)-digit composite as to compute discrete
logarithms in a field with k-digit modulus p.  The discrete log problem
is brittle---you do a lot of precomputation for a particular modulus p
and then finding individual discrete logs in GF(p) is easy---so you
need to think carefully about the lifetime of the information you're
going to encrypt and choose the size of your modulus accordingly.
