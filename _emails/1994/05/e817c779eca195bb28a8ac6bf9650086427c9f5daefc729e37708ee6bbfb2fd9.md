Well, Hal wanted to bet me too, but you were first.  If he's still
willing, I'll agree to him also.

Agreed.

Agreed.

I'm a University programmer/sysadmin.  I.e., poor, but with a good
InterNet connection. :)

Sounds fine with me.  If Hal, or another agreed upon judge is willing,
I'll send my cheque in.
