I'm taking it that a "gopherhole" is different than the "message
haven" I described, so maybe I missed something...

but if the "gopherhole" sends out random messages (and presumably the
ones you are interested in) then the "gopherhole" will eventually be
able to figure out what messages you are interested in.  And how would
it know what messages you are interested in unless you tell it... it
would then need to be able to tie your psuedonym to your real mail
address, which defeats the entire purpose of what I described.  But
then, maybe the design goal of a "gopherhole" is different and I
missed it.

Maybe I wasn't clear in what the "message haven" offered... I'm trying
to get away from the penet style mapping tables, persistent
information tying you and your pseudonym, and solve the "unsolicited
anonymous mail" problem.  The message haven requires no trust, no
tables, no information since it just accepts message and files them,
and if you retrieve all the message, the haven can't figure out which
ones you are interested in!
