I agree that Unicorn's tone was bullying, but, if as stated, Unicorn
received calls from clients asking about the rumors ...then...tmp had
done real ( if inadvertent ) damage...

What remains unexplained is how the rumor spread so fast through so many

As for insiders, well, a business insider will use the law, a net
insider might use other means.  Insiders, like anyone, use what they
know best.
