> Hello:
>
> On June 1, 1994, CustomWare of Toronto will be releasing a freeware newton
> application called "nCrypt". nCrypt provides "strong" encryption for newton
> objects including notes and names.
>
> The freeware version of nCrypt will provide password protection for newton
> objects and is intended for use as a personal privacy utility. A commercial
> version to follow will also implement "public key" protocols for digital
> signature authentication and key distribution similar to PowerTalk,
> RIPEM/SIG, PGP and RIPEM.
>
> nCrypt also suppports "drop in" encryption modules for adding compatibility
> with other encryption systems.
>
> Interested developers may contact CustomWare about writing encryption
> modules or for testing their apps with nCrypt for compatibility. The
> algorithms used by nCrypt will be made available in a technical note for
> review. There may even be another of those cash prizes for breaking the
> system...
