I have seen your posts about the "GhostMark" bank. How is this doing?
How many coins have you issued, and how many transactions are you getting?
Are you running the transactions by hand, or do you have it automated?

Somebody here (mpd?) had compiled it for the mac. The user interface
was still text-based, but they said it worked.

Problem there: the spent list doesn't record the value of the coin.
Only the number. So you can't pull it out of the spent list. If you
want accounting info, you will have to modify the code to write some
information to a file as the coins are exchanged. Not too hard to do,
but you can't get the data after-the-fact from the spent list.
