The trading of ghostmarks has begun. I've personally been party to a 
half-dozen transactions from my own personal account, and have more than 
20 clients. 

It's time for trade to begin large-scale. I've placed the names of those 
clients who agreed to be publicly listed on my finger info: 

phantom@stein.u.washington.edu

These are people (although not the only ones) that are ready and willing
to begin transactions. Each of them has some sort of supply of ghostmarks.

Let the grand experiment begin.
