[With apologies -- no, it's not cryptography.]

Considering the wide variety of gun noises and urban noise
artifacts, a lot of false alarms would be expected.  On the other
hand some of them might be worth responding to from the police
perspective.  It might be preferable to respond to firecrackers
early in the evening and discourage accidental or deliberate
arson later.

The above is is a bit of an oversimplification.  Most of what these
gadgets would be listening for are .22/.32/.38/9mm/.45 etcetera.
9mm and 22LR could easily be supersonic, but the other common
ones tend to be slower.  .45ACP, for example, is usually in the
900fps range (or slower), and won't give any sonic signature other
than the shot itself.

As several people pointed out, arming a mechanical device would be
litigationally unacceptable.  Worry about it when private
security firms are allowed to employ mine fields.  Furthermore,
how long would an audio monitor last in the company of a
stealable weapon?  15 minutes?  A more reasonable concern would be
future "upgrades" of the system for greater sensitivity and a wider
range of uses.
