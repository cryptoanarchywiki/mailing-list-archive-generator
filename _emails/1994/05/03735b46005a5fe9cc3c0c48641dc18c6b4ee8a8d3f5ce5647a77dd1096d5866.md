It is extremely good and easy to use, the only problem is that the 
largest device/file it creates correctly is about 8megs... I now have 
virtual drives d-m each as 8meg encrypted files, and I would much rather 
have one 80 meg partition... oh well. Aside from that it is one of the 
best encryption programs I have ever used.

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
