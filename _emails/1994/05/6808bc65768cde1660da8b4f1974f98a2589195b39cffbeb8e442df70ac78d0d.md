    Despite the patent & licensing issues being resolved, PGP is still
    not legally exportable from the United States (except to Canada),
    due to ITAR export restrictions which categorize cryptographic
    materials as weapons of war.  Thus, EFF can only make PGP and
    other crypto tools and source code available to US and Canadian
    nationals currently residing in the US or Canada and connecting to
    EFF's site from a US or Canadian site.

I was under the impression that NAFTA is the reason that Canada is
included.  Am I misinformed?  If NAFTA is the reason, isn't Mexico
equivalent to Canada in this context?  Could someone clarify this
aspect of the export situation, or perhaps point me at a document that
explains the situation?
