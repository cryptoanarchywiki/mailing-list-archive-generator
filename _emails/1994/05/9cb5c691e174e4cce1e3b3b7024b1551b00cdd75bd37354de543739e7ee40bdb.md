/ | It is my understanding that folk outside the USA can legally run
/PGP | versions from 2.0 to 2.3a, but cannot legally run Viacrypt
/2.4 or the | RSAREF-based version 2.5, because they contain code
/that cannot be | exported from the USA.  Thus, it appears that the
/keyserver will not | accept any legally created keys from outside
/the USA.  I think that this | is a bad thing.

/        I think folks outside the US can legally run 2.4 or 2.5, as
/there are no restrictions in their countries on using that
/software. The difficulty is getting it outside of the US without
/getting anyone in trouble.


I think if cryptography is illegal it does't mater a FUCK what
version the program is. Insure against the inevetable by
distributing to the DUMM FUCK CLUELESS COMPUTER USERS THAT ARE NOT
AS FUCKIN' COOL AS YOU ARE. Power to the people/power in the people
