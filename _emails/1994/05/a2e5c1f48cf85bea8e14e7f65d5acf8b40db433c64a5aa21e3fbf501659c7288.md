I agree it is difficult to determine Detweiler's motivations; I've
carried on quite civil email exchanges with him... but the posts from
tmp@netcom.com are quite bizzare.

Anyway, I was looking thought this months PC Techniques articles on
Secret Sharing, Simple Encryption (XOR), and Subliminal Channels, when
I flipped through Connect magazine... and was stunned to see the
article "Cryptography for the Unwashed Masses" by L. Detweiler!

The article is calm, reasonable, explains the rudiments of crypto
(keeping in mind the target audience), and in general pro crypto.  So
while he may have it in for cypherpunks stuff, he seems to be
supporting cryptography.
