What will we have to do to get MIT-PGP 2.6 via anonymous ftp from
net-dist.mit.edu?

Like with MIT-PGP 2.5, telnet to net-dist.mit.edu, and answer questions.
This time there are 4.  The first three questions help MIT protect itself
from possible legal problems related to their distributing PGP - they
cover their rear ends with regard to ITAR regs (questions 1 and 2) and
patent infringement (question 3).

First, we must assure net-dist that we're not trying to export MIT-PGP 2.6.
Second, we must promise not to export MIT-PGP 2.6. Third, we must agree to
the terms and conditions in the RSAREF license. Finally, we must agree
that we won't use MIT-PGP 2.6 for commercial purposes.  A "yes" answer to
that last question is the only thing specifically required by the RSAREF
license.

Note well that we aren't required to obey strictures in some kind of
"README" file.  Remember this for when someone tries to muddy the waters
with baseless obfuscatory claims about what we agreed to in some auxiliary
file, and how that auxiliary file somehow overrules the license terms.
:-)

I find the RSAREF license quite reasonable, as I did their previous
version.  I have not yet seen the MIT license.  I don't know about the
source, because I haven't grabbed it yet.
