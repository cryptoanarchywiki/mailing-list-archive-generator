This restrcition comes from RSAREF code, over which the PGP team had no 
control.

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but to me the development of a 
free, legal, source code version of PGP is such a positive development 
that it easily outweighs any of the problems (key sigs, incompatibility 
with big keys, etc.) that the new release has brought about.  When the 
jump from verison 1 to verison 2 was made, everyone's key became 
obsolete, and everyone survived.  Everyone will survive this time, too.

I'm also very pleased with some of the new features (like the default for 
PGPPATH, which will make PGP a lot more accessible to casual users).
