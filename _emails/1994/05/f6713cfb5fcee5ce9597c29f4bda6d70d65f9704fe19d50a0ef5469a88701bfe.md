Well, I'll look at what Schneier says; maybe there is a typo in the
formula... but the way you can solve this is with the Chinese
Remainder Theorem.

If c = m^2 mod n, then a solution is a common solution of

m^2 mod n = c mod p
m^2 mod n = c mod q

Since p+1 and q+1 are divisible by 4, then (a^((p+1)/4))^2 = a since a
is a quadratic residue modulo p, and then a^((p-1)/2) mod p = 1

anyway, you calculate x1 = a^((p+1)/4) mod p
                      x2 = a^((q+1)/4) mod q

and then use the CRT four times to get the solution.

For this example, p = 7, q = 11, n = p q = 77, m = 50

c = 50^2 mod 77 = 36

x1 = c^((p+1)/4) mod p = 36^2 mod 7  = 1
x2 = c^((q+1)/4) mod q = 36^3 mod 11 = 5

So now you use the Chinese Remainder Theorem for the following four
cases

CRT(n, p, q, x1, x2)
CRT(n, p, q, x1, q - x2)
CRT(n, p, q, p - x1, q)
CRT(n, p, q, p - x1, q - x1)

yeilding:

CRT(77, 7, 11, 1, 5) --> 71
CRT(77, 7, 11, 1, 6) --> 50
CRT(77, 7, 11, 6, 5) --> 27
CRT(77, 7, 11, 6, 6) --> 6

Sorry, but I don't have time to write out the steps for the CRT ;)
It's pretty straightforward, given the algorithm.

so (71, 50, 27, 6) satisfy the equation x^2 mod n = c
                                        x^2 mod 77 = 36

as you can see, the original message (m = 50) is one of the choices.

This is similar to an oblivious transfer protocol.  Actually, I think
it is an oblivious transfer as described by Blum.
