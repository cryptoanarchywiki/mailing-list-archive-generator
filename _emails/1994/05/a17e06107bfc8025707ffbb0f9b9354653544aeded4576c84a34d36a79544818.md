When 2.5 was first announced a few weeks ago (with the non infamous 
keyserver announcement), there was some concerns expressed over the 
political manipulations of the new program and thus, the overall security 
of the code.  To this date I haven't seen any additional commentary on 
that subject, and I figure that before I recommend locally changing to 
2.5, I'd like to find out what exactly was changed from the standpoint of 
the algoritms and the overall safety of them.

No flame please, but I am not a math-oriented person, so please keep it 
in pseudo-english :-)
