This almost sounds like you are calling for liberation from the 
Constitution of the United States.  In this regard your position closely 
resembles the anti-federalist doctrines.  Although it is a position with 
which I cannot agree, I do respect it as one with much scholarly support.

I think it's difficult to accomplish what you propose.  This seems to me 
to amount to calling for the status of sovereignty to apply to every 
individual.  A system of individual sovereignty strikes me as unworkable, 
and again a slippery slope to complete lawlessness.  I'd like to head 
that way, just not ALL the way there.

I guess I'm not sure what the solution here is other than to grant 
citizenship on the basis that it is granted today.  Jus Soli or Jus 
Sangre.  How a legal infant can decide the state of citizenship for him 
or herself is a difficult proposition.  At the age of majority there 
exist a great number of options and several nations which grant 
citizenship on basic requirements.  In addition one can always become 
stateless.  Any social organization will be coercive by the standards you 
have set down as I understand them.  Protections for the collective 
always intrude on the individual.  I am not prepared to defend the 
position of absolute individuality as a natural right.

I agree.  However, the problem with the rather nebulous and elusive 
"spirit" of the ideas in the Constitution is that committing them to the
social memory almost insures their erasure in a number of generations 
less than the number of fingers on the hand of an expert woodshop 
vet.  In addition, the short term politics I mentioned before cause a 
problem.  There are certain concepts that are expressed in the language 
of the Constitution that I think are timeless.  These include but are not 
limited to:  The right to bear arms.  The right against self incrimination.
Applying these to the current era is the task, not modifying their basic 
content.

I agree in theory.  In practice I must dissent.  I still maintain that 
social organizations demand some degree of sacrifice.  Provided the 
borders are not closed to those who wish to leave, and there is a 
"market" of sovereigns to choose from, I don't find the power 
of a sovereign in itself offensive.  What I feel is the obligation of the 
sovereign is to limit the level of corruption of the individual by 
forebearing from unneeded exertions of authority.
