## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}From: Mike Ingle <MIKEINGLE@delphi.com>
Date: Mon, 9 May 94 11:18:43 PDT
To: cypherpunks@toad.com
Subject: List crash/deleted?
Message-ID: <01HC4ZNS9Y1G935VV3@delphi.com>

What happened?

1: A software bug ate the file.
2: Someone hacked toad and deleted everyone.
3: Someone obtained a list of members and forged unsubscribes from 
   everyone.

Anyone know for sure? If it was forged unsubscribes, the sendmail logs
should show where it came from...

Some people have asked about the message I sent out. That was sent to
everyone who posted in the last two weeks or so. I had those posts in
files and used the from: lines as a distribution list.
