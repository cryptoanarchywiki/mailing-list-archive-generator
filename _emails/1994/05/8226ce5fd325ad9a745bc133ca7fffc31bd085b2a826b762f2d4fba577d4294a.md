Not that I don't agree with the basic premise, of course, but there's
a similar risk to *any* consumer electronics implementation of a
cryptosystem.  Of course, in Clipper/Skipjack's case the problem is
magnified by the fact that the stuff is kept secret, but the potential
remains.

However, a software-based consumer communicator will probably end up
implying at least as much weight in people's pockets, and as much
extra money, as Clipper.

I don't think an economic argument will really fly well, though I'd
love to be shown to be way wrong.  Seems to me that a mass-produced
chip whose production is subsidized by the government would probably
be pretty cheap.
