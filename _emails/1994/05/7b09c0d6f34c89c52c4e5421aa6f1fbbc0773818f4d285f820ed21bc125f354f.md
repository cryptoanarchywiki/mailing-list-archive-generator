    At three sites around the world the hyperdsk.zip file (204,864 bytes)
    contains only the .exe without any documentation.
  
    In January Edgar W. Swank mentioned WIPIT100.ZIP to wipe
    all free space on your disk. Its free for personal use.
    I haven't found it though, with Archie searches. 

    There are of course the Norton Utilities too, but not free.
