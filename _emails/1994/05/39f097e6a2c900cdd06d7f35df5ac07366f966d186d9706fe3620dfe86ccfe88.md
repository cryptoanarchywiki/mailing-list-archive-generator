   In response to a request, to have canrem.com added to MIT's list of
Canadian sites, I've just received a response indicating that pgp 2.5
has been removed from the MIT servers.

   The message states that PGP 2.6 will be released, probably next
week, after a new release of rsaref is out.  The new version will
be "upgraded", to be incompatible with earlier versions, in order
to protect the patent rights of rsadsi.

   Regards, Dave Hodgins.
