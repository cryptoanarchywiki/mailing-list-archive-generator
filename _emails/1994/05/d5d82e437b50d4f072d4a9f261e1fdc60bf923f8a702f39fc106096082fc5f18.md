I suppose your student only knew basic command line navigating, maybe
how to create a directory, fire up emacs, etc.?

Um, that is a pretty far from the mark I had in mind.

Imagine the 'techno-savvy' score of the next person on this earth to
pick up a phone, a person who doesn't know how to dial an
international call.

I want everybody on this earth to have secure crypto (so I can talk to
them), and if the current PGP is as easy as it gets...
