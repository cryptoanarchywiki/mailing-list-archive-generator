I know.  That is why it should be done using a secure marketing channel. 
One could probably get away with handing copies out on the street as well.
 Probably protected activity.  You wouldn't get many hits that way,
however.  ("Hits" defined as crypto in the hands of people who can figure
out how to use it.

Generally, neither unlicensed gambling nor the unlicensed retail
pharmacutical trade are activities disapproved of by the readers of this
list.  On the other hand, government enforcement actions directed at
individuals practicing those trades *are* disapproved of.

In any case, I have developed a protocol that would allow the sale of
contraband with almost no risk to the seller and reduced risk to the
buyer.  It's based on modern drop shipping techniques.  I intend to
publish same when/if tobacco is criminalized.
