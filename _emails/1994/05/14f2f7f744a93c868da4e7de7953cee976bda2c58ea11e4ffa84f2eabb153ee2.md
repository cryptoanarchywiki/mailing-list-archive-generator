This is sick. According to this, I cannot teach foreigners about
cryptography in the U.S. -- even about the open literature. This is a
grotesque denial of my first amendment rights.

I wonder if I should hold an open enrollment cryptography class for
the sake of civil disobediance.

That's interesting..... My cryptology lecturer seems to have an American
Mid-West accent (not Canadian - I can generally tell), and seems to be
commiting the "heinous" crime of teaching such matters to mainly Australian
people. He seems to be on conference somewhere overseas. Well, I hope he
doesn't get arrested if he crosses any U.S. border posts. It would certainly
piss me off. (For one thing, it would fuck up my syllabus :-[.)

	Seriously, I don't think it is an offense to teach cryptology to
non-NAFTA nationals. All of the stuff is non-classified, and he seems pretty
aware of the legal issue of cryptology. That is, he wouldn't do anything
that he could be nabbed for (discounting any warped interprepation of the
legal statutes...;-(   .)
