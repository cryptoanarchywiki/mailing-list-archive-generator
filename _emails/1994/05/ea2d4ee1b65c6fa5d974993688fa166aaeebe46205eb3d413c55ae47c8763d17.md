   The thing is, though, that PGP 2.5 *doesn't* infringe on the patent,
   because of the use of RSAREF.  

I think the broad silence from MIT and RSADSI on the subject of PGP
2.5 after the initial announcement means that this was a matter of
debate and that there were some serious negotiations going on between
the two.  I hope this means that the 2.5/2.6 time-delayed
incompatibility is a bone thrown to RSADSI to get them to support
*some* version of PGP.. which means that everyone in the U.S. (except
the government) will be happy afterwards.

A comment I heard from someone close to the situation was that the
2.5->2.6 format changes will be *very* small, and will be publically
documented in an "ITAR-proof" document.
