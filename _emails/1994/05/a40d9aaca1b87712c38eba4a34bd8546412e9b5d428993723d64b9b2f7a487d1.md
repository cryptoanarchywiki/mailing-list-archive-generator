C'punks,

An open letter to Jim Nalbandian:

Dear Asshole,

This will be my last communications to you (unless you apologize to this 
list, that is).  You are not worth any more of my time.

You complain that we "elitists" aren't making strong crypto available to 
the great unwashed.  Bullshit.  We are and you *aren't*.

I have written an article about PGP for Future Sex magazine.  I ghosted a
similar article and assisted in research on another for a financial
privacy newsletter that targets conservative, wealthy doctors and
businessmen.  I am writing yet another crypto article for Soldier of 
Fortune.  These are in addition to relevant articles I have written for 
Mondo 2000 and Wired.  All these article gave or will give information 
about how to get PGP on a disk through the mail, in addition to FTP sites.

On the other hand, Mr. power-to-the-people jailbird, it looks as though you 
haven't done diddly squat.  Cypherpunks write code and take other actions 
to promote strong crypto.  You want to be a Cypherpunk?  Climb down out 
of the pulpit and lend a hand.  Otherwise, shut the fuck up.

Kindest regards,


 S a n d y
