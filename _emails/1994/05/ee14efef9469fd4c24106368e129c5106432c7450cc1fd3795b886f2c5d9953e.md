Not true.  The problem is copyright, which is honored by Berne Convention
signers even if they don't have software patents or patent-after-publishing
rules like the US.  This includes Europe, the U.S., and many other places.
ViaCrypt 2.4 is copyrighted by ViaCrypt, and RSAREF is copyrighted by RSA,
so you won't be able to use 2.5 source outside the US either; not sure about
binaries.

There's an easy cure for this, though - if some non-North-American wants to
write an RSAREF-compatible software package in C and distribute it as freeware,
then it can be used in non-US versions of things that require RSAREF.

An interesting question is whether PGP 2.5 will include any restrictions
on the non-RSAREF portions of the source code, like not talking to earlier
PGPs, or the RSAREF interface glue not being exportable or whatever.
But we'll see real soon.
