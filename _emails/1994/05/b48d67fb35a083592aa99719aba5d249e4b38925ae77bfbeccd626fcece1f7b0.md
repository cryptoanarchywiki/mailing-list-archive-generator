Do a man filter.  If you need more help, mail me.  It's fairly simple, but
I'm offline reading mail on my Mac, so I don't have access to the

ObCrypt:  I just got my copy of Applied Cryptography.  It looks great.  Now
if only Bruce were in the country so I could mail and get the disks so I
don't have to type all the code in. :-)
