Well Cypherpunkers,
	As the semester comes to an end, I have to sign off the list to prevent 
the unwanted buildup of "list-mail-itis". Therefore, I must say good-bye, for now.
	I will sign off the list in a day or so, but until then, I have a 
(hopefully) simple question for you....

	Does anyone know how to make a kill file for VAX/VMS? I know it's not 
really pertinent to this topic, but I know that all of you guys (and gals) are 
pretty experienced, so I hope that someone knows. Let me know via  private mail if 
you can help me out.
