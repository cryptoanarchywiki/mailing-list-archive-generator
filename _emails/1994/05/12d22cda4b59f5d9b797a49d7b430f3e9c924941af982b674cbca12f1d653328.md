I forgot to add: as there were 700+ members, and most of them lurked and
rarely posted, and Mike Ingle only sent his announcement to those who had 
posted in the last 2 weeks, it would be unfair to assume that those who 
haven't resubscribed are uninterested. A few have posted to the list that 
they didn't receive Mike's mail, and rejoined after querying majordomo, etc.
Others may still be wondering whether it's just low traffic, or a toad.com
problem, and not deduce that they've been unsubscribed.
