Someone suggested this might merely be a diskcacheing program without any 
encryption ability at all.

It is entirely possible that I am mistaken about the programs name, and 
have seized on hyperdsk.zip erroniously.

Does anyone recall a program of similar sounding title in MSDOS land 
which supported encryption?

Again, though I cannot really put a finger on it until the method is 
identified, it seems this will shed a good deal of light into federal law 
enforcement cryptanalysis abilities.
