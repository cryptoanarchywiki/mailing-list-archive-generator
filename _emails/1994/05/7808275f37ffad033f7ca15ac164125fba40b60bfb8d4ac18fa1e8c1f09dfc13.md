Bad credit or no credit.  Having no record in the credit databases is
as good as have negative entries, for many purposes.

A significant part of this is that banks have simply moved out of a
lot of neighboorhoods, and checking accounts are simply not easily
available.  Many people grow up without interaction with the banking
system, and therefore don't get electronified.
