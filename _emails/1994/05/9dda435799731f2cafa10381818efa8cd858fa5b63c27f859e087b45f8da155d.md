Okay. "Writing code" is the activism of choice here, as opposed
to speaking out, spreading the word to Joe Sixpack, etc. No
problem.

First: There have been many non-code discussions over the last
few months, many of them begun by respected list members (Tim
May, Eric Hughes, etc).

Second: If something is posted to the list that you find stupid,
you all SAY that we should just ignore them. But of course, you
post this itself to the list at large. Which prompts another
round of go-between, attack and counter-attack. You say that the
"clueless" need to get thicker skins? Pot calls kettle black,
film at 11.

You accuse the clueless of wasting time and bandwidth, and then
perform the same thing (in a far superior fashion, of course,
since your spelling and grammar skills show you to be a better
person anyway).

In a nutshell: If it's not related to the list, DON'T POST IT.
Take the crap to e-mail.

ignoring his own advice for the first (and hopefully last) time.
