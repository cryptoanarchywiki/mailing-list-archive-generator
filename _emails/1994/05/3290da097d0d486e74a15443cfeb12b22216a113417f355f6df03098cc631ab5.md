Version 1.99 of my Remail for Waffle actually does this:
it checks if the recipient of the remailed message has a
PGP public key, and if so, it encrypts the outgoing message,
if it is not encrypted already.

The remailers remail@vox.hacktic.nl and remailer@jpunix.com
use this program. For testing you can also use
remail@desert.hacktic.nl, or remailer@desert.hacktic.nl
