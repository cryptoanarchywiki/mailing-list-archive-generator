The May 9th Info Week (now being distributed on news stands) has an 
article on using the Internet for funds transfer.

"these banks could save millions by not having to build expensive private 
networks, and the Internet...could become the backbone of worldwide 
electronic commerce.

Photo of and interview with Daniel Schutzer Citicorp VP.

I had breakfast with Shutzer last Fall.  He follows this list among others 
and is up to speed with the institutional changes under way.  He thinks it 
will be a real challenge for conventional banks to survive.
