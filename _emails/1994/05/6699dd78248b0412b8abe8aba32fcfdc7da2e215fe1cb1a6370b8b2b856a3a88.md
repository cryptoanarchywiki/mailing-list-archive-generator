[...] Something did snap, and it did so
with the death of Richard Nixon. On thinking of his achievements, and the
way he was savagely hounded by the left all his life (not without cause, but
not deserving of the extreme demonizing he got), I decided it was time to
stop pussy-footing around here, and start calling jerks, cowards, hoodlums,
and defamers for what they were.
