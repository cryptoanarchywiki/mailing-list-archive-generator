none excistant, all cash deposits above 20.000 guilders will be
                reported to the authorities.

:preferred legal entities: private or public NV (can have bearer shares)
	
public= NV, private= BV, you can also incorporate in Delaware [=Inc] or
use another overseas "model" as long as you register with the local
Chambers of Commerce. You then save 40.000 guilders in capital.
	
:taxes: complex, high (many loopholes for large offshore companies)

a 40% corporate tax in profits till 250.000 guilders, the rest is
taxed at 35%.  In the Netherlands it is possible to discuss a
prospective transaction with the tax authorities and obtian a ruling
wich will determine its tax treatment.

:tax treaties: many
