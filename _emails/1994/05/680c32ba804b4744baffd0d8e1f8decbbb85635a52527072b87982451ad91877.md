	I'd just like to comment that this is a pretty damned sick
allegation against the gun-control folks.  Most of them are pretty
bleeding heart, and I really can't see any of them encouraging someone
to go out & shoot up a playground to get gun control laws passed.

	Lets please not get into the politics of gun control, but I
did want to respond to one of the more offensive and lame suggestions
thrown to the list in recent memory.

Politics.  From the greek "poly," meaning many, and ticks, a small,
annoying bloodsucker.

Have you signed the anti-Clipper petition?
