	Based on what evidence Mark? That article was based almost entirely
on opinions, and on a survey conducted regarding people "dreaming up their
ideal machine". Based on that kind of flimsy, anecdotal evidence
you would say the portrayal of men, women and computer usage
 was an accurate one? I hope to God you're not a scientist.....
because with proof like that, you'd never get anything done. Do you still
believe in the tooth fairy Mr. Carter? People said he/she exists too..
