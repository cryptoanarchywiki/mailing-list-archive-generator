I have a paper that I am preparing for publication called "Trust
Models" that discusses the difference between PGP & PEM and looks
towards a synthesis of these two models.  Since it is not yet
published, I will only send it to those who agree (1) not to
rebroadcast it, and (2) send me their thoughts on it.

Peace
