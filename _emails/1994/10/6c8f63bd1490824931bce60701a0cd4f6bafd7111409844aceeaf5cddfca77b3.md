:        I wouldn't even refer to him as a libertarian. He's very much
:into family values / universal military training / trade protection
:for United States industries. He falls very close, ideologically,
:alongside the state "militias" out in this part of the country. Those
:groups also profess libertarianism while also advocating extremely
:draconian Christian social programs.

He's also a crook. After his foray into Southeast Asia he went into the
treasure hunting business. He defrauded the widow of a man who had been
hunting for this one treasure. (Forgive me for the sketchy details, this
was on a show on the Discovery channel about 2 years ago. I believe the
show was "The Treasure Hunters." Took her for all of her money "continuing
the hunt" and never really did anything. On second thought he might just
fit in in Washington. He can pal around with Ollie North. They would
probably have a blast at one of Packwoods' or Kennedy's parties.   ;)
