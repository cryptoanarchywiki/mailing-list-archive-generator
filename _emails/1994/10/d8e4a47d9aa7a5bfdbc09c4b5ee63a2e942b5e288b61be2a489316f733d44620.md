PROJECT:  Digital Librarian

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:
The "Digital Librarian" links together the libraries where
information of any type (books, texts, pictures, audio, video,
multi-media, etc.) is stored to the librarians who assist the
users in navigating through these storehouses of knowledge.  This
project brings these ideas to the desktop by allowing a user to
gain access to any number of information sources, independent of
the originating development of the sources.  The information
sources can be anything from databases to online reference
materials to online training materials.  The user interacts with
these sources through one common interface.

In addition, this project enhances textual material searches by
providing a hypertext link capability for a user to navigate a
document in a more meaningful way.  Instead of just paging
through a document one page at a time, the system can bring the
user to the place in the document where the information is
located.  In the future, natural language and artificial
intelligence techniques will be exercised to increase user
efficiency in searching through the library storehouses of
knowledge.

Out of the kindness of it's heart, the NSA is going to build us all a nice,
new, improved WWW!

Isn't that just *too* kind of them?

I wonder why I have this feeling I'd better not turn my back on them.....
