Caught from the radio this morning:

    Toronto (Canada) city council is debating a by-law to ban information
on bomb construction.  This after one of the council members was mailed
a faulty (or fake) pipe-bomb.  Rough quote: ~This is different than the
gun control issue because there is no valid use for bombs.~

I wonder how much of the libraries' engineering books section they'll
have to burn because of this.
