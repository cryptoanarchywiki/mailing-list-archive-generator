   Are you crazy? If you were allowed to opt out of government
standards and eat what you want, you'd be driving up healthcare
costs! That's unfair to your brothers and sisters! The government
will stop you anyway by requiring everyone to have quarterly checkups
and then have the medical records of people with unhealthy lifestyles
sent to them. If you refuse, you won't get to be in the government
healthcare system, which is only fair since you're driving up
everyone else's costs like a sociopath.

p.s. I hate to have to do this, but some people lack a sacasm detector,
so: ;-) ;-) ;-)
