Genetic Engineering, of course, my silico-centric friend :-)

Query:  Why is it that, when the usual stream of crypto-conversation
begins to dry up, the topic of bombs comes up?  Maybe crypto-anarchists
should seek to replace the traditional symbol of anarchy (you know, the
bowling ball with the fuse) with something more moderne.  Any suggestions
on what the well-dressed (black trenchcoat and fedora, for tradition's
sake) crypto-anarchist is seen clutching in his hand as he skulks off into
shadows of Blacknet???  You know, something that would make a good .gif.
