That's part of it, but the more important binding created by a
signature is the binding between the userid and the real person.
Without that binding, the binding between the key and the userid is
useless.  This is why photo-identification (i.e., a passport) a
required part of keysigning (unless the signer personally knows the
key's owner).  Sure signatures bind the userid to the key, but what
good is that to third parties if they can't be sure that the userid
accurately names the person who possesses that key?

When I meet you in person to hand you my key fingerprint, won't you
require me to identify myself in order that you can be sure the name
in the userid of my key is also the name of the person you are
meeting?  If you do, then you will have just validated the binding
between userid and real person.

Which is exactly why I can never sign the key of a pseudonymous
entity.  Because the entity is unwilling to prove to me that there is
a single real person who possesses the private half of his key.

I don't like the idea of an automaton possessing or signing PGP keys.
People sign other people's keys because only people have the need to
trust other people.  Automatons don't need to trust and they are not
the direct targets of trust.  This is the objection I had to Phil's
signing of the Betsi public key.  As an automaton, Betsi is only as
trustable as its human authors and adminstrators.  Yet Phil doesn't
know who those people may be in five or ten years.  Yes, people change
over time too, but not as quickly or as radically as an automaton can.
It's too easy to subvert an automaton for me to ever sign an
automaton's PGP key.
