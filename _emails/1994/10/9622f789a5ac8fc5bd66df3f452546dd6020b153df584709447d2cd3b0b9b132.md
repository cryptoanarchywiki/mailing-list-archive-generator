Some interesting figures recently wafted my way about the sizes of
private asset holdings in the world.  These are Goldman, Sachs
estimates.

4 Trillion (10^12) dollars in total worldwide personal assets
2 Trillion of that is secretly held assets
1.5 Trillion of the secretly held assets are in Switzerland

Mighty interesting numbers indeed.

Eric
