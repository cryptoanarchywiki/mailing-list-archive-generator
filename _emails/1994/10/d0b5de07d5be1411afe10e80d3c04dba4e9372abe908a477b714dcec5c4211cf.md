	I'm taking public speaking so that I can finally get out of
college and into the big wide world, and have decided to educate my
class on the controversy surrounding the Digital Telephony Initiative.
I need hardcopy to make my TA happy, and after an (admittedly quick)
browsing of the archives, I wasn't able to find much in the way of
hard information. Are there any good pointers, especially to the
recent Lehman version of the bill and the controversy that now
surrounds the EFF?

Thanks in advance for your help,
ozymandias G desiderata
