Long article today on widespread international calling-card 
fraud -- stealing and selling numbers to and by computer 
hackers around the world -- and Secret Service and other LEAs 
current traps, investigations, arrests and indictments.

Don't call if you want e-mail copy, they're about to bust you.

This looks like one of "threats" the Wiretap Bill (and maybe 
the newly chastened CIA) hopes to squash.

John
