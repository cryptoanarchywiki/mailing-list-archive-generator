Typical statements of folks who get thier politics from Heinlein novels
and thier understanding of personal interaction from economics 101.

The point being that there is no place for ideological attacks like
this in a 'rational' forum trying to discuss 'real life'. Wait, this
discussion *is* to be considered valid intellectual discourse, right?

Questioning ideas gains much more respect than making snide comments.

Just another socialist,
