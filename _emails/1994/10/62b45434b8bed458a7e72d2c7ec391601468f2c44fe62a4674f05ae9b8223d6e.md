   I remember Chomsky being quoted (I think in a Mother Jones issue)
something to the effect that the opposition to "political correctness"
was not legitimate. Apparently, Chomsky finds at least one kind of
oppression to be not distasteful.
   At a Chomsky lecture that I attended, Chomsky described himself as a
left libertarian. I surmise that he finds that grassroots oppression by
the left to be ok. I realize, of course, that "political correctness"
has great mass media & State support.
                                                   Yours Truly,
                                                   Gary Jeffers
