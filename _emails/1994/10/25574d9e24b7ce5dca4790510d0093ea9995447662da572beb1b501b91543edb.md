I used to read cpunks from the discuss archive before I joined the list.
Are non-MIT folks able to access:

http://www.mit.edu:8008/menelaus.mit.edu/cpunks/

?

You made need to fill in the form at http://www.mit.edu:8008/ with
cpunks and menelaus.mit.edu before this link works.

Cheers,

JWS
