I probably ought to get out of lurk mode here, since my signature can be 
found on the key of one of the more prominent pseudonyms on the list, 
Black Unicorn.  I met Uni briefly at one of the (two) D.C. area 
cypherpunks meetings, last spring.  I didn't check his ID.  For all his 
reluctance to give his name here, he did, as I recall, attempt to give it at 
at the meeting.  (Pat Farrell was trying to draw a seating chart so we'd 
know what to call each other, but he had trouble spelling Uni's 
name.)

I guess it could have been an impostor at the meeting, but enough 
of the details seemed to match up that I didn't have any doubts about 
him.  And I've probably got enough information from his posts, and my 
hazy recollection of his first name, to find out who he is, if I felt 
like it.

I guess my point is that key signing doesn't always fit into one 
particular category, one that requires a drivers license or passport.  
That (or personal knowledge of the person) is the most secure method for 
keys that are clearly bound to a specific person, but it's not the only 
way things are done.
