From: James A. Donald

The intended effect is to make us feel that such "extreme"
freedom of speech is a bit excessive and not really
necessary or desirable.
          . . .
Thus he is actually making a misleading and spurious
argument *against* freedom of speech at the same time as he
is piously declaring himself to be in favor of freedom of
speech.
...............................................................

James, couldn't he simply be taken at his word -  his explicit 
expression, rather than the implied "catty nastiness".  If it was not 
what he really meant, he would eventually be irritated enough by the 
full acceptance of his apparent support for liberty to come out and say 
more precisely what he really wants people to think, so they don't go 
on allowing freedoms which he is really trying to prevent.
