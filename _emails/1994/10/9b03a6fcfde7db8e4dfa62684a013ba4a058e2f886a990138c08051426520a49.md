William Burrows, "Deep Black." About the spy satellite business, thus
covering NRO and such. (A newer name now being seen in "Central
Imagery Office.")

Jeffery Richelson, "U.S. Intelligence Agencies" (or somesuch). Lots of
detail on various agencies. Richelson has also written on non-U.S.
agencies.
