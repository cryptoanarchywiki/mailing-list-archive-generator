This is from the Safe-Tcl list, which discusses a variant on tcl which
provides a "safe" subset of capabilities appropriate for letting incoming
mail bring in programs which can run autonomously on your computer.  I
mentioned this a few weeks ago and I've been on the list, although I haven't
looked at it in much detail.   Nathaniel Borenstein is very active in
the email community so this may turn out to be an influential technology.
He is using PGP to authenticate incoming messages and grant them more
privileges as appropriate:

> multipart, with one of these two types nested inside it somewhere).  The

> the safe-tcl interpreter.  Obviously, if you implement this, you want to
> make sure that you don't usually have PGP_SIGNATURE set in the process
> you use to read your mail! 
> 
> Anyway, to make this work there are two steps: 
> 
> 1.  In your .safetclrc file, add the following: 
> 
> catch { 
>     global SafeTcl_Services 
>     set SafeTcl_Services(authentication) $env(PGP_SIGNATURE) 
> } 
> 
> This will ensure that SafeTcl_Services is set properly if the
> PGP_SIGNATURE variable is set. 
> 
> 2.  Configure your mail reading tool so that it understands
> application/pgp and text/pgp, and sets the PGP_SIGNATURE variable.  For
> metamail-based systems, this consists of adding the following mailcap
> lines: 
> 
> text/pgp; decode-pgp %s ; needsterminal 
> application/pgp; decode-pgp %s  mime; needsterminal; \ 
>     test=test %{format}  = mime 
> application/pgp; decode-pgp %s ; needsterminal 
> 
> and then installing the "decode-pgp" script on your search path.  That
> script is a twelve-line shell script: 
> 
> #!/bin/csh -f 
> set viewprog=cat 
> if ($#argv > 1) then 
>     set viewprog=metamail 
> endif 
> set prog="pgp" 
> set infile=$1 
> pgp $1 -o /tmp/outputfile.$$ |& tee /tmp/shotputfile.$$ 
> set PS=`grep "Good signature" /tmp/shotputfile.$$ | sed -e "s/Good
> signature from user//"` 
> setenv PGP_SIGNATURE "$PS" 
> $viewprog /tmp/outputfile.$$ 
> rm /tmp/*putfile.$$ 
> 
> I think that's all you need to do!  If I'd known it was going to be this
> simple I would have done it months ago!  
> 
> As an example of how to USE this facility, you can put the following
> code in your .safetclrc: 
> 
> proc readsharedfile {nm} { 
>     set fd [open $nm r] 
>     set result [read $fd] 
>     close $fd 
>     return $result 
> } 
> catch { 
>   if {[regexp "nsb@nsb.fv.com" $SafeTcl_Services(authentication)]} { 
>       declareharmless readsharedfile 
>   } 
> } 
> 
> In this case, if you get a safe-tcl program that is signed (and,
> optionally, encrypted) by ME, and I'm on your keyring, it will be able
> to read any file YOU can read.  Otherwise, the readsahredfile procedure
> will be undefined in the restricted interpreter. 
> 
> Pretty cool, eh?  I encourage folks to try it out.  -- Nathaniel 
> 
> PS -- Assuming no problems turn up, I will probably put "decode-pgp" and
> the relevant mailcap entries in the next metamail release, and will
> build the few lines that set SafeTcl_Services based on PGP_SIGNATURE
> into the stuff done automatically in the next safe-tcl release.  --
