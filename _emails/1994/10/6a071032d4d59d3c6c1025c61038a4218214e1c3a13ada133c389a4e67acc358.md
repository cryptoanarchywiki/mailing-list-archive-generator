Yes, I can.  In fact, I am patching 2.6.1 up to 2.6.2 as I write this
letter.  There _will_ be a 2.6.2 release, although I cannot confirm
the date it will be released.  Most likely, it will not be released
for at least a week, possibly longer than that, depending on testing
results.  Official notice will be sent out when the release occurs.

Actually, the code will still not _generate_ 2048-bit keys, but it
will accept them properly.  In the near future PGP will most likely
generate keys that size.

The official PGP FAQ, Buglist, Improvements is on the Web:
	http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/warlord/pgp-faq.html

This gets updated whenever I receive new bug reports and/or
improvements to PGP.  Be warned: this URL is subject to change without
notice.

Hope this answers your questions.
