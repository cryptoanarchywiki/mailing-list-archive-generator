I see no reason why you or anyone else in this thread should apologize
(hence, you _should_ apologize for your inappropriate apology!).

Discussing whether attacks on the leading spokesbimbo for Clipper (er,

us to discuss than a _lot_ of what we talk about. Recent threads on
Chomsky and habanero peppers are just the most recent examples.
