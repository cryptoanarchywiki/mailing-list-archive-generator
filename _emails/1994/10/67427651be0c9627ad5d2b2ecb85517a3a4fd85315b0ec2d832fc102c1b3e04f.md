There's a guy who was active with the National Committee Against Repressive Legislation (Roy Wilkinson?  Memory fades...) who amassed more FBI file pages than anyone.  His file was in excess of 200K pages.  In the files---this I heard directly from him---was information that the FBI had learned of a plot to kill him.  They did nothing but continue their surveillance.
