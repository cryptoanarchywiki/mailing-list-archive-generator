According to EFF staffer Jonah Seiger:

The bill is expected to be voted on in both the House and Senate TODAY! 
The House is expected to vote at about 7:00 pm (ET) and the Senate shortly
there after (although it is still possible that they may not vote until
tomorrow).  The bill IS expected to pass both bodies.

Do what you think is best.
