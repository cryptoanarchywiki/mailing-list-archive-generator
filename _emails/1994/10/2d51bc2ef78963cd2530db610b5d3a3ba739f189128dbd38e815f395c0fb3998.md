My favorite old curmudgeon, Jeff Cooper, has some interesting things
to say in the 27 Sep issue of "Cooper's Commentaries," (cf. rec.guns).


"The subjection to which the American citizen is now exposed every day
of his life is so great that the whole idea of liberty ("That which
does not injure one's neighbor") is almost totally lost. The greatest
of despots, Louis XIV, never told his subjects what they could or
could not eat and drink, and he never told them how to conduct their
private lives."


I won't even try to add more to what he has said.
