Congratulations! You've just described the Blum-GoldWasser Efficient 
Probabilistic Public-Key Encryption Scheme, first outlined in Crypto 84.
Nice description in Schneier, who says it's much faster and more secure
than any other PK scheme, but can obviously only be used one-way as it's
vulnerable to a chosen plaintext attack. It would be possible to cook up 
a protocol to allow for signatures as well, but it'd be tricky.

But we don't know whether it's covered by any Blum-Goldwasser patent... or
the PKP ones.
