The NY Times today has long Peter Lewis article on computer 
snooping at military sites.  It makes an interesting 
counterpoint to the NY Times article today on Clipper's 
ostensible travails.

Many klaxons tooted about lack of security on Internet:

Quote:  This is the place where the first information Chernobyl 
will happen.

Quote:  . . . raised the specter of information assassins, 
highly skilled programmers who work for foreign governments, 
rival corporations or organized crime, who exploit computer 
security weaknesses to manipulate the stock market, hide 
drug-money transactions, or destroy the data bases of financial 
instiutions.

Quote:  There are people coming onto the net who don't have the 
same high ideals and goals, and who are willing to abuse the 
rights of others.  I have likened it to selling swamp land in 
Florida for vacation homes.

And more on how lack of security relates to national encryption 
policy and issues.
