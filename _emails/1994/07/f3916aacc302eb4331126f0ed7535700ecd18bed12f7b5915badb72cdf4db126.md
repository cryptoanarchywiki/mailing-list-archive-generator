In the middle 70s, after Tymnet went international, I would occasionally
send a megabyte to our Paris computer in a proprietary compression format.
I do not believe that NSA spent the time to decode our format, although it
would been relatively easy for them to do so. I can only conclude that they
did not then have blanket surveillance in place, else they would have
contacted me. Both their capacity and international traffic have increased
many times. I suspect that I could do the same now.
