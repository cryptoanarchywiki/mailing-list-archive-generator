  When was AI proved NP? AFAIK, definitions of intelligence
and consciousness aren't even generally agreed on. Consciousness
especially.  Any citations on this claim? The only place I've
heard this before was your claim on the Extropians list last year that
AI required solving NP problems (and that a good answer would not
work), therefore classical computers couldn't do it, but quantum
computers could, and therefore the mind is based on quantum mechanics
and AI won't work.
