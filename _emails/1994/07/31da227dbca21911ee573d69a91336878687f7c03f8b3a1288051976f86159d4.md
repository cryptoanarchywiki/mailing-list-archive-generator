Connie was being silly and bitchy.

If Bezerk had launched an attack on women she would have
been entitled to be offended, and could have answered him
instead of demanding that he be silent.

He did not attack women.

He said that he enjoyed the films representation of woman
as dumb incompetent sex bimbos.

Connie was offended that he should enjoy such a thing.

Tough shit Connie.  Lots of people enjoy stuff I don't like either.

You could complain that the film is false - but then you would look
like an even bigger idiot because the film makes not the slightest
pretence of being realistic.
