True.  This is a big problem that can't be addresses through credit cards,
 due to per-transactions costs.  However, one could cache transactions,
 perhaps even through a central agent, until the amounts were great enough
 (say, $5) to use the mechanism.

Not true.  Teleflora is a company that sells automatic processing software
 and also will be a front-end to credit card companies.  You pay 'em, you
 get your merchant ID and go, and start getting checks every so often.

Additionally, more and more agents are appearing out there who are perfectly
 willing to serve as intermediaries.  Bibliobytes, for example, is soon
 going to expand its services to offer not just books but any software that
 people wish to sell (once we have our processing fully automated and the
 bugs cleared out -- books are just a boot-strap mechanism).

I see a lot of great ideas for e$ out there, but I think they all suffer
 from a central fault: there's no easy transition from the way people do
 business in the real world to an e$ model.  IMO, you've got to base a system
 in the way people are used to working and make a gentle transition, or
 it's simply going to fail purely on the learning curve.
