Ah, the exact question for us to be asking! "Why add SKE at all when
no one's asking for it?" Indeed.

Why the upcoming conference on key escrow? Why the representatives
from Germany, Netherlands, France, etc.?

Where is the public debate about these things? (I'm not claiming, by
the way, that corporations have to debate with the public before
developing features--I'm a free market sort. But it's clear that more
than just isolated product developments are involved. The extent of
collusion between vendors and goverments is unclear, but signs point
to such collusion.)

We may be able to rally enough opposition this time around to make
work on SKE an "unsocial" thing to do (Recall our strategy of making
Clipper vendors corporate outcasts, with our "Big Brother Inside"
approach?).
