The NSA algorithm involved didn't use keywords. It was way more powerfull 
than that, able to sort text samples into arbitrary catagories based on 
examples of text that you give it. It doesn't use any keywords or grammer 
recognition, it doesn't even matter what language you feed it.

They refused to give me a copy, they are trying to make a buck by 
licensing it commercialy. I tried to ask about what it costs to get a 
license, and they asked what company I was representing, and I told them 
I was representing myself, and they stonewalled me. Looks like they don't 
think I have the money they want. (they're probably right about that btw...)

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
