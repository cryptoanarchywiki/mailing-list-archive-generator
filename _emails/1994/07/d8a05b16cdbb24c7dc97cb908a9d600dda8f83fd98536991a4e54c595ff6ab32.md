I'll look into this...

Basically I cut this code out of WNSTORM where it works correctly.  Since I
wrote this very quickly, you can tell I did minimal debugging on it...

argv[2][0] should be '-'
argv[2][1] should be 'R'
argv[2][2] should be 'F' 
argv[2][3] should be ':'
argv[2][4]... should be the random file.

Try it without the '-' infront of RF: and see if it makes a difference.

Meanwhile I'll check this out...
