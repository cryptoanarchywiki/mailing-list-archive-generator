The error in Tim's analogy between his income tax example standard 
privacy techniques is that the techniques have already passed the test of 
time.  They aren't theoretical; people have used them for years.  Tim's 
claim that "this is much easier said than actually done" only indicates 
that Tim either has never tried to do it, or did it poorly.  I've seen it 
done--year in and year out.  It's real, folks.

Over the period I've been on this list, I've seen the  optimism of 
various Cypherpunks wax and wane.  Normally, I greatly respect Tim's 
opinions.  Today, though, I think Tim is reflecting an emotional response 
more than a factual one.

I, and I'm sure Duncan, would be more than happy to discuss the subject 
with anyone on the list who is interested.  Let's do it offline, though, 
unless there is a strong crypto tie-in.
