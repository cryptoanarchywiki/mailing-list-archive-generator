Mike Ingle sent out an inquiry in May about public-key encryption in 
WinFax 4.0 in Microsoft at Work.  This is the reply which I received 
from someone here:

We don't use D-H (Diffie Hellman is what I assume you were referring 
to) at all.
We pick a 64 bit random number to RC4 with and send the number 
encrypted with an RSA key...

I have made an inquiry specifically about WfW 3.11, but it may be a few 
days before I get a reply.
