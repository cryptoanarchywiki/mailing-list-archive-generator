Actually I sent it because I thought the members of this list might be
interested in seeing how they are "presented" in a mainstream tech journal.
Also I was curious to see if members agreed with the statement of the one
member basically speaking for the list, as well as the total lack of reference
to PGP in the article.  Was I off base in my thoughts about the potential
interest in this article?  If so, apologies.
