Good one-way transformations are hard to find.
Merkle & Hellman's knapsack-based cryptosystem predated RSA;
it depended on transforming an easy subproblem of a NP-hard general problem
into the general case.  Shamir and others found ways to reverse the
transformation that was used, reducing it to the easy problem.
In general, a symmetric cryptosystem needs to have one easy path through it
(using the key); an asymmetric system needs two (encryption & decryption),
and that's much harder to find.  The inter-relatedness of NP-complete
problems probably doesn't help much.  

There may be some deep mathematical truth hiding somewhere in here,
but I'm more of an applied-math type than a real theoretician :-)

A separate problem is that signature and encryption are both useful,
and it's hard to find a system that can do both securely.

Lately they've been more like speed limits...
