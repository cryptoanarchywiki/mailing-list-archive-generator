     _Essentially_, you have a random string of text. Mind you, it's not
statistically, nor cryptographically, random, but it's something that no
PERSON would guess. If you are trying to get something to keep PEOPLE out,
you've picked a nice one. If, OTOH, you're trying to get something to keep
HACKERS/MACHINES out, you've got a somewhat time consuming one. Does that
answer your question? :-)
