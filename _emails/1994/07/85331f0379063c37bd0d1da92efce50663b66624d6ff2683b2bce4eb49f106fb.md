What about Shamir's triple pass key exchange protocol (explained briefly
below). Its the perfect key exchange algorithm. It obsoletes Public key
systems entirely as long as you only need to exchange keys and not
authenticate. I'd say that is pretty decent evidence that he does still
do things to help the field when it might hurt RSADSI. (although I wouldn't
say the same thing about all of them)

Triple pass key exchange:

Choose a commutative symetric encryption algorithm.

Step 1: A encrypts the session key in his personal symetric key (he doesn't
        share it with anybody) and sends the message to B: Ea(K)
Step 2: B encrypts this in her personal symetric key and sends it back
        to A: Eb(Ea(K))
Step 3: A decrypts the message and sends it back to B: Da(Eb(Ea(K)))
        Since we chose a commutative algorithm, this is Eb(K).
Step 4: B decrypts with her key and Eve (ala Scheier) has no clue. Mallet
        can't intercept your communication, but he can talk to you and
        unless you have some sort of authentication impersonate Eve.

Example commutative algorithm out of Schneier by Shamir based on the
hardness of factoring:

Choose a large prime, p. Choose an encryption key e that is a large prime
less than p. Choose a d so that d*e mod (p-1) = 1 (i.e. the muliplicative
inverse of e in mod (p-1)).

C = P^e mod p
P = C^d mod p
