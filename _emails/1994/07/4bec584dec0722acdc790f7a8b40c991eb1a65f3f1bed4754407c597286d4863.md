Hi, 

 I got a question from a Polish PGS user who wants to know wheter he
 can make a commercial version of PGP for Europaen users.

 He mentioned the Swiss patent holding of IDEA, but he wasn't able to 
 contact the people over there as the fax/phone numbers were disconnected. :-|

 Does anyone with a bit legal knowledge know anything about this?
 i.e. does he have to obtain licenses from RSA (although he only plans to
 export in Europe) and from the patent holders of RSA.

 And how about Phil ? Does Philip Zimmermann allow this kind of usage of his
 code ?
