I've been off the list for a bit, so I can only guess this relates
to a discussion of the latest CRAM spam.  Detweiler watchers, train
your sights on "nym@netcom.com (Sue D. Nym)", who fairly recently
showed up on Usenet sporting all the usual stigmata.

My take on the Singularity is that it will commence when the
Detweiler cycle devolves to zero length, so that he simultaneously
is obtaining and being booted from accounts on all service providers.
Pretty incomprehensible, eh?
