I'm also tired of them, and I don't spam folks who are liberals or
leftists. I've generally found that people's political views are
formed when they are of college age, and rarely change significantly
after that. Not sure why this is so, but I think it is.

Just to be clear about this, in no way, shape or form am I just
"waiting for governments to collapse."

I'll make the charitable assumption that "I prefer doing something with
the tools at hand to dreaming" is not an insinuation that we
libertarians or crypto anarchists are idle dreamers.
