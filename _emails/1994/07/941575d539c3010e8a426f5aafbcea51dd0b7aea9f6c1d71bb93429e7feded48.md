I was compiling a list of crypto algorithms the other night, trying to
produce a library of description documents for the algorithms, and an
interesting but idle question hit me: what ever happened to RC1, RC3,
MD1, MD3, A1, A2, A4, A6, and A7?

Just wondering if anyone knows...

							Ian.
