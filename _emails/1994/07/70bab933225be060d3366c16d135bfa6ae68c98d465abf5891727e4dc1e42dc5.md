A good beginning to changing it.

I like your original notion of card-playing as a way to build a 
taste for crypto by non-cryptoids (like me).

It parallels political and economic chance and the use of 
crypto to hide info from foes and competitors.

Putting crypto into public play like this will help teach 
protection from economic security mongers and toadies.

Your idea shows that c'punks chefs continue to cook tastier 
fare than the alt. and talk. fora elsewhere.  

It feeds my interest in c'punks: the peripheral discussions, 
sometimes crypto-related,  enhance the main dish.
