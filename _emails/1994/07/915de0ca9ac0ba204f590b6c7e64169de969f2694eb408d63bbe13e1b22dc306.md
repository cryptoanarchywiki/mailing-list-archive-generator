Or for the rabid, clinically paranoid:

3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 
3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 
3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 
3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 
3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 
3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 
3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 
3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 
3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 
3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 
3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 
3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 
... about 500 more lines of the same ...

with a memorized 5 megabyte key.

And I thought 15 round Diamond with a 256 bit key was overkill worse than 
3 key triple DES!

Seriously, folks, the weakest links of most cryptosystems are not in the 
symmetric key cipher (provided you pick one of the good ones), but in the 
key management, associating people with keys, and in picking good pass 
phrases.

Peace to you.
