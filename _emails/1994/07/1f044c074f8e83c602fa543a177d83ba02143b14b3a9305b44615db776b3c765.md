Hi All,

Several of my more politicaly active friends are interested in starting a 
lobby group (if feasible) in the ctl. Texas area on this issue. I wandered
all over WWW, gopher, etc. last evening trying to find the specific bill
which covers this. I found *lots* of references to comprehensive plastic
data-cards and smart cards. 

I would appreciate some kind sould e-mailing me the bill name which has
this in it. 

Take care.
