Not quite; the last name would at least be the foundation of the
key--otherwise, just use the first field to decrypt the second. Location is
either 132 or 160 bytes from the start of the hash; all else is obscurity
that wouldn't be all that effective. Remeber, anybody can do individual
lookups, or else I'd just use some secure method to get it into people's
hands. If you can do individual lookups, you can do a lot (all) of them;
the best I can hope for is to slow that down, preferably in a
cryptographically secure way.

All it takes is some ambitious employee with connections to somebody with a
medium-sized workstation with a fair amount of idle time, like overnight. A
cheapie Alpha would do very nicely. Let it work--at no cost other than
initial setup and electricity--for a month or three, and you've got an
awful lot of names, even if you don't have the whole database.

There's not much obscurity here. Just write a minimal wrapper to the
existing (supplied) decryption code, unless my "security" relies on
non-cryptographic stalling, like counting to a million before doing
anything. I sure don't want to rely on that.

And a company such as Microsoft wouldn't even notice the effort. Think
about it: a database of musicians (the group I'm doing this for is the Phi
Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the men's professional fraternity in music) known to be
technically inclined--after all, their database is cryptographically
protected. Who better to target for their musical instrument CD?

If any TLA wants the unencrypted database, they can have it from me for the
price of a warrant--and that's just to be sure that they're not imposters.
Our membership rolls are alerady public.

Nice idea. If there is demand for a program such as this after I've written
the basic version for Sinfonia, I'll code that, as well.

Well, by that definition, DES is a group....

Any chance you (or anybody else) can point me in the direction of sources
that would state this definitively? I'd much rather do multiple hashes than
use some sort of kludge with multiple DES encryptions, but I won't unless I
can find something in the literature. "A job worth doing...."

Thanks for your help.
