Since I consider myself new to this whole topic, even though I have read 
several articles about PGP and CLIPPER, I wanted to get some more info 
and understanding for my senior seminar next May....  

Does anyone have any opinions on what would happen if the Clipper Chip 
and its associates were all implemented and the general public swallowed 
on it?? Would we as knowledgeable computer people become outlaws??? Would 
be it like 1984?? Would our computer illiterate neighbors try and catch 
us??? 

And going the complete opposite direction (a full 180). If the public was 
able to obtain PGP as easily as we are and they would use it for 
everything, would that lead to the overthrowing of the government and 
therefore cause anarchy, due to the fact the governmnet would be helpless 
in knowing what everyone is doing contrary to the CIA, FBI, etc. being 
able to read everything we write and say through their current illegal 
wiretaps???
 
I'm just looking to get a complete picture. At this moment I would go 
with PGP, but I still see a lot of problems with being on either side. 
They seem so extreme...
