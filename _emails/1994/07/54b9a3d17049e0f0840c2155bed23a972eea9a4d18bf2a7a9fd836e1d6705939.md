   Congratulations!  I consider the "Clipper Chip retreat" a victory for the 
Cypherpunks, EFF, and inhabitants of cyberspace.  We have succeeded in a 
tactic often used by three letter agencies... Stall!  The "stall" tactic 
lets you re-supply, regroup and plan the next attack .

   This event slows the government down and will provide the inhabitants of 
cyberspace more time to develop a defacto encryption system (PGP, RIPEM, 
PEM, etc) that will overshadow any scheme deployed by government.  It also 
gives us time to continue the fight against "Key-escrow" and government back 
doors.

This message may be a little premature but if true, we should be ready for 
the next offensive.  (yes offensive).  This bit of information also makes me 
wander what their next move might be.  It could be... "NEWS FLASH... Drug 
lord goes free because he is using non-key-escrow crypto..."
