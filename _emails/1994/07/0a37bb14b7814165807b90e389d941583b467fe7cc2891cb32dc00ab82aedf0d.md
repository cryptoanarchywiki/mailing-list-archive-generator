PGP 2.7 from viacrypt is now shipping.  The main reason for the upgrade (in 
my opinion) is compatibility with 2.6.  They did add some extra stuff 
though.

   They are also working on a Windows version to be ready this summer 
(according to their letter) and I am using their WinCim/CSNav version at 
home when I use CI$.

   I asked the same thing of Viacrypt.  I lost the reply but it essentially 
said that they are working on a DLL toolkit to make it easy to integrate PGP 
into other Windows applications and are looking at MS Mail among others.
