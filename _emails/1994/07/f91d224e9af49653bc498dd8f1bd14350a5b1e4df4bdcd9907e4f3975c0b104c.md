Hey guys, I've just sent up the PC Expo disk package to ftp.wimsey.bc.ca
incase anyone is interested in it.  Give it some time as Mark has to clear it
but it's in the incoming folder right now...

I'll try to send it up to some other sites, but I guess I won't send it to
csua.berkeley.edu as it isn't being taken care of... (if you know otherwise
let me know and I'll send it there too...)




{% endraw %}
