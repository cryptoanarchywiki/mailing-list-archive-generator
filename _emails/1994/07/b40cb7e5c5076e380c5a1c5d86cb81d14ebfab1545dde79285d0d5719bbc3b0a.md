Another approach to getting enough entropy in passwords/phrases is a
"visual key" where one mouses from position to position in a visual
environment. That is, one is presented with a scene containg some
number of nodes, perhaps representing familiar objects from one's own
home, and a path is chosen.

The advantage is that most people can remember fairly complicated
(read: high entropy) "stories." Each object triggers a memory of the
next object to visit. (Example: door to kitchen to blender to
refrigerator to ..... ) This is the visual memory system said to be
favored by Greek epic poets.

This also gets around the keyboard-monitoring trick (but not
necessarily the CRT-reading trick, of course).

I haven't used one of these schemes, but I recall hearing that at
least one commercial product offers this as an option.

It might be an interesting hack to offer this as a front end for PGP.

Even a simple grid of characters which could be moused on could be an
assist in using long passphrases.

(But someone has probably patented this approach.)

P.S. I'm not hung up on passphrases as a major weakness. I think theft
of keys and keystroke capturing on compromised machines are much
more important practical weaknesses.
