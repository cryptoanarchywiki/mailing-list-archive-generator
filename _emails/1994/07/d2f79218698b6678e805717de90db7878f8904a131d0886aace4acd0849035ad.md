Cypherpunks,

Earlier, somebody (I beleive Carl Ellison, but I screwed up and
deleted the file) asked about AOL and the gopher site.

The problem may not be AOL or CPSR actually.

What happened is this: Chael reorganized the gopher site, placing the
Cypherpunks Gopher Archive into a subdirectory.  So the archive is
still at chaos.bsu.edu, but no longer immediately at the top level.
Perhaps CPSR's pointer to the site is no longer valid!

Or maybe the problem is that he also upgraded to a new gopher server,
which is supposed to be backwards compatible ;) and one of these days
I'll create some sort of index files (?) to take advantage of the new
features, etc.  So maybe this is the problem, a new version that AOL
doesn't handle.

So try gopher'ing directly to chaos.bsu.edu and then into the
"Cypherpunks Gopher Archive" if going through somebody else isn't
working.

Hm... I'll inform CPSR about the change.
