. . .  . . Bill Gates is attempting to create a worldwide network
of about a hundred satellites.  You don't get to do that without
political assistance, and no way is the USG going to let Bill put those
birds up unless they control the technology to snoop on the entire net.
...............................................................

Could Bill even think about setting up a satellite network without 
confronting the Governmental Presence?  Anyone who plans to do anything 
in communications must come to terms with the Divine Intervention 
Department;  maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but for sure by payday.
Can anyone in the United States get away with introducing a product or 
service which is not going to require that "government interests" be 
represented in some way (if only at tax-time)?

They must, at the very least, have meetings, conferences, discussions 
to ensure that 1) no one in the world is going to be damaged by the new 
service, and 2) that the MotherShip will get its revenue % .   Is there 
any legally-sanctioned enterprise/company which can avoid this?

This is a real predicament not limited to Billg and his interest in the 
internet.  I think quite broadly about all of the areas in which the 
government steps in to maintain a controlling influence;  any time a 
new idea is introduced, They Will Be There to make sure that they can 
protect us from the new-fangled object in case anyone tries to use it 
against us, the Precious Ones, the Most Valuable Citizens of the World.

Scanaphobia, anyone?

Yeah and since when has this country been so easy to quit and find a new 
job with the same relative pay???? Do you think it's that easy??? Uh I 
don't think so.. duh huh... I can't even get a summer job working at a 
computer store and I'm very computer literate for my age.
