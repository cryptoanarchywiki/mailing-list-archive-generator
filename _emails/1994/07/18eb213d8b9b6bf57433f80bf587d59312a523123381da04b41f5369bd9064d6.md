The article implied that in exchange for this, the Cantwell amendment had
been scrapped. This was far more important, IMHO. The government never had
a chance to impose that silly chip. But threatening prison to people who
export crypto is extremelly painful to people trying to build businesses
based on things that use cryptography.

Has the government ever actually prosecuted somebody for exporting crypto
source code via the net? It seems like an interesting test case, and based
on the ruling about exporting applied cryptography, I would say that it was
permitted. (After all, our right to free speach involves the transmission
of ideas. I can understand them stopping the export of physical things
like computer disks, but not source code).

So does anybody actually know of a case in which the government attempted
to jail somebody for knowingly transmitting cryptographic programs from the
US?
