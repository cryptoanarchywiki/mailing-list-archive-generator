	The issue is not one of copyrights as much as of reputation.  If
	people believe that prz is a lousy security consultant as a result
	of irresponsible hacks made on PGP then his reputation has been
	damaged and therefore he is entitled to restitution.  

	Note:  I'm not implying that Tom's hacks are irresponsible since 
		   I've not seen them.  Simply that if they are then prz has
		   right to 'make a case'
