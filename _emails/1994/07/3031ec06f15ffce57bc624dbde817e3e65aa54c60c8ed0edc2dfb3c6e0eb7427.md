     We use this for accessing our Ameritech database.  What I recall 
overhearing when they were training the CENTREX people on the smart cards 
was that it looks at how far off the numbers are over a period of time 
and determines how much faster or slower your card is, then figures that 
into its calculations when you call.  So after, say, twenty sessions over 
a two-week period, it knows not to accept the code from two minutes ago.
