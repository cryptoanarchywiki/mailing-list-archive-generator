     Your basic idea is excellent, so excellent in fact that you could
probably make some money by providing the service.  As a parent of a
soon-to-be netsurfer, I would be willing to pay more for an account
that gave me some control over my daughter's access than I would for a
standard netcom style account.  Let me know when such accounts are
available.

     In the meantime, there is no need for force.  The immediate
reaction of "there ought to be a law" is a direct contradiction to the
net "policing itself".

Regards,
