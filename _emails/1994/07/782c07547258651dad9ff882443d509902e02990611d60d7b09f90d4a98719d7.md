     I've heard of incidents where a group of people dressed in white
sheets hung other people with dark skin.  Not one of those
white-sheeted people snitched, in many cases.

     If you were limiting your assertion to crime over the net, I
suggest that the long, interesting history of confidence men is a
refutation.  Done correctly, in many cases the victim doesn't even
know he has been conned.
