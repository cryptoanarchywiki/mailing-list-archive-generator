The only method I have heard (and this is merely hard to break) is to put
the hash value in a dongle. Then everyone will hate your program.

Another method that could provide interesting results is to throw
code in that will cause the program to function *differently* if
hacked. I'm thinking of (I think- correcttions wecome) AutoCad,
which was dongled and hacked, but the hack caused some math funciton
or another to return erroneous results. This is just obfusification,
but could give a hacker some major headaches.
