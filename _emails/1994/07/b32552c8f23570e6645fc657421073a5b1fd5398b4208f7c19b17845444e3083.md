Questions:

1) In non-mathematical terms, if possible, what difference does this
   make in terms of security?

2) Does anyone know why is this undocumented?

3) What changes did you make? Sounds like it would be a well-received
   set of patches to be made public.


(I'm well aware of the current arguments regarding algorithmic strength
being no substitute for secure key management; I'm merely curious.)
