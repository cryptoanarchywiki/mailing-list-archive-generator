	 Figure that each English character has 1.8 bits of entropy.
	 (This is a conservative number, because it doesn't take into
	 account case, spacing, or punctuation.)  If I want a
	 passphrase that will map into a 64-bit keyspace, I need at
	 least a 35-chararcter phrase.

Don't forget the difficulty of typing such a long phrase, with
echoing turned off.
