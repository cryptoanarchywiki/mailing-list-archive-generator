This will certainly put a nice toad up the NSA's ass.   Anyone reading this
will see that the cypherpunks are a bunch of folk that stick together as a
single entity whose purpose right now is to kill clipper.  (Right and if they
do, have I got a great bridge to sell them!)

Seriously though, I don't want this transcript to be butchered and quoted
from in some assinine magazine and have it pointed to as the reason we need
clipper.  At least with a copyright on its ass, it gets a bit harder to play
games.

Will certainly do that. :-)  As a disk image.  But as I said, I have to fix
that bug first.  Also, look forward to seeing a few articles from your
column. :-)  Thanx for letting me use'em.
