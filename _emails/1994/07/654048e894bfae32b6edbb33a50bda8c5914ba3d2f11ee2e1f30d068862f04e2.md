Michael Wilson writes about the NSA's wafer fab facility, which I
think Tim has addressed in some detail. He then goes on to say:

I don't agree. If you know that NRO, for example, is using
Intergraph's Interact photogrammetry workstations (disclaimer: I don't
know if they are or not) that will indeed tell you give you a floor
value for the capability of their analyses, but only because the
Interact is an off-the-shelf unit. Add in custom software- as the NSA
is certain to have done- and your floor value is only that. In the
case of photointerp, I suggest that knowing how many pixels a NeXT box
can display is not particularly useful in building an attack strategy.

In general, I don't think that knowledge of hardware capabilities is
too valuable. We had a similar discussion w.r.t. key lengths recently;
I think the consensus was that knowing how many large supercomputers
NSA had didn't mean that you could accurately estimate their factoring
abilities, since it is likely that any advances they've made would be
concealed. Again, you end up with the floor value.
