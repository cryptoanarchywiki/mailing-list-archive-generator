Whoops. Of course that wouldn't work. If a delay was imposed after any
registration before processing any next one, then there's an obvious denial
of service attack by simply sending in lots of registrations. And if there
isn't, someone can simply register a zillion different e-mail addresses and
public keys and send each copy of a mail bomb from a different one. Someone
who wants to build up a reputation can already do it anonymously (like
Pr0duct Cypher), while someone who wants to make trouble doesn't need to
build up a reputation. Oh well.
