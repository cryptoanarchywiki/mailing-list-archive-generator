DigiCash update:

We plan to start an ecash trial on the Internet this summer. If you
are interested in participating in the trial, please contact us at
ecash-beta@digicash.support.nl, and include in your message whether
you want to 'buy' services on the net or whether you want to 'sell'
services (this will only be possible in the second phase of the
trial). Please note that some of the information on the Web server is
currently data protected and will become available to the people
participating in the trial.

If you don't want to participate in the trial, but do want to be kept
informed of the latest developments, and haven't already done so,
please let us know more about the nature of your interest, and at
least which of the following categories fits best:

   (a) potential acceptor of electronic cash for services offered
       over the network, 

   (b) potential provider of electronic cash service itself to other
       network service providers, 

   (c) member of the press, or

   (d) interested in the technology for other purposes.

Very kind regards,


David Chaum
Managing Director
