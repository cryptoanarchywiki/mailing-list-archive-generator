Today's broadcast of "The McClaughlin(sp?) Group" had a short segment  
discussing the likelihood that terrorists will get and detonate a nuclear  
device.  The opinions of the five journalists varied from "not likely" to  
"almost certain".  At the end of the show, when the journalists are asked  
to make their predictions, one of them said that due to the terrorist  
threat, the US needs a larger and more powerful intelligence capability  
that ever before.
