I agree. The environmental fascists on the 'left' and the "don't you
deviate from the mainstream" masses in the 'middle' are no better. I
believe that children are best exposed to everything out there at an early

I am not sure if explaining this under my own name would be wise at this
point in time. Perhaps someone else would like to elaborate through a
remailer?
