I have a writing assignment coming up (nothing to do
with much that is talked about on this list), and some
example posts by Detweiler could be really handy as
references. I have one from a long time ago, but could
use some others- anybody save any for posterity? If so,
could you forward me a couple of juicy ones?

thanks-
