C'Punks,
     I'm looking for a list of Anon Remailers that hopefully have most/all
of the following features, or at least get me in the ballpark. Failing
that, perhaps just a list of remailers would be nice. Requested features:

     o    I would like to be able to send a PGP [2.3-present versions!]
          file with commands-etc to be decoded and processed by the Anon
          Remailer. This allows me to not have to send my password-etc in
          plaintext. I realize that this will have to wait until after my
          first email to the remailer, as it has to get my key.

     o    Allows embedded PGP files: One for the remailer, which contains
          both a second PGP message and commands for the remailer.

     o    Allows passwording of anon accounts (I know, they probably all
          do this....)

     o    Reports back errors in command syntax-etc, using a pgp encrypted
          file.

     o    Uses latency and/or reordering.

     o    Relatively quick (this might countermand latency -- I'm not sure
          which is more important to me)


     I'm just getting started with remailers, and am interested in secure,
anonymous communications.

                                        --Jeff
