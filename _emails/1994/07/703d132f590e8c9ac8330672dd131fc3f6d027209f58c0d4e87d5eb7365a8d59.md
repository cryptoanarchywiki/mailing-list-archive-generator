Is there a problem with the remailer at soda.berkeley.edu?
Or are they simply moving machines around, as the message
indicates? I received this "warning" message -

The Computer Science Division at the University of California at
Berkeley is in the process of moving into a brand new building.
This entails moving all machines.  If you are getting a warning
message that the individual's machine is not responding, you might
want to try to contact them using something other than e-mail.

That's the easiest part. International competition for the precious
few organizations requiring launching facilities has almost entirely
elimintated government intervention in what goes up. Its just like
dealing with regulations made by physical world entities in cyberspace.
If you don't like the rules, it is easy to move it elsewhere.

All we need is widely distributed software with optional escrow and the
government will be helpless against us. They won't have a prayer of passing
legislation that prevents you from using your software, so they'll pass
legislation that requires you to use escrows. People will register a key with
the escrow and then use a different key for everything. Escrow dies. Of
course we should fight anything mandating escrow, but the reality is that
if we can force the escrow into software it will be useless to big brother.
