Any word from Apple? Given their past relationship with RSA (built in to
PowerTalk) and without the threat of an antitrust suit, are they going to
sell out as well?

(I define sell-out to mean unavoidable key escrow built-in to the operating
system--the gov will eventually require that they get a copy in this case,
as others have mentioned)

Tim, it looks like it may not take 6 months after all. When is the Hard
core privacy seminar, anyway?
