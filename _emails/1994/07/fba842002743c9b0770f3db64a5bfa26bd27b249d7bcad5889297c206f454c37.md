 There is a great article in the August (2.08) Wired on Satellite
Pirates, we are mentioned as well as PGP...

Exerpt from wired issue 2.08 August " Satellite Pirates"

Lesson Number Four: Encryption protects little guys better then big
guys. When a scrambled TV signal is sent to millions of decoder
modules, that signal becomes easy pickings. When two individuals
exchange a brief encrypted message, that message is relativly
secure. Video pirates have started test running PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy, the "peoples encryption software") to protect private
messages that they exchange via their bulletin boards. This doesn't
just put the pirates on equal terms with the programmers, it gives
them an edge. Cypherpunks have promoted PGP as protection from a
potential state, while the Clinton administration sees it as more
of a threat to law and order. Evidently, both sides are correct,
but there no point in arguing about it anymore. The genie is out of
the bottle.


 This article is highly recommended! The two principles in the
story operate out of the Bahamas, they distribute the "magic codes"
through a nationwide series of BBS's. The "Chipped" decoders are
set to dial there local BBS!


reaching for my eyepatch and a bottle of rum!
