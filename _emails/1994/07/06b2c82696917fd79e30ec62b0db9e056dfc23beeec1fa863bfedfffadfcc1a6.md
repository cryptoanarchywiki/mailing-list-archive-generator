Heinlein said it was time to move when some place instituted mandatory IDs.
This month's Money mag has an article on the increase in expatriation by
native-born US citizens as well as increasing interest in same.

Some places are more bureaucratic than here and some are less.  The best
place to move to in "nowhere".  That is, don't spend too much time in any
one country.  Local rules bite less on those who are just passing through.

Slick Willy will need congressional action on a mandatory ID although he may
be able to deploy a "US Card" for "Federal Benefits" administratively.  The
risk is that Congress is currently debating mandatory ID legislation without
mentioning it.  The Health Security Act (and some of the current variations)
includes a mandatory "Worker's ID" card that you will need to work for
someone else.  Slick Willy even proudly held it up on TV.  So we may get
mandatory ID without any Congressional debate.

The largest group of US citizens who will not be covered by any proposed
health plan: non-resident US citizens.  A word to the wise.
