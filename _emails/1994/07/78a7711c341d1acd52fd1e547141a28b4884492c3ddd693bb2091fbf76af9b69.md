Neither do I.

Connie's right, guys. How can saying that you like women whose best skills
are oral sex and who are so klutzy that they kill people accidently do
anything to promote civil rights through cryptography? At the least, please
be a little more clear with your sarcasm; otherwise, you're just
re-inforcing the "harmless guy-stuff" that leads directly to rape and
wife-battering.

Drunk driving used to be given a wink and a nod, and now drunk drivers rate
somewhere near lawyers. Let's do the same for women, and promote
cryptography at the same time by getting back on topic.
