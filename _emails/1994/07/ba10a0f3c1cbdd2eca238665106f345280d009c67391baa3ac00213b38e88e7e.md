C'punks,

Today's episode of "Acapulco H.E.A.T." was a treasure trove of
privacy and technology issues.

The story was about a renegade biologist who had "supplied both
sides with biological weapons in the Iran-Iraq war."  It seems
he's now living in South America where he owns a casino and--in
his spare time--is using genetic engineering to create an army of
super-soldiers.  The only example we see, though, is a steroidal
acromegalic who looks like a young Arnold (he has some sort of
European accent, too).

H.E.A.T. "hack" the casino's computers to give themselves a
million dollar line of credit.  In the meantime, they use a
homing device they plant on the bad guys van, they find his
secret jungle lab where they plant a microcam to spy on the bad
guy's genetic operation.

Through the use of a room bug the *fire* into an exterior wall
with a rifle, they learn that the bad guy and an accomplice use
marked cards, which can be read with special contact lenses, to
cheat at chemin de fer.  Using a special hand-held electronic
lock pick, our heroes defeat a card-key hotel lock and break into
the room in which the marked cards are kept.  There, they
substitute their own marked deck.

After that, a fortune gets won, things get blown up, machine-guns
are fired, truth and justice prevail.  The usual.

While this episode had no bikinis, it also had no Fabio.  As they
say in Blackjack, it was a "push."


 S a n d y

P.S.  There was no "Acapulco H.E.A.T." report last week.
      Fabio was in that episode, and he tried to act.
      I was too bilious to write.
