SENT 04-16-94 FROM EBERWEIN_BILL @CASG


    From the White House (President@whitehouse.gov)

     Our electronic communications project has been structured in
three phases.  Phase One established the Internet address, so
that we could begin receiving electronic mail.  Phase Two now
provides a means for interested parties to receive White House
publications.  The goal of Phase Three, which we hope to achieve
soon, is to respond electronically to the substance of incoming
messages.

     Now that Phase Two of our project is complete, we are proud
to announce the Internet address for obtaining White House
documents and publications.  The address is:

               publications@whitehouse.gov

To receive instructions, please send a message to
publications@whitehouse.gov (**do not "reply" to the memo you are
now reading**).  In the body of your message, type "Send Info"
(without quotes); no other text is necessary.  The instructions
will be sent to you automatically.
