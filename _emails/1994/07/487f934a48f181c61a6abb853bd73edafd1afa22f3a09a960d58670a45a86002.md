I think the single most important thing we could do for remailer operators
would be to figure out how to make the remailers *truly* *anonymous*. That
is, we need a net.hack of some sort that allows remailers to send their
messages in a way that leaves no trace whatsoever of the original poster
*and* leaves no trace of the remailer itself.

Net.veterans will perhaps recall a thread I started a while back along
these lines... this is a technical problem, and I have the utmost
confidence that the skills to solve this problem are around here somewhere.
If I may make a humble suggestion, I would suggest that this problem is
more immediate and pressing than many of the issues currently being
debated.

  Philippe
