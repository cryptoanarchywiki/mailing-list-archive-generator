One possible hole here is that since they share a commen algorith then
the algorithm is the 'language' and not the actual messages. This would
mean that you are each using the same language. There is also the aspect
of once discovered you could be charged with obstructing justice which
has very stiff penalties.

They make you participate by giving you immunity in which case you have no
choice but to reveal it or go to jail. Either way somebody is going to jail.
As to self-incrimination, gee, I thought that was the whole purpose of calling
witnesses and such, either to discredit themselves (which is equivalent to
incriminating oneself if you are the defendant) or to incriminate others (and
here we are back to immunity). 

While it is true you can't be held in contempt of court for not providing 
something that doesn't exist they can get you for destroying evidence.
