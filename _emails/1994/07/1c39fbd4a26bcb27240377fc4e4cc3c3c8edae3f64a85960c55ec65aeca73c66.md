Greets, fellow tentacles.

Just a quick note to alert you to the recent Time issue with the cover:

"The Strange New World of the Internet," subtitled "Battles on the 
Frontiers of cyberspace."

Actually, it's a decent article for the neophyte. It goes into detail on
the Cantor & Seigle (boo, hiss) 'Green Card' spam and even mentions
cypherpunks by name.
