The EFF appears to have decided to declare victory... they say they
have "won" the opportunity to shape a better policy.  But almost
nobody else who is on the side of privacy feels the same way.  Even
Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) has officially stated that:

        I have read the July 20th letter from the Vice President about
   the Administration's current thinking on Clipper Chip and, to my
   mind, it represents no change in policy.  In fact, when this letter
   was sent, I would be surprised if the Administration even thought it
   was news.

Is the EFF growing seriously out of touch that an ordinary Senator's
assesment is so obviously more realistic?
