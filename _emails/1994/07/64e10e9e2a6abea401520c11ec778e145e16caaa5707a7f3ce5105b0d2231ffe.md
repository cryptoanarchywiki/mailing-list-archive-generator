As to altering MS-DOS executables, the only option that I see
that someone cannot go through is a dongle with the MD5
image signed by your public key burned on the ROM.  The
dongle will be optional, and for user verification that
the program works.  I wonder if one can boot off the dongle...
have it do its tests in rom on applications....?
