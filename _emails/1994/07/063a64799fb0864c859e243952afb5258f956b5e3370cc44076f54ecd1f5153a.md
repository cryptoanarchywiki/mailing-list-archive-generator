A lot of people can ger really bitchy about 'not being trusted'. In
the hotel I used to work in, if I even asked people to sign the back
of an unsigned card they'd fly off the handle. "Sir, I *am* the acting
manager..."

At the least, they reveal card number, expiration date, transaction
location, amount of purchase and (obviously) time of purchase. I suppose
more could be on the card, but I am not sure what good that would be
(if you have card number, any credit card company is gonna have much
more data on you than will fit on a magnetic strip).

I do wonder how many newer cash registers track purchase -> card number
records, but I doubt this does to card issuers (well, at least not for
free). But this discussion has less and less to do with crypto...
