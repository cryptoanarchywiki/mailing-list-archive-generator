Which rather gives one the impression that the technology transfer program
was forced from above, rather than being their own initiative.

Two suggestions:

1. See your local Congress-critter, and explain that the NSA's Technology
   Transfer program is being subverted.  After all, you guys in the US PAID 
   for the development of this algorithm, and it strikes me as being a bit 
   offensive that you should pay again to see it.

2. FOI it.

I'm rather glad that _I_ didn't ring the number up and ask for the details
("Hello, I am a foreign national.  Can I have this algorithm please?")
I must admit that I was sorely tempted after reading Bruce's post, though!

							Ian.
