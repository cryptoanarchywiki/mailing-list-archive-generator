Did you here about the new Steven King novel?  It called "Children of the  
Net".  It about a group of children who stumble upon an obscure mailing  
list and come under the influence of the evil sysop.  Lots of gore and  
suspense as parents try to regain control of their childrens' minds.  I  
won't reveal how it ends, but it involves a lot of nifty government  
technology.
