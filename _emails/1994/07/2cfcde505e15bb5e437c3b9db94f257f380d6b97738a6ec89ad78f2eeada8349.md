Agreed so far.

Yeah. You're right. Make a table of the backwards DES, then match
against that when attacking the spliting part of the algorithm. I
don't know how I missed that.

Agreed (although I'll point out that my splitting algorithm IS dependent
on both keys/) If I want a fast hash based symetric cipher, I'll use
MDC or Luby-Rackoff.

*sigh*
