yup :-)

good, too.  Of course, it leaves open the question of which should be
inside and which outside.

I'd be most concerned about any ciphertext-only attack which is improved by
having purely random bits as input.  Whichever algorithm is more resistant
to such an attack should be on the outside.  (No, I'm not aware of such an
attack, yet....)

Yes, it's in response to Eli's paper that I advocated prngxor, as in:


         des | prngxor | tran | des | tran | des

with the DES instances in ECB mode (in acknowledgement of Eli's attack).
The prngxor destroys any patterns from the input, which was the purpose of
CBC, without using the feedback path which Eli exploited.
