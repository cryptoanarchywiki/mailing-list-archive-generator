Mandatory carry not (yet) proposed.  Also Ontario Driver's License should
suffice.

How to handle tourists/Canadians/etc.

Already in the Health Security Act.  Doesn't *prevent* treatment just
records it.  You can claim to be an illegal alien, etc.

Doesn't cover driver's licenses issued by any other nations which are also
legal for domestic driving (even by US citizens who are 'non-residents').

Net competition for professional services will soon end licensure in any case.

Perhaps true.

Books?  Doubtfull.  Again what about tourists.

Possible although departure controls are unlikely (and may violate treaties
to which the US is signatory), entry controls will dissolve over time as
travel volume and economic integration swamps any control regime.  The US
currently has 40 million border crossings per year and has 'lost control'.
400 million will be even harder to control.

Possible.

Not a chance.

>Card-scan at your kids' school.

My kids school was outside the jurisdiction.  Home schools would be exempt
in any case.  When Purdy shot up the school in Stockton California I
wondered - perversely - why parents worried about the small risk of their
kids being shot at school when those same kids were guarranteed to be brain
damaged at that same school.

When in doubt, deny your enemies a key field.  Make sure to display multiple
addresses, names, numbers.
