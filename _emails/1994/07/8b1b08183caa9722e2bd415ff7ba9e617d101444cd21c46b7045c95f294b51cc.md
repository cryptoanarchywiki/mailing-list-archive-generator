Ok.  This is arguable itself, but there are a couple comments in the 
legal framework section that are VERY imprtant.

Sure, this is great.  No problems.  This should include visual inspection 
for those who can be verified at a glance, or personal knowledge(like a 
conversation about what you were doing when kenedy died, or the working 
of a company a child would not remember.)

NO!  2 options.,

Make it illegal for a MINOR to misrepresent age and name data to a BBS.

or

Make it illegal to misrepresent age bracket(minor, adult) to a BBS.

The deletion of said data is a nice touch.  I think that this could be 
subject to the same slippery slope arguments that has been used with the 
FFL, though, uping the requirements, raising the time, adding information.

Don't give them an electronic platform that they can amend things onto 
that we will all regret.

?????  This would seem to be covered by 2), what is the deal?  
Forgeries?  If so, I would be concerned about enforcemnent.

NO!  Just cover them in both states.  We know that the feds will try and 
turn this into a national id card and database, they have tried with 
healthcare, drivers licences, tax data, ......... the list is as long as 
my arm.

True, I agree that an effort to head this off is warented, and would work 
for this here.  Send me private e-mail for further discussion.
