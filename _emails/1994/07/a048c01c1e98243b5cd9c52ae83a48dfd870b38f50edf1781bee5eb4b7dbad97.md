Not bad, Gary - you've managed to manufacture a non-existent consensus
of cypherpunk feeling/opinion from thin air, *and* used it to 
address an argument nobody made in the first place. But what will you do
for an encore?

Seriously, speak for yourself. I'm in no hurry to call the P.C. cops of
either the left or the right wing down on Cypherpunks, but a little bit
of respect isn't so much to ask, either.
