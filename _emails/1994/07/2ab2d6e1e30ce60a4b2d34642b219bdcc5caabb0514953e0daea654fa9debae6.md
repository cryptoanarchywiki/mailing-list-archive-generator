The thread was concerning the vulnerability of Double-DES with an
intermediate layer of IDEA in the middle.  It was proposed that if IDEA
could ultimately be TRIVIALLy cracked, then DES-IDEA-DES was no stronger
than Double-DES.  At that point I did some "back of the envelope"
calculations on the cost of breaking Double-DES using a MITM attack.

I'm not sure how "cycles" fit into DES.  The brute-force technique I was
hypothesizing involved trying all possible keys on the encrypt and decrypt
sides, storing them the resultant 64 bit blocks (all 2^60 bytes of them),
then comparing them.  How would Pollard rho speed that up?
