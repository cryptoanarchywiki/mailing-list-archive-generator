".....She's asking you to show respect and courtesy to everyone in the 
forum and the forum because we think of ourselves as part of humanity." 
 You are so kind to speak up for the cause of womanhood and civil 
demonstrations of respect & courtesy (and for this forum, as well).

"Why is everything in our society in terms of "Us vs. Them"?"  One 
reason is because some people are looking more for heat than light.

"This can't even be called a society. It is a battlefield."  However, 
somewhere in the heat of ideological battles some productive 
conclusions are reached; such as that some people will not be 
influenced by other's opinions and that it is useless to attempt to 
make conclusions for everyone without their expressed consent.

"Here's hoping the positive vibrations of the Jupiter-trumpet will beam 
into OUR lives and wreak a positive transformation."  I think Jupiter 
is suffering from problems of its own, at this time, being bombarded by 
a string of meteors.   Let us hope we (on planet Earth) don't receive the same.
