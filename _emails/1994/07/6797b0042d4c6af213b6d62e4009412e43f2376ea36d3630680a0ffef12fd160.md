I was slightly suspicious of this posting at first. But I don't see
what damage replying would do. My only reservation is that I find many of 
the "SUBJECT" titles too vague for proper analysis. After all, "discrete"
mathematics covers quite a lot. So I'll just go through it bit by
bit...

Well, yes... I have had quite a bit of discrete mathematics. However I
wouldn't be able to categorize it into one snappy word entry. I am mainly
interested in group theory (and am in fact doing my B. Sc. on it). Other
interests: combinatorics, digital communications, set theory, and of
course, everyone's favourite: cryptology and number theory. Oh... does
this section include high-school as well?

Assuming that "algebra"="discrete Maths", I have had ~10 odd little subjects
concerning this. Only the first 2 fell into "algebra1". As for "algebra2",
yes, we did use Fraleigh for it, but we packed it into a semester.

At the U. of Q. (and a lot of other Australian Universities), the B.Sc. (and
B.A.) is a flat three year course. Doing Honours takes an extra year, and is
classified as postgraduate). So I guess I fall into the "yes" category.

I think I answered this above.

I've never actually done any oral exams. Just a few seminar presentations.

Nope. Nope. Nope.

No Problem.

However, as there seems to be some misunderstanding on my part (due to
the different curriculum), I guess that if anyone posts this quiz in future,
there would have to be some redesigning for people from different edu-
cational systems. For example, Engineering is a separate course from
Science down here. I think this is not true in the U.S. (I could be wrong).


Peter.
