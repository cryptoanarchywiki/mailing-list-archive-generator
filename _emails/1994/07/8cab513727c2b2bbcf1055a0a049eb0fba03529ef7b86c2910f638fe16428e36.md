There are two things to be paranoid about. One is that other people could
get access to your information. The other is that you might loose access to
your information and the ability to autheniticate yourself.

My personal comfort level is currently: having a few coppies of the secret
key which I keep physical control over,  only using PGP on my personal
computer, and protecting it with a very inconvinient passphrase. Should I
also mention that I keep the key, PGP, and all my other crypto stuff on an
encrypted partition?
