I'd called it "grassroots," myself.

Did the EFF actually make this call (for the House Rules lobbying)?  I
thought it was a different organization.  Stanton McCandlish has a tendancy
to forward anything vaguely EFF'ish to many, many places.  He also
forwarded that idiocy called "Telco Snooping" a while back.  Does that mean
the EFF supports/believes that?  I hope not, or my membership dollars (and
AT&T, and whoever else's) are being wasted.

If the EFF did make this call, I agree they need to be reacting a bit
quicker.  The ability to get information out quickly and fairly cheaply is
what the net/InfoBahn/Information Superhighway is all about.
