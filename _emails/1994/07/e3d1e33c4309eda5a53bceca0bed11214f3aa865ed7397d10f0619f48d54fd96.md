Thanks for your thoughtful comments.  However the message was 
not by me but by Sherry May <scmay@rschp2.anu.edu.au>.

I forwarded it from talk.politics.crypto where it has produced 
an interesting thread with good discussions.  Tim May pointed 
to this thread on c'punks a few days ago and has joined the 
fray there.

I agree with Tim's statement there that Sherry has initiated a 
topic of substance by her letter.  I hope that c'punks will 
respond as well.
