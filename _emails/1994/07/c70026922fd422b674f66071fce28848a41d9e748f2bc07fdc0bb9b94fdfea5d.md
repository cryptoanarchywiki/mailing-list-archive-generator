A recent RISKS digest had an article that described a computer that 
simulated a colony of ants with independent software units that 
interacted in certain ways. The article said that the "ants" were able to 
find an efficient solution to the traveling salesman problem.

Wouldn't such a system be perfect for a public key cryptosystem? It seems 
that mechanisms already designed for knapsack algorithms would work; it 
would remain to be worked out if the traveling salesman problem has the 
same cryptographic problems as the knapsack problem.
