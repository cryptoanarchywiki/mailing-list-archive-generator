This mindless and erroneous drivel was published on alt.2600 and
several other groups about a month ago and has been refuted at
length.  It's just some idiot trying to wind people up.  Yes,
there's a tiny teensy grain of truth behind it, but just about
every detail is verifiably wrong.

Believe me, I'm one of the people here who is actively looking
out for this sort of stuff and I know what's True Dope and what's
bullshit, and this is bullshit.
