PGP gurus, 

I don't follow the ins and outs of PGP very closely, and I can't find
anything on this directly in my archived articles.

Someone has told me that pre-MIT versions of PGP may have compromised
security because "the session key is hashed solely from the
plaintext."

Is this true? What's the significance? Is there any weakness?


Thanks,

--Tim
