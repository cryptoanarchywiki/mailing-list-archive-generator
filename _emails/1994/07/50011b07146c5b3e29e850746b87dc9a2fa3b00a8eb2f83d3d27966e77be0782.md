For the record -- 1 year probation, 400 hrs community service, large
fine ($10K if I recall right.) *NO* actual jail time... it wasn't at
all clear that the vendors weren't guilty too :-)

Crypto relevance? Well, he *did* keep his files encrypted -- but they
got them in cleartext from backups that ran during times he was
working on them -- ie, human error :-) It wouldn't have helped him to
use PGP. Oh, and all the strings in the program were encrypted with
"XOR 0x81", not all that hard to crack.

still in draft form, I'm missing some edits from the final printing.
