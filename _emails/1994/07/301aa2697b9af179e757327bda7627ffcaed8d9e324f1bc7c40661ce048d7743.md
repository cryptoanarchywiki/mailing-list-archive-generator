I think that a practical scheme has to be able to work when the button on
the remote can be activated away from the garage door: What about kids
using the remote as a phaser while playing a game of Star Trek, showing off
your new cryptographic garage door remote to a friend, dropping a book on
top of the remote in the car, being a little too hasty and pressing the
button while still a few feet out of range of the garage door, a fidgety
passenger picking up the remote and playing with it while in the car, etc.?
