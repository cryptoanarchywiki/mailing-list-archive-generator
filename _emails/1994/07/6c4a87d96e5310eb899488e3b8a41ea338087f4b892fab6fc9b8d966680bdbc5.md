    Geeez!  If it's just the name, then call this newest version 
    "TAP" for "Totally Awesome Privacy", or something similar.

I've been sending a cousin-in-law some information on privacy issues
and the net.  She's works in a policy office in DC and she's currently
working on a series of monographs relating to such things.  Among this
stuff has been, of course, information on PGP.  Apparently, her boss
asked something along the lines of `If it's so good, why is it only
Pretty Good Privacy' -- he apparently has a general problem of taking
things very literally.

He also apparently won't let employees take disks home because they
might infect them with viruses and them bring them back in.  Of
course, he doesn't stop them from bringing in disks that *weren't*
originally taken home from the office . . . .
