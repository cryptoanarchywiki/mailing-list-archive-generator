I see governments as representing the collective will of society, responsible 
for only those things that are best achieved through everyone's cooperation.
It is now fashionable to talk about the Asian way -- subjugating freedom to
prosperity. This is of course bunkum, freedom is an ideal and is universal. The
way to get to that may differ from society to society, particularly, as Michael
says, in poor nations. It isn't necessary to have a strong state to survive;
India, with a similar standard of living in 1950, has been democratic with
more or less regular, free and fair elections. Contrary to popular perception,
India has been no more 'socialist' than many European countries such as France,
with stockmarkets and large state-owned enterprises. It is naturally more
difficult to control crime or rising population here than in China, where petty
thieves and corrupt officials are frequently executed.

Freedom is a right equally applicable everywhere, whatever the political, social
or economic situation. Any technology that promotes it is important for the
whole world.
