So the problem we are now looking at is when a prior user and the bank team
up, the person who finally redeems the cash at the bank can be identified
as handling cash that the colluding user previously had. There is a simple
solution to this, if you are this paranoid, don't redeem the cash yourself,
just pass it to a non-bank. Once you do this NOTHING can be determined
about you unless you double spend. (Unless the bank's private key is
recovered.)
