None mathematically.  A friend of mine (denaro09@darwin.poly.edu) has an
interesting thought on this.  If the NSA does have any method of screwing
RSA in any way, it's probably optimized for the common key lengths for PGP.
ie: 512, 1024, etc.  So he uses a 1023 bit key.  That one bit less may be
unsecure for him, but the idea is still sound.  Maybe a 1025 bit key would
give them less of an advantage.  Even so this is all speculation.  We don't
know what the NSA knows...
