     Ok, what if PGP-encyphered text were argued to be COMPILED? In that
case, the original SOURCE CODE was being shared, and the COMPILER being
held secret. Source-reading keys are available upon request. Or some twist
like that. :-) What do you think? All of a sudden, we have compiled source
code being pushed around that is VERY difficult to reverse engineer
without the proper authorization.
