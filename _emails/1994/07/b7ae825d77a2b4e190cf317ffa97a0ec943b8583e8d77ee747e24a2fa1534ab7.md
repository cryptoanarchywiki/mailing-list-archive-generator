The following is worth mentioning: market forces will eventually
destroy virtually all controls. However, as the Soviet Union showed,
millions of people can be made miserable or killed in the meanwhile.
The mere fact that internal passports (what the ID cards are, really
-- another friend of mine called them that the minute he heard of
them) would not stop everyone doesn't mean that they couldn't make
almost everyone's life miserable.
