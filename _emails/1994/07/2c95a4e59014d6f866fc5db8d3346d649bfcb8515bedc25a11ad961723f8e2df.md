One thing I haven't understood with this "LEGAL_KLUDGE" business, where
the command line is kind of cumbersome.  Can't you get the same effect
by setting the parameters in the config.txt file?  If so you just add
two lines and forget it.  I haven't looked at PGP 2.6 so I don't know
why this wouldn't work.  It would certainly seem to simplify things.
