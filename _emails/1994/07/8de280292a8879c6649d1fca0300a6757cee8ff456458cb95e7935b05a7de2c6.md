The first amendment is a good start.
The fourth amendment protections against unreasonable search could be
held to not require that everyone conduct all their business in such a
way as to make search maximally easy. (The courts have already held,
for instance, that you are under no obligation to keep your business
records in english.)
The ninth amendment, and the derived "right to privacy" ideas that
culminated in Roe v. Wade, could also be invoked.
