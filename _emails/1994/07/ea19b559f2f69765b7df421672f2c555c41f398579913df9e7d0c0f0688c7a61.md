Several points:

1. Adi Shamir sold out what little share he had some years back. He has
no financial links to PKP or RSADSI.

2. Shamir is Israeli. (This has led to more than one humorous
situation in which Shamir has received notification from the U.S.
government that he cannot "export" something he's working on--as an
Israeli, living in Israel.)

3. Shamir was the coinventor (with Biham), or at least the recent
rediscoverer, of differential cryptanalysis. He apparently felt no
constraint to not publish.

4. Some of the others I listed, such as Odzylko, are in fact the known
leaders of making improvements in factoring. (Not that various linear
factors matter much, in the long run, of course.)

It's only speculation as to the relative competence of mathematicians
inside vs. outside the NSA; my main point remains that the outside
community is very dynamic and robust and shows no signs that I can see
of holding back on reporting breakthroughs.

Nor could a major breakthrough be contained, I think.
