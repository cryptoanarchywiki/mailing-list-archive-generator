In Britain we have 'TV detector Vans'. These are to detect licence 
evaders (you need to pay an annual licence for the BBC channels). They 
are provided by the Department of Trade and Industry. They use something 
like a small minibus and use Van Eck principles. They have two steerable 
detectors on the van roof so they can triangulate. But TV shops have to 
notify the Government of buyers - so that is the basic way in which 
licence evaders are detected.
I read of a case on a bulletin board where someone did not have a TV but 
used a PC. He got a knock on the door. They said he appeared to have a TV 
but they could not make out what channel he was watching!
