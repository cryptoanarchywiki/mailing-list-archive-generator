I agree with Graham Toal that forwardings are getting out of hand. 

I'm quick on the "Delete" key, as Sandy Sandfort is, so it doesn't
bother me _too_ much. But what it does indicated is general
cluelessness.

For example, minutes ago I received yet another forwarding of the
"USACM" press release! Did the forwarder think we had not seen the
versions sent yesterday?

Or perhaps he was not reading the list closely enough to see these
forwardings--and thought we needed another copy just for good measure.

My solution is to keep a list (manually) of folks who have acted
thusly, and then to avoid responding to them in the future. (I can't
easily implement kill files in "elm.")

I might suggest a "press release list" that people could subscribe to,
except that alternate lists have failed, and the forwarders are
unlikely to remain confined to such a narrow forum. And as Graham
noted, numerous newsgroups already exist for such press releases.

I have to admit that I've started to ignore most EFF, CPSR, and EPIC
press releases, as they are low on content and heavy on long-winded
policy statements.
