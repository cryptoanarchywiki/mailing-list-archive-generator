Agreed.  You may love sailing and decide to live near a busy harbor.
But if you have children, you will probably want low fences between them
and the water.	When they get older and have better judgement and motor
control, they will also be able to step over the low fence.  This is
the way that most human beings handle their children, with restrictions
that disappear gradually as the children grow up.

The Internet is a wild and exciting place.  You want your children to
get to know it.  But you would also like a way to build little fences
between them and some things that they are just too young to deal with.
How do you do it?
