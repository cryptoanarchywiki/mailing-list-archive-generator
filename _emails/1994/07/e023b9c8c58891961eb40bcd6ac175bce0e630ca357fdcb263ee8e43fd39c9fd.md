Or could it be possible to put out enough 'garbage' radiation to throw 
them off? it seems to me that if you knew which frequencies to use, you 
could blast out cryptographicly random white radio noise which would make 
it imposible to determine what was 'good stuff'. Basicly the concept is 
to encrypt all of your wasted radiation with a one-time pad, and throw 
away the keys.

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
