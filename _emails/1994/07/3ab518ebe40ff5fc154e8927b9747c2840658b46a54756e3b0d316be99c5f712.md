Try using 4 dicts next time, adverb, adj, noun, and verb.

Afterall, "wombats drill telephones with vitamin b12 ,but ports know 
shelves only with cyano groups." sounds nice, but "sofa loveseat table lamp 
chair shelf coatrack futon" is not nice at all, and less secure.

Another option is to let the user page through 3-4 options untill they 
find one they "like" in that position.
