I believe OSC is now ready to use (if they haven't started already) their
modified L-1011 TriStar launch platform ("Stargazer").

I'm not sure the 747 would be as easily modified, based on the design of
the wing box and landing gear.  Similar issues would probably apply to the
McDD DC-10/MD-11.
