     I must admit that I'm disappointed.  I figured people on this
list would assume good faith on the part of other list members until
it was demonstrated otherwise.

     I read your entire post.  You advocate using the government to
force people to behave as you see fit.  I pointed out that the
services you want could be offered without the need for more
legislation.

     The cable and telephone companies _offer_ these services.  You
propose mandating what is provided.

     And on the Department of Internet Connectivity and Hiding Erotic
Data (DICHED).

     What's wrong with leaving the sysops free to protect themselves
as they see fit?
