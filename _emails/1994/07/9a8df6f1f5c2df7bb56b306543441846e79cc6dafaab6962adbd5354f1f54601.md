From the beginning, it has been clear to me that the whole thing about
crypto export prohibitions enhancing national security is just a smoke
screen.  While there may be a germ of truth to those kinds of statements,
the _real_ reason for propping export controls up when they are no longer
effective, and no longer make sense, is to fragment the worldwide market
and give weakened state-sponsored encryption a window of opportunity to
become a standard.

As such, I'm not upset at how the administration finally is publicly
acknowledging their abuse of export control law for anti-democratic ends.
I'm just upset at their abuse, and consider it highly unethical, even
criminal.

It's ironic that those who are engaging in these unethical, anti-
democratic acts are also asking us to trust them with access to our most
private conversations...
