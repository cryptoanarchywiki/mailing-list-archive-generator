My first post, although I've been *listening* for some time now. I'm all for 
privacy and private encryption, and am learning a lot from this list - just 
installed PGP on two platforms and am learning how to use it. I agree that 
there are very few women involved - is this an all boys club? I assume not, 
but have to say I find lines like the above very offensive/non-professional. 
I won't let it stop me from continuing on, but what's the point? I really 
don't get it.

CS -
