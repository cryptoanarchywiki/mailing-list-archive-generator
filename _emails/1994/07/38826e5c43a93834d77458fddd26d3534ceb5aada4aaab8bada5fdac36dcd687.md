Does anybody have any experience doing stockholder resolutions?

Even though they seldom pass, they are one way of pressuring a company
to do things, and if well written can have a big impact (e.g. a
resolution that Microsoft/AT&T/Apple/Network23 "never compromise
the privacy of their customers data by using key escrow" puts management
in a position of either supporting the resolution (yay!) or
saying "no, sometimes we're willing to compromise our customer's privacy",
followed by weasel words about how it's Good For America and therefore
Good For General Motors or whatever.

			Thanks;  Bill
