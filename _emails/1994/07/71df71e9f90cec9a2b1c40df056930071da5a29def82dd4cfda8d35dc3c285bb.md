This isn't something that needs to be argued.  If "Sue" is Larry
and reveals this through his or her actions, so be it.  If he/she isn't,
or doesn't, that's great.  (I do have to wonder, though, who else
would remail messages with Detweiler's "Organization: CRAM" header.)

Actually, we're all T.C.May.

Could you elaborate on what you mean by this?  I doubt many people on
the list think that a full-blown _1984_ is just around the corner.
Some of us are, however, not enamored of Clipper, Digital Telephony,
ITAR, a National I.D. Card, or the like.  I trust this does not
constitute a full-blown "police-state mentality".

Hmm.  I hope millenarianism works better now than it did the first
time around.
