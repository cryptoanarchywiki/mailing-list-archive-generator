And if you find any ex-slaves alive in America, I'll support you 
on that.  OTOH, at 130 years of age, I doubt that any of them are 
paying much in the way of taxes.

But, maybe you're on to something here.  Let's expand that to ANY 
AMERICAN whose ancestors suffered in any way.  That would do away 
with the Federal Income Tax entirely.  I LIKE THAT!!!
