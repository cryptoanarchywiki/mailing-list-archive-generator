: My reading of the BSA blurb was that software key escrow really is
: being planned: "software implementable [and] based on a non-classified
: encryption formula".  Yes, this sounds pretty silly.  I don't see how
: you could possibly prevent a rogue phone from interoperating with a
: fascistic one.

... except by legislation.  Make no bones about it, this is the start of
the final attack to outlaw non-escrowed encryption.
