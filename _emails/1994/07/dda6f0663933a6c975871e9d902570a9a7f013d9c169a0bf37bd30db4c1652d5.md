The Alliance for Bandwidth Conservation (ABC), asked me to point out:

LD's account is anon????@nyx.cs.du.edu (? = hex digit).  This is the
first I knew of this, but it doesn't surprise me -- Nyx is a public
access site at the University of Denver.   And please don't all
mailbomb his overworked sysadmin (who volunteers his time to run Nyx),
right away.  LD's been fairly mild lately, compared to last Nov-Dec.  I
think it suffices for him to know that this will occur if he becomes
abusive -- damn surprised he mentioned Nyx, in fact!  His sysadmin
*can* correlate anon accounts with True Names, if necessary.

btw, anyone can telnet there and read the list gated as newsgroup
mail.cypherpunks.  You'll have to jump through some hoops to be able
to post from there, though.

Sigh...awaiting the (awestrop = Detweiler?) thread,
