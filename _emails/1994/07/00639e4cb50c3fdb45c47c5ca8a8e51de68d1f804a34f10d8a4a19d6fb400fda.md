Sounds like an application for a "challenge-response" system. But that
would require transmission from garage unit to car unit.

If there were syncnronized clocks then the signal could be a function of
time so that the above replay would fail. That requires only a PRNG.

Both units could compute the next password from the same PRNG but this
would require a "backspace" button on the car unit for those occasions
where the garage unit failed to hear a broadcast signal. A "reset to new
known state" for both units would be required for when the state became
hoplessly confused.
