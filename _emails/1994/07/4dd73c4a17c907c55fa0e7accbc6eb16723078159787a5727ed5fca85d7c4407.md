I regret that I've been too busy to comment on much on the left vs.
right debate here, but Mats Bergstrom's analysis merit's comment:

"Mayists"! Kind of like Maoists--but different!

Yes, I've seen few if any of these extremes on this list.

Mats has accurately captured the flavor of crypto anarchy, and how it
differes from more conventionally libertarian anarchocapitalist views.
Specifically, large corporations are unlikely to thrive...for the
simple Cyperpunkish reason that a large group can't very well keep
secrets. (I'm not arguing that an Intel or a Pfizer _deserves_ to have
its secrets sold, only that this is a consequence of increased
informational degrees of freedom, privacy, and strong crypto.)

I'm suspicious about the "minimal standard of living" point, though,
but will note that private charity tends to work when the
disabled/retarded component of the population is less than about 10%.
(When more and more people claim disabilities, inability to work,
psychic damage, or just plain unwillingness to work, charity won't
work. And my belief is that coercion of charity (=taxes) also won't
work.)

But I mostly agree with everything Mats has said. Leftists should take
heart that crypto anarchy also reduces the power of corporations (many
of whom climb into bed with government the first chance they get to
suppress competition, get favorable laws and patents, etc. As
Mussolini said, "Fascism *is* corporatism.")

Many leftists I know claim to be anti-capitalist, naturally. But they
are often deeply market-oriented, participating in "farmer's markets"
with zeal. To libertarians, of course, this *is* capitalism! (Read
Karl Hess' "Capitalism for Kids" for an easy treatment of this. Lots
of other libertarian books, too.)

This list has traditionally not been a place to debate left-right or
libertarian issues. Passing references, yes, but not serious debate.
In accord with this unwritten rule, I'll stop now.
