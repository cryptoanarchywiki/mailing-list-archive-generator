Thank you for posting this article.  While it contained materials we are
all aware of, I'm sure the Newbies on this list will appreciate it.  I've
saved it incase someone who isn't too familiar with crypto asks me to give
him/her some info.  Your service to this list is well worth while.  Keep
up the good work. :-)
