Actually, no. I couldn't care less about what pushes your buttons.
I came across a couple of crypto related usenet messages that were 
going in the bit bucket, no reference to them had been made. Yes
I could have typed and typed and typed various messages about them
but it was easier to forward them.

I also pay for my accounts out of my own pocket. If you expect to be 
active in a field you can expect to have to pay a minimum price to become
competant. 

Bounce away, my 'd' key works just fine. I personaly feel such attitudes
are childish but hey, it is a semi-free country - do what you feel is right.

As to making me pay, is this the c-punks mailing list or a shool-yard?
