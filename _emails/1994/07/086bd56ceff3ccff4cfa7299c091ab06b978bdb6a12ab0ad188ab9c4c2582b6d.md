    I guess when I first forwarded this to the list, the header
    was not included.  What follows is the entire posting from
    the ba.jobs.contract Usenet group which includes the name of
    the person who posted it.  dberg@netcom.com is the person to
    answer all questions about the job.

The only sane way to count the number of 1 bits in a byte is to use
a lookup table:

	return table[result];

On an intel chip this produces ONE opcode:

	XLAT
