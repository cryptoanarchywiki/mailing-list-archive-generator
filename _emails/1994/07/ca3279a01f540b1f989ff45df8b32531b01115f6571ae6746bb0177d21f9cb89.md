I, for one, believe that the net is unstoppable -- and that no attempt to
 censor it will work in the long run (or in the short run), short of
 making networking computers illegal and unpopular.  If people want
 to communicate, they will -- it's no different than day-to-day conversation
 in realspace: you can't monitor an entire world of individuals, short of
 pretty hefty AI -- even with no encryption.  

It's going to be a long and bloody process while people figure this out,
 though, and I'm not sure how recognizable our society will be once the
 message gets through.  I'm considering moving to New Zealand for the
 duration.

Or at least Texas.  [But I'll need money first.  Buy some e-books. :)]
