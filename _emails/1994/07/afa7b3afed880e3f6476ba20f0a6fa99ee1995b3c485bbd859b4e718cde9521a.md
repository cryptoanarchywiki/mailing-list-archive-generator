How many of us have suffered from this attack? I just recieved a message
indicating an annon ID had been created for this account. The account I
acctualy have an anon ID for has not been affected as far as I know. Since
this account, and not the other, is used for posting to Cypherpunks I
suspect that the attacker is using a list of recent posters (I did post
from the other account to this group in the distant past).

Is there any remidy we can use? I gather there is no way to invalidate an
anonymous ID. I guess I will just assign a password and not annon mail from
this account. :(
Has Julf been contacted about this?

My anon ID from this attack is: an118079@anon.penet.fi
I will not be using this ID, and will have it revoked ASAP.
Anything from that account is not from me. Check the signature.
Let me know if it is used.
