Citizen-Unit Markowitz is hereby advised that his permission to exit
is being revoked. The New World Order mandates the widespread
deployment of DigiCash (TM--U.S. Department of Justice); your digital
account can then be cancelled upon receipt of Identity Revocation
Orders.

We shall triumph. It shall be a shining era of golden harmony and
meticulous order, mediated by the glistening bits of the digiverse.
All things in their places, and all actions for the good of the State.
