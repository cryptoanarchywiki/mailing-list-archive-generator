"Nobody" asks whether you really get 128 bits of entropy out of MD5
if you put in fewer bits, and whether you need to put in more than
128 bits of entropy to get 128 bits of entropy out.  (This is mainly
relevant for the case where you iterate MD5 N times for large N.)

Entropy = -sum ( p(Xi) * log2(p(Xi) ) , Xi { outcomes of a random event X }
which is the sum of the amount of information each event gives you times the
probability of the event occurring.  In this application, the events are
"the input to MD5 is" and "the output from MD5 is", and each input is one
of many (presumably independent) values leading to the same output.

You know that Entropy(MD5(Xi)) is <= 128, since there are only 2**128
possible outputs, and they're supposedly equiprobable given random input.
If the distribution of the Xi's is known, and it has substantially lower
entropy than 128 bits, then the output also has lower entropy, since the
probability of MD5(Xi) appearing is the probability of Xi.

There's a bit more entropy lost in the MD5 step - if MD5(Xi) = MD5(Xj),
-p(Xi|Xj)*log(p(Xi|Xj) < -p(Xi)*log(p(Xi)) + -p(Xj)*log(p(Xj)).
On the other hand, collisions are infrequent - the probability of a
pair of numbers having the same MD5 value is presumed to be 2**-128,
and the usual birthday paradox calculations apply, so you'll probably
find one if you take 2**64 random samples.

At this point, knowing the details of the MD5 algorithm *does* matter;
you can analytically find a few pairs of inputs that have the same
MD5 value - but if you're choosing random inputs it's not likely to happen.
If you could analytically invert MD5 (it's presumed that you can't,
even for the 128-bit-input case), or store the results in a 2**128 large
lookup table (:-), you could find out exactly how much lossage there is.
Don't worry about it :-)

If you still *are* worried about it, however, you can scramble things a bit;
since MD5 produces 128 bits of output but uses 448 bits of input+padding,
you can add a different constant to the input at each step.
If you're using it as a salt, put it at the beginning; if you're
just doing it for multiple iterations it doesn't matter much.
