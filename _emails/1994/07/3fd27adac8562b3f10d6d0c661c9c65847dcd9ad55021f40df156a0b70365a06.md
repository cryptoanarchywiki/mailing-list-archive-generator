Only marginally topical if at all but the .sig about Irish citizenship 
prompted me to remember something I had heard: is it true that if you can 
prove German ancestry sometime since the unification of Germany (the 
first time), you can get citizenship there easily? Germany has its 
repressive laws but two of my great-grandparents came from what was 
formerly Prussia a little over 100 years ago.

Wes thu hal,
