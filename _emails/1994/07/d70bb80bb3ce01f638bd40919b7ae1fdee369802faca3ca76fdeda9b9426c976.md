Somehow, I get the idea that the "nobody" you're referring to is yours 
truly.  Well, I'm not him, but your suspicion does bring up a valuable 
point, though:  if you're suspicious that a certain "chained remailer user" 
is the infamous Mr. Mitnik, then certain TLAs might also share that 
suspicion.  Therefore, anyone using such "underground" services as 
anonymous remailers should use exceeding care.  If they start to use 
traffic analysis, or any of the other "sigint" techniques discussed here, 
even though you aren't Mr. Mitnik, you may well get "caught" in their 
"dragnet".
