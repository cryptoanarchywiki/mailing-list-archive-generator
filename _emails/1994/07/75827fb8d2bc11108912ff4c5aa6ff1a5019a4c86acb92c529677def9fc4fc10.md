That the NSA contracted National Semiconductor to build a facility
on-site has been common knowledge since 1989-90. The fab is not state
of the art (i.e., is not 1.8 micron or better) and is believed to be
used for the very reasonable purpose of producing keying material in a
secure environment (ROMs, PROMs, fuse-linked micros, PLAs, etc.). It
is unlikely--but possible--that high-performance micros are being
manufactured there.

*** We were tracking NSA purchases of material over a decade ago; as for their 
usage of the technology, my statement was simply that they felt, after serious 
analysis, that they couldn't trust commercial silicon.  The issue was trust, not
computation power.

This is nonsense. A typical 1024-bit RSA system uses p and q close to
512 bits each, e.g., 511 and 513. Whatever.

Now a 512-bit number is a 150-plus decimal digit number. About .5-1%
of all of these numbers are prime (by the Prime Number Theorem, or
somesuch...about 1/N of all N-digit numbers are prime, as I recall).

How big a keyspace is this to start searching "systematically"?
Considering that there are "only" about 10^73 particles of all kinds
in the entire universe (based on our best estimate of the size of the
universe, the density of galaxies, gas clouds, etc.), this means that
if every particle in the universe were searching for and recording the
primes they discovered, each particle would have to store 10^77
primes!

So much for "a powerful systematic search for primes that fit that
range."

*** You assume that your selection of primes is random; it is the case, 
particularly in the initial usages of public-key systems, that attacks could be 
made on keyspaces based on the prime generation method.  A point that 
number-crunch jockeys tend to forget is that psychology and systems analysis 
provide greater in-roads against secure systems than brute force.

"Parallel versus scalar processing"? Parallelism means nothing at
these scales...see the above point.

*** Your point is orthogonal to our point.  The two systems are used for 
different attacks--parallelism can be used for exhaustive search, such as for 
DES keys, while scalar processing can be used for testing primality.
