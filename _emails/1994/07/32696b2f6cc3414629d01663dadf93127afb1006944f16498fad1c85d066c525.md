Hi Mathew Ghio. Ask, and you shall receive. You complain about my current
campaign and report that you have shut down your remailer because of it.
My sincere apologies. As I wrote, it is not my intention to sabotage
any remailers. I was sending you messages at a gentle pace (not nearly
as much as you claim for sympathy), but apparently it was too much!

So I will take you off the current mailing list. I'm sorry to see you
go. I may add you in the future at some unspecified time, however.
This will help encourage your inspired and highminded attention to
carefully filtering and screening every incoming message to your remailer
which you have grandly demonstrated.  I think I speak for all other 
members of the Reich in saying that we are proud of your extremely patriotic 
commitment to censorship and upholding our cause.  Any user of your 
highly secure system will surely be flush with pride.

I wish I had more men who are as dedicated as you are. I have grand
plans for my brethen that will soon, very soon, be coming to fruition.
The first few `triggers' are the drastic earth cataclysms (not the
least of which will be Operation Shake-and-Bake in CA, commencing
shortly) that will help plunge the world into an anarchy that is more 
receptive to our way of thinking. The paranoia and deadly cynicism against 
government will help too. But the most important brick of all, of course, 
is the deification of cyberspace.

I would love to expound on these subjects more but I have to keep
a `low profile' at the moment. The time has not come yet.

Thanks again for your contributions.
