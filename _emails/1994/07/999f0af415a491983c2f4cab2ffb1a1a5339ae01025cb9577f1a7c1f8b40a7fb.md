Tim May:

| I reject key escrow, and I don't worry overmuch about export of crypto
| or what it does to the competitiveness of Novell and Microsoft. (By
| this I mean that end-to-end encryption is usually a big win over
| product-integrated, officially-sanctioned crypto....and no export laws
| will stop powerful, unofficially-sanctioned end-to-end crypto from
| being used.)

	The benifit to product integrated crypto is that if Microsoft
puts RSA into Chicago, there are suddently 60 mil. RSA users.  OTOH,
if Microsoft puts A5 into Chicago, there are suddenly zillions of A5
users.  There is a benefit to having big companies like IBM, HP, or
Sun provide strong crypto, and that is it makes it look more
respectable to the large corporation.
