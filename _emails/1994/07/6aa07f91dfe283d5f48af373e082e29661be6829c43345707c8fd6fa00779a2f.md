I think a simple key seeded MD5 work work fine for garage doors:

The remote can transmit: (n, M(n^k))

Where n is random (and so doesn't repeat often), k is a shared key
known only to the remote and the door opener, and M is a reasonably
strong hash function.  k could be set by a bank dip switches, but
to get a large enough key space would require alot of switches.
