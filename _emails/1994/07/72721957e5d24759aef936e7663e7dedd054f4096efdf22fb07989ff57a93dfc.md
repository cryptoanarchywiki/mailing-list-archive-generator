I realize this may seem absurd, but for the sake of humor could there be
any relationship between the Dept. of Justice near pardon of Microsoft on
charges of Anti-trust and the potential adoption of a software encryption
standard in Chicago with the blessing of NIST and some goverment agencies.

Would it be ridiculous conspirancy theorizing to think that MS and Justice
made a deal?

I have nothing to back this up, just reading the news and cypherpunks.
