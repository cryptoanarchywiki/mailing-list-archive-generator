I feel the same way.  I posted an article from the Mercury News to here about
three weeks ago, reporting on a conference between the White House and
several private cryptography companies, where they were trying to work
out some kind of private sector EES.  So, this has been in the works for
some time.  I can dig up the article for anybody that would like to see it.

I'd buy stock in TIS, if it were a public company, I'd guess that they will
have the inside track on this.
