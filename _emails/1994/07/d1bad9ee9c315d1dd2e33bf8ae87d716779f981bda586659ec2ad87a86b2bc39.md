I make a point of using at least one non-dictionary word in every passphase
I make. That is one word not from this or any other language. It seems to
me that the inclustion of such a word somewhere in the password is going to
render the dictionary attack useless (since it is not possible to tell when
you are close).
It seems to me that, although I can not prove it, one does not have to
introduce may non-dictionary elements before a simple brute force becomes
simpler than a dictionary attack. How does one exploit the 1 bit per
character of english, if it is not known what parts of the phrase (if any)
are in standard english?
