	(Excerpted & paraphrased from todays (22 July 1994) Boston Globe:)

	Raytheon won an 800 billion dollar, six year contract with the
government of Brazil to provide monitoring of the Amazon vs. drug &
mineral smugglers.

	System will employ telecomm, satelite imagery, ground & air
based monitoring to monitor an area more than 1/2 the size of the US.
System will use unspecified defense converted technologies.

	System will reduce deforestation & wildlife destruction,
combat illegal mining & drug trafficing, protect indigenous tribes,
*monitor traffic*, stengthen border controls.

	Team members include IBM/Brasil, INFRANAV, a Brasilian
militray contracter, MacDonald Dettwiler (hmmm) of canada, and others.


	The article fawns about how nice it will be for Raytheon not
to go out of buisness.  Raytheon has been having difficulty recently,
since the Army decided to go with a longer range anti-missile system,
bypassing future Patriot missile purchases.

	"If Brazil wins the world Cup, the government will be able to
pass the most repressive legislation ever, and no one will care."

Politics.  From the greek "poly," meaning many, and ticks, a small,
annoying bloodsucker.
