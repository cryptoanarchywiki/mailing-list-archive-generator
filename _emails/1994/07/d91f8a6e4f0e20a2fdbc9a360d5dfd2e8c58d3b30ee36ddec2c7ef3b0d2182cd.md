Maybe Tim needs to leave the People's Republic of Kalifornia and go into
"internal exile" in one of the United States which is less invasive.

"Haven't read much SF since I found the Net since it seems 'wrong' now.
Left with military SF usually sited in 'other places/other times' where the
lack of the Net doesn't interfere with enjoyment.  Just finished "Guns of
the South" by Harry Turtledove.  Usual Lee vs Grant in the Battle of the
Wilderness with AK-47s.  Even if you don't like the Second American
Revolution (Civil War) or military SF, a hell of a story.  Every character
in it (save those from 2014) is a historical character.  Look for the cover
art of Lee with an AK-47."
