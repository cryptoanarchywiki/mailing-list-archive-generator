Cypherpunks,

For those of you who have not seen my public policy on the use of the
catalyst remailer, this excerpt:

  >  - 3 -  I do not own the machine my remailer is running on.  In fact it is
  >         a commercial system.  Be nice.  If they ask me to stop running my
  >         remailer on their system... I will.  Additionally, you implicitly
  >         accept all the risks associated with trusting somebody elses
  >         machine.

After a rash of abuses, I received a polite notification from NETCOM that
it is now their policy to prohibit the running of remailers out of user
accounts, and a request to close down my remailer.

  >Therefore, you are hereby directed to disable your anonymous
  >remailer immediately.

That particular sentence may sound harsh, but it was set in very civil
message.  I just think they wanted me to get the point.

The catalyst remailer has been shut down.  While NETCOMs policy prohibits
remailers, it will not open again on NETCOM hardware.
