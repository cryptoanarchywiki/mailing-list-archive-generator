But she doesn't demonstrate the maniacal hatred for multiple
pseudonyms that LD did.  In fact, she's supporting them.

Someone sent the mail she mentions.  I think that it was an excellent
example of 'extreme go-away mail'.  It's not her fault that the person
who sent the most militant message of paranoia mentioned pmetzger.

I don't think the few mentions of him in what she has posted have
exceeded normal levels.

This sounds like what an average person would say if you showed them
messages saying things like 'the reason I like crypto is that it's a
hammer with which to smash the State.'  She doesn't sound like a
'tireless apologist and supporter'; she sounds like a non-anarchist.

She's telling the truth.  She's recognizing the reality that if a
couple of hundred people complain about her being LD, it's likely that
support@netcom is likely to terminate her account with extreme
prejudice, without listening to her insistence that she's not.

I don't think that's paranoid.  Do you?
