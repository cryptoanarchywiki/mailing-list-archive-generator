Anyone wants to flame me for cross-posting an article so soon after
whinging about everyone else doing it, feel free - I deserve it.
I thought a few of us would like to see it anyway though!  <duck & run...>

If it's a well simulated real market you might want to try some of
those tricks we were discussing some time ago to move money around...

                 MAMMON

   An Internet stock-picking "tournament"

MAMMON allows you to manage a virtual portfolio
in which you can buy and sell stocks at their
current market price.

You can view MAMMON as either a competition
to develop the most valuable portfolio (the
wealthiest accounts are available via the TOP
command), or as a way to test your stock
strategies, or merely as a way to record 
your investments.

*   New accounts get $100000 in play money

*   24 hours/day operation

*   It's free.  Just

                  telnet mammon.media.mit.edu 10900

Try it.
