Fact is, most people never think about real security.

Safe manufacturers have said that improvements in safes (the metal
kind) were driven by insurance rates. A direct incentive to spend more
money to improve security (cost of better safe < cost of higher
insurance rate).

Right now there is almost no economic incentive for people to worry
about PIN security, about protecting their files, etc. (Banks eat the
costs and pass them on...any bank which tried to save a few bucks in
losses by requiring 10-digit PINs--which people would *write down*
anyway!--would lose customers. Holograms and pictures on bank cards
are happening because the costs have dropped enough.)

Personally, my main interests is in ensuring the Feds don't tell me I
can't have as much security as I want to buy. I don't share the
concern quoted above that we have to find ways to give other people
security.

(And to think people call me an elitist!)
