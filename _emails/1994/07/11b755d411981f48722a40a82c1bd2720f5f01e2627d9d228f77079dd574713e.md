Sorry about forwarding this long message but I thought it would be 
something interesting to read. I have no idea if anyone has seen this 
before.. But this so you know what is currently happening now.
FYI, who ever made this post is not known at this time. Jeremy Cooper 
sent it to me and he must have found it on a mailing list for his class. 
The person who found it got it off the NirvanaNet. I e-mailed him and he 
thought it was joke. I then looked a bit closer and found that the earliest 
forwarder of this Chuck Zeps, who posted it on the USENET... Anyway the 
message he sent me is at the end of this message. If anyone has any ideas 
or comments about it, please send them. There are BBS numbers from the 
mailer taglines used by local BBSes. I'm sure if I give one of them a 
call I can figure out who wrote it originally....
Happy reading!!!

========================================================================
As someone involved in the telephone industry on the level of security
and data integrity... I would like to inform everyone that uses modems
and/or are bbs operators of some information.

The first thing that everyone that uses a modem should know is that
every time you fire up your modem your activating monitoring equipment
somewhere in the U.S.  I have worked for several large telephone
networks that routinely monitor and reroute modem and fax transmissions
through devices that allow them to view what is being transmitted and
even decodes encrypted data and fax packets used by major corporations
and governmental agencies.  This is allowed under the heading of
"Maintenance Monitoring" and may be continued for up to 6 months without
the need of any legal paperwork being generated.  Under an obscure
pre-WWII ruling by the agency that is now the FCC... "No information may
be encoded or transmitted over PUBLIC or PRIVATE forms of telephony or
radio with the exception of those agencies involved in the National
Security" a further designation goes on to say "with the exception of
the MORSE system of 'transmittal', any communication that is not
interpretable by the human ear is forbidden and unlawful."  The
information gathered goes to 3 seperate database facilities...1 is
codenamed Diana and is located in Brussels, the 2nd is named Fredrick
and is located somewhere in Malaysia, the 3rd is named Elizabeth and is
located in Boulder, Colorado.  The information stored in these systems
is accessable by the US Government, Interpol, Scotland Yard and various
other such agencies.  Your credit rating is also affected by your modem
usage... if you ever get a copy of your credit history and find a
listing that has HN06443 <--= this is a negative risk rating. or a code
87AT4 <---= an even more negative risk rating.... these will usually
have no description on them... and if you inquire about them they will
tell you that it just comes from the system that way. I am currently
working for another major carrier as a consultant and have been able to
watch these systems operate...at one unnamed long distance carrier here
in Columbus Ohio in their NCC, Network Control Center, you can see
several rows of computer terminals which have approximately 30 to 40
separate windows in each... these windows have data transmissions that
are being monitored... banks of 9 track tapes are going constantly to
record everything.  Everyone should realize that even if a sysop posts a
disclaimer at the beginning of his bbs about no access to governmental
agencies or law enforcement...that it isn't worth the time it takes to
type it in... looking forward to hearing reactions to this.

Aaron, the "telco" post was a repost of data I got from an import of
stuff from the Atlanta area. I regretfuly removed the header data and
most people thought *I* wrote it when I reposted it. It was posted to
another bbs down there ( data for that one is just above my .sig if you
look ).

The post was interesting as the methods used are substancially correct
and this type of thing does occur up here. I dunno about banks of
monitors for *everything* in real-time, but much targeted traffic can be
viewed that way ( HP data monitors hooked to archival taping decks).

You might call the BBS listed and enquire further if curious ...




                                     Regards, Chuck
