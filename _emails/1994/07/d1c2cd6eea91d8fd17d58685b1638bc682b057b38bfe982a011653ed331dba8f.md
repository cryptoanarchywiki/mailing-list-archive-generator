This is precisely what I like about cypherpunks.  I came up with an urge to
write a simple crypto split beast, and in posting it and publishing it, I
have caused others to polish up their old code, and post up far better
software. :-)

I love this list. :-)  Whoever said that cypherpunks don't write code was a
fool. :-)
