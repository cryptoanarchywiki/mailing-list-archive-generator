C'punks,

On the noon news in San Francisco, there was an item of crypto
interest.  It was about something I think they called the "Code
Grabber."  It is a device which receives and records the coded
RF signals used to remotely unlock car and garage doors.

The hand-held unit is a little larger than a paperback book.  It
has a half dozen switches on it.  After you intercept someone's
code, you can play it back anytime to control that person's car
lock or garage door.  It's kind of like a TV universal remote.

Some politicos have already started talking about banning it, but
I think just the publicity will guarantee a healthy black market
in such devices.  The public will be clamoring for a solution.
Enter the Cypherpunks.

How can this nifty burglary tool be outsmarted?  How about a
replacement system that uses strong crypto?  The Code Grabber
represents a great opportunity for an inventive Cypherpunk to
make some money AND promote crypto awareness.

The questions are:  Could standard auto and garage door openers
easily be retrofitted?  Could a "crypto remote" with its own CPU
be made small enough to fit into a hand-held unit?  Could such a
system be made for a reasonable cost?


 S a n d y

P.S.  I bet there are some other interesting uses to which such a
      device could put.  Any ideas?
