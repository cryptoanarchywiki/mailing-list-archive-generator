"....maybe I should leave. You guys seem a little too paranoid for my tastes."
.........................................................

It's not paranoia, it's just that LD is always trying to induce the 
list members into self-incrimination:  he intends to evoke 
crowd-gathering behavior wherein they will all betray their true 
nature, true motives, true attitudes.  He doesn't believe that they 
deserve as much credit as they seem to give themselves and wants to 
reveal to them, by their actual responses, what they would deny in 
public.  He doesn't think that they have all that much respect for 
privacy, but are only opportunists bent on only their own advantage, 
rather than supporting the principle of privacy per se (even for their 
enemies, who could as well use the available methods against them).

Everyone always knows what his true aims are, though, and no one    
ever   gives him any slack.
