Happy Birthday USA.
 
On your 218th birthday, you should be proud of yourself. As a leading
power in the world, you're certainly leading by example.
 
Once upon a time, you were a shining example of truth, hope and diligence.
Now you've become a vision of deception, state-rule and 21st century
socialism.
 
The United States Government's vision of Digital Telephony and
Skipjack powers are historical, yet laughable.
 
P.T. Barnum would be amazed.
 
Your fear of the digital future is real -- it cannot be controlled by
governments, corporate mongerers, nor super-secretive organized
intelligensia.The digital landscape cannot be shaped or legislated; the
thought is mere folly.
 
Happy Birthday USA.
