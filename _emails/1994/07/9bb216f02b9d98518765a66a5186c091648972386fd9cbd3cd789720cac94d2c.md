   Implying of course that it's clear to him.

  I'm glad you liked it. Atleast you kept the best line.

  Meaning that the answer I supplied to Sandy's question was the wrong
one. If he knows it's wrong, then he must know the correct answer,
well what is it? Otherwise, I'm waiting for a retraction.

for 3 nights: "What is the sound of one hand clapping?">

   Uh oh, do I detect a change of subject? You see, my last post was
directed to supply an answer to Sandy's question "Isn't it clear to
everyone what I'm making fun of?" (my answer, the campiness of the
show) with an added commentary on assuming a receptive audiencce. All
of a sudden, we have a diversion here into how Sandy's H.E.A.T. posts
on a mailing list compare to my brother-in-law's showing of vacation
pictures during a break at work which is irrelevent to the original
line of questioning (if you could call "Heh. It isn't clear to Ray."
questioning or discussion) A well timed change of subject, and a
barely subtle attempt to bait me of course.

   I'm not going to fall into the trap, so I won't bother responding. I'm
still waiting for your answer to Sandy's question, oh great oracle.

  You shouldn't think out loud. But your reflections on your own 
behavior are quite on the mark.

  Really Lefty, isn't it about time you stopped baiting people?
Scan the last twenty messages you posted to cypherpunks. At best,
they were nothing but a bunch "witty" 3-liners designed to start
a flame with somebody you thought you could obviously outwit. Almost
zero discussion or information content. The only post of yours
which contained atleast five full sentences was a forward of some
Sue D. Nym message. I'm honored that you respect my intellect enough
to dedicate more than your usual quota of 3 short sentences (I know
it must be quite taxing on your creativity), but maybe it's time for you 
to take a vacation.
