I just noticed the scheduled delivery/installation/completion of a
7400-Cray equivalents machine in around 1997:

Note also that poor Seymour Cray's Cray-3 (from Cray Computer, *not*
Cray Research, as you all must surely know) is not very competitive
with the various hypercubes and other parallel machines (like Intel's
Paragon and Thinking Machine's CM-5, both closely matched at around
90-100 Cray equivalents). I think this means the end of mostly
uniprocessor machines, even if made out of GaAs.

But the "NSA SMPP-2/2M" is intriguing. Speculatively (_very_), I
wonder if this is the "million processor" (or 2 million, if that's
what the "2M" means) machine researchers have talked about. (Danny
Hillis said at Hackers '90 that he hoped to see this built.)

I wonder who the contractor is?

Food for thought.

(And just what will the NSA SMPP-2/2M use for its food?)
