Hmm. Maybe I should rejoin the cypherpunks list, after all..

It does. But only if the user hasn't set a password. That's why I implemented
the password feature! I have also zapped all queued-up "tuna" messages.

But the whole current server is getting to be a horrible patchwork. I am
working on a total redesign/rewrite, as well as upgrading the machine and
the connection, to eliminate the delays and allow PGP. But to do all that,
I am going to need sponsors/support. Preliminary discussions started
with a couple of organisations.
