The forwards were crypto related and relevant to some of the members who
don't have anything other than e-mail accounts. How do you propose these
folks get this info?

Also how about those folks who have a low latency system and the posts
in various medium to high traffic systems gets flushed regularly. These
posts were several days old and I suspect in many systems were ready to
flush (they were on mine, I 'tripped' over them doing maintenance for
something else) to the bit bucket.

And do you seriously propose that I or any other member ask prior to 
submissions? It is really funny that in general I get a few more thanks
for such posts than self-interested rebuttals like this.

While it is true that some of my questions are off the wall, I will 
continue to ask them. If they bother then .kill me. As an aside to this
I will continue to remail articles of technical interest (what c-punks
is about last I heard anything) that I feel have a good case of being
lost. 

I would also like to ask a question on a personal (no flame intended) 
nature. Were you going to post said message about these usenet submissions?
Other than myself I see very few such re-posts from anything other than
a newsgroup w/ 'crypt' in it somehow.

The flame ware, as I understand it anyway, had to do with forwarding 
multiple copies of EFF and similar material which is minimaly related
to cyrypto and most users actively look for it. I doubt a lot of the 
users here check out sci.math, sci.chaos, sci.neural-nets, etc. 

If we are really going to continue this thread then a serious discussion
relating to c-punks and some form of submission standard needs to be agreed
upon.
