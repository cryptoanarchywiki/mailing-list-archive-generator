	[1] Simply because you don't read new software announcements 
every day doesn't mean people aren't writing code. I am, for one, but 
people have other jobs and responsities to take care of.

	[2] Less than a week after a small flame war about forwarding, 
and a suggestion that it be restricted to posting pointers to relevant 
info, Jim forwards over 65K of relevant, though specialized information 
that no-one had requested. Simply saying "There's some real informative 
posts about RNGs in sci.math, thread name "XXX"" have been helpful, 
faster, saved bandwidth and people's mailboxes, and not started up this 
flame war.
