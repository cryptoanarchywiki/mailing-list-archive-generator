I think you might be able to do a lookup scheme more cheaply on CPUs
that really have such an extreme CPU/memory speed ratio.

You can encode the lookup table as an array of 4-bit values (you
*could* do 3-bits, but that'd make the table lookup a lot
messier). You can also add the trick of checking one bit of each byte
explicitly, and thus you could fit the entire table in 64 bytes.
That's probably just two-four cache lines, so access to the table
would become much less bad than 1/200th the register access time.

It'd be something like this:

	bits = 0;
	For each byte:
		if (byte != 0)
			index = byte >> 1;
			shift = (index & 1) << 2;
			bits = ((tbl[index] >> shift) & 0x0f) +
					(byte & 1) +
					1;

Hmm...  That's probably about a dozen instructions per byte, or about
50 instructions for a 32-bit word.  The per-bit loops seem to be
around 100 instructions long.  If we've got a better than 12-1 speed
ration (CPU vs. memory), which is quite possible on a CPU with a
decent cache design, then I'd say the table lookup wins.

(Does this count towards my "cypherpunks write code" merit badge?)
