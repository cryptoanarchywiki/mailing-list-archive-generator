From the July 11 _Fortune_ magazine, in an article about "25 cool companies":

     The battle over how to ensure the privacy and security of
     communication in cyberspace pits the spy masters at the National
     Security Agency, with thousands of people and a budget said to be in
     excess of $10 billion a year, against a small, privately held
     California company.  Nearly everyone in Silicon Valley seems to be
     rooting for the little guy.  RSA is a darling of libertarian hackers
     because it sells a way to keep digital exchanges indecipherable by
     unwanted eyes, including those of Big Brother.
                              . . .

Multiple authors, the RSA piece was by Alan Deutschman (deutschman@aol.com).
Interesting blurb, two quotes from Jim@RSA.  The article also covers Mosaic
Communications, Enterprise Integration Technologies, McAfee Assoc., Cisco
Systems, Infosafe, Scientific Computing Assoc., Security Dynamics, & others.

On another subject, does RIPEM interoperate with PGP or other public key 
software?  I have version 1.0.5 for DOS.  Thanks for any replies.
