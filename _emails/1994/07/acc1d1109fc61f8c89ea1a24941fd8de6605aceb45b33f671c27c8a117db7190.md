I'm glad you thought it was funny. :-)  At least someone besides myself did.
:-)  It was more for that "pro" look & feel than anything else.

However, I don't seem to have heard from any cypherpunk who felt it was out
of place to put "cypherpunks" on it rather than just you and Perry.  Okay,
so Tim did complain, but I don't take his complaint to be "Oh my god! You've
made me out to be an anarchist" ;-)  So if anyone does have a cow, would he or
she please let me know?  This has been a public service request. :-)

Actually as far as the PC Expo disks are concerned anyone whose articles
weren't on the disk, who didn't contribute anything, and is pissed has no
say in the matter, so I guess other than the few names that made it on the
disk...

But lets not look the obvious.  Perhaps some members of the "underground"
received that disk and were very happy with it?  Perhaps it turned some
anal folks over to the other side?  Anything is possible.  Still perhaps
there will be better materials for the next expo.   Personally I don't find
anything wrong with the transcript.  I enjoyed your speech, and you both
did a fine job at outlining the real legal and fuzzy uses for crypto and
that is a whole lot more honest that what's been spewing out of the NSA
and FBI.  Even if someone didn't agree with all the uses, after reading that
piece he certainly is at least aware of them.  Right?

The only other place it went was on the PC EXPO disk.  As for blaming the others
for your words, I'd say they should be proud of such blame, and if they object
why have I not heard from them yet?  Certainly I do not think that Tim
would object to being called a crypto-anarchist, other than Perry he's the only
one I've really heard complain about the copyright.

So then I did do well to place a "NOT FOR SALE" tag on the file.
