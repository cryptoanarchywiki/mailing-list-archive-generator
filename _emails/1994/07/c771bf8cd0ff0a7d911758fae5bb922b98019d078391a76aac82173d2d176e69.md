   I currently don't have any HPR motors, reloads or any such thing. I left 
them behind when I moved to Georgia (not knowing the legal climate down here). 
So I feel (relatively) safe putting forth my two cents worth as to what I would 
do. 
     First, I would be rigidly legal in every respect. In fact, after hearing 
about them worrying about casing residue I would make sure I didn't even have 
so much as a spent D12-0 casing. Anything I needed would be bought enroute to 
any launch meet, or at the meet itself. 
     Second, I would endeavor to be as 'safe' and 'peaceful' as possible. There 
would be no 'terminator 2' talk out of me.
     Third, if I did get attacked, everything would be 'yessir' and 'nossir'.
     Then, I would quietly go down to the federal courthouse and file a RICO 
Act lawsuit.
     RICO Act stands for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. 
This is what is commonly referred to as being charged with 'racketeering'. RICO 
allows individuals (as well as governments) to file against persons or 
organizations that commit three major offenses against one person or a major 
offense against three or more persons.
     One unique feature that makes it exceedingly lucrative for lawyers to take 
on contingency is that the awarded amount is TRIPLE the sum of all court costs, 
 out-of-pocket costs, compensatory, and punitive damages.
     Certain agencies may be immune but not all of them. Also, you could argue 
that immunity only applies to their lawfully empowered duties and when they 
exceed that authority, that they are acting outside of government protection 
and become private citizens commiting acts against other private citizens.
     There was a church in California in 1979 that began moving to do something 
like that against the state Attorney General (Dukemajian at the time). The 
state was trying to take over all of that church's operations (under a law 
protecting charitable trusts - like United Way) Ex-Parte on the claim from six 
ex-members that money was being absconded with. California tried to impose 
their own people into that church's ruling hierarchy & even declared in open 
court that all churches in California thereafter belonged to the state. The 
threatened suit plus the outrageously gross misapplication of the law spooked 
the California legislature into repealing that law completely over the violent 
protestations of Attorney General Dukemajian. I believe there was a book about 
this called "Against the Gates of Hell" or something by somebody named Rader.
