Well I've skimmed the paper because this is non-intuitive to me, and I'm
impressed by the level of security that Chaum requires from his protocols.
He treats the absolutely impossible and the computationally infeasible
seperately. Determining whether the coin is one of yours falls into the
second category. In order to determine whether you have used a coin
previously (in a maximally secure scheme) you need the bank's secret key.
So you just wind up your 4096 bit number factoring machine, dump in the
modulus, and presto, out come your factors from which you compute the
secret key.

Now I don't know about you, but if I had the bank's key, figuring out
if I've seen a digital coin before is NOT the first thing I would do.
