A swallow flew into a school classroom and wept for 10 minutes for 
the Great Leader. Then it prayed for 5 minutes, says North Korean Radio.
Three wild geese wailed and circled over a Kim Il Sung statue. Tri-coloured
clouds and rainbows have appeared to mourn Kim's death.

Meanwhile in Singapore housing societies, closed circuit TV cameras have been 
installed in elevators, connected to TV's in many apartments. Intended to
reduce the handful of people used to urinating in elevators, this will provide
some much needed entertainment to satellite-dish-less Singaporeans.

A letter in the Economist, replying to their story on the problem of too
much growth in Singapore, suggested that the root cause is the 'near-whiplash
speed of the escalators' that makes the citizens a scurrying lot.


Rishab, who's too bemused to laugh.
