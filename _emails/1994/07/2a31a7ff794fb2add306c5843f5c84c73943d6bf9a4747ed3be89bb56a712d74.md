Count this as a vote in favor of pointers to information instead of 
reposts, at least where the original is easily accessed by most folks.
The only time I find reproductions in toto useful is where the information
comes from private mail, obscure mailing lists, or other sources I can't
get.

Also, I thought some C-punks might be pleased to hear that PGP and
discussions of encryption/confidentiality are making their way into
the legal community - a law/computers list I'm on has recently had a
spurt of messages re confidentiality and attorney/client privilege, 
and every response so far has mentioned PGP in a positive light.
