A good RNG must pass all such tests. The idea of just one test is itself
dangerous. It would be a generous person who would collect such tests and
organize them to a common interface. Only then would you begin to have "one
test": the collection of these tests.

I coded a blum filter a few years ago which requires about 16,000 random
bits. I tried several prngs in various libraries, then implemented several
from literature including Knuth. All of these caused the filter to work at
about half efficiency. I could find no bugs in the filter code. Then I
recalled that there was a DES routine available. I used DES to generate the
random bits. The filter then worked close to the theoritical maximum!
