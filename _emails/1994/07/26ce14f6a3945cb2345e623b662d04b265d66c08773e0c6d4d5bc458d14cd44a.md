I've heard that an article appeared in the Dallas Morning News,
apparently yesterday (wednesday) on the absurdity of crypto export
controls.  I understand that I was quoted in reference to my CJ
requests for Bruce Schneier's book and floppy disk (which is not
surprising since the writer interviewed me last week). Does anybody
have a copy of this article?  I have no easy way of getting a copy.

Phil
