So that makes 2 things we agree on... :)

And I think that you are right about college. Mine have taken minor
changes (maybe that's because I haven't ever finished school), like
on crypto for instance (I admit it... used to lean to the anti-side),
but school choice does have greater significance than I think a lot
of people give it credit for.

I wasn't refering to you specifically, Tim. The folk on this
list for (well, the most part) are a lot more active than the
population at large (pat, pat). When I wrote that I was thinking
of this little enclave of folks that used to frequent several lists
that I was on and post enourmous tirades about how then the government
shriveled up and died of it own accord everything was gonna be
great and so on. Gimme a busy anarchist to an couch potato anything
any day...

As above, I should have been more careful about the insinuation.
Tim, Didn't know you did charity. ;)
