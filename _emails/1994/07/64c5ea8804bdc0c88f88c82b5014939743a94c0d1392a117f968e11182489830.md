Eric speaks of the two kinds of electronic money systems--
closed ones where crypto doesn't have to be done because the system
guarantees security, and open ones where crypto has to be used.

Right...I think.  What has to scale is the "semantics of money."
Within a small area ("box"), security is guaranteed by how the enclosing
system works, and over a larger area it's done by crypto (*).  But
for the programs, the difference is transparent, except for a cost
that resembles communications cost.

(*) There's also an issue of, "Can that box over there guarantee me
that I can run programs securely within it?"  There are ways to
do this with tamperproof boxes and such.  Or looser ways to do it
with reputations.
