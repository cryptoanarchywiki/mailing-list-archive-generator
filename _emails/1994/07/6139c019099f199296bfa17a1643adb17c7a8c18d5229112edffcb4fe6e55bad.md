I wasn't going to contribute to this, but Jim is apparently impervious to
reason unless _everyone_ on the list screams at him.

Don't forward reams of stuff available elsewhere to the list.  If you like,
mention where it is; offer to send copies to those who specifically request
it.

Don't post it to the list.

Add me to your "couple of dozen who scream".

On a more personal note, digging your heels in and sobbing "I won't, I
_won't_, I WON'T!" at the perfectly reasonable suggestions that have been
made to you make you seem like a puerile and self-centered preadolescent. 
Grow up.
