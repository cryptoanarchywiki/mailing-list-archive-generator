What about implementing a Multiplayer Game Protocol? That way,
you can play cards, checkers, chess, Life(TM), -  all those
games that used to be really popular circa precolor macintoshes.

begin.

Not that I know of, but this is both good and silly enough
that I might see if I can find some time. Need to bone back up
on real coding...
