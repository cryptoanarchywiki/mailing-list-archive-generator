Well, I've had this file in my ftp dir for awhile...
but I don't think anyone knew where to find it.  Since it's short, I hope
nobody will flame me for posting this.

It's a csh script...  I'm sure you can follow the general format and adapt
it.  You may need to replace 'queuemail' with 'sendmail' in the last line,
depending on your system.
