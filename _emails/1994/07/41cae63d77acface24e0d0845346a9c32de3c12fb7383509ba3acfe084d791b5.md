OOPS... I found it.  They are adding a way to have PGP automatically add 
some cleartext on ciphered messages....

"...A version for MSMail..... We intend to have a windows toolkit
version available by September.  With this windows version, we
can then start work on integration into the various mail
programs.  MSMail is on the list.  Stay tuned... check back with
us as to our progress.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free
to contact me.
