I subscribed to this when LD first announced it early last December. I never
received any mail. At that time I do believe Julf had said something supporting
this list. Incidentally the address for LD in your database on AOL is ancient.
And the description message seems watered down. The original post was full of
LD's paranoid gems -- here's an excerpt for your entertainment:

> anonymity. However, we do not necessarily believe that others are
> required to read anonymous postings. To the contrary, we believe that
> the individual should have the tools and freedom to filter his or her
> own mail based on real identities. In particular, we condemn the
> practice of `pseudospoofing,' the dangerous deception where a person
> builds up a pseudonym and misrepresents it as being that of a real
> person's identity. We police each other on the list to prevent it, and
> require a promise that our members refrain from it. While our trust can
> be betrayed, only those that are honest are true cypherwonks, and
> anyone who betrays our trust we consider a dishonist hypocrite, or worse, 
> a *traitor*

Note the Detweilerese: pseudospoofing, honest and true, hypocrite, *traitor*.
