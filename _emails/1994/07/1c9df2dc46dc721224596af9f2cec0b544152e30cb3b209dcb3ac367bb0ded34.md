I don't see what "key escrow" is good for besides enabling wiretaps.  Am I
missing something here?

In any public-key system, even one without "key escrow", I know (or could
easily discover if I wanted to) my own private key.  Yes, I may want to make
some kind of "backup" arrangements for my key, to cover forgetfulness, death,
or whatever.  But that doesn't require anything in the communication/storage
formats (e.g., no LEAF field).  The managment of my private key is independent
of communication/storage of encrypted material.

"Key escrow", on the other hand, is about building into the
communication/storage formats a requirement that I use only keys that are
"escrowed".  I don't see what this adds, other than a requirement that my
communication/storage be interceptable with the cooperation of my "escrow
agents".
