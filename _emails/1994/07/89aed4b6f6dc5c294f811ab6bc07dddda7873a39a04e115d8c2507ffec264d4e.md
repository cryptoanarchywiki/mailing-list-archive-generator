The advantage of expatriation.  If you are in a country other than that of
your birth there is less of a psychological burden.  The government is just
another thing to deal with.  No magic associations from childhood.  This is
particularly true if you move around.  Dual nationality helps too.  You can
buy same for <$25K  from various Carribean nations.
