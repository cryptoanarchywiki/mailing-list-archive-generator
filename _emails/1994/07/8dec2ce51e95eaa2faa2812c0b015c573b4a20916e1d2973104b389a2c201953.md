I tried out America OnLine last night (free disk in the mail) and saw that they
had support for gopher -- so I poked around and found the CPSR site --
and from that, the pub/cypherpunks directory.

However, there was no pgp directory and no code in the cypherpunks
directory.

Does anyone know if this is manipulation by AOL or some side effect of gopher?
(I'm new to both AOL and gopher).
