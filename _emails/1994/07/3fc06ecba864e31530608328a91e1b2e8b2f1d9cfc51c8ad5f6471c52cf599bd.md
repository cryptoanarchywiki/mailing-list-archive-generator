That makes sense, and I don't see it as being too much of a problem either. 
Physical cash works that way too; if I write down the serial numbers of all
money that goes through my hands, then if it ever comes back into my hands
I'm going to recognize it. It would be nice if ecash could not have this
"flaw", but it doesn't seem vital, or even particularly important, to me.
