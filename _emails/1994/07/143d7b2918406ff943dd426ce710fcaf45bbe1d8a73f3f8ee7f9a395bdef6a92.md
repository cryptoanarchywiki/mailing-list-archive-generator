I know I'll regret this, but...
I've seen a lot of comments by folks that indicates a high level of
mathematical sofistication.  So I'm curious.

Please e-mail me as follows:

SUBJECT: algebra1            If you've had semester course on algebra.
SUBJECT: algebra2            If you've had a year-long senior level course
                               based on Fraliegh or some such.
SUBJECT: grad                If you've been to grad school in math.
SUBJECT: firstcourse         If you've had the prelim algebra course. 
                                     (Hungerford or such)
SUBJECT: prelim              If you've passed your algebra prelim.
