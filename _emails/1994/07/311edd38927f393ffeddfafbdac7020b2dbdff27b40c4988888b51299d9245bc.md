Last Sunday's Times (of London) had a cover story in the color supplement
entitled "Lost in Cyberspace" by Stephen Amidon about the fact that you
can't censor same.  Included history of film and video censorship in the UK.
Sober.  No mention of TDPs (Terrorists, Drug-dealers, Pederasts).  Said
governments and major corporations were worried.  Mentioned virtual sex.
Suggested we try giving people other interests rather than censoring their
inputs (since we can't anyway.

"If you think that those people are worthy or capable of ruling you then
you're probably right."
