There's an outfit called NetBank, which is selling e-cash-like *certificate
numbers*, through a dial-up BBS on a 900 line, in any denomination you
want, which you can e-mail to vendors to buy stuff with. In fact all the
interactions with the bank (deposits, breaking "bills" into smaller
denominations, etc.) are done with switch codes in e-mail.

It's extremely ungainly, and it looks userous too, to the extent that they
charge 20% (each way?) to cash you in and out.  I hoovered out all the
stuff in their infobot (netbank-info@agents.com), and I really haven't
plowed through it all yet. If you folks are interested I'll summarize it
for the group and/or redirect my dumpster-divings on the subject to you
individually in e-mail. Just let me know. 'Course you're welcome to play
with their infobot yourselves, I suppose ;-).

It looks like someone did some serious work on this, folks. That's just a
philosophy major from Missouri talking, of course.  I wonder who they are?
I heard some discussion about them here, but I can't seem to find the
thread in my e$ article stash....

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
