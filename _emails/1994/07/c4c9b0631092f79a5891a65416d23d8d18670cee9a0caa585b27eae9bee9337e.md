Dr. Elizebeth Morgan, I suspect. 
(Dual MD couple in DC. She accuses him of child molestation, spirits
daughter away. Refused to tell Judge where. In lockup for ~1.5 years
without charge/trial. Congress finally passed a law limiting civil
contempt to release her. More recently, Supreme Court ruling defining
limits of civil contempt (UMW vs. JOHN L. BAGWELL) may have an effect on
this.)
