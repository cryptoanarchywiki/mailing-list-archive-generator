  There's some pretty good bits of government abuse of wiretaps in
Arnold's newest mega-blockbuster, _True Lies_. (big abuses of
wiretaps really)  Apparently the terrorists in this movie must
use clipper because the "Omega Sector" (the government superspy
agency in the movie) decrypts some of the terrorist's files in
a matter of minutes. Probably just another bit of Cameron's humor,
because the movie is loaded with unlikely events which are hilarious.
