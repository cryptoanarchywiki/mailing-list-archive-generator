I remember my crypto professor going over this as part of the last week of our
crypto class.  Somehow, there was a snag using RSA, and if I remember correctly
he used a model where both sides share the same N value.  He ran across some
P and Q prime values where this didn't work, but with a shared modulus for
both players, it did work.

Bruce Schneier's book didn't mention this snag, so either that was an error,
or there's something else we overlooked durring the simulation.  (This was a
blackboard simulation, not a computer simulation, but it failed with some
small numners... :-)

Anyway, you can ask him about it, his address is rvslyke@prism.poly.edu
