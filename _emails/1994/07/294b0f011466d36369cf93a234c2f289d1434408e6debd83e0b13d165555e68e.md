This week's "Time" has a cover story on Internet and we're in it.

"Spooks vs. Cypherpunks

There is a group of hackers who
believe that powerful encryption
will set them free.  Government
spooks don't mind if these so-
called cypherpunks use codes to
lock up secrets, so long as the
spooks hold the back-door key."
