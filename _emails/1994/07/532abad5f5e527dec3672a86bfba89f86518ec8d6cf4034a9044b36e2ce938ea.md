Go back in your archives and notice that this responce reitterates one
I had made earlier about not seeing such references unless they  came
from a newsgroup with crypt  in it somehow.

I didn't lash out at anyone. I posted a set of materials I thought some
might find interesting. If folks like you had left it alone that would
have been the end of it. I would not have made any further communications
on it. However, a certain clique of c-punks seem compelled to reply to
every damn post that gets sent on there, and do it ad nauseum. If the 
traffic is too high try not replying unless it is a positive contribution.
But, because you folks apparently have nothing  better to do  we have 
managed to generate a set of list traffic that vastly exceeds the original
forwards.

Reminds me of the years I worked in a science museum and people were always
coming around with new projects for me to  do. My general responce became   to
point them to the shop and tell them to have at. I have little respect for
people who have nothing better to do than tell others how to spend their time.
If the suggestion is that great, carry it out yourself.

I didn't condem the list or anyone else for that matter.

I *NEVER* said that or anything like it. Geesh, speaking of imagination.
