There is some sample data included in the appendix to the IDEA
description (chapter 3 or someone's thesis) which is floating around
the network.  This sample data should allow at least a partial
validation of your cipher implementation, and arbitrary amounts of
it can furthermore be generated by using the sample C implementation
contained in the same appendix.

This document is widely available, but until the end of the week I have
stored it in:

	ftp.mq.edu.au:/home/ifarqhar/idea-eurocrypt90.zip

I do not know how much longer it will remain after Friday, as I will be
leaving my position here on that day and moving accounts.
