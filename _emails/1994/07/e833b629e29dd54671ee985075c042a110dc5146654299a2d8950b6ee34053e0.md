How about if the dealer sends out the hash of the original deck, then 
each player sends back a permutation(first a hash, for disclosure and 
commitment, then the open value).  The permutations are then applied 
to the deck as shuffled by the dealer, distroying his order.  The 
"goodness" of the original shuffle would allow security from colusion 
among all the players, and the presence of any one good permutation will 
shuffle the deck.
