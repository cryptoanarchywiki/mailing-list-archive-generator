<stuff about Mankato State U. requiring that all students use a new 
PhotoID card deleted>

	Personally, I don't think I have any real problem with it.  Unlike a 
government approach, you still retain some level of choice -- i.e. if 
you don't like Mankato's ability to track you through this card, don't 
go to Mankato, or perhaps more realistically, minimize usage of the 
card.  This seems kind of similar to the arguments about a company's 
right to use escrowed keys.  There is no reason why a company can't 
mandate that all use escrowed keys for employees conducting company 
business (email, transactions, etc.).  If the company is regularly 
using its keys to examine your mail and it pisses you off, quit and 
work for a different company that treats its employees with more 
respect.  In any case, choice is preserved.
