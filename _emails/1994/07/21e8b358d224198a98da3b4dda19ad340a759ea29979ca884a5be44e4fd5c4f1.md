Call it a hunch.

I didn't say I knew of any such attacks.  In fact, I used to believe that
such are completely impossible (and may yet come back to that belief), but
for the moment, I'm entertaining the notion of such attacks and seeing
where that leads me.  If there were such attacks, they would rely on
information about the key leaking into the ciphertext, independent of the
plaintext.  It might be possible to prove that any key-driven permutation
(1:1 mapping) can not allow such attacks, but I haven't composed such a
proof yet.
