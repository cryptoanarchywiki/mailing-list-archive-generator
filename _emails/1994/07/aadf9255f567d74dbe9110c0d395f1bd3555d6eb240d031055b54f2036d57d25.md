Tim actually did just that when he posted his pointer.

IMHO a more serious and prevalent problem is the onslaught of spam
whenever EFF, CPSR, EPIC, NSA, or EIEIO issue press releases even
tangentially related to crypto. Not only do I usually get a copy in my
main inbox (since my filter doesn't catch it because it's not via
toad.com), there are always some helpful folks who forward it verbatim
without checking the list first. There are even a few hardcore
crossposters who will post the same article _multiple_ times when they
don't see the first one appear instantly.
