It is indeed a problem. I hear that grady@netcom.com recently posted some
useful info on this matter somewhere on UseNet, but I can't find it. I recall
having found an interesting article sometime last year, but I lost it. In
short, it said that pass phrases and such should be "shocking nonsense". The
"shocking" element will help you remember it, and the "nonsense" element will
make it difficult for others to guess it.

My pass phrase is a couple of words long and contains deliberate misspellings
and unusual capitalization. To be able to remember it, I simply use PGP every
day, even if there's nothing to sign or decrypt. ;-)

I'm a (long time) 2-finger typist but I have no problems with echo off.

CU,  Sico.
