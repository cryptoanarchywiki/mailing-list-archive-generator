I was curious about the pros and cons of anonymous remailers holding and 
randomly sending outgoing mail.  It seems to me that the risk of a third 
party determining the original sender of an anonymous piece of mail through 
the use of timestamps is less pressing than the risk presented by the 
physical storage of that mail on someone's machine for extended periods of time.

Of course, with chained remailing, these risks dramatically decrease, but 
would I rather have the first remailer in a chain storing my mail until 
midnight or immediately bouncing it to another anonymous remailer?
