The secret key is _encrypted_ with the passphrase. Strength of PGP with a
known secret keyFILE, not key, and unknown passphrase, is the strength of the
cipher used to encrypt the secret key with. In this case, the strength of IDEA.
Of course, your pass phrase is as susceptible to dictionary attack as your UNIX
password, and it would be easier to decrypt a message by decrypting through 
such attacks or brute force your keyfile, than to factor large numbers to get 
at your session key.

RSA would have a tough time using a 11 char English phrase as an exponent ;-)

To quote from the PGP manual:

     PGP also asks for a "pass phrase" to protect your secret key in case
     it falls into the wrong hands.  
     Nobody can use your secret key file without this pass phrase.       
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ps. as Tim correctly said, Jains don't like killing living things. They are 
Jains, not Jainists (followers of some hypothetical Mr. Jain?); the word comes 
from the Sanskrit for 'to overcome'.
