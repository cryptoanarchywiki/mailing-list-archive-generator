I don't see any defense in this description against using someone
else's public key.  The feds could still decrypt such messages,
but wouldn't know who was talking.  At least not from the envelope.
This could defeat casual mass traffic analysis by agencies who have
the private keys, because they'd have to look inside the messages for
identity cues.  It could also defeat *all* traffic analysis by
parties who don't have the private keys.  That would make it
preferable to Clipper.

Or does the proposed system also have some authentication component?
