This seems like an appropriate time to give a plug to the Extropians list 
software.  If I remember correctly, there was a ::nosend command that 
people could use when forwarding long messages.  The ::nosend command
would cause the list processor to file the whole message in the archives, 
and only send out a pointer to it (a title in the index?).  Those who 
wanted to retrieve the message could send a command to the list 
processor, requesting it.

I don't know if Majordomo has anything similar...
