That would be rather easy to acomplish with a secret algorithm. Still
possible, but not quite as easy with a published one. I am sure it will be
done.

I think this is the real problem that awaits us. While I do not believe
that society is quite ready for it to be broadly deployed, I think that it
inevitably will happen. First to monitor conviced criminals (to make sure
that rapist really stays away from schools), then children (in case they
get abduced), soon afterwards everyone else. And you know what? The public
will _ask_ for it.

Picture of happy shopper. "Citibank transducer (TM). Now nobody can use my
account without my knowledge and best of all -- I don't have to remember to
bring a card. I can't understand why not everyone is doing it." Jingle.
