 No, no.  You've got it all wrong. Perry is really the brother of Tom
Metzger, publisher of W.A.R. or White Aryan Resistance. The whole
organization is financed by Tim May and Perry is the W.A.R. liaison
to Tim. They use cryptography to avoid FBI investigation of their
organization. Detweiler is really a federal agent. His idiocy
is really a cover for his crisp deductive ability which he uses
to investigate people on cypherpunks.

  Proof of Tim May's racism is his use of the word "black" in
his blacknet essay. Why not whitenet? Tim has also been caught
attacking the government's AFDC program and we all know that's a sure
sign of racism. Finally, if you're not convinced, look at Tim's
pseudonym, "Klaus von Future Prime" That's proof of his
pro-german-nazi attitude.

  I'm sending this message to you privately because if it ever
got out that I told you all this, Tim May would take out a contract
on my life. Hitnet really exists; Tim's satires on it are merely
a cover just like the War of the Worlds broadcast!
