Suppose we have a spatial transform performed by light flowing
through a grid.  Is that an algorithm?   Perhaps it is, but I
am about to describe a case that will stretch your definition
of algorithm rather more drastically.

True.

Suppose our quantum system has thirty two bytes.

Then a classical simulation of our quantum system would require
2^257 words of memory

The computer would require more matter than exists in the universe.

Each step of the simulation would require 2^514 steps by the computer,
which even for a computer constructed of very tiny components out
of all the matter in the universe would still require vastly longer
than the entire lifetime of the univers.

It does not sound like a very useful algorithm, nor is it one
that is easy to describe.

The difference is like the difference in my example of light
flowing through a grid, as against a fourier transform etc,
but the difference is enormously greater.

You say it makes no difference by definition.  I say such
definitions are misleading when we discuss how problems are
to be solved.
