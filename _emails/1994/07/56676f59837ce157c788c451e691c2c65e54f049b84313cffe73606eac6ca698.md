Exactly what I fear most from this case.  In order to assist users, sysops  
may be required to rate and/or categorize all downloadable material using  
a rating scale or list of categories determined by some governing body  
(FCC?).  If the sysops do not following the guidelines, then they can be  
considered participants in the distribution of "bad stuff" to "good  
places".

I think "At worst" is not very likely, for the reasons you state.  That's  
why I worry more about "At best".

I think the only real good outcome would be that the verdict is overturned  
because of some technicality, preventing the case from becoming some kind  
of landmark.  However, this would only delay things until the next case.
