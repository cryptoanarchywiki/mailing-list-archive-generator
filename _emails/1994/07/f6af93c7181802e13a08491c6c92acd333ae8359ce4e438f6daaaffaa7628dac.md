NIST has agreed to license Micali's key escrow patents.  I posted their
press release in talk.politics.crypto and alt.privacy.clipper.  The
settlement is evidently open-ended; there's an article in Cyberwire
Dispatch (whatever that is -- a copy was forwarded to me) that discusses
the ramifications in some detail.
