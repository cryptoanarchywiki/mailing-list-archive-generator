Seeing how he is so fit for the job, and knows not only what we
all need to see, but also what the bottem line is, I hereby nominate
Jim for CypherGod, and urge him to, as his first action in that
role, to pipe all of usenet through cypherpunks, because you Just
Never Know when you might miss something that is crypto related,
and after all, if you want to be crypto-savvy, you have to pay a
little.
