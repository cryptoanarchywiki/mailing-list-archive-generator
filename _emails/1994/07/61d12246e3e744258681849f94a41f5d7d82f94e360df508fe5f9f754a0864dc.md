If your passphrase is good (128+ bits of entropy), then your private key is
as secure as the messages that you send. Although it need be broaken only
once, I see no real danger of IDEA being compromised in the near future.
Given a good passphrase, I would suggest that you want multiple coppies of
your key to prevent loss or accidental destruction. My passphrase is > 30
characters. Fortunately Mac PGP remembers the key during any given session
so typing is kept down a bit.
