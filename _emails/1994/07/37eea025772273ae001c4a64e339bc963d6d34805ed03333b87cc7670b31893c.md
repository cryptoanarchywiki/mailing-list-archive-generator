It has been brought up on the Cypherpunks mailing list that Microsoft is
proposing to include public-key escrow as a *built-in* "function" of future
products - Chicago and Daytona have been specifically mentioned.
...................................................................... 
..........

No, this is not correct.  It was speculation from Tim May on possible 
developments, based on his interpretation of recent events and on email 
which I sent to him.  This email was referring to the fact that his 
concerns notwithstanding,  it is not an easy thing to implement a 
privately-held key escrow system into a desktop operating system, that 
Microsoft is not talking about implementing a 'software Clipper', and 
is presently only *examining* the international ramifications of 
software key-escrow and non-escrowed strong encryption security.

Please give it this question the benefit of the doubt and postpone your 
conclusions about this until I can get an official statement, thanks.
