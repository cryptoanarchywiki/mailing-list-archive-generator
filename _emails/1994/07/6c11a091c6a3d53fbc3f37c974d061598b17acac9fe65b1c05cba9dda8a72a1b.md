Some comments on Duncan's post:

All of the arguments which he proposes against reasons why the 
government can't succeed are true and accurate; however, it is one of 
those things where "you know and I know, but *they* don't know"......

The examples which you relate of government failures from inefficiency, 
etc. have been proven time and again in history, but in that case why 
does history keep repeating itself, in slightly different variations.

"......why doesn't Clinton impose wage and price controls, exchange controls,
tariffs, and a full-blown industrial policy?"

If he can succeed in implementing the Health Plan, and if the National 
ID were accepted, that would probably next on his agenda (if he were to 
be re-elected  [2 more years]).
One saving grace from all the discussions which are going on of the 
above projects is that they presently are just discussions, and if they 
could just be kept discussing these things, none of them will ever be 
accomplished.  By the time the discussions are finished, everyone will 
have version 10.x of every computer app and all companies will be "virtual".
