I can think of a couple reasons to want other people to be more secure.

1) The more people protect their privacy, the less profit there is in
privacy invasion, so that there will be fewer people doing it and
the techniques and infrastructure of spying might develop more 
slowly.

2) The more people protect their privacy, the less privacy afficionados
will stand out from the crowd.

3) The more people buy privacy, the more developed the market for
privacy techniques and services, and the more private ways of doing
things will be available and easy to use.
