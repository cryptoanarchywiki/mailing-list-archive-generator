Especially given that urban folklore about everyone being only 5 hops away
on the network of life. I.e. Everyone is a friend of a friend of a friend of
a friend of a friend of anyone else. This was sort of troped upon in "6 degrees
of Separation", the John Guare movie/play. 

If anyone had any concrete data about this, then it might be interesting to 
calculate the optimum number of people you should get to cosign your public
key. 
Anyone remember enough about Ramsey numbers and Graph Theory?
