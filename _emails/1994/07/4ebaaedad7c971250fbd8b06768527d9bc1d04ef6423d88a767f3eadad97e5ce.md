about the credit card transactions.  i was stupid and lost the one reply
that showed interest.  but the data i have is for one network only.
it's TeleMoney, run by Ceridian (used to be Control Data), and there's
no encryption on the transaction at all.

the information would end up pretty long, and i don't want to bomb this
list.  interested people should send me mail instead.  include a pgp
public key.

to get mail to me, use remailer@rebma.mn.org and include the following
