Blanc,

While your conversation with LD may be too much for the whole list (I for
one have been ambushed by this sudden spurt in activity) as his posts are
rarely less than 15k, I'd request you to archive them, so that they can
be added to The Detweiler Files, available on ftp from someplace on Robert
Hayden's site.

They should be interesting. After all, students of information society unable
to find a topic for their theses can always choose The Proliferation Of 
Pseudospoofing Tentacles, or The Sniffer Of Medusas. 

Seriously.
