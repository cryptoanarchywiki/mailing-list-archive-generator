The information superhighway, and the freedom of America, is
threatened by a couple of government employees looking at dirty
pictures. PRI's (formerly APRs) oh-so-statist "business" news radio
program "Marketplace" had a story on this last night. Naturally, they
had on the LA reporter who uncovered the shocking fact that some
American's like looking at pictures of naked people having sex, and
that the internet can be used for this purpose as well as paper
magazines. Naturally, said reporter was shocked and just HAD to tell
the bosses of the perpetrators of this horrible crime against
humanity.  Naturally, the word "pedophilia" arose in the discussion.
