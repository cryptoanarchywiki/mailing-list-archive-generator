Isn't a "Kragen" a fictional sea beast, something like a giant squid or
octopus?  Something with tentacles?  And isn't Kragen's user name,
xentrac, close to an anagram for tentacle?  And isn't unm the University
of New Mexico, adjacent to Detweiler's home state of Colorado?  And here
Kragen is praising Sue D. Nym for having a "beautiful capacity to find
symbolism", when "her" posts seem to be random garbage?  And didn't all
of Kragen, Sue, and the various anonymous Detweiler posts all appear at
about the same time?  And hasn't Detweiler frequently discussed the use
of multiple pseudonyms to mutually support and praise each other in order
to build up an illusionary reputation?

Makes you wonder...
