Given a pair of RSA keys (e,n) and (d,n), the owner may sign a
number x by computing x^d mod n using his private key.  In real
life, x usually consists of a message digest and a small amount
of constant information.  This prevents the product of two
signatures from also being a valid signature.  Anyone may verify
a signature by performing a similar operation using the public
key and recovering x.

Blind signatures allow you to obtain a signature from someone
without disclosing to them what they are signing.  You pick a
random number r and ask the signer to sign x*r^e mod n.  Since r
is arbitrary, this tells the signer nothing about the value of x.

When the signer gives you back r*x^d mod n, you simply multiply
by the multiplicative inverse of r mod n to obtain x^d mod n, the
signed message.  The signer still has no idea what he has signed
and cannot recognize it later if he sees it.

This allows untraceable digital cash, since the bank can sign new
notes for customers that it cannot later recognize.  It has other
interesting uses as well.
