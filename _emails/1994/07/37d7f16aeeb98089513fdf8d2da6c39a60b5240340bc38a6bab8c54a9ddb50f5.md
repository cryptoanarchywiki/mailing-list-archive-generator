[Tim said, roughly, that public actions to replace DES have not
revealed anything about what the NSA & Co. know about DES's
weaknesses.]

Which I guess is part of what I was driving at.

The other part of what I was driving at: DES is becoming crackable by
pure brute force.  Doesn't 3-DES solve that problem for a few orders
of magnatude?

If 3-DES is so simple a variation on DES, then what is wrong with DES
that 3-DES doesn't solve?  (Yes, it is slower in SW than IDEA--I am
talking security for the moment.)


-kb, the Kent who is leery of the new-fangled when the old seems so
easy to fix
