    COMPUTING SOCIETY RELEASES REPORT ON ENCRYPTION POLICY

      "CLIPPER CHIP" CONTROVERSY EXPLORED BY EXPERT PANEL

     WASHINGTON, DC  A panel of experts convened by the nation's 
foremost computing society today released a comprehensive report 
on U.S. cryptography policy.  The report, "Codes, Keys and 
Conflicts: Issues in U.S Crypto Policy," is the culmination of a 
ten-month review conducted by the panel of representatives of the 
computer industry and academia, government officials, and 
attorneys.  The 50-page document explores the complex technical 
and social issues underlying the current debate over the Clipper 
Chip and the export control of information security technology.

     "With the development of the information superhighway, 
cryptography has become a hotly debated policy issue," according 
to Joseph DeBlasi, Executive Director of the Association for 
Computing Machinery (ACM), which convened the expert panel.  "The 
ACM believes that this report is a significant contribution to the 
ongoing debate on the Clipper Chip and encryption policy.  It cuts 
through the rhetoric and lays out the facts."

     Dr. Stephen Kent, Chief Scientist for Security Technology 
with the firm of Bolt  Beranek and Newman, said that he was 
pleased with the final report.  "It provides a very balanced 
discussion of many of the issues that surround the debate on 
crypto policy, and we hope that it will serve as a foundation for 
further public debate on this topic."  

     The ACM report addresses the competing interests of the 
various stakeholders  in  the  encryption debate  --  law 
enforcement agencies,  the intelligence community, industry and 
users of communications services.  It reviews the recent history 
of U.S. cryptography policy and identifies key questions that 
policymakers must resolve as they grapple with this controversial 
issue.

     The ACM cryptography panel was chaired by Dr. Stephen Kent.  
Dr. Susan Landau, Research Associate Professor in Computer Science 
at the University of Massachusetts, co-ordinated the work of the 
panel and did most of the writing. Other panel members were Dr. 
Clinton Brooks, Advisor to the Director, National Security Agency; 
Scott Charney, Chief of the Computer Crime Unit, Criminal 
Division, U.S. Department of Justice; Dr. Dorothy Denning, 
Computer Science Chair, Georgetown University; Dr. Whitfield 
Diffie, Distinguished Engineer, Sun Microsystems; Dr. Anthony 
Lauck, Corporate Consulting Engineer, Digital Equipment 
Corporation; Douglas Miller, Government Affairs Manager, Software 
Publishers Association; Dr. Peter Neumann, Principal Scientist, 
SRI International; and David Sobel, Legal Counsel, Electronic 
Privacy Information Center.  Funding for the cryptography study 
was provided in part by the National Science Foundation. 

     The ACM, founded in 1947, is a 85,000 member non-profit 
educational and scientific society dedicated to the development 
and use of information technology, and to addressing the impact of 
that technology on the world's major social challenges.  For 
general information, contact ACM, 1515 Broadway, New York, NY  
10036. (212) 869-7440 (tel), (212) 869-0481 (fax).

posted soon in this newsgroup.
