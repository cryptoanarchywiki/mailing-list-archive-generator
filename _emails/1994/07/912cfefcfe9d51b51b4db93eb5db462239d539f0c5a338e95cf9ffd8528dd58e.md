This doesn't seem too unreasonable even if the writer only
imagines he is working for the NSA.  The Anonymous Posting
Service at Penet is vulnerable to a number of tricks which might
be used to disclose the identity of posters.  I have always
regarded it as a handy tool for people wishing to maintain a
small degree of privacy while posting on sensitive or
embarrassing topics.  I certainly wouldn't use it to threaten the
President or trade plutonium futures.
