A local public TV program in LA just ended.  One of their closing mini-
items was on the spy porn at Lawrence Livermore (sic).  One host gave a
short version of the hysterical take, including that LLL was going to do
Star Wars, and how terrible their security must be.

Host #2 kicked in with a claim that he knows nothing about computers.

Host #3 did the best thing I can imagine: said it was also part of the
JFK coverup...

FYA.
