Ah.  Thank you -- it's amazing the number of obviously wrong answers
 I received to my question, all of them taking an authoritative tone
 (from "your algorithm doesn't work" (it does) to "your algorithm takes
 enormous amounts of memory" (in fact, it takes 3n)).

Makes one realize (again) how sceptical one must be towards answers 
 received on the 'net, "even" from cypherpunks.   [This isn't to
 slam anyone, just to suggest that people take a little more time to
 think before hitting the 'r' key.]
