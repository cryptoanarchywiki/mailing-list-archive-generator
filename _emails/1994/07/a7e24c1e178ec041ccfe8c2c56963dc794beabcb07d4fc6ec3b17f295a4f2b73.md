I don't believe this is true. You have C0 and C1, but you can not figure
out P0 and P1 without the hash of the concatenation of both keys. Without
this you can not do a meet in in the middle attack, right?

BTW, after thinking about things, I would modify my earlier design in
one way:

Don't concatenate the negation of the two key hash to the hash. The
point of that step was to split the cipher into two equal sized parts,
but there is no reason to require that. In fact the possibility of
different sized parts would add to the confussion. (The probability
of an extreme imbalance in the size of the ciphers is extremelly
small.)

I think that multiplexing based on the hash of the concatenated keys
is as secure as the one way hash function is, no?

Well I don't believe that this is the case, but there is one way to find out
:). I believe that for messages longer than a couple of K, my algorithm
provides substantially more security than its DES analog and is quicker.
I'll write up a version of this that splits into 4 parts and post it here
some time over the next week. I think that splitting into four parts should
be about as quick as double DES while providing substantially more security
than triple DES (which I will time it against).

The question of the security of the split is difficult to resolve so I would
like some help with it. Is multiplexing based on the hash of the concat of
the keys as secure as the hash?
