Much though it pains me to acknowledge that Perry is ever right
about anything:

If I find that the children of fundamentalists are being "cured"
I will move my ammo stash from my garage to hole in the hills,
and take my gold out of the safety deposit box, and add booby
traps to my alarm system.

It is completely impossible for a private person to insulate
his children from opposing views.  Only the state has that
kind of power.

Unlike Mike, I have actually raised children.  Once every
few months I make them sit still for about thirty seconds
and utter a few Words of Profound Wisdom in their general
direction.

Surprisingly this has proved startlingly effective.  The
infrequent comments from their father have proved vastly
more influential than the steady propaganda they receive
from their compulsory government miseducation.

By who?

I gather you do not entirely trust parents to perform this
important social activity.

Who is more likely to care about the welfare of a kid?

A fundamentalist who happens to be the kids father, or 
bureaucrat in charge of child welfare?
