(Ignoring Det-bait :) No, but I think we *agree* with T. C. May more
than can be explained by the kind of people who subscribe to the list.
I think we see the logic in his postings, and since he is usually
considerably better at argument than anyone on the list who disagrees
with him, we tend to believe him.

What I mean by this is that there are too many people who think that
the above things will *matter*.  Clipper is flopping and will continue
to flop.  DT, in whatever form, will never be useful; the government
simply does not have the resources to closely watch the phone network.
If a singularity-producing AI is born, well, all bets may be off...
but then again, the AI might want a little privacy too.  ITAR is
dying, and we already have a National ID Card.  We have had one for
more than half a century.

But the government which supports these things is being pulled
gradually into the embrace of communism.  Inexorably, communism sucks
at the hearts of the American voters.  The decline of America's
current government is already irreversible.  Our duty, as human beings
at the scene of the crime, is to make its death as pleasant as
possible, and its rebirth as innocuous as possible.

:) It's not millenarianism, Eli.  It's just confidence that in this
age, when information is exchanged in ways it never has been before,
the old forms of government and economy won't work anymore.
