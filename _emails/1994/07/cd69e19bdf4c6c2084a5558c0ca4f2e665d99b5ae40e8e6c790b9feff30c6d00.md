Does anyone have a FAQ (or a brainstorm) on how to route Microsoft Mail
messages to appropriate folders based on message content?
...............................................

1.  You can use the Message Finder feature in MS Mail to collect all of 
the messages, say To: "cypherpunks" and then move all of these to a 
folder.  You can also select all the email sent directly to your name 
or to a specific alias, read these, and continue searching the inbox 
this way for messages groups.

2.  There's a software program from Beyond Incorported called WinRules 
1.0, which will filter incoming messages according to who the message 
is From, To, CC, words in content, attachments, etc. and route them to 
folders, optionally popping up a message or a sound as a folder 
receives email throughout the day.  It also has some other neat 
features which you can set to deal with email traffic.
