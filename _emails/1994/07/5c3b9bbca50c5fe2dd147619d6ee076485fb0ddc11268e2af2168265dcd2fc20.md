HEY!  I've read Schneier (if that is what you meant).

Eric also went into various details of how to reveal cards to
individuals (my hand) and all players (the current trick),
etc.--details I am not prepared to comment on yet.  I have some
reading to do first!

I also need to review (learn) a collection of card games to appreciate
their requirements, whether there is a tractable common set of
operations.  (Ironic to have a virtual non-card player consider this
choice of project.)  Crypto is not the only thing I need to read.
