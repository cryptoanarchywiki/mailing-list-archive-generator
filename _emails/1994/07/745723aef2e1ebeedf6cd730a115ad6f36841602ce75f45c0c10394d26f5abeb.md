Chill out friend. We are working on a bugfix release to PGP which will
fix several important bugs. The bug you mention is fixed in our
development sources and will be fixed in the next release. Read Colin's
note carefully. If you do you will realize that this problem is not
a disaster.

The reason that you need good random numbers for cryptographic
purposes is to make an exhaustive search through all possible values
of a key too hard to do. There is more then enough randomness in the
random pool even with this bug to prevent someone from being able
to search all possible values.
