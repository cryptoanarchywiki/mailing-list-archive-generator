Advocating allowance for personal methods of achieving security 
establishes acceptance of the idea intellectually, and there can be 
many philosophical conflicts on that point with the Feds (and others).  
Because although you may have the tools,  if the Feds have their way, 
no one would be allowed to use them (except surreptitiously).

If there is available a good product, which works well, which can be 
used for the purpose of obtaining personal security (apart from what a 
government can offer) then individuals will want to use it when they 
see/feel the need for it.  They will seek it because it's there.

Making useful products which work will contribute to the end of finding 
ways to "give" other people security;  they can't get it if there is 
not a way or a means to implement it.
