Er, if we knew how to do that, we wouldn't need remailers. :) 

What we do need are more remailers that aren't subject to political
pressure or likely to be killed because someone writes to 'Postmaster'.

Accordingly, I'm pleased to announce the deployment of my own remailer -
'remailer@ideath.goldenbear.com'. I can't say that the arrangement that
gets me my news/mail feed is entirely without politics, but the sysadmin
above me is, I believe, also pro-privacy and pro-remailer.

The remailer is not intended for use for extortion, harassment, fraud,
defamation, or spamming the net. There are no content filters installed
but if I learn of use which involves the above I will take whatever
steps I think necessary to eliminate non-acceptable uses.

The software is Chael Hall's remailer system - PGP encrypted messages are
not yet supported (unless there's a new version I don't know of). 
Sometimes I talk to my feed site with TCP/IP, sometimes with UUCP. This
means that messages may get between 0 and 24 hours of delay; I know of
no way to predict the length of the delay. 

Detweiler, you may not use my remailer nor any of my computer systems
in any way at any time, under any name. If anyone's got his physical
address I'd like to get it so that I may send him a copy of my "no
permission" message, registered mail.
