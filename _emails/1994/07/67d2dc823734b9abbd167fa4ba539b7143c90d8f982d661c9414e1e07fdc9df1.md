    From this morning's SJMN:

    Williams & Macias (800 310 0890) has developed a gloss paper stock
    that lets you print bumper stickers on an ordinary laser printer.
    ... called Product Codes 2041 and 2042 which differ in that the 
    first has three stickers per 8.5 x 11 sheet which are slightly
    smaller than "standard" bumper stickers. The latter has 2 full
    sized ones.  Both are priced at $19 and get you 20 sheets so
    there are 60 or 40 respectively.  The stickers have a permanent
    weatherproof adhesive backing and are made from weather resistant
    paper.

    Cypherpunks write bumper stickers too(?).
