I did a telnet to the full address (less her name), and logged in
as guest.  She appears to be legit, so one could conclude she
doesn't care...although, truth be told, her message strikes me as
a reasonable example of 'obscurity'.

I was rather impressed by the services Mindvox offers...you might
want to take a tour...
