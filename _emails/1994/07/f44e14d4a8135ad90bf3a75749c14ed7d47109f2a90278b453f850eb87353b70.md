From the NY times reports

   The administration is willing to consider alternatives to Clipper that are
   based upon nonclassified algrithms, and where the escrow agents are
   not government agencies.  They still insist on an escrow system,
   however.

   There's a quote from Marc Rotenberg saying that the escorw requirement
   is still unacceptable.

Hmm.  If the escrow agent isn't a government entity, then what sort of
coercion will they have over that agent in order to get the keys in a
timely fashion?

The Cypherpunks Key Escrow Agency could volunteer to be one of the escrow
agents, and upon receipt of a request for their part of an escrowed key,
could act with all of the haste that the Feds seems to consider reasonable
for the CJR and FOIA requests from the cypherpunks community.
