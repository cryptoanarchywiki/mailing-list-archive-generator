Like the guy from Microsoft, I don't know specifically what's in
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11. 

But something to remember is that RSA Data Security Inc. has been
concentrating on signing deals with Microsoft, Apple, Lotus, IBM,
WordPerfect, Oracle, etc., to include strong crypto in their products.

I don't happen to know if Windows for Warehouses (er, Workgroups)
contains RSA, but it wouldn't surprise me at all. Anyone know?

That we are comparing commercial crypto to "a real secure solution"
like PGP, as in the question Andrzej asked, is an ironic twist.
