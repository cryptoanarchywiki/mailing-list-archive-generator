I'm sure if someone had mailed this sue person, and politey explained why they
felt her posts to be inappropriate, she would have changed her behavior.
...........................................................

FYI,  I did write to the "sue person" and explained further about list 
subjects & LD's subjects, and received the reply  that (among other things):

	"OK OK I will try to lay of the posting for awhile."

If nym@netcom.com is not LD, then it should be that he/she will hold 
true to their word.
