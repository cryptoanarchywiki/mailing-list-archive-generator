My reading of the BSA blurb was that software key escrow really is
being planned: "software implementable [and] based on a non-classified
encryption formula".  Yes, this sounds pretty silly.  I don't see how
you could possibly prevent a rogue phone from interoperating with a
fascistic one.  Guess I need to snarf the original document.
