Detweiler is judged harshly because of his poor behavior, not because
he uses pseudonyms. He would be flamed even more vigorously, I predict,
if he were to reappear with his real name. The pseudonymity does not
make him suspect, the message content does. His plaintive "you all suck -
why are you mean to me - I hate you - can't we be friends? - I'm leaving,
you're awful - maybe I'll stay - I'm just a newbie, be nice to me -
you all suck" whining is classic Detweiler; the recent message to Perry
"accidentally" forwarded to the list takes me back to last summer in a
swoon of deja vu. 

I can't tell whether Xenon or Detweiler wins the prize for most frequently
announcing their final, irrevocable, non-negotiable departure from the
Cypherpunks list and all of its arrogant maniac-losers who don't understand
how things *REALLY ARE*, followed by a re-emergence within a month or two.
Does anyone out there have an accurate count?
