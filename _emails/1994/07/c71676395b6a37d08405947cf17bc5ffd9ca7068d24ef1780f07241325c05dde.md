This is incorrect.  There is a possible security problem with *pure*
RSA, but PGP does not use pure RSA.  When you encrypt to multiple
recipients in PGP (and you can verify this by reading the code), you
choose a random IDEA session key, and then you RSA-encrypt that key
(with random-data padding) in each public key, changing the random
padding with each encryption.

No can do; this would validate the MIT license on the code.  The
change, about which you can obtain via anonymous ftp even if you are
not in the US, is that the data-packet version number will change from
'2' to '3' on september 1st, rendering older versions unable to read
the data after 1 September.

Hope this helps
