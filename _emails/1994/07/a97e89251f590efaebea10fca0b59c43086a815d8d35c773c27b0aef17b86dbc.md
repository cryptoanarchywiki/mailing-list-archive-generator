Remember, any 1 key gets nuked, you are safe.  I personaly would use the 
NSA as one of them if I was running a buisness where key escrow made 
sense, for exactly the reasons they gave, and would trust it even more if 
they had a mandate to distroy them on mass seazure.  This is not a mater 
of puting absolute trust in one agancy, but trusting one agency to act 
*in* *one* *case* as a great protector, namely, if we are invaded, they 
would no doubt distroy their database, and your privacy would be protected.

Long shot, but so is 2^128.
