You don't need the Post Office or Federal Reserve to do it;
banks are perfectly good at keeping information mostly private
and giving it to the government when they want it - they do that
with your financial records now, assuming you use US banks.
They may also be in the business of providing genuine key escrow
for people who want it, e.g. backup copies of corporate data and keys,
as well as government keymaster subcontracting.

Phone companies could also do the job, but if the Information Superhighway
has Information Police running speed traps like Louis Freeh wants,
or Friendly Platform-Opening Regulacrats like some other folks want,
they'll be cooperative enough about keeping their own copies of the keys
in case they're subpoenaed.
