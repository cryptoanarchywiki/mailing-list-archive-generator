The political Left had the belief that while you, an individual, should 
have the right to do what you want with your body. . ., they wanted to 
control what you did with your money. . . The political Right had the 
belief that you should have the right to do what you want with your 
money . . , but not with your body. . .  .
..................................................
	True!

....programs such as healthcare, Clipper, national ID cards, national 
information infrastructures,
and so forth are all direct yet subtle attacks on such basic freedoms. 
It creates both the motive *and* mechanism for tyrrany.
..................................................
	Thus the Administration would undermine the motives & mechanisms for privacy.
	
	Everyone wants the advantages for themselves and not for their 
enemies; it would be useful to be able to distinguish enemies from 
friends, but this is not an easy task when everyone's philosophies & 
politics are so mixed up  & inconsistent & counterproductive.

	At some point, it becomes unavoidable to conclude that in reality, 
it's "every man for himself"; i.e. -  anything which helps individual, 
independent competence is a valuable & valid pursuit.
