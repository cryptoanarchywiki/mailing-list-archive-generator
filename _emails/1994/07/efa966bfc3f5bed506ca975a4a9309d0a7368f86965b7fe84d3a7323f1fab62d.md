C'punks,

Okay, I'm getting just a little tired of this thread.  I've addressed 
several posts in private e-mail, but I think one public statement is 
required.

On Fri, 22 Jul 1994, Alex Brock, addressing Connie Sadler, wrote:

Yet another list member volunteers to speak for the group.  If Alex want 
to be a "low life," so be it.  Just don't drag the rest of us along.  I 
thought Cypherpunks were interested in taking positive steps to protect 
privacy.  Connie has told us she shares that goal, so I think that makes 
her just as much a Cypherpunk as the rest of us "lowlifes."

By the same token, Alex, nobody personally pulled your chain, either. 
Maybe you should filter Connie from your mail, or else unsubscribe. 

My fellow Cypherpunks, "can't we all just get along?"  Let's continue to
focus on privacy.  Isn't that what we're here for?


 S a n d y

P.S.  I've exchanged e-mail with Connie.  She's very nice and very much 
      on our side.  A good recruit for Cypherpunks.
