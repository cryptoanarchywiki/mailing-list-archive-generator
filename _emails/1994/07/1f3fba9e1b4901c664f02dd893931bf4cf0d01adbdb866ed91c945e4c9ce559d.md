Those who have studied the matter generally believe that factoring
is NP, but is not NP complete.

Factoring cannot be "even harder than NP" since a simple minded
brute force attack is 2^(n/2), which is only NP

As Timothy May points out, if factoring is NP, then modest increases
in key length can easily defeat enormous improvements in factoring.

In the highly unlikely event that P = NP then we have also solved, as
an almost trivial special case, the problems of true artificial
intelligence, artificial consciousness, and artificial perception,
and the failure of one particular form of crypto will not be noticed
in the midst of such radical changes.
