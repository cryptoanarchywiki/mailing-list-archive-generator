Has anyone else noticed that David Sternlight has been quiet for the past 
two weeks or so?

I hope he's not like you-know-who in that mentioning his name summons the
fiend.

ObCrypto: Maybe he has decided that PGP 2.6 is okay, and now has had the
          wind removed from his sails...   Doubt it.
