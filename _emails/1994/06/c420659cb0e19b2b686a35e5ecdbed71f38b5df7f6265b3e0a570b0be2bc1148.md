Nobodu asks if FTP-by-mail from a US site will let outsiders
retrieve crypto.  Most of the popular crypto sites in the US
that support non-exportable materials store them in a directory
that's constantly being renamed, and require you to read a readme file
with the license material so you've been warned before they'll tell you
where it is.  Most of the popular ftp-by-email sites have tended to
be slow when I've used them :-)  So it may not work very well,
unless you catch a fast ftp-by-mail site.  MIT requires you to
telnet to ftp-dist.mit.edu and log on to register for PGP,
which is tougher to do by email.
