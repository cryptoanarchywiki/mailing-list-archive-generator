I agree with Perry's assessment, and would like to summarize the
conclusion of the article since it is about the blurring of 
national boundaries and lack of control by authority:

It is expressed that pedophiles who can communicate with like-minded
people anywhere in the world (where laws against it do not exist) will
get the impression that they are normal, okay people who live under an
unjust state.  Additionally, it is mentioned that unsupervised (i.e.,
no psychiatrist present) discussion between pedophiles will also
reinforce their predilections.

Unfortunately, the article does not mention how the blurring of 
national boundaries and uncontrolled (polically incorrect, etc.) 
conversations would also be beneficial.  Perhaps the real upshot
of the article is "May you live in interesting times".
