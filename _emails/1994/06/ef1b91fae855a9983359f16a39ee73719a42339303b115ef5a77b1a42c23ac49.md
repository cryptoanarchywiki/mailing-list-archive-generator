Derek's list is incomplete; Sternlight also alleged that there were
"copyright problems" with PGP, insinuating that some of the code in PGP
had been copied (or derived from) RSAREF code - he backed down pretty
quickly when asked for substantiation. He also wrote to the administrators
of US-based FTP sites, suggesting that PKP/RSADSI was contemplating legal
action against them if they didn't stop making PGP available via FTP. I
suspect (but cannot prove) that he was also the person who reported those
FTP sites to Bidzos, thus creating the lawsuit threat that he then pretended
to protect the FTP sites from.

He also recently wrote to Netcom administrators, encouraging them to take
action against a user who included a public key marked 2.3a in his
.plan file.
