Another interesting part of this article (Monday San Jose Mercury
News) quotes Lynn McNulty of NIST saying  that they explicitly 
chose DSS as the FIPS digital signature standard in order to
discourage use of RSA.   It looks like Bidzos has a clear 
case for a restraint of trade lawsuit.

Bidzos would also be well advised to tape record any future
conversations he has with NSA officials.
