An important frustration from this electronic age: Information moves
so easily now but people move no more quickly than before.  Changes to
CEB should not be a continuous process.  Changes need to happen slow
enough and in meaningful enoug chunks that someone other than the
author can keep up.  I think this means digests of the changes,
digests which are readable in their own right--not mechanical
diffs--should both detail *and* summarize for those who recently read
the old copy.

Refereing might dove tail nicely with keeping the whole thing stable
enough to be usable.


-kb, a Kent with a thick enough protective coating of ignorance to
avoid most of the work...
