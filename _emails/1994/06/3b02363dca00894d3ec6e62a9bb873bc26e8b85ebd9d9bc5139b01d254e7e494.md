Bob is now doing at least twice as much work as before.  He is
factoring a random key and a real one for each customer he does
business with.  Since the existance of a breakthrough in
factorization is certainly of interest to people who do not want
keys factored, Bob will get lots of requests from the curious,
who have no interest in buying his services.  Should he prove to
someone in the academic community that he can indeed factor keys,
people would simply stop using RSA and Bob's economic future
would be bleak indeed.

Bob needs to charge a lot for his services, and not give free
demos.  The protocol needs to require that the customers commit
to the fee before Bob demonstrates his talent.  This will
discourage enquiries by the frivilous.

Gaaak!  All these people.  You are making Bob paranoid.  Bob is
definitely not going to put an ad in the paper.  His customers
are foreign and domestic law enforcement and intelligence
services and corporate security folks.  Bob wants to keep an
extremely low profile with the Great Unwashed.

Isn't there some way for Bob to conduct business using the
remailer at Hacktic and anonymous DigiCash(TM)?  Bob does not
wish to find himself at the bottom of a large body of water
wearing concrete galoshes.  Bob wishes to factor a few numbers,
transfer the money offshore, and retire without the general
public being aware that RSA has been compromised.

I agree.  I think that $100 a bit would be an extremely
reasonable price for factoring a 1024 bit modulus.
