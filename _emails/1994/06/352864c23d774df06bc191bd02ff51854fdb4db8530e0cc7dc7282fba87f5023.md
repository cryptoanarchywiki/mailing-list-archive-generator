	Fear not, Jim! Reread the article: it says that the CTEK cannot 
be used to fake a bogus ESN (this controls billing). As it says, the CTEK 
is more useful as a cellular monitor than a tool for fraud.

	Of course, this doesn't rule out a very good hardware hacker 
playing with the ROMs in it....
