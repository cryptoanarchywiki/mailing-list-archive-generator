The above assumes that if the NSA does something interesting they'll
tell the world about it. I'm not sure that's a plausible assumption.
They seem to view their mission as creating and maintaining a
balance-of-power of intelligence in favor of the United States;
specifically, gathering intelligence, preserving their ability to
gather intelligence, and preventing others from gathering intelligence.
Revealing the existence or substance of crypto breakthroughs isn't
necessarily compatible with that mission, at least as it's been
historically understood.

(I think remailers are good, but their use makes it necessary to
write to the list to reply; I'd have preferred to reply in E-mail.)
