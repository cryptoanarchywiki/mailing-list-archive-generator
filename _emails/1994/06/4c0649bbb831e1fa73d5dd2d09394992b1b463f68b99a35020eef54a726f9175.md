Well, I just sent mail to you, Sandy at crl.com, but it came back to 
you saying that you were "554 Unbalanced '>' ".    I guess it's in 
reference to the software  :>)

I was just inquiring, since you yourself are lately leaving the US & 
going off to Hong Kong, whether you would be there long enough to be 
part of the events in the changing of the guard to the Commie Chinese?
