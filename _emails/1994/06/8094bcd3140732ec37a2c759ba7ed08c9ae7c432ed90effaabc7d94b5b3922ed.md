What I am looking at is a way to do binary searches in the key space w/ a 
function that would look at a test key and the result of running RSA on 
it and then tell me the relative magnitude between the real key and the
test key. 

What this means is that I could take a cypher-text and attempt a de-crypt
w/ some conveniently large number and then go up or down from there 
till I find it. The advantage of this approach is that it allows one to
search the key-space w/o having to test each and every possibility. This
would significantly(!) reduce the time to crack...
