Here's the last of these articles I plan to forward. This one mentions the
"persistent institutions" idea (based on timed-release crypto mediated by
mutually suspicious agents) I have mentioned at times. (I need to do a
major piece on this, as my comments are mainly scattered in various
places.)

Dave Deltorto was asking about hardware failure of the host machines as a
practical concern and this is what I was initially responding to.

>make storage of such small files quite trivial. (And remember that since

>
>5. The files are likely to be moved around a lot, anyway, making hardware
