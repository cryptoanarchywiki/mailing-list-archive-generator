I would like clarification on Sternlight's contention that PGP violates
RSA's patents.  My understanding is that PGP < 2.4 does not so long as
its use was private and non-commercial.  

In other words, isn't the patent issue a fabrication of Sternlight to
attack PGP?

Or did he really have a point?
