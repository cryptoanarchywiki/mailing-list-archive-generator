     Bingo. :-) It has to know the proper ESN to send the signal to. The
ESN is an Electronic Serial Number, and every Cell Phone has a unique one.
Your cellphone number is attached to the ESN.

     Well, I don't know about the need to let them know. I do know that
you can generally "log in" and "log out" of zones as you pass through
them, allowing the system to track you as you trek across the country.

     This is where I get a little shady on my knowledge. If you substitute
routers for signal centers, and individual nodes for ESNs, you have the
general idea. :-)
