About "Keep Out": you might want to be more precise in your blurbs.  As
things stand, I'm leery of trusting anything I might see in your journal.

RSA is not broken, as far as I know.  If you have verifiable details that
it has, that'll be quite a scoop.  If you meant to say "the _factoring_ of
RSA-129," well, you should have said that instead.

A publisher, of all people, really needs to understand what a copyright
is.  Note that we cannot copyright ideas, only our expression of those
ideas.  Referring to a copyright on "the algorithm used in PGP" is
nonsense.  Instead, PKP holds licensing rights to a system _patent_ on
using RSA to perform public key encryption.


Otherwise, your stuff sounds cool to me, though I'd really prefer that
those who stand to get money for something not do their advertising via
this list.  Submitting boilerplate for comment is fine, but leave it to
other interested parties to pass your advertising brochures to the list.
