I'd like to see PGP eventually remove artifical constraints on key sizes.
The MP package in PGP uses fixed-size buffers, but a more general approach
using variable-sized buffers is used in other packages such as gmp.  These
do not force you to use compiled-in limits on sizes like this.  The basic
multi-precision integer data structure in PGP does have a limit of 64K bits
but that is probably not worth changing.

Remember that it is the owner of a long key who pays most of the price of
using it.  He is the one who has to wait through lengthy signs and decrypts.
The signature-checking and encryption which other people do just involve
a few multiplications and should be pretty fast even for sizable keys.  So
I don't see any reason PGP should take this decision out of people's hands.

I'm still running 2.3.  I figure that when the time comes I'll hack it to
accept 2.6 messages.
