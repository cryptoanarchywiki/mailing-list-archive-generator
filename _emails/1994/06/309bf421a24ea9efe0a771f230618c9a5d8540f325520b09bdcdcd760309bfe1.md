Defense Messaging System is supposedly going to use Skipjack,
so I assume it's reasonably secure - and if there *are*
NSA-only backdoors in the algorithm, at least they won't
be admitting it to your neighbor hood cops and FBI wiretappers,
so you'd have to be an *interesting* suspect to get cracked.
