Well, there's a lot of stuff on the gopher site at chaos.bsu.edu...
Some of it was a bit out of date last time I checked tho.

Yeah, it didn't answer the pings my software sent out because it
doesn't support Request-Remailing-To.  I changed it to Anon-Send-To,
and it's in the list now.

Yes and no.  I think vox.hacktic.nl can post to usenet with
X-Anon-To: alt.whatever.usenet.group

It won't include the reply block if you send mail to remailer@soda
from another remailer.  (I haven't tried this using all the
remailers tho, so I don't know if it will recognize them all as
being non-replyable addresses.)  Otherwise, you can chain from soda
to my remailer and use the Cutmarks: feature to snip it.

Well, there's mg5n+remailers@andrew.cmu.edu ...
