I don't understand: why can't the somebody do a telnet to port 25 and
"vrfy nobody" to see if it points to /dev/null?  Or find out if mail
is piped to a script?

Again, a pretty good suggestion, but I don't think most remailer
operators can do this even if they wanted to.  I know I couldn't have
with remailers I've run in the past.
