The card design isn't so much security as avoiding scarce real estate on
a PC (which, at somewhere over 130 million units fielded, is a not
inconsiderable market segment).  If this were a dongle device, I'd want
it on a parallel port.  Many machines don't have a spare serial port,
and transparent dongles would be harder to do there, anyway.  But
transparent parallel port dongle technology is already established.
