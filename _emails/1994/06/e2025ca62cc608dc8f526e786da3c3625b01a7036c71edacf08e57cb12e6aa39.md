What I envision here is that the user will have to setup the keys for the
various accounts on other re-mailers. The only other option I have is to
make a header switch such that the outgoing is clear-text. 

I am not shure if I want to support this feature or not. What I had intended 
was to build it to support person to person transmissions w/ the anon built
in to make traffic analysis by address harder. I will have to look at
chaining.

Thanks for the input...
