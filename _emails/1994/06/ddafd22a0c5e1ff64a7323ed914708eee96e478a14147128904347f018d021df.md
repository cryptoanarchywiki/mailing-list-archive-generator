Stanton,

<Initial news from
Intelligence Committee staffers is that the crypto provisions of H.R. 3937
were axed with an unbelievable 13-0 unanimous vote, in clear blatant
disregard for the opinion of constituents and the general public.>

So much for lobbying.

Look, something is going on here that doesn't meet the eye. Nothing is 
ever unanimous in Washington. These guys were told something by somebody
that caused them to vote like this. You can bet it had nothing to do with
terrorists, drug pushers, or pedophiles. Why don't you expend 
some effort to find out what they were told and by whom so we could learn 
what this issue is really about because it is NOT about "national security".
