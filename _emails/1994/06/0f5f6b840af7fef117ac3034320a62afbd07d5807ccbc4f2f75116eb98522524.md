This phenom is one of my big hopes for cyberspace.  Acquiesence in state 
control was caused by normal primate urges to get along with one's 
"tribe."  Cyberspace extends the changes that have already occured through 
urbanization and travel to a new threshold.  With interface improvements 
we will be able to live societies of our own choosing and enhance feelings 
of personal autonomy.
