Encryption could be used as a secure means of storage of accumulated material
(on site) until a security gap can be found, though.  And if anyone does any
snooping, they can't see through the encryption to see if it's really company
secrets, thus protecting the spy.

Again, encryption is sort of a nice safety net.  They can catch you with the
tape, but they've only got you on suspicion of espionage, and the evidence
is encrypted.

I was thinking more about data being held hostage.

Encryption offers the possibility of restoring the information... no doubt
for a price of some sort.  Few companies would like to admit to being
blackmailed in this fashion.

Sabotage, on the other hand, is much less flexible, and hence would be the
practice of comparative amateurs.  If you destroy everything, and get caught,
what do you have to bargain with?
