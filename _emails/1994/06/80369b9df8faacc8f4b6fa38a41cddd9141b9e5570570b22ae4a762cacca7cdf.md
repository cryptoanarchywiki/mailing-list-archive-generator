I like to use the Common Law distiction between Malum in Se and Malum 
Prohibitum.  ("wrong because it is wrong" and "wrong because it is 
prohibited.")  There are lots of "legislative crimes" that are creatures 
of their time and place.  Cyberspace is a hard place to commit real 
wrongs in.  Those of us of a more libertarian bent think that the major 
benefit of cyberspace is that it makes certain crimes like "legislation" 
less effective.  Note that Common Law crimes were "discovered" by judges 
without legislatures.
