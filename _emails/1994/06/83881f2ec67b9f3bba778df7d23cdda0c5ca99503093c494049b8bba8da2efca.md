           Cypherpunks' Electronic Book (CEB) 4

   Martin Janzen suggests using World Wide Web (WWW) to support &
distribute the CEB. I am not at all familiar with WWW but hopefully its
good. My concern with this distributed organization is that CEB could
be controlled by the Cypherpunks' List & that all additions & changes
to CEB would be refereed. No unauthorized changes would be made.
   As for updates, the point of CEB is to be made up of the most recent
knowledge. People concerned with an area of electronic privacy & making
contributions to the CEB would naturally update the CEB whenever they
ran into new developments. People who wanted to read the CEB would be
assured that by the nature of the CEB, what they found there would be
the latest & the current best.
   Martin suggests that the CEB could be on several servers. I would
suggest, then, that they be on different servers by chapter. Referees
who are interested in particular chapters could maintain & administer
that chapter. This could mean very little administration by Eric
Hughes (cringe).
   For those who are kindly offering their archives of Cypherpunks'
list, they are not needed now, but if & when the CEB gets established,
it would be good to have your names on the CEB as archivists.
                                         Yours Truly,
                                         Gary Jeffers
