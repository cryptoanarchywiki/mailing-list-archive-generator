Stuart Baker, of all people, (in his recent Wired article) mentions
that digital signatures will mean never having to give out your credit
card number over the phone or the net.

Did we go over this one?  Were any of those recent press releases about
acceptable(*) crypto, over-the-phone credit cards?

(*)By acceptable, I mean, okay, it's not cash and I still have to trust the
issuing bank, but at least it's secure otherwise.
