I must disagree. His analysis that discussion by pedophiles on
alt.sex.intergen is likely 100% covered by the first amendment was a
statment we would all agree with. I'd say his article was more on the
lines of "here are problems" not "here are problems -- lets regulate
the net". He didn't appear to be advocating any new laws or law
enforcement activities. I thought that the article was a bit of a
downer, but it was hardly horrifying. Indeed, I'd say it was quite
well written.
