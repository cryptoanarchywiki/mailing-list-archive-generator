C'punks,

Would you and your SO like a great slacker job in the San
Francisco Bay Area?  Yes?  Well, have I got a deal for you!

I will be leaving for Hongkong (by way of Madison, Wisc., it
would now appear) in the latter part of July.  I'm looking for
someone to take over my slacker job managing a self-storage
facility in lovely Marin county.  Here's the deal:

WHAT YOU GET

    -- Two bedroom, two bath, 1200 sq.ft. house (rent free)
       with large living and dining rooms, porch, covered
       carport, big backyard and garden, in a fenced compound.

    -- Washer and dryer, dishwasher, disposal, gas range and
       electric oven.

    -- Free electricity(!), water and garbage pick-up, plus
       $25/mo. towards gas.

    -- All of the above, is within a short walking distance
       of shopping centers, supermarkets, restaurants, parks,
       government offices and public transportation.

WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

    -- Be on site from 8:00am to 6:00pm, M-F.

    -- Walk the self-storage yard several times per day.

    -- Answer the phone and give information about storage
       (averages less than 10 calls per day).

    -- Assist potential and current customers (averages about
       once per day).

    -- Misc. duties (averages less than 20 minutes per day).

Most of the time in this position is your own.  You can read,
watch TV, eat, work on your computer--whatever.  Of course
because there is no pay, you much have another source of income.
This could mean having an SO with an outside job, you doing shift
work, telecommuting or running your own at-home business.  In
addition, this is a stealth position.  It has an extremely low
profile if you manage things properly.

If you're interested, call, write or e-mail me at the address at
the top of this message.
