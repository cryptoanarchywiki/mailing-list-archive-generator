Folks:

I am looking for the source for a Windows front end for PGP.
I know that WINFRONT is available (on special application)
in source, but it's written in Visual Basic.  I guess that
I could get VB and learn it, but I was hoping that someone
knew of a C version.  It doesn't need to be particularly
polished, since I will be making some changes to suit my
own format.  I know its a lot to ask, but I can hope, can't I.
(The path name would help too.)

Peace
