Well, Hal Finney offered a service by which people could subscribe to
an encrypted version of this list... which is something similar.

Say somebody wants to run a mailing list as you propose.  I think they
should just run the list at the same address unless the remailers can
suitably pad, delay, and randomize incoming messages and redirect them
to the true list site (but then delay and randomization may lead to
loss of coherency on the list ;).  If not, surely external observation
of the contact point will show where all the messages are headed.

The resources needed would be higher than a normal list since each
incoming message would need to be checked for a digital signature (or
the list could become victim to an anonymous mail bomber, and you
can't filter out anonymous remailers since of course everybody is
using them to submit posts!), encrypted to every other member, and
remailed.

Which isn't to say impossible, just maybe impractical for a large
mailing list.  Take this list, with say 500 members - every incoming
post digitally signed and arriving via anonymous remailer, and upon
arrival, checked for a valid signature, encrypted with the public keys
of the pseudonyms subscribing to the list;), and remailed out...

This may work if you have a small group of people dedicated to this
setup, but otherwise, no go.  I mean, most people on this list don't
even sign their posts, most don't submit via anonymous remailer, etc.
It would take much work to make it convenient enough to do this.

I think a higher priority is finding the bug that keeps unsubscribing
everybody ;)
