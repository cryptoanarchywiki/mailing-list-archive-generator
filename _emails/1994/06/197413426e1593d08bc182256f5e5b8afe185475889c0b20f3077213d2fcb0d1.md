     My congratulations on a well-written document. I agree 100% with what
you said on a cursory view. I haven't looked into this very deeply yet.
But, the points you bring up are valid, and need to EXPLOITED before
Clipper becomes a standard. Even then, I'll still use PGP, or whatever the
newest secure gizmo is at the time. Let them put me on a list for
protecting my privacy. It'd be an honor to be recognized for it.
