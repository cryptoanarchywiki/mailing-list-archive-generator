Well, yes, IBM did create DES.  But the NSA against its better judgment
blessed the effort, and by my guessing helped tremendously.  I have heard
rumors that NSA *does* say it was their biggest mistake, and never again.

There is no way I can prove a rumor, but I put a lot of credence in these
particular rumors.  I speculate that it was Bobby Inman who ordered NSA
to facilitate IBM.
