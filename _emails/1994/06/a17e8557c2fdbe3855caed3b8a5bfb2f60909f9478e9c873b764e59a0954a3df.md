just heard it myself and yes, it was very good.
luckily, all participants talked fast (i can't stand slow talkers :)
so they got their points in...

i digitized it though i missed the first minute (nothing important, intro
only) and a few seconds after the first station id break.  cheezy sun mike
pickup only since i couldn't find a patch cable in time but it sounds okay.

does anybody want a 26Mb .au file (uncompressed) ?  heh :)
i'll make it available on my home page soon,
but it's available via anon ftp now.
mail me if you want it...

what's the copyright laws on this stuff anyway?
