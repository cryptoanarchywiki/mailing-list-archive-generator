I don't know whether you all have seen this: I've got a double-sawbuck that
says it's nonsense, but those of you who are into recreational paranoia may
enjoy it.  

I especially enjoyed the mention of the Bilderbergers...

>NSA can crack PGP
>
>A lot of people think that PGP encryption is unbreakable and that the
>NSA/FBI/CIA/MJ12 cannot read their mail. This is wrong, and it can be a deadly
>mistake. In Idaho, a left-wing activist by the name of Craig Steingold was
>arrested  _one day_ before he and others went to stage a protest at government
>buildings; the police had a copy of a message sent by Steingold to another
>activist, a message which had been encrypted with PGP and sent through E-mail.
>
>Since version 2.1, PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy") has been rigged to
>allow the NSA to easily break encoded messages. Early in 1992, the author,
>Paul Zimmerman, was arrested by Government agents. He was told that he
>would be set up for trafficking narcotics unless he complied. The Government
>agency's demands were simple: He was to put a virtually undetectable
>trapdoor, designed by the NSA, into all future releases of PGP, and to
>tell no-one.
>
>After reading this, you may think of using an earlier version of
>PGP. However, any version found on an FTP site or bulletin board has been
>doctored. Only use copies acquired before 1992, and do NOT use a recent
>compiler to compile them. Virtually ALL popular compilers have been
>modified to insert the trapdoor (consisting of a few trivial changes) into
>any version of PGP prior to 2.1. Members of the boards of Novell, Microsoft,
>Borland, AT&T and other companies were persuaded into giving the order for the
>modification (each ot these companies' boards contains at least one Trilateral
>Commission member or Bilderberg Committee attendant).
>
>It took the agency more to modify GNU C, but eventually they did it.
>The Free Software Foundation was threatened with "an IRS investigation",
>in other words, with being forced out of business, unless they complied. The
>result is that all versions of GCC on the FTP sites and all versions above
>2.2.3, contain code to modify PGP and insert the trapdoor. Recompiling GCC
>with itself will not help; the code is inserted by the compiler into
>itself. Recompiling with another compiler may help, as long as the compiler
>is older than from 1992.
