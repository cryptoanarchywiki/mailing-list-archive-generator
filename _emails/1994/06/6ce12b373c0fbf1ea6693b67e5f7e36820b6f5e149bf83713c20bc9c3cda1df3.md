I don't understand your use of the term "ellipse" here. You mean like
a circle? Like a big O? O, I see.

(Just kidding. Spelling flames are especially pointless on a list like this.)

None of us knows everything. The things I know little or nothing
about, I stay out of. I think this is reasonable. The list has 500 or
so people on it, and there's no point in 500 people watchin someone
presume to speak on computational complexity without even knowing the
basic terms, such as Big O notation (for which I would recommend _any_
computer science textbook, perhaps Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman, or even
a more basic text...the new Leiserson, Rivest, etc. text covers a lot
of such things).

On things I know little or nothing about, I just don't post. You won't
see me rambling on about swIPe, encrypted IP tunnels, algebraic number
theory, etc. (Some of these things I know just enough about to know
they are important, but I leave the inner workings for others.)

The recent unpleasantness is just a continuing pattern of someone
getting a bug in his bonnet and not letting a topic drop.

Let's just let it drop.
