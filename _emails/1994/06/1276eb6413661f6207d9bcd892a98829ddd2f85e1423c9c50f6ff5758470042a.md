	 Defense Messaging System is supposedly going to use Skipjack,
	 so I assume it's reasonably secure - and if there *are*
	 NSA-only backdoors in the algorithm, at least they won't
	 be admitting it to your neighbor hood cops and FBI wiretappers,
	 so you'd have to be an *interesting* suspect to get cracked.

Not only that, there have been too many spies found in the various
intelligence agencies for them to risk such a thing.
