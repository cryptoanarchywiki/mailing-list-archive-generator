Re: copyrights, I have yet to hear Herr Sternlight say that pgp23a does
not have copyright problems.  He may not be asserting that as much,
but he has yet to recant.  It all started in a discussion about NAFTA,
GATT and patents.  Someone posted a passage from GATT about expansion
of copyrights (NOT patents).  He then used that post to assert that
pgp23a infringes in Europe.  When it was pointed out that the discussion
had been about patents, he asserted that pgp23a also violated copyrights
(I think he was just too embarrassed to admit confusing patents and
copyrights).  When I last asked him directly about why he thought pgp23a
violated, he used the fact that the pgp doc's referred to itself as
"contraband" as evidence.

Re: SternCop, he wrote to support@netcom.com complaining that he had found
a pgp23a key in beker@netcom.com's .plan file.  Netcom told him that
he should take the matter up with PKP/RSADSI.  Beker posted Sternlight's
message here and I forwarded it to alt.security.pgp.  This really bugged
Sternlight and he then wrote ANOTHER letter to support@netcom.com
asserting that beker had violated his copyright.  He also sent me
a similair message and told me that he knew the Chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board and that I had better publicly apologize to him.
He warned me that his complaints about me would not go to postmaster but
rather to his own contacts.  Why he thought economists would care about
usenet is beyond me.  Anyway...  support@netcom.com told him they didn't
think beker violated his copyright and if he wanted to pursue the matter
further he should sue beker.  I have yet to hear about his complaints
about me.  If he did complain to anyone about me, they must've completely
blown him off.

Anyway, my all-time favorite Sternlight quote follows:

I don't speak for the Federal Reserve Board, they don't speak for me.
