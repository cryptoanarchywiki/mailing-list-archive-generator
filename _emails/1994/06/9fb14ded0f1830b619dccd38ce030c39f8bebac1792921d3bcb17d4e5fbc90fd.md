Thanks for remembering, Eli! 

Actually, I'm reading the list but not posting much (trying to finish
the Document Whose Name May Not be Spoken). As Steve Witham said
earlier tonight, not many old-timers are commenting on this thread.

I've found that posting comments about early work generates
ill-tempered "you old-timers have no respect for the enthusiasm of
newbies" posts. (Well, a slight exaggeration, perhaps.)

Yes, there were many posts a while back on "Timed-Release Crypto." I
can repost some of these articles, if there's interest.
