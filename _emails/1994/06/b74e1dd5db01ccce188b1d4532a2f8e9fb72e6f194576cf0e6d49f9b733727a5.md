No, Mr. Jeffers is _too_ _busy_ debugging his TSR to bring a menu.  He
thinks it would be a terrific idea, though, and is beside himself that no
one has rushed out and invested their savings into buying a desktop
publishing system to produce a menu, and then opening a restaurant to
provide the cookware and the kitchen needed to prepare the rabbit which
_he_ has decided _we_ all need to eat.

For someone who professes to want to "beat the State", Mr. Jeffers seems to
have a lot of personal energy invested in trying to get people to do what
he says...

As Tim has pointed out with his usual grandmotherly kindness, the "CEB" is
hardly an original idea.  Every three or four months, someone new runs in
and shouts, "Hey, kids!  Let's put on a _show_!"  Mr. Jeffers will, sadly,
not be the last, I suspect.
