The timed-release crypto message I just forwarded (in a kind of
timed-release fashion) generated some interesting comments from Karl
Barrus, Marc Ringuette, Robin Hanson, Eric Hughes, and even Larry
Detweiler--back when he was not so antipathetic (he's pathetic _and_
antipathetic, paradoxically) to our group.

For historical reasons, and because he makes some good points, here's his post:
