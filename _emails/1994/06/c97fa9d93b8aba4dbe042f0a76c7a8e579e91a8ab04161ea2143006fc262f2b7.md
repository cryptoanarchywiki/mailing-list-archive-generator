The last time I read anything on the subject, conspiracy exists when
any co-conspirator makes any action included in the planned event.

If no one makes the first move, no felony.  Make any action to complete
a step of the crime and you automatically become conspirators.

Even if the plan is to commit a misdemeanor, the conspiracy is a felony, 
and one frowned upon by LE types.

Well, back to lurking.  It isn't often I have much to add to the group.
I do enjoy the exercise sifting through the distilled thoughts of a bright
bunch.
