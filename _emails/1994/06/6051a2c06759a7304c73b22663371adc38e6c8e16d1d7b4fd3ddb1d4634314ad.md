Several companies make cellular test sets (or optional modules for
more general purpose RF test sets) that perform functions very much
like those of the CTEK package. Since we manufacture cell phones, we
have a perfectly legitimate reason to have a few of those test sets
around here.  And I know of no special licensing requirements to buy
them (other than having $20,000 or so in cash).
