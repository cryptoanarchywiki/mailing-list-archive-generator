Not quite. I thought that the price that Bob would set would be as
high as he could get away with, without alienating the clients. If
Alice sends Bob a message to be decrypted, and shells out $100,000,
then Bob (assuming he's honest) will decrypt it. It's too bad if it
turns out to be just a juicy love letter - Bob's purpose was there
to decrypt it, and not to work out the value to the customer. After
all, if it turns out that the file was actually a design to some
FTL vehicle, then setting a flat price in the negotiation phase
prevents Bob from going around and upping the price to $10,000,000.

I'm sorry - we seem to be thinking differently. The way I was thinking
was that Alice was actually giving Bob the message only, and that
Charlie (our suspected criminal) was smart enough to keep his public
key away from the office (or on a floppy disk). Of course, if Charlie
is stupid enough to leave his public key around, then Alice can send
only this key to Bob, and leave the 'naughty' message at the office.
Otherwise, Bob has only the ciphertext to go on - or possibly a bit
of plaintext, although Alice probably won't do that either.

But again, that's assuming that Alice does know what is in the
encrypted file. She (rightly) suspects that Charlie is giving stolen
goods away.... but she doesn't know that. See above. Anyway, Bob may
have other clients, and the time on his 486 is fairly precious.

Ooh.. this is a tough subject to police. It is possible that we have
a company rep (Denise - isn't alphabetical naming beautiful :-)) looking
over Bob's shoulders while he's doing his stuff, and checking that he's
not saving the information to a private file. Possibly, Bob would do the
encrypting in Denise's office. After all, he may have built in an option
that saves all information acquired to a "key ring". Denise does not want
him to do this, and makes sure that he only bring the executable file
with him. She also makes sure that no suspicious files are created .
Remember that Bob does not want to give the program to Denise - it contains
his secret special recipe for factorization, and doesn't want anyone else
to examine the program too closely.
