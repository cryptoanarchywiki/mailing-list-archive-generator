   funny think about garcia, his first time ever post on c'punx was about
   larry too......  strange times indeed when a newbie bursts on the scene
   knowing all about us

   [deleted: A January post of mine.  Ah, a fellow completist archiver...]

I got on Cypherpunks last year when Clipper was first announced; I'd
been aware of it before then due to Tim May's crossposts to the
Extropians list.  I've been lurking here since then.  I don't post
much, mainly because I don't have the time.  My offhand remark about
LD was due to having been recently watching his strange self-flaming
behavior in various newsgroups; I'd thought I'd throw out some bait to
see if he was still receiving the list somehow.

I'm decidedly not an LD "tentacle".  Call me if you like:  713-946-6249
home, 713-739-9101 work, 713-269-4382 pager...
