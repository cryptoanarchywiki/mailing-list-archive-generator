(That someone was me, folks.)

  relations (pg. 176 of the 1993 Annual Report of the CFR)

  members of this organization:

  Lloyd Cutler, Counsel to the President
  George Stephanopoulos, Senior Advisor
  David Gergen, Assistant to the President for Communications

  Samuel R. Berger, Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security
  Adm. William Crowe, Jr., Chairman, Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board
  John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy
  Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, Chief of Staff, Army     \

Compared to your typical high government official, David
Sternlight is a genius.  Indeed if they were all as smart
as he is, I would be slightly worried - but only very
slightly.  :-)
