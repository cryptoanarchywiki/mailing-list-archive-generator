I have a completely different attitude towards mega-buck lotteries.  I  
seem them as a form of entertainment.   For less than the price of a two  
hour movie, I can purchase a ticket that is good for a few days of  
daydreaming.

Yes, I admit it, although the rational portion of my brain understands the  
odds against winning are mostly zero, there still exists a portion of my  
brain that says "sure, but mostly zero means partly non-zero".  I derive  
pleasure from the daydreams of instant wealth that mega-buck lotteries  
make possible.  Therefore, for me, it's not money down the drain.

	"That the arguments they are hearing about American companies

What's the official government form I need to fill out to prove loss of  
revenue from an inability to export a version of our product that was  
never produced since we knew in advance we would not be able to export it?
