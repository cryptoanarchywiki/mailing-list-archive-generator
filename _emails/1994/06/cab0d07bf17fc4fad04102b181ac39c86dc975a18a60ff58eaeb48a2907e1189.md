C'punks,

"Acapulco H.E.A.T." was hip deep in crypto again this week.  This time 
the Team was trying to bust *drug trafficers* (bad, bad drug lords).  For 
some reason, my favorite character, "Cat" (Alison Armitage) got herself 
into a school for women drug operative recruited by the trafficers.  We 
got to see lots of scenes of Cat and other nubiles jogging, doing jumping 
jacks, push ups and, best of all, shooting strange large caliber 
automatic weapons.

The crypto part?  Oh, yeah, right.  Anyway, the trafficers (ex-KGB types) 
were transmitting date, time and location information to associates in 
Miami.  Communications was via a series of numbers read in the clear over 
shortwave radio.  For some reason, the H.E.A.T. guys new that the "key" 
was a ten-digit number that was the *same* every time!  Since the KGB guy 
had once been busted by the CIA, H.E.A.T. finally guessed that the key 
was the CIA's phone number.  No kidding.

There was some other minor computer stuff, but the important values were 
preserved:  Alison and other babes did callisthenics, there was lots of gun 
play and Fabio did *not* "act" in this episode.

Tune in next--same H.E.A.T.-time, same H.E.A.T.-channel--for the further 
crypto adventures of "Acapulco H.E.A.T."
