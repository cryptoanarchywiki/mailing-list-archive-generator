	According to Tommy <nobody@soda.berkeley.edu>
	  David Sternlight is a member of the council on foreign
	  relations (pg. 176 of the 1993 Annual Report of the CFR)
	 
	  The following Executive Branch officials are also 
	  members of this organization:
	 
	  William J. Clinton, President
	etc etc...

The CFR is a politicans equivalent of the rotary club and something
you get into in exchange for little more than a few of the green
folding ones.  Everyone and his dog is in it - the membership must
be in the tens if not hundreds of thousands.  Basically it's like
an English 'Gentleman's Club' - you're paying for the snob value
of membership.  What they get out of it is a big party cum picnic
at somewhere posh once a year (like Camp David) and the chance to
schmooze with the nobs.  They disguise this on their tax claims
as a policy conference.

Membership marks Sternlight as a social climber, not as a mover
and shaker.
