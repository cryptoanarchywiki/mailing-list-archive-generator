	I'm sorry if I missed the beginning of the thread and am
off-topic:

	(but I may as well promote what I've written anyway =)

	The blind anonymous server that I've written which is running
on omega.c2.org can facilitate the creation of a mailing list for
which all the members are anonymous. The maintainer of the list merely
needs to create an "identity" for the list and add as "paths" back to
the identity encrypted blocks pointing to the people who are
subscribed to the list. (Thus the maintainer of the list doesn't need
to know the email addresses of people subscribed..)
	Mail sent to the list can just be sent to the identity's alias
at omega.c2.org, and if the "spraymode" option is on then mail will go
out to everyone on the list.
	See http://www.c2.org/services/blindserver.html for more
information.
