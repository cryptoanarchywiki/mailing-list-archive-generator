Oooh.  Thank you, Tim.  This is exactly the kind of response I'd half hoped
for, and didn't think I'd get.  I was hoping someone HAD seen Sternlight, and
that he hadn't just been out of town or something.  It cheers me that he is
around but not prodding people on newsgroups that I am interested in.  There's
hope that his crypto-noise will die down, then.

I don't always disagree with him, either, but I don't like what the results are
once he takes a position on a news group.  Once, I talked (via email) him into
not posting to sci.crypt, for no other reason than because there were people
who had an emotional investment in putting him down, and the resulting 
arguments had nothing to do with sci.crypt.


Hmm.  As an attempt to legitimize this note in the crypto sense, does anyone
have an opinion as to whether or not I should upgrade the version of PGP I'm
using for the remailer@rebma.mn.org?  I'm using 2.3a, currently.
