It is indeed a great achievement to best the NSA at its own game. This hack 
allows secure transmission and closes the LEAF backdoor. However, this only 
strengthens my belief that they don't really need this LEAF access, can you 
say trapdoor? I still wouldn't be sending anything I wanted to keep a secret
using TESSERA, even with a newly generated LEAF field. I'd wager that Matt 
wouldn't either.
