YOUR letters, faxes and calls are needed now to ensure that the
cryptography, privacy and security provisions of the Cantwell Export
Administration Act are preserved in bill HR3837 - help strike a blow
against Clipper and for freely distributable software like PGP and RIPEM.
If you can't fax directly, you can send your message to glickman@eff.org. 
EFF will fax or hand-deliver it for you to the Committee Chair, Rep. Dan
Glickman.


Updates on the Fax numbers of the House Intelligence Committee.

 Subcommittee fax:    +1 202 225 1991   
Sometimes does not answer. Keep trying!  it IS a working fax number.
 
        Rep                       phone           fax

 D KS Glickman, Daniel         +1 202 225 6216   +1 202 225 5398    Chair
Rep. Glickman's staff has finally released his fax number.


 D TX Coleman, Ronald D.       +1 202 225 4831   +1 202 225 4831 
This fax number is also a voice line.  Staff manually switch to fax if they
hear fax tones.  You may wish to call by voice to make sure they do this
if your fax attempts fail.   If you don't get thru, call the Committee, and
ask for the voice number, it may have been changed.

 D AL Cramer Jr, Robert (Bud)  +1 202 225 4801   +1 202 225 4392
Rep. Cramer's staff has finally released his fax number.

 D MO Gephardt, Richard A.     +1 202 225 2671   +1 202 225 7414
Rep. Gephardt has changed his fax number.  The correct one is given here.

 R NE Bereuter, Douglas        +1 202 225 4806   +1 202 226 1148 
Sometimes does not answer.  This IS a valid fax #, keep trying.

 R CA Dornan, Robert K.        +1 202 225 2965   
Rep. Dornan has disconnected this fax number.  His office does have a fax,
but it has been made non-public.  Constituents may wish to describe to Rep.
Dornan how they feel about such manouvers.

 R IL Michel, Robert H.        +1 202 225 6201   +1 202 225 9249 
Try again if you don't get an answer.  This is a working fax number.


Many thanks to Janet E. Harrison <tat@well.sf.ca.us> for doing the footwork
for this update.
