One thing of note from the book on Crypto 92, is that the conference
occurred in August.  The paper on fair crypto systems contains references
to President Clinton and Clipper, having been written or revised between May
and August of 93.

Hardly seems fair for something supposedly presented (and reviewed in
92).  Is it just me or does this seem questionable?  (Possibly being an
attempt to show prior art, or perhaps being simply revised by someone
close to the publication process.)
