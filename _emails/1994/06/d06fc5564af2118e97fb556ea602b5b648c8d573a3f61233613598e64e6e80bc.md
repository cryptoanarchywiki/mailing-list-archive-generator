[story deleted]

I had something similiar happen.  Last week, I moved all of my stuff from 
my old address to this one.  I unsubscribed from cypherpunks and 
resubscribed over here.  Then the crash happened.   I resubscribed from 
here, and then Eric restored the backups, so I was now subscribed twice.  
I unsubscribed from my old account and lost both of them (majordomo can 
do some funky domain checking) and had to resubscribe from my new 
workstation.  Annoying but understandable.

The 'funky' domain checking that Majordomo does is so that if you are on 
terminal1.domain.foo.bar, it will assume that a user with the same name 
at terminal2.domain.foo.bar is the same and tell you you are already 
subscribed and if there are two entries, remove them both.
