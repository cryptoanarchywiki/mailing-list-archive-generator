This part of the audience is certainly not receptive.  I'm here to
discuss crypto and its implications, not to have my mailbox filled with
adverts.

Keep the spam off.  Unordered e-mail advertising (beyond a pointer to
where to find more info) is indeed bad.  If I wanted to read that guff in
its entirety, I would have checked the Web, gophers, or FTP sites, etc.
