As I read it, he simply asked (and quite nicely at that) if such
a algorithm might exist, and asked if there were any references
to it in the literature.  Now clearly he was hoping that such a
mechanism might offer the opportunity to binary search the key
space efficiently and perhaps those hopes were misplaced, but I
don't think the idea was so off the wall as to be deserving of
the ridicule you heaped upon it.  Far weirder things have been
proposed on this list.

I think the key word here is "might."  Hope springs eternal, even
in cryptology. :)
