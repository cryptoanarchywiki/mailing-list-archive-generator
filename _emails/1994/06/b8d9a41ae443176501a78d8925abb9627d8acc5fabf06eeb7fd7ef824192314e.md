Yes, I found it distorted.  My question for John Markoff, if he would be
kind enough to answer, is:  is "traditional" his word, or was it his
source's?  If source's, was source DoJ, or White House?

IMO, police wiretapping usurped a power forbidden to it by the Fourth.  To
call usurped power "traditional" is pretty smarmy.
