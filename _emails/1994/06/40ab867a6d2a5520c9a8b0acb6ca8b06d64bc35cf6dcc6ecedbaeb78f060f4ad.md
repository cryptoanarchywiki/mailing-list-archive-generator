Really.  And what's more: when the Colombian drug lord was located
via his cellular use, the story was that the NSA had to bring special
equipment into the country to do the tracking.  That doesn't wash here.
It looks like at least some switches in Amerika are already equipped
to read out locations for individual phones.  They probably don't even
have to wait for you to make a call - they can call you, or even use
the phone's automatic pings.
