Decline and Fall of the Nation State:

Tuesday's WSJ had an article on how private money market funds are 
starting to jawbone foreign governments just like the World Bank used to.

Case cited was Fidelity Investments calling Mexican bank officials during 
the Peso crisis after the recent assasination.  They said "we'll invest 
another $18 billion (of ours and other fund's money) if you do what we say 
and if not..."

DCF

"If they hadn't killed quite so many people, you'd almost have to feel 
sorry for them."
