As long as you are aware of the risks and accept them.. no
problem.  But "I don't know if he'd think of this" is hardly
cryptographically secure..

Well no.. without the secret key file, you have to factor the
public modulus to find the secret key.   We all know how are
that is..  if he already has the encrypted key file though...
then he just has to guess your password.  Far less work, unless
of course you picked a pass phrase a few hundred letters long.

In general, it is impossible to achieve total security on a
multi-user system unless you are the sysadmin yourself.  You
either have to forget it entirely or decide what risks you're
willing to take and what risks you're not.

Good luck.
