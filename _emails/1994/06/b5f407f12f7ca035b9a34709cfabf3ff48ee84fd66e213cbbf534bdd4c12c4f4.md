I don't think so.  While they now engage in this questionable practice,
I don't think they've been doing for more than 2-3 years.  If I had to
guess, I would think they only feel safe in doing so because the states
have already established a legal precedent with their lotterys.  They (the
states) would be hard pressed to make a distinction between their annuity
funded 20 year payoffs and those of Publisher's Clearing House.  Thus the 
State's corruption taints the free market.
