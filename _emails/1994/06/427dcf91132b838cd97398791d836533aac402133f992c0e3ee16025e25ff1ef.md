I was one of the 10,000 people who ordered a free copy of "A proposal for 
a Public Key Encryption System" from MIT as a result of that column.  It 
certainly guarranteed wide dissemination of the ideas.  

The real mistake that the NSA made was writing that "Publish and We'll 
Throw You in Jail" letter to RSA.  Good publicity generator.
