First of all, you behave as though time is not a factor. If it takes
five minutes to start every phone conversation you have, well, you've
just given people a big incentive not to use any encryption at all.

Second of all, all this rubble bouncing is insane. The NSA or whomever
isn't stupid. They will not attack you where you are strong -- they
will attack you where you are weak. Do YOU do all your typing in a
faraday cage? No? Then why the hell bother?

Lastly, you behave as though cost is not a factor. Well, you don't
live in the real world, then. Cost is ALWAYS a factor.
