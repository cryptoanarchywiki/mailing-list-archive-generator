I was perfectly willing to answer someone asking an honest question.
I've asked many a stupid question myself over the years because I
didn't know a field yet. The point is not that people can't ask
questions or expect polite answers -- its that I resent people who
think that now that they've been handed a rusty saw they know how to
do surgery. You didn't insist that you knew more than other people --
you said you didn't know something so I made an effort to point you at
the answer. I dislike people who are ignorant pretending to themselves
that they know what they don't.
