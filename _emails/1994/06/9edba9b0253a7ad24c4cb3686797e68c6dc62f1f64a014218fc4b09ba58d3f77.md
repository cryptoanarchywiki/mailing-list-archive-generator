Tim, if you pat me on the head any more you're likely to get fleas...

The point of my post was to discuss the merits of a proposition. That is,
WWW/Mosaic is at least a prima facie (seems like a good idea), if not de
facto (they say it works) Internet Mercantile Protocol.  *If* that's the
case, then what would be proper the action to make it happen quicker.

*If* it is possible to send money through the internet *and* receive
something in return (probably nettable.stuff like software, information,
maybe bandwidth?), *then* you have an IMP.  I think Chaum's innocent until
proven guilty.  I used the words de facto in the existential, and not the
universal, sense. I could not possibly mean everyone's using it, in light
of the fact that he just announced the stuff!

This is where I think you're fighting the last (of several) wars.  I was
*not* trying to find out if anyone around here wanted to work for free.  I
was looking for a "snicker test" of the concept that WWW/Digicash might be
an IMP, so that folks like myself could do something to make it happen if
it is. Forthwith, I hereby promise *never* to ask someone on this list to
work for free. (I'll probably regret that ;-)).

This is the first kernal of tenable argument in all the chaff of (face it,
Tim) condesention, and I agree with it.  I think getting banks - or other
people who convert money from one form to another - interested in digital
cash is something someone who doesn't code for a living could do. Points
like this were what I was looking for. Now that it can be done (as Chaum
has claimed to have demonstrated), then someone with more guts than brains
won't get laughed out of the office in the first round of due dilligence.

[much sage advice about getting people to work for free on appropriate,
scalable projects, scarce c'punk resources, and herding cats]

I'm not so sure here. If the market is for stuff like software and
information, and if the only proprietary market opportunity is at the
currency exchange level, then if a credible, (and legal) currency exchange
function is implemented on the internet, and we have a working Internet
Mercantile Protocol.  Lots of "ifs" in that line of reasoning, but they're
not hysterically unrealistic.
