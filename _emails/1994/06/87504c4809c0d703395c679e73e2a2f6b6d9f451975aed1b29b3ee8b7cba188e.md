 Sir,

 I am writing to ask you to support the encryption provisions of
H.R. 3937. The use of encryption is essential not only from a
personnal privacy standpoint, it is essential to effective economic
competitiveness. There are many companies around the world today
who defeat American companies on contracts solely because they are
able to provide more effective encryption in their products.



                                      Sincerly,



                                      Brian D Williams
                                      Ameritech Data Center

                                      Chicago, Il 60606
