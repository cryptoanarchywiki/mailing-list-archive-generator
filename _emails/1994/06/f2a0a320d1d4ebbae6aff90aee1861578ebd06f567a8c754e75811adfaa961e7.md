Just out of curiousity, how large *is* Cypherpunks?

I've been subscribed just about a week now, but I've been quite pleasantly
shocked by the S/N ratio, after getting completely turned off by the
Sternlight wars on Usenet. Ironic that a group calling themselves "punks"
should be civilized, intelligent, scholarly, altruistic, and basic good
'net citizens, while sci.crypt is often little more than a bunch of people
playing "did so!" games. And the PGP group!
