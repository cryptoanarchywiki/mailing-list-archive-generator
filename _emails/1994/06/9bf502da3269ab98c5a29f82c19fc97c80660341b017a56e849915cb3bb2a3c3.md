Once and for all we have to squaush the stupid question that leads the 
last paragraph of the NYT Magazine article:

"What if the [VoicePGP] static shielded the murderous plans of a terrorist 
or kidnapper?  Phil Zimmermann would feel terrible."  

Presumably because he is "of the Left".  Phil goes on to talk about 
tradeoffs.

The real answer is:

That's a real stupid question.  Right now in my head I could be a psycho 
killer planning all sorts of terrible stuff, does that mean that you 
should use the techniques of the Inquisition to fight crime by peeling 
back the layers of my mind?  Computers and communications are just 
extensions of the minds of individuals.  If I can keep my mind private, I 
can keep my computer private.
