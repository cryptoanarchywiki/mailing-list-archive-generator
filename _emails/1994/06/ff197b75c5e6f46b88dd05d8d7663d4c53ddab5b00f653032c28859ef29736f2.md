That's a feature, not a bug.

When your phone hears an ident message broadcast from a cell whose
system ID doesn't match the home system ID, it will emit a "here I am"
message. The foreign cell can be programmed to send a "welcome,
roamer" message, to log the entry into a file, or whatever.

Within individual systems, there's no built-in capability to follow a
phone. For example, the local BellSouth cellular operator can tell
that _right now_ my phone is in the Harvest cell, and it can later
tell that I've moved to the Decatur cell, but it won't automatically
do so unless asked.
