The implications in the field of industrial espionage leap quickly to mind.

Beyond that, unrestrained encryption is dangerous to corporations, because
what's to stop a ticked off employee from encrypting everything in the office
as revenge for some imagined slight?

Encryption as a weapon is something that's not often talked about, despite
the fact that everyone's always rambling about how valuable information
is...

The arguments for restraining encryption in corporate situations can
go on and on... just as the arguments for encouraging private encryption
can go on and on.
