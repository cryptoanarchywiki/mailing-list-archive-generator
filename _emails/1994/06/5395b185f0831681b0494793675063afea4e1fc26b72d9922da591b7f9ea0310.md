    As Netsurfer posted without comment, from Edupage 06/09/94:

E-MAIL PRIVACY
        A survey of 301 companies by Macworld Magazine showed that 78.4% of
the firms do not spy on employee e-mail or search their electronic files.
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) has drafted legislation requiring that companies
tell their workers that their e-mail might be monitored. (Tampa Tribune
6/8/94 BayLife 5) 

    If anyone has Macworld perhaps we might contact the author for
    further details.  It seems to me a startling point to be told
    that one in five email users IS being spied on.  How many more
    encryption buffs might emerge if this were common knowledge?
