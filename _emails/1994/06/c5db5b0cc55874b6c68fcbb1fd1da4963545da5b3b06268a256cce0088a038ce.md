>[about Sternlight...]
>

Someone said that Sternlight is a high-placed govt official.  I don't
believe this.  I think he is a retired old fart with a home computer
and an internet acct.

Sternlight is neurotic.  Detweiler is psychotic.

I don't think Sternlight has been a factor in this mailing list, except
that people who read the Usenet crypt groupts and comp.eff.talk.org. have
had to deal with his posts alot, and some may be assuming that everyone on
this list is quite familiar with his name.

Detweiler, and posts about Detweiler, dominated this list for awhile.  I
hope this doesn't start up again, especially about Sternlight, since he
never even posts to this list.  Unless it has something to do with
cypherpunk issues, of course.
