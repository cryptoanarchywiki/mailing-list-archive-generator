CYBERCOP 
        A former New Jersey police officer now spends his time cruising for
suspects in cyberspace and has been involved in dozens of criminal
investigations, including a sting operation that nabbed a pedophile who
lured young rape victims via a bulletin board service.  (Tampa Tribune
6/8/94 BayLife 5)

E-MAIL PRIVACY 
        A survey of 301 companies by Macworld Magazine showed that 78.4% of
the firms do not spy on employee e-mail or search their electronic files. 
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) has drafted legislation requiring that companies
tell their workers that their e-mail might be monitored. (Tampa Tribune
6/8/94 BayLife 5)

PAT ROBERTSON EYES VIETNAMESE CABLE TV  
        Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson wants to build a cable-TV
system in Vietnam and is confident a deal can be struck after meeting with
government and TV officials in Hanoi. The proposed system will use
microwave technology to beam dozens of channels to homes. (Investor's
Business Daily 6/8/94 A9)
