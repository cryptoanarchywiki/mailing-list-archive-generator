Micali's scheme could be very useful for ensuring that a secret is not
lost forever upon the death, departure, or forgetfulness of an
employee. Even Cypherpunks Inc. would probably be interested in a
crypto system that allows reconstruction of a key by some process, for
secrets belonging to the company.

Generally, a whole range of algorithms and protocols is not a bad
thing. (A similar example is a protocol for digicash that only
"allows" partial withdrawals of one's cash...why would anyone "want"
such a limiting system? Think about it.) So long as the market is able
to function, and is not distorted by coercive laws, expect various
sorts of systems.

This said, I dislike the "fair" appelation, as it seems to be a kind
of propagandizing. In this age of hype, not surprising. But very bad
if the "fair" name gets used to help make such schemes mandatory for
private citizens.

I look forward to hearing your summary, Bill! Micali's paper was
presented at the '92 Crypto Conference ("Proceedings" should be
readily available in the usual places: university libraries and large
technical bookstores, or by special order from Springer-Verlag),
around the same time Denning was describing this and other possible
"trial balloons" for key escrow.
