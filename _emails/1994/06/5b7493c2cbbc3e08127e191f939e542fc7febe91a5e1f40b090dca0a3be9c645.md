     Fairly. In fact, it's considered downright rude. It's like sitting
around a table of, say, 3 people, and whispering with someone next to you.
The first person is you -- you're sending the message. The second person
is your friend -- he's recieving it. The third is me -- I'm just watching
two people whispering. Further, newsgroups are a very inappropriate place
to send private mail for propogation.
