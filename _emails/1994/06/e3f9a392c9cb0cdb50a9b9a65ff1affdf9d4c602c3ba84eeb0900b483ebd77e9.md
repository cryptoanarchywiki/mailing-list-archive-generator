If you substitute the word "gun" for "crypto" most all of this applies to
your second amendment rights as well.

The plan seems to be to demonize and then ridicule the target group until 
the masses are convinced they are not worthy of rights.  The best known 
case:  Germany in the 30s and 40s.  The new Jew=crypto user.

Mike is exactly right when he states that every story in print or video or
radio highlights the miniscule misuse of crypto and, of course, the
Oprah generation eats it up.  Now, they do not give the relative misuse of
crypto, it must be huge or why would they report it as a problem, right?
About like the horrendous number of crimes committed with so-called
assault weapons, which on a bad day might approach 1%.

Let us not forget RICO while we're at it, talking about seizing.
