C'punks,

Thought this might be of interest to the list.  The People's Liberation 
Army seems to be on the cutting edge.

I will be in Beijing from 7th to 13th of July.

I will be teaching Cryptology and Electronic Signatures there.
I have some friends at China Embassy in Madrid that arranged me this wonderful
trip to Beijing. Of course, most of my official conferences will be for Chinesse
Army, but I am completely free to have any interview there.

At the moment, I do not know my hotel or phone number there, but I am
 interestedin any contact with people related with technology business there.

Any suggestion for me?

Thanks before hand.

Cervantes dreamed "El Quijote" close to the place where my PC is now!
