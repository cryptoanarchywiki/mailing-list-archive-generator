Enormous investment has already been made. Furthermore, the EES design
has provisions in the processor for only a 128 bit LEAF. Its hardly
clear that they can just "patch" this in a few weeks.

However, I'll note that Matt felt he had an obligation as a scientist
to reveal the flaw and even to state in his paper how to fix it
(although thats more or less obvious -- increase the checksum to 32 or
64 bits.)

I doubt that its that cut and dried. Unless they can convince congress
to undertake a major legal change to make a discredited technology
manditory, no one outside the government will use it.
