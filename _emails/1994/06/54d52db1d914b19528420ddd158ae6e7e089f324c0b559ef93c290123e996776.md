And what if they *do* prove Clipper is secure (or "great")? How would
that change the objection many of us have to the _concept_ of key
escrow? (By this I mean the likelihood of mandatory key escrow, and a
government-subsidized Clipper product family.)

In my view, any focus on the details of Clipper instead of the overall
concept of key escrow plays into their hands.

This is not to say that the work of Blaze and others is
misguided....in fact, it's very fine work. But a general focus on the
details of Skipjack does nothing to allay my concerns about
government-mandated crypto.

If it were "house key escrow" and there were missing details about the
number of teeth allowed on the keys, would be then all breathe a sigh
of relief if the details of the teeth were clarified? Of course not.

Me, I will never use a key escrow system, even if a blue ribbon panel
of hackers and Cypherpunks studies the design and declares it to be
cryptographically sound.

I say let's not lose sight of the really basic objections.
