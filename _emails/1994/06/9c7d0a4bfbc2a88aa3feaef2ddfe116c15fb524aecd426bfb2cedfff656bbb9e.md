My recollections from a brief stint with Intel in the early 80's is
that the company is quite conservative, and that Mr. Grove's personal
outlook is largely responsible.  Before I get torched, I hasten to
point out that "conservative" does not of course necessarily imply
"Clipper supporter"; there are certain statist philosophies that do so
imply, however, and some of those can be lumped into the category
"conservative".

I could be way wrong.  Perhaps Mr. May could add more.  It is
distressing (though not surprising) to know that there are individuals
in positions of power in cyberspace-related industries who hold
opinions antithetical to "ours".
