As Russell says, this is a web site. Actually, it isn't. The archive is not
a web, in that it isn't the ideal hypertexted dream we all have. But it does
have an extensive index, through wais. If you want to search for something
in particular, you can try (with a URL browser, like lynx/mosaic)
  wais://pmipii.dist.maricopa.edu:210/crypt/Cypherpunks.src?remailer

I forget the path, it'll show up when you try the http; the ? after the 
filename is followed by a wais search string, such as 'remailer'. You should
be able to use a wais client to access this.

I don't know how _old_ the archive is...
