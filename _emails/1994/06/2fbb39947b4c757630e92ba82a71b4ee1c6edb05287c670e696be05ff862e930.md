Rather than spending effort developing technology for self-protection,  
wouldn't it be better to spend effort developing a society in which  
self-protection is unnecessary?  Think of all the energy and resources  
that would be saved if people just got along.  I think the cypherpunks  
should redirect their efforts into the fields of genetics and human  
behavior.  Better people make a better world.  A committee should be  
formed to develop specifications describing a good person.  The committee  
could then launch a program to guide society to a future where everyone  
met or exceeded the recommended specifications.  The project would include  
frequent quality assurance testing to guarantee rapid convergence to the  
desired goals.  Individuals who did not meet the specifications would be  
removed from the program.
