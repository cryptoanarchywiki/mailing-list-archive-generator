- From "Intellectual Property: Patents, Trademarks, and Copyright in a
Nutshell", pp 12-13, Miller & Davis, West Pub., 1990. (not a particularly 
authoritative cite, but it ought to do)

"During the life of the patent, the owner has the complete right to 
determine who, if anybody, will have the right to use, make, or sell
the patented item, 35 USCA (s) 261, and to a more limited extent, how or
where it will be initially exploited. It is important to understand that
American law does not require the patentee to put the patent into use or
allow others to do so. The first requirement, of putting the patent into
use, is called 'working' the patent, a requirement with some historical
meaning and considerable foreign patent law significance. The second
requirement, of allowing others to use the patent, is called 'compulsory
licensing.' Like working, there is no absolute American requirement of
compulsory licensing, but other aspects of the law, especially antitrust,
may have the effect of obliging a patent owner to license others to use
the patent."
