Wrongo...the random time stamp does randomly re-order then. As to bogus
messages, not on my system you won't....

I have a system which runs of a SLIP feed and bandwidth is sacrosanct.
If you would like to pay for an additional line to handle the added 
load then fine but my pocket book won't support it. And when one makes
the consideration of the future where there will be many small systems
with minimal bandwidth and monetary resources then I realy doubt they 
will be interested in any system which slows down or otherwise wastes
a precious and critical resource.

I also oppose the implied synchronicity of your methods as well. I am 
looking at a resonably secure asynchronouse method of making the 
traffic analysis difficult (the real reason for all this mumbo jumbo
in the first place). Why should I provide a potential monitor with the
information that a certain amount of information going out will be 
bogus? This also relates to my comments concerning the use of the other
'feed' systems around me.

You obviously don't pay all the costs for your feed or else you are very 
rich...
