Sure, I know that Qualcomm could easily justify having the toys around
the place. But what would I say to the cops/FCC when they came knocking?
I was just waiting to get the capital together to set up a phone manufacturing
program? Is there any legitimate use for someone not in the business? 

The best I can come up with is: a wife who wants to track her husbands
progress home so she knows when to throw the steaks on the grill. ("He
always arrives 12 minutes after the he moves into our cell.")
