I assume 'rouge' is a typo - Matt's paper was talking about
rogue units, rather than Commies or makeup-artists :-)

One weakness in the weakness is that most Clippersystems
appear to be designed to use the same session key in each direction,
so both ends have to be privacy-protected versions to prevent
wiretapping, since a non-rogue LEAF from either end will give away the key.

But it's a good start, and ought to be exploited for all the
political mileage we can get out of it.... and it's not surprising
that security in a conversation is everybody's job...
