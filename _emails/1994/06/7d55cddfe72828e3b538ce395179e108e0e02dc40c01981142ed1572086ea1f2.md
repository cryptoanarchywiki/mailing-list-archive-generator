Is a possibility...especially since I can find no reference to it
or why it won't work.

This is a joke right? Why in the world should the base have a damn thing
to do with the algorithm? A number is a number last time I checked.

any algorithm that did that would have to involve none of the basic

Sorry, I don't follow your reasoning here at all. Could you clarify?

As far as I am concerned if it could be done w/ a neural network, or
boolean algebra (course if no arithmetic ops no logic I guess), or
even a fuzzy algorithm (the original impetus to this line, I was looking
at "close enough" algorithms for a robot project I am in the middle of.
) would be ok by me. 

Seems to me though that if one looks at the results of the operation one 
could glean some sort of magnitude info out of the errors...
