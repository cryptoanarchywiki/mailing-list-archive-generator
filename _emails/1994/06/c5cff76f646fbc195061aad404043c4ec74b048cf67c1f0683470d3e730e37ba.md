 For a group to comit conspiracy they have to actually do something other than
just talk about it. For example, you and I are discussing robbing a bank over
lunch, nothing illegal about that. However(!), the instant you say "lets use
my car" or "I have a gun we can use" then you have committed conspiracy.

It is my understanding that conspiracy is a felony even if the crime is a    
misdemeanor...
