Well, the concrete evidence thus far is that they are ahead of us.

Sure. However, ten billion dollars spent at only 25% efficiency is
still 2.5 billion dollars. They have plenty of money, and EXTREMELY
smart people. Bob Morris isn't a weenie. Neither are any of the other
NSAoids I know of. That, and the concrete evidence that they are
probably twenty years ahead of us, leads me to believe that it is
stupid to underestimate them.
