This is a bit of SMTP foolishness.  Some applications put
greater-than/less-than brackets around the address, like this:
RCPT TO:<cypherpunks@toad.com>  and some don't, ie:
RCPT TO:cypherpunks@toad.com

Some SMTP implementations refuse to accept one or the other format.
It's not a very common problem, but it happens occasionally, especially with
older versions.
