I do not contend this, I contend they were negligent in checking their work.
That they were lax in their standards and that this lackadaisical attitude 
bespeakes arrogance. An arrogance that would allow them to think that they 
COULD put in a trapdoor (besides the LEAF) in Skipjack and easily get away 
with it.

It would be in the NSA's self interest to have there own little door into 
Skipjack, wouldn't you say? Especially when the agency is quite satisfied 
that no one knows their algorithm. I don't see the evidence you are operating 
on, but will grant you the self interest part I mentioned above.

Well, they did say so. But, I did agree with the play down mistakes position 
in the last post.
