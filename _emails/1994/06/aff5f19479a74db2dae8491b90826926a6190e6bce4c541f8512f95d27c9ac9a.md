So you've said. However,
1) If you had, anything interesting you could say would be classified,
   you'd have a clearance, and you'd go to jail for mentioning it.
2) you've shown every sign of being fairly clueless. 

I'll point out as an example the fact that you don't understand
initialization vectors, and this gem:

Huh? Have you been paying attention? I have no idea what on earth the
"control program" is, but Matt's work certainly has nothing to do with
any such thing...

And this gem:

Ahem. What the hell are you talking about? Tessera has no concept of
"crypto synchronization" or the detection thereof.
