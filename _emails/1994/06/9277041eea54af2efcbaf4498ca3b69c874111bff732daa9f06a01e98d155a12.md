today's topic on Which Way LA (KCRW 89.9FM, Los Angeles) was on phone,
computer, etc.  privacy, and how the government is doing everything it can
to take it away from us.  at least that's what the spots have said.
presumably about clipper, FBI wiretap laws, etc.  first broadcast was at
13:00 but i missed it, being rebroadcast at 19:00.

i don't have a tape deck in my office, but i guess i could digitize it.
sorry for all of you outside LA, which is probably 99.3598% of you... :)
