Well, I've played with stealth briefly, along with a few other
interesting utilities, and it does look good.  i.e. there is no
way to validate proper messages.  If you feed
noise/junk/whatever into stealth, it will give you a pgp encoded
message back.  Every picture posted to alt.binaries.pictures.*
could be run through stealth and a pgp file would result.  Find
which ones *really* were pgp files to begin with.. good luck..

What we have to worry about is making sure there is no way to
identify the data that pgp puts out itself.  That is, the
encrypted data and the encrypted IDEA key.  If I gave you random
samples of noise and told you that one of them was an IDEA key
encrypted by an RSA key, you shouldn't be able to pick it out.
