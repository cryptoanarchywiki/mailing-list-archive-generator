DES defines a family of fucntions defined by the keys, call them E_k,
that map the 64 bit integers one to one into the 64 bit integers. That
is, no two plaintexts produce the same cyphertext. Therefore, you
don't need all possible combinations of keys -- any key will produce
all possible cyphertexts if you chain through all possible plaintexts.

Given any two distinct keys, k_1 and k_2, it is pretty much guaranteed
that there are at the very least plenty of cyphertexts C_1=E_k_1(P_1)
such that there is a C_2=E_k_2(P_2) with C_1 = C_2 and P_1 != P_2.
