Hmmm. I just tried and was unable to reproduce your problem. I created a
secret keyring which contained two keys. MacPGP2.6 happily let me select
either one. How did you wind up with two keys? Did MacPGP generate them
both or did you import one (or both) of them? What actually happens when
you attempt to use the one that MacPGP doesn't want to use?

P.S. We might want to move this conversation to pgp-bugs@mit.edu
