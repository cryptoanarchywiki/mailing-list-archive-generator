Perry, I don't know the probability of oxygen atoms moving to Japan
or anywhere else. (who said Japan was the wrong side of the planet)
And, I don't think that anyone will attack my keys by brute force.

I do think that someone will be trying to crack messages on a random
basis. That is by trying IDEA keys with otherwise idle cpu time on a
large base of message trafic. (not my one little pathetic message).
Given estimates that the IDEA algorithem is equivlent to a
3000-bit rsa key. I am bringing the rsa part of PGP up to par with
the IDEA part of PGP. (just hitting on the weakest link first)

So, call me paranoid or joe, I will strive to reach MY crypto comfort
level. And that seems to be a higher level of crypto than you have.
Who cares !
Use whatever crypto you want.
