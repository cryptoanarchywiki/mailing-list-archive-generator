    They came for the Jews,
    and I was silent because I was not a Jew;
    They came for the Trade Unionists,
    and I did not protest, because I did not
    belong to a trade union;
    They came for the Catholics, and I said nothing
    because I was not a Catholic;
    And then they came for me.
    There was no one left to say anything...

So, why'd you "forget" the start of the quote??

In Germany they first came for the Communists, and I didn't speak up because I
wasn't a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because
I wasn't a Jew.  Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up
because I wasn't a trade unionist.  Then they came for the Catholics, and I
didn't speak up because I was a Protestant.  Then they came for me -- and by
that time no one was left to speak up.
