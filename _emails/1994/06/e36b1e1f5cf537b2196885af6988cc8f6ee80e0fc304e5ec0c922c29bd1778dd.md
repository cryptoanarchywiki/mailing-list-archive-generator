	 Since when can the government patent its work? I thought that works
	 produced by government agencies could not be copyrighted or patented.

The government can patent things, but not copyright them.

	 In any case, they cannot refuse to license a patent, so this isn't
	 real protection anyway. (The hope behind people patenting things they
	 may release in the future is to make it commercially less attractive,
	 not to utterly prevent use.)

Why can't they refuse to license a patent?
