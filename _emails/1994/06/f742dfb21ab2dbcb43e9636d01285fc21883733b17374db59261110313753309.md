Deja vu, anyone? Maybe Brett didn't see this and the long thread that followed
it on this list. Maybe whoever it was who posted a second copy of the latest
EFFector hadn't caught it the first time. Since I, and probably most of us, 
subscribe to EFFector, this was the _third_ copy that appeared in two days.

This sort of thing keeps happening. Now I'm not complaining ;) and would be
the last to want some centralized distribution of such material. But since
Stanton posts everything from the EFF anyway, why don't we leave it to him?
Ideally we'd have one poster for each of these publications (EFF, CPSR, 
WIRED...)

Another thing: when I archive posts or forward them elsewhere, I keep the
Subject, From, To, Cc, and Date lines in the header intact. That way, when a 
cpunk post migrates to alt.abuse.recovery, no one will repost it here.
