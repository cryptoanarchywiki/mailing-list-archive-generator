Coincidentally, or maybe not, a fellow named Ralph Stokes 
(Ralph.Stokes@f1611.n375.z1.fidonet.org) has been mentioning 
"you-know-who" by name all over the net in his now infamous 
"Beware of Roman Catholic Corruption" spam, and accusing all 
matter of people of being in league with him.

You don't suppose that, with Sternlight's disappearance and 
Stokes' appearance that ... nah, forget it...
