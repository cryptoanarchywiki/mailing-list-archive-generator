C'punks,

Well, I think we've beaten the "natural rights vs. legislated rights" 
horse too long.  Since Eric raised my consciousness about the purpose of 
this list, hopefully I can help put this old nag to merciful death.

For the purposes of this list, it is *irrelevant* whence right arise.  
Whether "privacy" is a right, a privilege or whatever, Cypherpunks 
want it.  We are in the business of securing privacy by whatever means 
are practical.  To a large degree this means via technology, but we'll 
graciously accept political solutions if they work.

No matter what side you of the "natural rights" question you are on, as a
Cypherpunk, you still want privacy.  Please let's drop this divisive,
time-consuming debate and get back to the code-writing work at hand.  
With courage and technology, we can have the privacy we want irrespective 
of what "they" have in mind for us.


 S a n d y
