I have a hack in C for the PC that does trigraphic counting a la Sinkov.
It is just a hack, without documentation, and limited to a file that
is smaller than a 80x86 segment.  But if there is interest in it, I
can make it available.

Trigraphic counting, BTW, is the way to go.  Helps reveal repeated
sequences.  The same counting gives you your more normal stats too.
