	Understood, but its not a matter of addressing 90% or the
other 10%, its a matter of "Is the security gain in building a card
that only hands out each number once worth cutting out 10% of the
market?"  I think that if you are worried about rouge code on your
machine, you aren't going to run on  a computer that can't protect its
memory from random browsing.  (I can still access all of a PC's memory
from normal code, can't I?)  Thus, building a PC card doesn't really
afford you a gain in security if I can use my hostile code to read
PGP's memory locations.  If you agree with that, then there is no good
reason not to build a serial port dongle, and include me in your
potential customers. :)
