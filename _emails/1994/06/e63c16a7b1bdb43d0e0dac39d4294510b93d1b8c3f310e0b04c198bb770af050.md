Of the several problems stated above, I find the pricing protocol
the easiest to deal with. There are a few things that need to be
known. For example, what is the complexity of Bob's algorithm? Does
it do it in polynomial time or (even better) some variant of logarithmic
time? The cost should bear relation to this fact. The cost should also
be related to the number of bytes in the message. If Bob was canny
enough, he probably would set the price P (in $ or DM or Magic Money or
any other currency I'm grouping under the title "cypherbucks") to be:

			P = F(KB) * L * D

where K (in bits) is the length of the key, L (in bytes) is the length of
the message, D (in cypherbucks/bytes) is the "decoding" cost, B (in
cypherbucks/bits) is the "factoring" cost for the key, and F is a function
from the set of cypherbucks amounts to itself that is proportional to
the complexity of Bob's algorithm. If the algorithm is logarithmic, F should
be logarithmic. If the algorithm takes O(n^2) time, F should be O(n^2); and
so on.

	There are other choices for deriving P; one such is:

			P = F(KB) + (L * D)

and of course others can make their own up. Of course, it is assumed that
Bob is operating as a monopoly, and can set whatever pricing policy he
pleases. For example, 20% discount for students and unemployed. He could
even barter for goods ("I'll decode this 100K message for one of your 
Cray computers.") If the monopoly disappears, the price would be driven
down.

	Alas, I can't say anymore at the moment. Study beckons. :-(
I hope this was of some help.
