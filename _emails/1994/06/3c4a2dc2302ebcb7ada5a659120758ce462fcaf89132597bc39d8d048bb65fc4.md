	Very amusing... Especially the compiler hack thing... It sounds 
like Ken Thompson's infamous "login:" compiler.
	The mention of the Trilateral Commission and the Bilderberg 
Committee makes me think it's a SubGenius / Illuminati joke. Those are 
two of their fave 'fronts for the Illuminati'. That and the Council for 
Foreign Relations [ Hear that, David Sternlight? ].

	One question: What's MJ12? British Intelligence was still MI5, 
right?
