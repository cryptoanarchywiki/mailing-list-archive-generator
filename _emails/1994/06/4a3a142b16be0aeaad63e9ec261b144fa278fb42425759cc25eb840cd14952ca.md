I think some people are misinterpreting the situation.  The case
of DSS is atypical, because RSADSI doesn't hold a patent on DSS.
They hold another patent which they claim can be stretched to
cover DSS; NIST's and ATT's lawyers apparently disagree.

This is different from, say, using RSA.  They hold a patent which
does quite clearly cover RSA.
