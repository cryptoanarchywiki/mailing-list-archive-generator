Subject: remailer exposing sender
Message-ID: <9406142031.AA21960@debbie.telos.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


I am concerned about a the security of using a remailer
such as remailer@soda.berkeley.edu. My concern is that
after an anonymous message has been sent or posted.
Someone could then send a message to the sender using
the encrypted address supplied by the remailer. This
message which is sent back through the remailer could
be composed of known text which then could be traced
back to the originator system of the anonymous sender.
Any comments would be appreciated.
				thanks, tom
