     Ah, the "Deep Throat" Theory... I was waiting to see how long this
would take the surface. I agree. Something _very_ unsavory is happening
here, but I doubt we'll find out what it is. If I had to guess (and this
is VERY uninformed, as far as wild speculation), someone in the NSA with
the Power To Do So, said that they would blatantly ignore the rules, and
consider all crypto their private little hunting grounds. Being as the NSA
probably is used in some Intelligence work, and lots of other things the
Government Hopes We Don't Find Out About, Congress probably ran the other
way, as it was in Their Best Interests.

     Of course, this is wild speculation. It could just be that the
Director of the NSA makes one hell of a matzah ball soup, and they didn't
want to lose the saturday afternoon Matzah Ball 'Fests... ;-)
