Someone told me that Gen Burns, the libertarian syndicated talk show 
host, was supposed to focus on Clipper a few days ago but was missing a 
guest so he may do it at some time in the very near future.  Perhaps 
today.  Those interested should listen in.  He does one topic per 
three-hour show so it could be good.
