Why should I trust them at all? Why should I willingy become an occomplice
in any of their activities? I don't anyone, including me, being able to 
figure out what is going on. But more importantly you seem to assume that
these pair of communicators are not trying to determine something about me
with their traffice. By encrypting the outgoing the reciever is shure that
it came from my re-mailer and not somebody else. If the sender wants to 
be shure the reciever can verify it is from them they can use their own set
of keys to pass the encrypted traffic. With this technique they can be shure
that the remailer they intended to handle it did so correctly as well as the
original source.

Really? Exactly what are you sending that 24 hrs makes a damn as far as the
reciever getting it? If it is that time critical you aren't going to use a 
public re-mailer anyway, too unreliable. With a public re-mailer there is
no guarantee that I don't keep a image of the original and go ahead and
pass along a image. I think usefulness is something we each have to decide 
on. If it works for me and not for you that means absolutely nothing.
If others won't use it, fine by me. I run my system for me and a close
group of associates, if other callers (it is open to the public) find it
inconvenient or strange, too bad. Let them spend their own money and time
and build something exactly like they want.

Well I intend for it to use pseudonyms (ie ravage) for this sort of stuff.
I will create a libary of rules (probably in REXX) that will generate a 
list of names on demand. I really don't find 'anonxxxxx' that interesting.
The users will be able to either select their 'nym or else can generate it
for them.

Unfortunately I don't have control over the traffic on these other systems,
and I suspect most other sysadmins don't either. The bottem line is that
if all a spook looks at is my system I can hide the traffic. If they 
include in their analysis the 'surrounding' systems then I am out of luch
unless they also take active measures to hide their traffic patterns. The 
problem I see with this is who pays for it? I spend a couple hundred a 
month on my systems feeds and such, this is a tidy chunk of change out of
my pocket (I work at a community college) and I suspect few people will
find such expenses worth the effort. Also since my feed is a SLIP bandwidth
is at a premium, bogus packets are not something I will spend a lot of time
generating. In a network of mailers like I envision the layers of encryption
is what provides the protection along w/ the 'nyms.
