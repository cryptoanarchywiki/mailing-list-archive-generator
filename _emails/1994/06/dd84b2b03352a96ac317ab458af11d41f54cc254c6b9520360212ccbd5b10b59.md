Cf. Miron Cuperman's "pool" system. Subscribers get _all_ messages in
pools, decrypting only the ones they can. Others who also subscribe
can only tell that all messages went to all subscribers...ironically,
more "loggers" help increase the identity diffusity.

As above, it doesn't matter. End to end encryption makes such logging
fruitless (unless the number of pool subscribers is very small, for
obvious reasons).

A bad idea. Pools have major diffusivity advantages over any scheme
involving requested access. (Unless requestor takes _all_ messages, in
which case the ftp access is merely a wrinkle on how the pool is
subscribed to.)

Not an issue. Anon remailer chains make posting to a pool secure and
untraceable (usual caveats). Likewise, subscription to all messages
hides which are being decrypted.

To see this, think of the Cypherpunks list as one large (by today's
standards) message pool. (This is the proximate cause of this thread,
as someone is complaining about this group being used as a pool to
send anon messages to others.)
