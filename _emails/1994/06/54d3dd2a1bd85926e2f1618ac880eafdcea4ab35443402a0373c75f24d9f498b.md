I could not find this anywhere, so I will torture you all again...

In the RSA FAQ, it states how one can set up a server to do time and date
stamping of documents, but I know of no Internet service that will
do this.

Is there a way I can send a document to some agency/server and have it
time and date stamped with their public key?

Thanks in advance,
