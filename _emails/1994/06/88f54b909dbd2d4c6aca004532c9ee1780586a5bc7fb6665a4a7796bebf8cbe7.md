Has anyone successfully obtained a copy of the software for David
Chaum's DigiCash system?  He has it for sale on his Web page at
http://digicash.support.nl/ but apparently it can only be
purchased with electronic money.

A classic chicken and egg situation. :)

I sent him some mail but so far have not gotten a reply.
