If eating cheesecake makes you happppy then the Constitution says you have
an inalienable right to it. This of course implies that  your expression of 
that right does not infringe on others.

All rights are natural rights. Your assumptio that governments arent natural
(for people) is cleary one based in unclear thinking. People are social animals
and their creation of governments is a natural expression of this. All rights
are natural.

Wrong, one has to be able to clearly define those rights prior to writing
them down. At least for me I have the thought and then write it down, not
the other way around.

Wrong again, the right will happen when people decide to include it in the
Constitution, The document does not change under its own volition. The 
state can be changed under the constitution if enough people say they 
wanted it changed to cover a particular right. This is why the states
have the right to change the Constitution w/o Congressional approval. You
simply need to get the requisite number of states to agree to it.

As to freedom of the press, it was free until the English started trying
to regulate it. The people here felt that was an untold intrusion of 
any government into the actions of men.

Seems to me that a implicit assumption in  your argument is that the
actions of governments supercede the rights of man. I ask  you to explain
whey the Constitution goes to great expense to detail and explain the
rights of men and how they are decided (see Article  9, 10) and the fact
that the state is given NO rights at all...
