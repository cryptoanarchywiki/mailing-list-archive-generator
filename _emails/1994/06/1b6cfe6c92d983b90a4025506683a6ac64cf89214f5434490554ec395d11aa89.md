## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}From: Matthew Ghio <ghio@kaiwan.com>
Date: Sat, 4 Jun 94 02:05:05 PDT
To: cypherpunks@toad.com
Subject: Software upgrades to my anonymous remailer ghio@kaiwan.com
Message-ID: <ghio26160@kaiwan.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


I added PGP support to my remailer.  For those not familiar with the format,
send mail to ghio@kaiwan.com, and on the first two lines of the message body,
put:

::
Encrypted: PGP

Then put the PGP encrypted message here.  Inside the PGP message, put:

::
Anon-To: <address@site>

##
Subject: whatever
Reply-To: or any other headers that you want to add to the message

The message body of the message to be remailed goes here.



The remailer now also supports a way to truncate the message.  This will
allow you to remove your signature.  Put a header Cutmarks: in your message
with what you want to use as a truncate line.  For example:

To: ghio@kaiwan.com
Subject: Anonymous Mail

::
Request-Remailing-To: address@site
Cutmarks: -truncate_here-

this is a message
all of this text will get remailed.

-truncate_here-

this text will not be included in the remailed message.


You can also use the cutmarks feature as a boundry between seperate messages.
To use it in this manner, you must put a :: and remailing instructions
immediately following the cutmarks.  For example:

To: ghio@kaiwan.com

::
X-Anonymously-To: joe@nowhere.edu
Cutmarks:-+-next-+-

##
Subject: hi joe

this is some anonymous mail

-+-next-+-
::
X-Anon-To: beth@somewhere.edu
Cutmarks: [END]

##
Subject: Hi, Beth

look this is anonymous! :)

[END]
- Here is my .sig which will get removed -



Additional notes & common problems:

The :: must go on the very first line of the message, or immediately after
the seperator/cutmarks.

The :: is for commands/headers that you want to give to the remailer
software.  Anything that can be put following the :: can also be put in the
regular headers.  The ## is for headers that you want to appear in the output
message.

When you use PGP, all the original headers get deleted, so you must put the
Subject inside the PGP message if you want one.

Messages seperated by cutmarks are treated as seperate mail messages.  Each
must have its own cutmarks header if you want to use cutmarks in the next
message.

Only one recipient may be specified per message.  This may be inconvienient,
but it was necessary to prevent Detweiler exponentiation.
