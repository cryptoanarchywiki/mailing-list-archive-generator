MOTOROLA UNVEILS 3-WAY CHIP, SNAGS HONG KONG CONTRACT   
        Motorola's new MC68356 chip combines a microprocessor, a
digital-signal processor, and a special communications processor, all on a
single sliver of silicon. The three-way chip will be used in
credit-card-sized high-speed modems, cellular telephone equipment and
automobile guidance systems. (Wall Street Journal 6/20/94 B8) Meanwhile,
Motorola's been hired to build a $40 million high-speed wireless computing
network in Hong Kong. A trial run of the network, operating at 19.2 K bits
per second, is planned for later this year. (Investor's Business Daily
6/20/94 A14)


  This would be a nice little package to include PGP...
