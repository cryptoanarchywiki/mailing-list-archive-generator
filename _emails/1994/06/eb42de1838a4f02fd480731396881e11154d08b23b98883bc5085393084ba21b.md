This issue came up at the CFP-2 conference (Computers Freedom and Privacy,
March 92 edition). There were speakers there claiming that the audience,
when getting up from their chairs, would leave sufficient hair, skin
flakes, sweat, etc. behind that DNA mapping would be easy. Of course, this
mapping would be without the "suspect" having any knowledge of when the map
material was gathered.

I don't know if this was factual then, but no one rose up to claim that the
speaker was in error, and there were lots of folks in the audience that
could have challenged it. None did.

This speach was a major motivation in my interest in these topics.

That, and a chance to listen to Bruce Stirling, DED, and Jim Bidzos...
