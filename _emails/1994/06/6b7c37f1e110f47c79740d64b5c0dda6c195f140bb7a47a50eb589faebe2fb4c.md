     I would suggest getting a random number between 0 and 1440. This will
allow messages to be sent out every minute. Of course, you could just make
it once every 15 minutes (0-360) or every half hour (0-180). The idea is
that there could be a rather large delay introduced to the process, and
might make the remailer unpopular as a result. Mind you, I appreciate the
effort and generosity. I'm just making suggestions. :-)
