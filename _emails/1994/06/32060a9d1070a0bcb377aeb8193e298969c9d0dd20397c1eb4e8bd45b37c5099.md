Here is a simple problem.

Late one night, Bob discovers a clever new method of factoring
large products of distinct odd primes.  Bob may now perform such
factorizations in only a few hours for numbers up to 1024 bits on
his trusty old 486.

Bob spent a lot of time coding and testing his new algorithm, and
wishes to recover some of his expenses by factoring a few RSA
keys for well-to-do clients. Bob wants to do this without
disclosing his identity, so a certain evil three-letter agency
will not cover him with rubber hose marks trying to learn how his
algorithm works.

Alice is the CEO of a company who suspects PGP-encrypted mail is
being used by an employee to transfer trade secrets to a foreign
competitor.  Alice would pay any amount of money to read this
mail and confirm her suspicions.

Alice is a potential client for Bob.  Now for the hard part...

How does Bob make Alice, and other potential clients, aware of
the service he wishes to offer?

How do Bob and Alice conduct business anonymously while making
absolutely sure that neither is spoofing the other?  Alice needs
to know Bob isn't lying about being able to factor.  Bob needs to
know Alice has the means to pay him before he cracks a key.  Bob
and Alice need to exchange a factored key for money with no
chance that either will back out at the last moment and try to
steal from the other.

How much work should Bob expect to come his way if he charges $10
a bit for his factoring service?  $100 a bit?  $1000 a bit?

Comments anyone?
