The Macword survey is old news - about six months, if I remember right.
I'll see if I can dig up my copy.

I think we'd all turn into encryption buffs if the real extent of E-mail
surveillance was known; there are plenty of curious or nosy folks out there
with legitimate (or otherwise) access to root, or the local equivalent.
I'm not thinking of policy-oriented systematic plans of oversight, but the
occasional fishing expedition on a Friday night when everyone else is off
of the machine, and [..]. I've run into too many folks who admit to a once-in
a-while exploration of /usr/spool/mail to think that anything in there is
really secret. It's educational to see what happens to traditional notions
of ethics when paychecks are a week late, the managers are locked in the
conference room, and people are starting to wonder about who gets laid off
next.
