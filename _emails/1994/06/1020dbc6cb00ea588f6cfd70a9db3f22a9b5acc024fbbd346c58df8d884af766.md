As usual, Bidzos has a stick up his butt.  There is nothing in the NIST plan
that is a slam at RSA. (as such...Bidzo's seems to think that everyone hates
RSA.  Everyone's out to get them.)

I'd be more interested in what kind of an API they have for SkipJack.
Are they real API's or are we talking BlackBox programming?
