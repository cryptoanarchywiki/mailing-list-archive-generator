Ain't it a bitch...:-)

I'm *really* *not* making this up as I go along, but... If a clearinghouse
is "blessing" the trade they could still perform their function(??) of
notifying the corporation / issuer of a change in it's ownership.  The
"pointers" to the security just get swapped around... Uncle Sam still gets
to know who owns what.

However, it's possible under this scheme to have anonymous ownership, too.
If it were legal, of course...

While this thread is starting to look more like crypto-enabled and less
like actual crypto, I'm still thrashing this stuff around on my own.  My
crew figures there's some business in here somewhere.  If anyone wants to
yak about it with me off-line, let me know.... *I'm* having fun...


Cheers,

Bob
