    Personaly I think that is up to the individuals who are transmitting
    the messages. If they for some reason feel it is prudent then do it.
    Otherwise there are probably other more interesting things to  work on.

I wasn't asking about anything to do with what projects were interesting to
anyone in particular.  If I want to know what you're interested in working
on, I'll ask directly.  I was asking about something that might be equally
interesting to users and maintainers.

Is the RSA-IDEA combination known to be suspectible to any known/chosen
plaintext attacks?  Has anybody published a known/chosen plaintext attack
that works against what PGP does better than a brute force attack?

If a known/chosen plaintext attack works against PGP, then a PGP remailer's
keys aren't as secure as other keys cuz an attacker can encrypt arbitrary
text with them.  If nobody's figured out a known/chosen plaintext attack,
then remailer's keys are as good as anybody else's.
