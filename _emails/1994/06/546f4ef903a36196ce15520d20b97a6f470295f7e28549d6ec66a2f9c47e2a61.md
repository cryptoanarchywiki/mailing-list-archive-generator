I've had a lot of people make mistakes when using my remailer.  Maybe this
is common to happen to most people who run remailers, but the large number
of mistakes surprised me.  To eliminate the clutter in my inbox, I
modified my remailer to check the first line of the message for an Anon-To:
or Request-Remailing-To: header, in case the person forgot the double colon.
If the first line is blank, it checks the second.  This seems to have taken
care of most of the problems.

But somehow, someone figured out how to defeat my efforts and mess up anyway:
They began with the header Encrypted: PGP and then followed it with an
unencrypted message...
