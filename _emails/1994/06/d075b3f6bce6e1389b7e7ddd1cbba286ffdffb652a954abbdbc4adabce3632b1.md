	... Micali's major stuff, the ``fair'' public-key based systems.

Just to throw another sound bite in the pot:

Why would anyone in their right mind use a cryptosystem that's only "fair"
when they have their choice of so many "good" and "excellent" ones like
IDEA and RSA as well? :-) :-)

disclaimer: I haven't read Micali's papers in detail, but I understand that
the "fair' cryptosystem is effectively "key escrow in software".  Actually,
I haven't seen his protocols discussed in any level of detail on this list.
An overview might help improve the S/N ratio here..

   build 'em first, patent 'em, and *don't* license them to the government... 

Alternatively, hold out for 10% of the capital cost of the *entire*
communications system and put the money to good use if they're stupid
enough to pay.
