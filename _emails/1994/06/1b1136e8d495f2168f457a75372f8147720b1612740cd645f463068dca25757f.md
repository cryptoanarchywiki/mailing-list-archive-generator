I'll also note that as embarassing as Matt's discovery is, we must
continue to focus on the inherent flaw in the very concept of EES,
rather than on any particular technical flaw. The number of flaws we
can find with public information is limited, and NSA can always
bullshit congressmen until they give up. Besides, technical flaws can
be repaired. If people oppose the CONCEPT of the EES, then it makes no
difference how well implemented it is.

However, I really have to say, Matt's hack is still NEAT!
