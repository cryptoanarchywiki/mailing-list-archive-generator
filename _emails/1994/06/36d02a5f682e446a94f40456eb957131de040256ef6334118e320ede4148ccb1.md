Sounds like Mr. Seabrook may be just slightly anal retentive, only
a tad dangerous with his visions of a "kinder, gentler" net.

The culture that is "the Internet" is an anarchy and will probably
remain that way for some time to come. If he desires a more 
sanitized on-line world, he should probably stick to Prodigy.

Attitudes like his, in my own opinion, are what has made this
country (Amerika) a nation of overly sensitive dolts.

Cheers,

(speaking only for myself -- certainly not for Sprint...)
