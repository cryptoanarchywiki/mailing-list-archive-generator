There is no way to to translate the idea that I can see. Stealth
viruses work by patching the interrupts that AV programs watch-
(on a PC- Macs and other platforms are conceptually different)
INT 21h, etc. and the file attributes repoting mechanisms
in DOS, and lie. It is hardware specific, and I don't see anyway to
translate the concept to a networked environment in order to fool
'traffic cops.'

I wonder about the mutation engine concept, though...
