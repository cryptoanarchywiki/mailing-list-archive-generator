Yes, as I described in earlier mail this is certainly doable with our
CDMA system although position location was not one of the original
design goals for the system nor is it a requirement for the ones we're
currently building.

During drive tests in the demo/test system it was easy to tell by
watching a display in the cell when the test van had returned to the
starting point. We had a continuous display of round trip time which
would increase and then return to its original value. But we don't do
anything useful with this information at present. For data logging
purposes on field tests, we now use commercial Trimble GPS receivers
that have piezo gyros for dead reckoning through the GPS coverage
shadows. They work much better than the compass/wheel rotation counter
scheme used in the ETAK units we had before.

We already "net our time base with GPS" - each cell site has a GPS
timing receiver that controls frequencies and spreading codes within a
microsecond (limited mainly by SA dithering). This is needed to make
our soft-handoff work, but it does have the side effect of making
a potential location-determination system more practical.
