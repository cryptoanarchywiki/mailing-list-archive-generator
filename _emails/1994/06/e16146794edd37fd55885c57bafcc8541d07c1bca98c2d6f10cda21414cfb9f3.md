I'll point out that Matt concluded this based on empirical analysis of
LEAFs and IVs, no available documentation describes the nature of the
checksum. (More kudo's to Matt).

BTW, LEAF/IV pairs are manipulated by Tessera as a single operation. I
suppose this is, in retrospect, a big hint.

The observation that non-synchronized IVs pose little or no problem
was also another "damn; that should have been obvious" that Matt
picked up on and no one else got. I suppose the fact that the NSA
folks mixed the IV into the checksum meant that they thought
non-synchronized IVs would be more significant than they are.

PS Matt, you now have 14 more minutes of fame remaining. :-)
