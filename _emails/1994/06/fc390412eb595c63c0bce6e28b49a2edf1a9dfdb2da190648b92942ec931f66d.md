If you use the vox remailers, and you have added your PGP key tho my 
keyring, all mail send to a key [adress] wich is in my keyring will be 
encrypted using that key. Since vox is an UUCP site, time correlation is
less of a problem. Of course if your message is the only one that has been
encrypted, then ....
