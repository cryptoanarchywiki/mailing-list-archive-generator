This is a truth not limited to the US. The English spy analyst Phillip 
Knightley has dwelled a lot on this subject in his books, especially
in 'The Second Oldest Profession' (from the early-mid 80's) which, in
my opinion, gives an excellent historical background to the rise of
government intelligence agencies as the means of livelihood for hordes
of slightly odd academic personalities that otherwise might have had a
hard time finding employment.
