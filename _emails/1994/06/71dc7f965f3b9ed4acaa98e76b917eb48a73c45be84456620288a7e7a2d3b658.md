What you want is a Gunn diode oscillator w/ feedback.

Just remember to keep the temperature of the devices constant, semi-
conductors have a temperature dependancy which would allow them to monitor
the data and  possibly determine the gain of the amp and hence approx.
how much noise energy and sprectrum thereof it was contributing. Check
into Boltzmanns Constant applications to black body radiation.

I am not shure that a zener would produce any more  noise than a standard
diode. 
              
There might even be less noise because the design parameters are more tightly
controlled on a zener than standard diodes.

I actually like this idea a lot.

How about using the lines on the serial port for power?

How about a dongle?

If they have this close access to your hardware then you have a more 
serious problem.

I would suggest getting some of virus source out there and take a look
at how the detectors watch system activity for fishy writes. Should not
be hard to load another TSR which watchdogs the system for any bogus
or un-authorized reads from the device. Just pass all system calls through
the TSR to access the device.
