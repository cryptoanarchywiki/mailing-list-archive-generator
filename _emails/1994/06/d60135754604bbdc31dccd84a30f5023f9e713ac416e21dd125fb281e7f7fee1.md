Though someone (Time?) published a child's description of the 'punishment 
room,' that was not my contention. As the author had provided Waco as an 
example of cult criminality, my response explained why, _assuming_ such a
cult _was_ indeed criminal, it's crimes would _in no way_ occur, or be
enhanced by, the usage of the Internet. 

Any crime (apart from white collar financial fraud) has to occur in a physical
location, not in cyberspace...
