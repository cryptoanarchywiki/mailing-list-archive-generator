Yeah.  On the other hand, his weight *is* strongly, if quietly,
behind Clipper - he's pushing the Digital Tele-phony Initiative to prevent
the phone companies from offering real crypto, so that if one of them
*does* decide to offer real non-Clipper encrypted service (e.g. cellphones),
they won't be able to.  If he were officially on the side of Clipper,
then the Clipper forces wouldn't be able to say "it's purely voluntary";
for now they can pretend to be totally separate efforts.
