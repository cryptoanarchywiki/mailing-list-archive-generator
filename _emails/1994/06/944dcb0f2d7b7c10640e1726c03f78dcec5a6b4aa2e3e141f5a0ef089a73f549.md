ANNOUNCEMENT
------------

The June meeting will be held tommorrow, Saturday, June 11, at Silicon
Graphics.  This will be our second meeting at SGI.  We're no longer at
Cygnus; thanks again to John Gilmore for the use of Cygnus facilities.
Thanks to Katy Kislitzin for arranging the use of SGI facilities.

This month's meeting will be about "Keys and Key Distribution."
Contributions are always welcomed; on-topic will have priority, but
off-topic will be fine if we have time.  This month's meeting will be
mostly roundtable discussion.

There will be no MBONE this month.  Look for it next time.

Date: Saturday, June 11, 1994
Time: 12:00 noon - 6:00 p.m.
Place: Cafe Iris, Building 5
       Silicon Graphics
       Mt. View, CA, USA
Theme: "Keys and Key Distribution"

Eric

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIRECTIONS:

  Silicon Graphics, Inc.
  Building 5 (SGI Cafeteria)
  2025 North Shoreline Boulevard
  Mountain View, CA

From 101 take Shoreline East.  This is towards Shoreline Amphitheatre.
It's also "logical east", and points more north that east.  (That is,
it's east with respect to 101 North, which points west near the exit.)
If you're coming in on 101 South, you'll cross over the bridge.

Continue on Shoreline and go past a whole bunch of other SGI
buildings.  Turn right onto Steirlin Court at the big red metal
sculpture.  There will be even more SGI buildings surrounding
you--take note of the building numbers.  Go almost to the end of this
street.  Building 5 is on the right.
