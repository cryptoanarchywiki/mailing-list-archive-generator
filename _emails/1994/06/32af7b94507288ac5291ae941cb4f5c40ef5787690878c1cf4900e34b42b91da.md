   Having been naive enough to actually read a number of his posts
regarding PGP-related topics on the usenet groups, I would likewise
be amazed if "Dr. Sternlight" was indeed a 'highly placed' govt
official, if for no other reason than it would be inconceivable 
for any branch of our government that's supposed to operate in secret 
to allow the stream of effluent that he generates over the net to 
appear _with attribution_.  A wanna-be net-cop with too much time
on his hands, perhaps, but a high government offical in a 
super-secret agency???  NOT!
