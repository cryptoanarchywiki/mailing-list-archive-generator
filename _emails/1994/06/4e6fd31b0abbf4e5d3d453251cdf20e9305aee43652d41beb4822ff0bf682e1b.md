Yeah, that was brain damage on my part.  My basic idea was that it
is possible, for some chaining methods, to find out where in the
LEAF the chipid is by watching what changes when you vary the keys and
the chipids used, even if you *don't* have the Family Key or know
the encryption mode, but the set of modes and component orders for
which that works is more limited than I first thought.
There are still some that work, though.
