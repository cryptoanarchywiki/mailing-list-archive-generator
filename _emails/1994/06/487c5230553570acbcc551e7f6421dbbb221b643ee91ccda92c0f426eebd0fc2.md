Just out of curiosity - could i get into trouble for keeping some US-only 
crypto stuff in my ftp directory in Australia? I've just recently created

If anyone wants to give me a copy, drop it off at 
tartarus.uwa.edu.au:/pub/dichro/incoming
 - provided, of course, that it is legal for you to do so ...:)
