It looks like Ralph Stokes has finally learned about Internet and 
Usenet gateways and is now spreading his prenicious religious 
bigotry beyond the borders of Fido-land. (He spammed several 
Usenet newsgroups with this malicious diatribe, too)  Mr. Stokes 
is infamous for promulgating hatred and intolerance on certain 
religious echoes on Fidonet.  He is one of those rare breed of 
fanatics called "Ruckmanites" who follow the xenophobic rantings 
of an ultra-fundamentalist evangelist from Florida named Peter 
Ruckman.  They have come to be know, less affectionately, as 
"WRECKmanites" or "Ruckbots".

Stokes even dared to post his Fidonet/Internet addresses.  I 
wonder if he's prepared for the response to his worldwide "spam" 
post?  I guess he's about to learn!  If you'd care to protest his 
net.abuse, a polite letter to his sysop, net coordinator, and 
alternate net cooordinator would probably be in order.  The way 
Fidonet works, he'll be burning up their resources, too, so they 
should probably be made aware of your feelings.  Because of the 
topology of the fidonet.org domain, appropriate addresses for 
complaint, at your discretion, are as follows:

    His sysop:                      sysop@f1611.n375.z1.fidonet.org
    His Net coordinator:            sysop@f0.n375.z1.fidonet.org
    His alternate Net coordinator:  sysop@f1.n375.z1.fidonet.org

The operative expression on Fidonet, as concerns grounds for 
disciplining an abusive user, is "excessively annoying behavior".  
You might wish to make mention of that phrase in any letters that 
you write.  In any event, reading his mail should "keep him off 
the streets" (or info super-highway) for awhile... :)
