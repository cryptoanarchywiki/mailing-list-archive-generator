   Cypherpunks' Electronic Book (CEB) 6 the Unpleasantness.

As badly as it was received, you should be proud to take the blame!
But no, I don't blame you.

   I have not followed your dysfunctional relationships with your
buddies Detweiler & Hettinga, but do feel free to keep them to your-
self. Are you trying disingenuously to identify me with these people?
They say that if you squint your eyes just right & long enough, dogs
look look much like Adolph Hitler. So, Tim, why don't you go out & find
one, squat, & squint till you notice the resemblance? :-) That's a
joke Tim.
   But in a more serious vein Tim (preferable a major one), I thought
your bad experience with the Extropians would have kept you from assaulting
-ing people with claims of being elements in a class based on flimsy
comparisons. You remember when your candy ass got chased off the
Extropians' list with allegations of your being a fascist. But, of
course, that would have scared anyone: a bunch of savage Extropians
writing Fascist! Fascist! Fascist! :-)

   Note: There is no covert meaning to the above paragraph. I really was
naive in thinking that they might not have their time fully occupied
with projects.

Mocking other peoples' hurt feelings can get you into places where your
own delicate feelings get hurt.

>More nonsense. Nonsense I am finished responding to.

Tim, for a guy who doesn't care about other peoples' hurt feelings, you
have got real thin skin.

>--Tim May

   Its surprising to me that my CEB plan got such bad reviews. I got my
idea flamed by a lot of C'punks but life is tough. You present an idea
& its not necessarily going to get accepted. You take a chance. But
that is fair. I carry no grudge against the other C'punks. Tim May,
however, is different. He criticized ME! & he was so unpleasant!
Now we find out how Tim likes the intentionally unpleasant.
   I don't know Tim May very well but I've noticed he gets into a lot of
flame wars. Could this be his M O?: Get into an argument with a victim
over a matter of fact, then slyly turn it into an attack on the person
without losing the applause of the gallery? Also, I don't like his
shrill strident manner.
   I don't like a bully. When I run into one, I like to make sure he
takes a few lumps too!
                                            Yours Truly,
                                            Gary Jeffers
                                     PUSH EM BACK! PUSH EM BACK!
                                     WWWAAAYYY  BBBAAACCCKK!
                                     BBBEEEAAATTTT  STATE !
