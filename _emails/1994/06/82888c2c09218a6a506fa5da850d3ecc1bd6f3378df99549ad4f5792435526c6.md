	 How about a SCSI device instead.  Most UNIX boxes and Macs
	 nowadays have a few unused SCSI IDs.  The great majority of
	 DOS machines with SCSI (all those new ones with CD-ROMs, etc.)
	 have unused SCSI IDs.  SCSI has the advantage of being rather
	 fast, and is a cross-platform solution.

``Cross-platform'' is great, but ``fast'' is probably a bad idea.
Few random number generators are particularly fast, and if you sample
the input too rapidly, you're likely to get too high a correlation
between successive bits.
