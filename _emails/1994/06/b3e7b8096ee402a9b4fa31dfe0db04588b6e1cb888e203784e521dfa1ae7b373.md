I waited for a good reply to this and didn't see one.  Smart people have 
commented on this before and no one in this round seems to be remembering.

Delay--time--isn't what matters.  It's confusion about which message is
which that matters.  So if I get 10 messages in one minute, I can scramble
the order and send them out the next minute, and I've done my job--at
least the order-scrambling part.  (You also need to pad or packetize
messages.)

So use serial numbers, not times!  Send a message for every one you get, 
keep a fixed number of messages queued, and add dummies if necessary
to keep things moving.

Why not have the dummy message forwarded in a long enough chain and back to 
you?  Then you could swallow it or turn it into another dummy, depending on
whether you need to hurry your queue right now.

I don't think the amount of dummy traffic is a big problem.  You only need
enough to keep your queue flowing.  Plus, if the remailers only generate
dummies when necessary, the total dummy traffic is self-regulating, since
multi-hop dummies are x-lax for every remailer they pass through.

I like thinking about the traffic pattern with get-one-send-one remailers:
A user sends a message, and it seems to bounce from remailer to remailer
to remailer...to a final recipient--but no, it was all a shell game!
