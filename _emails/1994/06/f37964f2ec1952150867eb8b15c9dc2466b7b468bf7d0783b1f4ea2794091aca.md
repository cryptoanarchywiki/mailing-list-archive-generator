Well, as I read that sentence in isolation, it is true, and a Good Thing.
I will be concerned if the author is urging "institutional" supervision.
Guess I gotta go read the New Yorker now.  Sheesh, you guys, you get me
to read the Atlantic Monthly, now the New Yorker.  I hope they have 
gotten away from their dilatory style, and that the cartoons are still
good, if I gotta waste my money this way.
