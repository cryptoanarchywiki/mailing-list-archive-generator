Would you pray tell why these are not 'rights' under that government and

 Seems to me these are all results of recognizing that property is a possesion
since even optical cables and such are property, either intellectual or 
otherwise. If a government, when formed, is given a charter which limits
the ability of others to access these possessions then I hold their is an
implied 'natural' right.

Only if the charter allows it. I refer you to Santyana.
