I was under the impression that the law obligated you to license
patents -- albeit not necessarily at an attractive price. I am quite
likely to be mistaken on this -- my memory on the topic is very
sketchy, as demonstrated by the fact that I didn't realize the
government can patent things (although I was right on copyrights.)
