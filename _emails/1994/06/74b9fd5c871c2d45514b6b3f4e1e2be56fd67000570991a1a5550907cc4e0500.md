The point of my NIST ftp site question was not to find a place to get DES  
source, I know I can get DES source in lots of places.  I was just trying  
to find out if the NIST site still had FIPS-181 with DES code.  Its  
presence on a internationally accessible *US government* site would be an  
embarrassment to the anti-export camp.

I know, but I thought it would be kind of ironic if anyone could get DES  
source directly from the federal government.
