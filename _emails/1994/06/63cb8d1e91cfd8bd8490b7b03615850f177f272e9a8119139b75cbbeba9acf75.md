But for now, the auxiliary Portable Position Escrow Devices (cellphones,
to mix in the OJ thread) augment the satellite support.
Under no circumstances shoudl citizen-units be permitted to put their
PPEDs in moving vehicles driven by other people; fortunately,
existing littering laws prevent people from tossing their cellphones
into moving pickup trucks, and the forthcoming ban on Gun Transportation
Devices should eliminate pickup trucks before the population as a whole notices.
Meanwhile, plans to restrict citizen-units to their Position Escrow Zones
unless carrying PPEDs are being evaluated, and a cost-benefit analysis
versus enhancing the planned SmartCard systems will be forthcoming.

... And they think we're just working for the Post Office....
