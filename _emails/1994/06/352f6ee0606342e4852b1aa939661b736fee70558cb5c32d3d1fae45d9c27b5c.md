After the RSA-129 factoring there was considerable discussion on sci.crypt
about how much harder a 1024 bit key would be using current algorithms.
There was some disagreement, but it did not seem that a 1024 bit key would
be good for 10000 years; as I recall, the time scale was more like a few
decades before it would fall to an attack as expensive as RSA-129.  Larger
keys with 2K bits, OTOH, were good for thousands or millions of years
(of course it's hard to extrapolate computer power out that far).  Does
anyone have more precise numbers?

People have been talking as though the only possible improvements
to factoring algorithms would be to jump to polynomial or near-polynomial
time.  Obviously it is equally possible that improvements will occur as
they have in the past, reductions to the exponents or constant factors but
still an exponential algorithm.  In such a scenario it is very plausible
that 1K bit keys would be unsafe while keys of a few K would be fine.
