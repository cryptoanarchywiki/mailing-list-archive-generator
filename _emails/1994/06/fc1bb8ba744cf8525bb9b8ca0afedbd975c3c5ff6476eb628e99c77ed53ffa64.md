True, but I don't know if he'd think of this one...

I'm curious - all the stuff that comes with PGP says to not let your secret
key /pass phrase out of your sight, but why is it necessary to guard your
secret key so carefully?  After all, you have to type your pass phrase to
use the secret key, so without the pass phrase, the secret key is useless,
isn't it?  I mean, besides just destroying it...

Well, that's already happening, but it's hard to stop someone from dropping
a piece of email in your mailbox saying, "xxx gave me your resume, and it
looks good.  Can we talk?"
