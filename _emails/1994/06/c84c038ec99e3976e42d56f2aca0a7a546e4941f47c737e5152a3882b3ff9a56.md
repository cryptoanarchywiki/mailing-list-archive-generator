   Might it be appropriate, though, to create an alt group for that purpose?

One has already been created:  alt.numbers.random

Check it out; it's really there, and needs some traffic.  In order to
make the numbers really look random (in order to satisfy the group
charter), though, please strip off any PGP headers before posting.

You may post factorizations of peoples public keys to
alt.numbers.prime, as well.

Thanks to Eric Hollander for actually creating the group.  The two of
us have lots more in the alt.numbers.* hierarchy.

Er, software to effectively use this forum would be appreciated.

Eric
