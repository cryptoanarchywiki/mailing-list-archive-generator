I imagine they(tm) would have countermeasures for this kind of thing,
given that once they catch a keyword, they know it's source, and have some
idea of the kinds of patterns which are likely to be real communications. 

The Web site probably went straight into a junk filter, which would make
it an ideal place to post your secrets from then on :-)
