Well, you *did* ask. Don't blame me. 

It is summed up well at:
http://vortex.hawo.stw.uni-erlangen.de/~asheiduk/pgg/06S/06S008.html

or, more prosaically, at:
http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/6270/ed_morning.htm

Straight from the horse's mouth:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_79000/79273.stm

A transcript of an actual game can be found at:
http://www.lazarus.demon.co.uk/mc/mc100.html - he also has many other links
at: http://www.lazarus.demon.co.uk/mc/mc.html

The Encyclopaedia Morningtonia has more detail than anyone in their right
brain would want to know about the game  at:
http://aurora.york.ac.uk/mc_em.html

Here are the rules of a slightly different game that Richard may have been
thinking of:
http://members.xoom.com/mornomic/ruleset.html and
