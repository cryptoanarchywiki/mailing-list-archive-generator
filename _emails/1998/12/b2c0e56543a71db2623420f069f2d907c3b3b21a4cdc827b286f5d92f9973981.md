There are some new papers on the Twofish webpage.

We have improved our performance numbers.  On Pentium-class machines, key
setup is faster.  We also have large-RAM implementations, that speed key
setup at the expense of 256K of RAM.  We aso have a variety of performance
options on smart cards, trading RAM off for speed.  And finally, we have a
new hardware implementation that reduces the total gate count.  Details are
in Twofish Technical Report #3:

	http://www.counterpane.com/twofish-speed.html

Dave Barton has implemented Twofish in Delphi:

And finally, we have compared the performance of all AES submissions on
32-bit processors, smart cards, and hardware.  Our results are in.

As always, thanks for your support.
