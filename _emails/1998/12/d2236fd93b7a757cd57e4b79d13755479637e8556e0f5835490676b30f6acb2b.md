The Chinese government has put 30-year-old Shanghai computer 
software businessman Lin Hai on trial for "inciting the 
overthrow of state power" by providing 30,000 e-mail addresses 
to a U.S. Internet magazine called "Big Reference" published by 
Chinese dissidents.  Chinese authorities closed the four-hour 
trial for what it said were "national security" reasons, and 
"persuaded" one member of Lin's legal team not to attend the 
trial.  Lin's wife Xu Hong, who was questioned by the police 
for six hours, has indicated that Lin's lawyer "said he didn't 
have a very good feeling -- that things won't be good for Lin 
and he will probably be found guilty."
