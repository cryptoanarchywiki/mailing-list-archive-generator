Declan points out some scary stuff here but no president (even Clinton)
would be stupid enough to do something so outrageous. They would have to
know that it would spark a long running a especially bloody revolution. 

Why risk it when they can just keep approaching totalitarianism
incrementally with such activities as the FuckingDICks "Know Your Customer"
activities. It's much quieter and infinitely less likely to result in a
revolution.
