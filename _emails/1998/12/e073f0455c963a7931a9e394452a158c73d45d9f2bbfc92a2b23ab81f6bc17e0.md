are you sure?

according to

http://www.pgpi.com/ 

PGP 6.0.2i available soon

The PGP 6.0.2 source code books have arrived in Europe, and work is
going on to scan them in and create an international version: 6.0.2i.
However, there are 25 volumes and over 12,000 pages, so it will
probably take a while to finish.

drop out, turn on, and groove with the chemicals and light shows at
discotheques. -- art linkletter
