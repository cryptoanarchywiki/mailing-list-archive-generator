Your employer is not obligated to pay you during your arbitrarily-long

See: Fully Informed Jury Amendment

Since snailmail is datagrams, how do they know you received their packet?

Remember that you aren't obligated to explain your reasons any more

Don't stand out and you can accomplish more subversion.
