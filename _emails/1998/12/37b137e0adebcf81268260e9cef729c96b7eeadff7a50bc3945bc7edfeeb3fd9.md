Worse, the *only* end you'll achieve is to piss off nearly everyone
who *might* have been interested in what you had to say (and getting
your name added to the Black Hole database and tens of thousands of

Get real -- is there *anyone* on the net who treats unsolicited email
as anything other than unadulterated dreck?
