:Hello,
:We are in the midst of developing logos 4 the global campaign
:proposed as followup 2 the Wassenaar decision.
:The logos are here:

:http://www.quintessenz.at/freecrypto.html
:
:We would appreciate ur evaluation, suggestions highly welcome.

I can see using the smaller ones ("echelons" @ ~8.5k), but the other
[animated gif's] are simply too big.  The download time on them is
excessive (although I do like their design).  Remember *most* ppl are
still accessing the www at 28k +/-.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
