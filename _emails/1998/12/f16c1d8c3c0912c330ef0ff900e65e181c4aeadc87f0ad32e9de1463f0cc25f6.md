We have just completed technology validation demo for an "active virtual
firewall" that utilizes a new technique, software genetics, to secure
remotes and hosts. Technical details are available from
<kalember@stanford.edu>. The approach is virtually impervious to a text
hack and should be investigated by anyone serious about securing VPN to
Internet portals, or any private network. This is new technology--no data
is encrypted.

Technical details from our developers at <kalember@stanford.edu>.
