Subject: COMMENT: Minimum Security Devices and Procedures and Bank Secrecy Act 

I would like to state that this is the most Orwellian, privacy-invading,
search-without-a-warrant, snoopy regulation I have ever seen.  I believe it is
a horrible idea that should never be allowed.  I am growing so tired of my
government trying to monitor it's every citizen's every move just in case
there may be a criminal act committed.  

Every citizen is innocent until proven guilty and has a right to privacy
against such causeless searches.  As the 4th amendment to the Constitution of
the United States says (have you ever heard of it?): 

"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,
SHALL NOT BE VIOLATED, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable
cause, supported by oaths and affirmation, and particularly describing
the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."

What you advocate is a warrantless search of all my financial papers and
effects without probable cause or evidence of any sort of crime being
committed.  This kind of nosy government action is exactly the kind of thing
that should never be allowed in a free state.  I will fight to keep my nation
from becoming a 24- hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week monitored police state until my
last breath.

I urge you to vote against this ghastly measure and to banish it and any act
like it to the trashcan.  The citizens of the United States deserve better
than to be treated like children watched over by Mother Government.  

If this act is passed, I know what my response will be.  I will promptly
withdraw all my monies from any institution that follows these regulations,
refuse to do any sort of business with them, and urge all my friends and
family to do the same.  I know that many others will do the same without
hesitation.  

Try explaining to your member and nonmember banks why there is such a sudden
cash shortage and why they are losing customers left and right.  This act
would undoubtedly trigger a nationwide economic crisis as people withdrew from
a banking system that had become a puppet of law enforcement and Big Brother. 
We must be able to TRUST our banks with our money.  WE are the customers and
any bank that holds goverment surveillance above my trust is no bank that I
will do business with.

I will simply take my paychecks each month and cash them in their entirety and
then do what I want, when I want, unwatched, with my money.  I will not be
surveilled by Big Brother under the guise of protecting me against shadowy
criminals.  

I value my privacy highly, not because I am a criminal, but because I am a
free American, and such privacy is guaranteed to me by our highest legal
document (the Constitution).  I recommend the FDIC members read it sometime,
because obviously they never have before, or this ludicrous act would have
never even been proposed.

Simply put, this is the worst idea I have ever heard and strongly urge its
defeat and nonadoption.  Thank you.
