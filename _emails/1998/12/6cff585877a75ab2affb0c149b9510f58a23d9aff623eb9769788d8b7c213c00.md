SSA, IRS, VA A-OK FOR Y2K

President Clinton says that the U.S. Treasury Financial Management System
has completed testing by independent auditors and is now "certified as Y2K
(Year 2000) compliant."  The Y2K problem or "millennium bug" is found in
old programs that (because their authors used only two rather than four digits
to designate years) will make mistakes when doing calculations based on
dates.  The Social Security Administration has led the way in dealing with
the Y2K problem, which it first started working on in 1989.
