there must be something here that I'm missing.  At the core of this
protocol seems to be the establishment not of crypto anarchy but of a
crypto elite. in this scheme only the processors of computing power  have
economic power.  Now I realize that our current economic system is based on
economic power being invested in a closed community of powerful elites, and
is by no means egalitarian, but this looks to be like simply substituting
one group of "haves" for a different group of "haves"

I have to admit not being familiar with the Orthodoxy of crypto anarchy,
but if the premise is a centerless self organizing system of free agents
this protocol seems to miss the mark. or what is it that I am missing here?
