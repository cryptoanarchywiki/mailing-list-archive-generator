Internet is slowing China's efforts to maintain control

To eliminate political opposition by the China Democratic Party, Chinese
authorities are putting prominent dissidents on trial for "inciting the
overthrow of state power," but the Internet is making it difficult for them
to accomplish their goal.  The Washington, D.C.-based electronic magazine
VIP Reference is a widely-used news source and network for dissident
activities.  Boston University professor Merle Goldman says, "It was
relatively easy for the authorities to get rid of Democracy Walls in
Beijing and in other cities in 1979, but it is virtually impossible to close down
the use of the Internet as a means of political communication."
