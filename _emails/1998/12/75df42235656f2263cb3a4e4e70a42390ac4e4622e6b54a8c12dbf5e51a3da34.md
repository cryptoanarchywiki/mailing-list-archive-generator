If you want to vote your conscience (if it's a drug prosecution and you
don't agree with drug laws for instance), there are a few organizations
that you might want to look at. Maybe check out http://www.cato.org/ which
last I checked had an advertisement for a new book on jury nullification
etc. on their home page.
