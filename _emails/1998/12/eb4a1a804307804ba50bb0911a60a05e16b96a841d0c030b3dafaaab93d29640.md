I confess to watching and listening to entirely too much coverage of this
event, on CNN, Court TV, CNBC, MSNBC, Fox, and the networks. Maybe more
coverage than I watched in 1995 for the O.J. trial.

The legislative branch, Congress, is free to pass any sort of resolution
condemning Bill Clinton that they wish to. In fact, the Congress once quite
constitutionally voted a bill of censure of President Andrew Jackson.

(These bills of censure are really just expressions of negative opinion.
They carry no consequences other than being "the sense of Congress.')

What they cannot do is to pass a "bill of attainder," a law punishing a
specific person, whether a President or you and me. By punishment I mean a
fine, or imprisonment.

Outside of this, they are free to do as they wish.

Not that I support such a bullshit minor punishment. Clinton is _asking_
for Congress to censure him, so what's the point?
