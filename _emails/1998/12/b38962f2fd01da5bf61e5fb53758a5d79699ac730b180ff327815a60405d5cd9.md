Given: if the adversary captures your PGP keyring, he
will know your contacts.  Your secure contacts.  

Therefore: it would be mighty nice if access to your
keyring's address list required a passphrase (which
perhaps was valid for several hours, it being a pain
to retype a decent passphrase).

You will note that the PGP plugins for Eudora allow
any buffoon with access to your machine to discover
who you talk to securely.
