CQRE [Secure] Exhibition & Congress provides a new international
forum giving a close-up view on information security in the context
of rapidly evolving economic processes. The unprecedented reliance
on computer technology has transformed the previous technical
side-issue "information security" to a management problem requiring
decisions of strategic importance. Hence, the targeted audience
represents decision makers from government, industry, commercial,
and academic communities.

If you are concerned with solutions relating to the protection of
your countrys information infrastructure or a commercial
enterprise, consider submitting a paper to the CQRE [Secure]
Exhibition & Congress.

economic processes will also be welcome. Authors are invited to

articles or "high quality" case studies and position papers.
Product advertisements are welcome for presentation, but will not
be considered for the proceedings. Manuscripts must be in English,
and not more than 2.000 words. The extended abstracts should be in
a form suitable for anonymous review, without author's names,
affiliations, acknowledgements or obvious references. Contributions
must not be submitted in parallel to any conference or workshop
that has proceedings. Separately, an abstract of the paper with no

that present alternative/controversial viewpoints or those that
encourage lively discussions of relevant issues. Panels that are
collections of unrefereed papers will not be considered. Panel
proposals should be a minimum of one page describing the subject
matter, the appropriateness of the panel for this conference and
