Forward (11/26/98):

They moved CJ from Springfield on the 18th. He is in Oklahoma City 
awaiting  movement supposedly next week. I talked with him and he 
sounded okay. He would like to receive copies of what has been written 
and posted about him. He doen't know  where he is going. His lawyer 
should find out next week.
