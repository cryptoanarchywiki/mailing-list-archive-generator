STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION - Worldwide Caution - Iraq
============================================================
Worldwide Caution - Iraq - Public Announcement
 December 16, 1998

In light of the military operations against Iraq and the potential 
for retaliatory action, the Department of State urges U.S. citizens 
traveling or residing abroad to review their security practices, to 
remain alert to the changing situation, and to exercise much greater 
caution than usual.  While the U.S. Government has no specific 
information about threats to American citizens at this time, the 
potential for retaliatory acts against U.S. citizens exists.

American citizens traveling or residing abroad are reminded to 
maintain a high level of vigilance and to take appropriate measures 
to protect their personal security.  In addition, American citizens 
should maintain a low profile, vary routes and times for all travel, 
and treat mail from unfamiliar sources with suspicion.

American citizens traveling or residing abroad should contact the 
nearest U.S. embassy or consulate by telephone or fax for up-to-date 
information on security conditions.  Current information on 
operations of U.S. embassies and consulates is also available on the 
Internet at http://travel.state.gov.  In addition, U.S. citizens 
planning to travel abroad should consult the Department of State 
Public Announcements, Travel Warnings, Consular Information Sheets, 
and regional brochures.

This Public Announcement supplements the November 12, 1998 
Worldwide Caution Public Announcement and the November 3 Public 
Announcement on Iraq and expires on March 15, 1999.
