A federal judge has ruled against the school district of a Missouri high
school student suspended because he and his sister posted a personal Web
page using vulgar language to criticize the school's official Web site.
U.S. District Court Judge Rodney Sippel has issued a preliminary injunction
barring the school district from suspending the student, punishing him, or
restricting his ability to post his personal home page. Sippel's opinion
asserts:  "Dislike or being upset by the content of a student's speech is
not an acceptable justification for limiting student speech."
