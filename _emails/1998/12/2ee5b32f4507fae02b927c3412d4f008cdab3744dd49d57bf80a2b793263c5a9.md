Hi all, I caught the following NAVTEX intercepts last night and
thought they may be of interest to others, all were received on 518KHz.
They are being repeated frequently be all the U/K stations and the 
Netherlands Coastguard, and similar messages are being broadcast by some 
of the Scandinavian stations.
