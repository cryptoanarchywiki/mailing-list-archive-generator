The United States and 32 other nations that belong to a group 
called the Wassenaar Arrangement, which coordinates export 
policies for technologies that have both civilian and military 
use, have signed an agreement restricting exports of encryption 
technology from their countries.  The Clinton administration, 
which has already imposed such controls in this country, says 
the agreement will help American companies compete on a more 
equal footing with their counterparts abroad.  Privacy 
organizations are critical of the agreement, and a counsel for 
the advocacy group Americans for Computer Privacy says there 
will still be enormous differences in how the countries put the 
agreement into practice.
