I saw an article on this in InfoWorld. NAI/TIS and DARPA talking about
putting self-switching packets into the network. I don't see this as too
far off from packets purchasing their passage across the network with
micromoney of some kind.

All spookiness of the current research principals aside, of course...

Cheers,
Robert Hettinga
