One way to determine which programs are the best for this purpose would be
to study what various governments have taken some action on.  Some obvious ones:

  PGP (various versions, high level of government interest)
  Snuffle (extended US litigation)
  All the AES candidates (strictly-controlled dissemination from NIST)
  SecureOffice (Charles Booher's program -- US government has taken action)
  Applied Cryptography disk (US export license denied)

It would also be nice to have an infrastructural component, such as (when
ready for mass distribution) the Linux/FreeSWAN IPSec release; this doesn't
have quite the cachet of programs on which the government has already weighed
in, though.
