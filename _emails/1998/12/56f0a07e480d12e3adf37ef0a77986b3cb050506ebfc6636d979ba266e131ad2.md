Good question. That's why I wouldn't use it either. (I haven't had reason to
use it, so 'll take Anonymous's word that source isn't available.)

If people want to release software like this, they need a better argument
for its security than "Trust us, it's secure." 

Considering that there is no net loss when developers of such a product
release source code so that people can look it over and compile it
themselves, I don't have any reason to trust such software.

Aren't McAfee and PGP Inc. members of KRAP and promoting Big Brother Inside?
I've lost track.
