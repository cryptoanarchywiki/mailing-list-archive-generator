No, the wet component filtrates out of the hole, into the soil.

Compression happens automaitcally.

Yeah, they are not too sanitary, but it is livable.

I refer you to the book "Where there is no doctor" that talks
about it. (a great book, all in all)

I suspect that this will not be happening a lot in the cleaner
parts of the city.

Well, if you have no food, you make no shit.
