'Tis the day after Christmas  
And something's not right
Were painfully aware
That our clothes are too tight.

We ate lots of gravy
And pumpkin pie too
Oh, no, not a diet...
But what shall we do?

Now you can lose weight without suffering.   Call Tides of Life at
1-888-817-7443 for information on safe, natural, and effective weight
loss products.

Our premier product, Cheat & Eat, contains 1000 mg of chitosan per
tablet along with herbs.  This binds to fats and sugars in the
intestinal tract, blocking absorption and passing them out of the body
before you can absorb the calories!  Also stops sugar cravings. 
Clinical studies show an average weight loss of 4 pounds per week with
no drugs, side effects or starvation diets!  We are offering a great
introductory price of $29.50 plus $2.50 shipping for a 6 week supply. 
You can buy much weaker chitosan products for $70/bottle but we have
located the best product for you at the best price.

Call 1-888-817-7443 for more information on Cheat & Eat and other
natural weight loss products.  Tides of Life has specialized in natural
hormonal products and related health supplements since 1993.  Free price
list upon request.
