I wonder how the good 'ol Beeb will handle loads of votes from non-uk
people.  Especially how will they cope with anonymous remailers.

I know this is off-topic cypherpunks but lets indulge in a little gentle
humour.

All,
We are going to try to influence the result of the voting for BBC
Sports Personality of the year. It has been decided that David Beckham
would provide most embarrassment to the organisers if winning, so
could you all e-mail your vote to the following address:

sports.review@bbc.co.uk

More importantly, can you forward this mail to all your mates &
acquaintances asap in the hope that they will participate. Your
co-operation in this matter is greatly appreciated
