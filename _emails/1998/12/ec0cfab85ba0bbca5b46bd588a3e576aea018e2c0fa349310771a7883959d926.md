NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite objections from civil libertarians, the
city's police commissioner proposed Monday to take a DNA sample along
with the fingerprints of everyone arrested.
 
Commissioner Howard Safir said the test would solve crimes and help
curb repeat offenders. ``The innocents have nothing to fear ... only
if you are guilty should you worry about DNA testing,'' he said.
 
                              ...
 
In Britain, where DNA samples are taken from every suspect, officials
have solved 17 major cases using such data since 1995, according to
the National Institute of Justice Journal.
