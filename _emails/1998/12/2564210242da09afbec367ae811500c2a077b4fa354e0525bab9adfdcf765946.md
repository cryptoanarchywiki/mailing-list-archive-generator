Apparently you did not see the post which directed you to
http://www.nist.gov/aes/.  This is the home page for the AES.  It has
links to independent analyses of the algorithms, as well as performance
information.  From that page we find:

Block Cipher Lounge
        http://www.ii.uib.no/~larsr/aes.html
cAESar Project
        http://www.dice.ucl.ac.be/crypto/CAESAR/caesar.html
Efficiency Testing Table

Efficiency Testing Results

Analysis from Louis Granboulan
