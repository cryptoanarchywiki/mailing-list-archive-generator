Is anyone aware of any critical evaluations 
performed on the security of the Network Associates 
(a.k.a. McAfee) PGP for Personal Privacy?  Traditionally, 
PGP source code has always been available for 
evaluation by the Net community, but this isn't the 
case with the newer commercial versions.

Additionally, and this is a bit paranoid, but PGP in 
the past has come with digitally signed files to 
authenticate the integrity of the files.  Once again, 
commercial versions offer no such guarantee that the 
software hasn't been tampered with between the factory 
and the store shelves.

Comments?
