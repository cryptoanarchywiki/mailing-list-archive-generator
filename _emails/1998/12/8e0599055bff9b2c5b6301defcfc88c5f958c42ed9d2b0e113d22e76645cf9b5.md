I'm maintaining the international kernel patch for Linux which aims to
collect all crypto-related features for the Linux kernel in one easy
patch.  This patch is tracking the development version of Linux, not
the stable one.  The patch is available from:

ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/Linux/kerneli/v2.1/

The loopback modules currently supports the following ciphers: serpent
(cbc), mars (cbc), rc6 (cbc), dfc (cbc), blowfish (cbc), cast-128
(ecb), and twofish (cbc).

This code is changing rapidly, so if you feel uneasy about development
versions of the kernel, this might not be for you until it has become
a bit more stable.

If you patch linux-2.1.131 (the latest release) with
patch-int-2.1.131.1.gz you can look in the Documentation/crypto
directory for some mount-patches.  However I intend to make a newer
patch with support for more of the cipher algorithms - and against the
latest util-linux.

If you want to use the stable kernel, you can look at
ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/Linux/kerneli/net-source/loop/ for a
collection of loop-crypto patches against 2.0.x.

You can also look into tcfs available at 
ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/Linux/kerneli/net-source/tcfs/
This is basically crypto-support for NFS which is more integrated than
CFS (the T in TCFS stands for 'transparent').
