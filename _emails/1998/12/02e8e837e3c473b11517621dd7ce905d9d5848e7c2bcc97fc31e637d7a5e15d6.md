And you drop it at that point. No, you do not adequately discuss the
ramification of the economic nor of the social and historic motives to drive
the long-term archiving of all data in the network.

The current Eternity model is brittle in several ways. The problem is the
current economic model that all its supporters are wedded to. If that model
changes and takes on the range of responsibilities (some of them outside a
simple profit/cost approach) that such a service should carry it would work.

I made reference to a couple of these in my responce to Adam so I won't
reitterate them here.
