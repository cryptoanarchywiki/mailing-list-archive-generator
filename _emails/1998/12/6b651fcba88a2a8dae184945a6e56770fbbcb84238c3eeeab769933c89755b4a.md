You are missing my point.

Yes, it is possible that if power goes out, looting might occur.

I am now considering another possibility: what happens if the power DOES
NOT go out? What would the gunnuts do? Or, if the power does go out but
looting does not start, would the gunnuts shoot some blacks that they
mistake for "looters" but who are just walking down the streets?
