Dear Dr cypherpunks cypherpunks

Someone has used our password utility located at

http://chemweb.com/user_gateway/html/forgot_password.html

to request that the password for your account be sent to this email address
(the one that we have on file for your account).  If it wasn't you, don't 
worry, because no one can ever get your password except you (we only 
mail it to the email address on file).  Someone probably entered the 
wrong address by accident.

If it was you, then here's the information that you've been waiting for.

Your Member Name is: cypherpunks
Your Current Password is: crossfire

For additional help with technical problems, please see our online 
help guide at

http://chemweb.com/help/html/index.html
