  Not sure where this is from but:

   "The government already has DNA samples from all US citizens, why else
    do you think they kept the copper penny in circulation?" 

  I doubt copper can really collect DNA, and even if so, how they'd
correlate it with individuals, but with public health vaccinations and
(HMO at least) medical exams, the USG has had the opportunity to
collect DNA samples of a very large percentage of the population already.
