LIST OF DUAL-USE BIOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT
FOR EXPORT CONTROL

1. Complete containment facilities at P3, P4 containment level

Complete containment facilities that meet the criteria for P3 or P4 (BL3,
BL4, L3, L4) containment as specified in the WHO Laboratory Biosafety
manual (Geneva, 1983) are subject to export control. 

2. Fermenters*

Fermenters capable of cultivation of pathogenic micro-organisms, viruses or
for toxin production, without the propagation of aerosols, and having all
the following characteristics:


(a) capacity equal to or greater than 100 litres;
*Sub-groups of fermenters include bioreactors, chemostats and
continuous-flow systems.

3. Centrifugal Separators*

Centrifugal separators capable of the contiuous separation of pathogenic
micro-organisms, without the propagation of aerosols, and having all the
following characteristics:


(a) flow rate greater than 100 litres per hour;
(b) components of polished stainless steel or titanium;

(c) double or multiple sealing joints within the steam containment area; 

(d) capable of in-situ steam sterilization in a closed state.

*Centrifugal separators include decanters.

4. Cross-flow Filtration Equipment

Cross-flow filtration equipment capable of continuous separation of
pathogenic microorganisms, viruses, toxins and cell cultures without the
propagation of aerosols, having all the following characteristics:


(a) equal to or greater than 5 square metres;
(b) capable of in-situ sterilization.

5. Freeze-drying Equipment

Steam sterilizable freeze-drying equipment with a condensor capacity
greater than 50 kgs of ice in 24 hours and less than 1000 kgs of ice in 24
hours.

6. Equipment that incorporates or is contained in P3 or P4 (BL3, BL4, L3,
L4) containment housing, as follows:


(a) Independently ventilated protective full or half suits;
(b) Class III biological safety cabinets or isolators with similar
performance standards.

7. Aerosol inhalation chambers

Chambers designed for aerosol challenge testing with microorganisms,
viruses or toxins and having a capacity of 1 cubic metre or greater.

The experts propose that the following item be included in awareness
raising guidelines to industry:

1. Equipment for the micro-encapsulation of live micro-organisms and toxins
in the range of 1-10 um particle size, specifically:


(a) Interfacial polycondensors;
(b) Phase separators.

2. Fermenters of less than 100 litre capacity with special emphasis on
aggregate orders or designs for use in combined systems.

3. Conventional or turbulent air-flow clean-air rooms and self-contained
fan-HEPA filter units that may be used for P3 or P4 (BL3, BL4, L3, L4)
containment facilities.
