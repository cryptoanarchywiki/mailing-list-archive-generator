Paris and London had populations of over a million each and didn't have a
sewer system. It was traditional for people to throw their chamber pots out
into the street along with the offal from the various animals.

The reality is that the folks who support the various systems would have
them no manual over-ride within 24 - 48 hours so the worst case scenario
won't happen. Countries that aren't automated won't notice the difference
and the city services that are won't be down more than a week.
