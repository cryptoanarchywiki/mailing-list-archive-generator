The problem with the USPS is that it is government run -- like anything
government run, it doesn't work right.  It's too expensive, too slow, and
too unreliable.  Email, on the other hand, is largely handled by the private
sector.  Hence, it works better.  

What I find interesting (in response to your note that the USPS would
charge), is that the U.S. government had to actually pass a law to make sure
the U.S. government doesn't start taxing the Internet.

This would open the door for the USPS to charge for each email sent. 
The same rules? No. Based on those rules, but not the same rules.
The same rules would slow email down considerably also, wouldn't they???<g>
