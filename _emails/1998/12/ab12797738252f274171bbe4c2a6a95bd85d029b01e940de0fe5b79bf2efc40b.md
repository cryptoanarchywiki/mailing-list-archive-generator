Interestingly, the export control liason is not on the chart.  Perhaps 
this is a result of Whit pointing out in his book* that it was G2033,
an intelligence group.  One of its roles was to collect information to 
help other groups understand the technology they were looking at.

*Privacy on the Line, with Susan Landau, 1998.  If you haven't read
it, do.  I found it quite worthwhile and enjoyable.  Most cypherpunks
will already be familiar with most of whats there, but the footnotes
and asides are wonderful, and its a good compendium and overview.
