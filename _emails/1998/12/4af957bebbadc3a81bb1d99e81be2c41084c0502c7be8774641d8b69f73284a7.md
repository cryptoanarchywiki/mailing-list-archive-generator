The FBI is in between a rock and a hard-on here.

If anthrax spores really had been released into those air ducts, it could
potentially infect anyone in the building. They can't very well let these
people walk out when they might be carriers of antrax. That's the power of
bioweapons: Infect a bunch of people and they do the work of spreading it
for you.

>From a medical standpoint, it may be better to inject them with antibiotics
before the test results are back, in an attempt to increase chances of
survival. I can also understand the containment suits.

The fact that it can be done with a 25 cent phone call is funny.
