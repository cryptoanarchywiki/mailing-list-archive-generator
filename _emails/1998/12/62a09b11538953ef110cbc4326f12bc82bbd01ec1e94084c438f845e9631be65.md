Only if they can see it. Otherwise they'd need to execute a warrant to even
find it.

Park it in a garage or a niche in the backyard, problem solved.

There are legal restrictions on children buying anything. Technicaly the
sale isn't final without a guardians signature as co-signatory of the bill
of sale.

In most states the time limit and further instructions are on the vehicle
license. If you buy it via a loan then other terms may apply.

Unless it's an international license that is recognized by the US this isn't
true. Simply having a drivers license from England, for example, won't allow
you to drive a vehicle in any of the states anymore than your CA license
will let you drive legaly there.

Actualy as long as the owner isn't a resident (not the driver) and doesn't
stay in whatever state over some period set by the legislature then it is
permissible. In a lot of states it is between 30-90 days.

I'd bet the limit in CA is the residence time limit. I rather doubt that
anyone staying in CA 11 days automaticaly becomes a resident with a right
to vote in state elections and such.

It depends on the insurance limitations. My Bronco II is technicly
uninsured, and therefore illegal to drive, unless I am the driver.

In some cases even if the driver is licensed the owner still assumes
liability. At least here in Texas irrespective of who is driving the vehicle,
the owner is ultimately responsible for the vehicle. So if you loan it to
cousin Bippy and he has a wreck and runs away guess who gets to go to court
on leaving-the-scene charges. Now if you roll on Bippy the situation may
change.

Move to Texas. You can still drive your unregistred, uninspected vehicle on
your own property at your own speed and have wrecks at your convenience
(within the constraints of your deed restrictions of course). Way too many
bubba's still live in Texas for this sort of stuff to go over at all.
