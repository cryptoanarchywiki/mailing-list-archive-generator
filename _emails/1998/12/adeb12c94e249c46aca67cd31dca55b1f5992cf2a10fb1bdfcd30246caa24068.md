addresses like CompuServe, MCI, ANON's, etc.  This causes a 
tremendous amount of undeliverables.

After completion of removal of duplicates and initial filtering we were 
left with the base of 10 Million addresses worth fine tuning to finish the 
project.  Remember, we are not here to produce the CD with the gad zillion 
millions that our competitors are so proud to put their names on these days.  
We ARE here to produce the very BEST CD list as far as quality of 
addresses go

We then ran a program that contained 300+ keywords to remove addresses
with vulgarity,  profanity, sex-related names, postmaster, webmaster, flamer, 
abuse, spam, etc., etc.   Also eliminated all .EDU, mil, .org, .GOV, Genie, 
Delphi, GNN, Wow etc.   We also filtered out all addresses found in any of 
our 1300+ domains list.  We also filtered out addresses in excess of 30,000 
which have proven to be affiliated with anyone found to be opposed to our 
using direct bulk email as a advertising medium. We have also purged the 
list to be free of any "web poison" addresses created by those who are opposed 
to us conducting legitimate business on the internet today.  If you do not know 
what web poisoned addresses are, please look it up now.  One list we recently 
purchased had over 90% poisoned addresses.  The "bottom line" here is that 
you can go out on the world market today and purchase every lists for thousands 
of dollars and NOT have anymore worth owning than what we have compiled 
for you here today.

You use these addresses, you will experience increased response, increased 
sales, and a host of other positives that far exceeds any hoped for results when 
using the competitor's inferior products.  Our customers purchase our products 
over and over and over.  Most of the competition ever succeeds is selling a 
second product to anyone after they purchase the first.

  So, you see, our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all others that are 
out there on  CD and otherwise. Using ours will be like using the 200+ million that 
we started with, but a lot less money and a lot less time!!
 
We have always said, "You can buy from the REST or you can buy from the BEST".   
Your choice.

                       What others are saying:

"I received the CD on Friday evening.   Like a kid with a new toy, I
 immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses.  Over
 the course of the weekend, I emailed out over 500,000 emails and I
 received less than TWENTY undeliverables!!  I am totally satisfied
with my purchase!!  Thanks Premier!!"

                              Houston,  TX
 
 "This list is worth it's weight in gold!!  I sent out 100,000 emails for my
 product and received over 55 orders!

                ****************************************
 
                                 HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE
 
The CD is comprised of 7 million PREMIUM & SUPER clean addresses -ready 
for mailing upon receipt of the CD.  Each file contains exactly 100,000 email 
addresses. There are only AOL & Mixed addresses on this CD.  You have 50 files 
of 100,000 each of AOL to equal 5,000,000 addresses.  The AOL addresses are less 
than 6 weeks old and have been collected throughout the production schedule.
 
The remaining files are comprised of General Internet addresses. There are 20 files 
of 100,000 each, totaling 2,000,000 premium addresses.   NO Compuserve!  No Delphi!
No Genie!  No Prodigy!  NO Filler Addresses!  Simply the Best of the Best!!!

 
                           >>> ONLY $200.00!
 
This price is effective for the next seven days, thereafter the price will be
$299.00 so ORDER NOW!  Remember, bottom-line you always get what you pay for!

All lists are completely free of any Duplicates. We also on a continual basis, add 
New Names and Remove Undeliverables and Remove Requests. The result is the 
Cleanest Email Addresses Available Anywhere to use over and over again, for a 
FRACTION of the cost that other companies charge. Typical rates for acquiring 
email lists are from 1cent to as high as 3 cents per email  address - that's  
"INFORMATION HIGHWAY" ROBBERY!.

We continually work on our CD.  Who knows when those other CDs were made. 
We're constantly adding and deleting addresses, removes. Etc.  It all comes back 
to quality.
