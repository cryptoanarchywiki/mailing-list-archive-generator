The Highest court in Norway has freed a computer engineer from Norman Data
Defense Systems from charges relating to a computer break-in at the
University of Oslo in 1995. It acknowledged the fact that he broke in
through a security hole, but said it was not illegal for him to do so.

The court said that anyone who makes their computers available on the
internet should be prepared for the machines to accept "requests for
information contained on it". Ie, if its not protected well enough -- its
the owner of the machine who is to blame.
