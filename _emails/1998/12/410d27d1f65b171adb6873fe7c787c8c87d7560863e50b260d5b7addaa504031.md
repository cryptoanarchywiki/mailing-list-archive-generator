Is there a good archive of all the algorithms submitted for
AES?  I'd be interested especially in one that also had
info on what's been broken so far, plus implementations and
performance numbers. I can't find all this info on any one
site, but I can't believe that one doesn't exist.

Thanks!

Jim
