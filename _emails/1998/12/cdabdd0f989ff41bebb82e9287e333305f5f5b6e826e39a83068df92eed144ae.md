POTSDAM, Germany (AP) [12.26.98] - A German couple out for a
Christmas drive near Berlin ended up in a river - apparently 
because their luxury car's computer forgot to mention they 
had to wait for a ferry.
 
The 57-year-old driver and his passenger were not injured in 
the accident, police said Saturday.
 
Several companies sell computer navigators, some of which are 
attached to dashboards and serve as electronic road maps. Some 
offer traffic updates and Internet connections.

The German couple was out driving Friday night when they came 
to a ferry crossing at the Havel River in Caputh, six miles 
from Berlin.
 
That information, however, was never stored in the satellite
steered navigation system they were using, police said. The driver 
kept going straight in the dark, expecting a bridge, and ended up 
in the water.

River traffic was stopped for two hours while the car was fished 
out about 13 feet from the river bank.

``You can't always blindly rely on technology,'' a coast guard 
police officer said.

processes it. -- Grace Murray Hopper
