Right. If everyone used encryption, there would not as much public
debate about it.

For now, it is not commonly used and viewed as secrative.

Now for a general question to all that may read this: How much are
you willing to do something to change the laws?
However much people are willing to stick up for this issue is the
amount things could change.
