Meeting Notes:

   At the December meeting, if there's consensus that it's cold outdoors
   at 2 PM, we'll probably move to the Uno's Pizzeria or Chevy's on the top
   level of the Embarcadero Complex (not the top floor of the tower, more
   like the fourth floor, accessible via the escalators or elevators).

   Someone please bring a GPS unit!

   If you haven't seen it yet, "Enemy of the State" is playing in SF at:
     AMC Kabuki 8          1:30-5:00-7:45-8:10-10:35

     Empire 3             11:30-2:15-5:00-7:45-10:30

Location Info:

   Southbound on Market St. from the Embarcadero/Steuart.
   HARD RIGHT on Drumm St. (not left on Spear).
   Beat it down to Washington St. (a block or two).
   RIGHT on Washington, into cul-de-sac.
   You can almost smell us from there. Or the cookies.
   The best way to get to Mrs. Fields' is to park _under_ it in the
   Embarcadero 4 parking lot, accessible from the cul-de-sac.
   NOTE: Get your PARKING VALIDATED and it's FREE!
   
   Food (non-magic cookies) and beverages are available at Mrs. Fields'.
   There are several other places nearby to grab a snack during the meeting.

IMPORTANT HEADS-UP for January!

The January Physical Meeting WILL NOT be held on the usual second 
Saturday of the month, but rather on 16 January 1999 (the THIRD 
Saturday) to coincide with the RSA 1999 Data Security Conference
<http://www.rsa.com/conf99/> from 17-21 Jan), for which many cypherpunks
will be in town from all over the world.

We're currently scheduled (pending confirmation from the RSA 
conference chief, which seems likely) to have the meeting from 12 
Noon until 6 PM in the "B1" room (or possible "B2") in the SJCC (San 
Jose Convention Center), which is, conveniently, precisely where the 
RSA conference is being held.

Final meeting info will be available (here) at:
 <http://www.freedomfighter.net/cypherpunks/physical.html>

If you have any questions, please send them to the Jan co-organizers:
 Bill Stewart <bill.stewart@pobox.com>
 Dave Del Torto <ddt@lsd.com>
