           EE 579R, ADVANCED TOPICS IN CRYPTOGRAPHY

                       Spring `99 Semester
               WPI, Thursdays, 5:30-8:30pm, AK219
                 First day of class: January 21


                       COURSE DESCRIPTION

The course is a continuation of EE 578/CS 578, Cryptography and Data
Security. It will provide a deeper insight into several areas of cryptology
which are of great practical and theoretical importance. One focus of the
course is on techniques for efficient software and (to a somewhat lesser
extend) hardware implementations for public-key algorithms. The second focus
is on attacks against public-key schemes, which is fundamental for an
in-depth understanding of the choice of practical algorithms. Many techniques
will be introduced which are usually only treated in the research
literature.


                           SYLLABUS

Week 1: Introduction
Overview on practical public-key algorithms and efficient implementation
techniques. Efficient implementation of RSA: The Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Week 2: Selected public-key algorithms
Review of the generalized discrete logarithm problem and elliptic curve
cryptosystems.

Week 3: Efficient Implementation
Introduction to long number arithmetic.

Week 4: Efficient Implementation
Fast modular reduction algorithms.

Week 5: Efficient Implementation
Fast inversion algorithms.

Week 6: Efficient Implementation

method.

Week 9: Attacks
Attacking DL systems: Parallelization of Pollard's rho method.

Week 10
Topics TBA, depending on student interest. Possibilities are: Index-calculus
attack, differential cryptanalysis, correlation attacks, modern block cipher
design, Galois field arithmetic.

                        PREREQUISITES

The knowledge of the material of  EE 578/CS 578, Cryptography and Data
Security, is assumed (in particular with respect to public-key algorithms).
In addition, some experience with the C programming language is required.
