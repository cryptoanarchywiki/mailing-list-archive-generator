It could mean that a set of claims were allowed.  I have been involved in
several patents.  Generally, you submit the patent and then a year and a 
half later the patent office responds.  This is the "first office action."
Sometimes
the claims are rejeted, sometimes some of them are allowed.  Then you send
a letter back to the patent office, and maybe draft new claims.  Eventually
(there
may be a second office action) a series of claims are allowed, meaning that
they will be included in the patent.  It can be another six months before the
patent issues.

I expect that's what the L5 people were talking about.
