Actualy that is surprising since Open Sourse does not imply the loss of
rights by the author as public domain does.

If this is so and Germany interprets Open Source in this way then the OS
movement will fail in Germany (at least). There will be no motive for
authors to release their work since they will be in effect releasing all
rights to it, not the goal of OS at all. The impact on this for closed source
derivitive products is also of some interest.

I wonder what RMS will have to say on that one...
