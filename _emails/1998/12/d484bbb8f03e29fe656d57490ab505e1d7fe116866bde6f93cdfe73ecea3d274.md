The MIB have a convenient way around this. If you let them in voluntarily,
they're nice. If you make them get a warrant, they come back, guns drawn.
They barge in and tear the place up for hours. Maybe they'll hack down some
of the walls to search for drugs. In the end, you have something which is a
cross between a pile of papers, a bunch of dust, electronic parts, wiring,
torn up books, destroyed furniture, and a pile of crumbled drywall to call
home.
