Joy, just what we needed, a twist on the old source-routing packets.  A bad
idea within a bad idea. :(  Gee, how many of your routers allow source routed
packets these days?

To add to the above question, how big will the over head of the packets be?
How will the routers know that the packets aren't forged and that they contain
real micromoney and not already spent micromoney (possibly for the purposes of
denial of service attacks or other hacking attempts)?  
How will they do this in real time and not incur huge propagation delays?


IMHO, This has the words "Stupid Idea" written all over it.
