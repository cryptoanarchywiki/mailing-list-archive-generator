The Ministry of Information announces the following:

In order to ensure domestic tranquility and the maximum
protection of human rights by reducing crimes against humanity,
be it enacted that

- There shall be no whispering in public; you should have nothing
to hide unless you are a criminal

- You may not walk or gather in groups of two or more; such gathering
is an indication that you may be conspiring to commit some illegal act

- You may not have locks on your house; you should have nothing that you
are keeping from the collective

- You are not to draw the blinds or curtains in your house; law-abiding
citizens have nothing to hide

- All future voting will be by voice vote before the General Assembly; you
will also proclaim your support for the Party before casting your vote

- You will not think.  Free thought is for those that conspire against the
righteous government

- You will not associate with the Cypherpunks; they are enemies of those
that
would oppress you
