I agree that the primary damage, and resultant attention, is [necessarily]
focused upon those whom [indirectly] had the least to do with "inflicting"
this upon us (very accurately put), however, it is also the way most
likely to generate the necessary awareness of the issues.  Our biggest
problem isn't that Wassenaar is forced upon us by bureaucrats: our problem
is that hundreds of these types of things are forced upon us every year,
and *nobody cares*.  Our people have become so totally numbed and
apathetic, that if they are not "bitten" directly, they could care less.

I submit that this strike allows them to be bitten, albeit mildly, and
that this *may* (and may very well *not*) raise their attention level a
notch or two...

Yours,

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
