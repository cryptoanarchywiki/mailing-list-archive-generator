What would be the usefulness of this, anyway?  Most of us who know and care about this 
issue are already working in the field of cryptography or computer security at some
level--how will slowing our projects down by a day help our cause?  How will refusing
to design strong systems that use cryptography send a message to the government that
their meddling won't keep us from designing such systems?
