A BXA spokesperson said today that the text of the recent 
Wassenaar agreement had been received yesterday and it is 
now being prepared for release on the BXA website 
(www.bxa.doc.gov) maybe by the end of the week but maybe 
not until next week. She said she expected the US to be the 
first to publish the doc, after I cited the WA message below 
from Caspar Bowden.

She also said that the Practising Law Institute (www.pli.edu)
session on encryption controls yesterday was taped and inquiries 
should be made to PLI (a continuing legal ed org; ) 
1-(800) 260-4PLI. And that Bill Reinsch did not participate in 
the session, only gave the speech on Dec 7 noted here 
yesterday:

An inquiry to PLI (Betty Gray) has not been returned.

Mr. Weicke is still away, however, I can assure you that the Secretariat has
been recently authorized by all member states to publish the new Lists on
the web site.  This will be done as soon as possible.  Please be patient, we 
are a very small Secretariat.
