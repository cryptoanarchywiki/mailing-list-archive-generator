	In the first block he was talking about _normal_ _day_to_day_ water
usage. I was attacking that point.

	Not for long periods of time. General cleanlyness IS VERY important
in survival situations. Clean skin and clothes help prevent infections from
common wounds (like barking your shin against something, or a scratch from
a tree branch &etc.)

	Not in a crowded enviroment, that being a mid-sized town to a large
city.

	Countryside.

	Included in what? The pasta? The rice? The beans?

	I am not talking about a camping trip here, I am talking about
living off stored food for one to three months (anything longer (IMO) takes
VERY VERY different preperations.

	In a max survival do-or-die situation, yes. For long term health,
no. and besides, that was a number assuming "normal" usage.

	Why, so bacteria can fester, and things like dystensia (spelled
wrong, bacteria that causes "the shits" and other stomach problems) and
other diseases run rampant?

	I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that the biggest problem with
Y2K is not going to be technical, but the Cultists & Gun Nuts (as a
distinct group from survivalists who simply wish to get on with their
lives) realize that it isn't the Apocolypse, and then seek to make it so.

	Bet they tried to run you out of there, they don't want to hear
that kinda stuff, they want to hear how to get the most out of their 4X4,
argue over whether the AK is better than the M-16 (hint, if you have to
shoot more than a clip, you're fucked) for a "survival" situation.
