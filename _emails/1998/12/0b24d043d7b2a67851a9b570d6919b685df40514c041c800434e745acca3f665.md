Wherein David Friedman teaches cryptoanarchy 101 to the folks at the Cato
Institute.

A RealAudio transcription from the Cato/Forbes ASAP conference on
cryptography held earlier this year.

Listen to this. It's important. Even if you know what he's gonna say
already, it's a very good thing to have heard so you can point newbies to
it.

Cheers,
RAH
