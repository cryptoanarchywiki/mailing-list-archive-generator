Where? Where is there a country that has a social, economic, and legal
infrastructure of sufficient breadth but liberal views of speech to support
such an effort?

There are lots of little countries around but they have unstable
governments, no economy to speak of, limited telecommunications
infrastructure, etc.

It's fine and dandy to talk about this in the theoretic but the rubber has
to hit the road at some point.

There isn't such a country to be had.
