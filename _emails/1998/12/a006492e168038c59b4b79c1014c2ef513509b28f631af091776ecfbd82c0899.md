I would only add this caution.  I think John is wrong in giving legal 
advice that Wassenaar is not binding without implementing legislation.  
That is an American approach to these matters. I believe that many, 
perhaps most, Wassenaar members derive their authority to regulate 
exports directly from the arrangement itself.  For that reason, I would 
not assume that everyone everywhere is free to ignore the new 
restrictions until some further law or regulation is promulgated.
