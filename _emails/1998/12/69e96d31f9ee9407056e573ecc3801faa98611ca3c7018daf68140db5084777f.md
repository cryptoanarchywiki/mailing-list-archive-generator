Attendees of a meeting convened by the United Nations confirmed that while
central banking and telecommunications systems in many countries are making
progress toward Y2K compliance, many other necessary systems still need
help.  Those include electrical power systems, global shipping systems, the
linkages between telecommunications systems, and SWIFT, a system for
exchanging financial information.  The U.N. meeting was the first time top
Y2K officials were brought together.  "One of the goals of this meeting is
to identify the senior executives who are dealing with the problem," says
the chairman of the U.S. President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion.  "We
want the delegates to go home with a knowledge of faces and with agreements
on going forward.  We don't have time to go through normal diplomatic
channels."  More than 100 officials attended the meeting.  (TechWeb 14 Dec
