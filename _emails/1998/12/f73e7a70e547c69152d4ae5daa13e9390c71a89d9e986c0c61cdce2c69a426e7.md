5,000 years of human history bears this thesis out.

This is also their biggest weakness. It's one reason the US has never been
host to a large movement in the 20th century, outside the racist,
anti-communist, and pro-lifers (and the first two are pretty much dead)
because your neighbor probably doesn't go to the same church you do, probably
not from the same part of the country. The chances of an individual opening
up to their neighbor and getting a warm reception for bombing someplace is
pretty low.

Realisticaly, the only reason the pro-lifers get as warm a reception as they
do is so many people see it as hypocritical. It's ok to kill a killer is
their thinking, it is after all a form of pre-partum assissted self-defence.

Considering the rate at which they occur now there is zero rational reason
to believe these groups will cease any time in the near future.
