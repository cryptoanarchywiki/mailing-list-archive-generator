I'm afraid you're confused.  Whoever this report was about, it
wasn't me:

* I'm not at Lucent Bell Labs. (I'm at AT&T Shannon Labs.)  I'm not
  aware of any other Blaze at either AT&T or Lucent, however.
* I'm not a mathematician. (I'm a computer scientist.)
* I've not been to ORD, or any other midwestern airport,
  since August.  (I do fly a lot, though).
* I never been arrested.  (I did accently set off the antitheft
  detector at a local bookstore once, but they let me go
  when I showed them my reciept).
