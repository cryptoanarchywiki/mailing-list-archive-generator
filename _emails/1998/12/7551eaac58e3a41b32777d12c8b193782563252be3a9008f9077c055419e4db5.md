>From a DoJ press release 15 December 1998:

High-tech crime

  The G8 countries have established a 24 hour network of 
law enforcement experts capable of responding swiftly to 
requests for help with investigations that cross international 
borders, including hacking cases. The network, which is 
now in use, is open to wider membership and a number of 
non G8 countries have already joined. The Lyon Group is 
pursuing consultations with industry, including internet 
service providers, on preventing criminal use of networks 
and ensuring traceability of their communications. It is also 
developing proposals for a legal framework for retrieving 
electronic evidence swiftly in cases that cut across 
international borders.
