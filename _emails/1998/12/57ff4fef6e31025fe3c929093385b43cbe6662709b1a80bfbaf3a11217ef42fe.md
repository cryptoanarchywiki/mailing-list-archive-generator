I didn't want to incur two matters (hence my way of formulation):

1. The law would sometime be effective in my country without my
   immediately noticing it and I'll get trobles.

2. I am not sure that my stuff is really strong. Saying that I
   have to delete because it is strong is claiming something
   at least very subjectively and anyway not scientific.

Do you understand now?
