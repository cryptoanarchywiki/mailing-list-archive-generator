"We just intercepted a coded transmission from Earth Force Command. They've
started bombing Mars! I repeat, they're bombing Mars!"

(scene of two fighters on approach to a biodome)

Omega One: "Standing by. Weapons hot."
Radio: "Don't do it! We have women and children down here! Don't do it!"
Radio2: "Omega One, you are clear for drop."

(weapons fly, killing a few thousand innocent men, women, and children.)

It amazes me how much similarity Babylon 5 has to reality. Is Clinton a fan
who fancies himself as President Clark? I'm starting to worry.
