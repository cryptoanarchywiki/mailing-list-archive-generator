I believe that a mass strike only hurts our employers, not the gov'ts
that are afflicting us with crap like Wassenaar. I propose that we
designate Monday "International Export Crypto Day". We should pick a
gov't agency or member (in a gov't other than our own) and email crypto 
to him/her. Mass effort will demonstrate the absolute idiocy of
regulations like Wassenaar. maybe even a mass chain letter with RSA in 3
lines of perl emailed all over the world and forward via typical chain
letter mechanisms. 

so
