I must have missed this one. Could anyone provide some greater detail on
what the mod_ssl.c issue was with Sameer & C2Net?


FWIW I have a couple of projects that I am working on that are dependent
on the SSLeay Libs. If I don't like the way Sameer or C2Net is going with
this I will just continue my own development on the Libs.
