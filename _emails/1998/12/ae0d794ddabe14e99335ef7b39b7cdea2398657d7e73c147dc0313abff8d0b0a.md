"The Machinery of Freedom" far from being published in the early '80s
was published in 1971 and is based on writings from the late '60s.

It is very much aimed at 60s alternative types a with relaxed writing
style, anti-drug law and pro freedom line.

This book when I read it through FCS in the early '80s convinced me I was a 
libertarian.  I didn't come across cypherpunk theory until much 
later and, when I did, I saw it obviously followed libertarianism.

I am sure Friedman was well aware on how technological advances could
weaken the state and to accuse him of "copying" is facile.
