John Gilmore has proposed setting up crypto archives in
many countries to avoid Wassenaar restriction problems.
Does anybody have a good source for information on web hosting providers
or other ISPs in a variety of countries around the world?
Shell accounts are nicer, because it's easier to create
servers that check where the request is coming from,
for countries that insist you only provide access to their citizens
but still allow you to do that on a web site.  The US doesn't
appear to have strictly defined legal requirements for such sites (YET)
and places like MIT have gotten quite flexible about it.

Also, are there any good sources of relatively private VISA
credit cards, preferably outside the US, that can be used
to rent computer accounts with?

There are other crypto distribution methods that, while slower,
are still legal from the US - censoring printed books embarasses
them a bit still, though some other countries don't have
the same squeamishness even though they may be less interested
in banning the material.  Printing PGP source books was annoying,
but a week's delay in shipping few-page crypto subroutines
isn't that serious, especially if it's in a scanner-friendly format.

Any guess how the various countries feel about faxes of source code?

And, of course, shipping or even selling source for 40-bit RC4
and 512-bit RSA is pretty simple, even if you don't include the note
"WARNING: DO NOT CHANGE THE #define KEYLENGTH TO 128 OR THE
#define MODULUSLENGTH TO 2048 AND RECOMPILE"
				Thanks!
