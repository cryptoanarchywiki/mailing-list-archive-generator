Don't you mean "Iraqui" Embassy?

Or is this thing spreading? I hope not.

Comrade Klinton is no worse than Comrades Hyde, Ingliss, Gingrich,
Coble, Bono, well you know the rest. They all call themselves statesmen
but they are pretty damned pedestrian.

****************

Comrade Klinton just started another bombing run, curiously after it
became
widely known that the impeachment hearings wouldn't be delayed until
next
week. So far, every target hit has been in camera range. NBC said that
the
Iranian Embassy might have been hit by a Tomahawk.
