Sorry for all the questions but I've been
away from crypto for a while and I'm
looking for the best encryption program
for exchanging email between Unix and
Windows folks. I hope these questions are
appropriate here.

What do people generally think about S/MIME ?
Is it well designed (strong and extendable) ?
Is it convenient because its available in
the popular email clients ?
Is the most annoying thing about it that
you have to pay for the keys ?
Is there a way to self-sign keys ? SSLeay ?
Are most people still using PGP ?
If IDEA and MD5 (and PGP2.6.2) are not strong
enough anymore, what are the Unix folks
using ? Does the source for PGP5/6 compile
to any target besides Windoze ?

Thanks
