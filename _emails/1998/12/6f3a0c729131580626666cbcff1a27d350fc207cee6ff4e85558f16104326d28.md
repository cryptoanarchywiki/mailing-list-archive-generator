Mako Capital (Mako) .74 trades on the OTC bulletin board. 
The stock is deeply discounted and on sale at current share prices. There
is reason to believe that the merger with sports group international
will be completed the week of December 7th. If this information is 
accurate, Mako stock could see significantly higher prices in the near
term. In addition, their are rumors that additional orders for their
Spalding Sports Drink should bring the total number of cases pre-sold
for 1999 up to approximately 2 million cases. That translates into 
approximately 25 million in revenue for 99. The stock could easily trade
back to 2.25 or higher based on that kind of revenue.
