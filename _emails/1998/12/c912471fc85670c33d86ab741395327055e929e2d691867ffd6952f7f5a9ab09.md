A number of attempts have been made to apply chaos to cryptosystems.  The two
that I've broken suffered from the same fault: although it's difficult to find
the precise starting point (key) due to sensitive dependence, chaotic systems
are by definition non-random, and have preferred orbits.  If the cryptanalyst
finds an orbit that's close to the one used by the actual key, the stream is
mostly the same; this is good enough to hone the attack for the next pass.

I'm not saying chaos has no applications in cryptography; only that the
applications are not obvious.
