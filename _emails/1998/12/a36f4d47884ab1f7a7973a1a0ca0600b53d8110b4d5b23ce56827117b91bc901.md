Hello Joey et all,

Now that L5 has been patented, will you and your colleagues at Jaws
Technology make the L5 algorithm details available to the professional
cryptography community for independant verification. Could you also
provide the Canadian and/or US patent numbers?

(Announcement of L5 patent:
<http://www.newswire.ca/releases/October1998/27/c6731.html>)

To cypherpunks readers, the free "shareware" version is available from:
<http://www.jawstech.com/products/jawsl5/download-free-trial/L5_ShareWare_Setup..exe>

I think the coderpunks readers might enjoy playing with this program. It
has proven entertaining so far for me.
