This sounds like some legalistic spin-doctoring from the KRA to try to
minimize the political impact of the departure.  Are they really claiming
that the KRA did not exist as late as December, 1997?  See their own press
release at http://www.kra.org/clips/alliance2.html, dated October 2,
1996, describing the formation of the KRA.  See also the McAfee press
release at http://www.nai.com/about/news/press/1996/121296.asp, dated
December 12, 1996, saying that McAfee was joining the KRA, and the KRA
press release http://www.kra.org/clips/prkeyrec0597.html from May, 1997,
welcoming 22 new members.

Perhaps their story is that prior to December, 1997, the KRA had enough
existence for companies to join, but not enough for them to withdraw?

Keep in mind that the KRA is apparently trying to put a particular spin
on events, as is clear from their strained attempt to claim that NAI never
withdrew because their was "no entity from which to withdraw."  They want
to maximize the appearance of commercial support for their organization.

The membership applications they are referring to may just be the
paperwork needed to officially transfer the membership from TIS to NAI.
This would represent NAI's decision to continue to be a member of the
KRA but would not be a matter of joining anew; rather it would maintain
the existing relationship inherited from TIS.
