1. What is the point of the obfuscation? If it's not legal to do it
openly, then it's certainly not legal to hide the fact your doing it.
"The accused did it in such a way as to demonstrate that he was aware
of it's illegality".

2. By your example, you could also take a cruise missile apart, and
ship each part separately. After all, none of it is actually a missile.

However I 'export' PGP from the US, I'm exporting it, even if I have a
web site for each bit, 0 or 1 being determined by whether Clinton has
a cigar or not in a posted picture.
Yes, the law is inconsistent (let alone stupid). Not, I wouldn't want
to try this and expect to be immune from prosecution.
