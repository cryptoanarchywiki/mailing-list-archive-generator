A survey by the National Association of Counties shows that one-third of
the nation's counties aren't even aware of the Y2K problem -- and about 75% of
the 119 counties with populations below 10,000 haven't developed a plan for
updating their computer systems to deal with the millennial data change.
Total Y2K spending among counties is expected to reach $1.7 billion,
according to the association.  (Information Week 14 Dec 98)
