I believe that there will be free havens for crypto for some time to come.
Crypto is too obscure a topic to be outlawed worldwide anytime soon. So
the Canadian entrepreneurs Tim is referring to and others determined to
ship crypto will be able to do so for many, many years by simply
relocating development to other countries.

Just as there are small countries that don't play ball with FINCEN, there
will be small countries that don't play ball with crypto regs and be that
because that's the countries only significant source of hard cash.
