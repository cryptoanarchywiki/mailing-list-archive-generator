Even if I hadn't read "The Hot Zone," "The Coming Plague," "The Cobra
Event," and various other CBW books and articles, and even if I hadn't
visited the CDC and other Web sites, I would have known from news reports
that the trick to using anthrax as a weapon is to properly disperse the
spores.

Human to human contact is a poor way to disperse these spores. Eating the
flesh of anthrax-infected humans _may_ spread the spores, but data are too
sparse to verify this.
