The All Seeing Eye

What I propose, as a potential prank, is to include the following phrases 
in signature files on messages for a while. I'm sure the DoD will be annoyed.
It's a bit long, so ignore if you want to.

Throwing sand in the All-Seeing Eye

by Paul McGinnis (original article posted April 24, 1994)
(this is an article about my plan to have fun with paranoid people in the 
US government)

I've often wondered if various entities of the US government monitor the 
public messages in newsgroups such as this or monitor unencrypted 
electronic mail. I've worked in the communications industry since 1987 
and I know how easy it is to monitor digital communications
-- in fact, it is often necessary to monitor data communications to find 
problems in the hardware or software.

There have been rumors that NSA can scan international links for keywords 
like "MX missile" or "Stealth bomber". It's very easy to set up this kind 
of filter program -- for instance, if you mention
Kibo in a Usenet public message, he will respond. With that in mind, I'd  
like to propose an experiment (maybe prank is a better description...). 
The following is a list of phrases that are put at the beginning of 
classified files by the US government. They are taken from Department of
Defense manual DOD 5220.22-M and Title 32, Section 2001 Code of Federal 
Regulations.

Note: comments are placed between square brackets, i.e. [this is a comment].

My experiment is to see what happens if you start putting some of these 
at the beginning of your Internet messages...

(TS)
[markings shown in parentheses are accepted abbreviations. For example, 
you could just put (TS)
on a document, instead of TOP SECRET]
