You are missing the point completely -- there is no reason to suppose
that people, left to their own devices, would do anything other than
what people left to their own devices have already done, which is to put
in place all the present systems of law and government. The problem for
both your point of view and that of the "anarcho-whatevers" is that
there is no need to speculate about what an anarchy would look like, we
already have one. It's just that it doesn't resemble what either of you
thinks an anarchy should be.

Cheers,
