The sheeple don't care. The government has waged an effective propaganda
campagne and only BadPeople (tm) get their property confiscated. Just like
only BadPeople (tm) drink and drive, or consume unapproved plants, or
smoke, or think BadThoughts (tm), ...ect.

The sheeple have shown time and time again that they are unworthy of
freedom and democracy that so many better men have fought and died for.
There will not be any popular outcry against this or any other
infringements by the sheeple, they are much more interested in worrying
about cum stains on party dresses (or whatever the latest circus has to
offer).
