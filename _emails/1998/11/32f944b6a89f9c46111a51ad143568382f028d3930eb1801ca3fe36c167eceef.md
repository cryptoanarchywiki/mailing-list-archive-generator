Nothing is more American than a hot bowl of Chili, but if you ask 
a hundred people about how to make the best bowl of chili you'll 
probably get a hundred different answers.

America's Best Chili Recipes hopes to help answer this question 
by offering fifty of the most diverse Chili recipes that you will 
find anywhere. Plus, these recipes don't come from any sterile 
kitchen test labs, but from the family picnics,backyard 
barbecues, and tailgate parties of Chili lovers from across 
America. 

Our book is divided into four separate chapters:

Chapter I	Traditional Chili 
Chapter II	Chili with Beans
Chapter III	Low Fat/Vegetarian Chili
Chapter IV	Prize Winners			


Among the recipes you'll enjoy are:

***Barbecue Chile from New Jersey
***Lobster Chili from Maine
***Seven Pepper Chili from San Antonio
***Kosher Chili from New York 
***Nuclear Chili from San Francisco

In addition, with each recipe you'll get the story behind the 
recipe. Each contribution contains an entertaining story or 
anecdote from the person who sent the recipe. 

Read about:

*** The Ghost in the Chili Pot
*** The Secret behind Comet Chili
*** Chili passed down through three generations of LA Firemen

Buy the book for the recipes, or buy it for the stories. You'll 
find that there is a chili recipe for every finicky eater.
