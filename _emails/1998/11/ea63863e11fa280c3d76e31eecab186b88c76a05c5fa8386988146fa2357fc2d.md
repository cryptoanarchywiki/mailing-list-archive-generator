Your right, let me spell it out. Free-markets as depicted by
anarcho-whatever theories legitimize theft, physical violence, extortion,
etc. They further a priori abandon any precept of social institution and
leave it all on the shoulder of the individuals. Additionaly they abandon
such concepts of justice, equity, etc. because they describe no mechanism
to handle these issues. And finaly, they don't even attempt to recognize
the international interactions and cultural differences that drive them.

They make the same mistake as every other form of non-democratic system,
they assume because it works for one it works for all.

Not even hardly. At least citizens can change the laws under a democracy.
Under an anarcho-whatever it is strictly lump it or like it unless you're
willing to fund a bigger gun.

Ask the humans who are being traided or the peson the property was stolen
from.

I'm going to stop now, this particular vein of discussion is bereft of any
and all positive attributes when one tries to justify slavery and theft.

Like I said, at least your more honest than the rest of these wanna-be
thieves.

You might want to see doctor about that hole you shot in your foot while
it was in your mouth.
