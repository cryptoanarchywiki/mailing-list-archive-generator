Government subcontracting can be yet another excuse for graft and kickbacks
or it can be an opportunity for the private sector to seriously compete 
for government business, or at least an opportunity to compete for graft :-)
Sometimes this can save money for the public, though seldom as much
as letting services be provided by the private sector.

Of course they are, and everybody's pretty much known it all along,
but "defense" was the excuse used for having the Feds get into the
road-building business on a much more massive scale than ever before.
Much of it corresponded nicely with "urban renewal", the 60s policy
of making cities more beautiful by replacing black peoples' houses with
freeways.  Once (white) people got used to freeways, they mostly
stopped complaining about expenditures, and started complaining that
they didn't have _their_ freeway yet.

No, but the industrial base that keeps the military functioning
does benefit from the highway system.

Excuse me?  Are you talking about some recent attack on Mexico,
or are you referring to the Mexican War of 1846?
Or are you contending that the Confederate States weren't part of the
Contiguous United States, and therefore the Union's ReConquest 
of the South wasn't in CONUS?  Or that the Indian wars in the west
weren't wars, just Police Actions, or that the various ex-Mexican
territories weren't States yet, and thus not CONUS?



				Thanks!
