Start a political party, but the likes of which has never walked the face of
the Earth.

The individual states when acting in a clear majority (>=75%) may pass
Constitutional amendments without the involvement or interference of federal
processes.

The IRS, for example, could be shut down tomorrow or significantly modified
via this mechanism without involvement at the federal level.

What is needed is a political party that has a representative site in each
state capital. Their job is to get proposed amendments to the Constitution
on the floor of each body for vote.

Think nationaly, act by state.

There could be no appeal to the Supreme Court for constitutionality because
it IS the Constitution.

There are no requirements in the Constitution to notify or otherwise
register such acts with the federal authorities. In short, it's none of
their business if the people acting at the state level change the laws at
the federal level. They must either comply or quit their jobs.
