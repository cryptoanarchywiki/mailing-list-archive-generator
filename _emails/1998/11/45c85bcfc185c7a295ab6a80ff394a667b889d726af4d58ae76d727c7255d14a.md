My reading is the same as yours -
the law was written carelessly, and wrong (unless JYA forgot the paragraph defining
"mass" as "intended to kill more than N people", but it doesn't look like it.)
That means that any chemical weapon, including your can of mace or pepper spray,
that might be construed as causing "serious bodily injury",
makes you a terrorist using weapons of mass destruction.
Might get worse - lead _is_ toxic, and causes injury by impact.
It's a bad law, and it's going to be abused, and this case is 
a great one for the Feds to use to set bad precedent with,
since the Republic of Texas are a bunch of incompetent wackos.

Not sure, but it means that the Feds aren't terrorists if _they_
threaten or conspire to use weapons of mass destruction,
but you would be if you did.  It also probably means that 
foreign governments aren't covered here, but foreign NGOs are,
e.g. the IRA.

>> interstate commerce
The standard clause used to give the Feds jurisdiction over things;
given Roosevelt-era courts deciding that a farmer feeding his own grain
to his own hogs affects interstate commerce, surely email or the
World Wide Web counts as interstate, as does killing anybody
who might cross state lines or buy some product that does.
(Of course, given the number of politicians who are for sale,
removing a few of them from the market can pretty legitimately
be called affecting interstate commerce :-)
