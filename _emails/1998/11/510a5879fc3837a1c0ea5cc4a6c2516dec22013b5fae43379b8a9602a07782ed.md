COURSE TITLE: Computer Encryption/Decryption

LENGTH OF PRESENTATION: 

Lecture  Laboratory  Practical Exercise  Total  
2:00  2:00  2:00  6:00  

 DESCRIPTION:

Advancing computer technology, coupled with a growing user awareness of
privacy and security issues, has resulted in the widespread use of program,
electronic mail, and data file encryption techniques. Today seemingly all
sophisticated applications have their own optional encryption schemes
including WordPerfect, Word, Lotus, Excel, and a host of others. The
computer investigator can expect to encounter encrypted (unreadable) files
when examining seized computer evidence. This course demonstrates software
tools which will enable the student to decreypt many different files, and
examines features of the most commonly used encryption/decryption tool used
today: PGP.
