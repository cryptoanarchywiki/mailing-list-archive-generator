--------------------------------

I am a government contractor and have had my problems with this enumeration
demonization and now find that the alarms are rising. A close friend of
mine, who is a government employee sent this copy of an unclassified message
from the Commander of Naval Surface Pacific Command to all forces of the
Pacific command. Undoubtedly, this is also true for the Atlantic Fleet as
well as the rest of the military under the control of the Commander in
Chief. I think Ayn Rand was correct when she said, "Justice vanished from
the country when the gold coins vanished from the country's hands." It
appears that sooner than not, we will "not be able to buy or sell except he
that has the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here
is wisdom. Let he that has understanding calculate the number of the beast:
for it is the number of a man [His DNA?]; and his number is 666." [the
helical make-up?] Revelations 13: 17 & 18.

May God grant us the wisdom we all need for discernment in this matter.
