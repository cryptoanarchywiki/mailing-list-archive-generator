What is annoying is "charity" (social security) at the point of a gun.
Our "conscience" is being decided by government which is acting as a
broker for those lobby for their "need" and for your assets to be
stolen and redistributed to them.

What people aren't willing to pay for shouldn't happen.  Period.  If
that means people starve well those complaining loudest had better
dig deeper into their pockets.

Anything else is socialism tending to facism, as Hayek argues in The
Road to Serfdom.

That's what's so interesting about cyberspace, once the payment
systems get there -- government thugs can't beat up, murder, or
incarcerate anonymous nyms.  _Then_ Jim's "No state can govern those
who don't wish to be governed" starts to become true.
