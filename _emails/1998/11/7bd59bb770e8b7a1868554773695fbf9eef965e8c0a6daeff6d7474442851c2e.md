	And despite this, and his having large numbers of lawyers on his
side, and despite having large quantities of cash to persue advertising,

	LINUX IS KICKING HIS ASS IN THE SERVER MARKET, and poised to do the
same on the desktop.

	Linux had little corporate funding (some Government thru it's
subsidies of colleges and the internet), almost no advertising, and no, or
negative mindshare until recently.

	Ah, but if we let HIM, then we'd have that shot as well.

	He is not a monster, he is just doing what many other businessmen
have done down thru the years.

	You assume that people will always be shooting. Most will figure
out that guns really aren't an economical solution to most problems.

	Remember the "Bad, Bad" wild west? Well, it seems that despite what
the movies tell you, you are more likely to get shot today in parts of
Chicago or LA than in most of the Old West. Why? Guns really don't pay as a
wealth _getter_, only as a wealth keeper.

	By that comparison, so is life.
