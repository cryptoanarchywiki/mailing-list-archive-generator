This comment on NAI's KRA(P) membership by Will Price
<wprice@pgp.com>, a crypto type who works for PGP was forwarded to the
ukcrypto list by Ian Goodyer (uk-crypto list admin).  Not sure where
it was posted originally, or perhaps Will asked Ian to forwarded it.

Here is a response from Will Price who was formally from PGP inc and now of
course is with NAI.   ian

I've commented about this on this list before I believe.  This appears
to be a case of really old news suddenly being dredged up for no
apparent wholesome reason -- which strikes me as quite odd because
Wired was apparently so eager to break this ancient story that they
didn't wait to ask anyone from NAI about it.

NAI being listed on the KRA page is *solely* a result of our TIS
acquisition.  I really doubt anyone here actually called some KRA
person and officially renewed our membership.  Frankly, I doubt anyone
here actually knows who to talk to there -- if there even is a
"there".  As I have said before, due to the TIS acquisition, NAI now
has a bunch of products which contain key escrow features. 
Eliminating or modifying these features such that they work in a less
big brother-like fashion will take significant time -- indeed entire
TIS products were based around managing key escrow infrastructures. 
Don't get me wrong, TIS had a lot of other great products, but it will
take time to redesign and rethink some of them in the context of
export and key escrow.  I'm not sure there's much point in withdrawing
from KRA when those products still exist.

These issues have no effect whatsoever on the PGP group.  As always,
we continue to publish full source code which effectively solves all
the export issues for us.
