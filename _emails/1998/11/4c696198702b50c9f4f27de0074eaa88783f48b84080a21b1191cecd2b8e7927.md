Crack open your palm pilots and take note!  And please repost widely.  Our
mailing list (dccp@eff.org), along with the rest of eff.org, is sadly out
of commission.

DC Cypherpunks will hold a meeting at the Electronic Privacy Information
Center office in Washington, DC.

DATE:  Soon!  Saturday, November 21, 1998

TIME:  5pm

Featured speaker:  Richard Schroeppel, University of Arizona
		   rcs@cs.arizona.edu

The Hasty Pudding Cipher

"NIST is organizing the search for a new block cipher, the Advanced
Encryption Standard.  The Hasty Pudding Cipher is my entry in the AES
competition.  The design goals for HPC are medium security, speed, and
flexibility.  Hasty Pudding works with any block length and any key
size.  It is optimized for 64-bit architectures, operating at 200 MHz
on large data blocks.  Hasty Pudding introduces a new feature, Spice,
which allows useful non-expanding encryption of small blocks, even
single bits.  The cipher includes some unusual design principles."


Location:  Electronic Privacy Information Center
	   666 Pennsylvania Ave. SE,
	   at the corner of Pennsylvania and 7th in South East DC
	   Across the street from Eastern Market Metro station (Orange &
  	   Blue Line)

To get into the building, go around to the 7th street side next to the
flower shop and use the call box to call the EPIC office.  We'll buzz you
in.

True to DCCP form, we'll probably hit a local resturaunt afterwards for
dinner.

If you need more explicit directions, please contact Kathleen Ellis at
(202)298-0833 or ellis@epic.org.
