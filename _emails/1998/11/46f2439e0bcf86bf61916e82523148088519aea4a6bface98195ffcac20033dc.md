Agreed, but that's a different issue. Here we're talking about
deliberately inserted back doors. Those can get extremely nasty, and may
be unpatchable. Examples include "data kidnap" (encrypting the target's
information in situ and demanding a ransom for the decryption key), and
"data cancer" (slow corruption of the target's information, ensuring
that the backups are also corrupted). Quickly patching the software that
delivers those attacks isn't anough--you need a defence against it being
introduced and activated in the first place. I haven't heard of any real
examples of such attacks, but that's not especially comforting.

Cheers,
Frank O'Dwyer.
