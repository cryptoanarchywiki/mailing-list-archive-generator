Finally, some real meat for a bankruptcy/technology lawyer.  I've 
been predicting for some time now that technology 
companies will start to use the bankruptcy process as the industry 
starts to shake out.  The PR aside, these filings are generally 
prompted by one or more strata of large debt obligations or 
convertable securities, and the company's inability to continue to 
make required payments.  What DigiCash will probably do is 
restructure its existing debt structures while seeking partners to 
obtain additional cash flows needed to continue operations.

I'll be interested to see how it all works out.
