Don't confuse the views you hear from some particular person(s) to be the
collective, group views of the list, or the views of me, and so on. (This
applies to your point below about porn, too.)

You seem to think the Cypherpunks mailing list is some kind of moderated,
edited forum, with porn ads sent deliberately by the Governing Body of
Editors.

What goes out to the *reflector* is what comes in. Nothing more, nothing less.

You are of course free to create your own moderated, edited list.

Oh, and please learn to attach Subject names to your posts. And
"cypherpunks@toad.com" is not one of the preferred list addresses...hasn't
been for a year or two.
