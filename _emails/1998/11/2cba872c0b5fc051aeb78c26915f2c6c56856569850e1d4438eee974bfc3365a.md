Jim,

you said...
*****
If you do decide to stake your laptop as refered above there are a few
things to know....

 -      Make sure the stake is in suitable ground without lots of quartz
        and other similar peizo-electric materials.

 -      The stake should extend at least 3ft. into the ground.

 -      When the stake is driven in, the ground should be thoroughly
wetted
        which usualy means quite a bit of water (30 gals or so should do
        it), if possible wet it over a 24 hour period prior to staking.

 -      Make sure the stake and the cable leading to the laptop are
copper
        (or silver if you're rich)

 -      You don't want to be close to phone, power, and other sorts of
        underground utilities.
****

Please explain to me why it matters that the box be grounded!

Radiated energy from chips and traces is independent of your mongo
ground strap to the mother ship. All the strap does is alter the DC
potential. Shield your box well but design out the leg irons and the
geological requirements.
