Ok, so this one says it was Goldbach himself and in particular states two
odd primes completely eliminating 4 from the get go ...

This one is the second version...

And finaly a third completely different slant. They at least get Fermats
contribution right.

Well I'd say that all three of your references tended to contradict each
other. Which one do you want to stand on?

This is my quote:

I'll stand by this statement.
