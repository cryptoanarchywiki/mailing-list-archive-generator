Cabe Franklin <cabe.franklin@cbpr.com> forwards this statement from Wes
Wasson, director of marketing for Network Associates' security division:

>"NAI officially withdrew from the Key Recovery Alliance in late 1997. In May
>of 1998, NAI acquired Trusted Information Systems, which had been an active
>member of the KRA. NAI subsequently reliquished the leadership role TIS had
>taken in the organization. NAI Labs' TIS Advanced Research Division
continues
>to monitor the KRA's activities from a technical perspective, but Network
>Associates in no way advocates mandatory key recovery."
