The PGP 6.0 Manual is available in french
-----------------------------------------


The User's Guide of the cryptographic application PGP 6.0 (Windows version)
has been translated in french by some users from the newgroup
fr.misc.cryptologie.

The document is in Acrobat PDF format and can be downloaded freely at these
URL :


http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/9648/intimite.htm

and soon mirrored on:


http://www.fortunecity.com/skyscraper/oracle/598/intimite.htm

PGP 6.0 freeware has been published in USA in the early september by
Network Associates, Inc. In spite of the US regulations prohibiting the
export of strong cryptography softwares, unknowns have exported PGP 6.0 in
Europe by email. The french is at this time the single language in which
the PGP 6.0 manual has been translated.

In the eyes of the french laws, the use of PGP 6.0 is prohibited on the
extent of the french territory. But his holding in France and his
importation from a country member of the European Union are perfectly legal.

(IMPORTANT : the text of this Manual stays the property of Network
Associates Inc. (NAI). NAI has not given his agreement for this
translation, which is provided by his authors only temporaly, waiting for
an official french version by NAI)
