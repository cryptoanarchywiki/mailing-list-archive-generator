No, you can't.  I've got some sample Kong documents below.
(Be sure to get the US version of Kong from http://catalog.com/jamesd/kong/
rather than the somewhat older version from replay (which you get
if you tell James's page you're not a US/Canadian citizen.
Some UnAmerican should hack their way through James's protection
and update replay's version.))

If you check the signature on a document identical to one
you've already got stored, it'll tell you about it, and list
all the usernames that have signed that document.

When you try to store a second key with the same name as an existing key,
it'll tell you that they're different, and let you add a note to the new one.
(Unfortunately, it doesn't also let you add a note to the first one;
a nice feature change would be to always ask for notation when
receiving a new key.)  

(It's a bit hard to test on one machine, since you tend to step
over yourself in the process, but it should work fine in a clean environment,
and Kong is very tolerant of having its Kong.mdb file blown away
and doesn't even mind some editing using MS Access, though YMMV.)

Kong lets you sign a document in different modes -
in one mode, the document can't be modified after signing,
and in other modes you can change whitespace or linebreaks,
making it more tolerant of different email environments.

By the way, you don't want to hit the "view" button
after checking this one - you'll get 
Run-Time Error 3021 - No current Record
and then Kong dies.
