DigiCash Inc. to File Reorganization, Seeks Partners to Drive eCash Forward

PALO ALTO, CALIF.--November 4, 1998

DigiCash Inc. has announced that it is entering into a Chapter 11
reorganization to allow it to pursue strategic alternatives for its
electronic cash ("eCash" (tm)) products and the associated intellectual assets
pioneered by DigiCash.

According to Scott Loftesness, interim CEO of DigiCash, "The company is
exploring a range of potential alternatives including working with major
strategic players to finance the market development of eCash or the sale
and/or licensing of the Company's intellectual property portfolio."
Loftesness added, "eCash(tm), as it has been developed by DigiCash, is an
important and inevitable payment solution in the world of global electronic
commerce."

The DigiCash payment solution is currently in use by leading banks in Europe
and Australia.  These banks have deployed the DigiCash eCash solution and
continue to add to their respective consumer and merchant eCash acceptance
networks.

DigiCash's eCash(tm) payment solution offers a secure, low cost and private
payment option to consumers for payments of any amount.  The intellectual
property owned by DigiCash consists of a series of patents, protocols, and
software systems that were specifically designed to be privacy protecting
for consumers and which also enable other applications like online
electronic voting.  The ability to pay privately, without revealing personal
information, and avoiding the capture of personal transaction information
for marketing or other subsequent uses is a growing concern among consumers
globally.
