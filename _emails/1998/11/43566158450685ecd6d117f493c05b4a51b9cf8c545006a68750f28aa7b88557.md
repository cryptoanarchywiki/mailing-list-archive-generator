As the World Wide Web Consortium's Platform for Privacy Preferences
Project (P3P) specification is nearing completion, it's time to
start working on P3P implementations.

I have an immediate opening for a java programming contractor to
implement a P3P user agent as a client-side proxy. For details on
P3P see http://www.w3.org/p3p/  This is an excellent opportunity
for a programmer who wants to help make it easier for people to
maintain their privacy online.

An outstanding candidate for this position would have:
- several years of programming experience, including project design 
  experience
- experience with browser plugg-ins, Web proxy servers, or Web clients
  (or at least some familiarity with the HTTP protocol)
- Windows GUI development experience
- user interface design experience
- familiarity with XML

I'm looking for someone who can start ASAP, preferably in the next
month.  This project is expected to last 3 to 6 months, most likely
6 months.  We would prefer someone who can work on site at the AT&T
Labs-Research Shannon Laboratory in Florham Park, NJ, but will
consider outstanding applicants who would prefer to work remotely.
Florham Park is in a nice suburban area less than an hour from
midtown Manhattan.

Please email lorrie@research.att.com for more information or to
apply.
