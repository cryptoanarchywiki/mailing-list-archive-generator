I'm not aware of any law that requires "logging and storage of all
packet info". (I presume you mean 'Wet Computercriminaliteit II' ?)

There is a part that makes ISP liable if they cannot point to a
'user' but the law explicitly states that you have to be in
the business of being an ISP, running a remailer is not my business,
it is a 'not for profit' hobby, so it will be fun to see how "they"
will 'manouvre' to bring that also under the law ...
