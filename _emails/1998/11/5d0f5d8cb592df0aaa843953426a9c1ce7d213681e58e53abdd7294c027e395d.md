_______________________________________

I'm pleased to report that Xcert International and Network Associates Inc.
(NAI) recently announced a technology licensing agreement where NAI will
integrate Xcert's software as the default PKI in their Net Tools Secure
product suite. This relationship will PKI enable NAI's security
offerings-including a suite of best-in-class security applications that
encompasses firewall, intrusion protection, vulnerability scanning,
encryption, authentication, anti-virus and security management. 

NAI is a company with approximately $1 Billion in revenue, 5,000 enterprise
customers, presence on 60 million desktops and 80% plus penetration into
the Global 2000. This is a significant win for Xcert and provides for joint
marketing and sales activities, including licensing of certain NAI
applications to Xcert, pre-notification of NAI product and technology
direction and, most important, the ability for Xcert to work with NAI to
sell general purpose PKI into their installed customer base..  

Xcert was selected over its competitors because of its superior technology,
principally the ability to interoperate with other vendors. NAI's
market-leading Total Network Security solution will seed Xcert's technology
into the market and will also provide NAI's customers with "hooks" to
seamlessly build Xcert's general purpose PKI infrastructure and products
into their networks.

This is a significant win for Xcert. The NAI adoption of Xcert as their
preferred PKI provider adds value to Xcert's brand recognition. This news
is yet another compelling endorsement of Xcert's products. In addition, the
ability to work with NAI's customer base provides substantial opportunity
to Xcert.  

I am sure you will share my enthusiasm for this momentous milestone on
Xcert's road to major market share.

For Immediate Release:

NETWORK ASSOCIATES TO SHIP COMPREHENSIVE PKI FROM XCERT INTERNATIONAL WITH
ALL SECURITY PRODUCT SUITES

Network Associates Customers to Receive Scalable Open-Standards Certificate
Management Integrated Into Net Tools Secure Product Line

SANTA CLARA, Calif., November 17 - Network Associates, Inc. (Nasdaq: NETA)
unveiled the next step in its integrated security strategy today by
announcing a technology partnership with Xcert International that will
bring full open-standards PKI (public key infrastructure) functionality to
all Network Associates customers as a standard feature of its integrated
security product suites. Beginning in the first quarter of 1999, all
integrated security suites from Network Associates will include the new Net
Tools PKI server, an enterprise-scaleable PKI server based on Xcert's
award-winning digital certificate management technology. 

"Network Associates has been very aggressive in driving much needed open
standards and interoperability in the security space," said Sanjay Kalra,
president of Icons, Inc., a leading nationwide PKI consulting firm. "By
working with Xcert to include a complete standards-based PKI in all of
their security application suites at no extra charge, Network Associates is
making things like universal client VPNs and active response firewalls a
reality for customers of all sizes. This announcement is the perfect
follow-up to their previous PKI partnerships with VeriSign and Entrust."

As a result of this partnership, Network Associates customers will be able
to broadly deploy integrated security solutions that interoperate through
secure and authenticated channels. With this announcement, Network
Associates becomes the first vendor to enable secure, scaleable integration
between individual security applications by providing flexible PKI
functionality out of the box and universally supporting existing PKI
solutions like those from partners like VeriSign (Nasdaq: VRSN), Entrust
Technologies (Nasdaq: ENTU) and Xcert.  Network Associates customers will
be licensed to use the new Net Tools PKI with any Network Associates
application. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Network Associates will integrate Xcert's
award-winning PKI technology into its Net Tools Secure product line, a
suite of best-in-class security applications spanning firewall, intrusion
protection, vulnerability scanning, encryption, authentication, anti-virus,
and security management. Xcert's flexible open architecture has received
multiple industry accolades this year, including a recent Editor's Choice
selection from Network Computing that praised Xcert's technology as the
"best strategic choice for PKI in the enterprise." Xcert's technology was
selected by Network Associates because of its broad support of all industry
PKI standards, including x.509, PGP, LDAP, and PKCS #7, 10, and 11.

"Network Associates is committed to promoting broad interoperability and
open standards in the security industry," said Peter Watkins, general
manager of the Net Tools Secure division at Network Associates. "This
agreement makes it even easier for our customers to deploy scaleable,
standards-based, security applications that work together in concert to
actively respond to changing security threats."

"This technology license agreement expands Network Associates'
best-of-breed security offerings to include the industrial-strength PKI
necessary for conducting business-to-business electronic commerce and
communications," said Thomas Nolan, President and CEO of Xcert
International. "Network Associates customers will be able to broadly deploy
distributed security applications, regardless of whether or not they have a
general PKI solution. Because Xcert's technology supports all certificate
standards, Network Associates customers will also be able to interact
seamlessly with business partners who have disparate PKI solutions in use."

While other security application vendors have recently discussed plans to
integrate their products, none have addressed universal PKI support, an
essential element to making integrated security a secure and scaleable
reality for enterprise customers. As a result of this agreement, Network
Associates customers will be able to broadly deploy distributed security
applications such as remote VPN and client-side encryption across large
user populations. The new Net Tools PKI will also support more robust
certificate management for authenticated communications between integrated
Network Associates security applications. Through a concept known as
"Active Security", Network Associates is enabling its security products to
operate in concert, actively communicating events between applications and
adapting security policies of these applications for real-time active
response when critical security threats are detected. 

With headquarters in Santa Clara, California, Network Associates, Inc. is a
leading supplier of enterprise network security and management software.
Network Associates' Net Tools Secure and Net Tools Manager offer
best-of-breed, suite-based network security and management solutions. Net
Tools Secure and Net Tools Manager suites combine to create Net Tools,
which centralizes these point solutions within an easy-to-use integrated
systems management environment. For more information, Network Associates
can be reached at (408) 988-3832 or on the Internet at http://www.nai.com.

Based in Walnut Creek, California, Xcert International Inc. is the premier
developer of Public Key Infrastructure technology. Xcert's products provide
privacy and authenticity for conducting secure Internet business
transactions. Xcert develops, manufactures and distributes Certificate
Authority and public key infrastructure solutions that use secure directory
services to provide organizations and individuals with a ubiquitous and
secure method of communicating with each other over the Internet. Xcert
also licenses its underlying PKI technology to selected service providers
and third party developers worldwide. Xcert can be reached on the World
Wide Web at http://www.xcert.com.
