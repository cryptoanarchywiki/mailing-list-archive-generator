Seems a bit strange that just when the private sector is recognizing
that smart cards are not yet ready for prime time, the Ontario government
is gearing up to launch a "universal smart card" for the delivery of
government services.  But don't worry, the government smart card will
be better than Mondex ... it will have biometric identification.  ;-)
