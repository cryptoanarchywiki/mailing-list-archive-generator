Actually the issue is 1=1*1, 1=1*1*1 ... 1=1^n.  If 1 is prime, then -1 must
be prime since -1=1^n where n is odd and 1=1^n where any n is used.  The fact
that 1 can be factored from itself recursively is the issue.

(If the above weren't true, then -1 could be prime without affecting whether
-3's lack of primality: -3=-1*3 and -3=1*-3.)
