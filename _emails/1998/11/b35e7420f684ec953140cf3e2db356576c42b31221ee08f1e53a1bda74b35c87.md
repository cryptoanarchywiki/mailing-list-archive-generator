And I've something to add. Any person who mentions Iceland as a workable
anarchy is in deep trouble. I done the research and it doesn't fly as a
workable example *unless* you're willing to legalize murder which is
*EXACTLY* what the Icelanders did. It didn't work for them long-term and it
won't work for us either. So if you want to use it you've got to explain why
legalizing murder is a social positive.
