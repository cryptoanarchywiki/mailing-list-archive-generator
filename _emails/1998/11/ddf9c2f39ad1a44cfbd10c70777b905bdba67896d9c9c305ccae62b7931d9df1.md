Amen.  In my experience, no network I've _ever_ been associated with
(private, public, miltary, or whatever) has ever proactively pursued a
security model.  Security has always been defined as preventing a
well-defined (and well-experienced) exploit from being repeatedly used.

Rainbow series, feh!  Even the folks who should know better call NT4 C2
compliant.  CYA is the TLA of the day.
