Perhaps they're not stupid. Perhaps their not nin-compoops, but rather you are
for assigning any value to the entire process.

It is a standard litany of conventional science to choose the lesser of two
evils. Perhaps the lesser of two evils in this corrupted, Constitutionaly
bereft system is *NOT TO PARTICIPATE*. Sine it obviously doesn't matter who
wins, since the mighty spectre of compromise will dilute any real difference
into a verbal shell game devoid of meaning. Maby deToquville (sorry for
spelling - early morning) was right about mediocrity being the result of
democracy, except in one fine point. It won't be the people as a whole but
rather those who are too stupid and wedded to outmoded ideals to change. The
social and political dinosaurs if you will.

Maby the polls where drunk dwarves win over 'serious' candidates is actualy
demonstrating the absurdity of those who insist their issue are serious.
Perhaps people are finaly seeing that these nin-compoops who want the
political power in this country are simply blind to a social and economic
change in the winds.
