The new Strategic Information an Operations Center is unveiled at FBI headquarters
in Washington, D.C. Counterterrorism, computer and violent crime units
have dibs on the center's resources. George Bush cut the ribbon and reporters
were given one last look at tax dollars before they cross over the event
horizon. Subject of this post is a quote from Attorney General Reno at
the unveiling.

Also, a press release from the DOJ (marked "Not For Release"), announcing
a photo op of the Attorney General with Brady "Instant Check" employees
at the FBI Complex at Clarksburg, WVa on thursday, Nov. 19. Photo op was
announced Nov. 18, media responses were required close of business the
same day. National Instant Check System for handgun, rifle and shotgun
sales begins operation on Nov. 30. http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/1998/November/553at.htm

I'm neutral on gun registration but the giant sucking sound from WVa
is bothering my chickens.
