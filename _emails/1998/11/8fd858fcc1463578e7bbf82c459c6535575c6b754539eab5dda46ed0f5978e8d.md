	So leaders should be able to do whatever they want within their own
borders w/out the possibility of being held responsible for what they do to
citizens of other countries who just happen to be visiting?

	What about rule by law?

	So then you admit you were lying about the deaths and blindness
being the cause of regulation, since you claimed it happend in the late
1800's & early  1900's, but the regualtion and taxing went all the way back
to the middle ages?

government into doing something about a problem that doesn't exist.

	It INHERENTLY recognizes it, and inherently limits it.

	No one has the power.

	THAT'S THE POINT.

	Some agendas can't be pushed thru business, or at least not the
same way.

	If I got them legally, they were a legal commodity, if I dispose of
them legally, they move from the "white" market, to the "black" market.

	That was my entire fucking point.

>Now, your point that not everything on the black market is stolen is well
>take as I've said before (you just didn't read it, it at least explains why

	You keep arguing these side points like you don't understand what I
am saying.

	The fact that not everything on the black market was stolen ISN'T
the point, the point is that there can be things on the black market that
aren't stolen, and aren't inherently illegal (tomatoes, vicadan, alcohol)
but are still part of the black market because of the nature of the market
and the legal system.

	FUCKING BULLSHIT. YOu JUST brought introduced your thesis that even
if most stuff isn't actually stolen, then it is bought with money gained by
theft in your last post on this issue. Before that you were maintaining
that everything on the black market had to be stolen, and in fact this
whole side argument occured because you disagreed with me on the fact that
a black market is more defined in terms of the exchange being illegal
rather than the product.

	Tell us Jim, is it a black market if I but a new car, from a
registered dealer, with stolen money? Assuming neither he, nor anyone he
knows, nor anyone I know, excecpt for me, knows the money is stolen?

	My contention all along has been that it isn't about the product,
it's about the trade, the market.

	No it doesn't. It is my contention that in the drug trade, most of
the people buying come by their money thru mechanisms other than theft.
This could be from holding down a Job (as many drug users do),  begging,
prostitution, or other sources than stealing. (there is some SSI diability
fraud there, and I am not denying that theft IS used, just that it's not
the primary method).

	Of the Auto Theft Market. Now find a way to prove what percentage
of that money goes to support the drug trade.

	No, I know a LOT of people who have bought drugs. Not most of the
people who have bought drugs, but a LOT of people.

	Or at worst, but your point is valid.

	Then again, it applies equally to yourself, that there really is no
way of knowing.


>> 	Your question is ignorant and irrelevant, but to answer it: Brokers.
>Oh, you mean fences...

	No Jim, fences purchase a product for <x> (I am given to understand
that %5 <x < %20 of resale value) and resell it. Brokers arrange for
sale/purchacse.

	Think of a Real Estate Broker. They sell your house, but you keep
possesion of it until sold, and have final say on the purchase.

	Yeah, the more I think thru this, joe would either be considered a
"seller", or a "trusted third party.

>

	Produce the text where I said that it is always Ok to shoot someone
with whom you have a diagreement.

	Yeah, and the system protects assholes like OK and the entire Male
side of the kennedy clan (well, John got what was coming to him...)

	What is interesting about that? Just shows that your system doesn't
do shit to stop killings.

	If somebody shows that they have a lack of respect for other
peoples saftey, what do you suggest we do with them?

	Cars are implicated in more deaths every year than occured occured
during any 2 years of the Vietnam war, driving in disregard for the law and
for saftey is like waundering drunk around waving a loaded .357

	What would you suggest be done to someone waundering around drunk
off his ass and pointing a .357 at people?
