Apparently the charges would have been the same if made 
against any 

  "person within the United States, and the results of such 
  use affect interstate or foreign commerce or, in the case 
  of a threat, attempt, or conspiracy, would have affected 
  interstate or foreign commerce." (see below)

The use of E-mail was incidental to the charges of both 
conspiracy and threatening to use weapons of mass destruction:

  18:2332(a)(2) and (c)(2)(C). Conspiracy to use a weapon 
  of mass destruction against person(s) w/in the U.S. 
  the results of which affected interstate & foreign 
  commerce.  Offense dates:  3/24/98 - 6/30/98.  Penalty:  
  Any term of years or for life, $250,000, 5 yrs SRT.  (1)

  18:2332a(a)(2) and (c)(2)(C) and 2.  Threatening to use a
  weapon of mass destruction. Offense date:  6/26/98
  Penalty:  any term of years or Proceedings include all events.
  for life, $250,000, 5 yrs SRT as to ea ct. (2 - 8)

The eight counts are for the one count of conspiracy and
threats against seven federal agencies ("employees and
families"):
