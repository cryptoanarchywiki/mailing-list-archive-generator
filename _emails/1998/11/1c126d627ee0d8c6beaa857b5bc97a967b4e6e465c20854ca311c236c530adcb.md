It's important to read that part about depriving life, liberty, or property
within the context of forced medication, deprivation of social contacts,
etc. before a trial has even been held. A person is innocent until proven
guilty, and that means you can deprive him of geographic freedom if they
can't pay bail. Outside of that any interruption or loss of income is the
responsibility of the state to recompensate. It should also guarantee that if
found innocent the incident won't have an impact on current or future career
and life opportunities. They're sworn to protect life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness with their lives if necessary. That's why their called
PUBLIC SERVANTS.

Note that property may be taken by the state through due process, private
property (my home, personal savings, papers, etc.) can't be siezed for *ANY*
reason without just compensation. Businesses and shared accounts (such as
401k's perhaps) are fair game.

I break the law and you want to take my house?

Fucking get your check book out. Otherwise it's theft and that's a crime in
principle and practice. This means that *EVERY* confiscation law on the
books yesterday, today, or tomorrow are completely illegal if they allow
confiscation of private property in relation to crime.

If the LEA's, courts, politicians, etc. really, really, really believe that
the people of this country want to allow them to confiscate their property
in relation to criminal activity then they should parent an amendment to
that effect immediately. I'll tell you now, it ain't got a hope in hell.
And when the reckoning day comes on this particular issue it's going to be a
doozie.

Note that the right to have *ASSISTANCE* of counsel is guaranteed. This
means the state must provide you an attorney to assist in the correct
process documentation *EVEN* if you represent yourself. Because it uses the
term assistance there can be no implied power of attorney without direct and
unconstrained and willing complicity by the accussed.
