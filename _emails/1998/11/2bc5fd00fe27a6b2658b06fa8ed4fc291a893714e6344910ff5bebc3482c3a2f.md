I'm not, taxes are a political transaction, I must pay them whether or not I
demand the service or disservice I receive for them -- taxes are not bound
by supply and demand.

It is the defining excuse for the FEDERAL government to interfere with the
economic system.

Try studying the free banking era of the Mid 1800's, or the international
exchange markets.

Why can't you trade your Texas money? Who is to prevent you? Who is to
prevent other from meeting the exchange demand? Who it so prevent people
from accepting it in trade? Clearly with the digitization of money, multiple
currencies are not a problem.

I'm not, the gun is the defining characteristic that makes it political and
not economic.

Self-destructed command economy that created prices by fiat instead of
obeying market economics.

>

Self-destructed empire (starting with our war of independence) by creating
artificial trade barriers between the colonies to reap artificial profits at
the colonies expense (which was really at the heart of the revolution, not
taxation nor representation).

> Economics *is* human behaviour

Let's expand the definition to the point it has no meaning. No thank you.
Economics is production and trade; human behavior affects trade, it is not
economics.

You can predict the actions of groups of individuals if you understand the
nature of individuals. Predicting an individual is left to the soothsayers.

Okay, you take your laws of greed/want/desire and figure out how to sustain
life.

No, self-sufficiency by its definition means you are...well...sufficient by
yourself. If you require trade, you are no longer self-sufficient.

> symbol is money.

Money either has intrinsic value, or it is a symbol and debt against
something held of value, or it is a debt on the future acquisition of value
produced by someone else -- i.e. future productivity.

Oh, please do tell when/where this popular vote took place.

We've moved from intrinsic value currency to a currency representing hard
value (gold) to something that represents nothing more than faith of
government, and whose supply is controlled by fiat of a *private*
institution -- the Federal Reserve Board.

Discretion by you of the disclosure by you of information about you. Make
sense?

The other type of privacy, somehow preventing other people from disclosing
information about you by means other than mutual agreement is privacy of the
statist type.

No cost, eh? I suggest you take a look at the congressional allocations for
FBI wiretapping capabilities.

> No, regulation does not automaticaly imply force.

Correct -- in fact the only regulations by private individuals/entities that
*do* have force behind them is that of the custodian/dependent relationship,
and they are limited. But find a government regulation that does not have
the confiscation of your property (by force) and/or incarceration of your
person (by force) as the absolute finality to non-compliance. They are few.

Oh, I forgot if you agree it irrelevant because you are simply being
entirely combative.

But you are not the initiator, you are reacting to my initiation of a force
(or derivative), in this case trespass and theft.

No, force in reaction to force. That is plainly simple.

Brain fart, the 2nd. The right to bears arms has historically implied the
right to bear arms in defense against a despot.
