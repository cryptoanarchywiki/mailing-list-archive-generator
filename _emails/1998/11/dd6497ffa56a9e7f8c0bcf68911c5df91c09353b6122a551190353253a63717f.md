I'm currently serving a 3-year term on the Board of Trustees of the
Internet Society, and have volunteered for the nominations committee.
The board is elected by the membership; every year five or six
Trustees are elected to three-year staggered terms.  I would like to
see talented people who care about the future of society serve on the
board.  I know there are many such among the cypherpunks.  If you are
willing to serve on the Board, please nominate yourself, or if you
know someone who's willing to serve and who you think would be good,
please nominate them.  Send such nominations to isoc-noms@isoc.org.
The message below gives all the details.

Not everyone nominated will be on the ballot; the nominations
committee will winnow it to a list of ten or fifteen people.  And
among those people, only the top five vote-getters will be elected by
the membership.

Anyone who the nominations committee doesn't pick for the ballot, can
get on it anyway, if they submit a petition from 65 Internet Society
members to put their name on the ballot.  That's how I got on the
ballot when I was elected a few years ago.  (IETF is a great place to
run around and get people to sign your petition.)

Being a Trustee makes you responsible for the acts of the Internet
Society.  And you get to help decide what those acts will be.  It's an
unpaid, volunteer job.  You get to fly (at your own expense) to the
board meetings a few times a year.  ISOC has done many good things,
like training people in a hundred countries how to set up the first
Internet node there.  Like publicly stating (in RFC 1984) that it will
ignore US export controls when designing worldwide Internet crypto
protocols.  Like working hard to resolve the mess around domain-name
and IP-address administration, and the mess around the "Internet"
trademark.  ISOC also provides the organizational structure for the
IETF and the Internet Architecture Board.  ISOC will probably do many
more good things -- particularly if it has good people as Trustees!

Whether or not you want to be a Trustee, I encourage you to join the
Internet Society as a member -- see http://www.isoc.org/isoc/membership/

Attention: 1999 Nominations Committee

are to include the name of the nominated individual, contact details and a
brief explanation of the basis of the nomination.

The  committee will confirm with the candidates their willingness to stand
for election as a nominated candidate if so selected. Nominees will also be
requested to provide the committee with further personal details (in the
format of a curriculum vita) as they relate to the selection guidelines
that are to be applied by the committee, and provide to the committee a
statement indicating their willingness and ability to devote an appropriate
level of time to activities associated with the position of Trustee of the

It is intended that the committee's selection process will result in 10
candidates for election as nominated candidates.  This list will  be passed
to the Elections Committee on 19 December 1998, as well as informing voting
members of the Society of the selected nominees.

Additional candidates for election to the Board of Trustees may be
nominated by membership petition, filed with the Chair of the
Nominating Committee no later than 22 January 1999.  A petition for
the 1999 election will require the signatures of sixty-five voting
ISOC members (1% of the total voting members). Specific details of the
petition process will be included in the announcement of nominated
candidates on 19 December 1998.

Following the closure of the petition period, the list of the nominated and
petitioned candidates will be announced 29 January 1999.

The Election Committee will mail the ballots out to ISOC voting members on
26 February 1999 and the election date is set to be 3 May 1999.

B. Nominations Committee Selection Guidelines

Candidates for ISOC Trustee should have a demonstrable involvement in the
Internet. Such involvement may range from  participation as a technology
developer, researcher, user, network operator, policy maker (e.g. in
government), sponsor of research and development. ISOC is interested in
broadly-based representation on the Board of Trustees and seeks to identify
candidates from industry, education and non-profit sectors and from
government. The selection criteria will be directed to selecting a broad
range of interests, and will include criteria of regional location, current
activities, relevant experience and professional background.

Ten candidates will be selected by this committee, using the criteria as
outlined above.
