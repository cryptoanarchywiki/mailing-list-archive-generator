   WORLD'S BIGGEST DISK DRIVE

     To mark the centenary of magnetic recording, IBM today unveiled the
largest (25gb) hard drive yet produced for PCs. It's shipping limited
numbers to PC makers for use in machines that will be ready for Christmas.
IBM introduced the first disk drive, back in 1956. It had a capacity of 5mb
and was the size of two large refrigerators. The new 25gb drive comes on
the 100th anniversary of the Telegraphone, a primitive answering machine.
