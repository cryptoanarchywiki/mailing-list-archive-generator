I thought I was following along until I got here, and got very lost. First
question: I think the first sentence implies 4 is prime, so I must have
the emphasis wrong.

Unless you are saying that you cannot factor 4 as 2*2 because < of
something I missed >. So the only factorization of 4 is 4*1, hence 
four is prime. 

The other explanation is "Whoosh" the whole conversation when over
my head and I'm lost.
