Mr. Clinton would seem to have a problem with the concept
of "covert" as it applies to personal and international actions.

The MIB who visited the radio astronomer who thought he discovered
extraterrestrial "intelligence", when it was just a classified intelligence
satellite, have a "subtlety" problem.
