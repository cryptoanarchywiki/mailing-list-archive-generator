It's protected by Microsoft asserting that it's protected.  There's also some
sort of attempt at encryption (easily broken, see
http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/breakms.txt), but in any case there are
enough security holes there that anything which manages to run on your system
(ActiveX, as you've mentioned) can grab your keys without a lot of trouble.
