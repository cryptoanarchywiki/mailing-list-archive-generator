>
>[News.com] (11.8.98) Wang Global has introduced a new portable computer,
>but it's not going to be winning any svelteness contests. 
> 
>Wang's Tempest Mobile Workstation, 3 inches thick and weighting 14.5
>pounds, is designed for government officials who need spy-proof computers
>that don't leak any telltale signals to electronic eavesdroppers. 
>
>The boxes are designed to meet the U.S. government's "Tempest"
>specification, which requires a computer to release extremely low amounts
>of electromagnetic emissions that could reveal what information the
>computer is processing. 
> 
>To protect against such emissions, Tempest-compliant machines must be
>encased in a lot of metal. Wang's portable looks like a thick laptop, said
>Wang spokeswoman Loretta Day, "but it's really so heavy, you can't really
>call it a laptop"  --all that metal would make it quite a burden for your
>lap. 
>
>As an added bonus, all that metal shields the computer from the
>electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generated by an exploding nuclear bomb that
>wreaks havoc with anything electronic. 
>
>When it's running, the machine can withstand a shock of five Gs--that's
>five times the acceleration caused by the Earth's gravity. But when it's
>switched off, it can take a 60-G shock. 
>
>Aside from being spy-proof, the new Wang system has some features that are
>familiar to ordinary buyers: a 15.1-inch LCD screen, a 233-MHz or 266-MHz
>Pentium II processor, a CD-ROM drive, and your choice of a 4GB, 6GB, or
>8GB removable hard disk. 
> 
>Wang also makes Tempest-compliant desktop computers, printers, routers,
>switches, and servers. It's one of a handful of such companies that supply
>the equipment to the government. Day said the chief customers are the
>State Department and intelligence agencies. Wang also makes computer
>equipment that complies with the Zone standard, similar to but less
>stringent than the Tempest standard. 
> 
>Pricing on the Wang portable wasn't available, but a competitor's Tempest
>portable computer with more lesser features was listed at one government
>Web site as costing more than $10,000.
