True enough.  Groups that produce software that play a critical role in 
security almost always sign the binaries.

Break into the coding environment?  Does that mean they broke into
the VMS development shop?

Already proven.  The emergent behavior of the Linux development model
does not need centralized process to coordinate it.  People who had
access to the source and were aware of the teardrop attack hacked a
patch to it almost immediately.  The patch was widely available the
next day.  How long did it take for microsoft?
