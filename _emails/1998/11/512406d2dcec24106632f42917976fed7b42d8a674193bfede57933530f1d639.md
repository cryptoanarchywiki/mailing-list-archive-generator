This is not at all clear.

If Alice has information about Bob, and the cops seek information from
Alice about Bob, and Alice provides it, Bob cannot generally (as I
understand constitutional law) claim any violation of his Fourth Amendment
protections against unlawful search and seizure.

Now maybe Alice can, if they are her records. (As this transfers the
"papers" she is "secure in" to her.) But not if she gives them up
voluntarily or is subject to other regulations.

Specifically, if the Alice Bank, subject to banking regs and suchlike,
gives up information on Bob the Customer, no Fourth A. issues are likely
involved.

(There may  be contractual issues, if Alice has promised Bob that she won't
give up Bob's secrets, and so on.)

I'm not approving of the Feds examining the records of banks, only noting
that the Fourth is not implicated here. From what I know of the law.

(Legal beagles would probably mutter about a penumbra of the Fourth, an
expectation of privacy, etc.)
