Duncan Campbell says he doubts the Paul Dore
story has anything to do with P415/Echelon, which
is a collection system not a satellite. Moreover, the
description of a "deep space" satellite does not fit
the the known parameters of those that gather 
intelligence. Might be a completely new type but that's
a stretch.

One article Anonymous posted says Paul Dore denies 
having anything to do with the Web page we cited here 
as having been removed.

Another says the SETI people are pissed about the incident, 
one saying it has set SETI's credibility back "by a 100 years."

Still unexplained is the reason for the now 11,000 downloads
of Duncan's 1988 article on P451/Echelon in the last 36 hours. 
Could be an alien bot, pissed at being awakened by SETI 
putzes' screen savers.
