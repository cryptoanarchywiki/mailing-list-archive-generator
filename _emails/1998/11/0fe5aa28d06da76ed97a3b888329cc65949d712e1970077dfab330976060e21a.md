Long list of problems which could result from someone using your SSN snipped...

So much for the SSN "never" becoming a national ID number! 

Since your SS account and pension can be negatively impacted, this tends to reinforce the idea that your SSN should be a secret. But how can we keep it a secret if they keep putting it on public documents such as drivers licenses? Seems to me that when they are all done making the SSN the official National ID number they will need to give us a NEW SSN that is secret, kind of like a PIN to unlock and validate our National ID and SS accounts. 

...and latter a PIN to protect the PIN...
