It was a reply to your statement. If you don't want people to ask questions
or draw conclusions from your statements then perhaps you should rething
even making those statements. As to sarcasm, there was none in my original
posting.

No, I expressed an opinion as to your motivation. Opinions never insult
except when presented as fact. I did not do that.

Me still thinks yo protest too much.
