>    There's a problem that could very badly effect the public perception
>    of Linux and Open Source. I want people to think about this, and
>    hopefully "head it off at the pass" before it happens.
>    
>    Perhaps it's already on your system today: a trojan-horse program. It
>    might be a game, or more likely a system utility. It's author uploaded
>    it to an FTP archive, where it was then picked up by your favorite
>    Linux distribution, who wrote it onto the CD-ROM that you bought. It
>    works just fine, but hidden away in the program is a special feature:
>    a secret back-door past your system's security.
>    
>    Perhaps the author of this attack is tired of hearing about what great
>    hackers we are, and wants to take us down a notch. He's patient - he
>    will wait until his program is distributed to tens of thousands of
>    Linux systems before he says a word. But say is what he'll do - he's
>    not really interested in breaking into your system. What he wants is
>    the publicity, bad publicity for us, and lots of it. We've left the
>    gates open for this trojan horse. Let's talk about how to close them,
>    and hope we have enough time to solve this problem before our
>    reputation is hurt.
