You can't both ignore and subvert. One is passive the other is active. Now
if your thesis holds that this is a commen sentiment then you're in big
trouble finding mass support (which is what your theory would require to be
valid). I would say the vast majority of people don't share your views.

The technology is certainly unprecedented, I doubt there has been a single
new human emotion or perspective developed because of it; only new venues
for the same old human failings and foibles. Or by sentiment do you mean your
view of nihilism? If so I would suggest you study nihilism closer.

> The thesis that to ignore the nation-state will see it's demise?

Historicaly strategies reducable to a ostrich_with_its_head_in_the_sand have
not worked well in changing peoples minds nor motivating them to action, let
alone causing the demise of a nation state. This isn't surprising if you
consider the types of personalities that lead people.

I'll disagree regarding free-market economies. As to throwing in the towel,
we agree there.
