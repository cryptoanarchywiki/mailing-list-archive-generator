Yo, Bernie - until you started asking for pirated commercial software,
I was wondering whether you were trolling by asking newbie questions
or just a real newbie who hadn't looked at any of the literature yet.  
Knapsacks are, after all, broken long ago, and anything written 
since about 1980 that talks about them will also say that.

I'd recommend getting Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography"
and spending a while with it, then looking for academic stuff
beyond that if you want, and also reading the documentation for PGP
for practical stuff (in particular, Phil's comments on Snake Oil.)
There are also some FAQs out there, such as the sci.crypt FAQ.
				Thanks!
