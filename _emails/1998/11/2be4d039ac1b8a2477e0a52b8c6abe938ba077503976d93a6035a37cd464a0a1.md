So, you want to sub-contract out which is going to raise the cost and
doesn't alleviate the insurance company from regulatory and supply issues.
It'd cost a fortune.

I'd love to see your cost breakdown...

Yep, and a lot of people the competition would eliminate as well. I'll live
with the inefficiency as long as the cost is affordable for the quality of
service delivered. I don't mind fireman sitting around eating bar-b-q unless
somebodies house burns down.

That is one example, I know of several fortune 100 companies that are equaly
extravagant. The problem with Compu-Add was they shot their whole wad.

Sure there is, it just takes longer than a rifle bullet to settle.

Not at all, they are limited in what they can do by the laws. It's not like
they're running around sending bills to people out of the blue and making up
the system as they go along. Despite your protestations to the contrary the
system just don't work that way.

If it happened to you and you didn't file a harrassment complaint then you
got what you deserved. If you don't use the system it won't work.

Never happened to me or anyone I knew unless they were in particular places
at particular times. If a cop busts people at a corner every nite for
breaking the law it isn't the cops fault, it's the stupid people who keep
doing the same damn thing at the same place knowing full well the consequences.

Nobody said it was and it isn't. Now if you happen to fit the description of
another perp well that's just too damn bad.

Oh, malarky (and stay away from my business books). It's obvious you never
do accounting. The matching funds are for roads outside of the city or for
highways that transit cities. They are not supposed to be used for city
street or FM or RM roads.

> 	Then why do they keep building them?

Because we still hav an Army whose job it is to defend this country you
nit-wit. If we didn't keep fixing them and expanding the system as people
move around and expand the Army might find it a tad hard to do their job
when called to it. And yes, I know the Militia is the one who is supposed
to be called in for that sort of stuff - that's a whole other topic.

Absolutely. While I agree that there are some particular issues that need
fixing in a major way that is not the same (as you would have us believe) as
saying as a result the whole system should be scrapped.

Oh, you mean insanity, egotism, neurosis, etc.?

Ah, but it does try and in some cases it succeeds. So my expectation is not
completely without merit.

No, *all* people are not such. Most people I know are honest and have
integrity. What has to happen is a set of checks and balances, which we are
admittedly short of at the moment. The system isn't perfect, never claimed
to be (read the 1st paragraph if the Constitution), and if it remains so
then it's *OUR* fault and not the systems.

You claim to be honest yet promote a system that allows slavery, murder,
theft, and other horrendous crimes against man....
