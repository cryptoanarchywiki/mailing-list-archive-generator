Yes. There are the issues of human psychology which requires stable social
institutions, there is the question of economic fragility if the market is
too fragile or volatile. There is the question of long-term ownership of
property and services. It's hard to run a business if you don't know what
the rules will most likely be in a year or 10.

There are lots of reasons that social and political institutions should be
long-lived.
