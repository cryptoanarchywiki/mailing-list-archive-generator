	You are one confused puppy. You are saying that it would be wrong
for nations to get involved, because it isn't any of their business, but it
is ok, and in fact proper for PEOPLE to get involved.

	What are nations? People. People acting in agregate. If a the
people have a right, or a responsibility to act, then they have the right
to request that their nation act as their proxy (which after all is what
nations are allegdely for according to your theory of government) in
resolving their problem.

	I disagree. If we find that their country is gassing people, we
have a responsibility to intervene. My problem with our actions is that it
is not done on the principle of preventing the genocide of a people, but on
the principle that we need instability in the Middle East to keep cheap oil
for us.

	Whatever you can do to what end. to continue to support a state of
affairs that does nothing but lead in a circle? To continue to support the
murder of a people (the kurds) and the threat of the release of Biological
and Chemical toxins in Isreal (which probably diserves to get the shit
kicked out of it a time or two for it's arrogance and it's facist ways, but
NBC warfare is rather rude and nasty).

	The use of lead pipes was because we didn't know better until then.
Time and education would have solved that problem as well as any law. Most
business (especially smaller local type businesses) don't want their
customers falling down dead, it tends to decrease business.

	Ever seen a newpaper in production? They are run on things called
"presses", and for many years (1600's, 1700's and 1800's, until the wide
spread adpotion of radio) they were the primary (only) source of news. That
is probably where the name "The Press" comes from, and why the first
amendment attempts to claim freedom for it.

	While one can point to isolated incidences of that happening, the
most honest accusation one can point at the press is that they tend to
report what is happening in a way that will sell newspapers rather than
slant stories to avoid pissing off potential advertisers. There are simply
too many advertisers to worry about.

	They might kill the occasional story, but in a competitive market,
of the opposition believes that there is a market for the story, it'll get
told.

>Jefferson said he would never write a line in a newspaper, and didn't. He

	I'd imagine he held certain types of Newspapers in low regard,
probably the 1700's version of Weekly World News.

	There just wasn't a whole lot else being printed back then.

	These days just set up a web site. Other than that, it's fairly
easy technically to start a "press", you just get something you want
printed typeset (or do it yourself) and pay a press to print it.

	That is no excuse.

>> 	Yeah, and there are laws against Drug Dealing which work real well.

	Yeah, laws don't work real good.

	It specificly doesn't do that. For every person that says "I'd try
pot if it were legal", there are 10 who smoke it, and 20 more who've tried
it.

	So the law DIDN'T stop you, you already admit you wouldn't have
been caught, and in at least one instance you probably SHOULD have capped
the person, for the good of soceity, yet you didn't.

	Why? Because ingrained in all of us (even Mr. May) is the idea that
it is wrong to kill other humans wantonly. At times our baser instincts
override this conditioning, and there are a few whom it never takes on, and
some people can override it at will, but it's still there.

	It'll still be there when the laws are dust.

	It wouldn't take a large population, since there is no societal
pressure preventing private retribution.

	Try it. Organize it and see what happens. If it looked at all like
you had a chance in hell of actually getting one together, you'd be
receiveing photographs of you with a cute little mexican boy in the most
*intersting* positions imaginable.

	He (allegedly) donates large amounts of money to Gun Control, and
well, he has created a LOT of jobs, and maybe some of them donate the money.

	Putting a gun to his head an forcing him to be charitable is still
stealing.

	Because they are better than him? (I don't buy this)

	The wealthy give more to charity every year than most people make.
I used to work for a woman who thought NOTHING of writing a 10,000 check to
certain charities. She wasn't paying ME that much in a year.

	Never claimed it would be utopia, in fact I never claimed it would
be better for most people than now, I just claim freer. I believe that to
be a better way.

>I gotta stop now, I'm sleepy.

	Yeah. I know that feeling.
