It wasn't me, I said it was axiomaticaly contradictory.

A oxymoron is two terms with contradictory meaning used together (eg
deafening silence).

  You know, that we can't have a society

Than anarchy is sooooo screwed.

  The state is nothing but an organization which kills

That's your rather self-serving definition. A state, used as a synonym for
government, has a much broader group of responsiblities.

  By

Demostrate please. I have not said, nor said anything that implies that. I
have said that people have a right to self defence and as an extension the
need of armies and other such institutions are an extension of that. I also
believe that police should exist and should have the responsibility to use
deadly force, just not in as many instances as now.

Anarchist would leave it to the individual to decide, a bad precidence.

> *We* weren't the ones who raised that strawman. ;)

No, *YOU* are exactly the ones who raised it.
