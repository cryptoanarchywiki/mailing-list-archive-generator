In order to relieve the CDR list of some of the flood of "You have
successfully registered" messages, and because some people feel there
is a need for such a thing, I have created a new mailing list for the
specific purpose of being used for registering for online services,
reg@minder.net.  Subject lines of mail from the list with be prepended
with "[r]" for easy filtering, whether automated or by eye.





It is a majordomo list, so those who are familiar with majordomo can
subscribe in the usual fashion.  For those who are not familar with
majordomo, to subscribe send a message to "majordomo@minder.net" with
"subscribe reg" (without the quotes) in the body of the message.  

Cheers,

-Brian
