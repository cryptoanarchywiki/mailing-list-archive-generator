So what are saying...that because any government ever happened to abuse its
citizens in a particular way is justification to do away with all
government?

This is a strawman.

Well actualy it's whether it has a tax stamp whether you sell it out of a
storefront or a truckbed is irrelevent. Considering the number of people who
died in the late 1800's and early 1900's because of moonshine liquor from
contaminated stills that were unregulated (where were those fine upstanding
ethical considerate eco-anarchists then?) it's probably a good thing that
it's illegal to sell untaxed and therefore anonymous alcohol.

Not necessarily. The doctor has to have a medicaly supportable reason to
dispence those drugs. Otherwise it's just as black market as Joe's.

So, we've already established this as a viable mechanism. Rehash old hash.

Didn't think of theft? Jesus H. Christ, you gotta be on Joe's drugs. The
vast majority of material sold on *ANY* black market is stolen from its
rightful owner. It is *the* example of black market trading that most folks
think of first.

Well, at least you're an honest eco-anarchist. And how do you propose to stop
this sort of behaviour (it's clear that there is a market whether the
economy is free-market or not) without some sort of 3rd party arbiter (call
it government or not is irrelevant to the point)?

How the hell do you sell something on the black market if you don't have
possession of it? And exactly who is going to prosecute anyone for
possession? Since we've done away with laws governing economics and trade
there isn't even a court to try the perps in if we did apprehend them
ourselves.

Huh? Who is doing all this arresting and writing of laws, and building
jails, and staffing prisons, or hiring hangmen?

We're not in Kansas anymore toto....
