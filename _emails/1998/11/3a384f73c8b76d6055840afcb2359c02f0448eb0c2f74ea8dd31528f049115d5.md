No, and exactly how you managed to derive that is truly humorous.

Until somebody either squeels (not likely since they're dead shortly
afterward or let loose and nobody will hire then from then on, not
in the business' best interest.) or they do get caught and a connection is
made (not very likely since the perp won't be carryin an employee badge).
And since company A is the company that will be prosecuting (their own
under-the-table employee) the consequences are pretty predictible.

How commen is it now for business' to partake in illegal activities in order
to further their business ends? How often do you suppose, given that rate,
they are caught? I'd say not a lot. I see no reason to suspect that in a
anarcho-whatever society that rate will be one whit better.

Oh, they'll get caught occassionaly but then again, the strategy of forcing
company B to keep investigators on call and monitoring their customers
property is a good strategy to raise their cost of doing business and as
a result their coverage rates. This increase will help convince user of
B's service that A looks like a better bang for the buck.

Sure it would, it decreases the cost of doing business and increases
the potential market for future consumers of the services. It happens all
the time now, it won't go away.

Because their funds and income is from a known source. Ask yourself this,
what happens if a police officer or a fire inspector suddenly starts driving
a Porche around and moving out into the uppity neighborhoods and doesn't
have a good explanation for it?

Apparently I've strained your short-term memory here, go back and read
it again. Which insurance company is obvious - all of them.

I'm done now, this isn't about anarcho-anything, this is about you getting
your jollies off trying to take cheap shots at me personaly.

Whoopie.
