Ex-CIA head John Deutch and two NatSecs write in November
Foreign Affairs on "Catastrophic Terrorism: Tackling the New
Danger:"

   http://jya.com/ct-tnd.htm  (36K)

They propose three new orgs to prevent and respond to terrorist
use of WMD on a large scale:

1. National Terrorism Intelligence Center (Mil/Intel/LEA)
2. National Information Assurance Institute (Gov/Corp/Tank)
3. Catastrophic Terrorism Response Offices (Intel/Plan/Train/Task/Direct)

Paralleling Senator Kyl and others, the proposals are based
on the increased domestic use of the military while proclaiming
civil liberties will be protected. And though there is considerable
detail about how the military, intelligence agencies and
law enforcement will work together - US and foreign - and the
vast purchases of sevices and equipment that will be needed, 
there's next to nothing about how civil liberties will be protected.

Reference is made to America's marshalling its patriotism and 
technology to win the Cold War, and the wondrous inventions
developed to do that. Again, though, no mention is made of the
price of military industrialism, which is to be expected of our
finest catastrophe-obessessed minds unable to imagine a world 
without endless national security threats to grow their pork.
