John,

NEW is such a goddamned brilliant acronym.

Now I'll get in trouble if I start making *major cojones capacitors*.
Mineral oil will become a controlled substance if possessed in
quantities greater than 1/2 pt or used in any manner other than that
described on the label. Vacuum pumps will be contraband. Like ROM
burners.

I can't help but think that these guys are just looking for a new "main

Yet another infrastructure system getting ready for the hackers. Won't
even be able to trust traffic lights soon. Yet another excuse for
insurance rate changes.

I guess I'd prefer automation with fewer features but better reliability
and security to soldiers in the streets. No luck there though, too
practical, it would be too inexpensive and what would we do with all
those soldiers?
