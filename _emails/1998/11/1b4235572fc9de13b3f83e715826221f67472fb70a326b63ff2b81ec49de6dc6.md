dear Mr. Lasica:
your article is mostly fair and accurate but fails to 
delve into some obvious and basic issues.

1st, check out david brin's recent book on privacy.. you
cover only a tiny facet of the issues, of people that
argue privacy should be protected. consider a very interesting
alternative view..

2nd: it is easy to take any digital image of a naked woman
and paste the head of any other person on top of it, to the
point that it is indistiguishable from a real picture. tell
this to the mother of the daughter who's naked pictures were
posted.

3rd: you fail to mention anonymity/pseudonymity, the starkly obvious
solution to all the pseudo-problems you raise. your article
is fairly mild but reflects the constant refrain of journalists
to phrase every news story as some kind of looming or
scary crisis.

the issues you speak of have been debated among cpunks for
years with more insight. not expecting you to know abut cpunks,
but you coulda done a teeny better on that article.

a decent article nonetheless on important issues..

please purchase a few clues from the nearest cpunks and
try,try again.

take care
