Standard interoperation of different protocols.  We do it all the time.

Who cares what they do as long as they leave me alone.

He was not an anarchist.

If voluntary interaction doesn't work as a social system then we're all in
big trouble because persons (you?) who love to command others will have a
hard time doing so as everyone becomes rich, mobile, and technologically
powerful.  If you have figured out a way to push around rich, mobile, and
technologically powerful people you're a smarter man than I am.  I'm sure
the Feds could use your unique insights.

BTW we live in a representative republic not a democracy and the theory was
that it was to be a representative republic of strictly limited powers.
Our representatives have forgotten.  Technology and market institutions are
teaching them different.
