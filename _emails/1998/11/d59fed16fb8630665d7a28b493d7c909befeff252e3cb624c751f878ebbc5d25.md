All good points, but there's a big difference between trying to meet FCC
emissions requirements for a commercial product that has to meet cost,
weight, and cosmetic requirements (e.g., a plastic case!), and the scenario
of making a TEMPEST-like box for a laptop. Ferrite beads and copper tape
are a lot different from a sealed box made of 10-gauge copper sheet.

Sure, but my point was that John Young should *at least* start with actual
measurements, as opposed to putting most of the onus on a FOIA request to
get TEMPEST docs declassified.

If he can get spectrum analyzers and all that stuff, so much the better.
