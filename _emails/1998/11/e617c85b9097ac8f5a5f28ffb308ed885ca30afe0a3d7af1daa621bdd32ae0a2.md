This little phone looks nice with one gotcha: they left out encryption. 
Did they do this just to sell internationally and avoid the privacy
issue altogether?

Considering how the product is constructed, adding encryption would not
be a major step.

Not all companies are complaining about CALEA.

Aplio [ http://www.aplio.com/ ] CEO Olivier Zitoun believes his
company's
products fall into the FCC's definition of computer-to-computer IP
telephony. Aplio sells boxes that can be plugged into normal touch-tone
phones and used to call an Internet provider, which routes calls over
the
Net.

"We are very different than other phone-to-phone devices or solutions,"
Zitoun said. "In a way, the discussion of IP-telephony regulation
doesn't
really apply to us."
