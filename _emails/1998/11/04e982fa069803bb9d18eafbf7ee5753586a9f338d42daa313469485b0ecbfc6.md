Sorry, I won't do this.

Anyone who wants to start a discussion on a mailing list SHOULD BE ON THAT
MAILING LIST!

I have no animosity toward Jean-Francois Avon, but it seems to me he has a
couple of times subscribed, unsubscribed, posted blind to the list, posted
Canadian gun issues to the list, said he doesn't read the Cypherpunks list
anymore, etc.

Jeesh.

I know it's de rigeur to trash the CP list these days, as in "I no longer
have time to wade through the trash on the Cypherpunks list,"  but people
who don't have time to read the list should not then post to it.

Jeesh.
