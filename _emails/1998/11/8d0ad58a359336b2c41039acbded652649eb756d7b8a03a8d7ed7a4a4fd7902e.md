	Nearly all laptops have a built-in video port, for connection
	to an external monitor. This is often poorly shielded (usually
	just a plastic plug). I'd be curious to know how much the
	radiation from this port could be attenuated by (1) a metal
	plug contacting the laptop's ground plane, and (2) removing
	all the video-port specific circuitry (major surgery for a
	laptop :-( ).
