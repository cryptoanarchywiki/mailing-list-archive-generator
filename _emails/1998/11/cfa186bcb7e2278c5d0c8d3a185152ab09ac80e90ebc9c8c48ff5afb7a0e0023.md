Andrew Hagen writes
"Network Associates, formerly McAfee, developer of PGP, has quietly rejoined
the Key Recovery Alliance. Despite withdrawing from the group last December
amid pointed concerns over the continued trustworthiness of PGP, NAI
apparently rejoined the Key Recovery Alliance (KRA) three months later with
their February 1998 acquisition of Trusted Information Systems, a founding
member of the KRA. The KRA's major stated goal is creation of "a global
infrastructure that supports recovery of encrypted information." NAI has
sent me e-mail stating that they might or might not remain in the KRA, that
"PGP products will not be affected," and that they have "no interest in
enabling key escrow for government access." Network Associates is presently
listed on the KRA membership roster."
