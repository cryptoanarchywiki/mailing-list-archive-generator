>    NEW YORK (AP) -- A New York City strip club has found a loophole that
>    allows it to wriggle past the mayor's crackdown on sex-oriented
>    businesses.
>    
>    The club says its policy is to admit kids -- if they're accompanied by
>    adults.
>    
>    Therefore, it argues, it's not an adult business.
>    
>    A judge agrees.
>    
>    Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is livid.
