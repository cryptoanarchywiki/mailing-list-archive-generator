The NSA Scientific Advisory Board has been functioning
since 1953:

   http://jya.com/nsa-sab97.htm

The 1997 annual report briefly describes what it does and what it 
costs to do it. However, its closed meetings are not announced in 
the Federal Register as required by regulations governing such 
FACA orgs. Names of members, minutes and studies are not 
available. 

We've made a request for info to the NSA office which handles 
the matter (301) 688-6449. 

Any information on the board would be welcome. 

Skimpy annual reports on the NSA SAB, like the one for 1997
above, as well as for all other federal advisory committees, from 
1972 to 1997 are available at:

   http://policyworks.gov/org/main/mc/index-r.htm
