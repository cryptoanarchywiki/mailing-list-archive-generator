	Theft, violence and extortion are already legitimate, not only does
the government use them all the time, but corporations and indivuduals do
as well.

	There is no (or little) justice under the current system. When was
the last time a cop went to jail for a murder that he/she committed while
on duty. Is OJ behind bars?

	We have courts of Law, Justice is ashamed to show her face.

	We recognize that these interactions exist, but guess what, for any
sort  of anarchy to exist, it has to happen globally. We are as concerned
about the people on the other side of the planet as we are about the people
in the next city over. Just not much.

>They make the same mistake as every other form of non-democratic system,

	No, we assume the opposite, that nothing works for large numbers of
people, and everyone should be free to find their own level.

	Riiiighhht. Tell that to Californians who decided that Marjuana
should be part of Doctors tool kit, and the Feds said "prescribe it and
loose your lisence to prescribe".

	He was just taking into account different cultural differences.
Some cultures don't have a problem with slavery.

	Personally, given a lack of law enforcement, I'd shoot the
bastards, but then I never claimed to be tolerant of other peoples
cultures.

"To sum up: The entire structure of antitrust statutes in this country is a
jumble of economic irrationality and ignorance. It is a product: (a) of a
gross misinterpretation of history, and (b) of rather nave, and certainly
unrealistic, economic theories." Alan Greenspan, "Anti-trust"
