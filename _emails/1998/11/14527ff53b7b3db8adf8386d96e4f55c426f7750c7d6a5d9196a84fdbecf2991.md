I could be wrong, but I thought Goldbach's conjecture was that every even
number could be expressed as the sum of *two* primes. This doesn't prohibit
repetition. Therefore, under Goldbach's conjecture:

4 -> 2 + 2
6 -> 3 + 3 but NOT 2 + 2 + 2
8 -> 5 + 3 but NOT 2 + 2 + 2
etc...

But I am a lowly freshman, so what do I know...

If we go with the flow and exclude 1 (so we don't have to rewrite all our
theorems) and assume that all even numbers greater than 2 can be represented
as a sum of two prime factors we have a problem...

How does one sum 4?

2 + 2?

We certainly can't use 3 + 1. If we allow repetition *and* the number 2 as a
prime then all even numbers can be written as a string of 2's summed
appropriately.
