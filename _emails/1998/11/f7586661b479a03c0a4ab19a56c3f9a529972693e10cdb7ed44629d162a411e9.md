Well, maybe, maybe not.  It depends.  No use of becoming a martyr if nobody 
cares...  Blowing a SWAT team would be just the right thing to get forever 
in the klink, while blowing up the story over the net might blow-up the 
klinks themselves...  It is all a question of return on investment, and what 
price you can afford.  Happily enough, we now have strong encryption and the 
net.  There is much less need to spill blood in order to disseminate 
information.

If the use of force was optimal, historically, we'd have been living in 
paradize since the first fight of all time happened.  Only, it doesn't work 
that way...

I wholeheartedly agree, but neither did they live in the same context.  
Beside, it was the only way they could act.  Nowadays, we have the phone and 
the net.  But I agree that without threath of physical action, no govt 
(itself based ultimately on physical threath) will ever stop doing just as 
it pleases him.  Only, you don't have to come up with big house blow-up 
things.  Only the menace of physical resistance and of the dissemination of 
information suffice.  The govt is fed by the voluntary actions of the 
citizenry.  The day large groups decide to stop paying taxes, the govt will 
simply starve and grind to a halt.
