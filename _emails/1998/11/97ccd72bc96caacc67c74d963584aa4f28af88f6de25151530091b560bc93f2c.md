____________________________ 
Brothers Beware: Games Black Women Play is a book that 
pulls no punches when it details the many tricks and 
manipulative games for which black women are notorious. 

This book is an honest, no holds barred, uncensored 
discussion about dating in the African American community. 

The number of eligible black men is constantly decreasing. 
Therefore, black women are doing whatever is necessary to 
find and keep a good black man. Many of her secrets are 
exposed in this book. 

The author interviewed several black women who revealed 
many of the techniques used by Sisters to get what they 
want, and who they want, any time they want. These women 
were especially helpful on the hilarious chapter entitled: 
"Games Women Play On Each Other." 

The author had no need whatsoever to embellish - 
The TRUTH was definitely sensational enough.
