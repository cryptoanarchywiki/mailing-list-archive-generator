Which is preferable IMHO, and I think most here agree (at least in this
context). As soon as you give some entity (e.g. government) the power of
force to regulate privacy, you create an entity that will abuse that force
and abuse privacy. Plus such regulations are a false security blanket that
diminishes demand for true privacy-creating tools (cryptography) -- not to
mention you current regime turns around and attacks those tools.

Being bound by the law of economics is generally a good thing.
