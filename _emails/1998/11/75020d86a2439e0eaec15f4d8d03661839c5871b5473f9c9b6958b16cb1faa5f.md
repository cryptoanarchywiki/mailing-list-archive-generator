Hello fellow Privacy Seeker,

Sorry, it took a little longer to respond, as I just came back from my trip to Central America. I made the first deliveries, and both programs run very well. As we are getting into the christmas season things are getting somewhat busy. Please read below all additional expalanations and act accordingly. 

Some general guidelines, organized like a FAQ:

1. What is included?

2. What is extra?
Gua: name change 3000, naturalization papers 1500
Nica: name change 2000, naturalization papers 1000

3. Special features:
Holders are entitled to naturalization in Spain after only two years' residency. This is valid for both countries.

4. Discounts available?
