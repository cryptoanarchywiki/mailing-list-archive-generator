IT'S CLASSIFIED: The Secret Service Will
Have a Hand In 2002 Security

BY GREG BURTON
THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE

A classified executive order signed by President Clinton during the summer
has altered the way the Secret Service prepares for security at national
events,
a change already affecting the blueprint for the 2002 Winter Olympics.

Presidential protection, often a hectic, hodgepodge operation, has been the
jurisdiction of the Secret Service since John Wilkes Booth shot President
Lincoln. Now, the presidential directive orders the Secret Service to take an
active role in planning security for major national events, whether or not
presidents, vice presidents, ex-presidents, their spouses or other dignitaries
attend.

Called Presidential Decision Directive 62 (PDD 62), the order also
reportedly alters a range of national security considerations, although the
directive's internal hardware is top secret. PDDs, like executive orders,
do not
require the approval of Congress but come through the National Security
Council.

For Salt Lake City, PDD 62 means Secret Service agents already are
planning for the orchestration of executive ogling at the Winter Olympics
without knowing who the president of the United States will be or if that
person will attend.

At the 1996 Summer Games, when the same shadowy squad led
then-first-term Clinton through the magnolia trees in Atlanta, security
experts
with the Secret Service did not begin preparing for the executive visit
until after
Olympic organizers and the FBI had completed their security plan.

``The public has this perception of the Secret Service as a strange
institution
that rides in and rides out with black glasses on,'' says Dennis Crandall,
resident agent in charge of the Secret Service for Utah and Idaho. ``This is
kind of a new era for us.''

PDD 62 now enters a vault of classified security directives.

Among other PDDs is No. 29, issued in 1994, that established the Security
Policy Board, a secretive agency with authority over information systems'
security and safeguarding classified information. The National Security
Council
has refused to release details of PDD 29.

PDD 62 likely will remain equally veiled.

``PDD 62 is not classified, but the contents are,'' says David M. Tubbs, the
recently appointed special agent in charge for the FBI's Utah, Idaho and
Montana command.

Says Crandall: ``Portions of it are still sensitive.''

According to several national security experts, the major event clause in
PDD 62 is an outgrowth of a perceived lack of security planning for the
president's visit to the Atlanta Games.

Because of PDD 62, the Secret Service has been involved nearly from the
onset of security planning for the 2002 Winter Games.

``We are designated to take a more aggressive upfront role in major
events,'' says Crandall. Currently, the FBI and the Secret Service are
hammering out a memorandum of understanding that clarifies the division of
labor between the two federal security teams in accordance with PDD 62.

The Secret Service's role -- although a topic that has reportedly led to turf
wars in Washington, D.C. -- has been welcomed by most Salt Lake City
organizers. Tubbs does not see their involvement as a threat to the FBI, the
lead federal security agency for the 2002 Olympics.

``I have not had a turf war with anyone. Period,'' says Tubbs, who was one
of several agents with direct security oversight during Atlanta. ``We are all
involved in the planning stages here, so what has happened in the past is
unimportant. What is important is what happens in 2002.''
