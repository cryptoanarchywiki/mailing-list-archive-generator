The problem isn't government, it's the people who enforce the government
that abuse it.

Absolutely. I happen to know a whole passel of beer, wine, and liqour
makers. Austin as aswim in micro-breweries. I'd be more than happy to pass
your email address to the enibriated set and let them argue the point with
you.

Actualy it's not the states (at least Texas and Louisiana), it's the local
cities. The state of Texas doesn't care as long as you pay your liquor
license and don't sell to minors and obey the local zoning ordinances.

I am on target. The fact that a unregulated alcohol industry led to death,
debilitation, and financial hardship justified the imposition of regulation
on alcohol and its related operations.

You just don't want the entire picture painted because it cast a harsh light
on the premise that un-regulated economies are good things.

Yeah, you meant to commit an act of ommission so that your position looks
more favorable than it actualy does.

Really? Drugs are what $10B US a year or so. I bet stolen automobiles when
taken as a whole gross more loss than that. And what makes you think that
the vast majority of that drugs aren't purchased at the street level with
funds gotten from theft? The drugs may not be stolen, the dollar that they
were bought with was in most cases.

Let me know when you figure that one out.

Still doesn't answer my question.

Ah, so you admit that the general mechanism to settle inter-personal dispute
under your plan is to allow people to run around shooting each other.

Well, at least we've got an honest admission that murder would be legal in
this system.
