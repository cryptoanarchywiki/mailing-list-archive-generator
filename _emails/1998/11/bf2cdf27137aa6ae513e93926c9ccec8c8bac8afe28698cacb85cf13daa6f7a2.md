				ARTICLE I. 
 
	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, 
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of 
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, 
and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. 
 
 
 
				ARTICLE II. 
 
	A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a 
free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be 
infringed. 
 

I'd say that 'shall make no law' is a clear as 'shall not be infringed' and
pretty equivalent in meaning.

See, no shit-storm (they reserve that for me...;).
