No, I made a typo. I got so focused on primes last nite that I seem to have
typed it in instead of 'even'. I didn't notice it when I saw it posted to
the list. My mistake, sorry for the confusion.

What started this whole enquiry for me was the realization that the
multiplication identity axiom is related to the definition of a prime. Then
add on top of that the reason we exclude 1 is so we don't have to write
'...except for the prime 1' on the end of lots of number theory (re Richard
Feynman's comment during the Challenger Investigation). It was the 
realization that if we go ahead and include 1 so the axioms are in line with
each other (and use our cut&paste feature for the '...1...') then perhaps it
would provide a more consistent base and just maybe some of the extant
problems in number theory might become solvable in other ways. My original
intention was to get a copy of Doug Lenat's EURISKO theorem proving program
and change the definition of prime in its database and note the results
(after converting it to Perl from LISP). What started all that is that I'm
slowly going through 'An Introduction to Algebraic Structures' by J. Landin
(Dover) creating a cheat-sheet of number theory that eventualy I hope to post
on my webpage for reference.
