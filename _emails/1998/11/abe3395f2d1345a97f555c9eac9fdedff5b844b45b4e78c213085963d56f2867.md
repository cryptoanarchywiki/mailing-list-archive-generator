If you're talking about the people who didn't vote, they're trying to keep
from going under. Probably working two jobs, keeping the kids in school and
out of trouble, saving for college, paying the house morgage off, etc. Who's
in office won't make a whit of difference to any of that. It's irrelevant.

If you're talking about the politicians, they're laughing their ass off on
the way to the bank to cash their tax-derived income.
