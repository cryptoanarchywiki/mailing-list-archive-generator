I have noticed something else: 

Our networks (NBC, ABC, CBS etc) will interview a politician, on camera, 
and then immediately afterwards tell the viewers/listeners WHAT HE SAID!

I am not talking about commentary, extrapolations, consequences, comparison
with other opinions, commantaries about the truth or falsehood of what whas
said,
no, the TVnetspeakcritter will  say "Well, we heard President Ougadougou
Cleptocrate 
say that....." even when the interviewee spoke English, or was dubbed. 

Bye the way, for reasons related to those in the original mail, I much prefer
subtitles to dubbing, as the speaker's voice gives away many clues, even if I
am unfamiliar with his language.

Regards

Nils Andersson
