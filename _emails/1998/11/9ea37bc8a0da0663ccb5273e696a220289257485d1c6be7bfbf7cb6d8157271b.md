True, at least under a democratic system we can prevent some of the more
gross abuses by government and can address the inter-personal issues with
something besides a nylon jacketed .357. Your anarcho-whatever doesn't even
provide that.

Several cops in Houston were fired (they got no-billed by the Grand Jury)
just last week because of a similar issue. There are two cops here in Austin
who went to jail because of a murder (they held a kid down on a water bed
and he suffocated) charge. The current public overwatch group was the result
of a police call that got out of hand last year and the police had two
choices - either give the people what they asked for or end loose the civil
rights case. The two cops who beat Rodney King ended up doing time.

Nobody proved to the jury beyond a shadow of a doubt he was guilty. It is
far better to let a dozen guilty men go free than to imprison a single
innocent one. Our legal system may have its problem but I guarantee that a
lot more guilty people get off scott free than innocent people end up in
jail.

There is more than a little justice under the current system (OJ being the
perfect example - like it or not).

> 	We have courts of Law, Justice is ashamed to show her face.

Somehow I doubt that. If justice is ashamed of anything its that citizens of
this country don't participate more and express their views with more
conviction.

Which, considering that anarchic systems permit murder, theft, rape,
extortion, etc. without reprisal or limits, means that the vast majority of
people are probably going to sleep a sounder sleep knowing they don't have
to go out and buy a tank tomorrow just to make sure they have a home to come
to in the evening.

If nothing works for large numbers of people then why should this? Anarchy
isn't freedom, it's opportunity to make huge profits with no responsiblity
and at the expence of others (who are treated as a market commodity and not
human beings).
