So, does the ADL censor Farrakan?  

Will the white supremecists publish their own 
"screen" to keep their brood pure ?

Jewish censorware.  Gotta love the irony.

Time to re-fluoridate my precious bodily fluids.

ADL And Learning Co. Create Hate Filter

BOSTON (Reuters) - The Anti-Defamation League, which has been monitoring
hate groups for 85 years, has teamed up with educational software
maker The Learning Co. to create a filter that screens out hate sites on
the Internet.

Dubbed the ADL HateFilter and available from the ADL's Web site
(www.adl.org), parents can install the screen on home computers and thereby
keep
``bigotry and prejudice out of their homes,'' ADL National Chairman Howard
Berkowitz said.

The ADL HateFilter sits atop the Learning Co.'s Cyber Patrol product, a
filter that is used by both parents and teachers to block children's access to
Internet sites ''containing drug information, sexual text, nudity. Things
that parents may consider inappropriate for children,'' a spokeswoman for
Cambridge, Mass.-based software maker said.

The ADL HateFilter does not just screen hate sites, but also provides a
link to obtain information about the hate groups, the Learning Co.'s Susan
Getgood said.

``We've basically been doing this for 85 years, we just transferred the
information to the Internet,'' explained ADL spokeswoman Myrna Shinbaum.

The sites filtered are those that in the ADL's judgment advocate hatred,
bigotry or even violence toward Jews or other groups on the basis of their
religion, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other immutable
characteristics.

The ADL, founded in 1913, is holding its 85th annual National Commission
meeting in Boston.
