You're speaking of federal taxes, or you don't own property in your own
name. I suppose you wouldn't call the fire dept. if your house caught on
fire since you don't pay taxes. You wouldn't call the police if there was a
problem either.

No, my intent in wording is to get at the core of what is being proposed. A
characteristic of anarcho-whatever and lawyers is they never say what they
mean. If they did very few would give them the attention they get now.

IROFL.
