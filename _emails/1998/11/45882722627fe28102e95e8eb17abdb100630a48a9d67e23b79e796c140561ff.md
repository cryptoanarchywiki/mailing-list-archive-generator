MILLENNIUM BUG POSES NUCLEAR WEAPONS RISK 

The British American Security Information Council on Thursday is warning all
world military powers to de-activate their
weapons, to avoid possible "massive and hugely perilous systems failures"
brought on by the so-called Millennium bug. 

The group singles out the United States, bluntly describing the Pentagon's
efforts to meet the fast-approaching deadline
as "a mess" -- with what it calls "severe and recurring problems across the
spectrum." 

The INDEPENDENT newspaper in London on Thursday outlined the council's warning. 

"The biggest YK2 danger is not the ultimate nightmare of nuclear weapons either
launching or exploding because of faulty
computer information. Since it still requires human authorization for a missile
or warhead to be launched, this sort of
catastrophe is unrealistic. Far more likely, however, is the prospect of a
leader, under pressure from hairtrigger
response mechanisms, pressing the nuclear button on the basis of inaccurate
data." 

The council would like to see world powers "separate warheads from their
delivery vehicles" when the clocks flip 2000-- a
move that would dramatically increase the amount of time needed to launch an
attack.
