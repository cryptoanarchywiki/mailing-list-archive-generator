Where does he say that Bill? And while it ain't religious, there are some
perferences to having it open source versus controlled source.

Wrong, since the ENTIRE OS is run under this it's not nearly that simple.
The OS's internal swap page as well as by extension the contexts they point
to are going to be sitting in there. The app should also encrypt the address
spaces of the system structures.

Where in that description does it say it allows particular apps to use this
product?

You don't know this but you're willing to try to rake me....

Talk about unprepared.

Your guess is pretty much worthless. What we'd like is an aswer from the
person who wrote it.
