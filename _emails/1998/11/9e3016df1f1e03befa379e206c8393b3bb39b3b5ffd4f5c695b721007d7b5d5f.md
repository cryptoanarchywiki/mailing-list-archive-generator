It is the duty of all to say "Hey! respect intellectual property!" 
I too am against piracy, now I know that that software i.e statgraphics
is not a shareware. 

Thank you.
Exactly my point
  it is OK if you say
    "it is not OK with us if you send warez requests to the list."
  it is not OK if you say ".... fuck yourself"
