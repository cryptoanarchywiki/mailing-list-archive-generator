These conjectures are equivalent for numbers > 6. I think that the
discussion of whether numbers 4 and 6 can be expressed as sum of
two primes is completely uninteresting.

Also, since 6 = 3+3, I question why they put strict inequality (> 6)
in the definition on p 673. I think that they could say n > 4. Not that
it matters in any respect.

So I do not see them as "substantially" different, and the difference
between these conjectures does not lead us to any profound thoughts.
