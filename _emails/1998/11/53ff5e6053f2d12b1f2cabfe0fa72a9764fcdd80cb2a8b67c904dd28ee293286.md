Jim Choate is so stupid that even when he accidentally gets something
right, he quickly "corrects" himself so that he is wrong again:

Wrong, doofus.  x/ln(x) is the correct asymptotic limit.  What role could
logs to the base 10 possibly play?  Do you think God favors the number 10?
What a fool you are!
