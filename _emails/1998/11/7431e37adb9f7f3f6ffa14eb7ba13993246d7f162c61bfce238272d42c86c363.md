				ARTICLE V. 
 
	No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise 
infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, 
except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, 
when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any 
person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of 
life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness 
against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property without 
due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, 
without just compensation. 
 
 
 
				ARTICLE VI. 
 
	In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right 
to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and 
district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district 
have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the 
nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses 
against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his 
favor, and to have Assistance of Counsel for his defence.

By definition a jury is more than one, it's the reason they are implimented;
to moderate the biases of the individual.

Secondly, a judge is not impartial when acting in the stead of the state in
two capacities at one time. Especialy when by their very nature they are at
least to some degree confrontational.

Dem's da rules bubba. The Kennedy lawyers should be throwing civil right
shit fits about now.
