>    preventing the Justice Department from enforcing the Child Online
>    Protection Act (COPA), an anti-pornography law Congress passed in
>    October.
>    
>    Judge Lowell Reed's decision will delay enforcement of the law until
>    at least Dec. 4. The injunction came in response to a lawsuit filed by
>    free speech advocates, filed just one day after the legislation was
>    signed by President Clinton.
