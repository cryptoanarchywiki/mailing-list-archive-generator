>From Jim Choate:

: The question was how would an anarchic system work in this respect, not how
: do governments, relief organizations, and the general public act now.
................................................


The answer is that you cannot know in advance.   Since anarchies are not formal
societies, there would exist no centralized formal structures, so therefore such
behavior cannot be predicted.   Responses to emergeny situations would depend
upon the psychology of those who are living in anarchy.  Predicting how they
would "work", when no one is coerced to function, requires imagining the
potential for normal responses available to those who are free from remote
control, who can decide for themselves whether they care, and what they're going
to do about it, if anything.
