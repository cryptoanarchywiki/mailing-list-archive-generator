People abuse people, it's why anarcho-anything won't work. Quit confusing
human nature with political systems. Democracy recognizes that individuals
are abused, and that they are wont to accept that abuse until it becomes
truly excessive (which our country isn't by a long shot). It's the reason
the individual is given a vote and civil liberties.

If you seriously think you're going to pass a set of laws ( or by extension
throw the ones we have out) and the world will be a better place then you
are one confused puppy.
