Yes, I do.  I do not buy the domain check idea due to the unworkability in a
changing and multi-faceted society.  I do not buy the concept the anyone
that sends a piece that you don't want is a "spammer" (there really are
enough of them out there already without diluting the Title through
misnomers.) I do not buy attacking symptoms and ignoring causes -- and in
this case Causers.
