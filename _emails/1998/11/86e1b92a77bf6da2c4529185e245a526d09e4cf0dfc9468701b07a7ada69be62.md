Cop-out. "It's the same but different" is spin-doctor bullshit.

Explain how the system works. Explain how the various systems operate, how
the costs are calculated, and how they're paid. I want to see the same level
of *specificity* that I and others have agreed to provide you in our
examples.

We want an answer not some glib off the shoulder quip.

[I'm deleting the rest of this since it doesn't answer any questions that
have been posed to the anarcho-whatever side]
