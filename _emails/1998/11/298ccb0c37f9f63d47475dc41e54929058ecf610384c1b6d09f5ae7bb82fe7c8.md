That pretty much covers anyone other than a end-user/subscriber. This means
anonymous remailers, mailing list hosting services, email services, etc.

Does 'hosted material' mean material that is put up by the ISP itself or
does it also include material made available by subscribers?

Wait a second, I'm no cop. If somebody places copyrighted material on SSZ
for example I can see bringing suite against that party, but forcing me to
punish them by removing their account is over the line. Do I get restitution
for lost services from the copyright holder since I'm acting as their agent?

So this is voluntary?

Imposition of *any* cost is a substantial burden.
