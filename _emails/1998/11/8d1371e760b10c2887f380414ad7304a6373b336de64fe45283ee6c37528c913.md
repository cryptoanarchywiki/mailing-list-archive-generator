Why would this be "unconstitutional?"

Are you at all familiar with the case? There seems to be a fair amount of 
evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, that would indicate a certain 
politically and financially powerful family used its influence to keep 
the two prime suspects in the case from coming to trial for over 20 
years.

One judge is better than nothing. OTOH, maybe a football, a few pine 
trees, and some vertical slope would do justice. 

(Or do you think there should be a statute of limitations involved?) 

-r.w.
