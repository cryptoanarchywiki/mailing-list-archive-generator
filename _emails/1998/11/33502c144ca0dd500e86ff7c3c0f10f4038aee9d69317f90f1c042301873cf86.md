However much I may or may not agree with you, that is an entirely subjective
judgement. In political context, anarchy = without rule of government --
nothing more, nothing less. That necessarily means you will have freedom
from government, but does not imply you will have freedom from others. Ditto
for privacy. In fact there is good claim that privacy will not exist in
anarchy except by those that decide to use the tools and methods to achieve
it -- cat and mouse game same as today, except the corporate cats are bound
by economics (the value of data to them versus the cost to obtain it)
whereas government cats are not.
