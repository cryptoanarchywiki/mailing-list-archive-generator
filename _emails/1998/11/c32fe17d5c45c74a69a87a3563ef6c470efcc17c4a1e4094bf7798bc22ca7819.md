I thought the name Vinod Vallopillil was familiar as of someone who was on
cpunks for a while, in 1995.   If my memory serves me well, I think it was him
who for a while he had this idea of putting together some learning
lectures/sessions locally on economics.   I expressed interest, but then he left
for school again (he was an intern at MS at the time).   I checked the archives
for his name, and found some of his posts on "credit card conventional wisdom".
This is what was on his sig in a 1995:
