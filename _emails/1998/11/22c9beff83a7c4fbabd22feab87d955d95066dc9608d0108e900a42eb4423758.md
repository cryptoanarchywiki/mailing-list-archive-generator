And then, if they _do_ decide to take action, black helicopters start
circling your house, using mind-control rays to bend you to Microsoft's
will.  If this doesn't cut it (say, you're wearing a tin-foil hat), the
men in black show up and remove your whole computer, and then use their
memory-zapping thingy to erase any memory of ever having a computer.
You'll then be officially branded as a dangerous outlaw subversive type
(even though you no longer have your PIRATE/COPIED/UNLICENSED software,
you've demonstrated that you're the type of person who will _get_ such
software) and will not be able to get jobs, insurance, loans, etc.  MS
will tap your phone, and their agents will follow your every move.

: There is already 54 cases in Singapore regarding uses of
: PIRATE/COPIED/UNLICENSED Windows 98.

Finally, when the revolution comes, MS will see to it that your house is
high on the list of sites for the UN invaders to hit with tactical
nukes.

: Is there any Substance to this Email ??

It's all true.  I had to go public with this information, even though
the MS stormtroopers will doubtless show up at any second now.  The
people have a right to know.  DON'T EVER GO ON LINE!!!  YOUR LIFE
DEPENDS ON IT!!!!

: Do you Guys think that there exists such a registry in Windows 98
: Has microsoft sued anybody for illegal use of it ??

Sued?  SUED???!!?  When MS gets through with you, you're going to WISH
that they'd jusT SUED you!  These people are EVIL!!! They kidnapped my
dog and G$%<S-F4>@^<S-F6>RB. f
NO CARRIER
