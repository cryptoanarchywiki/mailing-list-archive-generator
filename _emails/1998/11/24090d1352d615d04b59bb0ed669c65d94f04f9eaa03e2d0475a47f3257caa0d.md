Would you like to know whether it is "fair use" to repost entire articles?

I would.

"Innocent" is hardly an accurate description of Michele Moore.

Would you like Information Security to cough up more
color on his netcopping move?

Hey, you ratted me out to the IP list!

But, when sites get smarter about using server-side includes,
the I/O delays will still be there.

I think ISPs should offer a proxy service for WWW access. They have
bigger pipes.

This could include an opt-in (configure through an ISP-local WWW page)
adbuster. At the same time, it would to a certain extent anonymize
access.

And let's say cable-modem access becomes wide-spread, and legislation
forces the cable companies to allow ISP choice. I think ISPs that offer
some privacy in user access over this shared medium will have a leg-up
on their competition.

That would involve software residing local to the user's box that
would encrypt access between them and the ISP for WWW, email, ftp, etc.
More than just ssh.

Hey, then you would finally have ads that make clear what encryption
is for the average user: picture two neighbors going to work in the
morning meeting in the elevator, and one starts hinting he knows
what the other was receiving for email, which sites he was surfing...

Maybe the Anonymizer.com people will release/sell such software for ISPs,
and, of course, sans GAK.
