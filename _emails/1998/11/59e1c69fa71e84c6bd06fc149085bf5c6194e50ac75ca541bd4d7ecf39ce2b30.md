I am searching for a source code reference implementation of the CDSA V2.0 standard
as published by the Open Group. I know that a freely available implementation has been
released by IBM (MIT Jonah PKIX Freeware, can be downloaded from http://web.mit.edu/pfl) 
but this is legally accessible only for US citizen.

I have tried to spot the CDSA source but have not found anything up to now.

Has this software found its way outside the US yet? I'd like to put my fingers on it
without actually breaking fed laws... 


Thanx.
