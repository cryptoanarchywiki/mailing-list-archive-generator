	Then again, it could be that after all the "secessionism and
freedom fighting" are done with, the resulting "disorder" (as in lack of
rulers) will be so ubiquitous that *WARS* will no longer happen, as there
is no one to lead the armies. and no one paying taxes to support those
armies.

	That then would be peasce, no?
