All even numbers greater than two can be represented as the sum of 
TWO primes.

Goldbach originally suggested that all numbers greater than two could be
expressed as the sum of three primes, if one tossed in 1 as a prime
number.  Euler pointed out that this was equivalent to even numbers
greater than two being expressed as the sum of two primes. 

This seemed a somewhat cleaner formulation, and it was adopted.
