Hold on right here, Jim.

Do you mean a sum of DIFFERENT primes?

Because any number greater than 1 can be represented as a sum of some 2s
and some 3s. 

E.g. 8 = 3+3+2, 9 = 3+3+3, 10 = 3+3+2+2, etc.

Since this is so boring, I assume that the primes must be different.

Well, take 11, for example, it cannot be repsesented as a sum of different
primes. It cannot, pure and simple.

So, the above hypothesis is incorrect. No need for high powered math here.

Why, let's say 5 = 3+2, it is a sum of an even number of primes.

I suggest that first "examination" should always include playing
with trivial examples.

If multiple instances are allowed, it is an enormously boring conjecture
for 5 grade school students.

any number above 1 may be represented as a sum of some 3s and some
2s. Big deal.
