Nonsense. I am not "implicated" as an accessory to anything. Speak for
yourself only.

There is no basis in law for the notion that several hundred subscribers to
a mailing list are implicated in something because others talk about it.
Get real.

As for the claim that we are "lusers" if we don't report this request, let
us know how your own report is received. I will check for your posts
regularly, and report you to the proper authorities if you fail in your
self-declared duty here.
