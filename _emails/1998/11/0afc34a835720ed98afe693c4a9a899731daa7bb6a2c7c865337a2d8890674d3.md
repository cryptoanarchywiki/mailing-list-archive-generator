I obviously don't defend morons everywhere -- I didn't defend Mr Anonymous.

I regularly send from one domain while requesting a "something" to be dealt
with through another domain.  (A little something called work, for instance.
Shoot, even the ACM.Org address doen't pass that check but it certainly is
valid and unambiguously mine.

My point exactly -- so when you want to ream someone for the half gig MPEG,
ream the requester.

You

The totality is not Okay.  But the individual systems that were solicited to
send are not at fault, assuming that they give me an out.  OTOH the asshole
that requested it all is quite another topic. That "spammer" is the one that
should be taken to task.

there is a significant difference between buying a list and answering a
request.  Granted that the net effect of having a confirmation message sent
to some one person shows little difference, but the methodology and intent
are nt the same at all.

The analogous activities have been going on for many years and they have
never been a Good Thing.

Anyone that believes that a domain check will do anything other than check a
domain is delusional.  Hey, they even think like the post awful -- one
person, one email address.

Why, thank you.  But it is not really needed.

I never cease to be amazed at how little grasp of the concept of causality
so many presumably technically literate people are today.

When one wishes to remove a problem, it is a much better approach to attack
the cause than to attack the symptom.
