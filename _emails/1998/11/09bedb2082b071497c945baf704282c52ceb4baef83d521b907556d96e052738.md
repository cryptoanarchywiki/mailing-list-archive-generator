Hi,

Actually, the interest that would be earned through savings accounts
and/or any other bank-related investments is insignificant when 
compared to returns on business investments that can be made without
the interference of the banks and government agencies. 

FYI, I was kidding about the money in the steel case on the App Trail, 
but I really do not have any bank accounts or credit cards.  I have
yet to find an honest banker/bank that can be trusted.

Ken
