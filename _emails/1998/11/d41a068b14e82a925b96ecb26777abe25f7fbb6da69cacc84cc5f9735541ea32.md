Like I said, if you don't corrupt the meaning of free market.

Laissez Faire capitalism is based on a concept of individual rights.
Therefore the proper role of any government (in a libertarian state) or
individual/social institution (in rational anarchy) is to protect individual
rights (life, liberty, property), and act as an objective framework for
retributive force.

Therefore, any transaction that violates individual rights is immoral (if
not illegal) and constitutes a black market.

e.g. assassinations, ransom, stolen goods, extortion, slavery, etc.

To create a anarcho-capitalist definition of free market where everything
goes and there is no concept of individual rights is as immoral and perverse
as the statist concepts that similarly have no concept of individual rights
(fascism, communism).
