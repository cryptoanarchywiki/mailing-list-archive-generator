Absolutely, and it is not limited to credit cards.  It would pop up if, for
example, you buy a new car.  If your rating does become negatively
affected, the creditor could care less about your explanation of some Joe
Anonymous using your SSN.  His first question would be why didn't you
report it when you found out.  Whatever credit you'd be applying for would
get unbelievably mired in beaucracy - something you wouldn't need.
  
Additionally, it can mushroom in other areas as well.  This other person is
getting credit for the number of years that you have been employed.  Also,
if s/he applies for SSD or SSI (disability or supplemental security
income), you will be impacted upon.  Some states require SSN's for driving
licenses, and there's a myriad of potential problems here as well.  Tax
returns can potentially become a complication.  And the list goes on....

All in all, you should seriously reconsider your decision of not reporting
the problem.
