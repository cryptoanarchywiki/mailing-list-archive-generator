I don't know if this was supposed to have gone to Bugtraq, or it came to me
because I 'visited' their "snoop server" acoupla times.  If you already rec'd
the original, then "Never Mind".

>I've discovered some attacks against the original PipeNet design. The new
>protocol, PipeNet 1.1, should fix the weaknesses. PipeNet 1.1 uses layered
>sequence numbers and MACs. This prevents a collusion between a receiver
>and a subset of switches from tracing the caller by modifying or swaping
>packets and then watching for garbage.
>
>A description of PipeNet 1.1 is available at
>http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai.
>
>Also available there is a description of b-money, a new protocol for
>monetary exchange and contract enforcement for pseudonyms. 
>
>Please direct all follow-up discussion of these protocols to cypherpunks.
