	Subject: Frames security hole

	There is a description and demo of a security hole with frames in web
	browsers at http://www.securexpert.com/framespoof/start.html - there is
	a version that works without javascript enabled as well.

I checked it out, and it's way cool.  You open some frame-using target page,
such as www.citibank.com, in Netscape or Internet Exploder,
and cliok on their hack, and a new frame appears on the target page,
replacing some frame that belonged there.  They say they can fake out
Netscape's "key" icon that claims that an https: page is secure,
though I didn't have any handy frame-based https pages to test with.

Technical Discussion: http://www.securexpert.com/framespoof/tech.html
Some defenses http://www.securexpert.com/framespoof/defense.html
==> but the rel defense is getting your browser vendor to fix the browser.
Meanwhile, don't trust any web page with frames with any
information you care too much about.
				Thanks!
