Man, that is what I call a loaded statement.  It speaks volumes.

First I heard about this.  Is this some sort of NWO move to "harmonize"
tax levels worldwide so that no one can escape their clutches?  Someone
should tell New Zealand, which apparently is rescinding income taxes
altogether after 2000.

My guess is that the Cayman Islands are going to buy some political
representation (as if they already haven't)

"Harmful tax competition".  "Sensitise".  ROTFLOL.

Countering tax havens with what?  Gunboat diplomacy?  Tax the hell out
of your citizens or we bomb you!
