Observe: --begin pasted text--

Amendment I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances.


Amendment II
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. 

--end pasted text--

While the 2nd does say "well regulated", it should also be pointed out that
the 1st does not say "right OF THE PEOPLE", except in the freedom of
assembly clause.

So why did you?
