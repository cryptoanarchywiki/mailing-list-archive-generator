When it is non-profit, and is equivalent to my neighbor bringing his morning
paper over to show me a story (I don't subscribe to the paper so I haven't a
license with the copyright holder in principle or practice) he wants to talk
about.

With the way the law is going that will soon be illegal for me to even look
at the paper, though we can probably still talk about it.

Though the probable next step is to make even that verbal recitation
illegal.
