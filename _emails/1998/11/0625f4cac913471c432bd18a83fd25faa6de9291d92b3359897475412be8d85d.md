If this is boiling down to a definition of primes, I'll haul out my Hardy &
Wright, page 2:

    A number p is said to be prime if (i) p > 1, (ii) p has no positive
    divisors except 1 and p.  ...  It is important to observe that 1 is not
    reckoned as a prime.

My number theory class at college (admittedly that was three decades ago)
also started the prime series at 2 and went up from there.  The term
"odd primes" always meant 3 and above, not 1 and above.

YMMV.
