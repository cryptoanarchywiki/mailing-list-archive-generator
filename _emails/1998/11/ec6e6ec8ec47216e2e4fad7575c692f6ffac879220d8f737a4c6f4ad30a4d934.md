Absolutely. It's what is meant by indipendent nation. It's between the leaders
and the citizens.

> 	What about rule by law?

What about it? I don't believe in one world governments, it's a bad idea.
Within the confines of a given country there should be a rule of law, that
rule should not necessarily be the same as any other country. And other
countries should most definitely NOT have a say in it.

Do you want Germany having a say in our laws (for example)?

No, the point was about freedom of choice.

Taxing went on, the regulation of alcohol production didn't occur in this
country until after the Civil War. Taxing alcohol is a whole different issue
than regulating the quality and methods of production, and is most certainly
not equivalent to regulations on where it might be sold and under what
conditions.

No it doesn't. The press is a business, and if you don't think they don't
try to manipulate more than the government you're in for a surprise. There
are cases of the press being manipulated because of the impact of certain
story presentation lines on their income.

Actualy not, there are a variety of whistle-blower laws on the book at every
level. Also the number of whistle-blowers who are killed currently are
pretty small (name 3). A lot of them loose the jobs they blew the whistle on
but that is many cases is to be expected (after all if the issue is important
enough the business will cease to exist).

No it doesn't, it does not in any way prevent abuse and further provides no
mechanism for the restitution or correction of that abuse.

>

No, the point is that whoever is the most ruthless will get ahead. If you
don't think that is power then you should sit and think.

Such as? Greed and profit always can be pushed through business, it's what
they do.

Which requires that yot mislead the doctor as to why you want them.

Why would anyone buy a commenly available item on the black market when they
could go to the corner store and purchase it? They won't. People who are
involved in the black market are there for profit. If they go down to the
store and buy say tomatoes at $2/lb. whey would they sell them to you at
$1.75/lb? They wouldn't. The alcohol and cigarettes you buy on the black
market lack tax stamps are have bogus stamps. Why? Becuase the cost is much
lower without the added tax and legitimate distribution expenses.

 Before that you were maintaining
> that everything on the black market had to be stolen, and in fact this

No, go back - I never said that. I have continously said that the majority
of items on the black market are related to a stolen service or product.
I stand by that statement.

I'd go on but it's been a long day and I'm in no mood for this petty
bickering.
