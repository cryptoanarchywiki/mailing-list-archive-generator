No-one's yet noticed that my Jim's house burning down is a problem for
his neighbours.  Not just for the fear and distress it causes them but
because the fire might spread to their houses.  Which is why we have
fire brigades. And why they are nearly always paid for out of tax.
Almost the last thing in the world anyone does privately.  

Of course, that applies to cities, not to the country - but cities are
where it's at.
