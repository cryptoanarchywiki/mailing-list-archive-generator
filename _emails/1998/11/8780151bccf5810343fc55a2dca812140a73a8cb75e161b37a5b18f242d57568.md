No, that was Fermat, Goldbach just says every even number greater than two
can be represented as a sum of primes. Basicaly Fermat says that if we have
n primes we can reduce them to 2 primes only, in all cases. Which happens to
exclude using equilateral triangles as a test bed since you can't tile a
equilateral with only two other equilaterals, you could use rectangles though.
So basicaly from a geometric perspective Fermat says that given a rectangle of
even area it is possible to divide it with a bisector into two rectangles of
prime area.

It's interesting that Fermat doesn't mention that the only prime that can
use two as a factor is 4. And you can't factor 2 at all since we eliminate
1 as a potential candidate (another issue of symmetry breaking simply so we
don't have to write '....works for every prime but 1' on all our theorems).

The real issue for me is the interaction of primes (ie n * 1 = n) and the
identity theorem (ie n * 1 = n). They're opposite sides of the same coin.

It doesn't really matter now since it doesn't look like I'm going to get a
copy of EURISKO in this lifetime to play with.
