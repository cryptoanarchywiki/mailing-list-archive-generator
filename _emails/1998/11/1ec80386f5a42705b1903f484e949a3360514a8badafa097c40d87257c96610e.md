Sorry for the slow reply. Any http anonymizer not using link padding is
subject to trivial traffic analysis. See the "Pipe-net" thread in the
archive. Also see the graphs at http://www.onion-router.net/Vis.html

What makes the graphs all the more impressive is that the OR people used
to argue against my claim that you need link padding. They don't argue any
more. ;-)
