Pure disinformation.   It does have a few locally-customized twists to it.
As another poster said, you can get the source from www.pgpi.com,
check it out yourself, and compile it yourself.

There are some versions that have features allowing you to encrypt
data to multiple recipients, and some versions allow you to set this
with one or more recipients as the default (e.g. yourself,
or your corporate security officer.)  But you do not need to set this.

There are also some design bugs in the early DOS versions that make
them weaker than the later DOS versions or the newer versions,
so you don't want to use anything before 2.5 anyway.
				Thanks!
