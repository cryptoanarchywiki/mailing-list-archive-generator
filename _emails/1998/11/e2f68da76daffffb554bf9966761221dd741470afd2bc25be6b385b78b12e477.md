Hi!  I received that today.  Maybe it can interest some of you.

========== excerpt ============

I Am Not a Number! Policy Spotlight on National ID Cards
--------------------------------------------------------
http://www.free-market.net/features/spotlight/9811.html

While most of us weren't looking, the U.S. Congress passed two bills
that effectively authorize national ID cards. One was a law to reform
health insurance that included a provision for a "Unique Patient
Identifier." The other was an immigration law that required all U.S.
states to include Social Security numbers on drivers' licenses.

"Cryptography is like literacy in the Dark Ages. Infinitely potent, for good and ill... yet basically an intellectual construct, an idea, which by its nature will resist efforts to restrict it to bureaucrats and others who deem only themselves worthy of such Privilege."
