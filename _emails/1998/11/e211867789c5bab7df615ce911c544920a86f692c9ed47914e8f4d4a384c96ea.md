Nopes.

It's an  implementation of blowfish.

you might get some info at www.signotron.com
the guy at the fair claimed that it's the strongest existing
implementation of cryptography available in the world to date .. and he
was no "sales" guy - seemed technical enough ... 

what this s/w seems to be doing is that it gets into ur windows OS,
(works ONLY on windows) and everytime you "save" a file, it captures it,
encrypts it, and stores it .. so nothing on your disc is ever left
unencrypted.

ofcourse there must be a lot of such packages in the US .. but the
novelty here, according to this guy was that it was developed outside
the US, and it's price (USD 40) ....
