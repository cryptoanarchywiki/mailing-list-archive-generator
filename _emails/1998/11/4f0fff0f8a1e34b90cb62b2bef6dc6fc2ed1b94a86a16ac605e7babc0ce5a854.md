A quick question for all you security-savvy people.  Our IT instructor has
asked the class to sign up for verisigns' 60-day trial of a class 1 digital
id.  

pfaugh.  give me a copy of PGP anyday!  at least I can (easily) take my
keys with me!

I also understand that a well (poorly?) written activeX applet can grab my
key basically without my knowledge (to speak nothing of the other myriad
holes in win98/95)

My question is, where the hell is the private key kept on the users box?
How is it protected against attack? I had to voice my displeasure with the
instructor that I could not take the ID with me on a floppy so that the
night class would not have potential access, but got the usual 'it is
secure enough, let it be' attitude.

Thanks in advance for any information!
