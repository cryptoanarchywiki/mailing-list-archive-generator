Well, I suppose negative numbers can't be included because 1 can't be included:
1*1*1*1=1 and the idea is that a prime can only have itself and 1 as factors,
where 1 can be factored by itself over and over to an infinite number of 1's,
and by that definition you can exclude -1 since -1=(-1*1*-1*1), and so if
we take -5 and factor it to -5 and 1 it's good, but it can also be factored
to -1 and 5.  IMHO 1 and -1 being shunned in this way is a bit silly, but
whatever... :^)  (Same applies to zero since 0=0*0*0*0*0, but zero has the
built in difference of that it can't be divided by itself at all.)

So I guess I have to take back 7+5+(-1) and go with Jim's 1+3+7, but fuck,
that won't work either since 1 isn't a prime...  So I guess Igor is right on
this one.  Sorry Jim... 

Any other ideas on 11?
