Insurance regulatory agencies who monitor the behavior, investigation by a
reasonably impartial fire dept after every fire. That's at least two.

What police and security forces? You mean the ones the same insurance
company co-oped?

What makes you thing that Company A or B will even advertise their actions?

Who says the homes will be burned when the residents are even home? It isn't
like anyone is going to ask their permission.

And I'm the 'fucking idiot'.
