Bernardo Terrado:  take your motherfucking, goddamned sorry warez ass to FUCKING hell!

personally, i have nothing against an individual who wants to get some free shitty pirated software (*i'm* certainly NO warez pup, mind you), i'm a very open-minded anarchist/libertarian, i use Linux, GNUware, etc...(shit!  those bloodsucking faggots at the IRS have enough to develop a profile of me now), but what *really* FUCKING offends me is when some cocksmoker like your sorry fucking "Rico Suave" self come onto this list and gets FUCKING offended by a motherFUCKing word like "FUCK".

FUCK YOU Bernardo!  no wait, F U C K  Y O U, bernardo!  FUCK YOU.

Sincerely FUCK OFF, Bernardo, you stupid fucknut.
