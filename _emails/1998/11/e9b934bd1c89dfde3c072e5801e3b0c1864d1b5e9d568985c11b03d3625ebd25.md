No doubt it would be rude to point out that it was Tim May's aggressive
defense of off-topic postings that has made cypherpunks a safe haven
for the likes of Jim Choate.

As for Choate, perhaps his least charming trait is his insistence on
posting his incoming private email to the mailing list, as though
cypherpunks were his personal mailbox.  He even scolds people who have
the courtesy to take off-topic discussions to private email.

This behavior is exactly the opposite of appropriate mailing list
etiquette.  Choate is like a little boy who feels a fart coming on when in
the bathroom, and who runs into the living room to share it with guests.
His particular stench has been fouling the list for far too long.
