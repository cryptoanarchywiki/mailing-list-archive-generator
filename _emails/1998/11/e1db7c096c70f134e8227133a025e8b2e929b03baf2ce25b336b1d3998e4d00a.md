Fortunately for the alleged assh*le, there are likely lots of people
(i.e. _firemen_) who are willing to come and put out his fire, if Mr.
assh*le has contracted with them or someone else who has in turn
contracted with them.  If they didn't, they would be marked (correctly)
assh*les, and nobody would contract with them anymore, and they'd get
real poor real fast.
