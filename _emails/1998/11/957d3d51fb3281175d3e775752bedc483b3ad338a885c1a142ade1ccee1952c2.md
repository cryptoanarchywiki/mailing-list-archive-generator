I think that the original news release was likely a hoax. It even
said something to the effect that "this may be fiction" in the last
paragraph. Too bad no one actually pays attention and reads whole
articles.

``The South to the Future World Wide Wire Service is a weekly feed of
technology and media news commentary and satire published by the San
Francisco Bay Guardian. Quotations attributed to public figures who
are satirized are often true, but sometimes invented. Some fictional
statements may, in fact, be true. Any other use of real names is
accidental and coincidental. Editorial questions may be sent to John
Paczkowski. '
