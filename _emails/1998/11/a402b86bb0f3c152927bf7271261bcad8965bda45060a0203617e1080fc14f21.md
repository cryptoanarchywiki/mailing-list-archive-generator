>    Encryption Advance For Secure Global Communications 
>    Scientists at the Department of Energy's Los Alamos National
>    Laboratory have achieved a significant advance in demonstrating the
>    viability of an unbreakable encryption scheme for transmitting secure

>    Mathematicians Prove That Group Decisions Can Be Impossible To Predict
>    For several years, some political scientists and others have argued
>    that group decisions such as elections are impossible to
>    anticipate-even if the preferences of the voters are well established
>    and the decision-making rules are set. Now there's a mathematical
>    proof to back that proposition.

>    Chaos-Based System That "Evolves" Answers May Be Alternative To
>    Current Computers
>    A revolutionary new computing technique that uses a network of chaotic
>    elements to "evolve" its answers could provide an alternative to the
>    digital computing systems widely used today. Described for the first
>    time in the September 7 issue of Physical Review Letters this
>    "dynamics-based computation" may be well suited for optical computing
>    using ultra-fast chaotic lasers and computing with silicon/neural
>    tissue hybrid circuitry.
