How? Explain what part of Article V leaves this hole open. Explain the
relevance of the operational proceedures used during the transition from the
Articles to the current Constitution to the modification of the Constitution
itself within the bounds of its own structure? Congress wasn't even involved
in that original process because it didn't technicaly exist until after the
ratification. Why would a precedence involving state legislatures be found
to hold on a national legislature? There is also the issue that the
Constitution once duly implimented is the supreme law of the land and it
takes precedence over precedence.

This is apples and oranges.

Bottem line, if 3/4 of the states ratify there isn't anything that keeps it
from being law. The most that Congress can say is whether it's a direct vote
in the legislature or a vote by convention.

Which is relevant how?

That can't work if the resolution comes from the states. Only Congress has
the authority to decide that issue. So the only way a proposed amendment can
be placed up for debate and at the same time specify how it is to be voted
on at the state level is if it comes from Congress in the first place. A
proposal submitted by the states would force the debate of how it was to be
decided. Once that was settled it would be passed back to the appropriate
state legislature for direct vote or the initiation of a convention if
sufficient votes could be found.

I assume your speaking of the prohibition amendments again and their limits
(7 years I seem to remember).

That raises an interesting point. Suppose that the states submit an
amendment proposal, can Congress modify it? I'd say not because of the 10th.
If they could then the power of the states to submit amendments would be
moot.
