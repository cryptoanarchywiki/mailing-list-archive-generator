Jeff,

Alia has written that you sent CJ's teeth to him at the AZ
Correctional Corporation of America but he never got them
(nor stuff she sent). Guess that's an indication of the 
superior quality of gov-regged private-run jails -- or mails.

Thanks for the reminder that CJ inquiries got to go through 
gov-regged private-run attorneys who are ever in conference
and don't return calls.

John
