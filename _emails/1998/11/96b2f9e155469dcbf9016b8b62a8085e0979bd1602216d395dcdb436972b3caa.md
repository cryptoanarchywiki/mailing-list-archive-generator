	So you really think I'd shoot you over this discussion?

	Some "interpersonal disputes" diserve to be settled with a .357,
some with discussion.

	So this oversight group is less than a year old? Wait, see what
it's like in ten years.

	The cops often play judge and jury, and if you complain you have
parking tickets and tow bills the rest of the time you live in that city.

	If that is justice, then the system NEEDS dismantling.

	My wife shows up for every single jury summons she gets (I think
she gets them for both of us) she takes a book, wanders down (or up) to the
court house, and waits to be dismissed, since she is an educated white
middle class person, the lawyers have no use for her.

	It's the system.

	Because some of use prefer to live free.

"To sum up: The entire structure of antitrust statutes in this country is a
jumble of economic irrationality and ignorance. It is a product: (a) of a
gross misinterpretation of history, and (b) of rather nave, and certainly
unrealistic, economic theories." Alan Greenspan, "Anti-trust"
