I would question, sagely (IMHO), 

do not confuse the military budget- you know, the Military budget- with the
NSA portion of the military budget- last I heard they were getting about
1/3rd. Meanwhile, the lowly Military- Navy at least, is operating at 3 or 4
X the prior tempo with a significantly reduced portion of that military
budget.

Gee, is the current administration trying to reduce military infrastructure
by wearing it out- and not purchasing repair parts or replacements???

Or all the dollars going towards the DNA database, Echelon, and ???
