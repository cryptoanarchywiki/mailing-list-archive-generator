I only subscribed to this list a few weeks ago. I break my silence in
defense of Bernardo B. Terrado, who was viciously attacked by Adam Hupp and
then rather more graciously advised by Jim Gillogly.

Having read a significant amount of material on the ideological (rather than
the technical) background of cypherpunks (Tim May's writings, mainly) it
seems to me rather obvious that a relative newcomer to these circles would
come to expect to find people who may not be "mannered intellectuals", but
who are certainly not erstwhile defenders of intellectual property,
particularly asthe concept is applied to software today.

I understand that there may be other reasons why it is unwise to post
requests for warez on these lists, but moral outrage at the thought of
software piracy was not one I expected to read here.

Especially as I hear nobody complaining about the advertisement for
pornography that I receive every two days, regular as clockwork, from the
cypherpunks list, not to mention the great deal of other entirely useless,
automatically generated advertising.

Unlike most of you lucky people in the States, I pay through the nose for
on-line time.

Perhaps priorities could do with rethinking.
