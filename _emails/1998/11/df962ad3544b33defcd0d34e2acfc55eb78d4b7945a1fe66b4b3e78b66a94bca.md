	Really, you are saying they couldn't possibly recognize the
benefits of teaming up and co-locating fire stations, or that they wouldn't
sub-contract to a company that handled fires?

	This could still be more effcient than government.

	"reasonable" in cost? There is a LOT if inefficiency in the system
that competition could eliminate.

	Read that last bit. They got so carried away, that they spent
themselves out of existence.

	Governments just raise taxes, there is no penalty for ineffcientcy,
or lousy spelling.

	Ok, so you limit the senators and congressmen, then the unelected
beaureacrats have the power since they know the system and run the system.

	Well, coming from that subculture, and living in areas that allowed
me to observer others, I'd say bullshit.

	Wearing a painted leather jacket & ripped up blue jeans is NOT a
reason to get hauled off the street, searched and questioned.

	With a bunch thrown in at the federal level. Federal Matching Funds
& etc.

	Promote != provide.

	Promote does not mean "give away", it means "promote", do things
which incourage.

	They were the heads of the governments. The skills and abilities it
takes to get to that level insure that the people who get there have no
concern for those underneath them.

	There is no making up my mind. I never claimed the a government
could or should, rather I am claiming that it can't and won't, and to
expect it to be able to, much less willing to is foolish.

	So we agree that any government is doomed from the start, since
w/out people of honesty and integrity no system will work properly.

	No, that face that stares back from the mirror makes every effort
to be as honest and forthright as it can. It causes grief sometimes, but
it's the principle.

	That 1.7 million is the estimated people who have been killed this
century (170 million) in wars and murdered by governments divided by the
number of years in a century (100) which would give 1.7 million, or is my
math getting that bad?

	I don't see why I should limit my comments on the nature of
government to what I see in this country as there is a wealth of other
experience outside our borders.
