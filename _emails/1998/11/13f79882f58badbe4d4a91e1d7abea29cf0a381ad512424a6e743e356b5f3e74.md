Extensis Preflight Pro 2.1 answers all of your Preflight questions. 
Designed to save prepress professionals time and money, Preflight Pro
inspects your documents and corrects problems to ensure they are
error-free prior to printing.  

With an interface that mimics the traditional prepress workflow,
Preflight Pro provides you with a familiar environment to review files
prior to printing. Further, Preflight Pro now supports documents in all
the major graphics applications including Adobe PageMaker, Illustrator,
Photoshop, Acrobat, QuarkXPress, Macromedia FreeHand EPS, and Multi-Ad
Creator2.

What's New in Preflight Pro 2.1?  Now you can inspect Acrobat PDF files,
along with files from all the other major graphics applications.
Preflight Pro 2.1 now examines PDF files using more than 40 different
profile items, including document security settings, font subsetting and
embedding, downsampling rates and compression types.

Better yet, Preflight Pro also includes 5 free copies of Collect Pro
2.1. Give Collect Pro to any creative professional you work with to help
them correctly collect a job for hand-off to the prepress house. 
Collect Pro eliminates the problems of missing files (e.g.: fonts and
linked graphics) that can delay a job. 


Extensis Preflight Pro 2.1 will dramatically streamline your preflight
workflow, saving you time, headaches and money.
