AGENCIES GET NEW REPORT CARDS ON Y2K READINESS


Saying "the picture is a gloomy one," Congressman 
Stephen Horn, chair of the House subcommittee 
responsible for overseeing government progress on
averting the Y2K problem, has given out new report 
cards to federal agencies.  Three departments 
flunked:  Justice; Health & Human Services; and 
State.  The Defense Department gets a D-minus.  
Three departments get A grades:  Small Business 
Administration;  Social Security Administration;
and the National Science Foundation.  The Social 
Security Administration began working on the 
problem in 1989, eight years before most other 
government agencies.
