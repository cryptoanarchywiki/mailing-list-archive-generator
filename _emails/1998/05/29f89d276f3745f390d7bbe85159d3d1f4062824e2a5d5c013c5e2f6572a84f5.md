Chaum's "limited-traceability" patent includes other features
which directly counterbalance those of the Abstract accurately 
posted by Anonymous.  We've transcribed the initial sections of the
17-page patent which provide a fuller view of what his system 
offers:

   http://jya.com/chaum-lts.htm  

It's an interesting, nuanced proposal, from 1994, which helps
explain some of the strategy he's been keeping close to his 
chest until patent approval, and which may portend more 
provocative designs in the pipeline for outfoxing the keepers
of the chickens.
