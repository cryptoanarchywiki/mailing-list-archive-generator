It wouldn't make any sense. Why would a hacker use a military
site that is actively monitored to hack into a site with less security?

And why the requests to get the document originating from the same
source?

Also, from what I have read, the DoD needs come first in everything,
especially Defence Security related issues. No holds barred when they
want something.

This sounds exactly like the kind of information that they would 
want and consider essential, and could thus justify themselves to
get it by any means available. 

Of course, if this was a hacker playing tricks to the US military,
then I'm sure we can expect the military will publish this serious
a security breach, in order to get more money to protect themselves
against any Internet terrorist attacks in the future.

But I bet there will be no public comments or explanation given.
