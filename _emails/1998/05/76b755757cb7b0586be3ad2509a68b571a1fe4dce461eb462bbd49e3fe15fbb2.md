Hello,

Has anyone read "The McAlvany Intelligence Advisor" of Febuary 1998?

Title:
The millenium Bug: Global cyber-meltdown in the year 2000 PART 1

Mr McAlvany has a very domesday perspective.  Does his report have
alot of Truth or alot of Hype?

Please don't flame me to hard for my ignorance,  I'm just attempting
to seperate the CHAF from the WHEAT.

Thank you for any guidance
Brian
