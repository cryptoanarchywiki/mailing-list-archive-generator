Now explain how whining to have Gary Lee Burnore's entry removed from the
NC registered sex offenders website makes the underlying offense go away?
I'm sure the victim feels better, right?  And Gary's neighbors can now rest
easier knowing that the sex offender in their neighborhood is no longer
registered.

Sorry, but removing the entry does not alter the fact that Gary Lee Burnore
is still a convicted sex offender -- just an unregistered one.

I hate to tell you this, little Burnorian groupie, but you misspelled
"suck".  And who is this "we" you speak of?  The management of Page Planet?
What are you going to do?  Put on your white sheets and burn a cross on
my lawn?

It's people like you and Gary Burnore who threaten and harass people who
say things you don't like that make anonymous remailers necessary.
Otherwise only loudmouth bullies like you would have any freedom of speech.
Thank you for proving that point with your threatening post.
