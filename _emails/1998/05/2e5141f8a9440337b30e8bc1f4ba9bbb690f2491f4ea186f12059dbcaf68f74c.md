Not only that, it seems to be "spam" (the repetitive list type).  You see 2
days ago we welcomed a guest to my list (FreeGroup), and in his first batch,
guess what was there.  Another FreeGroupie had a great response to it, I
include it -

Bad *NEWS*???  This purports to be an item that's nearly 4 years old.  What's
the news?  I guess the news is that we're getting this 3rd hand--at a minimum,
with no idea if it's true or not.  But hey!  This is the internet.  So, again,
I ask, *NEWS*????

Bad beginning, Sir Will.  The willingness to pass along material of dubious
authenticity is not a good sign in my book. As Mr. Natural would say, "Check
your source."  So, what *IS* your source?

Thanks for your excellent research on the origins of that, Peter!
