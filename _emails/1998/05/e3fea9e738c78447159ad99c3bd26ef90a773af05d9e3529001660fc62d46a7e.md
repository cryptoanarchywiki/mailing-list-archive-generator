Excerpt from statement on introduction of S.2107, "Electronic
Commerce Enhancement Act," May 21, 1998 :

 The most important benefit of this legislation, however, lies in the
area of electronic innovation. Currently, digital encryption is in a
relatively undeveloped state. One reason for that is the lack of
opportunity for many individuals and companies to make use of the
technology. Another is the lack of a set industry standard. By allowing
use of this technology in the filling out of government paperwork, and
by establishing a standard for digital encryption, the federal
government can open the gates to quick, efficient development of this
technology, as well as its more application throughout the economy. The
benefits to American businesses as they struggle to establish paper-
free workplaces that will lower administrative costs, will be
significant, and will further spur our national economy.
