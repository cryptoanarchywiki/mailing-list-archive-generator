Consider the wonderful irony of hacking into some site and having the blame
go somewhere else.

Consider a somewhat different circumstance.  I was recently in Organ Pipe
Cactus National Monument.  The southern border of the monument runs across
the US/Mexico border.  One of the stops on the tourist drive around the
monument is a parking lot 40 feet from a broken gate in the fence that
marks the border.  There is a large sign there suggesting that people not
leave their cars because of recent breakins.  There was also broken auto
glass on the ground.

Now, if I were breaking into cars, I would pick that parking lot, rather
than others further north, in hopes that everyone would blame the Mexicans.
Don't think I am sure that the Mexicans are not responsible, just that I
see a chance for some US lowlifes to deflect the blame.

I see the same opportunity in using a hacked Navy computer to hack a marine
mammal site.  It may be the Navy, or it may be a hacker with a polished
sense of irony.
