Obviously, this is a forgery, it isn't me, my guess is, it's our 'nobody' -

<< Boy, do I feel like an idiot!!!
 
 I got my head out of my ass and checked out the headers on some
 of the messages coming from the list and discovered that many
 of them, including the one I am referring to above, are forgeries
 by Ulf Moller (who has those two 'eyes' over the 'o' in his name,
 just like the eye in the pyramid on the US dollar-bill, which 
 means he must be a Bavarian Illuminati shill).

 I would like to apologize to Tim, and to all of the other
 cypherpunks that I have offended by my stupid, ignorant posts
 and attitude on the list.
 I'm not really a CypherPunk. I don't even suck cock!
 (OK, I sucked my brother's cock a little, when I was younger,
  but that was just 'experimentation', OK? By the time I was
  nine, I had started fucking my little sister, so that *proves*
  I'm straight, eh?)
 
 Anyway, I don't think we should put up with this shit from Ulf
 (DoubleEye Illuminati) Moller. Let's all spam him.
