Sobolewski phoned last night.

Sobolewski gave me his opinion.

1  Campos is going to hold in camera ex parte conference with NSA
2  Campos will then award summary judgment to NSA.

I told Sobolewski that most of the legal citations in Campos' document
were not contained in the pleadings.

Sobolewski EXCLAIMED, "Oh."

Sobolewski is particularly good at law.  Sobolewski's father was a
lawyer and judge both in Poland and Australia.

Sobolewski prevailed in an lawsuit spanning the US and Australia - but
it still cost him more than $20k TELLING a lawyer what to do.

Sobowleski usually beats speeding tickets.

Sobolewski uses DISCOVERY to obtain maintenance and calibration
records of police radar.  And also radar operation training records of
the officer who stopped him.

The MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER authored by some government 
lawyers and signed by Campos is clearly a candidate for one of the
STUPIDEST and INCOMPETENT legal documents ever written.

Morales and I LOVE IT, of course!  

This is why we were so happy last Friday.  We got another shot at THEM
[aka The Great Satan].

Morales is taking the day off from Sandia today.  

We will finish and file our motion.  Then BLAST it out on the Infobahn.

I see other good legal advice linked at http://www.aci.net/kalliste/
