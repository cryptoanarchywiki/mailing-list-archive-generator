As some of you probably know, Robert Hettinga has been running a group
called the Digital Commerce Society of Boston for some time now.  DCSB
meets once a month for lunch at the Harvard Club in Boston to hear a
speaker and discuss the implications of rapidly emerging internet and
cryptographic technologies on finance and commerce -- "Digital
Commerce", in short.

Interest has been expressed in starting a similar organization here in
New York. I'm therefore pleased to announce the initial meeting of the
Digital Commerce Society of New York (DCS-NY). We intend to meet the
second Tuesday of each month for lunch, probably at the Harvard Club
in New York, and conduct meetings much like those of DCSB.

If you are interested in attending our first luncheon meeting, which
will be held on June 9th, or if you wish to be informed of future
meetings by e-mail please send an RSVP to "dcs-ny-rsvp@piermont.com"
We will send out an announcement in about another week informing
people of the final choice of venue and the cost for the lunch.


Perry
