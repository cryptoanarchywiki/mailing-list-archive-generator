!OB Crypto:

  I crossed the US border today to make a beer run, and a US Customs
officer who has known me for decades took the time and trouble to
'roust' me, as per the instructions of his superiors.
  The last words out of his mouth were a question to which he has long
known the answer: "Where were you born?"

  I was born in Liberal, Kansas.

  Could it possibly be that this fairly decent individual, who has
never done me serious dirt, even when it would have resulted in 
career advancement, is a Secret SypherPunk delivering a cryptic message
that could be translated as, "Toto...I don't think you're in Kansas,
anymore."?
