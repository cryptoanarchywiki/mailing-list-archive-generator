	Hi, all.

=>    "As a method to provide secure communications on the battlefield, we
=>    are pursuing research in the area of digital steganography," says
=>    Lisa Marvel, an electronics engineer at ARL's Information Science &
=>    Technology Directorate.

	Lisa Marvel presented the paper, "Reliable Blind Information
Hiding for Images" at the last Info Hiding Workshop (2nd annual) in April.
Coauthored with C. Boncelet, Jr. (U. Delaware) and C. Retter (Also 
from US ARM), the paper describes spread-spectrum techniques for hiding 
a good 1-5 Kilobytes in a 512x512 greyscale image securely and w/ error 
correction.  

	The proceedings aren't out yet, but one of the conference-goers
was kind enough to put electronic versions of the papers online.  See:

	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fapp2/ihw98/papers.html

	The ARM paper is in session 1.
