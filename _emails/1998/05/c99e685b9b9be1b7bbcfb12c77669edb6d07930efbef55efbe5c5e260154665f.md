I am perhaps even more ignorant, but I think that if you mix the same
kind of gunpowder (XYZ's BLAH # 123 gunpowder for example), then there
is no problem. But of course mixing different kinds may be asking for
trouble -- I have no clue about that.

Also, a gun owner could simply buy gnu powder in various places and
mix the batches.
