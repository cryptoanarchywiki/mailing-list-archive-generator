Just saw subject heading. "TOP SECRET (TS), Sensitive Compartmented
Information (SCI), CODEWORD" 

But jya.com did not respond.

I will buy a refrigerator magnet at the National Atomic Museum
in Albquerque

         1945 509th COMPOSITE GROUP 1995
           FIRST ATOMIC BOMBARDMENT
             50th ANNIVERSARY

for you and Masanori TOO.

For business reasons perhaps I should buy the whole bowl full.

This is so gross they have to be worth some MONEY, $US, YEN, SF, DM, 
Ringitt, etc.

Later
bill
