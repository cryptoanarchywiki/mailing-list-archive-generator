Yes, Chechnya is the model for the U.S. to follow: the Central Authority
attempting to crush a local rebellion by shelling cities, razing farms,
shooting suspected rebels without trials, and blockading entire provinces
to starve them into submission.

As the United States increasingly moves toward police state status and
chooses smaller nations to pick on (Panama, Somalia, Haiti, etc.), the
Armed Forces will come to resemble a domestic army. Something the Founders
were adamantly opposed to (between "no standing army" (ha!), Washington's
warning about avoiding foreign wars, and Posse Comitatus, which forbids a
domestic role for the Army).

Sounds good to me, attacking the Central Authority.

We need to launch our own crippling attacks on the U.S. military
infrastructure--it has become a cancer on the nation. Hacking their
computers and misdirecting Galaxy 4 were only the opening shots in this new
war.

Crypto is our strongest weapon. They know it. And they want it crippled.
