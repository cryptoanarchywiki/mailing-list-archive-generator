And spin the same propoganda wheel as the Man? Not me. I don't see crypto
gaining acceptance among the masses out of fear.

Look.. saying "Bad guys can use crypto to not get caught, and they can
use guns to kill people, so lets outlaw crypto and guns." Isn't an 
argument based on reason so much as it is fear. "Bad guys" strike fear
into the hearts of people, and they will do anything to protect
themselves, including shooting themselves in the foot. For every 
bad point that can be found for private ownership of firearms a postive
one can be found. The same goes for crypto. Guns can protect us from
criminals. Criminals can use guns to kill us. Crypto can protect us from
criminals. Criminals can use crypto to protect themselves. The list can
go on and on, and in the end it all will boil down to freedom on the
one hand, and some sick, distorted view of safety on the other.

Fear is more persuasive than rationality.

The people will gravitate to the side that suits them. Freedom is a damn
scary sight, so safety is embraced. If you want to save crypto (and guns
too, btw) talk about freedom and privacy first and crypto second.
It probably won't work though.. just like talking about freedom and
the right to self-defense didn't work with firearms.

As for me.. I don't give a damn how many laws are passed and what sort of
punishments are put into the books: I'll use crypto, get M^S mod N 
tatooed on my forehead, and still say whatever I like. And if "they" want
to talk over my position with me in Room 101, they can take the issue
up with the .45 that I'm not supposed to have.
