NYT this morning reports the that the Digital Millenium Copyright Act 
was adopted by the Senate Judiciary Committee:

"WASHINGTON - The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday adopted the 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which takes a new step toward 
protecting creative content in cyberspace by outlawing the equipment 
used to commit a copyright infringement, not just the act or intent of 
illegally copying material. 
...
Most visibly absent was any exemption for devices used in encryption
research, an issue Senate leaders said they hope to work out before the 
bill goes to the floor. "

There's been a good deal of discussion of this issue around here, to be 
sure. But I think maybe it bears repeating that even with some kind of 
narrow exemption for "encryption research", this bill is conveniently 
poised to be used not only against Evil Copyright Infringers, but also 
against the kind of troublemakers that expose, for instance, the 
deliberate weakening of GSM authentication.

Gawd. What bullshit.
