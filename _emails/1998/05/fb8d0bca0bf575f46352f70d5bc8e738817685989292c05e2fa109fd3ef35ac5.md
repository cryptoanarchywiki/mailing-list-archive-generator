who lives just down the street from us.

I asked her if the large edition being built on top of the
previous single-story home was going to be a studio.

She responded in American.  "Yah"

Occasionally I see some REALLY GOOD LOOKING women outside Hanks' home.

We REALLY should get this UNFORTUNATE MATTER settled before it gets
WORSE.

And it looks like it is getting WORSE.  http://www.jya.com/whp052898.htm
