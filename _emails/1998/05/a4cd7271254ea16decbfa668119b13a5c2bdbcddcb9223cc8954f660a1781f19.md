Learn how to be an informed investor and how a $1.00 realized 
gain in your
grain option value could return as much as $25,000 on a minimum 
investment
of $5,000.

Why Invest Now?


The 1982-1983 El Nino was the strongest of the century spreading 
drought,
floods and extreme weather across the vast stretches of the 
globe.  Total
combined losses to property and agriculture from weather related
catastrophes are estimated to have exceeded $10 billion.  The 
current El
Nino  has already surpassed the 1982-1983 event in magnitude and 
is expected
to have major impacts on world weather through the summer of 
1998.


How realistic is it that the grain option prices will move one 
dollar?


1982-1983 El NINO IMPACT ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS FUTURES PRICES

corn:        Nov. 1982-$2.165/bushel (low)      Aug. 1983-  
3.76/bushel
(high)     $1.59 increase

soybeans:    Oct. 1982 $5.18/ bushel  (low)     Sep. 1983-  
$9.60/ bushel
(high)    $4.42 increase


That's the past.  What does the future hold?


It remains to be seen if the 1997-1998 El Nino will duplicate the 
severe
weather conditions that affected agriculture production around 
the globe in
1982-1983.  However, given the historically tight supplies and 
record demand
for corn and sobeans repectively, combined with the strength of 
the current
El Nino event along with grain prices starting out from 
multi-year lows,  it
is our opinion that there is the potential for dramatic price 
increases in
the futures and options prices of agricultural products.
