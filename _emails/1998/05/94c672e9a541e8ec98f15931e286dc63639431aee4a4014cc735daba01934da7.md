Look, nobody (IMHO), I quoted another FreeGroupie.  Then I quoted YOU involved
in a 'red-herring' (unless someone forged your address) - "This qualifies as
an Official News Story Quote under the guidelines released by 'True Lies On
The InterNet Coommiittee' which was formed on Oct. 3, 1954."

Keep it up, Tim.
