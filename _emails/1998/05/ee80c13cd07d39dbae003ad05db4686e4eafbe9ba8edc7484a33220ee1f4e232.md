On the contrary, it has an elegance all it's own :-).
Since this idea has gone through several iterations, starting from Ron's original paper, I wanted to
summarize in one place Jesus Cea Avion's idea.  All credit for the following technique goes to him.

Alice does this:
Mreal = MAC(serial number, message bit, key)
Mfake = MAC(serial number, complement of message bit, key)
In english:  She MACs both the bit she means, and then MACs the bit she does NOT mean.  She then compares
the two MACs to find the first different bit.  Then she sends to Bob the bit from Mreal in the position of
difference.

When Bob gets the bit, he does this:
Ma = MAC(serial number, 0, key)
Mb = MAC(serial number, 1, key)
He then compares Ma to Mb and finds the first difference.  The bit in the position of difference is the one
that was sent to him by Alice.  He then knows whether Ma or Mb is correct.  If Ma is the correct one then
the plaintext bit is 0, if Mb is the correct one then the plaintext bit is 1.
Remember that there is no need to send the serial number, but you MUST use it in the MAC.  If you are using
a reliable protocol like TCP, or storing it in a file, the serial number is implied by the order it was
received/stored.

However clever this technique is (and it *is* clever), it defeats the original purpose of Ron's idea.  The
original reason Ron created chaffing and winnowing was to show that encryption laws are useless.  He
demonstrated that you can use authentication technologies to create privacy.  Even more, even if the
government demands that the plaintext be in the open, his original paper was set up to pass even that
egregious requirement.  Think of what the govenrnment would see with this latest chaffing and winnowing. 
Two people are send a bitstream that is unreadable without a secret key.  No plaintext is visible.  In
fact, it bears very little resemblance to the name "chaffing and winnowing."  It would not matter to them
wether you were using DES, IDEA, or C&W.  If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a
duck...
Another point of Ron's paper was that any technique the government tried to impose on C&W would create
unacceptable problems.  I dont think these problems would exist in this version of C&W.  Anyone know
better?
