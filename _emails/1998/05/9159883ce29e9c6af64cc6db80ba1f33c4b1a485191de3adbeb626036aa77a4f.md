BXA published yesterday its guidelines for getting approval
as a Key Recovery Agent:

   http://jya.com/bxa-kraguide.htm

The House Select Committee on Intelligence "has concluded 
that very large changes in the National Security Agency's culture 
and method of operations need to take place ... and that NSA 
will not meet its Unified Cryptologic Architecture (UCA) goals 
without tackling head-on some very fundamental internal 
obstacles."

Even so, as others earlier noted here, the Committee has
ruled out lifting encryption export controls.
