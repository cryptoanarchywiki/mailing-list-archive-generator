Hi 
I'm new to posting on this list (I've been checking it out for a while, 
really interesting stuff).

I'm a computer science student and therefore a newbie, but am interested 
in cryptography. 

I will be taking a UNIX course next year and plan to set up a UNIX drive 
on my PC.

I'm interested in getting some advice on which UNIX O/S would be good to 
set up. I'm currently aware of FreeBSD, OpenBSD, SCO UNIX, and LINUX. 
Suggestions and the reasons why would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, Gypsy
