PERL is horrendously less efficient, but easy to code for grunt work like
data processing and administrative scripts. PERL is THE BOMB for CGI web
programming, and combined with a nice free database with like mySQL, you
can produce some really amazing applications. I'd guess quite a few on the
list use PERL... I do, almost exclusively, but I'm making services and
doing sysadmin and not producing platform-specific applications. Then, C is
the most likely language used. Probably lots of people have their own
favorite languages. The O'Reilly and Associates 'Nutshell' books are widely
accepted as good reference manuals and tutorials in many lanugages. Certain
languages work better for certain applications. Check a technical bookstore.
