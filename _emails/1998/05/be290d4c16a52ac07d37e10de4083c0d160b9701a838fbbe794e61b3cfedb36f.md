And your legal basis for calling the posting of public information from a
public website to usenet "illegal usage" is ???  Presumably if the state
had wanted to keep the info secret, they wouldn't have made it public
available.

The only whining I've seen has been by Gary Burnore who complained that the
state of North Carolina failed to keep his conviction as a sex offender a
secret, and by various DataBasix sock puppets and groupies.

Burnore did the crime, he was convicted, he registered as a sex offender
with the state of NC, the information was made publicly available by the
state, and people found out as they were intended to.  Deal with it!

Maybe you ought to learn a little about remailers before you make such
ridiculous claims, McClatchie.  If I'm the person you say "whined", then
I'm *NOT* the same person who posted the information that Gary whined
about.  Sorry to burst Gary's bubble that all posts which poor little Gary
Burnore doesn't like originate from his one mythical "Anon Asshole <tm>".
In fact, the information is just as likely to have been posted anonymously
by YOU as by me.

Let me get this straight...  Someone threatens a remailer user with
physical violence, I comment on it, and now I'm "abusing a remailer" just
because you don't like what I have to say?  Don't you think that's for the
remailer operator to decide?  Do you operate a remailer, McClatchie?
