Greetings.

I've heard these two are going to come out one day soon.
What I'm interested in is what's so new in it that it's being called
version 6.0... Thanks in advance.

And my second message is about my archive. The reason why it hadn't
been updated to something worthwhile is the fact that i need to
spell-check the archives i download. There are tons of errors in them.
It's 
just too bad that people don't spell check their own documents on the
net.

Sincerely,
Jan
