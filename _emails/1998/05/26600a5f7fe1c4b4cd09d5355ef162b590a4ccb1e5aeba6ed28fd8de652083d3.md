                   LET'S ALL CELEBRATE SEINFELD!


   Friends, every so often that rare show comes along that captures 
the essence and feeling of the decade. The 70's had 'All In The 
Family'. The 80's had 'Cheers'. And the 90's gave us... 'Seinfeld'!

   Well, we're certainly going to miss Jerry, George, Kramer and 
Elaine, but we can *still* hang on to a little bit of them: To 
celebrate this classic show, we are proud to offer a very rare 
and very funny collection of never-before-seen outtakes and 
footage of Jerry and the gang!

   Some of these clips will definitely surprise you!


   This video comes in VHS format and is a full 81 minutes in length.

final episode! ***)
