But it _doesn't_ obliterate the plaintext channel;
it just obfuscates it a lot.

Depending on how sequence numbers are managed, it doesn't 
need to double it - if you try the MAC for 0, it either
succeeds or fails, and in either case you don't need to 
check the MAC for 1.  If you're using a shorter MAC which
might have collisions (e.g. 8 bits of a real MAC), you need to
check both, since both 0 and 1 could pass, trashing the bit,
and if you're using the "First different bit in MAC(0) and MAC(1)"
technique you obviously need to calculate both.

It's easy to demonstrate that the wheat channel is using real MACs -
if you're hauled into court for some violation or lawsuit,
you can probably be ordered to deliver the key (if you kept it),
since it's "not" being used to keep the message secret,
"only" to authenticate it.  

For the chaffing techniques that can use random chaff, though, 
you really can't prove that the "random" numbers are random 
as opposed to stegotext without giving up the stegotext
unless they're generated by a pseudo-random algorithm
which uses a key you can reproduce (as opposed to a 
session key from /dev/random.)

Will the real use of chaffing/winnowing be to send
uninteresting cover traffic and carry stegotext as chaff?
				Thanks!
