Clinton just had to announce Global Law while I was reading:
http://www.nebonet.com/headhome/dadmisc/trojan.htm

I suspect Clinton's speech in regard to nations co-operating in 
making their citizens subject to deportation to face charges in
foreign countries was designed to keep me from fleeing my 
'Dog At Large' charges in Bienfait.
Seiing as how the Queen's Gestapo was wearing Keblar when they
upped the ante for charge to four years in prison, I guess I must
be a desperate ASCII character.
