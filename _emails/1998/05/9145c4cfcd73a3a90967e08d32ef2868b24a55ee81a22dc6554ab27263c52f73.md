	I certainly defer to your expertise, as I have no particular
knowlage of radiation effects aside from reading an occasional technical
paper or article touching on the subject tangentially.   What I should
have said in any case is damage to  Flash EPROM or other electrically
programmed EPROM, as several people have pointed out that fuse and mask
programmed ROMs are not at all subject to single event radiation damage.
I suppose that  ROMs on board a satellite could easily afford to be
masked types, but of course there still are sound engineering reasons to
keep ROM'd code as minimal, simple and straighforward as possible, especially
when it cannot ever be changed and hundreds of millions of dollars of
satellite depends on it.
