COBOL would let you practice putting periods at the end of statements.  
Learn two things at once!

More seriously, code written in C, C++ and Perl is in demand.  There's a

it was written in a less mainstream language, and customers tend to 
appreciate that.  Out of those three, Perl is probably the best 
introductory language.
