I don't know the particular details of the "taggant" proposal (in terms of
which problem it's trying to solve). But here are some generally true
comments:

* For smokeless powders, i.e., _not_ black powder, the powders are
semi-visually recognizable. So Bullseye is noticeably different from Unique
and 2400, for example.

* However, smokeless powders are worthless for bombs. (Black powder is
almost worthless, by modern standards. Much easier to make your own
plastique.)

* If the goal  is to trace shootings, as oppose to bombings, then the focus
would be on smokeless powders. However, very few Bad Guys are into
reloading, so....

* The only way such a law can be useful is to crack down strongly on
ammunition resales, loans, gifts, etc. And a monstrous nightmare of
traceability, identity checks, etc.

(And what to do with those of us who have several cases (1000 rounds/case)
of various kinds of ammo? (I surmise dimbulbs like Diane Feinstein, Sarah
Brady, and Barbara Boxer think they can "outlaw" this old ammo, or cause a
gang banger in LA to shoot only freshly-purchased ammo.)

And so it goes.
