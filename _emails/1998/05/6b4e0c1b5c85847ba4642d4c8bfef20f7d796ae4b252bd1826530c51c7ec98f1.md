Perhaps you ought to reread your own header line, if you don't like what is
being posted:  "Aw, are you offended>".  Many remailer users utilize them
to avoid retaliation for hypersensitive netcops like you, Gary Burnore, and
Steve Crisp.

If everyone posted strictly politically correct content that wouldn't offend
anyone, there would be little need for anonymity.  But threatening to
"beat the living fuck out of" someone because he disagreed with what someone
posted is ample reason to withhold one's name and e-mail address.

If you don't like to read anonymous posts, please feel free to learn the
proper use of a killfile, McClatchie.  BTW, only one of us is using a
proper, RFC-compliant e-mail address in the From: line.
