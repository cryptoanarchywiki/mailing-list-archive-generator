CONSTITUTION FOR SALE
_____________________

1776 Constitution for sale. Inherited from original owner.
Hasn't been used for years, but can be easily restored to
its original condition by extermination of the rats which
have taken up residence under the hood and the removal of
useless accessories which were added by a long series of
unethical mechanics who saw the prospect of making more
money if it continually drifted to the right or the left 
than if the integrity of its original design was retained.
Truly must be seen to be appreciated.
Must be appreciated to be truly seen.
