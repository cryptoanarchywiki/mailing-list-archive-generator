>A helicopter was flying around above Seattle yesterday when
>an electrical malfunction disabled all of the aircraft's electronic

>drew a handwritten sign and held it in the helicopter's window. T
>he sign said "WHERE AM I ?" in large letters.

>People in the tall building quickly responded to the aircraft,
>drew a large sign and held it in a building window. Their sign said,
>"YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER.' The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his

>(Seattle/Tacoma) airport and landed safely.

>After they were on the ground, the co-pilot asked the pilot how
>the "YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER" sign helped determine their
>position. The pilot responded, "I knew that had to be the
>MICROSOFT building because they gave me a technically correct
>but completely useless answer."
