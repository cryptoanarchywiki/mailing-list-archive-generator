I agree on you opinion of the use of analogies, at large.  
The stigma is real (as in "happening") but it is nevertheless a load of bull
since it is the result of the population misconceptions, of being brainwasher by the apostles of 
political correctness.  

The quintessential aspects of guns in a free society is that they are Liberty's teeths.
Crypto is also the same, only after the teeths have been bashed in...

I argued this over the Canadian Firearms Digest list.
