I was recently asked to produce a drivers license in order to exchange a 
pair of long johns, paid for in cash. I asked why. "Store policy" was 
the reply. I asked why it was store policy, and the cashier responded 
with a hostile stare and exchanged the underwear for me.

Along the same lines, try refusing to give your zip code when asked at a 
register. Evidently some stores now simply cannot process a transaction 
without it. It's good for a laugh if you're bored. Borged?
