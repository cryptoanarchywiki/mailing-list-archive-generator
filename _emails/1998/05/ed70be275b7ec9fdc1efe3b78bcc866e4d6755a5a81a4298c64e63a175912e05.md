Declan,


Unfortunately it does not have a URL it is a printed report ( Febuary
1998), & I was given a copy of it.  One paragraph in the report ( that
I have read so far) does reference http://www.garynorth.com 

==========
NOTE:
Have not had the time to look at the Home Page for the report, but
could possibly be at http://www.mcalvany.com
===========

However, the report it self discusses all areas that the Y2K bug could
affect. The Only location, that I have found so far, is at the
subscription office  ( subscription is to high for me )
