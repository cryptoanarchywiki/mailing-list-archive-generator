If you are not getting traffic for FREE, the check out Sex Button;

http://www.sexbutton.com

The #1 way to generate fresh traffic to your site at no cost to yourself
when you use EXIT mode.  Unlike other programs Sex Button does not send all
*your* traffic to sponsors and click thru programs, it goes back to you.

 - Fresh traffic
 - More uniques
 - No sponsors
 - No banners
 - Traffic increase for free
 - Three different modes

Thanks for your time.
