Extremely fast. This extractor goes to major search engines (you can pick from a list of

keywords. It then spiders the web pages that come up as search results extracting the 
email addresses and saving them in a plain text format. You can define how deep the 
search is to be. You can filter out addresses such as those with webmaster or admin. 
You can use additional filters to have the software only include url's containing certain 
keywords. It can also eliminate certain url's with specified keywords. This makes for 
some very tight targeting. The cost of Hurricane is $295 but scroll down to see the 
package deal.

background allowing you to perform other tasks with your computer. The yield will 
vary according to the search keywords, your system, your Internet connectivity, net
