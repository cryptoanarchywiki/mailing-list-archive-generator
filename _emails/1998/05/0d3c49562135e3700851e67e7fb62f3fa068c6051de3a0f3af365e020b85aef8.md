Does anyone question the need for the ability to post anonymously with
censorious bullies like him running loose?  Him and Belinda Bryan
<eridani@databasix.com> threatening to "make life a living hell" for anyone
who dares to criticize her anonymously, that is.

Someone posts something he didn't like and he threatened that person with
bodily harm.  I criticize him anonymously for making that threat, and now
he threatens me, too.  That sure makes PagePlanet sound like a company I'd
like to do business with:
