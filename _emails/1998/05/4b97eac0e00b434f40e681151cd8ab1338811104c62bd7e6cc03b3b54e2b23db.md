This qualifies as an Official News Story Quote under the guidelines 
released by 'True Lies On The InterNet Coommiittee' which was formed
on Oct. 3, 1954.
To meet these guidelines, a quote must:
1. Be attributed to a species with the capacity for speech.
2. Be consistent with something 'everyone knows' the one quoted 'could 
have said'.
3. Be an attempt at misinformation which does not exceed the magnitude
of the average MainStream Press 'lean' on the Truth (TM).
4. Provide a means for those reading the quote to check the veracity
of the source and/or the accurateness of the quote, regardless of
whether or not the message headers are forged.
5. Not be from a 'cocksucker'.

If you check the CypherPunks archives, you will find that a Great
American and True CypherPunk with a humungous schlong once sent a
post to the list, titled, "Forgeries are your Friend."
Think about it...
