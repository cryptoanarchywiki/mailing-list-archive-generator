Here is a sample of a Market Alert.

Power Technology, Inc. Years Ahead of it's competitors
5/18/98 Market Alert

Power Technology PWTC (OTC: BB: PWTC) Time to start to accumulating. We have learned that the company is about to have a major event. Here is a brief description of the company.

Power Technology's (OTC BB:PWTC), principal offices and laboratory are located at 1000 West Bonanza Rd. Las Vegas, Nevada 89106.  The centrally located warehouse, laboratory, office structure, owned by Alvin Snaper, is a two-story 30,000 square foot building.  The Company utilities 5,000 square feet for the development and testing battery technology for electric automobiles and other uses.

Current technology in the automotive battery industry utilizes a 6 to12 volt battery system that employs standard electro-plates with lead-acid chemistries.  Power Technology has developed with already proven technology, a batter that substantially lighter than the conventional battery and also have a quicker re-charge rate and will be more cost effective. Because this new technology does not use lead, this product will be environmentally friendly.

The potential market for the new Power Technology battery could be any application that utilizes the conventional lead-acid technology. Also the current target market for Power Technology's battery will be the new environmentally friendly electric car.  Until recent amendments postponed legislation, the California Air Resources Board decreed that 2% of vehicles sold in California by major automakers must meet a zero-emissions vehicle standard by the year 1998.  By the year 2003, 10% of automakers sales mix in California must be electric. In addition clean-air-regulators in a dozen Northeastern states and Washington, DC are considering adopting the same air-quality standards as in California, which could result in an electric vehicle mandate covering roughly 40% of the US car and light-truck market.

The electric cars produce to-date have battery packs that last between 25,000 and 30,000 miles and require a two to three hour recharge using a 220-volt outlet or six to 10 ten hour recharge using a 110-volt outlet and cost about $2000 to $2,500 to replace. Still, these operating and recharge statistics only apply to electric cars or batteries operating at room temperature.  At higher temperatures, like those found on sun-soaked asphalt highways (approximately 50% of North America), battery life is drastically diminished.  Currently electric cars will carry two people about 50 miles on a hot day.  With this kind of performance the consumer will be very limited to where and how far they are able to drive.

The Battery that Power Technology has developed will let a consumer drive approximately 250 miles one a normal charge. The recharge time on a 110-volt outlet is approximately 3 hours. The Power Tech battery also does not contain any harmful materials.  

Two weeks ago I saw a prototype of the Battery and spoke to the inventor, Mr. Alan Snaper. The company currently has about $500.000 in the bank and is in discussions with several major companies and governmental agencies regarding this product. Currently Power Technology (OTC.BB) trades around 5 dollars a share.  The company just recently started to trade.  In my opinion Power Technology is undervalued. I believe this company will do very well in 1998. This is one of those undiscovered, overlooked companies on Wall Street. I really can't even project the potential of this company.  10 to 15 a share by the end of 1998 is extremely conservative.
Take a look at the management. The stock should be 10 just based on the management's resume. 

Management: Alvin A. Snaper, is the company's vice-president of development and the project coordinator for the new technology.  He has been engaged in scientific research and development of products and processes for 30 years. His well known inventions include the IBM Selectic Ball, Tang (the Orange drink), the NASA Apollo Photo-pack and a line of industrial hard coatings currently used by companies such as Gillette, Boeing, TRW, Vermont-American, Gulf Western and many others. Mr. Snapper currently holds 600 U.S. and foreign patents, products and processes. Mr. Snaper is the only inventor to receive the Design News Magazine Best Patent of the Year award for three separate years. In fact he is the only individual to receive more than one such citation.

Charles Warn is the Chief chemical engineer for the project.  He has over 40 years experience in development and project engineering and design expertise in a variety of different disciplines.  His past experience includes working with General Motors and Parker-Hannifin with high performance aircraft fuel systems.

Chances are that one of the big three automakers will buy out Power Technology.
Due to no exposure in the financial industry, Power is undiscovered and a screaming buy.
