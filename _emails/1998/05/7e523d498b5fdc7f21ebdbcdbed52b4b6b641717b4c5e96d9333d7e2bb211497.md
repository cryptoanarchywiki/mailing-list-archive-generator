The Virtual Girlfriend and Virtual Boyfriend are artificial intelligence 
programs for your IBM PC or compatible and also for MACINTOSH. You 
can watch them, talk to them, ask them questions, tell them secrets, and 
relate with them.  Watch them as you ask them to take off different clothes
and guide them through many different activities. Watch and participate in
the hottest sexual activities available on computer, including: several
sexual positions, using many unique toys, even bringing in multiple partners.
This is no doubt one of the most realistic, sexually stimulating computer
games available. They will remember your name, birthday, your likes and your
dislikes. Every time you start the program, they say different things, and
act differently. Each time, they have a different personality. With the VGA
digital graphics, The Virtual Girlfriend and Virtual Boyfriend software have
some of the hottest, sexiest graphics out there.  And with a Soundblaster or
compatible card, you can actually hear their voice as they talk to you. This
is the first adult software title that was designed for both heterosexual and
homosexual people. I would like you to try the actual full copy out before it
is put on the market.  It will be sold for 1/5 of the actual price ($10.00)
until I can get back some information on what people think of the program.  
Please give it a try and write back any comments.      Thank you.

    If you are interested and would like to order a copy, then you can read
the mailing instructions below.  It comes in an unmarked package and you are 
not put on any mailing lists whatsoever, guaranteed. It will run on any 386, 
486 or higher,  and 100% IBM compatibles.  Required is VGA graphics, and a 
hard drive.The sound card is optional. Macintosh requires at least 4 meg of 
ram.  
Virtual Girlfriend and Virtual Boyfriend are artificial intelligence
programs, meaning they are completely interactive. It would be just like if
you were talking to someone.  You can actually have simple conversations.  
Their attitudes change with the different things you say, so you can say
things that will upset them, and then say things that will please them. The
more you play/talk with them, the more you learn what they can do, and what 
they like to do. It really is a blast.  With all these movies coming out
about virtual reality, it's amazing to actually have a virtual reality
program like this for your own computer. It's easy to install, and
instructions are easy to follow.
