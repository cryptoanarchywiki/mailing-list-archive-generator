Hints that an anonymous poster is Tim may be red herrings. Given Stan's recent "research" into Xian conspiracy,
he may have other enemies than Tim...
[cypherpunk issue: how do you tell that anonymous posts aren't really anonymous?]

That said, I'm surprised at the number of "SPANK" emails directed at Stan. (Especially since they're from
anonymous accounts which he just said he has killfiled. Duh!)

I find some of his posts amusing, some edifying, some boring, but mostly not "clueless", unlike the following
cascade which I've paraphrased slightly:

some nobody said:
> another nobody said:
>> yet another nobody said:
>>> still more nobody said:
>>>> I think Stan is clueless
>>> Me Too.
>> Me Too!
> Me Too!!!
