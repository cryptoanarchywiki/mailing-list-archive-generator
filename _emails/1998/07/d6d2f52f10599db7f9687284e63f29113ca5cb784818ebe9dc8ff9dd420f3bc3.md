Are we talking long-term archival?  I'm more concerned about someone
grabbing communications in transit, storing them and throwing chips and
mathematicians at it.

If the government comes with the search warrant, then I should have already
deleted the file if I didn't want it available.  If someone wants to face
security guards or a gun by my bedside they can steal the archive.  It's
the same rules as always. (except the theif must also have the math and
chips).

In the case of archive you have the protection of physical security and in
most cases the knowledge of when it has been breached -- It's a lot
friendlier than in communications where who knows what is going on between
the sender and recipient.

OTP is a pain, and is not effective for archival -- but it is the only way
I've seen to protect communications in excess of ~30 years.
