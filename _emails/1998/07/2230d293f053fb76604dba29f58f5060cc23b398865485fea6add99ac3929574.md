A forwarded message from Jim Bell:

Jim is requesting that cpunks try to get the Oregon 
newspaper to write up another story on his case.

John Branton is the "crime reporter" for the Columbian 
newspaper (editors@columbian.com). Jim asks that people 
send Branton a note saying they would like to see a 
story on the issue of Jim's being spied on.  This reporter 
already knows what the allegations are, but Jim wants
to prod him into covering his story, because he thinks 
it's important enough for the public to know about it.

Jim also would like any reporters on the list who are 
interested in talking to him, to send him their phone 
number and he will give them a call.

BTW, the next hearing date is set for the 7/30/98.  In 
the meantime, he's hanging around shooting pool, reading 
magazines, etc.
