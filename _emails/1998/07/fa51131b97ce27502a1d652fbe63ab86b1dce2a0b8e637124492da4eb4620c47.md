 The Secret Service When They Visit
 _____________________________
SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY DRUGS!!!

10.  You're here about the VOICES, aren't you?
    They *told* me you were coming...

9. Look, pal, I don't even know who the President *was*...
  I mean...*is*...
  Uuhhh...is it 10:15 in DC yet?

8. Do either of you guys know where the 'yellow' wire goes?

7. The First Lady's butt looks pretty good through a 'scope', eh?

6. You must have me confused with my brother, MadDog...the *good* son...

5. Could you put this around my forearm, give it a twist, and then pull
   it really tight?
   Hey, don't bump the spoon!

4. *Which* death threat? Unless you're going to be more specific,
   you're just wasting my time and yours.

3. 'One Bullet, One Vote' bumperstickers are meant as *humor*?
   You're schitting me, right?

2. Next time you're guarding the President at a White House speech,
   do you think you could stand just a tad further to the left?

1. "Cuckoo-Cuckoo"
