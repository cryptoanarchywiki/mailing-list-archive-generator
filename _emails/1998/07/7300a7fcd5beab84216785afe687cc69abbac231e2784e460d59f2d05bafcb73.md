Sure, no problem. Just send fifty bucks per plate, money orders only 
(do not fill in the "pay to the order of" part) to me, Sammy, at:

Oregon State Penitentiary
2004 Coastal Hwy.
Portland, Oregon 89002
Attn: Sammy Polinski A 44E52J (Block 9)

That's $50.00 per address/plate, no questions asked. Nice doin business withdya.
