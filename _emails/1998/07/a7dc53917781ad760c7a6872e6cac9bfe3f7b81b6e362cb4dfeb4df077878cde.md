I still have a few of those shirts left (I ate the cost ... along with a
few copies of Secret Power).

If anyone wants to do this, I will be happy to donate the T-shirt (and
be an "arms" supplier).

In fact, one of the people who expressed an interest in buying the
T-shirt wanted to send one to Dave Letterman (Letterman was hot at the
time).  Did you ever do it?

	Greetings,

		There are t-shirts out there with both human readable
and
	machine readable (bar code) versions of the RSA in 3 code....
Wear it
	when boarding an international flight....  They even state that
they
	are a munition and ITAR controlled in BIG letters on the back...


		Chris
