Pretty much. Actually, the model I like is one where transactions on the
net are free, but putting money *on* the net costs some smidge of money,
just like buying traveller's checks cost money, something like one or two
percent, I think.

You can't get any network effects, oddly enough, if you charge to take it
*off* the net, because merchants have to *pay* to participate. It would be
as if you had to pay to redeem a traveller's check. If that were the case
nobody would accept them. Pretty serious seignorage loss that would cause.
:-).

Again, I've a white paper on this. If anyone's interested, I'll send it to
them offline.  And, again, the dbs list folks have already seen it. :-).

Speaking of gratuitous plugs ;-), there are only two more days until I
close the subscription book on the symposium, and I still have some room.
See <http://www.philodox.com/symposiuminfo.html> and register now, if you
want to go.

Cheers,
Bob
