DoD released today a July 21 speech by John Hamre to a
gathering of Fortune 500 CIOs of which about half dealt
with infosec and encryption issues:

   http://jya.com/dod072198.htm  (53K)

Mentioned: the EFF DES crack, PGP, offshore products, 
the need for expensive hardware to bolster cheap code,
Eligible Receiver, the difficulty of DoD meshing its legacy
decrepit systems with cutting edge warfighting technology, 
concern about foreign Y2K, the need to slaughter when no 
one volunteers to help.

DoD boosts strong encryption as the primary means to
protect mil and com info but insists on "balancing"
the needs of privacy and law enforcement. Questioners
bluntly challenged equating the two.
