It's the easy way out (and I mean DOWN and OUT)!  I mean, if we're simply
going to change them out everytime, why bother to figure out which ones aren't
evil/stupid (I mean, out of all those politicians, there's got to be 1 or 2!
I think. ;-) )?

See, if we just simply change politicians at every chance, then we throw the
baby out with the bathwater, so to speak.  The simple solutions aren't always
the best ones.
