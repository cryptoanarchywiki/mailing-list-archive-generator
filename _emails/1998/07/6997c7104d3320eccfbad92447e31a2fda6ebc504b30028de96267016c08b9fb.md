The US Government sets aside Billions of dollars each year in
the form  of grants and loans for entrepreneurs and the American
public. Your tax  dollars are not all spent by the Defense Department.
A large percentage  of your tax dollars are set up for domestic
assistance to help individuals, entrepreneurs and businesses create 
jobs whether the company is large or small. Steven Jobs received 
government help with his company Apple Computers, Donald Trump,
Ross Perot , Lee Iaccoca are just to name  a few of the individuals
who used this program to start billion dollar  corporations.
Each year the government gives out hundreds of millions of dollars
to  companies,individuals and entrepreneurs, homemakers and the likes.
Currently, less than 2% of the population applies for grants and 
loans  while a large percentage around 4 Billion remains unclaimed
when it  could help an entrepreneur, company or someone in need. 
Most Americans  do not know these programs exist for their benefit.
The government wants  you to succeed in hopes of stimulating the 
economy. Take a look at some  of the programs available.
Direct Grants to $800,000 Direct Loans to $2,200,000. Over 300 grants 
for business and loans that are easier to obtain than conventional 
loans. All grants and some loans require no credit check and no  
collateral because you are actually borrowing your tax dollars set
aside  for business start-up and development. You live in the 
greatest country  in the world "Only in America" You hear the term 
spoken but without  comprehension. More immigrants call for assistance
than US citizen,s  they see the opportunity and if not first successful
they try back when  they become citizen,s. Are they successful? 
Eventually.
The government means business ,to help you they have hired over 
1500  professionals to help you if only you would call. The area
of expertise  falls under marketing, consultation,import,export
and anything  pertaining to business that might help you succeed.
This could mean the  difference in success or failure of your 
business. The business endeavor  does not matter the government 
has the money and an expert to help you  whether you are in farming,
real estate, retail,daycare or any legal  money making opportunity.
