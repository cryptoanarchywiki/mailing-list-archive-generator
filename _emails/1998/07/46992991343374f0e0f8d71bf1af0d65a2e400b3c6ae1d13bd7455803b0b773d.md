I have a question.
I have been using PGP since version 2.  I recently picked up the shareware
version of PGP 5.0/5.5.5
I have both.  I was wondering how secure DSS is?  Also, I was interested in
knowing if the RSA encrytion method used in 5.0 or 5.5.5 is in anyway
different from say version 2.6.3   Is it looser, more penetrable?  How
vulnerable are these versions compared to the older versions?

Thanks in advacne for your time and cosideration.

Life, Liberty, Property,

-Ric

"The government has no source of revenue, except the taxes paid by the
producers.  To free itself -for a while- from the limits set by reality,
the government initiates a credit con game on a scale which the private
manipulator could not dream of.  It borrows money from you today, which is
to be repaid with money it will borrow from you day after tomorrow, and so
on.  This is known as "deficit financing."  It is made possible by the fact
that the government cuts the connection between goods and money.  It issues
paper money, which is used as a claim check on actually existing goods-but
that money is not backed by any goods, it is not backed by gold, it is
backed by nothing.  It is a promissory note issued to you in exchange for
your goods, to be paid by you (in the form of taxes) out of your future
production." -Ayn Rand
