I will fax the two sheets from the clerk to you later this afternoon.

Morales and I will try to meet on his way home from work
to get his signature.

will likely cause MUCH MORE UNPLEASANTNESS .. for clerks and judges.

Let's hope this matter is promptly settled before it gets WORSE.

Later
bill
