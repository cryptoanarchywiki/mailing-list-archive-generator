Paul may be a kook to some, but he has the courage to stand against 
the forces who wish to take all our liberties --or should I say, those
few we have been permitted to keep.

Is it only a coincidence that the Social Security Admistration published 
the new requirements for the national ID in Section 666 of the code?

   "...and I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat 
on him was Death, and Hell followed with him." [RV 6-8]

   "and he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,
to receive a markin  their right hand, or in their foreheads; [Rv13-16]
   "and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the 
name of the beast, or the number of his name; [Rv13-17]
   "Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of 
the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six Hundred 
threescore and six" [Rv13-18]

    OK, Mitch, it says it all in Revelation --and it is happening. See
    the article on defending yourself from Federal conspiracy charges
    which was posted to the list a few minutes ago by anonymous.

    I always define conspiracy as three guys getting drunk at a bar
    while discussing the idea of robbing the bank across the street.
    one passes out and the other two go across the street and attempt
    to rob the bank; all three are tried and convicted: two for robbing
    the bank; and three for conspiracy to rob the bank.

    so, be careful who you associate with; in Turkey you just might get
    rolled over....

	attila out...   one more time.
