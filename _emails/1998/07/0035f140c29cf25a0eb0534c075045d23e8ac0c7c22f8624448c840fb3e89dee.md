My declaration for the Junger lawsuit (available on jya.com) touched
on these issues, but the court chose not to accept my reasoning. My
quick reading of the decision is that the court took note that sourc
and object code are functional (they control a computer), and chose
to ignore their ability to express an algorithm and, hence, to
communicate
the substance of an encryption algorithm to another human being.

The court also appears to assume that, because computer source code
requires
technical skill and training understand, it somehow loses its First
Amendment privileges: this I find confusing.
