Or by one of the weaselly marketers in a while.

Think of it.
You creat a site based on a recent headline making Internet first <the
women who had a child online>.
Then you spam the shit out of everyone faking like your the oposition.
You don't get nailed for spamming
you give your opisition a black eye
you artificially create a media blitz, since the news runs to cover this
confrontation between the relegious right and the new internet morality.

You get about a billion hits
you add one or two click through adds
or some other such thing to the web page

Here comes the big day

Bingo, a quick 30,000$ in your bank account.

You sell the rights to porn companies to include in their feeds
since there is so much product recognition.

;)

smart little bastard
not that I am saying that is what is going on.


not that im cynical or anything....
