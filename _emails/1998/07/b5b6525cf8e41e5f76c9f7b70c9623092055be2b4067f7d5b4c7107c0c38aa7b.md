I will send by snail mail a copy of July 6, 1998 FOIA request
951102002 response from Herbert Richardson for

  	all investigative report authored at DOE in to my allegations
  	that NSA willfully and knowingly attempted to sabotage DOE/
	Sandia cryptographic projects.

plus enclosures.

I will phone later for your input on what I should do for further
action.  Other than appeal, of course.

Some at Sandia got into a crypto battle with NSA.

Let's all hope for settlement before matters get WORSE.

And matters are GETTING WORSE. http://www.jya.com/whp071598.htm
