There are three files with the netnanny, called d32l.dll,
n32l.dll, and p32l.dll.                                    
These are not really dlls, but are almost certainly the
database of words and phrases that the netnanny is interested
in.

If you look at these files, there is a total of 1037 lines,
each of which has from 10 or so to 60 or so characters.
It turns out (see below) that two characters in the data file
almost certainly map to 1 character of the plaintext, so
the phrases are 5 to 30 characters long.  1037 phrases of
5 to 30 characters seems about right.

If you look closely at the text, you'll see that they letters
alternate between the ranges of 32-63 and 96-127 (decimal).
That is, a line begins "1{7}.f#f".  The 1, 7, ., and #
are all in the range 32-63, and the {, }, f, and f are in the
range 96-127.  Each of these letters, then, can take one of
32 values, or five bits.  If you combine these, you find that
there are only 512 combinations used of the pairs of letters,
instead of the expected 1024 (=2^10).  It turns out that if
you construct a 10 bit word with the first 5 bits from the
first character and the second 5 from the second character,
then you find that the middle two bits are always either both 
0 or both 1.  So, there are 512 possibilities.

These 512 numbers are fairly uniformly distributed, so this is
not a simple substitution cipher.  Interestingly, though, again,
using the above construction of a 10 bit number from the two five
bit pairs, you find that the high order bits change very slowly
if at all from character to character. This is the beginning of
d32l.dll (fair use quotation of two lines from the file)

Note that the middle two bits are always the same, and the high
order bits seem to be changing slowly, but slowly upwards.

My guess is that some value is being added to the plaintext character,
and this value is incremented every plaintext character.  Further,
perhaps, there is a exclusive or being performed.  In any case, I hope
that this gets other people moving in the right direction.  
Suggested words to look for, that seem to have tweaked the nanny, are
xenu hemet zinjifar helena kobrin mark ingber grady ward mirele
rnewman wollersheim andreas heldal-lund operation clambake
"gilman hot springs" motherfucker cocksucker
