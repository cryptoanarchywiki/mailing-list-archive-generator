I am trying to find my brother, "Allen Thomas Taylor" I am not sure what year
he was born but I think it was l922, l923.  We have the same Father, "Alva
Thomas Taylor", my name is Christine (Taylor) Ernest, I was born l935, in Mt.
Vernon, Mo..  I have not seen my brother in 60yrs.  The last I heard he was
working for the civil service in Washington, DC, and got married in Maryland.
Any information I would appreciate.

Thank you
Sincerely
Christine Ernest
