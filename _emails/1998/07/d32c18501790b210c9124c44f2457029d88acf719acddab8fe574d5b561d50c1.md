Someone assuming the personality of attila about yesterday (who is he 
today? ask him--you might like the answer) wrote while in a mental state 
that could be characterized as perceiving reality for only the very 
briefest of moments:

[humongous snip of recycled rumors, shameless fabrications, hypocritical 
innuendo, outright slander, and maybe a paucity of conceded-by-all-
including-the-man-himself historical fact]

So learn to play the game.  Yeah, no one, even the icons we build, is a 
born angel.  There are relative levels of the good and bad in our society. 
Do you see the word "relative"?  It means no absolutes.  If you want 
absolutes, check out the Bible readers for whom every word is sacred.  One 
of my rotating tag lines talks (another Turkish proverb) addresses the 
very issue you bring up:  power.  I hope it shows up at the end of this 
message.

Well, that's what we call human history.  Nations and empires rise and 
fall, birth and death, a natural progression.  The only thing you need 
worry about while living in this kennel called the planet Earth is to be 
top dog.

You're sure about that, are you?
