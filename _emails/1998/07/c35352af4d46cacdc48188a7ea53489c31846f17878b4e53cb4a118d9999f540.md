Jim would like to thank those of you who have sent him
hidden files, as he requested.
However, he would appreciate it if you clueless fucks
would send the hidden files in *cakes*, not in floppy
disks.
[I told him it was a mistake to post to the Cypherpunks
AOL Distributed Node.]

Nobody Juno, eh?
