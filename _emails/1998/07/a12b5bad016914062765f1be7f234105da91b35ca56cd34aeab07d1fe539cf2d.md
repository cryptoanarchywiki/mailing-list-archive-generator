Dear Cypherpunks:

I write for the New York Times Magazine. My editor 
wants to profile, as he put it, "a group of hackers 
who've gone legit" and now do consulting for 
corporations. Paul Kocher of Cryptography Research 
thought you guys might have a couple suggestions. He
mentioned a co-op in Boston, but couldn't recall their
name. Also -- anyone know what Robert Morris Jr. is up
to? Or how to contact him? 

Thanks very much.

Mary Roach
