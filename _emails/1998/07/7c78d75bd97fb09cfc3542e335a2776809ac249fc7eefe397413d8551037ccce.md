By the same reasoning as in my posting:

Thus, your instructions to bring together those two one-pound pieces
would be your right to free speech -- maybe it is poetry -- as long
as that is not recognized as a federal crime! After it boooms the
first time... it is a device, and it is immediately recognized to be
an unlawful one.

I could not find that quote -- "more functional".

BTW, I think that Gwin was struggling to express the notion that
source code (syntax) is a device whenever there is a clear binding
between that source code and known semantics, together with proper
pragmatics (the enviroment, as defined in semiotics), in order to
perform the desired function. 

This is called a Just In-Iime Compiler ... and Gwin is 100% right
when he affirms that the difference between source code and compiled
code is null regarding its effects -- its desired function. 

Thus, if the device is unlawful then it must be unlawful both as a
source code and as a compiled code.
