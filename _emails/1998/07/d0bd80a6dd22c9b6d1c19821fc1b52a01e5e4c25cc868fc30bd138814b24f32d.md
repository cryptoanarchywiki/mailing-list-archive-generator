But what about the child of the rich that got just a little less rich for 
making the unrich richer and by being unrich, cannot make or affort the 
latest "save the world gizmo" who would have made us all more richer?

"The government has no source of revenue, except the taxes paid by the producers.  To free itself -for a while- from the limits set by reality, the government initiates a credit con game on a scale which the private manipulator could not dream of.  It borrows money from you today, which is to be repaid with money it will borrow from you day after tomorrow, and so on.  This is known as "deficit financing."  It is made possible by the fact that the government cuts the connection between goods and money.  It issues paper money, which is used as a claim check on actually existing goods-but that money is not backed by any goods, it is not backed by gold, it is backed by nothing.  It is a promissory note issued to you in exchange for your goods, to be paid by you (in the form of taxes) out of your future production."
