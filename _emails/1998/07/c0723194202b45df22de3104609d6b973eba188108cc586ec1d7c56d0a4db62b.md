ROFLOL!  What's coincidental?  The latest tune that my band, Nobody's Business
(in which I play bass and sing) has learned, is Cheap Sunglasses by ZZ Top.
If it ain't coinicidence, I got a 'scarecrow' in my band.

Someone tell me if it's good or bad to be in the 'Space Aliens Hide My Drugs'
series.  ;-)
