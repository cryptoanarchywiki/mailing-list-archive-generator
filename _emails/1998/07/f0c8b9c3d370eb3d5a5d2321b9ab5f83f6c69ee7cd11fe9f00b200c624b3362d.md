	This is an interesting claim.  Surely it's only been
	in this century that law enforcement has ever had 
	the kind of systematic access to communication that presently
	does.  I'd say Louis Freeh is lacking in the history department
	if he really believes that Americans have never possessed
	as much privacy as strong crypto offers.

	I'd also say he's missed a few history classes if he 
	thinks that the world will blow up without him listening
	in.
