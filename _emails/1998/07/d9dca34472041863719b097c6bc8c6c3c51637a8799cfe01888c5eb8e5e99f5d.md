Hi Cypherpunks.
I fell on that text in the Canadian Firearms Digest, V2 #506 today.
Maybe somebody will want to look into it to see what part of ITAR was modified and if it will affect crypto...

Please feel free to forward to every possibly interested party.

Ciao

Subject: US Export controls saga update

(http://www.pmdtc.org/oas.PDF)  indicates that US State Dept. expects
the current exemption of Canada from the ITAR export permit
requirements for firearms and ammunition (and parts thereof)
to be rescinded soon.

When I spoke to a US State Department employee, they indicated they
were being told it is going to happen in a few days.

They gave me a Canadian government employee counterpart contact
information (?Dept of Foreign Affairs?).

I spoke with the Canadian government contact, and was pleasantly
surprised for a change.

I was told that Canada plans to contest this threatened action, since
in part it could have wider trade implications outside the firearms
and ammunition realm.  This is certainly refreshing, since on the
whole the current Canadian administration has generally leapt at any
chance to put it to the Canadian firearms community.

My contact expressed the belief that a change in Canada's ITAR permit
exemption status by the United States cannot be accomplished solely by
Executive branch action, but must be cleared thru the Legislative
branch (Congress) too.  If that is indeed the case, it is much less
certain of approval, since the anti-gunners may control the US
Executive branch, but they don't control US Congress at this time.
