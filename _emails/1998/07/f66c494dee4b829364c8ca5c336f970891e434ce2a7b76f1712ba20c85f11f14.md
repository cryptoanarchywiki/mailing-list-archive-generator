Dear One Nation supporter in NSW,

Pauline Hanson has been banned from using council facilities in her
electorate of Blair.

The Labor-dominated Ipswich City Council, the heart of Pauline Hanson's seat
of Blair, has returned to their old politically motivated tricks against the
One Nation party.

With the recent Queensland State Election turning the mainstream parties on
their heads the word has gone out - do anything that you can to deny One
Nation their right to a "fair go".

The Council allowed One Nation to use their facilities after a 6 month long
ban following the breaking of a council hall window at the party's launch by
protesters in April 1997. The ban was imposed on the basis of "protecting
council staff from danger".

An example of recent (1998) pre-state election use by Pauline Hanson of the
Ipswich City Council facilities can be seen at:

http://www.gwb.com.au/onenation/qldstate/polaunch/index.htm

at the above link Pauline Hanson launched One Nation's state policies
without any security problems or risk to council staff.

One Nation used Ipswich City Council facilities on several occasions this
year without any protesters even making an appearance.

The basis of "fair go" and "freedom of assembly" is equity in decision making. 

At a recent Labor Party meeting One Nation members demonstrated peacefully
outside the council venue yet no such threat or withholding of council
facilities to Labor has been suggested - nor should it.

Following the State Election the rules have apparently changed.

The Ipswich City Council this week rejected an application by Pauline
Hanson's One Nation to use council facilities on the basis of "concern for
the safety of staff".
The mayor of Ipswich, John Nugent, was one of those voting against One
Nation's use of council facilities.

This is laughable as the last time protesters appeared at a One Nation
meeting was over a year ago in June 1997.

One Nation has (to ensure council staff safety) offered to supply private
security and ensure that sufficient police are on standby - this offer has
been rejected.

The link below will take you to an image of one of the chief protagonists,
Councillor Paul Tully, a Labor supporter who has made it his life ambition
to destroy what Pauline Hanson and you stand for.

Can we let him win?

I don't think so.

I appeal to you to write, in the strongest terms possible, to the local
Ipswich paper, The Queensland Times.

Their email address is:

qt@gil.com.au

Remember to keep your letter to under 200 words to ensure publication.

Issues to look at:
==================

1) The damage to Ipswich's reputation through these undemocratic antics.
2) Freedom of speech.
3) Labor's underlying undemocratic motives.
4) What role the ratepayers who voted Hanson have been allowed in on this
decision by the Labor council?

I encourage you to send the Queensland Times an email letting them know how
YOU FEEL about the Ipswich City Council's decision to prevent Pauline Hanson
from using ratepayer's facilities.

GWB
