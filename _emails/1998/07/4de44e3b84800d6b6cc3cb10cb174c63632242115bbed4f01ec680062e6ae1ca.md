Gwin has written a phrase which deserves more analysis, IMO -- free
from political overtones if we want to be impartial. The phrase can
be reworded as:

  "source code is a device, that actually does a function"

The difference and importance here is between syntatic and semantics. 

Your 4-instruction source code above is not a device today -- it
cannot perform any function. It has only syntatics, not the "how to". 
But, if there were a machine that could supply the proper semantics
(ie, actually perform the functions 1-4) then your source code above
would be a device.  Further, your source code may not be a device
today but be a device tomorrow.

As another example, bringing together one pound of inert metal with
another one pound of the same inert metal was not considered to be
explosive -- until U235 was used for the inert metal and properly
compressed. The difference is semantic, not syntatic. 

In that, Gwin is correct. Can the source code actually perform a
function?  Then, it is a device. Irrespective of the needed platform,
in the same way that an electric shaver is a device irrespective of
the local availablity of an appropriate power outlet.

IMO, even though I consider Gwin to be correct to a very large
extent, widespread use of crypto will not come from lifiting such
bans ... but from real need -- which does not outweigh the hassle,
today. The EFF has a wrong target there. 

Do you know how much Internet e-mail traffic is encrypted today?  Can
you believe less than 10%? Notwithstanding the rethoric exercises and
limelight it may provide, talking about encryption export bans may
not be as effective as desigining better and easier uses of strong
crypto -- that can then really drive market, legislation and courts. 

Need to use is a better key than need to know, it seems.

Cheers,

Ed Gerck
