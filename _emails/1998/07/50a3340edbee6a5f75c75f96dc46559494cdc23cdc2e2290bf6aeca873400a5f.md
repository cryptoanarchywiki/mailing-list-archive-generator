Hello:
 My name is Enisa, I'm 13 years old. I write an online e-zine that for teens.
We have over 150+ members. We just started a few days ago. We are looking for
sponsors to sponsor our contests. These are some of the things we are able to
do for you...
 * A banner on our page
 * Repeated mentioning in our newsletters
 * And anything else that you would like
 These are the things I would like in return:
 *2-3 prizes for our contest
 And nothing more.
 If you are interested please e-mail me
so we can discuss this further.
Please respond.
 Thank you for your time. 
 Sincerely, 
 Enisa
