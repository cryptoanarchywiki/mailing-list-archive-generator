Nice to talk to you last night.

I am concerned too about what may happen. http://caq.com/cryptogate

So was Hans Buehler.  He phoned me from Zurich to discuss
his concerns several years ago.

Getting things settled is up to congress.  

Rep McKinney and Sen Grassley are the contact points.  Both got
copies of the Swiss Radio International tapes.

Buehler, later, on the phone seemed resigned to what may happen.

Nothing he can do about it.

But there is something congress can do about it.

GET IT SETTLED!
