	you are absolutely correct --my gaffe. CIA has never worked code

	mathematician on the Verona project just died, did he not?

	I believe he went on to Moscow since he was one of FDR's two or
	three top people. I would need to reread the rather long paper
	on the various people involved and just how close McCarthy was
	to a truth he could not prove --didn't make McCarthy any less of a
	scumbag, though. I read the Alger Hiss portions of the documen-
	tation rather carefully because of the personal friendship I had
	with Tony who was a very genuine, refined individual (we were
  	on the Harvard Crimson editorial staff together). I will also
	check your reference on Verona, but I believe there is more in
	the open records which ties it down.

	what is interesting is the number of intelligent individuals who
	not only believe in the concept of socialism/communism, but were
	essentially apologists for Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, etc. through
	the period 1917-1950. it was if the pain of Russia's people was
	just a catharsis on the road to Utopia --by 1950, the apologia 
	wore rather thin...

	the guilt of the man who passed the trigger from White Sands is
	confirmed beyond a doubt by Verona also.

	granted, but with the outside information, sufficient I believe
	to raise more than an eyebrow and Alger Hiss certainly should not
	have been in the position of trust and power that he was. part of
	the evidence is based on process of elimination --if not Hiss,
	who was standing at FDR's side in incident or "give-up" time and
	time again?  with or without the McCarthy Red scare, I think the
	evidence was sufficient to convict, but then and again, I am known
	to be wrong --as above...
