We are an American social activist group called Las Americas, and 
we need your help. It is time to end the lies that everyone 
publishes about the Chiapas situation. We have to stop the war 
now!

We are tired of not being believed: the truth needs your help. 
The truth has to be told. Our main purpose is to show what is 
really going on in Chiapas. We want the world to know how 
neglected the people in Chiapas are.

In order for us to accomplish this mission, we need to provide 
tangible proof of all the events. We need pictures, sounds and 
video testimonies. 
We all have some kind of photographic equipment we don't use 
anymore. Right now, send us any type of new or old recording 
material: 
* Cameras
* Videos
* Tapes
* Cassettes
* Film
* Typewriters
* All kinds of recorders

All of these materials will be distributed to the indigenous 
communities so that they will be able to provide proof of their 
living conditions. The collected information will make up a huge 
and raw testimonial, which will convince even the skeptics that 
the war in Chiapas must end.
We are tired of lies being said about Chiapas. 
We need your support for this effort.
Take your chances, don't waste this great opportunity to 
participate and make a difference. 
Send the materials to:

LAS AMERICAS
Attn. President Ronald Granados
12501 East Imperial Highway 
Norwalk, CA 90650

You may also remit your suggestions and comments to our 
president.
We thank you in advance for your generous contribution and please 
forward this e-mail to as many people as you can.

P.S. If you are planning on making a personal visit, please find 
information enclose and don't forget to send us your 
testimonies!!
