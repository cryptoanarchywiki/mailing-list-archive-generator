Dear Friend,                                  
 
My name is Dave Rhodes.  In 1997 my cipher designs had all been broken, my 
patents declared without merit, and NIST had rejected my preliminary AES 
submission.  Then in early 1998 I received a letter in the mail telling me how 
I could earn fame as a cryptographer whenever I wanted.  I was naturally very 
skeptical and threw the letter on the desk next to my computer.  It's funny 
though, when you are desperate, backed into a corner, your mind does crazy 
things.  I spent a frustating day looking through the DES S-boxes for better 
differentials, but the pickings were sparse at best.  That night I tried to 
unwind by reading a few security newsgroups.  I read several of the posts and 
then glanced at the letter next to the computer.  All at once it came to me, I 
now had the key to my dreams.
 
This year I presented a paper at Crypto'98 and have one accepted for 
Eurocrypt'99.  Cryptographers from all over the world come to me for advice, 
and NIST has asked me to be on the AES evaluation board.  I will have my own 
crypto conference within 4 or 5 months.  Anyone can do the same.  This crypto 
method works perfectly every time, 100% of the time.  Best of all you never 
have to leave home except to go to your mailbox or post office.          
 
I realized that with the power of the computer I could expand and enhance this 
method into the most unbelievable system that has ever been created.  I 
substituted email in place of the post office and electronically did by 
computer what others were doing 100% by mail.  Most of the hard work is 
speedily handled by computers throughout the world.  If you believe that 
someday you deserve that lucky break that you have waited for all your life, 
simply follow the easy instructions below.  Your dreams will come true.
                                                                     
Sincerely yours,                                                
Dave Rhodes                                                          
                                     
INSTRUCTIONS
                                                                    
Follow these instructions EXACTLY, and in 20 to 60 days you will have searched 
well over 50 trillion DES keys.  This program has remained successful because 
of the honesty and integrity of the participants.  Please continue its success 
by carefully adhering to the instructions.  
                                                                   
1. Immediately send the following ciphertext/plaintext pair below to ten 
friends: 12F7E88920:0A2DE3172B
 
2. Remove the searched keyspace that appears at number 1 on the list below.  
Move the other 9 sets of searched keyspaces up one position.  Number 2 will 
become number 1 and number 3 will become number 2, etc.  Place the keyspace 
you've searched in the number 10 position.
            
3. Post the message with the keyspace you've tried in the number 10 position 
into 10 separate newsgroups or mailing lists, call the file BREAK.DES.FAST.
                                                                  
4. Within 60 days you will receive over 50 trillion further DES keys which 
people have tried.
 
This is not a scam.  This is perfectly legal.  If you have any doubts, refer 
to 22 USC Sec 2778.
