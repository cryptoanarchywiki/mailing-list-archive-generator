This is a new poem found in one of Dr. Suess' books:

Starr:
I'm here to ask
As you'll soon see --
Did you grope
Miss Lewinsky?

Did you grope her
In your house?
Did you grope
Beneath her blouse?

Clinton:
I did not do that
Here or there--
I did not do that
Anywhere!

I did not do that
Near or far --
I did not do that
Starr-You-Are

Starr:
Did you smile?
Did you flirt?
Did you peek
Beneath her skirt?

And did you tell
The girl to lie
When called upon
To testify?

Clinton:
I do not like you
Starr-You-Are --
I think that you
Have gone too far

I will not answer
Any more --
Perhaps I will go
Start a war!

The public's easy
To distract --
When bombs are
Falling on Iraq!
