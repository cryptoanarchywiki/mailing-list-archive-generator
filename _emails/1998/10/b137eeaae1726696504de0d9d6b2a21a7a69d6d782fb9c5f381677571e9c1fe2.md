We have been asked by a customer if we have any tests that demonstrate 
the randomness of the SSLeay random number generator (augmented by some
sound-card random number seeding that we wrote).

I'd like to find some standard implementation for testing randomness, but 
Schneier offers no help (other than a reference to Knuth Vol 2), and I
don't know where else to turn.

I realise that cryptographic randomness requires unpredictability, and
this quality depends upon closed-world assumptions about unknown individuals'
predictive powers, but we have to live with that.
