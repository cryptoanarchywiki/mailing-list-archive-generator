No global economy is a good economy, by its very definition it is a monopoly
and contrary to the entire precip of free-market pundits.

A free-market is exclusively a *local* market.

No it didn't, it's the basic economic structure that everything else gets
built on. You start out with a completely free-market and build from there.
Free markets are for cavepeople.

No, human psychology is what kills it.

Duh. Economics has nothing to do with civil liberties or crimes.

One of the failures in current political and economic thought is the
necessity for the *government* to regulate the money. It isn't a new belief
either since it is embodies in our Constitution.

What is required for a free-market is a mechanism for 'fair competition'.
The problem is there is no way under a free-market to define fair or
competition.

This is circular reasoning. A free-market is not compatible to democracy (of
course not since a free-market requires two party economic contracts
exculsively) but is compatible with a market that is solely stabalized by
economic (in)security (which is a free-market economy after all).

Duh...

Governments *are* a form of orthodoxy, they don't hold onto it since they
embody the concepts of orthodoxy.

Nobody with half-a-clue believe this.
