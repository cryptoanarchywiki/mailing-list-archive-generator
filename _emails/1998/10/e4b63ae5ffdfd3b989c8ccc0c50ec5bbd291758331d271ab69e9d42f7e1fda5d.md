This focus on former list members is getting tiresome.

We knew him as Davy Boone, of course, and helped him develop new modes of
communication to undermine the state. The proprietary managerial techniques
he transferred to the Soviets, helping to turn them into Pointy Hair
Managers, hastened the collapse of the U.S.S.R.

Something all crypto anarchists should support.

And for this Davy Boone is being persecuted? Gimme a break.

We need more digital cutouts, not fewer.
