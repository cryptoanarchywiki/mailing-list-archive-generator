Tom Allard,

Thanks much for forwarding Jeff Gordon's message.

I called Jeff at the number provided -- he answered --  I named
myself, described the message and asked if it was genuine, 
that spoofs had appeared on the list recently. 

He said, you mean it appeared on the cypherpunks list. 

I said yes it did and it'd be a help to know which messages 
are believable, that it's a bitch these days trying to figure out 
who's who and who's writing what. 

I said the msg'd be in  the archives shortly if he wanted to 
check it out, and offered  to forward a copy in the meantime. 

He said sure I'll take a look at it and let you know.

So I lobbed it up to WA, without the headers. See the
exchange below.

BTW, did anybody else get one of these? If so, send along,
in the clear or anon.

Thanks for checking on the authentication.  While I had not intended
this to be publicly distributed (call the Netiquette police!) it is not
a forgery
