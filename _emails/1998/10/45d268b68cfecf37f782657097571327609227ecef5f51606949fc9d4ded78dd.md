I've been a critic of some of Bob's "exuberance," his tendency to go off on
rhetorical flights of fancy, his irritating "ums" and "ers" and ":-}"s, and
his generally opaque writing style.

I think there's a kernel of good thinking in there, but his attention seems
to flit about. And he seems more interesting in cutesy turns of phrase than
in persuasive exposition.

If there's stuff there, it's lost in the freneticism.

Indeed.

I guess some folks are amazed that anyone can write the way Bob does. Me, I
was never amazed by the writings of Detweiler, Toto, or Hettinga.
