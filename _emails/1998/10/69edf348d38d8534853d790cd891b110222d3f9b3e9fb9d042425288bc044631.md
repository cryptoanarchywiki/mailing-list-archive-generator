No dirty trick, just a computer program let loose
 10.50 a.m. ET (1551 GMT) October 28, 1998

 GREENBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - When their phones rang in the middle of the night
this week, many residents expected the worst. 

 Death in the family? Fire? 

 No, just the bureaucratic tone of town supervisor Paul Feiner's taped
voice, advising of a change in local trash pickup times. 

 Couldn't this have waited until morning? 

 "I thought it was a member of my family,'' said Barbara Merriwether, 52.
"I thought something was wrong.'' 

 The timing of the 300 calls, of course, wasn't intentional. Someone at the
police department had forgotten to turn off an automated calling program
Monday evening, and the system ran through the night. 

 The only bad news in the affair may be for Feiner, who is trying to unseat
incumbent Republican Benjamin Gilman in the 20th Congressional District.
Feiner said may throw a party - with his own money - for everyone who was
called after 9 p.m.
