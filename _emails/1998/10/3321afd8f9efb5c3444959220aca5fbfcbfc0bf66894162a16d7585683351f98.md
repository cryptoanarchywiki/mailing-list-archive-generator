       WPI Cryptography and Information Security Seminar

                       Christof Paar, WPI

        REPORT ON THE ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD, AES


                       Wednesday, October 7
                         4:00 pm,  AK 108
                    (refreshments at 3:45 pm)


It is probably widely known that DES expires as a federal encryption
standard by the end of 1998. Currently NIST is overseeing the development of
a new block cipher, AES, which will become the DES successor.

The development process for AES is highly interesting as it has been (as of
yet) been a public process: Everyone was able to submit candidate algorithms
which are currently publicly reviewed.

My talk will mainly follow the excellent presentations by Miles Smid, who
is with NIST, at the AES1 and CRYPTO '98 conferences in August. I will
briefly review the main requirements for AES and talk about the submitted
algorithms. The talk will conclude with a description of how the AES
selection process will continue.
