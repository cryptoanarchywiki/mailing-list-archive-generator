It sounds like even the enlightened folks at NPR don't have the guts
to stand up and say something about issues as critical as expanded
FBI powers over citizens and the sneaky tricks used to pass those laws.

It's not really a big surprise, though.  Monica Lewinsky's blowjobs
take precedence over incredulous claims like 'NSA SPIES ON EVERYONE'
and 'FBI MONITORS YOU WITHOUT WARRANTS'.

They will have to live with their own lack of character. So will we.
