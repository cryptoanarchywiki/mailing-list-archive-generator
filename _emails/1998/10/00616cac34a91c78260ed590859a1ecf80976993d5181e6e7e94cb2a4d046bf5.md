Completely false. Traffic to/from the West coast did not warrant the
capital investment in transcontinental railway, so the government make
*exclusive* lands grants to specific railroads to extend the railways to
the West coast (100M acres between 1863-7) . Those subsidies created the
monopolies, the source of coercive power over Western farmers. Protest
against this arbitrary power was blamed on the market instead of the
government subsidies, and resulted in the Interstate Commerce Act of
1887, and the Sherman Act of 1890. 

I should have stated government "distortions" instead of "regulation."
That includes subsidies.

The placement (ownership) of these rights, their value, restrictions and
enforcement are the result of a free market? No, government
intervention.

Did anyone ever state monopolies result from federal regulations?
Government distortion/intervention, that can come at any level. Acts of
force or coercion can create a monopolistic situation, free trade
cannot.

So what is the discriminating factor(s) distinguishing industries that
can and cannot be monopolized?

Don't forget capital markets; a free fluid capital market can and will
support a smaller competitor if potential long term profits will support
it. I will qualify that we do not have a very free capital market, it
currently favors larger businesses. The answer is to deregulate the
capital market. Even with our heavily regulated capital markets this
works often.

Equality is about freedom of action, not status or result. Amazon vs
Barnes & Noble, Yahoo vs NBC, Red Hat vs Microsoft, etc.

I see the egalitarian perversion of "equality" polluting arguments
against free market capitalism. Equal states and "game" like fairness
and handicapping is not ideal, Freedom is ideal.

However buys and installs the switches and wires. There is no artificial
barriers such as right-of-way restrictions, exclusive franchise,
utilities commission, or nationalization. There are many competing
telecom companies, all the way to local loop.

That's a perverted definition of 'natural' monopoly. A 'natural'
monopoly involves something where all or none must benefit (e.g.
military defense) or something based on a severely scarce resource (e.g.
real estate to your house).

Market saturation is a natural effect of free competition, the number of
firms it takes is irrelevant, and competition is not barred by
artificial restraint, only profit. If a firm abuses its position
competition can and will capitalize on the opportunity. A coercive
monopoly is one that is immune to market constraints (supply and demand)
-- that requires artificial barriers.

> The VCR industry is a great example of a 'natural' monopoly. 

You must be joking. I could enter the video recording/playback equipment
market tomorrow with sufficient capitalization and turn good profits in
5 years. I didn't say VCR because that is terribly myopic, the market
demand is the function not the technology. Technology and innovation is
a natural destabilizer to monopoly positions.
