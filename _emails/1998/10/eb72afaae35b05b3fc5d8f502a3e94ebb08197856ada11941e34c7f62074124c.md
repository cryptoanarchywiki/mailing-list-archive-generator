Anyone conversant with configuring and using lotus notes and domino
mail server for email encryption?

I could use someone familiar with it to pick their brains on the
topic.

The purpose of this exercise is to find out the keys used in the lotus
notes export versions "international crypto" implementation
("differential key escrow" or whatever it's called -- the 40 bits
unescrowed, and 24 bits escrowed design).

First step is to get it to encrypt something.  I have a domino mail
server running, and the notes mail client, but am having difficulty
getting it to send encrypted mail.

Please email me.

Adam
