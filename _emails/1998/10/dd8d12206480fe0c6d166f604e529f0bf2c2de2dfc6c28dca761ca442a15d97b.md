But sadly in matters of law there are software patents and particularly
in cryptography. One may have different opinions on crypto patents
and endlessly debate on them. My personal opinion is that the
benefits of crypto patents do not outweigh their negative impacts
on the development and use of cryptography especially in view of 
the fact that a number of governments intend to suppress civilian 
usage of strong crypto with all means that they can think of.

I think that claiming copyright is a good idea, since one retains
some kind of control over the stuff that one creates. One can then 
say that copying is allowed for certain usages but disallowed in 
others. (As far as I know copying some pages from a book, but not
the whole, for scientific purposes is free generally.)
