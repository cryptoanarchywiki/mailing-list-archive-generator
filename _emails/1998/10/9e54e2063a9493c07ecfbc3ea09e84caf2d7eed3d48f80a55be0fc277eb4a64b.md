 To: Assignment Desk, Daybook Editor, Technology Writer
 Contact: Sue Richard for Americans for Computer Privacy,

   News Advisory:

   WHAT: Americans for Computer Privacy (ACP) will issue a coalition
         letter to House and Senate leaders urging legislation in the
         next Congress that will build on the reforms in encryption
         policy recently announced by the Administration. ACP will
         also report on the coalition's growth and future plans, as
         well as the response to its on-line advertising initiative.

   WHO:  ACP Executive Director Ed Gillespie; Rep. Bob Goodlatte
         (R-Va.); Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.); Rep. Sam Gejdenson
         (D-Conn.); Rep. Rick White (R-Wash.); Sen. John Ashcroft
         (R-Mo.); Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.); Sen. Ron Wyden
         (D-Ore.); Robert Holleyman, Business Software Alliance;
         Jerry Berman, Center for Democracy and Technology; and
         Grover Norquist, Americans for Tax Reform.

   WHEN:  Wednesday, Oct. 7, 11 a.m.

   WHERE: Room HC-7, U.S. Capitol,
          Washington, D.C.

   BACKGROUND: Since its formal launch in March 1998, ACP has worked
closely with Congress and the Administration on encryption policy
reform. While ACP acknowledges that progress has been made, the
coalition believes the encryption issue is far from resolved.
Americans for Computer Privacy brings together more than 100
companies and 40 associations representing financial services,
manufacturing, telecommunications, high-tech and transportation, as
well as law enforcement, civil-liberty, pro-family and taxpayer
groups. ACP supports policies that advance the rights of American
citizens to encode information without fear of government intrusion,
and advocates the lifting of current export restrictions on U.S.-made
encryption.

   For more information on ACP, please visit our website at
www.computer privacy.org. A cybercast of the press conference will be
available on the site on Thursday, Oct. 8.
