Could you guys _please_ change the subject lines to match what you are
talking about, when the thread strays from the original subject lines
topic.

It slows one down to have to scan further than subject fields.  Why
are you using subject fields about `GPL software' to discuss
monopolies / minarchy etc., interesting tho' these discussions may be,
please lable the subject line accordingly!

Thanks,

Adam
