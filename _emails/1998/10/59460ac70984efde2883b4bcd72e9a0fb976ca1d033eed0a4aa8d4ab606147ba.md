I'm currently sitting in a booth at a Tandem user show directly
opposite the Atalla one.  If there's anything in particular which
someone wants to ask them, let me know and I'll see how 
knowledgeable their salesdroids are.  Dunno how reliable my 
access to mail will be in the next day or two, if you're local
you could try calling me at the hotel I'm staying, which is the
Fairmont in San Jose (although you've got a whelks chance in a
supernova of actually catching me in my room, so you'll probably
have to leave a message).

Peter.
