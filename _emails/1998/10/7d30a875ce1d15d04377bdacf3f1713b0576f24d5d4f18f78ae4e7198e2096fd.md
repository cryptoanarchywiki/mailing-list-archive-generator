>From Jim Choate:

: The bottem line as to why free-market economies don't work is that it isn't
: in the producers best interest to have a educated consumer.  They might buy
: somebody elses product or start their own company. Both of those are bad for
: profits.
:
: Free-market mavens forget that producers are just as greedy and corrupt as
: everyone else, there is no fair competition in an unregulated market given
: the pshychological make up of human beings.
........................................................................................


Free market economices don't "work", simply because they are run by humans, who regularly suffer
psychological breakdowns, envy, and mistakes of judgement, not to mention disreputable marketing
departments.   Regulated economies, however, are run by government drones, and are therefore perfect
vehicles which, with unfailing success, make all of their captive customers happy.

Everyone knows this, as we witness the apparent success of all those regulated economies overseas
which outshine the U.S. by three (maybe four) orders of magnitude.  No one over there envies the
U.S. productivity and standard of living, and they never are moved to leave and come live over here,
to give up the benefits which extreme regulation confers upon them, in place of the (admittedly
mixed) free-market fiasco which operates over here, where all things are uncertain and frighteningly
unpredictable.

In fact, many people become so disgusted with the monopolies and disfunctional liberty which exists
here, that they regularly expatriate to go live in places like Sweden, Germany, even Canada, where
they have the peace of mind and assurance that State coercion will provide for their every need  -
in a most efficient, timely, prompt, and user-friendly manner.

They never have to worry about who has more or less, who is better or worse, or who knows better
than anyone what is best for everyone.  It's all been pre-established and exists incontrovertibly in
their national consumer database.
