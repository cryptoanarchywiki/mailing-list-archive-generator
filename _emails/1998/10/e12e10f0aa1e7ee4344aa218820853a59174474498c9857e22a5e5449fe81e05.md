Utopian socialism/communism believed that property is best managed and
owned by the people -- the people as some abstract collective entity aka
proletariat aka BORG. The dictatorial government is the agent of the
proletariat to abolish individual rights and transition to communist
utopia where government is no longer needed.

Of course actual socialism in mixed economies and communism in command
economies bear little resemblance to Marx's delusions.
