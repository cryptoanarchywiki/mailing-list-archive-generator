>   The formats used here are the result of a second generation

> Note to RFC Editor: Please add the following as an IESG Note:
> 
>    This document defines many tag values, yet it doesn't describe a
>    mechanism for adding new tags (for new features). Traditionally the
>    Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) handles the allocation of 
>    new values for future expansion and RFCs usually define the procedure 
>    to be used by the IANA.  However there are subtle (and not so subtle)
>    interactions that may occur in this protocol between new features and
>    existing features which result in a significant reduction in over all
>    security. Therefore this document does not define an extension
>    procedure. Instead requests to define new tag values (say for new 
>    encryption algorithms for example) should be forwarded to the IESG
>    Security Area Directors for consideration or forwarding to the
>    appropriate IETF Working Group for consideration.
