This is true in the United States as well.  That's why in every state,
technically speaking, their is no crime of "rape" just varying degrees and
types of "criminal sexual assault".  I'm suprised that hasn't trickled down
to france yet.  Rape is defined as forcing someone to have sexual
intercourse.  It doesn't take much imagination to build an argument that
you can't force a man to have sex, after all he had to get aroused.  The
advantage of criminal sexual assualt is that it side steps these kind of
issues by greatly broadening the crime to basicly forcing/manipulating
someone  to engae in any kind of sexual activity.
