Actualy it's how I make my living, supporting those large scale markets (I
won't argue the free part).

Where do I *ever* say we need 'government' monopolies. Not once, not ever.
I have said, and stand by it now, that what is needed is an *impartial* 3rd
party. That does *NOT* equate to 'the government'.

What is important to my thesis is that the regulator is impartial.
