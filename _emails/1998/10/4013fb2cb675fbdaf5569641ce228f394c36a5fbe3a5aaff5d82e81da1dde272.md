True enough. I figured if I kept typing I'd probably get into trouble with
somebody. Besides I just wanted to start a discussion for a couple of days
distraction.

There are many aspects of the various characteristics and I don't pretend to
be able to imagine them in all their combinatorial splendor.

One thing I know is that the social potential for video cameras in relation
to traffic management are immense. The problem is that their potential for
abuse when coupled with other sorts of technologies is absolutely
frightening. I don't believe that potential is enough to avoid them out of
hand.

No, what is needed in public places is anonymity. We want to be treated just
like everyone else. We specificaly don't want any identity.
