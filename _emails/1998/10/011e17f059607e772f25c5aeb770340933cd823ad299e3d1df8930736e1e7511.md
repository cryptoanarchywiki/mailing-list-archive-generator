I found this example in a book 

It's about Homophonic  substitution and 
I can't figure how they did it , I mean how the other letters where
substituted


Here's the example

Suppose the alphabet is mapped into the numbers 1  to 99 then

map E to 17,19,23,47,64
map A to 8,20,25,49
map R to 1,29,65
map T to 16,31,85
but otherwise the ith letter maps to the 3ith letter

Then the cleartext
MANY A SLIP TWIXT THE CUP AND THE LIP

will become

  08    20        16      3185  17      25    16  47
3608397220543324451666246931852117066045253909162147332445

My question is what/how did they represent the other letters like L (etc.)
coz I've tried to map them and yet I still can't understand
I even wrote A to Z then map them to 1 to 99, I still can't figure it out.

Could you also give me an example for polygram substitution.

Thank you very much.
SALAMAT PO.

Some people they might say that I'm hard to get to know.
I go my own sweet way, well that maybe so.
Something about the crowd that makes me walk alone. 
I never had a need in me to be the party's life and soul.

It's me Bernie.
