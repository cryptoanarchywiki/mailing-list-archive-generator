>     In those days, "franking" was the name of the game, meaning the
>    transmission of information by way of sophisticated encryptions on the
>    outside of an envelope. The trick was to take advantage of the
>    pre-Penny Black system of cash-on-delivery, where postmen demanded
>    exorbitant fees from recipients. Outwitting the Post Office involved
>    gleaning important information from, say, the way the address was
>    written, then refusing the letter on the grounds that it was too
>    expensive.
>    
>     The poet Coleridge tells the story of the most rudimentary sort of
>    frank, witnessed at an inn in the north of England. A postman offered
>    a letter to the barmaid and demanded a shilling. Sighing
>    melodramatically, she gave back the letter, protesting that she was
>    too poor to pay for it. Coleridge, ever the gentleman, insisted on
>    forking out the shilling, only to be shown afterwards that the
>    envelope was empty. The letter's message was in fact contained in a
>    number of subtle hieroglyphics alongside the address.
