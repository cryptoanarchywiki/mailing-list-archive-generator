Don't worry, Tim, you know it all already. Everything I ever learned on
this stuff, I learned from you, anyway.

Execpt the finance, of course. :-).

You know where the 'd' key is, and I bet you even know how to use your

fly the black helicopters over your house. Otherwise, they might not even
know you're there, hmmm?

Oh, well. You can't always pick your friends. Or your friend's nose, for
that matter. <Ewwwwww...>
