> particular problems, nor command the States' officers, or those of their =
> political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory =
> program.' "

> 
> "Although Congress has regulated the disclosure of personal information =
> by some private parties, the Constitution permits Congress to regulate =
> the conduct of individuals. In contrast, Congress may not, as a general =

> 166 ("[T]he Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon =
> Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States." (quoted with =
> approval in Printz, 117 S. Ct. at 2377)). "

> Congress's power to enact legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment is =

> 2157, 2171 (1997) (holding that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is =
> "a considerable congressional intrusion into the States' traditional =
> prerogatives," and that Congress exceeded its power under the Fourteenth =
> Amendment in enacting the statute); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, =
> 469 (1991) (stating that "the Four- teenth Amendment does not override =
> all principles of federalism"); Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 128 =
> (1970) (noting that "[a]s broad as the congressional enforcement power =
> is, it is not unlimited"). For instance, Congress's power "extends only =

> Boerne, 117 S. Ct. at 2164 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks =
> omitted). Of perhaps equal importance, it is only a preventative or =
> remedial power, not a substantive power. See id. at 2167. As a result, =
> Congress does not possess "the power to determine what constitutes a =
> constitutional violation." Id. at 2164.=20
