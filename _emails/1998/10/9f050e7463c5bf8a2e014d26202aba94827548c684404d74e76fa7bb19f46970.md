Coke is a free-market? That's a laugh. I suggest you study the history of
the Crips and related gangs, or the international Coke distributors. At no
time was there more than a dozen or so groups and they worked cooperatively
in many cases. As to the 'various mafias', in case you hadn't heard, they've
been organized and integrated for about 30-40 years depending on who you ask.
They cooperatively divide up territories and product lines between them to
guarantee a minimum of violence and maximize profit for each member. However,
I would lay dollars to donuts that if you were to go start your own family
there would be very little consideration as to the consequences.

Make no bones about it, if we're talking national or international crime it
is most definitely organized and cooperatively arranged between a small set
of players. That's a monopoly.
