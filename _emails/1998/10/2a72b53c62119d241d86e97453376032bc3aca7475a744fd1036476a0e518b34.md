MSJ conflicts with the MS white paper in that, according to MS,you can
explicitly turn off key recovery at the domain level.  For
workstations not a part of a domain, key recovery can be turned
off at the local administrator level.

The domain setting overrides the local administrator setting
as long as the workstation is a member of a domain. So the
answer to your question, apparently, depends on the local
administrator's settings for the encryption policy.

Their summary is somewhat simplified.  The key managementhas several
alternatives with the usual tradeoffs between
security and convenience.  The private key for recovery can
be stored on a floppy, encrypted using a passphrase, or
for that matter can be destroyed.

Yes, if you are using self-signed certificates they are
generated randomly during each install.
