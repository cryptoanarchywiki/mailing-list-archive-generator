And you don't get to try such short ones either....

What specificaly is there about the relationship between natural gas and
gasoline that leads you to believe that the comparison of lethality between
the waste products of a coal plant vurses a nuclear plant is such that the
waste of a nuclear plant is more lethal because there is more toxic
byproduct and it is in higher concentrations?
