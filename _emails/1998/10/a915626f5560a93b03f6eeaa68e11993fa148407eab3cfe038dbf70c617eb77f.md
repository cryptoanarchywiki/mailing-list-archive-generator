> NONLOCALITY GETS MORE REAL.  "Bell's Inequalities," the
> set of mathematical relations that would rule out the notion that
> distant quantum particles exert influences on each other at
> seemingly instantaneous rates, have now been violated over record
> large distances, with record high certainty, and with the elimination
> of an important loophole in three recent experiments, further
> solidifying the notion of "spooky action at a distance" in quantum
> particles.  At the Optical Society of America meeting in Baltimore
> earlier this month, Paul Kwiat (kwiat@lanl.gov) of Los Alamos and
> his colleagues announced that they produced an ultrabright source
> of photon pairs for Bell's inequality experiments; they went on to
> verify the violation of Bell's inequalities to a record degree of
> certainty (preprint at p23.lanl.gov/agw/2crystal.pdf). Splitting a
> single photon of well-defined energy into a pair of photons with
> initially undefined energies, and sending each photon through a
> fiber-optic network to detectors 10 km apart, researchers in
> Switzerland (Wolfgang Tittel, Univ. Geneva,
> wolfgang.tittel@physics.unige.ch) showed that determining the
> energy for one photon by measuring it had instantaneously
> determined the energy of its neighbor 10 km away--a record set by
> the researchers last year but now demonstrated in an improved
> version of the original experiment. (Tittel et al., Physical Review
> Letters, 26 October 1998.) A University of Innsbruck group
> performed Bell measurements with detectors that randomly switched
> between settings rapidly enough to eliminate the "locality loophole,"
> which posited that one detector might somehow send a signal to the
> other detector at light or sub-light speeds to affect its reading.
