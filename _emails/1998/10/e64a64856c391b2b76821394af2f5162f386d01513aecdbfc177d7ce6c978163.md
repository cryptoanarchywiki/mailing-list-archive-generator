>Bee in the bonnet: A few days before CJ's arrest warrant was issued 
>the DoJ put out a study on the "Shared Traits of Potential Assassins:"

>The traits:

    * To achieve notoriety or fame.
    * To bring attention to a personal or public problem.
    * To avenge a perceived wrong; to retaliate for a perceived injury.
    * To end personal pain; to be removed from society; to be killed.
    * To save the country or the world; to fix a world problem.
    * To develop a special relationship with the target.
    * To make money.
    * To bring about political change.

How does this differ from the motives of your ordinary politician?

Post-revolution, will there be caliber limitations when hunting them?
