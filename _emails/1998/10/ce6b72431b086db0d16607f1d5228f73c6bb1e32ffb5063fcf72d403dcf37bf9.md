:The Good News is that I have a pen to write
:with, due to the Free Enterprise System being
:alive & well within the Prison System.
:
:The Bad News is that Micro$oft Pens (TM)
:controls 95% of the market...
:
:I am hoping you can share as much of this
:communique as possible with the CPUNX,
:since my chain is constantly getting yanked
:in different directions, making outside contact
:sporatic & unreliable.
:
:Feel free to reserve for your own use any
:of the enclosed information you need for your
:own journalistic purposes.
:
:I will try to reach you by phone (automated
:collect-call system requiring touch-tone on
:your end).
:
:Thanks for the Mags,

:
:Looks like you may be receiving the *only* copy
:of the Florence Nutly News, since I have, up
:until now, been writing on paper towels and
:medicine cups, using combinations of blood,
:sperm and chocolate (two of which are in short

:to Nutly News Head (pardon the pun) Quarters
:in Springfield, Missouri, for Rewiring of
