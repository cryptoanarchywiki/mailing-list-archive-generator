Normally, an announcement of 128-bit crypto capabilities for a
home computer would mean the user has control of said crypto.

The WebTV computer:   http://developer.webtv.net/docs/sysgde/Default.htm

   o WebTV supports connectivity to the ISP of your choice.

   o Internet access (PPP, PAP)

   o HTML 1.0; HTML 2.0; HTML 3.2; frames compatibility; JavaScript 1.2

   o Image: GIF89a animation; JPEG; Progressive JPEG; PNG; TIFF-G3 fax in e-mail;
     X bitmap; Macromedia[tm] Flash 1.0

   o Audio: AU; . WAV; Real Audio 1.0; 2.0; 3.0; AIFF; Shockwave[tm] Audio; GSM;
     MPEG-1 Audio; MPEG-2 Audio; MPEG Layer 3; MOD; General MIDI; MIDI Karaoke;
     Quicktime audio; Zip decompression

   o Video: PEG-1 Video; MPEG-3 Video; VideoFlash[tm]

   o Processor: 112/167 Mhz R4640 processor

   o Security: SSL version 2 and 3; 40bit and 128bit RC4 encryption;
     root certificates for GTE, RSA Data Security (VeriSign), Thawte,
     and VeriSign Class 3 digital certificates

Can WebTV send end-to-end encrypted email to any other Net user?

Nope.

The press release claiming WebTV has 128-bit security
is another low in advertising obtuseness.
