TOKYO, Sept. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- CASIO COMPUTER CO., LTD. announces 
development of the MDSR (Multi-Dimensional Space Rotation) encryption 
system for Internet and Intranet data.

MDSR is a new encryption system designed to meet the need for 
high-level digital data security, which has been generated with 
the growth of the Internet and Intranets.

The encryption system used by MDSR is based on Multi-Dimensional 
Space Rotation (MDSR) and Time-Dependent Multi-Dimensional Space 
Rotation (MDSR-TD). The main features of this encryption system 
are: the larger the space dimension the more difficult it is to 
break the code, no special hardware requirements for encryption 
or decryption, and the ability to narrowly regulate hierarchy 
and decryption privileges. The result is an encryption system 
that provides versatile private data management, confidential 
mail security, and security for data sent to multiple 
destinations. Since MDSR also enhances security for data on 
an Internet server, it is also suitable for use by system
administrators and Internet Service Providers.
 
The contest that is detailed on the CASIO Home Page starts 
from September 24, with a cash prize for the person who 
successfully breaks a message encoded with MDSR. CASIO plans 
to use MDSR in future CASIO data communication products.

Contest Details
 
Term:           September 26, 1998 to November 26, 1998 (JST)
