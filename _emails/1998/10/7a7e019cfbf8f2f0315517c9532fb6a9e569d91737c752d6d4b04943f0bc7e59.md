I'm familiar with C2Net. If Stronghold is any good, that is because
C2net and/or the Apache team know what they are doing, not just because
they picked up a free SSL library on the net. It's easy to build
insecure products on good crypto, and many other companies are busy
doing just that. In fact, it's funny that you tout a "secure web server"
as "strong crypto" since in that context SSL is usually vulnerable to
being end-run by web spoofing. Oops. Oh well, it uses strong crypto, so
it must be good.

Then I guess you agree that closed-source deployment is neither
necessary nor sufficient to achieve "strong crypto". Not really sure why
you're arguing in that case.

That's condescending and irrelevant. Did anyone ever fix web spoofing?

Yes, and yes. (I don't think you understand the term "name dropped" btw.
But given the name-dropping and appeal-to-authority tone of your whole
post, I wonder if you understand the term "irony").

Cheers,
Frank O'Dwyer.
