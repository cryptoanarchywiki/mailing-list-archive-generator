That's cool man, I see your point.  Guess I shouldn't knock it when
I've only had one experience.  It's true, I got on the train quicker
than I've ever gotten on a flight and didn't face any harrassment. 
Actually, I faced more harrassment from my Gestapo math teacher in
high school trying to board a bus than getting on the train.  He
looked at me and told me I was trouble and searched every crevice of
my bag, personal being and space.  "But doctor, both your hands on my
shoulders. . ."you get the point and that's exactly what's happening
to us each and every day.
