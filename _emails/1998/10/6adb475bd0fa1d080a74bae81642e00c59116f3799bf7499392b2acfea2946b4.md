Actualy, something like Plan 9 would be more effective. That way the thing
is distributed from the get go. With a suitably object oriented approach it
could be feasible to distribute the data to specific servers but encode the
program in the connections between the servers task swappers. By using Plan
9's economic resource bidding model it injects a level of anonymity in the
repetitive execution aspect that wouldn't normaly be there.
