Except for police intervention, anyone is free to buy coke
from dealers affiliated with the Crips, affiliated with the
Bloods, or affiliated with any one of several smaller
providers of such services.

Generally competition between these groups mostly resembles
the competition between Visa and Mastercard with shoot outs
being the exception rather than the rule.  Shootouts are bad
for business.
