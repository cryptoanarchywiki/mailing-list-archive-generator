	Microsoft is nowhere NEAR a monopoly. Yes, they are the largest in
their niche, but they are coming under increasing competition, and even

increasing competition from Linux, Solaris x86, and possibly MacOS X.

of them is the Government causing the problems it later seeks to solve with
more legislation.
