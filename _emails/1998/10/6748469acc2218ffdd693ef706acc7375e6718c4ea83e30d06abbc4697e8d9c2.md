Not sure it's what you're looking for but:

Statistical Distributions
M. Evans, N. Hastings, B. Peacock
ISBN 0-471-55951-2

It's got around 40 different distributions and their related equations and
characteristics. There is also an appendix that lists the various
distributions and the functions in several computational math programs (go
MapleV !)...

Now if you're looking for various approaches to how to impliment it then I
can't help you there, I cookbook that sort of stuff out of my library.

Have you tried Knuth?
