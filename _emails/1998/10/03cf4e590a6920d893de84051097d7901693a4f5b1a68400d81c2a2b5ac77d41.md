House Passes Roving Wiretaps, Expanding Federal Surveillance Powers 

 October 7, 1998 

In a closed-door manuever, controversial "roving wiretap" provisions have
been added to a major Intelligence authorization bill and passed by the
House. Current wiretapping law allows tapping of a particular person's
phones. The new provisions would dramatically expand current authority by
allowing taps on any phone used by, or "proximate" to, the person being
tapped +IBQ- no matter whose phone it is. Such a broad law invites abuse. 

In the last Congress, the full House of Representatives rejected these
provisions after an open and vigorous debate. This week, behind closed
doors, a conference committee added the provisions to the important
Intelligence Authorization Conference Report, almost certain to pass the
Congress. The provisions were not in either the original House or Senate
versions of the bill. CDT is particularly concerned that such an expansion
of federal authority should take place without a public debate. 


"Roving Wiretaps" Language added to H.R. 3694, the Intelligence
Authorization Conference Report.

specified 
facility;''; 

(2) in clause (iii), by striking ``such purpose'' and all that follows
