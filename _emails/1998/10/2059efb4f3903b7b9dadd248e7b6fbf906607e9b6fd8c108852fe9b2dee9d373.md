Yup I can confirm that one for England.  I made the mistake of
registering a Ltd company to do crypto hacking through, and you would
not believe the mountain of forms they send you.  I reckon I must've
had order of a foot deep pile of paper sent to me since doing it.  As
a one man type operation, most of it can go straight in the trash, but
you've still got to sift it.
