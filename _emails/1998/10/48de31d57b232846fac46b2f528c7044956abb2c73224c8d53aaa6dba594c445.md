The IRS offered to pay my travel from the local Austin airport to Seattle
and pay the hotel bill and meals. I was trying to determine how
transportation in Seattle was going to be handled when they said they didn't
need me in person.

I told them I didn't want to go to Seattle, they suggested an affadavit.

Exactly what I did after checking to make sure I didn't. They said 'Ok'.

What lawyer? You don't get a lawyer with Grand Juries.

Not even hardly. A subpoena isn't an accussation, it's an instrument to
obtain potentialy relevant testimony and evidence. It means (at least in
this case) "We believe you may know something or have possession of
information related, but not necessarily directly involved in this matter."
The sub-channel message is "Don't fuck with us, you're only about a hairs
breadth away from hell on earth."

Besides, they wanted me to testify *for* the prosecution, preferebly
willingly. The last thing they were going to do was go heavy handed.

If the operators are that jumpy I suspect they wouldn't put up with the
bills, occassional stupid private emails, the costs in time, etc. I knew
this sort of stuff was a possibility. The only issue that took me by
surprise was two officers showing up at work unannounced. It took me till
the next day to burn off the heeby-jeebies from that.

Of course, a truly motivated and worried, not to mention well heeled,
cypherpunks might consider putting up a node themselves....<nah>
