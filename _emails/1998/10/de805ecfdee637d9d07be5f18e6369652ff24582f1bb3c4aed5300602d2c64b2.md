Who said anything about 'artificial'? You have a sneaky habit of sticking
terms in there where they don't go hoping somebody won't catch it. We're
talking a free-market, there are *only* two participants; provider and
consumer. If I allow 'artificial' in there then there is the explicit
assumption that a third party is now involved. I won't accept a
bastardization of free-market in that manner.

If you want to expand your argument by the injection of these spurious terms
(they aren't relevant to my argument) feel free. Be warned I will continue
to point out the distinction vis-a-vis the impact on conclusions.

I mean *dominate* the market. Quit sticking extra terms in there trying 
to subtly change the meaning. I promise you I will notice so you can quit
now.

No, that is the definition of monopoly. Now what and how they got and retain
that position may invoke coercion but it *isn't* a requirement for
monoplies by definition. Don't try to confuse method with type.

Demonstrate please. The problem with this view is that it implies that given
sufficient time *any* market strategy will fail. In other words there is no
best or efficient strategy for a given market. In the past when this has
been brought up I've asked for an explanation of how this dynamic works and
specificaly what prevents such best-of-breed examples from existing.

I'm still waiting for such an explanation.
