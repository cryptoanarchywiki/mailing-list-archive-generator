Jim Choate retorted to my statement:

:> They never have to worry about who has more or less, who is better or worse,
:> or who knows better than anyone what is best for everyone.  It's all been
:> pre-established and exists incontrovertibly in their national consumer database.
:
: It would be nice if  you said something other than "I disagree". It would
: really be nice if you cold describe specific examples and hypothesis, but
: that obviously is asking too much.
............................................................................


Why, where do you see any "I disagree" statement?

And really, I don't mind providing specific examples and hypotheses -  can you give me an idea where
I might look for these?
