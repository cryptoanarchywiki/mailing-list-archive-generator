Then your argument that free markets lead to monopoly collapses.

You cannot have monopoly (in the sense of the power to extract monopoly of
profits) except by state intervention as has been proven by experience time
and time again.

You have been unable to provide any examples of monopolies except those
created by state intervention, such as the railaways, and those existent
soley in your fevered imagination, such as the garment industry.
