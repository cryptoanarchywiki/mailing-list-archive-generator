Actualy you are ascribing an effect as the cause. The information is there
because the holders believe it's in their best interest to dissiminate it.
As companies (the US Army' current behaviour is a good example) become to
respect the distribution capability of the internet you'll see a reduction
of information available.

Malarky. Reputation is irrelevant, just examine the prisoners delima.
Those who put reputation over action are setting themselves up for a classic
abuse of trust.

More often that not regulation is the result of abuse of the market by a
manufacturer and is imposed ex post facto. It's intent is to eliminate
future abuses.
