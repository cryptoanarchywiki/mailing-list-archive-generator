My impression is that the instability described is due to fragmentation of the
virtual memory space, which happens faster on NT than Unix because of 
the relative immaturity of NT memory management. The side comment about
Mac's being even worse would support this hypothesis (as Mac memory management
is a joke).

The Netscape SQA theory doesn't explain why other products also become 
less reliable on NT (and worse again on 95).
