Y2K  Solution!
8  Pine  Circle  Dr., Silicon  Valley, Calif.

OTC  Company  "TCFG"  21 st. Century  Frontier  Group  has
through  several  members  of  their  administrative  research
department  leaked  vital  information  about  their  companies  
efforts.

Everyone  was  tight  lipped  and  interviews  were  refused,
and  through  un-named  sources  we  have  learned  that  the  
technology  and  software  solution  are  in  the  process  of  
being  patented!

In over  1640  trials, using  various  data  systems  the  use  
of  the  new  technology  and  software  solved  the  Y2K
problem  100%  of  the  time. 

This  small  publicly  traded  company  "TCFG"  which  is  just
3  years  old  is  through  various  sources  now  negotiating
with  the  "Big  Boys"!

"TCFG"  the  letters  to  look  for!
