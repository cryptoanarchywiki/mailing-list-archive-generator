Right.  The new Happy Net campaign.

Druggies.. why, they're friendly enough to
be elected officials in such peaks of civilization as D.C. and L.A.
And the more successful recreational pharmaceutical merchants 
are luxury-car and mobile telecomm early adopters!

Pedophiles.  Well, consider that Kennedy and his babysitter..
You'd still vote for him, right? 

Terrorists.  Well, shoot, everyone needs to express themselves
some times.  One day you're a terrorist, the next you're boosting
the POTUS's ratings a few points with a handshake.
