In the middle of an interesting article about digital cash, forwarded
here by Bob Hettinga, there was the line:

> After all, the kind of soccer moms who elected Bill Clinton

"Divided by a common language" as I am  I genuinly don't know what that
means. And I can't even guess from context. I'd have expected a dig at
liberals or feminists or welfare recipients at that point; and I can't
work out what soccer has to do with it.

Do mothers play soccer much in the USA?

Football (as the 95% of the world's population that aren't either
English-speaking North Americans or else Rugby fans call the Beautiful
Game) is associated in my mind with young men, specifically working
class men. It's connotations are entirely macho, even violent.  When a
big match is on men gather in pubs and bars and shout at TVs whilst
knocking back the lager. You avoid the centre of town if you don't want
to risk getting involved in a fight.  People get *killed* at football
matches.  That's pretty much true in every big city inthe world outside
North America (and Japan where the fans are polite). 

This honestly isn't a troll - I am in fact bewildered by the phrase.
