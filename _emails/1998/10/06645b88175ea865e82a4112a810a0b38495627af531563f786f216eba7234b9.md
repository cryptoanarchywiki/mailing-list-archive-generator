Actualy the optimal value is even easier to calculate.

Given an initial array, A(m), and the desire to randomly swap the contents
until there is sufficient entropy to pass the various statistical tests
leaves us with:

Given m initial element and we are swapping them two at a time then we
need to execute at most m/2 swaps to randomize the array.

So, the optimal SWAP_TIMES ends up being, in this case, 128.

This of course doesn't touch on the new rule above about testing for x=y.
In which case you could simply do it over again. Now given that there are
m elements and the odds of selecting any given one is 1/n and the odds of
selecting it twice at one time is 1/n^2.
