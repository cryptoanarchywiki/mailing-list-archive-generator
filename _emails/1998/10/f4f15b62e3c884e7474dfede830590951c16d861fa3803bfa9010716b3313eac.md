PARTIES CONSPIRE TO KEEP IMMIGRATION OUT OF ELECTION, BOOK SHOWSThe 
author of a new book called "This Tired Brown Land" has accused the 
majorpolitical parties of conspiring to keep immigration and population off 
theelection agenda. The book has already attracted good 
reviews.Author Mark O'Connor today claimed that both the major political 
partieswere suppressing discussion in order to deny One Nation 'the oxygen 
ofpublicity'. But it is exactly such bipartisan ignoring of public 
sentimenton immigration which caused One Nation, and led to the enormous 
success ofPaul Sheehan's book Among the Barbarianns.Immigration 
Minister Philip Ruddock recently launched the Coalition'spolicy in Perth-too 
late in the day for the Eastern media to pick up thestory. Says author Mark 
O'Connor, 'Clearly the Coalition knows its policyis not what the electorate 
wants.'Polls show that the electorate has made up its mind. Only 2% or 
3% ofvoters want immigration increased; and they are outnumbered, some 30 
toone, by the 65% or 70% who want it reduced. Neither ethnic Australians 
norAborigines support higher immigration. Most Australians 
supportmulticulturalism, yet want an immediate moratorium on 
immigration.'My book shows that in 1994-95 (under Labor) our net 
migration gain (ABSfigures) was 80,100 persons. Last year it was 83,700. 
Despite this, theCoalition has tried to give the impression of reducing 
immigration. Somecritics have even accused the government of 
"racism" for "reducingimmigration". This is 
false.'The book is available throough bookshops at $16.95, orby 
cheque or money order from Duffy & Snellgrove for $19.95 (includes p&p)
