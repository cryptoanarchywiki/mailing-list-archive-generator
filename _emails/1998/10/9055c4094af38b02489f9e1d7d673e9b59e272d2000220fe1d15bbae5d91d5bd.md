On 10/1/98 2:50 PM, Robert Hettinga (rah@shipwright.com)  passed this 
wisdom:

 Ever since I discovered my ADHD some two or three years after I started 
working with ADHD kids in the our school district a lot of things began 
to make sense.  But I came to realize and now make it a point to tell 
these kids that taken as a whole ADD/ADHD is a blessing more so than a 
curse. The ability to hyper-focus on a task at hand gives you the power 
to do in a few hours sometimes things it would take others a day or more 
to do. For the truly ADD kid (as opposed to the culturally induced 
variety) the hell he has gone through and the incredible low self-esteen 
they generally have, just hearing that is often enough to make a radical 
turn-around for them.
