Obviously this so.

There is MUCH more involved than simply making a profit.

Whoa horsey. I didn't say a damn thing about any third party regulatory
agency getting invovled here. Don't start trying to change the rules in the
middle of the game.

Wrong. Socialism is the belief that property is best managed and owned by
the government. This is within the context of a free market. This means that
the *ONLY* two parties involved are the producers and consumers. I am
discussing an alternative approach to business management.

Fascism is the belief that property should be owned by private individuals
but managed by governments.

Capitalism is the belief that property should be owned and managed by the
individual. Note that this definition doesn't prevent 3rd party regulatory
bodies, but they neither own or manage the activity, only limit its' scope.
