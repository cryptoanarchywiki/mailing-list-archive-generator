Your observation is in fact correct.  The fear must be
shown to be *exaggerated* for the benefit of the fearmongers.
The intrusion must be shown to be not just intruding on "them"
but on "us".  (Europe's recent interest in Echelon may be an example
of the latter.)

Sheeple will *eventually* learn (again) that nasty people
will always do nasty things with the technology du
jour, and mostly the police just mop up afterwards.
(If it isn't the State doing the nasty things in the
first place.)  Of course, we might have an intervening dark ages
for a millenia or two, but in the long run, you get a clue or 
go extinct.

You don't ban something as basic as metal or
encryption because some people do bad things with it.
And you don't depend on laws to secure privacy.

In the meantime, morons whine for State control 
of metal, while barbarians are destroying the town's 
wooden walls with metal rams, and protective metal walls aren't being
deployed because the townies fear that the bad townies will abuse metal.
