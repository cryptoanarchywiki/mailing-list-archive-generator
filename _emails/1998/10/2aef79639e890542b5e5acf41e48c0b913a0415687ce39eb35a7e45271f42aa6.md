A free market is not the absence of law (that is anarchy), a free market
is the absence of government intervention in trade and commerce.

That does not mean people and businesses are immune from criminal law,
fraud statutes, civil liability, etc.

The market addresses information disclosure by favoring vendors that
disclose. The legal system addresses intentional misinformation.

You are confusing Laissez Faire [free market] Capitalism with
Anarcho-Capitalism.
