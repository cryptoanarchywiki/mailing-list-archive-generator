Ah, ok I think I have it.....

 So we start out with N words (2 bytes):

   0  1  2  ...  n-2 n-1 n
   *  *  *       *   *   *

   ^
 15...8 7...0
   rng   ind

So the ordering of bits 8-15 moves the originaly ordered indexes to
positions correlated to relative magnitude of the rng part.

That certainly looks like it'd work.

Thanks for the clarification.
