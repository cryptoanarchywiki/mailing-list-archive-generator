I expressed myself badly.  Steve Gibbons posted a message
to Coderpunks expressing more clearly what I had in mind:
Fill up the high bits of your N words with random numbers and
the low bits with an index from 0 to N-1.  Sort the array, then
mask off the high bits.  If the random numbers were unique, you
are left with a randomly shuffled array.
