Jim Choate claims that free markets are routinely overrun by
monopolies.  I say this is nonsense.

How can anyone present evidence when except for Microsoft you
have not named a single company that alleged became a
monopoly, and you have been vague about the markets that
these companies allegedly monopolized, and the periods during
which these markets were monpolized.

It is as if you were claiming that giant monsters frequently
terrorized US cities.  Unless you make a specific allegation,
no refutation is possible or necessary.

For example if you were to claim that King Kong demolished
the empire state building, then someone could point out that
the empire state building still stands.

A simple explanation for your inability to name any specific
giant monsters, or any particular places and times where
these giant monsters were rampaging, is that these giant
monsters do not exist, and never have existed.

MacDonalds vs Burger King.  Hertz vs Avis.  Mastercard vs
Visa.

And of course, the biggest mismatch of them all 

Microsoft vs Linux.

Holland used to do this on the grounds that shoes were a
vital necessity, and if the market was left to private
enterprise some people would go shoeless.

There is no empirical evidence that any natural monopolies
exist.

This does not make the VCR business a monopoly.  It would
only be a monopoly if the existing players were free to raise
prices.  Manifestly the market for the mechanism of the VCR
has become a commodity market, in which profit margins are
extremely low.

The same is true of the aluminium market, where you have all
aluminium smelted by a single provider.  There is nothing to
stop anyone else from going into the business, but because
the profit margins are razor thin, nobody bothers.  Although
there is only a single company, it is not a monopoly because
if they expanded their very thin proft margins by the
slightest degree, other people would promptly eat their
lunch.
