Most international U.S. corporate telecommunications are not encrypted.
Some countries do not allow encryption of telecommuni-cations traffic
within their borders, but it should be considered where feasible for any
transmission of competitive information.

Many telecommunications transmissions will contain "key words", used to
identify information of interest to a third party.  A key word can be the
name of a technology, product, project, or anything else which may identify
the subject of the transmission.  

       Encryption should be the first line of defense since it is easier
for foreign intelligence services to monitor lines than to place "bugs",
however encryption will provide little if any security if a careful
examination for audio "bugs" elsewhere in the room is not conducted.
