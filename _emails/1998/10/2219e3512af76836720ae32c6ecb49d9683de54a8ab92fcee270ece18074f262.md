[Note from Matthew Gaylor: Several years ago on this list I mentioned that
EMP devices will soon be used to stop car chases.  Several of my
subscribers wrote in and said I must be crazy, that I lived in a science
fiction fantasy.  Oh well, the future is now.]

* Evaluation of Vehicle Stopping Electromagnetic Prototype
Devices: Phase III - Engineering Field Testing Solicitation

To curtail high-speed chases, NIJ is requesting applications
for prototype electromagnetic devices designed to stop motor
vehicles that are in motion. Approved applicants will
provide prototypes for field testing, with the hope of
proceeding to operational testing by law enforcement
agencies. The NIJ Solicitation, "Evaluation of Vehicle
Stopping Electromagnetic Prototype Devices: Phase III -
Engineering Field Testing," provides information on
application requirements and deadlines.

"Evaluation of Vehicle Stopping Electromagnetic Prototype
Devices: Phase III - Engineering Field Testing"
(Solicitation) (SL000298) is available on the NCJRS World
Wide Web site (http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/sl298.txt)
