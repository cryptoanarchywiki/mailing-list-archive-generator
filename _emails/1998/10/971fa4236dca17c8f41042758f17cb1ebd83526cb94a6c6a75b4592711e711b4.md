As the FUD snowballs. The Globe gets Rimmed again...

The edutocracy (and the Boston Globe :-)) finally notices that all that
artillery parked at the foot of their ivory tower actually *does* blow
great big rocks into tiny little bits...


In another context, Carl Ellison has this great story about how, when
firearms were invented, peasants could finally kill knights in armor from a
comfortable distance. When the church reminded them that killing knights
was a sin, peasants started killing knights on weekdays and confessing
those sins in church on Sunday.


Frankly, I've learned more on the net in the last few years than I ever
would have in an equivalent time in school. I credit it with a
several-point increase in my IQ, even.

Woops. We don't count IQ anymore, now do we?... :-).


I guess I know too many stone geniuses who've had computers since they were
children -- most of the people on this list were raised that way, I would
bet -- to take this crap too seriously, reduced attention "spans" or not.

By the way, "span" is the wrong word for ADD. I was hardly raised on TV,
much less computers, (I had my face in science fiction books throughout
most of my childhood), and I've been known to focus on something
"inappropriately" for hours.

While I certainly have varying degrees of control of my attention, but I
just don't see that a "handicap" anymore. My attention is event-driven,
rather than processed in neat organized batches, and I've learned to like
it that way, even if it did give me trouble when I was chained in the
aforementioned tower's dungeon for most of my formative years.

Besides, even if computers cause people to have event-driven attention
rather than in nice neat industrial batches, that's probably a Good
Thing(tm). Consider it evolution in action.

Farmers and mechanics may need "control" of their attention, but in an
information "hunter" like myself, most of the people who do anything useful
on the net, it's a selective disadvantage.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga

>
>               Budin, who is director of the Center for Technology and

>
>               Even so, it can lead to the kind of problems teachers

>
>               ''Who's teaching these kids how to use it and where the

>

>
>               In many schools, the problem is lack of human
> infrastructure, says
>               technology researcher Vicki O'Day, of the Xerox Palo

>

>
