JG Note:

  Preliminary advice from an attorney is that it is likely the
  Electronic Communications Privacy Act covers this request for stored
  electronic communications, therefore requiring a real warrant (not a
  subpoena), reimbursement for the expenses of complying, etc.

  Others (if any) who have received similar subpoenas should
  consult with their attorneys, and are encouraged to publish
  (to the list and the JYA.COM web site) anything they receive
  from the government.  Having more information is usually
  a good thing; currently the prosecutor knows what he's doing,
  so to speak, but we don't.
