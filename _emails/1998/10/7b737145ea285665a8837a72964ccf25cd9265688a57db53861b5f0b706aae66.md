(Mr/Mrs/Ms) Hack,

Many thanks in advance for your generous and gracious assistance.

Please tell me where I've headed off the proper path.

Without having read any detailed descriptions I thought an AP bot might
do the following :

Form a token pool associated with some desired event.

Accept tokens from any source into that pool.

Transfer the entire pool of tokens to the entity that could demonstrate
foreknowledge of significant details of the actual event outcome.

Couldn't this be more general than just AP? Generalized it could be used
for any collectively rewarded effort but its main application looks like
anonymous conspiracy. This may be good, maybe not. What I was wondering
was if in a very generalized form the server might be "innocent," a mere
public bulletin board.

Also, couldn't a server like this be implemented as a distributed system
that could survive the destruction of some fraction of its body?

Again, I apologize for being slow but I do try.

Regards,
Mike
