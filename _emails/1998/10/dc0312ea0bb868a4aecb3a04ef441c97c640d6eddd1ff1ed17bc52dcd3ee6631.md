Sorry guy, no gettingout of dodge on this one.  There are no
utilities, no programs, no way out.  The only way to do this is to
copy the "mail file" which will be in the c:\notes\data directory and
blow away the id and recreate it.  Then after this, copy the mail file
back into the data directory.  This will recreate your desktop view
with the original folders and messages that you had.  Otherwise,
you're screwed.
