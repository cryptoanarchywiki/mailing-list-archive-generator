Located nearby at http://www.nsa.gov:8080/docs/efoia/released/jfk.html are 
documents related to the Kennedy assassination.  Check out the COMINT 
reports, they were getting information from an awful lot of interesting 
sources, many of which appear to be telegrams or telexes or similar
communications.  The Truman memo may show the background behind Echelon,
but these things show it (or at least its ancestor) in action.  Wow.
