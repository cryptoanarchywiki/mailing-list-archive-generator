Does anyone know how ITAR applies to cryptographic source code which can
not directly be used to encrypt or decrypt files?

Specifically, do we need to do some horrible export-controlled thing for
source code which contains a very straightforward reference implementation
of DES, and whose output is a file of integers defining a satisfiability
problem instantated for a specific plaintext/ciphertext pair? 

If the answer to this question is "yes," would someone be willing to
donate a few meg on an export-controlled crypto site that we could link
to?

Many thanks.
