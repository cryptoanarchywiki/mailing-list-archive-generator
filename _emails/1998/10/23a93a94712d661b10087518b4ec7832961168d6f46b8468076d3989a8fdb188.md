Yeah, they're definately racist - they have a thing against left-handed
nocturnal diseased marsupials. They haven't donated any money to me. 
OTOH, I haven't donated any money to Howard University. 

How about you? Have you donated money to Howard University? I'll bet you've 
donated more money to Micro$oft ... Which side are you on, anyway ... ??

Since you're local to the aforementioned institution, how about looking 
into whether Howard U have any merit to their claims? Does Micro$oft display 
racist hiring practices, or other discriminatory practices, other than 
failing to donate money to a particular institution?
