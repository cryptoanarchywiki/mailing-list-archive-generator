It is important to set clear guidlines and codes of practice for such
technological innovations, well in advance of the digital revolution
making new and unforseen opportunities to collate, analyze, recognise
and store such visual images. Such regulation will need to be founded 
on sound data protection principles and take cognizance of
article 15 of the European Data Protection Directive. Essentially it
says that:

"Member States shall grant the right of every person not to be subject
to a decision which produces legal effects concerning him or significantly
affects him and which is based solely on the automatic processing of
data".

The attitude to CCTV camera networks varies greatly in the European Union,
from the position in Denmark where such cameras ar banned by law to the
position in the UK, where you can find one of the most advanced CCTV network
coverage in Europe and where the issue of regulation and control have been
perhaps more developed then anywhere else.
