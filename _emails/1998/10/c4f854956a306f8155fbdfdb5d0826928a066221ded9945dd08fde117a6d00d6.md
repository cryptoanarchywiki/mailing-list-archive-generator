The assurance that privacy is safe and sound is too consistently
followed by the promise of a workable compromise between personal
privacy and the 'legitimate needs of law enforcement.' I'm not a lawyer
but I don't see any middle ground that accomodates both. Either the 5th
ammendment stands or it falls. What exactly are they planning? They talk
as if the groundwork has already been done and it's merely a matter of
following through. Watch for some wierd stuff tied to a barley crop
subsidy or an EPA appropriation.

Are there other examples of this speech from overseas?

Mike

I can think of only one phrase suited to describe a state where the
civil liberties are defined by the police agencies.
