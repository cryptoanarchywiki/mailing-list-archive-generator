Some people asked for more detail on the project I am working on, so I
have begun a quick write-up about it. A draft version is at the URL
below. This is just a sketch, and the document is fairly scrappy still,
but I thought it would be worth asking for comments at this stage
anyway. So, flame away.

(Yes, it's an acrobat doc. Apologies for the somewhat awkward format
here.)

Cheers,
Frank O'Dwyer.
