You can accomplish the same thing by encrypting your private key (including
RSA) with a passphrase and publishing it.

Because of the problems with passphrase bruting, it probably only
makes sense to do this with a machine-generated passphrase which has
guaranteed entropy.  Something like: "Aarhous mocrader Fals paca rate
portion wiserustingned" has a guaranteed > 128 bits of entropy, which
should be enough for most purposes.  Probably with an hour's study most
people could memorize such a passphrase.
