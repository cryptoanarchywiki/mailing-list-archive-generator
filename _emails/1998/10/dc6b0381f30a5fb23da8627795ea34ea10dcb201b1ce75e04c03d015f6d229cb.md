   NOW - THE ATOMIC CHIP

     Scientists at the Technical University of Denmark said today they have
created an atom-sized computer chip, in which a single hydrogen atom
jumping to and fro generates a binary code. And the technique operates at
room temperatures. It means a million CDs could fit onto one disc. But it
is not expected to become commercial for some years. The university's
Microelectronics Centre, which carried out the research, is at
http://www.mic.dtu.dk
