For now. What's the curve on facial recognition for 2x improvement?

It would seem probable to me that there would be a feature to snap closeups
off the cameras and feed them back in real-time. Talk about real-time traffic
analysis.

I'll have to disagree.

Um, it was always legal and should continue to be so, just as it should be
legal for you or I to stand around that corner and watch for unusual
activity. It's there job. They call it walking the beat.

I don't know about citizen-accessible. I don't want some joe blow walking
down the street to get access to the cameras that track my trek to work each
day. No, it needs to be very limited and require full interaction of the
courts to gain access. Simply putting on a police uniform (or a army
uniform) shouldn't mean you give up your rights as a citizen.

This may be hard to believe, but I'm not the state's nigger and neither is
that police officer or soldier.
