Jim Choate then proceeds for several hundred lines without 
producing a single line of evidence that these markets were 
monopolistic, indeed without ever giving the slightest hint 
as to what markets he is referring to, or naming the evil 
folk who supposedly monopolized them, or even telling us what
era he is talking about. 

If real monopolies had ever existed at any time or any place
except by state intervention, Jim would be able to provide
some concrete examples.  He has not provided any examples.
Indeed he deliberately avoids the concrete, because he knows
that if he named a particular identifiable alleged
monopolist, such as the famous Standard Oil, he would be
instantly shot down with concrete statistics about market
share, price cuts, and profit margins.
