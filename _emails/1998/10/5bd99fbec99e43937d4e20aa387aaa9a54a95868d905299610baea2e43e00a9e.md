this guy knows this is a mailing list by the way he forged the from header. 
he knew the administrator address for the list.   Quick anti-spam note  by
looking at the received header all the way on the bottom of all of them we
see that the originating host was:
a modem slip account from detroit michigan on the at&t service.

that is about the best we can do as far as establishing this persons
identity, but a copy of the message including the headers forwarded to abuse
or postmaster @att.net of the message will have the problem resolved in no
time.  If everyone takes 2 min to do this it will definiately get the
account removed.  I guess I just do this for revenge though.  It is fun
getting all of the cancellation notices in your e-mail.'
