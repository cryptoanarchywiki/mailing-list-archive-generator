Monozygotic [maternal] twins do have the same DNA. Hence they are
identical. Genetically identical that is, there are non-genetic
variations. Dizygotic [fraternal] twins do not. Fraternal twins can be
visually nearly identical, but they are not genetically identical.

Clones on the otherhand and have identical nuclear DNA, but are not
necessarily identical because some early development processes rely on
maternal genome material and not nuclear DNA, and depending on the
cloning process they may have different mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).
