A distinguishing feature of the complaints and indictments
of suspects in the African Embassy bombings is the
use of the phrase "in the special maritime and territorial
jurisdiction of the United States, as that term is defined in
Title 18, United States Code, Section 7(3), and outside 
the jurisdiction of any particular state or jurisdiction," to 
apparently lay claim to the legal right of the US to arrest 
and imprison terrorist suspects for acts in any location 
where US law customarily would not be valid:

Would any of our legal advisors know the origin of that 
phrase "outside the jurisdiction of any particular state or 
jurisdiction?" Is this new, and devised to reduce conflict
with other states who may harbor terrorists, or perhaps
prevent them from being terrorist targets for cooperating
with the US?
