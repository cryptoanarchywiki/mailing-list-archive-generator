Hmmm.  You imply that the employees and employers interests are not
the same.  The whole idea is to make a profit.  Out of those
profits the employees are payed the salaries they use to keep
their families in beer and bedclothes.  What other sort of interest
do you suggest the company should have?  They already get significant
benefits in insurance etc.  Many employees already have the option
to buy shares.  Certainly this is the case in publically traded
companies -- many publically traded companies offer these same
shares at a discount to employees.  

Any other sort of interest would simply induce a market distortion
in the cost of investment capital.

The market detects socialism as damage and routes around it.

The entire market would never do this voluntarily, so by definition any
distortion would have to be induced in a centrally managed economy.

By definition socialism.

But look at the bright side.  We already have people who think
they can centrally manage the economy.  They've certainly made
inroads.
