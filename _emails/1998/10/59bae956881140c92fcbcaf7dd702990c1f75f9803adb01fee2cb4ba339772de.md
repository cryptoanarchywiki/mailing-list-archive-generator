ahhh, so when you say "cypherpunks write code" that also
means articles and other writings too????

so you can be a cypherpunk by writing a lot of stuff ABOUT
cypherpunks code????

but just cause you write the code or text, that's only
one part of the equiation, right???

in other words is david chaum a cypherpunk????
