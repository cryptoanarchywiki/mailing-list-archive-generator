What about the difference in twins being that one can be from two ovum
and two sperm??  Did you ever think of that??  Thus a brother and sister
that are twins?  Maybe you are one of said twins two eggs two sperm...

Is if fraternal VS paternal twins?  I forget...
or maternal VS paternal??   Maybe paternal two sperms maternal the egg
split twice... High School Biology was so long ago and I do computers
now, not biology or medicine.
