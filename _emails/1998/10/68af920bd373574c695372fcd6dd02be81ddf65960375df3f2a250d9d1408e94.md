Ken Brown wonders about this phrase:

"Soccer moms" are the suburban mothers who efficiently perform any
number of child-rearing tasks, including taking their kids in a
sports utility vehicle (an awful invention) to soccer practice.
Soccer is increasingly popular and available to girls as well as
boys.  Women in general favored Clinton, and soccer moms in
particular are the women most likely to vote... since they're doing
everything else, working in a trip to the polls is nothing to them.

Probably sounds as arcane as "Sloane Rangers" does over here, eh?
