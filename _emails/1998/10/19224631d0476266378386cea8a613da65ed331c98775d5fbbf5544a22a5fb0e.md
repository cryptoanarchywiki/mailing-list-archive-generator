As I remember the case two women kidnapped and sexualy assaulted a
hitchhiker. Their defence was that it wasn't possible to rape man against
his will. The jury found them guilty of the charge.

I don't have a lot of spare time right now (I've had 3 full days off in the
last 6 weeks and have to work Sunday) so I am unable to follow up and
find the specifics.

If nobody happens to remember it we might table it until I can get the time
to find the specifics.
