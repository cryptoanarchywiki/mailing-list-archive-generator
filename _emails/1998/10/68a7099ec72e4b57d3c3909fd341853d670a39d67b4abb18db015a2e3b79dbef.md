Subject: Will 'Net Ballots Supplant Congress?

          WILL DIRECT DEMOCRACY PRE-EMPT SOME OF CONGRESS'S POWER?
                 Questions Remain about Implementation

ActivMedia Research (http://www.activmedia.com) - Two of three Internet
afficionados think online elections are a good idea (66% to 33%). The same
proportion would like to be able to vote on ballot referenda and exercise
direct democracy via the 'Net (67%).

"Obviously, the technical ability to move toward direct democracy must be
accompanied by debate about its merits and what is an appropriate level of
technocratic and professional decision-making on our behalf," notes
ActivMedia's Director of Information Services Chris Anne Wheeler. "Some
laws are best implemented by professionals for the public good such as
environmental protection, national defense, and public welfare. But
virtually all online consumers polled in ActivMedia's FutureScapes agree
that a sunshine policy making legislative bills, voting records, and
budgets available online for public inspection would be a good idea (97%)."

Survey respondents with 4+ years of online experience the greatest
propensity to want to vote online. As expected, younger (under 15) as well
as older (over 65) 'Netizens show a somewhat higher resistance to carrying
out civic responsibilities online. The conservatives in the Northeast show
a slightly greater resistance especially when it comes to voting for
elected officials (63%), but essentially the desire to vote online is
favored by the majority no matter their demographic background.

All across the country, websites are cropping up that help voters weed
through the oftentimes overwhelming amount of information on candidates and
issues. The greatest challenge for voters is tracking down objective
nonpartisan sources of candidate information. Trials of online voting are
scarce as policy-makers grapple with issues of fraud and security.
