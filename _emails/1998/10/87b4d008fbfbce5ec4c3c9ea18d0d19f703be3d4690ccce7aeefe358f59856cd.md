- Scumbag
Interesting terminology... :- ) I got this nifty little slang dictionary which has this word in it...
"Dictionary of Contemporary Slang" by Tony Thorne... ISBN 1-85980-003-3 [on the back of the dic] and it's worth 12.99 in 
British pounds :- ) Published in 1994

A CIP entry for this book is available from the British Library
Printed in Britain by Clays Ltd, St. Ives plc
ISBN 0 7475 1735 5 [on the second page]

Comments on back of book: More than 5,000 racy and raffish colloquial expressions - from Britain, America, the Caribbean, 
and other English-speaking places.
'Fascinating. Certainty a book I shall want to keep on trucking with.' Daily Mail
'Wonderfully informative.' Observer
------------------------------------
Definition of 'fucking': adjective
an intensifier used with other adjectives to emphasis. Like "bloody" it is also one of the very few examples of an 'infix' [a word 
component inserted before the stressed syllable in the middle of a polysyllabic word] in English.
    e.g. 'Jesus, it's f****** cold in here.'
    e.g. 'Abso-fucking-lutely.'

Definition of 'scumbag': noun, [origin] American
a deceptive person. This term of abuse is now widespread and is permitted in the broadcast media, in spite of the fact that its 
origin, unknown to many of its users, is as an obscene phemism for condom, 'scum' being an obsolescent American term for 
semen. The word was adopted by British speakers around 1985.
    e.g.. 'Even scumbags have right here in the USA.' [Red Heat, US film 1988]

PS: If I remember correctly, the main actors in Red Head were James Belushi, and Arnold Swatznager [something like that]....
