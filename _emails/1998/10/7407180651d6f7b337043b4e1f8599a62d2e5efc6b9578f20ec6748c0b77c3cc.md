Why not encrypt the private key with a 128 bit symmetric key (created from the hash of a username and paasword)
and store on a keyserver, along with the public key?
That way, you don't have to store it yourself locally, you get it off the keyserver.
I wrote a keyserver that does just that.  In addition, it also verifies ies the user before returning the key.
It requires the user to encrypt a known string with a separate password.
The encrypted string is sent to the keyserver, encrypted with the keyserver's public key.
Seems rather safe. Anyone disagree?

P.S. I might not use it for military purposes, but for company email...
