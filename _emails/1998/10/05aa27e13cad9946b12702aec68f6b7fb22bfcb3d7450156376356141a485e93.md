Read RFC 1123, section 5.2.3. 

      5.2.3  VRFY and EXPN Commands: RFC-821 Section 3.3

         A receiver-SMTP MUST implement VRFY and SHOULD implement EXPN
         (this requirement overrides RFC-821).  However, there MAY be
         configuration information to disable VRFY and EXPN in a
         particular installation; this might even allow EXPN to be
         disabled for selected lists.

         A new reply code is defined for the VRFY command:

              252 Cannot VRFY user (e.g., info is not local), but will
                  take message for this user and attempt delivery.

         DISCUSSION:
              SMTP users and administrators make regular use of these
              commands for diagnosing mail delivery problems.  With the
              increasing use of multi-level mailing list expansion
              (sometimes more than two levels), EXPN has been
              increasingly important for diagnosing inadvertent mail
              loops.  On the other hand,  some feel that EXPN represents
              a significant privacy, and perhaps even a security,
              exposure.

VRFY is hardly an "incorrect SMTP command."
