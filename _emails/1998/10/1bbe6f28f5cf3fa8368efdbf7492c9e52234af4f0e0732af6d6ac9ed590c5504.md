Hi,

Here is the note that I made regarding the saturation of free market
economies.

Note that this is several months old and I haven't been diligent in keeping
it fully up to date...

>  -  the commen assumption by current free market models that consumers
>     are rational is irrational. A consideration of succesful marketing
>     mechanisms and human psychology will clearly demonstrate that
>     consumers are at best partialy rational. This is the fault in all
>     anarchy models (eg crypto-anarchy), they assume in an axiomatic

>     sufficient recognition that these may in many cases be in conflict.
>     It is the same failing every form of government without a clear and
>     proscribed list of individual and state rights and limits has, the
>     assumption that some minimal set of behaviours or goals will satisfy
>     all participants in all cases. The theory 'What is best for all is
>     best for the one' is false.

>     term best interest. Therefore the distinction between rational and
>     irrational consumers is false.

>  -  the market is saturated, in other words the number of consumers at
>     any given time are equal to or less than the service providers ability
>     to provide that service (or resource). This means the long-term survival
>     of firms is a function of retained market share and raw resource share
>     control/ownership.

>     and implimentation standards required to do business with the more
>     succesful of these providers.
> 
>  -  an individual or small group of service providers have a small but
>     distinct efficiency advantage in technology, manufacturing, or
>     marketing. Over a long-enough time this market advantage will grow
>     and as a result widen the 'technology gap' between firms.
> 
>  -  expect the most efficient firms to share their profit with the
>     critical intellectual contributors. This further reduces the
>     problem of cross-communication and new provider start-up.
> 
>  -  expect to see the more successful providers to join in co-ops with

>     develop new technology due to resource starvation.
>
