That's what worries me, once the snowball gets rolling... I mean jeesh, I
run a program that handles email. This sort of stuff is exactly why I don't
like interacting with people via private email unless I know them personaly
(ie via non-electronic means). The software is publicly available and
certainly doesn't need me to explain it. While I can see some interest in
wanting to know what CJ/Toto/aka said to me that night on the phone and the
next day at the physical meet, it makes me wonder exactly what am I
*supposed* to know about...

Ahmen. Though a more insidous threat is the 'network' that gets built out of
it. I wonder if this means every time some bozo I happen to run across goes
postal I'm going to be 'investigated'? I wonder how long a name stays on
those (probably) non-existant lists?

That was the ultimate reason that I went ahead and posted it. That way
somebody *besides* me knew about it.

Which is the reason I'm talking to a lawyer to find out specificaly what is
going on. I mean in my own self interest and the continued existance of
TAG:SSZ it seems to be the thing to do. As far as I know I won't have access
to council once I'm in there.
