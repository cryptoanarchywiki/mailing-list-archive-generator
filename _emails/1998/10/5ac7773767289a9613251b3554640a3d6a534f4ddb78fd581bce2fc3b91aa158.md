I have provided specific examples from history.  You have
told us that various undefined markets in unspecified places
at unspecified times were monopolized by unspecified big
companies.

If these monopolies were rampaging all over the place, your
really should be able to name them, and show that specific
named monopoly companes were able to extract specific
identified monopoly profits.

In what country?  Ruritania?

What was the name of the evil monopoly that dominated the
meat processing industry?

What were their excess profits?

And if they were making excess profits, what stopped any man
and his dog from setting up in business cutting up cattle?

(Unless, of course, it was the government that stopped any
man from slaughtering cattle.)
