...and I was just thinking the other day it would be cool to create a
government blocking service maintaining a list of disallowed IPs and
providing a click-thru redirect agreement complete with legal
enforcement. ;)

[There *is* a cyberia connection in here, somewhere, I think.]

I'm sure you all (in the U.S., at least) have heard of the murdered
Tennessee state senator, and that his opponent in the upcoming election
is now charged with the crime.

Well, turns out that the boys aren't just from anywhere in TN, but from
Putnam County, home of the cookie-monster suit between the local guvvies
and the Putnam Pit <http://www.putnampit.com/>.  So, always interested
in alternative viewpoints, thought I'd see what the Pit had to say, in
it's own inimitable way.  Found that its home page now says what
follows. Thought it might interest some, for reasons unrelated to the
alleged crime.
