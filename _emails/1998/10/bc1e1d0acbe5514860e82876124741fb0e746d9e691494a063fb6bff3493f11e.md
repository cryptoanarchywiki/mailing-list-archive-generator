You mean to tell me that the GOV is actually going to try to make a
case against someone on *this* mailing list for sending threatening
mail?  Gimme a break!  Have you actually perused any archives of
this list?  If you did, and filtered out any of the crypto/privacy-relevant
posts, you'd be hard pressed to find *anything* that you could take
seriously at all, let alone construe to be threatening.  Unless of course
you take space aliens hiding your drugs to be threatening.

And what, you're from the IRS?  What, was the IRS threatened?  And
this would surprise you how?  Did they threaten to hide the IRS' drugs?
Were they posing as space aliens?  And how come you didn't contact
me?  Does that mean that I'm under investigation?  Or do you just not
like me?  Or were you not sniffing my network connection at the time
to make your illegal determination that I'm on the Cypherpunks mailing
list?

I'd have to agree with Mr. 'X' that you guys have a lot of nerve coming
to this list and asking for assistance in what's probably an illegal
and illegitimate investigation in the first place, looking to claim another
victim in the seemingly never-ending destruction of the rights
of the common man by the faceless fascist government regime.

Or, to sum up, piss off.
