I'm not talking about whether the FBI/NSA is setting us up
politically; they may very well be doing just that.  The point
is that we need to win wars by winning battles, but it's hard
to win battles by sticking to absolute principles and eventually
third parties looking no longer find you credible.  If we can
stick to pointing out just how similar GAK/KR is to cameras in
every bedroom, then we can win the battles and the war.  If
we just stick to either we get 100% of what we want or we
don't want it, then the FBI/NSA can manipulate the public into
thinking that we would never agree to anything the FBI/NSA
wants.

Remember ... we don't have what we want yet ... despite
some of the rhetoric on this list, and the FBI/NSA is trying to
win a war of attrition.
