Well, as long as we're comparing languages, let me throw in German.

In German we have this concept called "schadenfreude," which basically
means "delight at the misfortune of others."

Or, more Calvinistically, delight that the chickens have come home to
roost, that evolution is indeed working, and that people are getting what
they earned.

I see it all around me. Keeps me going.
