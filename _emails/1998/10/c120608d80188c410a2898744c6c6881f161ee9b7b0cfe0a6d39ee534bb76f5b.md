Subject: Technological Visions: Utopian and Dystopian Perspectives

CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT:

Technological Visions: Utopian and Dystopian Perspectives

A USC Annenberg Center for Communication convened by the Annenberg
Schools for Communication, University of Southern California and the
University of Pennsylvania

November 6 and 7, 1998 Davidson Conference Center, University of
Southern California

Technological Visions: Utopian and Dystopian Perspectives will bring
together journalists, academics, cyberculture advocates,
policymakers, and science fiction visionaries to examine how
technologies have been envisioned throughout history and the social
impact of new technologies. The conference will explore ways of
considering contemporary new technologies in light of how new
technologies were represented and debated in the past. It intends to
address the ahistorical nature of the public discourse of new
technology and to encourage discussion across the boundaries of the
social realms of academic, media, and industry on the impact of new
technologies.

Sherry Turkle, Professor of Sociology of Science at MIT and author
of Life on the Screen will give the keynote speech: Are the
discourses surrounding the Internet a better guide to social action
than those formulated in the early days of "old" technologies? Have
we learned anything from the successes and failures of past attempts
to predict what technology will do for us and to us?

Panels:

The Problems and Potentials of Prediction
Privacy and Censorship
