Don, Ted:

I guess I owe you guys lunch. Who would have thought
the Vikings would beat Green Bay!!  Aaarghh!

Since you guys are so clever when it comes to picking
winners maybe you should put some money on the
line for Sunday's games!

I found a great new casino and sportsbook!!
Check it out!

Click Here

You can bet on college and NFL games at their
sportsbook or play blackjack, poker, craps, 
slots or baccarat in the casino.

Guys, its AWESOME. There's no software
to download and you can place your bets
by telephone OR over the Internet!!

Try it out. You can set yourself up on-line at:

P.S. Call me crazy guys, but I actually bet on the
Vikings and made over $ 120.00 Thanks for the tip!!
Remember...
