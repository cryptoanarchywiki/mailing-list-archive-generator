I don't speak up here much but I can't let this go: the next time you hear
William Buckley on the Commonwealth Club broadcast on NPR, or hear the
almost-commercial-broadcast-length squibs that pretend to be underwriter
attributions but which are really tiny little commercials for ADM
"Supermarket to the World" or Wells Fargo "Making Your Time Count," ask
yourself who NPR is really working for, and set your expectations
accordingly.  Then send your checks to Pacifica to support free-speech
radio.
