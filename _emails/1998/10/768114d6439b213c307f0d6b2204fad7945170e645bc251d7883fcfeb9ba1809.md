	That does not apply to very many business at all. Most are rather
heavily regualted, and state regulations in some places can be extremely
onerous.

	Unless you have a partner, or an employee, or a need to incorporate.

	Crap. In most cases monopolies are GIFTS from the government, where
they  aren't they are either (a) natural monopolies (were the market is too
small to support competition, or there is some other feature of that market
which makes competition difficult or undesirable) there aren't too many of
these, or places where the government (city, state, fed) felt a monopoly
would be of benefit to the citizens. I.e. Gas/power/light companies,
Telephones etc.

	The government was (as usual) wrong.

	France, England etc.

	We are _going_ that route, with more and more regualtion being
dumped on the backs of businesses daily.

	If you think that registering a DBA is the only step you need to
_legally_ start and run a business, you're smokin crack.

	If there were no food regulations, would you eat at Mc Donalds?

	Like...Operating systems? Nope, Linux is NO competition for NT,
neither are the free BSDs.

	Why shouldn't it go both ways? In a healthy market, the consumers
ARE the manufacturers.
