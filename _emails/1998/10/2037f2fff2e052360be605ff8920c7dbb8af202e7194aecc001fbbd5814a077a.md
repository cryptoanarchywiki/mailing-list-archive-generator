Which to have *any* impact implicity requires a commen understanding of what
Juliet was saying within the context of human society and *not* personal
ego. From that point it's only a question of what literary technique (eg
irony or allegory) was Perry the person using. That technique will define
the constraints on what Perry can say, not Perry's desire to say anything in
particular.

It will always come back to what the base definitions of a word are in a
given language-culture milieu. Yes you can play with it but *only* within
the context of that language. To do otherwise breaks the syntax-symantics
connection and creates another language entirely (or more likely gibberish).
