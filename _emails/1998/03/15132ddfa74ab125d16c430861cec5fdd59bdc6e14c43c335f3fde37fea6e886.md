Has anyone ever taken a look at Cryptologic (www.cryptologic.com)?  They make Internet casino software and processed 
500 million dollars in bets last year with their 'Proprietary' encryption algorithm for security and their own ecash system.

You'd think with that much money being transmitted over the net with an untested algorithm, someone might just 
test the situation for them....

Maybe someone already has, and doesn't feel like making it public?

Who knows...
