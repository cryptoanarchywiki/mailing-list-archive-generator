  Bill Frantz is *really* Vulis.
  Bill Stewart is *really* Toto.

  Both are charter members, along with Bill Clinton and Bill Gates,
of a secret society of people named Bill who plan to form a new
world government and declare the Buffalo Bills to be the real
Superbowl Champions by an act of legislation.

  I am truly amazed that a seemingly intelligent group of individuals
such as the CypherPunks cannot see the blatantly obvious connections
between the Bills and the TMs who are warring for control of our
minds.
