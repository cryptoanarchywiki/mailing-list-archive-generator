seat of Blair in the next Federal election.

Full press release details can be seen at:

http://www.gwb.com.au/onenation/press/270298.html

Some Internet addresses to keep an eye on:
==========================================
"I'm so, so sorry Pauline"

While everybody else is getting in on the "Sorry" act the treatment being
meted out to Pauline Hanson by the media deserves an apology to our
favourite lady.

Here you can send an email to a moderated web page on which messages of
apology and comfort are posted to show support for the valuable work that
Pauline Hanson is doing to take Australia back from the brink.

The Australian National News of the Day: 

A daily on-line paper which follows the history of One Nation. With an
extensive archive dating back over two years (archive available to subscribers)

------------------------------------------------
The four corners of Australia's Trojan Horse:

See how the Australian media are misrepresenting the news and distorting the
truth to discredit Pauline Hanson with their willing partners the ALP and
the Liberal party.
References are taken from press articles that have run in the mainstream media.

Let us remember it was the ALP and the Coalition who allowed Rupert Murdoch
(an American) and Kerry Packer to gain the hold that they have today on our
media.

See what they get in return for these favours.

Finally, as we approach the federal election we will be calling on
volunteers to assist in mail drops etc... please get your friends and family
to subscribe to this news letter so that we can keep them informed on how
they can help Pauline and her team turn Australia around.

REMEMBER only PEOPLE POWER is going to keep Australia **One Nation**. 

That means ALL OFF YOU!! D O   I T    N O W !!!!


GWB
