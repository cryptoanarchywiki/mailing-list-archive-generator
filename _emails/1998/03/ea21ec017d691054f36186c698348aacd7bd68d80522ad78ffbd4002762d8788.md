* In a September issue of New Scientist magazine, researchers in
Germany wrote that a type of hermaphroditic flatworm mates
through what they call "penis fencing."  In the presence of another,
a worm lashes out with its penis to attempt to inject sperm, but the
potential mate might have similar ideas itself, and in bouts that last
up to an hour, each attempts to inseminate the other.  Often both
worms are left severely punctured.
