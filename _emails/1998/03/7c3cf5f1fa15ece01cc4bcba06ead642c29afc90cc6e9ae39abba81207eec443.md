Taipei, Taiwan:

Taiwan's high-tech "peeping Toms" may have met their match in the form of a
pocket-sized device designed to detect pornographers' hidden cameras.

The "Discovery I" device, which resembles a pager, detects radio waves
emitted by the wireless remote-control cameras that criminal groups have
installed some hotel rooms, toilets and department store fitting rooms to
spy on unsuspecting patrons.

Pictures taken by such cameras of couples having sex or women trying on
garments are widely available in Taiwan's underground pornography market.

"Hopefully this device can give people more assurance when they are in
public establishments," said a representative for Series Technology, which
launched the detector Tuesday.

Several cases have come to light in Taiwan in recent weeks in which people
have bought pornographic videotapes, only to discover themselves as the
featured attraction.

Police are cracking down on the illegal practice, using far more
sophisticated scanners, and have made numerous arrests.
