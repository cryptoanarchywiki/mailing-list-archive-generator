Well said William, very well said.  Free men must cooperate in their
own defeat, refuse to cooperate, refuse to give in, and you will not
lose.  In the end, tyranny will fall.

In the history of our civilizations, all governments have eventually
failed, regardless that they may have had noble intent in their
beginnings, and they have fallen.  So have each succeeding government
after them. They fail because when times passes, decades or centuries
(doesn't matter) the average citizenry becomes accepting and
complacent while said government becomes more and more abusive,
excessive, impulsive, and corrupt.  Finally, those people who can no
longer tolerate this from those who would call themselves their
rulers, rise to the occasion and the now festering, malignant
government is torn down.

Unfortunately, the cycle repeats itself.  The U.S. government has
lasted this long only due to the freedoms guaranteed by our
Constitution, but it still has been following in the tracks as all the
previous governments before it.  In lasting longer than any other
constitutional form of government, it is now so corrupt that at this
point only 1 of 2 things can really happen:  a 2nd American
Revolution, and hopefully a new start and (for the time being) a
change for the better, or total Fascism, and the last remaining
freedoms people have will be quickly extinguished.  I don't want to
live in a socialist environment.  I don't want somebody telling me how
to raise my children, and I don't want someone telling me I'm a
criminal because I don't want to let the government read what I have
to say.  It doesn't "Take a Village" and it doesn't take Big
Brother.... it takes freedom, ingenuity, drive, determination,
self-worth, cooperation, and dedication to build something better.

Scream to your Senators and Representatives, as loud as you can, we
all must do what we can, or we will be lost, and as William said, in
perpetual, permanent slavery, with no privacy, no rights, and no hope
for a self-determined future.  To hell with that.

Eric J. Tune
