QUICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------

To assure that someone else cannot obtain a Digital ID that contains your 
name and e-mail address, you must retrieve your Digital ID from
VeriSign's secure web site using a unique Personal Identification
Number (PIN). 

Be sure to follow these steps using the same computer you used to
begin the process.

Step 1: Copy your Digital ID PIN number. 
Your Digital ID PIN is: 7278ce06ea0aedffb942b1b7468471a3

Step 2: Go to VeriSign's secure Digital ID Center at
https://digitalid.verisign.com/getid.htm

Step 3: Paste (or enter) your Digital ID personal identification
number (PIN), then select the SUBMIT button to install
your Digital ID.

That's all there is to it!
