A note to Cypherpunks:

Today I was sent a missive ostensibly from Mr. Toto.

Following are the particulars:

[begin quote]

Return-Path: <toto@sk.sympatico.ca>
Received: from harrier.sasknet.sk.ca (harrier.sasknet.sk.ca 
[142.165.5.2]) by camel10.abraxis.com (8.8.5/8.8.5) with ESMTP id 
XAA02654 for <camcc@abraxis.com>; Mon, 16 Mar 1998 23:42:42 -0500 
(EST)
Received: from uymfdlvk (regnsk01d05020132.sk.sympatico.ca 
[142.165.24.84]) by harrier.sasknet.sk.ca (8.8.6/8.8.6) with SMTP 
id WAA21157;
Mon, 16 Mar 1998 22:40:54 -0600 (CST)
Message-ID: <350E1A48.6C00@sk.sympatico.ca>
Date: Mon, 16 Mar 1998 22:38:01 -0800
From: Toto <toto@sk.sympatico.ca>
Reply-To: toto@sk.sympatico.ca
To: Replay Anonymous remailer <remailer@REPLAY.COM>

[end quote]

For health reasons I removed myself from the list several months 
ago; now it appears the errors of my youth have returned to haunt 
me.

I had assumed either the RCMP, CIA, FBI, KGB, ASPCA, or some 
other local authority had plucked Toto from the Web.

Alas, this latest message, SAHMD -- Prologue 8/0, indicates the 
torment continues unless, of course, it is a forgery. But then, 
Mr. T. has been known to forge messages he has signed and send 
them direct with screwed up Anon: headers.

This must stop. Whom should I contact to complain about such 
harrassment?

My head is hurting again for the first time in months.

Alec
