The New Yorker magazine of March 9 has a long shattering
essay on Ken Alibek, the former Soviet bioweapons expert,
William Patrick, the US's counterpart, the state of Russian 
secret bioweapons development, and prospects for the spread
and use of this WMD.

It's far more disturbingly detailed than the New York Times 
and ABC PrimeTime reports, and presents a horrific spectrum of 
gruesome details of nearly unimaginable catastrophe fermenting 
in secret laboratories and deepest black storage tanks.

If you thought nuclear weapons were terrifying, read this for a
shocking introduction to evil which will give even thermonuclear
warriors nightmares of helplessness.

Where Strangelovian physicists once ruled, now reign Mad
microbiologists.

Richard Preston is the writer, featured on PrimeTime and
author of The Hot Zone, on the Ebola virus.

For those without easy access to the magazine we offer a
copy:
