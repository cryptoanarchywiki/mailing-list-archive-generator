* The show business newspaper Daily Variety reported in December
that John Kricfalusi, creator TV's "The Ren & Stimpy Show," was
threatening legal action against the producers of the Comedy Central
show "South Park" for ripping off a cartoon character.  According to
Kricfalusi, his character "Nutty the Friendly Dump," an animated piece
of excrement, must have been the basis for "South Park"'s "Mr. Hankey
the Christmas Poo," a holiday-dressed, singing, dancing piece of
excrement.
