Your statement at

  There are two basic means of foiling any lock, from an automobile   
  ignition switch to a PAL: the first is to pick it, and the second is   
  to bypass it.

perhaps contains SEVERAL PRACTICAL oversights.

ONE is spike it!

And, of course, Pantex can always get in. 

Then there are OTHER ways of getting the key

  Two terrorist agents of the clerical regime, both high-ranking
officials in Tehran's     Evin Prison who have been directly involved in
the torture and execution of numerous     political prisoners in recent
years, are currently in Austria on a secret assignment as   special
guests of the Iranian embassy in Vienna. One of the two is Ruhollah,
  the notorious interrogator in Evin Prison's Branch 6. 

I read

  It is reasonably probable that public key cryptography is not used   
  directly. No known public key cryptosystem uses keys as short as 6 or
12 digits. 

I was told that public key was.

Here is the name and e-mail address of the fellow who told me
pubic key was used in the nuclear weapons ... and was being removed.

The supervisor of M Kent Parsons who told me it cost $300,000 each
to recall the nuke to Pantex to remove Sandia's FAILING CHIPS
[unspecified]
is

DJALLEN@sandia.gov

The guy, at 2300 department manager M Kent Parson's request who showed
me the about 112,000 lines of 1802 T1563 code is

DENMAN,THOMAS A.          (505)844-2819  TADENMA   (505)844-9524  0487 
TADENMA@sandia.gov 

I frequently see Denman when Morales and I meet at Taco Bell.

Let's ALL try to get the true story OUT THERE.

Best
