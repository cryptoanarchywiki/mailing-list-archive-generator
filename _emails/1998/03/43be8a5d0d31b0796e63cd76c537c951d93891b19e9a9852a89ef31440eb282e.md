What we are talking about, in terms of 3-lines of legally 
unexportable code, is 'Dick Wars'.
If one were to make certain that a wide range of members of Congress,
Senators, BXA and Department of Commerce officials, etc., were to
receive an email with a Subject: "I'm Pissing In Your EAR" and a
message body providing details of their crypto-miscreantizing, then
the inappropriate authorities would be hard-pressed to ignore the
stream (pardon the pun) of ridicule that would result in their
tyrannical, unconstitutional bluff being called.
