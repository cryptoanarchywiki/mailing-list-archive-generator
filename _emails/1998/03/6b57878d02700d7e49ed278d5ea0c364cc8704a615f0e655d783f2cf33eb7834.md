Did you know that over 125 Million people in the U.S. have checking
accounts? Out of those people over 70 Million DO NOT have a credit
card..

Now, YOU can tap into this huge customer base by using Checker.

Checker, a revolutionary new way to accept payment via fax, phone, 
or even e-mail is now available through TDN Publishing, Inc. for 
only $14.95 if you order before March 1.  Checker is a complete
check management system designed to speed up the ordering process
by enabling customers to fax or email payments rather than send via 
postal service (snail mail).  By expanding payment options,
businesses
can appeal to a larger array of customers, possibly resulting in
increased
sales.

Checker is a full featured check printing software package that will
allow
you to take your customers information and immediately print out a
check
that you can deposit the very same day!

IS CHECK-BY-FAX LEGAL?  Accepting a Check-by-Fax is not only cost 
effective and very simple, it IS PERFECTLY LEGAL!  Although the 
Internet offers "Secure Servers" for credit card purchases,
questions 
of safe electronic commerce remain.  many large companies who sell 
products or services on the Internet offer Check-by-Fax as a payment
option.

No more waiting to get paid. No more waiting for that "check in the
mail".

Checker will work with any inkjet or laser printer. You can use
inexpensive
check paper available at any print shop or simply use the paper you
use
every day.

Checker maintains a database of every check that you've printed and
it will
even print your own blank checks. No more ordering expensive refills
from 
the bank!

Checker is extremely user friendly and comes complete with a 
comprehensive support help file. It runs on any Windows 3.x or
Windows 95
computer.

Checker is shipped on a standard 3.5" diskette or can be sent as a
file
attachment to your E-mail address. Or you can download it from our
private site,
Your Choice!

Checker is now available to you through TDN Publishing for only 
 *** $14.95 ***.Similar check management systems can cost as  much
as
$200.00!!! Checker is ideal for individuals and businesses looking
to save
 money.

Thats right! Only $14.95 !!!!
