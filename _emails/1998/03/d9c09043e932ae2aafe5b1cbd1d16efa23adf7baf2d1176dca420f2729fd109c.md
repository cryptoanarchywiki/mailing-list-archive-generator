For those of you who missed the two-part forum on
encryption policy at UMBC, a videotape of each event
is available in the CSEE library in the ECS building at UMBC.
The first event featured John Gilmore (EFF) and Fritz Fielding 
(former NSA); the second featured Barry Smith (FBI).

These tapes are for viewing at UMBC only and are not
available for general distribution nor copying.
