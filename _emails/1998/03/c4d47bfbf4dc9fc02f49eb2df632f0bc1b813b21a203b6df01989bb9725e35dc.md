Somebody quoted PRZ's message about the NAI/PGP/TIS merger deal,
which puts to rest for now some of <my> concerns about the weird
juxtaposition of companies, anyway.  He didn't address the
issue of NAI becoming a KRAP again.

Just a formatting problem.  If you put a space before the "-Philip" the
message checks just fine.  There are several other copies of the message
posted around the Web already with the correct formatting, and the other
one I checked had the spacing right already (which is how I knew where to
look on this copy).  See, for example, the copy at http://jya.com .
