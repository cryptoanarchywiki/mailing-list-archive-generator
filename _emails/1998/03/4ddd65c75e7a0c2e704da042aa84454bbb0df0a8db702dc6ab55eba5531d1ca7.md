NYT-Markoff reports today on Biham and Knudsen's paper
on 3DES weakness, "Cryptanalysis of the ANSI X9.52 
CBCM Mode," noted here a few days ago.

The ANSI X9.F1 committee has held up implementing its
standard as a result, and may have to wait for AES. 
Credit is given to the worldwide DES crack.
