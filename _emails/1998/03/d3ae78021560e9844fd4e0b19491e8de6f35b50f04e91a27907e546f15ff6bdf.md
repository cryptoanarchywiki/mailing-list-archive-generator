The ECPA (Electronic Communications Privacy Act) banned cell phone
scanning, as of 1994 I believe. When Newt was monitored, that was nothing
really new.

Ch 83, (890-986?) is cell, however Federal law (Title 18, Chapter 119)
makes cell monitoring illegal only if it INTENTIONAL. And owning and
buying cell-phone capable devices is LEGAL. The only catch is who is
selling it, it is my understanding you can sell a cell scanner used
without a prob. I currently own a cell-capable scanner.
