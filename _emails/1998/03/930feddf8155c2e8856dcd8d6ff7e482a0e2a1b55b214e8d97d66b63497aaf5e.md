This is an automatic message to inform you that your email was not
forwarded through iName's server.

The iName email address that you tried to send mail to may not be active.
Reasons for the failed delivery attempt could include:

1. The iName customer has selected a new personalized iName email address
   rendering their old iName email address inactive.

2. The iName customer may have signed up for one of iName's free offers
   and then not validated their forwarding address.

3  The address may simply be typed incorrectly.  Please check that you
   typed the email address correctly.

iName provides email users with a permanent, personalized and secure email
address that is independent of how one accesses the Internet.  iName acts
as a global forwarding service.  All email sent to a permanent iName address
is automatically forwarded to a user specified destination email address.
Please visit iName's Online Support Area at
http://www.iname.com/info/intro/index.html for further information.

Here is the information on the $9 dental plan we talked about. I 
apologise for the delay in getting the information to you but I 
have been swamped for request. Please fax me if you want more 
information or wish to sign up.

I don't know what you're talking about; thought I'd let you know.

Your buddy
