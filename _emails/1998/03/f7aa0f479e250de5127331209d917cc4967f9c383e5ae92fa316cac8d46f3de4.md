Guys

When Sandia assigned me to break locks for the FBI/Engineering Research
Facility, project leader Peter Hamilton told me that if we got caught
there were judges who would help us.

I was not sure that I believe Hamilton then.  I do now.

Morales and I signed and mailed the petition for writ of prohibition
on the 18th

bill
