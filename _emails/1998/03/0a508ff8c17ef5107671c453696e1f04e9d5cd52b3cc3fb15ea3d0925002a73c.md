If you're a spammer, you're in no position to complain.

than actual spam.]

Complaints about spam are free speech, and by encouraging Internet providers
to increase the size of their networks, they're obviously commerce :-)

Anecdotes are just anecdotes; except during the occasional flame war about spam, 
I generally receive a lot more spam than complaints.  And at least the 
complaints have some creative thought behind them, unlike the spam...
				Thanks!
