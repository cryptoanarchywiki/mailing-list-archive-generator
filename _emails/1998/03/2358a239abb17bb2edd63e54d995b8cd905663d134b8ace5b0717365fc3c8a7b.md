Well, yes, that's what BXA flaunts, but I wonder if the encryption regs
are a high priority compared to the cases which are actually pursued
which deal with truly threatening technology that every congressperson
loves to fearfully hate. Yapping Chihuahua crypto is not up there yet, 
I suspect.

True, there's a batch of agents being trained to work specifically on
encryption, and with the total of crypto exports now exceeding $half a 
billion, it may be cost and politically effective to set an example by 
pounding one or two neo-crypto-Zimmermanns, especially as the
year's hearings rumble, troll and slumber.

Still, Adam's signature RSA-taunt has been on our Web site for months,
terminating each of his exemplary stream of messages on low perfidy 
in high places, to no effect on BXA's eagle eyeball.

Adam's 3-liner was also once part of Peter Junger's legal filings 
<http://jya.com/pdj4.htm> (DoJ downloaded the evidence) until we 
were ordered to excise the tiny terrible Perl so that Peter's noble 
bite of the hand of god would be clearly his stiletto fangs and not 
confused with Sir Adam Bulldog's ass ripper.

Now, Declan, what would a crypto-miscreant need to do to actually get 
BXA's fierce kennel of crypto bloodhounds' attention, to make it truly
worth everybody's headline read, money, politics, talents and teeth?

By Tuesday, when Cindy Cohn sticks her head in the beast's mouth.
