That's right. After glancing through some of the early posts to the
cypherpunks list one realizes that many of them had to walk ten miles
to get to a computer--always uphill and often in a blinding snowstorm.

That was back in the days when Americans still knew how to make a
big, high-powered car, but cypherpunks didn't use them to get to
their computers because they weren't namby-pamby momma's boys like
those godless commie A(h)OLs who get their peckers hammered on the
cypherpunks list and then complain because they can't get off.

Has anyone seen my shoes? I can't find my shoes...
