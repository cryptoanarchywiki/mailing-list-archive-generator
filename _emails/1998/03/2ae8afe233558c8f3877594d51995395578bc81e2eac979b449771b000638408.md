* JDesignerPro 2.5 Is For You
JDesignerPro 2.5 is an easy to use tool for developers to build and 
deploy data-driven business applications for the Web - Sales 
Management, Inventory Management, Help Desk, Customer Care, 
Decision Support, etc.  If you need to manage data through an Intranet, 
JDesignerPro is for you.  For many basic database applications, no 
knowledge of Java is required.

* Press Quotes
"If you're looking for a database development environment that 
leverages Java's finest virtues, JDesignerPro is it."  DBMS Magazine

"This may be one of JDP's biggest advantages for database developers 
who find themselves thrust into Java development: No Java 
programming is necessary. Developers can implement any standard 
functions simply by associating one component's method with another 
component's event."  InternetWorld magazine

* Microsoft Site Builder Network
Microsoft is one of our best partners and they've agreed to offer the 
new version 2.5 of JDesignerPro on the updated Site Builder Network.  
If you're a Site Builder member, you'll see BulletProof listed on the 
download area.  

* Major New Features of JDesignerPro 2.5

* FastSockets(tm) Technology in JAGGServer.  With BulletProof's 
innovative FastSockets you'll see substantial speed improvements 
of nearly 300% throughout the development and deployment 
processes.  FastSockets is a seamless integration requiring no 
effort on your part.  The included JAGGServer(tm) middleware 
handles JDBC/ODBC database access, load balancing and more.  
All SQL and server messaging is created automatically.

* Application Wizards -   The Screen Wizards are now part of the
Application Builder.  Build complete forms, charts, master/details 
70% faster than before.  

* Enhanced Data Wizards - Unprecedented speed, thanks to 
FastSockets, and ease in building complex data-aware interfaces.

* Year 2000 compliance - With the end of the millennium lurking 
JDesignerPro is fully year 2000 compliant. You can now easily 
specify your default date format. 

*  International Language Support - JDP now lets you customize the
interface to allow for different language support. This feature can 
also be used to customize the labels and messages of JDesignerPro 
to your needs. 

*  New component features - Several new features have been 
added to the existing JDesignerPro components such as date pop 
ups in the Text Grid again allowing you to create the most powerful 
finished application without any hand coding.
