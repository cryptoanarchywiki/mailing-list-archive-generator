 I would like to congratulate and thank you for the courageous stance
 that you have taken by doing your part to help stop the spread of 
 anarchistic and possibly illegal content on the InterNet by denying 
 access to those who use the freedom and rights granted them by the 
 Constitution to abuse those privileges.
 
   Your stance is particularly admired by those of us who share your
 interest in preventing the spread of free access to all types of 
 information <SNIP> concerning whether their assault on censorship and 
 censors should be consumated in CyberSpace or MeatSpace, there are few 
 who are willing to put themselves in the line of fire to support the 
 same ideals that other great Americans, such as Senator Joe McCarthy and 
 J. Edgar Hoover, have championed. >>

Ah yes, fits like a lock and a key.  Pro-censorship guys also being pro
McCarthy guys!  After all, these "Know-nothings" today, are the 'Modern
McCarthyites' (see my political page)
