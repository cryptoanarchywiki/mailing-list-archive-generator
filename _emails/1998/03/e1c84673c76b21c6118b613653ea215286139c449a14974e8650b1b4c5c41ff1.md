"They set 'em up. We knock 'em down. And here we are again."

	-Emily Whitfield, national ACLU spokeswoman, on the
	Internet censorship bill recently passed in New Mexico

Even though the Communications Decency Act was struck down by the Supreme
Court in the summer of 1997, New Mexico has just passed their own statewide
version of the infamous Internet censorship law.  Senate Bill 127, recently
signed by the governor of New Mexico, makes it illegal to place information
"harmful to minors" on the Internet where a person under 18 would be able
to access it.  The EFF and the ACLU have said they will fight the law in
court; the ACLU has already won lawsuits to overturn similar laws in four
other states.

If you know someone living in New Mexico, or if you live in New Mexico, we
need your help!  Peacefire is creating a "civil disobedience" page for
Internet users to protest the New Mexico law.  By filling out a form on our
Web site, a user will be able to click a button and automatically send a
Bible verse that mentions sex, or an excerpt on birth control from the
plannedparenthood.org Web page, to a Peacefire member under 18 living in
New Mexico.  These are the type of materials that would violate the
Communications Decency Act and New Mexico's S.B. 127.  Although the
volunteer living in New Mexico can simply delete the messages as they
arrive, it will still count as an act of civil disobedience for the user to
fill out the form that causes the message to be transmitted.

Please help us find someone living in New Mexico who could volunteer to
receive the automatic e-mails and delete them.  The number of e-mails
should be small (less than 10 per day), and they will all have the same
identical subject line so they will be easy to recognize and delete.  (If
the number of e-mails grows beyond that, we can have several volunteers.)
