All,

I cannot remember all of the equations that go into this, and only a very
simplistic approach follows, but ...

If your surge protector is a semi-conductor, it probably will be 
self-limiting.  That is, it will reach a maximum block, and pass
whatever is above that.  A Trans-sorb device, and those chemical ones, 
all limit what they do based upon a total absorption.  A lot of little
ones kills it the same as a single big one.  None of these tell you 
they are no longer operable.

However, if the UPS is properly built, it will have an inductor as the
leading serial device in a set of 'things'.  I would expect a set of
capacitors, in parallel with my load, on either side, appropriately 
sized.  The battery that makes the 'U' in the UPS acts like another
capacitor.  These act as fast as the spike, ALWAYS.  The sizes and number
of components requires some calculations (testing does NOT hurt, either).

Stan needs to review his basic electronics.  Yes, it will even protect
against lighting if designed for that purpose.  Costs vary accordingly ...
