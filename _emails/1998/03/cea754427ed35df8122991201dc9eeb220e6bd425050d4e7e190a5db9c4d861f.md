Jim,
Decoded the message from your post and will tell our friends in 
Las Vegas to release the _real_ anthrax as soon as possible.
It looks like the feds are going to hang the Olympic Park bombing
on rudolph, so it seems you have nothing to worry about.

p.s. - I agree with the point of your post, although I didn't really
    understand it.
