 See.. now.. you're clearly talking about power protection.. but, you see
 we _weren't_ talking about power outages, we were talking about
 compromising emanations being sent through power lines.. and as far
 as the UPS goes, whether or not a UPS would help such muffle such
 emanations. >>

Right.  That's why I pointed out that you shouldn't use a UPS and expect it to
prevent large surges (such as the type that occurs when lightning hits your
incoming power.

So, my statement was NOT stupid, your attack on it was.  :-)
