Recently we wrote you to tell about an excellent investment opportunity 
in JT's Restaurants (OTC BB: JTSR).  Since our last message was sent 
JTSR has risen in value over 40% (from Feb 17, 1998 to March 6, 1998).  
This is just the beginning.  This is still a ground floor opportunity.  
If you would like more information about this exciting investment 
opportunity please visit our web site at http://www.jtsr-stock.com or 
call 1-888-295-6365 for complete information.
