        Export Law Tested by Sale of Privacy Software

        SAN FRANCISCO -- An American maker of
        data-scrambling software said Thursday that it would
        circumvent U.S. export policies by allowing its Dutch
        subsidiary to begin selling an international version of Pretty
        Good Privacy, a strong encryption program that does not
        provide a back door for law enforcement surveillance. 

        Because the company, Network Associates, is the nation's
        largest independent maker of computer security software, its
        action could have a serious effect on U.S. export policies on
        software. 

        Network Associates' decision to sell a program specifically
        prohibited by the Commerce Department comes at a time when
        the Clinton administration is already fighting congressional
        attempts to end export controls on encryption software for fear
        that such restrictions will hurt the ability of American industry
        to compete internationally.
