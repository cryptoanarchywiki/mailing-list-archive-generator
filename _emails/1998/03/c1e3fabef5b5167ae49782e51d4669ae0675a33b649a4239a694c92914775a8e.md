                Hi, after adjusting claims for several insurance companies, I
found one thing the same.  No one seems to know much about what they are
entitled to.  So I decided to help the public towards even footing with 
insurance adjusters. 

                I have been a crusader for policyholder's rights for a good many
years since and received acclaim from state departments' of insurance 
and state Governors for my work, albeit obscure.  Anyway, you may want
to bookmark my "deserve" website just in case that rainy day happens to 
come your way.

               Socrates never sold insurance, but his words apply to this
industry as well:  "The only good is knowledge and the only evil is
ignorance."

                                                       Best wishes,

                                                       Tony Braga
