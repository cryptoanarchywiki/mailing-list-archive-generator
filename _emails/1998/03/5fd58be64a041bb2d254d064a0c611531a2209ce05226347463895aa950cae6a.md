  Back in the 'old days', when I had to walk ten miles, uphill,
in a blinding snowstorm, only to find that computers did not
exist yet, I was a founder of one of the first Canadian 
anti-nuclear grassroots organizations.
  Once the anti-nuke movement had progressed to the point  
where it was a viable entity, worthy of press coverage,
etc., the Canadian government began to 'recognize' the
legitimacy of the movement, and to 'fund' it (hee-hee).
  I went to the self-congratulatory celebration party held
by the members of the group I had founded who had managed
to line up at the government trough by abandoning their
ethics and values in favor of a government-mandated policy
of taking a 'reasonable' middle-road in the group's activities.
  I was there for eleven minutes. I spent the first five minutes
shoveling as much free food as humanly possible down my throat.
I spent the next five minutes draining every bottle of free
liquor in sight down my throat. I spent the next minute barfing
everything I had consumed all over the government representative
who was in attendance to make certain that everyone was toeing
the line and not saying 'bad things' about the Canadian government
or the Nuclear Power Industry.

Prologic Management Systems, Inc., bought Basis, Inc., in Berzerkeley
a couple years ago (considered by some to be the main lair of a 
secret organization dedicated to preventing the Evil One from using
computer technology to imprison the minds and souls of humankind).
My research indicated that Prologic was a spook-owned 'company killer'
which specialized in buying out and decimating companies who actually
had a capacity to resist the diabolical aims of the NWO.
When Network Associates bought PGP, I did similar research on NAI
and Network General, and came to the same conclusions.

  I have a friend in Arizona who asks me for investment advice, and
I recently told him to invest heavily in companies being acquired
by WorldComm.
  My rationalization for his investing heavily in companies in league
with the Anti-Christ was that, when Jesus comes back, he'll have 
enough money to buy him a meal and drinks at the best restaurant in
town, thus redeeming himself.

Whenever the government 'legitimatizes' any organization/product, it
is generally for the purpose of co-opting/fucking them.
The government uses the carrot-stick method on the citizen-animal.
First, it gives them the carrot/benefit for registering their identity
with the government (SSN#) and then it gives them the stick/buttfucking
once they are identified and categorized.
