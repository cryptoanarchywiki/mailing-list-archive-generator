Hi Stan,

A simple low pass filter made of 2 large inductors and a
few high voltage capacitors will do the trick nicely.
Which is not a slow reacting device being passive.
Combine this with polyswitch style protection and some method
of discharging a really high voltage to ground and it'll be
even better.

A very cheap design that should be in all UPS's.
And is certainly a whole lot better than nothing at all
for removing harzardous spikes, etc.
