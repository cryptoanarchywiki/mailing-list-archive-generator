The three new programs that are sweeping the industry.........

HURRICANE..Extremely fast.This extractor goes to major search engines (you can 
pick from a list of 10 of the most popular search engines) and conducts a search by 
keyword or keywords. It then spiders the web pages that come up as search results 
extracting the email addresses and saving them in a plain text format. You can define 
how deep the search is to be. You can filter out addresses such as those with 
webmaster or admin. You can use additional filters to have the software only include 
url's containing certain keywords. It can also eliminate  certain url's with specified 
keywords. This makes for some very tight targeting. The cost of Hurricane is $ 250  
but scroll down to see the package deal.

                       For a demo of Hurricane call toll free 800-942-7913
The demo will work showing you how fast and accurate the software is but you will 
not be able to save or use the addresses collected.


GEO SNAKE - This is a targeted list builder that could also be used to collect 
general addresses. You input a city and state and hit the start button, kick back and 
watch it collect. Quite fast. Easy to use. The cost of GEO SNAKE is $250.00

                       For A Demo of Geo Snake call toll free 800-942-7913

The demo will let you see how fast and easy it is to use but it will not save or let you 
use the addresses collected.
Note: Please read the help file in that it is a bit tricky inserting the name of a city in the 
program. First select a state and then go to options then search then add and then 
enter the name of the city or cities you want to search for email addresses in.


NEWS SLEUTH - This software extracts email addresses from newsgroup postings 
by keyword. It targets. Very fast and easy to use. This software has a number of 
useful options to help you get the exact results you want so reading the help file is
