Again, I ask: "Is that *REALLY* what you want?"  You want stupid 
congressmen and women to make new laws about spam???  Are you nuts?

*Really*, you want them sticking their small minds into the internet?

You and all your "organized ISP" brothers should just shut up and hit 
the delete keys, you bunch of fucktards.

Thanks.
