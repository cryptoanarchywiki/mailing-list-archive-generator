Depends on how the remailer is set up.

For example, I own the domain "geek.net".  If I set up a remailer and
messages resolve to "anonymous@geek.net", I suspect it will get through. 
I may need to also have an alias that /dev/nulls messages to
anonymous@geek.net, but that is still a legitimate mailing address. 

I think what they are trying to stop are spammers that have a return
address like "fakename@fakedomain.com" or "your@best.friend".  Those
wouldn't resolve and would just get shitcanned.

IMHO, there's nothing _toooo_ sinister here, yet.  But vigilance is
suggested.
