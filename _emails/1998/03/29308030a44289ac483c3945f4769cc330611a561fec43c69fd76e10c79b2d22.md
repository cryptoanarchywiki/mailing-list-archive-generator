I just want to say, with all the "nobody's" and "anon's" running around
attacking folk in private, I feel right at home (just like any other list on
the net, the "Know-nothings" are all over the  net).

And I'd like to apologize for my comments directed towards the list when I
first came, I was rather prejudice (against EVERY list) at the time, and my
compliments to the cypher's for your apparent open-mindedness.

It's cool to be here,

Stan,
Stan and the Sequencers
