THANKS FOR JOINING US, cypherpunks!

For full access to WBS using this handle you must validate your account.
To do so, please complete either of the following two options:

< Option #1 >  Reply to this email without altering the subject line.

This WILL NOT WORK if the subject line of your reply email is altered
in any way.  Some email serving software changes the subject line
automatically. If you are unsure whether yours does or does not,
follow the validation instructions in option #2.

< Option #2 > Go to the WBS Validation Page at
< http://wbs.net/validate.html > and enter
your account information exactly as shown below.

Handle:  cypherpunks
Password: cypherpunks
Validation #: 46910009

PASSWORDS ARE CASE SENSITIVE (e.g. if your password is "bob",
entering "BOB" in any password field on WBS will not work)

If you've decided you don't want this handle,
you can delete it by doing the following:

Go to the WBS Identity, User Editing at
< http://wbs.net/cgi-bin/user_edit.cgi >
Select "delete one of your handles" , then scroll down
and enter the handle and password exactly as shown below
and click "login".
Repeat on next page and click "delete".

Handle:  cypherpunks
Password:  cypherpunks

Thanks for being a part of the greatest community on earth!

By validating your account you acknowledge having read the WBS system
rules at < http://wbs.net/wbs/rules.html > and agree to abide by them.

If you do not believe you registered this handle on WBS, someone may
have accidentally entered your email address - or - someone may be
using your email address without your permission.

Registration to WBS is free and harmless and unless you follow the
directions above to validate the account, it will remain inactive and
unusable.  Why don't ya check us out?  < http://wbs.net >
