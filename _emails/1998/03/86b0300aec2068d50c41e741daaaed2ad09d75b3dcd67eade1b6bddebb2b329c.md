The lead attorney in Dan Bernstein's challenge to the US export
controls on cryptography is Cindy Cohn, a partner at McGlashan &
Sarrail of San Mateo, CA.  She will testify on the constitutionality
of export controls (and proposed domestic controls) on cryptography,
before the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the
Constitution, Federalism, and Property Rights.  The hearing will begin
at 10AM (Washington, DC time) on Tuesday, March 17.

The hearing will be cybercast in real-time, and will also be archived, at:

(Scroll down to the "Encryption hearing to be cybercast" link.)

Copies of Cindy's written testimony will be available on Tuesday from
the EFF Web site; see

	http://www.eff.org/pub/Privacy/ITAR_export/Bernstein_case/

I hope you can attend.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has not yet ruled on the
government's appeal in our case.  They hope to overturn our Federal
District Court case, in which all current export controls on
cryptographic source code were declared unconstitutional.  We expect a
ruling within the next several months.
