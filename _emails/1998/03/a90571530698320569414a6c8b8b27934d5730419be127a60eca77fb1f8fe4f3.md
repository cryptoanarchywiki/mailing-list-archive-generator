While I do not completely agree with the tone of the comments, nor do I
buy the specific numbers involved, I have found that the mouthing off
about the terror of Spam to take more bandwidth than the (EMail) spam
itself does.  I also fear legislative involvement much more than the
spam itself.

OTOH I dislike spam intensely and do reufse to buy from a spammer --
even when they occasionally have a toy I just might want under other
circumstances.

PHM
