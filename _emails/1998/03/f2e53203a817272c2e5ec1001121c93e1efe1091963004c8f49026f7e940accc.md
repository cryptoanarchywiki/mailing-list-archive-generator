Offhand, there are many ways to "pad out" ciphertext so as to make it more
compressible by standard compression algorithms.

-- duplicate every character several times, right after it first appears.
This clearly lets a compressor find "compression patterns." True, it looks
pretty obvious to a human eyeball, but it shows the theme.

-- insert sonnets from Shakespear. Same as above.

-- generally, lower the entropy by duplication, insertion, lengthening.

Not a "no amateurs allowed." Not at all. Just an obvious comment that one
cannot expect those of us who've been on the list for years to rewrite and
rewrite and rewrite the same essays. Search engines will turn up much
discussion. If newcomers are too lazy to read Schneier, to read the FAQs,
to read some of the many thousands of articles so conveniently accessible
with search engines, I have no sympathy for them.
