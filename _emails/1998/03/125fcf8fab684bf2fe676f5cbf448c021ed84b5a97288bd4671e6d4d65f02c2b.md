* Latest prices charged by parents to sell their kids (Covington,
La., January, $7,400; Orlando, Fla., January, $1,000); latest game
of automobile chicken that ended in a tie (Michigan Center, Mich.,
January, three hospitalized, one in critical condition); latest
attempted robbery in which the unarmed perp simulates a gun with
his thumb and forefinger but doesn't have his hand in his pocket at
the time (La Ronge, Saskatchewan, December, not surprisingly,
coming away with no money).
