I've heard it said 'Paranoia is reality on a finer scale.'

I believe it.

If you think that signing messages is paranoia, you may be right.. I,
for one, _am_ paranoid. I know the practical attacks that can be made,
and I've seen them work and, and demonstrated how easy they are.
Worse, I've experienced them. Maybe you haven't .. and thats good.
I hope your good luck continues.

But when you stick your neck out for something, you make enemies .. and I
have my fair share of mine.. and I suspect that many here have their too
(.. and when I think about it, they're prolly the same guys.. )

If I had it my way, I'd have all email sent to me encrypted. Next to
nothing, I'll take signed messages any day.

My keys can be had off of my home page (my rsa 2048 and dh 4096 can be
had off of my hard drive if I am online, else use the 1024 bit RSA key
stored on my provider). PGP encrypted mail more than welcome.
