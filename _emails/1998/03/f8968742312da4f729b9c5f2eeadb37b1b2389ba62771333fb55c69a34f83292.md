This guy is living his elitist life looking through rose colored glasses, with blinders on, in a vacuum, with his head buried in sand, with his neck snugly supported by his sphincter muscles.

"vision"?.... "sophisticated"?.... what is this?  If people disagree or are more cynical about what the government may or may not do concerning cryptography we are less sophisticated and/or lack vision?  What an idiot!!  Wake up and smell the bullshit you and others like you are shoveling.  McCain is a serious control freak (former AZ resident who has seen him in action) and will never, regardless of his vomitous, pendulous rhetoric, support a domestic "free encryption" standard without government controls, there will always be a catch.

The glass is not even half empty, it's shattered.
