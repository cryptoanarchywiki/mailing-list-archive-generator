Actually, I said what I meant to say.  If someone fakes it to the list,
then I'll see it now won't I, unless there is another attack or five
happening at the same time to prevent me from getting my mail from the
list, and from getting it anywhere else.

If I saw it then I would post a signed message informing everyone that I
*hadn't* posted it, and continue signing my mails until I felt it was safe
to do otherwise.

Don't feel you have to continue to illustrate your point though, even
though investigation of the headers shows that the message actually
originated from a mail server in canada.. I know you didn't do as much as
you could have to make the message appear authentic.

In any case, I don't see you signing your messages either.
