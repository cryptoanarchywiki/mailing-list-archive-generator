* In September, Mr. Anoki P. Sultan filed a lawsuit in Washington,
D.C., against Roman Catholic Archbishop James Hickey, claiming
that the Church was responsible for the devil's taking over his body
in 1983.  Sultan said that would account for his being out of work
so much, dropping out of college, seeking mental-health treatment,
smoking cigarettes, speaking in tongues, and engaging in
homosexual acts.  He sought either $100 million or an exorcism. 
(The lawsuit was dismissed.)
