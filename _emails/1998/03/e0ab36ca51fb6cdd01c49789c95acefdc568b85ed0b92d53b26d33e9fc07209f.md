So what do you need, E-mail, web space, shell?

We don't do shit until we get a subpoena, then those darned logs on the NT
server
well they just seemed to have corrupted themselves.

Course, this is NOT a invite to hack and fuck around with networks.  I'll
support objectionable content, not pricks.  No advocating violence against
people.

If any of you need accounts.  Drop a note.
