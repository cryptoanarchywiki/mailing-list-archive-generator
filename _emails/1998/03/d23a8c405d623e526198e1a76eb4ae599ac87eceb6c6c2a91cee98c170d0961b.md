 friend who lost his computer to a direct strike to the power lines and
 it took out the surge strip as well. At least in my case, it was not a
 direct strike into the power lines but what happened to my roommate made
 him get an UPS to at least have some protection next time. At least he
 will not have to possibly shell out another $1,500 for another computer. >>

I cannot argue against 'some is better than none' (or, if you're adding onto
your existing internal power supply, 'more is better than some').

BUT, of all things, when lightning strikes close to me, it takes out my modem,
nothing else. (and it's happened more than once (and they say it doesn't ever
strike in the same place twice!  ;-)  ))
