$.03 PHONE CALLS?
1+ dialing and 800 incoming
Hard To Believe...  But TRUE
With the amazing new Technology, 
you'll see calls on your phone 
bill for $.06, $.04......even $.03
Best of all, it doesn't matter 
what company you're now using.
You don't need to switch carriers!

Call anytime and leave your name,phone #
and a representative will call you back with 
information the phone company 
never wanted you to find out about.

Don't wait , call now! you'll love what we 
have to share with you on this exciting 
New Technology!
