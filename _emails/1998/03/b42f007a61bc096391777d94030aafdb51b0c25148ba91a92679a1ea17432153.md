MSDN Flash Tip
=================================================
Configuring the Call Stack Window
from Visual J++ Developer's Journal

During debugging, you can configure the Call Stack Window to display
only method parameters, parameter types, or both. Viewing only the
parameter types is particularly useful when your code contains a lot of
long method names.
