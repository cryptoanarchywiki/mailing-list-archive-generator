Don't that just suck... I was a bit pessimistic about finding
fucker.com, but lo and behold, there it was, www.fucker.com ...talk
about bullshit.  If they will register this, they should register
"pimpshit.com" too.  Talk about "selective memory loss"...sheesh.  I'm
heading to their site (internic) to bitch about their selective and
prejudicial policy "change"...
