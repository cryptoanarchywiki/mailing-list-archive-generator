Markoff in the NYT reports today on the release of a new 
Sendmail upgrade by author Eric Allman that will block 
spam by checking the legitimacy of the originating address 
before delivery.

The report claims that spam is up to 10% of e-mail worldwide,
And that Sendmail is used on 75% of the computers that route 
e-mail, all of which are being fitted with the new program.

What are the chances that this will affect remailers or other 
means of eternal anonymity?

Except Sualk, GL, UB and Nuh, all of whom we now know 
are Otot GinPu Tca as those crazy Syug Irtmid Irun.
