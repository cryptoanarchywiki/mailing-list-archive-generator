Excretion from Prologue 7/0 of Space Aliens Hide My Drugs:
  The only hope for Netizens to resist becoming Digital Sheeple behind 
the ElectroMagnetic Curtain which the forces of censorship/repression
are striving to put in place is for each member of the coming Army
of Dog to mark their meatspace and cyberspace territory and refuse
to go gently into the night when the Oppressor attempts to scare
them into submission with a mountain of laws and regulations which
promise unjust persecution for imaginary offenses.
  A Global InterNet Army of individuals committed to freedom must
strive to create a maximum entropy within which the chaos of semiotic
evolution can break the digital chains which the Statist Oppressors
are seeking to use to bind and repress access to information, global
communication, free speech/expression, and the evolution of the
Universal Life Energy, itself.
