The point I was thinking of was that such a timing would be when the country
as a whole was distracted with over-seas events. Since they were Aryan
Nation related, as I understand it, the goal was probably to further their
white supremacy agenda. An attack on some 'hood would cause a civil uproar
between blacks and whites that could have a impact of some importance. The
result of that could be quite pervasive.
