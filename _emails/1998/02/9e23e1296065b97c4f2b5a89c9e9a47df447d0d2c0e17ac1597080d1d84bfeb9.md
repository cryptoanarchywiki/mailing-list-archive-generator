True, but the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents aren't equivalent. In neither
case were the people involved committing aggregious crimes nor were they
expecting to be attacked by massed forces.

I suspect that implicit with the premeditated train robbery is the
expectation of pursuit.

During the American Civil War, Lincoln and his wife were having dinner with
several other government and military persons. During the dinner a
discussion arose about the best way to end the war. After much discussion
and depracation of the South Lincoln spoke. The gist of his rebuttal was
that the *best* way to win a war was to make the enemy your friend.
