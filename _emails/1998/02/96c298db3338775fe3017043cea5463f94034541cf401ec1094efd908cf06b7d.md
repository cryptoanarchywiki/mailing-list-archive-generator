That is my assumption, and being wrong would be a highly pleasant surprise.

If Moore's law plus algorithm improvements can give us a 2**150 increase
in processing power over the next 200 years, and I'm around to see it,
I'll be very surprised.  (Or I'll be posthumously surprised, if I'm 
not around.)  On the other hand, if that's true,
we'll be in something like the nanotech singularity, where
eavesdropping will make up for any remaining difficulty in key cracking,
as I'd also discussed.
				Thanks!
