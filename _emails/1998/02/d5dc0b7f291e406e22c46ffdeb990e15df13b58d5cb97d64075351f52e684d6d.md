Asside from this, when everyone finally figures out how to MIME encrypt
images, movies, sounds, etc. into their E-Mails, the net will become a
sespool of junk mail w/ 16-bit images that only really use 16 colors,
constantly flowng to and fro in a broth. Try to go to world-famous sites?
Ha! Spam is there, too.

The net can only handle so much, and spam by tradition isn't high on the
list.

When this happens, two problems arise:
 (1) people (not to forget Gov) will have a reason to break singing codes
 (2) confidence in the system will make signing fraud a very happy-day
       bussiness.

I would suggest, we all send a bit of spam out, 'accidentally' freeze the net
and show people what can happen. Asside from this personality change, little
can be done to keep people from sending spam (or, for that matter, pesonal
letters).
