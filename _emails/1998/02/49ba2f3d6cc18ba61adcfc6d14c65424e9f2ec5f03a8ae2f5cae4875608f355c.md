This in response to these comments in the SF Chron article, sent in a
sep. message:

>Wade Randlett, a Democratic Leadership Council activist who advises
>TechNet, said Feinstein's ``detractors are narrow- minded and hung up on
>her stance on encryption. If you look at any broad sweep, she is as big a
>champion for Silicon Valley as anyone in the U.S. Senate.''

Declan:

Below is the awaited article about Senator Feinstein and Internet
policy.

I also want to make sure that TechNet's position on the encryption
debate is clear.  While encryption regulations are not the only major
issue facing the industry, we recognize that they are extremely
important to many (including most of TechNet's members). 

While TechNet as an organization is not playing a role in the debate, we
believe the dialogue that we facilitate between tech CEOs and public
officials will help further all of our collective goals-including the
industry's domestic and export crypto goals.

Regarding Senator Feinstein, we hope that future meetings between her
and the industry are productive on encryption and other important
issues.

We do wholeheartedly appreciate the Senator's leadership with education
and securities litigation reform-TechNet's two policy goals.

Best,
Sean Garrett
