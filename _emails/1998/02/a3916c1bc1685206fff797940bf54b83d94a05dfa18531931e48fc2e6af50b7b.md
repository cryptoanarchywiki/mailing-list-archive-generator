It had nothing to do with the cypherpunks per se,
and the majority of the documentation was from Usenet.

Huh?

I'm just a pissed-off white guy.

And what makes you think Vulis will
not continue to post to the list?

You clearly HAVE NO IDEA WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

Comeback when you figure out the complexities of feedback.

Information Security has no idea why the list owner didn't succeed.

Detweiler my ass.

Buchannan can bite me, and Exon was an old fart who never used the
Internet, yet proposed CDA as the law of the land.

Louis Freeh has the morals of a styrofoam cup, and GAK will
happen over my dead body. You've obviously never read my CM.

PSINet terminated Vulis for stalking, which I
documented he did to a minimum of four people.

It took me three traffic analysis reports to convince them.

"Fire One" was a success.

   KRAP? key recovery and poopies?
