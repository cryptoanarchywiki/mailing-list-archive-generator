This is true, but you have to keep it in the right perspective. The
much more interesting question is a broader one: how widespread is GNU
copyrighted freeware?

One can configure a Sun workstation so that it looks, works and feels like
a Linux system, runs things like elm, fvwm2, vim, GNU utilities,
and so on.  I have seen a lot of such configurations, and in fact I do
use one like that myself.

How many millions more of these do exist?

[I think that Sun workstations in their default configurations suck big
time as far as user friendliness is concerned. They have the balls to
ship an OS where the Page Up key does not work with the default editor]
