Oh please.  You could always (for computers anyway) write your own drivers for
video cards and sound cards that not only display stuff, but also save it to
a hard drive as it's being recieved.  Whoop!

Exactly, it will probably require the average user to get involved in weird
type in the 5th word of the 6th paragraph on page 60 in volume 6 of your 
book and your ssn and your 3rd daughter's birth hour to display.  But once
displayed... it's yours.  Shit, things like Lotus ScreenCam can grab anything
displayed on screen.
