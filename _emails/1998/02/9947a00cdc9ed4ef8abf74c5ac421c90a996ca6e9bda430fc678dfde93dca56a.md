Immigration & Naturalization Department has been fingerprinting ppl for
years. Does anyone have any ideas what agencies that information is shared
with and what they need it for anyway?
And what's with that new thumbprint thing in banks? I haven't had occasion
to refuse it yet but I wonder if they'd open an account without it...
