Also Metronorth coming into Grand Central on 42nd st.., But:

Most subways are underground in Manhattan. A device that gives off enough
bang to be felt above ground has to be at least as big as a suitcase. How
likely is a suitcase unaccompanied by a human to go unnoticed on NYC
subway? Not very. Under a bus seat? A little less noticeable.

A smaller timed device would be limited to blowing up or gassing or
incinerating only whoever's on the subway - and the worthy victims
don't take the subway.

I think a parked car (or a car driven by a suicidal driver) is more
likely for delivering a suitcase or larger.

I object to any terrorist plans that don't include the complete
destruction of Columbia University and the City College too. :-)
