Yes, psyops (no ch) - the most venerable field of information warfare.

By the same reasoning, a bomb threat won't get a building evacuated if
the authorities can check whether the bomb is there...

A psychopath like Guy Polis could just call a TV station and claim that
he put some poison in the water supply which would take a few days to
test for.

NYC is one of the few major cities where the tap water is good enough to
drink and actually tastes good.

One could use brute force and just blow up enough redundant towers...
Or short them with a kite. :-)

NYC has pretty good public transporation... I don't think a terrorist can
do a lot by screwing up the traffic.

I recall that there was a bunch of bomb threates at Salomon Brothers last
year, right after Guy Polis was fired from his contractor job.  Do you
suppose the psychotic pedophile did it?
