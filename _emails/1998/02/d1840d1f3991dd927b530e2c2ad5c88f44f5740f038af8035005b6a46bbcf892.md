Manhattan would be easily blown, remotely. Place a time-charge
beneath a car at the head each principal subway line (which
commence in other boroughs), set to blow at the main stations.

For the West Side, supplement with a charge in the PATH train 
from Jersey.

For the East Side, supplement with another in the LI Railroad 
from the Island.

Forget anything above 86th Street, they'll applaud; like the
WVA and VA hillfolks will hooray the destruction of see-navel 
DC and its high-pitch babbling wonks.

As will anyone of any capital (or high-tech vale), globally, not 
drunk with power or mad to get it.

That's what horrifies the powerful about of terrorists: they're both
spitting images of their opponents. Both willing to kill indiscriminately 
for vainglory of blind faith and ambition. Both willing to betray
their kind for a step up.

Probably the stealth bombers will led by a highly trained ex-, 
or covert member, or Top Gun grad, of a duly authorized 
terrorist, wing, sub, cell set up to kill for a culture's honor and
commerce -- for blood-drenched national security. USG
and IraqG, any G, joined at birth, never separated, working
in concert.
