I have an idea for a model for deriving economic profits from 
writing free software.  It requires dcash (specifically,
some money that is cheaply and easily transferrable in small 
amounts).


People submit requests for changes to a "wishlist"/"bug report 
list".  Along with these requests they send dcash.  Various
mechanisms of market and/or trusted intermediary ensure that,
on the whole, the hackers who satisfy the most highly valued
wishes get the most money.  See 
 Grigg 1997
for one good idea of how such a market could operate.


We already have extensive networks of wishlists, bug tracking 
systems, and the rest of an integrated open, distributed 
software development system (e.g. Linux, Debian, many others).
Given the ability to pay (perhaps credit cards could be made to
work here?  Low cost credit card transactions?  Cybercash?),
we could start trying to add this kind of flow of cash to some
such systems.  Unfortunately, i fear that such attempts may
fail and disrupt currently working systems...

P.S.  Hi, y'all.  I've switched continents, contexts, CPUs,
sensitivities and perhaps more, but i'm fine.  Thanks for 
missing me.

p.p.s.  as per <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/slashdot.cgi?mode=article&artnum=685"> 
this slashdot.org article</a>, it is called "Open Software" 
from now on, not "Free Software".  Tell the kids.
