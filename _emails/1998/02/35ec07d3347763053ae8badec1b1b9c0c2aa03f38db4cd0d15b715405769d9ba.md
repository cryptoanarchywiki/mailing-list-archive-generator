Depends on where you shop.  I was recently at a store where my request
to pay with a credit card instead of cash elicited a look of disappointment
from the owner-operator.  Normally I'd have been happy to accomodate his
desire for cash, but when someone else is letting you charge it to their
credit card... well...

I think the real problem is dealing with big companies who want you name,
address, and phone number for their marketing dept.  Mom and pop shops
would much prefer to cut out the middleman.
