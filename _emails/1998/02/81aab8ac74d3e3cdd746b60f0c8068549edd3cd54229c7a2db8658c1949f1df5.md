Well, it's finally here.

Frankly, I'm a little disapointed with the presentation. It's based
around a program called Hyper Reader, from Intergaid. This seems a bit
out of date - the copyright runs from 1987-1994. While this may have
been driven by a desire to support Win 3.1 without extra software, an
HTML based approach would have been my preference.

I've encountered a few minor bugs in the few minutes I've played with
it; not all of the buttons work properly, and the color maps go to hell
when the program's window is not selected.

While the book data is stored in some proprietary format with an *.hw4
extension, chapters can be easily exported to flat text files. They
can also be exported in WP format, but diagrams don't seem to come
out (at least when I export them to MS Word) - figures seem to 
be scanned bitmaps from the books.

Here's the copyright data, which lists the books present:

For those wondering: Applied Cryptography includes the source code
appendix. I have not checked if it has the 5th printing corrections.
