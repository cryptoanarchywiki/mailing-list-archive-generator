Yes but who needs all this crap in e-mail?? E-Mail is a messaging protocol
not a protocol for large documents (HTML is not sutable for large
documents either but that is for another rant).

WARNING: This is the only time you will see me say somthing good about
MickySloth.

I must admit that atleast MS Outlook follows the RFC's and makes use of
multipart/alternative when sending out HTML formated messages so others
are not forced to use a webbrowser to read their mail (unlike Net$cape or
Eudora).

There is no place for HTML in e-mail plain and simple. I do not wan't to
have to load a huge bloated bugfilled webbrowser just to process my e-mail
messages.

Now this is really scary. You consider pushing weak 40bit S/MIME on the
internet users a GoodThing(TM)? I think you need to sit down and rethink
this one Bill.
