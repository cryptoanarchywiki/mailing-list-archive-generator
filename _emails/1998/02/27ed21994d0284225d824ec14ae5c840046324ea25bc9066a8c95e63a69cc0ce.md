SYMBOL TECHNOLOGIES AND 4MD CORPORATION:

Healthcare provider needs can finally be addressed electronically.  Symbol
Technologies and 4MD Corporation provide a complete point-of-care solution
for healthcare providers using a Winframe Server.  4MD Corporation has
developed a simple, yet powerful, browser-based, Clinical Decision Support
(CDS) application that runs on the Symbol wireless thin client over a
Citrix Winframe.  Healthcare providers can now pull up patient records,
review electronic medical records, lab reports, radiology reports and other
patient information as well as clinical guidelines all at a patient's
bedside, or in the exam room on a handheld, flatscreen, mobile thin client.

Symbol Technologies and 4MD Corporation solutions are designed for
high-performance data management, and for satisfying the unique demands of
healthcare applications where mobility, durability and ease of operations
are a must.

WINFRAME:

   Is the only software that allows you to access a single server with
   virtually any Windows application from across any type of network
   connection by any desktop without the software being installed on the
   desktop!
   Allows you to use existing hardware (old 386, 486 PC's) and still use
   advanced software applications, thus getting longer use out of the
   hardware and saving money.
   Gives IS departments more control and manageability over the network.
   Allows remote offices to access information easily from the main
   headquarters.
   Saves in maintenance costs.

WHY WINFRAME?

Today, more than ever, I/S professionals are pursuing cost-effective and
efficient solutions to enterprise-wide application deployment. Deploying
business-critical Windows-based application?s across the enterprise is a
monumental task for today?s I/S professionals. They?re faced with huge
obstacles including manageability requirements, multiple desktop computing
platforms, clogged networks on heavily trafficked LAN?s, inadequate
application performance for remote users, and poor security. And, if that?s
not enough, they?re expected to solve these problems faster, with fewer
people and a smaller budget!

RYNO:

RYNO is an award winning Bay Area VAR with top level expertise in both
networking and software development. We serve healthcare institutions from
building the network to developing the GroupWare applications that make a
network function efficiently as a whole.

RYNO?s mission is to provide our customers with increased profitability and
efficiency by providing superior technology solutions. RYNO in partnership
with Citrix Solutions is offering you a free seminar introducing WinFrame,
a new paradigm in information management systems!
