So were the 100,000 Iraqi military killed by Bush, and the 1,000,000
Iraqis of all ages killed by US sanctions.  So were the civilians
bulldozed into mass graves in Panama, so the country would look neat and
tidy for the arrival of the ReportWhores.

What the world needs now is not another mass killing of Iraqis by the
United States government.  What the world really needs now is a fifty
dollar weapon that sinks aircraft carriers.

Most of them would probably follow "legal orders" to fire upon American
civilians too.

The universe does not view the lives of Americans as more valuable than
the lives of people murdered by Americans.

You mean all those melted child car seats and scorched teddy bears on
George Bush's "Highway of Death" leading out of Kuwait? 

Unfortunately, for all the braying Americans do about freedom, Americans
can never be truly happy unless someone is telling them what to do, or
they are telling someone else what to do, or they are bombing someone for
not doing what they have told them to do. 

The only thing Americans understand is dead Americans.  The only thing. 

I've always believed that communications functions most effectively when
people are talked to in a language that they understand.
