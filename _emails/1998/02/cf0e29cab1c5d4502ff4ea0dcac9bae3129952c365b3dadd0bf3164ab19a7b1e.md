[BIG SNIP of story]

After reading all the stuff on MDT's, a got an idea.

How about a central monitoring web site (out of the US).  This system
would run a small server program that could accept input, via the net,
from MDT monitors around the country.  Each MDT monitor would collect
data and send it in once every 5 minutes.

A person could goto a web site and see what is going on around the
country.  Hmmm.  Watching the watchers??
