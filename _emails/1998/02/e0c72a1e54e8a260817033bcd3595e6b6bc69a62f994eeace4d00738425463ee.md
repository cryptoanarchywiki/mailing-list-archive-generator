GUY RESPONDS:

Dear Twinkie,

The problem is you no longer have all that good white creamy stuff.

It's solidified...you are literally hard-headed now.

You can't even...

: To homosexual anti-semites like Peter Vorobieff and Dan Koroleff,
: anyone smarter than them must be a "kike" - and this means 99.99%
: of the population.

You haven't had an original thought in a decade.

To get things CRANKing again, take a sledgehammer
and pound yourself in the head until it is a nice
soft consistency.

You'll feel much better.

YOU'RE WELCOME!
