Unfortunately, there's a conflict between real definitions of spam
(you knew it when you sent it, and the recipients knew it too)
and the real-world problems encountered with blocking/canceling spam,
which tends to result in either censorship or under-blocking.
Number of recipients _isn't_ the right criterion at all -
but it's objective enough to agree on, and usually makes a
clear enough boundary between most spammers and most non-spammers.
Rigidly defining numerical limits can also have serious problems,
because there are good messages that get excluded.

The more important number is the number of people deciding
which things are and are not spam - "More than 1" is best,
while "There can be only one" is censorship, either deliberate
or as a side-effect.
