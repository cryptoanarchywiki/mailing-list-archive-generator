Well before the Israel war of Independence no one was kicked off their
farmland. There was a native population of Jews that lived there and own
their own land. Those who migrated there durring the 1st half of the
century *bought* the land that they lived on and also actively created new
land that was fallow. Much of the current farmland in Israel was not
stolen from the Arabs but came from swamps that were drained and deserts
that were irrigated (much of Israel was either swamp or desert before the
Jewish Immigration started).

The plight of the plaistinians after 1945 is known as the "spoils of war"
and since the palestinians were the *aggressor* I have no simpathy for
them (ya pay your money ya take your chances).

<sigh> It is really no surprise that so few Americans have any
understanding of the History or Politics of the region.
