anybody have any ideas here?  this is a personal email forwarded to me
from a friend who *might* have cause to believe he is bugged.  this is
coming from a .au domain, btw.

thanx,

Yo tat,

I got pgp 5.0. which will not work with your version. Upgrade man :-)

Oh well I'll tell ya without pgp. It's not that much of a problem the
question I wanted to ask you (well I hope it's not).

Anyway, what I wanted to ask you is whether you might know why I'm getting
a very DISTINCTIVE beep when I connect with my modem to my ISP. The
beep(only once) comes just after the initial dialup and just before all the
noise you get before the connection. 

Sounds wierd and it only started 2 days ago. I never heard a connection
like this before and I'm wondering whether my phone line is being tapped. 

Any suggestions ??

XXXXX

P.S. Just in case my mail is being read by someone other than
Tattooman..here's to you (_|_)
