A few terabytes of storage isn't THAT expensive.
Let's see:
1,000,000,000,000 bytes
a CDROM holds about 640 MB, which means that 1563 CDs could hold it.
At CompUSA, that were recently selling recordable CD's for $10 for five,
but
with a mail-in $10 rebate which means you're only paying 32 cents for
postage
for 5 CD's. .32*1563=$500 or so.
Add in the cost of a few CD-R drives @ $300 each = $900 for recording.
Combined total=$1400
Within the reach of distributed.net, I would think.
