Someone, probably Jim Ray, has a nice phrase about
"Protecting the Fourth Amendment _is_ one of the legitimate needs
of law enforcement."  It's not an in-depth critique, but it's enough to
get a rant off to a good start, where you're on the moral high ground,
rather than the "Even the FBI's friends like Dorothy haven't found
a legitimate need for increasing wiretaps", which is a useful place
to go as long as you're already ahead.
				Thanks!
