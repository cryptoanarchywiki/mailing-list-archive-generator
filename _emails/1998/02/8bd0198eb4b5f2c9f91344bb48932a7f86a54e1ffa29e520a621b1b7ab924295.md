    well, I do, real well  --but you dont know rural Utahns.

    in reality, it's probably a tradeoff.  one of the reasons the
    Democrats use Utah as a dumping ground or national park is we dont
    give them any votes. you also need to remember that the first
    day of deer hunting season here is a holiday --and the number 
    of firearms/capita leads the nation --keep in mind how many kids
    us Mormons have --5 is considered a slacker....
