Fired programmer zaps old firm

NEWARK, N.J., Feb. 17 (UPI) _ A disgruntled computer programmer dismissed
from a defense contractor has been arraigned for
allegedly zapping his old firm's computer system in retaliation, causing
losses of $10 million. 

Timothy Lloyd of Wilmington, Del. worked as the computer network programmer
for Omega Engineering Corp., in Bridgeport, N.J. The
company, which has offices in Stamford, Conn., and elsewhere in the world,
produces high-tech measurement and control instruments
used by the U.S. Navy and NASA. 

Lloyd was fired from Omega on July 10, 1996, after working there for about
11 years. Twenty days after his dismissal he allegedly
activated a computer ``bomb'' that permanently deleted all of the company's
design and production programs, costing the company about
$10 million in sales and contracts. 

Philadelphia Secret Service head Danny Spriggs says the $10 million in
damages is believed to be one of the most expensive computer
sabotage cases they have ever investigated. 

Lloyd was also charged with stealing $50,000 in computer equipment from
Omega and taking it home. 

U.S. District Judge William Walls set bail at $25,000 and scheduled trial
for April 20. 

If convicted Lloyd faces up to five years for the sabotage count and up to
10 years for the theft count. He could also be ordered to pay
restitution and fines.
