>         GTE Data Services, Motorola Semiconductor, University Health
> System, and others are at the cusp of a trend toward leveraging the
> mainframe to back out of costly or unmanageable Unix and Windows NT
> client-server implementations. Brian Jeffery, an analyst with
> International Technology Group, an IT consulting firm in Los Altos,
> Calif., says about 70 sites worldwide are porting Unix or NT
> applications back to IBM OS/390-based mainframes. By fall, he
> estimates, as many as 300 sites will convert Oracle, SAP, and
> PeopleSoft projects to OS/390. "By 1998, there will be thousands of
> these accounts," predicts Jeffery.

>     "It's a brand new life for the mainframe," says Cal Braunstein, a
> consultant with Robert Frances Group, an IT market research firm in
> Westport, Conn. "It's far less expensive to tie Unix and client-server
> information into mainframes than it is to spread it out across much

>     University Health System, a 450-bed hospital in San Antonio, hopes
> to begin in August to move data-intensive applications, such as
> patient accounting and discharge, to the IBM Parallel Sysplex
> mainframe.  The project is expected to be completed by year's end. "We
> can't go in a direction of more and more resources for a nonending
> distributed environment," says Tim Geryk, director of technical
> services for University Health. "We need to turn it back the other way
> for a better scale of economy."
> 
>         Currently, University Health's enterprise has 2,500 desktops
> attached to LANs, 100 RS/6000 Unix servers, about 600 other Unix
> machines, 2,000 dumb terminals, an IBM ES/ 9000 bipolar mainframe, and
> an IBM 9672 CMOS mainframe. "It's time-intensive to keep so many
> workstations and servers up and running when so many different things
> can go wrong," says Geryk. "We can't put our hands around it anymore."

> across its enterprise. Bill Tudor, director of systems product
> management for mainframe maker Hitachi Data Systems in Santa Clara,
> Calif., says it's not uncommon to see multiple racks with 200 Unix
> servers in the data center. "It's just cheaper to run that same

> be centralized.

> Some intrepid IT users aren't just migrating some applications to
> mainframes. They're also consolidating client-server architectures
> onto big iron. One financial services company reportedly is
> consolidating as many as 600 Unix servers onto one mainframe, sources
> say.
> 
>         The hidden costs of Unix servers may be the final incentive to
> push many customers back to the mainframe. For example, CMOS
> mainframes may cost three times more than Unix servers, but management
> costs for distributed Unix servers are 20 times greater than those for

> one of five pilot sites for SAP's R/3 on the mainframe. Before taking
