But it is being rolled out all over, state-by-state, never a vote.

They don't have problems with illegal aliens in Georgia, USA.

A mercifully brief CM excerpt:
 
*   Dr. Linda Thompson:
*   YOUR STATE IS NEXT AND DON'T THINK OTHERWISE.  Sandia and other defense
*   contractors, without a war elsewhere, are OUT OF WORK, so they're
*   creating job security for themselves by helping fascists wage war in the
*   United States on us and our rights!!
*
*   Georgia, Texas and Oregon ALREADY require fingerprints for licenses.

It's like Wired magazine reported: the NSA is behind it all.

The DMV records are online 24 hours for FBI access.
