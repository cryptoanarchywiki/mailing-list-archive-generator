Except that one does not need government to form a limited liability entity.  It was never necessary.  These days in particular with secret voting protocols and anonymous communications, it would be trivial to have a limited liability entity whose owners had no personal liability for organizational debts because they are unknown and unknowable.  Yet they can control the entity without losing their anonymity.  This was always possible.  Now it is easy.

In French corporations were originally called (pardon my spelling) "socit anonime".

Certainly as a cypherpunk, you believe in anonymous organizations.

Certainly anarcho libertarians have always opposed government "incorporation" since they opposed government.

What about Trusts, Companies of Adventurers, lots of other things...

One can't impose responsibility on all.  Thus, I may be too poor to pay if you sue me.  So don't deal with me.  If you don't want to deal with an anonymous business entity, don't.
