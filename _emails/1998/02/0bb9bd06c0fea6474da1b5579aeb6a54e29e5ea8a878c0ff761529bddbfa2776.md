Pharmaceutical, Biotech, & Laboratories throughout the world 
use lyophilization (freeze-drying) equipment for preservation, 
concentration, and product development concepts.  Until now the
costs to employ this technology have been extremely high and 
operation has been complicated.

Ultra-Dry freeze-dryers are cost efficient, user friendly, 
portable and affordable.  These freeze-dryers are the answer to 
your needs from simple drying requirements to sterile product
development, packaging and validation.

If this information is applicable to another department in your 
organization please forward.
