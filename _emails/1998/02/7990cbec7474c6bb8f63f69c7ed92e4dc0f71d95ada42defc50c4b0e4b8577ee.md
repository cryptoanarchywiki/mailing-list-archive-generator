So do I, and I bet both our incomes combined doesn't add up to 15 minutes of
Bill G's and it won't. From a market perspective we're flies on the back of
great elephant. Please be so kind as to describe how and why this marketing
mechanism (copyleft) will succed? I've been using and supporting Linux since
1993 (SSZ is listed as a source site in the back of 'Running Linux' since 
day one) in this manner neither I or anyone else has gotten rich. Linus made
so much money off it that he went to work for a company in So. Cali. writing
fully commercial software...

It's copyrighted in the important sense in that it uses the copyright to
enforce its conditions. That is just as important as the marketing decisions
made by it.
