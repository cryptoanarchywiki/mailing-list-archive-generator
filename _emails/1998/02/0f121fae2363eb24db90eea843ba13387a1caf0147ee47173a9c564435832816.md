Much praise is due Markus and Ross for their astonishing
accomplishment in long-neglected Tempest research.

Their paper is surely causing sleeplessness in dens of
TEMPESTed security agencies accustomed to having
singular self-privacy and others-invasiveness via this 
technology. 

Microsoft is to be praised for funding the right thing for the 
wrong reasons, or perhaps Mr. Gates foresaw what the 
outcome would be and merely needs intel deniability,
nicely aided by Ross's zipperedness -- that, too, well done.

The Wash Post spin of the story is itself complicitous,
as was Mr. Baker's enticement. Thanks to both for aiding 
the incovert global revelation.
