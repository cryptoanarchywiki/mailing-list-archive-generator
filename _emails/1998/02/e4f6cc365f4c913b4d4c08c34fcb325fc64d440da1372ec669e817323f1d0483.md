I have no idea if my local 7/11 does this.  I don't even know
where my local 7/11 is.  I do however find it interesting that they're
implementing this policy when there are still legally-issued non-mag-stripe
driver's licenses in circulation... like mine, issued in 1980
(extended many times) and valid til the end of this year.

Never mind that the CDL isn't supposed to be a citizen's ID badge.

We're building Big Brother, one tiny step at a time.
I hear we're going to war against Oceania again next month.
