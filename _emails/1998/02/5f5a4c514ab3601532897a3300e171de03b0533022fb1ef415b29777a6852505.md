A guy, a pig, and a dog are the survivors of a terrible shipwreck, and
they find themselves stranded on a desert island.  After being there =
awhile,
they get into a ritual of going to the beach every evening to watch=20
the sun go down.  One particular evening the sky was red with 
beautiful=20
cirrus clouds, the breeze was warm  and gentle - a perfect night for =
romance! =20
Well, that pig started looking better and better and pretty soon the guy 
=

rolled toward thepig and put his arm around it.  The dog was not very=20
happy with this and growled fiercely at the guy, until he removed his =
arm=20
from the pig.  They continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but no more 
=

cuddling.  A few weeks passed by, and lo and behold, there was 
another=20
shipwreck.  The only survivor was a beautiful young woman.  She was in a 
=

pretty bad way when they rescued her and they slowly nursed her back 
to=20
good health.  When she was well enough they introduced her to their=20
evening beach ritual.
It was another beautiful evening, red sky, cirrus clouds, warm gentle
breeze, perfect for romance, the four of them lying there.  The guy
started getting 'those' ideas again, so he leaned over toward the 
girl=20
and said, "Um...would you mind taking the dog for a walk?"
