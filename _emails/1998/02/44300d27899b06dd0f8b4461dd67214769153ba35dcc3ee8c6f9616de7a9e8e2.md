    Tim May <tcmay@got.net> was purported to have 
    expostulated to perpetuate an opinion:

    The Gulf of Tonkin all over again. playing on the strings of
    perceived public patriotism

    Ruby Ridge, Waco, Oklahoma City...

    "jimbells"  -there but for the grace of God, go we...

    just like Waco underlined the need for more government suppression
    of whatever, or whomever, in the interest of public safety.

    and get something legislated which might be stricken by the 
    Supreme Court. if we're lucky.

           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    the desire to change leaders in the middle of a ScheiBsturm may
    be possible this time; Bush needed a nice little war, but as you
    point out, there was a specific issue: Kuwait. and George did not
    have the scandal, after scandal, ad nauseam...

    all it takes is a sufficient catalyst, an enabling act, to push 
    someone over the edge. who really needs nukes and their intendant 
    delivery problems.  our brave warriors claim Iraq does not have
    the means to deliver CBW --yeah, right.  it may be true they can
    not deliver it without suiciding the agents, but since when has
    the Arab world ever lacked for martyrs to execute a fatwah?

    bullies do not understand this; certainly not Saddam, and it
    is becoming obvious that Bubba is willing to do anything, 
    including selling our Americans to distract us from the almost 
    inevitable fact that his "need" for satisfaction warrants the lies
    and coverup.

>When Washington, the president not the pesthole, advised us to "avoid
>foreign wars," we should have heeded him. 
>
    we would be a lot better off if we had heeded not only the foreign
    wars admonition, but a great many more of Washington's farewell
    address. you never see it quoted en toto for the masses, never
    printed full page in the Times, never even taught in our schools
    --because it does not serve the interests of the ruling classes.

>America has become Amerika,
>Policeman to the World, ready to inject herself into foreign wars in
>Bosnia, Haiti, Ruwanda, Somalia, Viet Nam, Korea, El Salvador, Kuwait,
>and on and on.

    Pax Amerikana: may commerce prevail for Amerikan suits to
    rape, pillage, and burn uninhibited around the world. welcome
    to the interests of big money, central banks, and the NWO.

>"Pouring out the phials" may be rough justice for Amerika.

    you aren't downwind from Las Vegas and we were hit with 
    government experiments from the test range which not only
    dropped radioactive fallout, but anthrax.

    of course, it would not bother me if Washington, the pesthole,
    became a ghost town of rotting CongressCritters and bureaucrats.

    maybe Bubba should take this little walk around the memorials
    (unfortunately ignoring the last one which would displeased him, 
    but which would do us the most good):

        Clinton, distraught and contemplating his latest scandal 
        was walking through Washington looking for any kind of
        guidance. 

        He walks up to the Washington Monument, looks up and says,
        "George, you were always wise, what should I do?" 

        Low and behold, a voice comes down from above and says,
        "ABOLISH THE I.R.S. AND START OVER." Clinton, amazed that
        he is talking to the past President thinks he'll try it
        again. 

        He walks over to the Jefferson Memorial and utters the
        same request. "Thomas, you never had these kind of
        problems, what can I do to rally people behind me?" 

        Again a voice from above answers, "WELFARE, ITS NOT
        WORKING, ABOLISH IT, START OVER." 

        After hearing this Clinton is so excited he is planning to
        go to all the historic sites for guidance. Next he goes to
        the Lincoln Memorial.  "Abe, I need your help, people are
        losing confidence in me and they no longer trust me what
        should I do?"

        After a substantial pause Abe responds, "TAKE THE DAY OFF,
        GO TO THE THEATER."
