i would think that the big question here, legally, is whether or not you
would be ustilizing a US ISP and/or cellular provider to make the upload
of the crypto program to the foreign server via ftp.  as long as all the
packets stay outside of US borders, in other words, as long as you don't
use a US ISP and cellular provider, then i don't see how you would be
violating any laws in this case.
