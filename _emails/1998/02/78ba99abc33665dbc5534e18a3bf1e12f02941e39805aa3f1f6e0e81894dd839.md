You ever served in the military?  Unless you've been under fire, you should
shut the fuck up about shit you know nothing about nor could comprehend.

Listen up jerk, in case you didn't get any news during 1990, Iraq attacked
Kuwait, and murdered thousands of Kuwaitis.  "Don't start no shit and there
won't be no shit"... ever heard that, asshole?  America would have never
been involved if Iraq hadn't invaded Kuwait.  I was there, in a Bradley,
and we could have rolled all over Baghdad, especially after what the Iraqi
bastards did to the Kuwaitis, but it wasn't done. Unfortunately Saddam
Hussein stayed in power.  There will not be a shred of a chance for peace
in that region until he is DEAD.  I don't think air strikes are the answer
to this, and I think Clinton is a moron for his present policy, War is the
worst thing that man can do to other men, and there is no such thing as
"the good fight"... war is hell. Period.  Until you have been in a war, you
have no idea of what you are talking about.  But if you think that Iraq was
"more right" or better yet, "less wrong", you need a radical lobotomy, or
perhaps you've already had one.

Evidently, you again know nothing of what the Iraqis did to the Kuwaitis on
their way in to Kuwait.  Get educated, shithead.

You sound like nothing more than disillusioned, spoiled, pompous asshole
when you presume to know what Americans "understand".  Your anarchistic
ravings only mark you for the idiot you are.

To everyone else besides Cordian who reads this, my apologies, but for all
it's failings, I still have pride in America... ...not for all the foreign
policy bullshit or the way the government fucks us over, or starts wars, or
sticks their collective nose in other countries business...but for the fact
that as a whole people, Americans still keep trying, everyday, to be a
better people. I'm proud of that.
