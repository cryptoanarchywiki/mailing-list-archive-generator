And don't forget the "Department of Deadbeat Dads" thugs. As I recall
things, there was a bill passed in the California legislature to beef up
computerized tracking of driver-units so that deabeat-units can be
identified and marked for collection.

The invasions of privacy in the driver's license process is just
symptomatic of a larger problem:

* government claims that some activity is a "privilege, not a right," and
so claims that normal constitutional protections are irrelevant.

(One wonders if they believe the First Amendment doesn't apply, that Big
Brother may monitor what drivers are saying and deny licenses to political
troublemakers: "driving is a privilege, not a right.")

* government claims that the "regulation of commerce" language applies much
more broadly than the original interstate commerce and very general
rule-making language.

(One abuse of this was to say that if a student received federal loans, a
college could not practice certain of its normal practices...and the
college was forbidden from stopping the student from receiving these loans!
Catch-22. At this rate, churches will come under federal regulation because
they receive Postal Service deliveries. Or because government roads are
their only access.  And so on.)

Warrantless roadblocks are in place in my town, and, according to the local
newspaper, any driver who is seen turning around so as to avoid the
roadblock check will have his vehicle subject to detailed search.
