It provides descriptions of the RF weapons, their 
development, research and testing, global spread, and 
threat to the infrastructure and national security.

The Internet availability of Carlo Kopp's paper on the 
E-bomb and similar RFW information is cited as evidence 
of the spread of the threatening technology.

The hearing evolved from JEC hearing testimony in 
June 1997 which described the threat from RFW,
especially that developed by the Former Soviet Union:

  Magnetohydrodynamic Generator Frequency (MHDGF)
  Explosive Magnetic Generator of Frequency (EMGF)
  Implosive Magnetic Generator of Frequency (IMGF)
  Cylindrical Shock Wave Source (CSWS)
  Spherical Shock Wave Source (SSWS)
  Ferromagnetic Generator of Frequency (FMGF)
  Superconductive Former of Magnetic Field Shock Wave (SFMFSW)
  Piezoelectric Generator of Frequency (PEGF)
  Superconducting Ring Burst Generator (SCRBG)
