It was quite unnecessary: all a company has to do is require
all company business email contact go through the company's systems,
even if home.

Furthermore, brokers send email during the work day - like the
list of AXEs they have for that day - and send it in the morning.

Home email directly to clients is basically non-existent.

Stange, how monitoring home email to third parties would be illegal,
but Deutsche Bank showing up at a random time to demand (and watch)
you give a urine sample is completely legal.
