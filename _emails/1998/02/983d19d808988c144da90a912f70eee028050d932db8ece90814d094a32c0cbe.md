 Computer Information Systems. I should be graduating at the end of th
 Fall semester.

 PhD program.
 I would really appretiate your help in guiding me through this proces
 by giving me some advice on this, as to which schools offer a PhD in
 this field, the schools that you recommend, and how to go about this
 process.
