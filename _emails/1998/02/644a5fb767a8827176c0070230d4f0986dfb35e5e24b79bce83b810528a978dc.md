I received a response to the "Letter to Senator Feinstein" today. It reads
as follows:


February 3, 1998

Mr. Christopher Allen
President and CEO
Consensus Development Corporation
2930 Shattuck Avenue
Suite 206
Berkeley, California  94705

Dear Mr. Allen

	This is in response to a January 16th unsigned letter from a group
of high technology companies on encryption policy. 

	In this letter, you urge me to meet regularly with representatives
from the companies who sent the letter. I want to assure you that both I
and my staff do meet regularly with executives from California firms who
are concerned about all aspects of our government's laws and policies
regarding the high tech industry. Indeed, I cannot recall ever rejecting a
request for a meeting with a CEO on the issue of encryption or other
matters of great import. 

	Should you or any of your co-signers wish to meet with me, please
just call my or my scheduler, Trevor Daley at 202/224-9636. 

	With regards to my position on encryption, I have no one solution
that I favor, included mandated key recovery. However, I am concerned that
whatever solution is devised must provide solutions to the issues raised
by FBI Director Louis Freeh, which have been reinforced by classified
briefings and public hearings that I have attended. 

	Should you have any additional questions about my views on
encryption please review a Question & Answer interview I gave to the San
Jose Mercury News last September. My answers, though general in nature,
accurately set forth my thinking. However I recognize the complicated
nature of encryption and am eager to hear industry proposals. I look
forward to a continuing dialogue on this issue with you and your
colleagues. 

	With warmest personal regards.

	Sincerely yours,

	Dianne Feinstein
	United States Senator
