Has your technique been verified by any 3rd parties who are not affiliated
with you or your firm? Do you expect to do any public demonstrations of this
technology in the near future? Would it be possible to arrange for a
indipendant 3rd party to receive a test setup for evaluation?

That's good. The thought that given current technology a signal reception
van could pull one monitors display out of a building that could potentialy
have 1,000+ pc's (my last job had about 1500/floor and 3 floors) at a range
of say 200 ft. is truly incomprehensible. If it works that is a feat worth
many laurels.

You show up in my companies parking lot without my permission and start
snooping you'll be the one sitting in jail facing industrial espionage
charges. Any defence lawyer worth a damn would be able to blow this out of
the water, private citizens don't have the right to invade my privacy any
more than police without a warrant - and that take probable cause.

It's the monitors that need shielded, the computers already sit in a Faraday
cage. Simple copper screen glued to the inside of the monitor case with a
paper sheild and then grounded will resolve that problem. Be shure to put a
grounded screen on the front of the tube as well (similar to those radiation
shields that some companies make that don't work because they aren't
grounded).

A simple Gunn Diode oscillator driving a broad-band 100W rf amplifier will
swamp any signal you could hope to catch. Cost, about $250 ea. With the
new low-power transmitter rulings there wouldn't be much anyone could do
about it either.

Gee, and to think that when I've done this sort of stuff I only used a
Commodore 1702 composite monitor and some rf amplifiers and filters...
Duh, silly me. Any claim that it can *only* be done with lots of money is
almost always wrong.
