This has everything to do with Sadaam.  These individuals came to the
attention of the government a long time ago, have been under surveilance,
and their carefully timed arrest today, at the precise moment needed to
give the Sheeple an overdose of Biological Warfare sound bytes, is hardly
coincidental.

This is Bell Revisited, with the usual trotting out of someones personal
property accompanied by government editorializing.  "He had a map of New
York City!"  "You don't need nitric acid to kill aphids!" 

Oh right.  Big Woo.

Now all we need is some more propaganda on Russia's plans to sell Sadaam
that big vat, which "could be used" to produce biological weapons.
