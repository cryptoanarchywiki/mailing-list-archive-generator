Swiss Claim Israelis Were Spying

                     By IRENE HARNISCHBERG Associated Press Writer

                     BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Switzerland said today it
had caught Israel's spy agency in an attempt to bug
                     telephones on the outskirts of the Swiss capital. It
was the third highly publicized Mossad bungle to
                     embarrass the Israeli government in recent months, and
angered Swiss leaders.

                     ``The least Israel can do is apologize quickly,'' said
spokesman Franz Egle of the Swiss Foreign Ministry,
                     which formally protested the alleged bugging attempt
as a violation of national sovereignty.

                     Israel radio said the Israeli agents were trying to
eavesdrop on Iranian diplomats, but Swiss officials denied
                     the report, saying the targets were neither Iranian
nor diplomats.
