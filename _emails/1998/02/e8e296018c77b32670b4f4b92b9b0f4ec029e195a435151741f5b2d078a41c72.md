Your continued defamation is going to get you in a lot of trouble.

Cease it now, asshole.

Or you'll be the next Tawana Brawley defamation trial.

Besides the obvious, you've got _everything_ wrong.

   o I was not fired
   o I am not a psychopath
   o I did not download child porno
   o I am not AIDS-infected
   o I am not a faggot
   o I have been continuously employed since completing my Salomon contract
   o no one (name them) at Salomon or any other firm has stated otherwise.
   o I am not a pedophile

You'd better stop lying.

   Don't cross the line again.
