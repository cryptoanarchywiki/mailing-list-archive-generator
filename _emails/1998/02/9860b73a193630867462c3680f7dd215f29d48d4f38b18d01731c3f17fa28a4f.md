Well I just looked at my Tx. d.l. to make shure my memory was correct. At
least on Texas d.l's the *only* way to get to the mag stripe is to break the
clear plastic laminating cover. And I assure you that if that cover is
broken or tampered with the officer will become much more suspicous. It has
this nifty little seal embossed all over the laminating cover on both sides.
So going down to the local laminating shop won't work either.

Proceed at your own risk, it's your neck after all.
