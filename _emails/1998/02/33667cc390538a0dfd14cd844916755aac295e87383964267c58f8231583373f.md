    so where is the First Virtual Bank of Cyberspace? let's get crackin'

    basically, this says I can not write a check against an available
    balance that has not been overnight posted. when TTI (transaction
    technology), a CitiBank division in Santa Monica, started working on
    the ATM implementations in the mid-70, all the last, bad crop of hired
    guns were contracting --they were paying 50-80/hr _then_ for high
    end --we all took there money and speculated that eventually there
    a) would be no cash; and b) checks would be castrated --or, if you
    did not have plastic, you did not eat as big brother wanted to know
    what you had for dinner--  yup, sounds just like cybercredits --except
    for the audit trail fed directly to the IRS who precomputed your tax
    for you-- and took it out of your account with or without your     
    permission.

    well, how close are we getting to what those of us working on it in
    the mid-70s feared?
