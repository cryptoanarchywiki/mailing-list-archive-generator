The thrust of my arguments, in my several posts in this thread, has been
simply removing the laws which require True Names to be attached to
transactions, bank account, credit cards, etc.

No digital cash is needed.

The rest of Mr. Anonymous' argument is a straw man, based on the difficulty
of implementing digital cash.

When I say the real solution is easy, I mean it. Get rid of the laws
telling people how often and in what amounts they may take money out of
their bank account, get rid of laws telling banks they must narc out
customers who remove "too much" money, and get rid of any laws restricting
the use of names customers and their financial partners may use.

(BTW,  until these actions happen, no widespread use of digital cash is
likely to be accepted as legal. This has a lot to do, I think, with why
d.c. projects are moving so slowly.)
