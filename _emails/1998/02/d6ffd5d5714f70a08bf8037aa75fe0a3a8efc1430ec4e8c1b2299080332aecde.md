That's fine - people who take this approach may get less mail
from interesting people as well as getting less mail from spammers.
It's easy to find mail forwarding systems that don't cost much
and will filter out well-known spam, either for free or for a small fee.
Pobox.com offers this, and I think the iname.com systems do also;
I don't know about hotmail and other web-based mailreaders.

Most of us have flat-rate email, and the important cost is 
our attention span, not the transmission cost.  For other people,
that's not true, and sending them junk mail _is_ ripping them off
financially as well as ripping off their time and concentration.

As far as "how do you know something is bulk mail"?  The sender knows,
and the sender is the one being rude to thousands of receivers
if it is bulk mail.

This does not apply in countries that still have
Government-granted Monopoly Postal/Telephone/Telegraph companies.
It also doesn't apply in places where the Telephone Company
decides to charge for connect time by the minute rather than
flat rate - even if your internet provider is flat rate,
you may be paying 1-5 cents/minute - mildly annoying on a 
US salary, and much more so on a Polish salary.

And in a free market, you'd expect a mix of options,
since different people have different net connection needs,
financial constraints, and communications costs.
My main ISP offers an 800 number for about 10 cents/minute,
and I sometimes use it when I'm on the road at hotels with
stupider-than-usual telephone systems.

				Thanks!
