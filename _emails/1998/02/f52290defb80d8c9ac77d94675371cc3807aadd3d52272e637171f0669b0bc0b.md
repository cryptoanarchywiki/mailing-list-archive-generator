On 2/20/98 1:32 AM, Eric Cordian (emc@wire.insync.net)  passed this 
wisdom:

 Somewhere in there I also remember reading about the fact that Kuwait 
was slant drilling into a major Iraqi oil field and systematically 
pumping it for all it was worth. Not exactly kosher! Many greater 
conflicts have been begun for far more trivial transgressions.
