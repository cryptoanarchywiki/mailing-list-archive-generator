Hi, 

It's not a secret that the best way to attract traffic is through links from other sites. We currently have apx. 250 links from other sites TO US! This is nothing compared to Yahoo which has over 800,000 links from other sites. We are setting up a links page and offering a link to every domain or page that links to us. 

If interested visit our site at: http://www.mtcnet.com. If our site is ok link to us and send back your site address and category as IT WOULD FIT ON OUR LINK PAGE AT: http://www.mtcnet.com/links/ and we will link back to you. You should link to our main page: www.mtcnet.com and we will link to your main page.

Our site currently gets apx. 30,000+ views a month. 

Thanks,

Mark Cushman

P.S. We reserve the right as to which sites we will link back to, ie. no pornographic or related sites. If it's OK for my kids we will link back.
