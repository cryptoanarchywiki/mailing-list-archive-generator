May I suggest trying what we did here in Colorado.  Take a look at our
Taxpayers Bill of Rights.  No government in Colorado (state, county or
local) can raise taxes without putting the measure before the public
for a vote.  We have, for the time being, tied the hands of the
government.  They can't just spend money and expect to raise taxes to
cover the short fall.

It took 5 state wide elections to amend the constitution, but the
public finely wised up.  Each election, the State would promise to
change their spending habits.  They broke that promise every time,
once within days of the election.

We have also, on a few occasions, amended our state constitution to
force the government to fund specific items (Education for one) before
any other items may be funded.

If your North Carolina allows the public to patition to have a measure
put before the public in an election, try doing it.  It's not perfect,
but it might send a clear message to the government.

  Please forgive the grammar errors.  I suffer from using a Microsoft
spelling checker that likes to change the meaning of my words.
