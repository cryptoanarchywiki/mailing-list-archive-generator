wow!! well said.

a great book that nails this: "toxic sludge is good for you"
about the public relations industry and how it's playing the
tune while rome burns.

yes, and the cracks are starting to show-- how about that recent
rally in Ohio or whereever it was in which the audience refused
to stick to the "wag the dog" script? hee, hee. maybe there is
hope for us yet eh? one of the questions: "if other governments
of the middle east have weapons of mass destruction, why
are we singling out iraq?"

>America needs a low-level format.  Soon.

ouch!! that would hurt!!

another problem you don't mention is that the population has let
our own government run away. we send masses tax money but fail
to hold our own government responsible. "I am not responsible"
is the motto of immature children. we have an entire nation
of them, many on this list.
