Are you proposing that Cypherpunks are the Sheriff and his posse or the
outlaws?

>From the trainrobbers perspective this is certainly true. From the Sheriff's
perspective it shows the futility of his job if his goal is to stop all
crime.

Are the Cypherpunks here to rob trains or to keep trains from being robbed?
