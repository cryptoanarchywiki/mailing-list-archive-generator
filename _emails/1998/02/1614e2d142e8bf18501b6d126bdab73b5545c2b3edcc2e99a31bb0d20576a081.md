I can hardly believe that any of these schemes are undefeatable.

As soon as the CPU starts talking to a video and sound board, 
this whole thing becomes easily breakable. All one needs to do is
to capture the signals that go to these boards and re-record them.

Right?

Firms said to agree on digital anti-piracy system

LOS ANGELES, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Five giants of the computer and
electronics industries have agreed on technology designed to protect
Hollywood's most valuable products from being illegally copied, a
newspaper reported on Thursday.

The Los Angeles Times said Sony Corp (NYSE:SNE - news; 6758.T), Intel
Corp(INTC - news), Matsushita Electric Industrial Co (MSES.KL), Toshiba
Corp (6502.T) and Hitachi Ltd (NYSE:HIT - news; 6501.T) were expected
to announce later on Thursday a proposal to deploy encryption technology
that will prevent people from making illicit copies of copyright digital
content.

The deal could be a breakthrough for the entertainment industry, which
has been wary of the ease with which digitally distributed material can be
endlessly copied without any degradation in quality, the newspaper said.

``If somebody tries to violate a copyright, it won't work,'' the
newspaper quoted Mike Aymar, vice president of consumer products at Intel,
as saying.

``The goal is that you'll see products on the marketplace that support
this by the end of the year,'' Aymar said.

The proposed technology would have no effect on televisions, video
cassette recorders or computers already in use, the paper said.

It said the agreement was presented on Wednesday in Burbank, California,
to the Copy Protection Technical Working Group, a committee that is
led by major movie studios and includes representatives of the music,
computer, software and electronics industries.
