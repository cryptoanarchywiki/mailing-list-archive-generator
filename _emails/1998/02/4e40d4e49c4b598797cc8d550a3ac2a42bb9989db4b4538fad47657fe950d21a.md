The problem with this interpretation of the market is that AmigaWorld, Info,
Compute!, etc. didn't cover the hardware to that great a degree. What they
did do was discuss the programming and applications of those machines to
problem solving, education, programming, etc.

This point isn't the hardware and it isn't selling magazines on related os's
that can be applied to Linux because of its similarity. The issue *is*
increasing Linux' market share, magazines that discuss issue about AIX or
HP/UX that can be applied to Linux don't do that.
