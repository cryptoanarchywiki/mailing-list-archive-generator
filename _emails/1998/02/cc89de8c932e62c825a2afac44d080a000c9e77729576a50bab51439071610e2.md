I disagree, it would give you a gross baseline on the total emissions
between monitors and laptops. That field strenght measurement would at least
allow you to calculate radiuses of equal strength to calculate approximately
how far the emissions are from each class of device for equal probabilities
of detection. One of the specific goals is to measure how effective the
device is at effecting other co-located devices (such as seeing ghost images
on other monitors or causing static in paging equipment).

I suspect one could do it with a spectrum analyzer or a grid dip meter.

We're not trying to bring the individual vertical retraces out of the
chaff...we're trying to calculate the total comparitive emission strengths.
If that isn't high enough then trying to get individual componants of that
field will be useless.
