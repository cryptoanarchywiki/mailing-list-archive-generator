So? The land taken from a Palestinian farmer and given to a Polish Jew, for
example, remains his, morally. That a neighboring country has many persons
similar to him does not reduce his loss.

80% of Oregon is Aryan, just as I am. And yet if a bunch of Jews, for
example, kicked me off my land, land I had title to, and I fled to Oregon
to live in a tent, I'd still be fighting those who kicked me off my land.
Even if the Jewish Grand Foofah declared that God had "given" California to
the Jews 3000 years ago.

Oregon is under no obligation to absorb the Aryans kicked out of California
by the Jews. And the farm or land lost is still lost, regardless of any
"absorbtion." The canard about how Jordan is racially similar to the
Palestinians is neither here nor there...the Palestinian farmer who used to
grow oranges in Jaffa is hardly satisfied to learn that his land has been
stolen by a Polish Jew, but that neighboring Jordan has a lot of
Palestinians!

(BTW, I use the word Aryan in place of the word Caucasian, which is no
longer in scientific use, and was a dumb characterization of Aryans,
anyway. )

Who cares if their was a nation-state or not? Just give them back their
land. Period. Nation-states are a modern creation anyway.

I agree it's a mess. So why is the U.S. sending $5 billion a year extorted
from American slave-units to subsidize Israel's military and lifestyle, and
about as much to Egypt to subsidize whatever corruptions it favors?

I say pull out, stop the funding, and let American Jews send their money if
they want to. Let the Arabs and Jews fight it out. Just don't require me to
pay for it or to pay for soldiers to be sent to defend one side or the
other.

And use crypto and suchlike to destabilize the Zionist regime in various ways.

Whatever the history lesson, all I ask is that slave labor (taxes) not be
used over there, nor that cannon fodder be sent over there to die.
