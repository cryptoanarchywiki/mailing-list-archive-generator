Gives you a way of tracing the spammer and avoiding forged headers.

Hey, ISP's do suffer damage from spammers.   If they let too many spammers on,
they'll get black listed and none of their users will be able to send mail to
some sites that chose to drop all mail from spam supporting ISP's.  This way
it's an incentive for them to drop spammers.

There being a contract between the ISP and the throw away account requiring
the payment of damages caused, it would provide teeth to prevent spamming.  If
spamming occurs, the spammer gets to pay for their advertising.  Right now,
spamming is relatively free for the advertiser.

No, there is no need for a central server.  It's more than enough to require
the user to gen keys of a certain minimal length.  This takes CPU time to do
and enough so to prevent spamming.  If they use the same keys, the servers
will recognize and count the total, thus limiting them to a fixed number of
posts.
 
> Required identity repositories are a bad idea.

None are needed.  Just valid public keys linked to the IP of the incoming
messages.
i.e. a public key along with the ip the shit comes from signed with the private
key
is enough.  If the ip doesn't match the connection IP, the connection gets
dropped.
The fact that there's a public key means that the receiver server can track ip
to 
keys.  Maybe throwing a secured form of identd might help as well.

Erm, if you chose to, have fun doing it.  These are suggestions for a 
cryptographic solution as opposed to a congressional fuck you up the ass
and kill your rights solution.

Sounds good to me, except that it's a huge pain for the senders to send
any messaage to anyone.

As does my scheme.

Pushing crypto over legislation is worthwhile in any case, and pushes
towards anonymous reputation capital systems.

With a count of users.  If Dick Spammer is spamming someone he doesn't
much give a shit about 5 minute delays.  It only prevents massive massive
spams.  As long as the sysadmins don't notice you can send a fuckload of
mail even with 5min delays.

Yep.

Yep.

Erm, Think Different.  (I always did prefer Apple over IBM.)
