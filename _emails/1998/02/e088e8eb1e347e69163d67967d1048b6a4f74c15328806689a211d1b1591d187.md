on or about 980202:0940, in <6B5344C210C7D011835C0000F80127668B1610@exna01.securitydynamics.com>,

    pure bullshit. that would have been easily enough 
    remedied --get another contractor or invest $3K for top
    of the line equipment (<$1K if you dont mind fiddling)
    and do it yourself. 

    there may be a problem on their part to pay for the
    mastering and the first press run.  if that's the case,
    a few of us should try to acquire their publshing rights
    and get the job over with.

    1) the creditor lawyers?

    2) more likely the Feds under EAR since there is code
       on the disk and they know full well the mean time
       to export is <60 minutes.

    the first option is solvable as in the contractor 
    problems.  the second option, well...  you know the 
    drill.

    maybe Peter Junger would like to front this and add it 
    to his open ended actions with the Feds?

    whatever...  but let's DO something; anytime I can get
    reference material in a searchable, displayable format,
    I've already got my wallet open.
