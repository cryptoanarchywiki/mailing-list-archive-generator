Hello, Everyone!

FC98 is fast approaching, and the FC98 organizing team is thrashing
together a General Schedule for the combined FC98 events: The FC98
Conference, the FC98 Commercial Exhibition and Exhibition Program, and the
FC98 Workshop.

In addition to the ASCII version of the schedule in this message, Blanc
Weber, the FC98 Exhibition and Sponsorship Manager, has put a very nice
tabular version on the web for easy printing:
<http://www.cnw.com/~blancw/FC98Sched/FC98Schd.html>

Please send any corrections you might have to me offline.


Okay, here's the schedule's roadmap:

(CON) means conference activity, and an FC98 Conference Badge is required
for attendance.

(CE) means Commercial Exhibition activity, and is open to the public.

(ECC) means Ecliptical Curve Cruise; Conference badgeholders go free, but
badges are non-transferrable. Additional tickets for the Cruise are
available for sale to FC98-associated people (family, friends, etc.).

(IFCA) means the founding meeting of the International Financial
Cryptography Association, which all FC98 Conference badgeholders,
booth-holders and sponsors are now automatically members of. Only
Conference badgeholders can vote at the first General Meeting of the
Association, however.

We don't have anything about the Workshop on this message, but we will have
a schedule for it soon on the web page, for those of you who are interested
in sticking around another week for the world's only financial cryptography
bootcamp. :-).


Also, all FC98 badgeholders, friends, and family are invited to the
"Welcome to Anguilla" session on Monday to get some information and advice
on what to do during your stay on Anguilla.


Finally, like all schedules, this one is subject to change at a moment's
notice. ;-). We'll try to keep the website as up-to-date as possible,
because it's probably a good idea not to spam you nice folks will all the
updates as they happen. :-)

See you in Anguilla!

Cheers,
Robert Hettinga,
General Chairman,
The 1998 Financial Cryptography Conference, Exhibition and Workshop (FC98)
