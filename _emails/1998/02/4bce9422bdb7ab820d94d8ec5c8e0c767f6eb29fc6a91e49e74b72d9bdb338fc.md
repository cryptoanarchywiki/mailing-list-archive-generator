Sydney, Australia. (19 Oct, 1997).  Fortify for Netscape, version 1.2.1,
with support for strong S/MIME, has now been released.

Fortify for Netscape is a system that provides world-wide, unconditional,
full strength, 128-bit encryption to users of Netscape's Web browsers.
If you routinely use Netscape's export grade Web browsers (i.e. the ones
that are available on the net), then you need Fortify. 

This new version supports two significant improvements to the strong crypto
in the 4.x Netscape web browsers - namely long RSA keys (1024-bits) for key
generation, and strong S/MIME encryption for your e-mail messages.
These improvements are in addition to the 128-bit SSL services already
provided by Fortify.

Version 1.2.1 is available on Windows 95 and NT immediately.  The Unix versions
are being finalized, and these will be released over the coming few days.

Fortify costs nothing to download and use. Nil. Zippo. Zilch.  It currently
supports most, if not all, of the non-beta versions of Netscape Navigator
(3.0x) and Communicator (4.0x), that have been released on the following
platforms:-

	Alpha DEC-OSF
	Mips SGI-Irix 5.x and 6.x 
	Sparc Sun-Solaris 2.x 
	Sparc Sun-SunOS 4.1.3_U1 
	x86 BSD, FreeBSD and BSDI
	x86 Linux-Elf 
	x86 Microsoft Win95 and WinNT 

Full details about availability, copyright, download sites, latest news,
and an FAQ guide can all be found at the Fortify web site:-
