I don't like people who forge quotes from me in their netly news "exposes",
as Declan has done.

Center for Democracy in Technology doesn't like Declan either - they've even
complained to Declan's editors at Time Warner about his lies and fabrications.

What does it mean when the Vulis, CDT, and the FBI all agree?

P.S. Declan, are you an alcoholic?
