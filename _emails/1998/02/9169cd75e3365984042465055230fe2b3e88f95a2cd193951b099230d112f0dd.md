FYI, here is the welcome message from cypher-list watch.  If you are
interested, subscription details follow at the end of the message.



================================================================
                         The CYPHER-LIST WATCH
PLEASE retain this message for future reference. When you need to
unsubscribe, change your address for purposes of the list or reach
the list owner for an administrative request, you will find this
message valuable.
About the list:

The Cypher-list watch is a digest only list featuring information regarding
many aspects of privacy in the electronic age, such as encyption technology,
electronic privacy, anonymous remailers and related issues.  The posts from
the list may originate from other mailing lists to cover the broad topics
featured on the list.  All material forwarded is done so with prior consent
of the origining list owner. The list is suitable for many levels of user. 
Sometimes the topics will be *very* technical; others may just be *very* 
interesting! (Many will hopefully be both!)

-----------------------------------
CYPHER WATCH IS MODERATED!
In order to maintain a high level of quality, this is a moderated list. If
you have ever subscribed to a mariginally informative list, I am sure you
will appreciate the decision to present this material in this format. The
listowner spends innumerable hours every week culling through every post
from a pletorea of mailing lists to bring you the best of each. The concept
of the list could not be delivered in any other format. One way to think of
this as a Cypherpunk list without the noise!  If you want to stay informed
but you don't want to wade through 20 messages to read one useful post, this
list is for you.

Of course, moderating a list such as this involves a level of judgment, as
the Cypherlist Watch will not be a mere repetition of its origniating lists.
As such, some topics listmembers may think are important may not be covered
or may not be covered in the depth a member desires. List members should
feel free to bring such matters to the list owners attention, however, the
decision of the listowner redarding the topics to be feature is final.


------------------------------

Administrivia:

Submissions should be directed to the moderator at:

<cypherlist-watch@joshua.rivertown.net>

If a post is rejected I may or may not give a reason.  As long as
you use your common sense there should be no problems.  Attacks on
idividuals or companies are not permitted, so don't do it!  Continued
requests to post previously rejected material may also result in your
being unsubscribed from the list.


To contact the list owner in an emergency (Unsubscription requests
are *not* an emergency).
