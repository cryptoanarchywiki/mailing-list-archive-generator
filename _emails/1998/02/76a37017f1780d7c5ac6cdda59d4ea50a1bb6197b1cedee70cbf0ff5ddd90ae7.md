Not really; at its core, Chomsky's theory is a claim that every
human can learn any human language -- something that 2-year old
infants prove every day. I.e., nothing in language is specific
to any particular human social or racial group: the differences
are learned.  There is a fair body of research that indicates
that, after (roughly) puberty, humans do not learn foreign
languages in the same way that infants learn their first language;
but rather overlay the new language on top of their existing
language.

The code talkers used a variety of puns and allegorical metaphors
to hide the underlying meaning from someone who could translate
Navaho but lacked the overall shared culture of the Navaho sailors.
During the 1940's, only a handful of non-Navaho (generally linguists)
were fluent in the language (probably less than two dozen).

Incidently, in a recent episode of the South Bronx tv series, a crime
was solved because a black policeman was fluent in Japanese.
