 A very interesting RAND study, In Athena's Camp, was recently released. From the preface:

"New modes of war, terrorism, crime, and even radical activism-are
all these emerging from similar information-age dynamics? If so,
what is the best preparation for responding to such modes? When
the subject is warfare, for example, it is common wisdom that militaries
tend to prepare for the last war, and there is much historical
evidence to support this notion. Today, however, it is clear that defense
establishments around the world-and especially in the United
States-are thinking about how war will change, how the "revolution
in military affairs" (RMA) will unfold, and how the next war may well
be quite different from the last. Whether the focus is warfare, terrorism,
crime, or social conflict, we have striven to anticipate what the
spectrum of future wars and other types of conflicts will look like."
