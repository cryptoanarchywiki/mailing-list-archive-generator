#  Q: Who is Dimitri Vulis?
#
#  A: Dimitri is an XSoviet immigrant.
#
#  He harasses people all over the net with the most offensive sorts of messages,
#  and uses dirty tricks to retaliate to the people who do get offended. Among
#  his accomplished feats is a series of articles about cat-eating dogs posted to
#  rec.pets.cats (which caused a wave of complaints and made him lost his CUNY
#  account) ; a series of porno binaries with obscene comments about his
#  opponents posted to math-related newsgroups (he lost another academic account,
#  at fordham.edu, after this scandal);
#  [
#     8/3/97 http://corky.fordham.edu/fclc/faculty.html
#     Dimitri Vulis, Adjunct Instructor in Computer Science. BA, MA, CUNY
#     Dimitri: I haven't been teaching at Fordham for a few years.
#              It's too far and the pay's too low.
#  ]
#  ...and a series of racist articles denigrating all aspects of romanian life
#  and culture which used to haunt the romanian newsgroup for years.

It is a blatant obviousity.

Traffic analysis simply means convincing one or more people
that it's the same person...
