I've been saying that for a long time. I'm not 100% certain I wish to
eliminate entirely the corporation, but the idea of an 'artificial person'
as an entity to take the blame for crimes committed by real people is
highly dubious to me. If Monty Burns says, "Let's dump the toxic waste in
the school ground, who cares if some kids die!", then it should be he who
faces criminal charges -- not his corporation which gets fined.

A corporation, like any collective entity, is at best a convenience -- a
way to deal with large numbers of individuals by providing a central
identifying tag. This way, "Motorola Chips" can sell to "Apple Computer",
and the deal remains valid even if the chip-seller at Motorola and the
chip-buyer at Apple quit their jobs, because the contract was not between
those two individuals, but between the companies they represented. But just
as there is in truth no 'society', no 'race', no 'people', there is also,
in truth, no corporation -- it must all come down to individual acts and
individual responsibilities.

Not with the power of government behind them. That's like saying there's
nothing wrong with Joe's Deli asking Vinnie The Torch to pay a little
'visit' to Max's Deli across the street.

You eliminate/marginalize competition by convincing consumers to purchase
your products over theirs. Not by having the government regulate them out
of business. What you're looking at is corporate socialism -- the current
perversion of the 'free market' that America is living under.
