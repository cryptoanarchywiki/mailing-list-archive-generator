   "The network, dubbed Echelon, is described in a new study
    by the European Parliament titled

       'An Appraisal of Technologies of Political Control.'" 


It's high time Don Mclean (sic) or someone took the
extensive documentation collected in the Cryptography
Manifesto regarding this, which includes massive USA domestic
spying, and started writing news stories about it, and
get other news organizations interested in the questions
raised. Questions to be put to Senators.

Why?

Because it is ECHELON, not pedophiles, not drug dealers,
that is not only the hold-up for freely exportable
software, but also for why the FBI has openly moved
to regulate all domestic cryptography into oblivion.

The story of massive spying is one "the American people"
can understand. Cryptography is too distant.

Go for it, someone, please.
