>    [Technology] From the bragging-on-my-bro Dept
>    In what can only be described as a huge advance in quantum transitior
>    technolgy, The San Jose Mercury News is reporting that researchers at
>    Sandia National Laboratories have demonstrated a method of making
>    these devices stable enough for potential use in computing
>    applications.
>    
>    The Sandia quantum transistor is not the first to use a quantum
>    mechanical effect called ``tunneling'' to compute. Experimental
>    quantum tunneling devices were first made nearly a decade ago.
>    
>    But Sandia's is the first to be made using common manufacturing
>    techniques that would allow many of the devices to be strung together
>    to compute en masse, said physicist Jerry Simmons, leader of the
>    Sandia development team.
>    
>    And you know what the coolest part of this story is? Jerry Simmons is
>    my brother! Go man, go! I can only hope that he'll remember the little
>    people in his life when he sells this technology to chipmakers
>    world-wide! *wink*

>    Read about it here. Between Wine, Wabi, OS/2 and others emulating 95,
>    it's getting closer and closer to a point where you can try a new OS
>    without giving up your old software. This is important stuff people.
