Listened to an analyst on the radio expressing view that towards 2010
China will be leading world economic power.

Anyway interesting was that the analyst expressed that in her view
China was keen to avoid the mistakes of the socialist welfare state as
market liberalization and prosperity grew.  She considered the burden
of a welfare state to be a large burden which would mean that
China would outstrip growth in the west.

Also she stated that she thought democracy was in decline.  When
interviewed asked about human rights, she opined that these would
improve as the market became freer.  She stated that China hopes to
bypass democracy going straight to free market.

China may be interesting in a few more decades...
