	Oh it gets better than that!  I know of one person who got hit with
a specially formated porno-spam message.  When he opened it, the html message
did an autorestart on his browser and <you guessed it> there he was browsing
the porno site!  What a convenient feature!  Especially with you boss and
co-workers in the vicinity!

	Needless to say, that person has is now a rabid anti-html in E-Mail
fanatic!
