                           Call For Papers
                   New Security Paradigms Workshop '98
                      A workshop sponsored by ACM
                        22 - 25 September 1998
========================================================================

Paradigm shifts disrupt the status quo, destroy outdated ideas and 
open the way to new possibilities. This workshop explores deficiencies 
of current computer security paradigms and examines radical new models 
that address those deficiencies. Previous years' workshops have 
identified problematic aspects of traditional security paradigms and 
explored a variety of possible alternatives. Participants have discussed 
alternative models for access control, intrusion detection, new 
definitions of security, privacy and trust, biological and economic 
models of security and a wide variety of other topics. The 1998 workshop 
will strike a balance between building on the foundations laid in past 
years and exploring new directions.

To participate, please submit the following, preferably via e-mail, to 
both Program Chairs (Mary Ellen Zurko and Steven J. Greenwald) by
Friday, 3-April-1998.

1 - Your Paper

You should submit either a research paper, a 5 - 10 page position 
paper or a discussion topic proposal. Softcopy submissions should be 
in Postscript or ASCII format. Papers may besubmitted in hardcopy. 
To submit hardcopy, please mail five 
(5) copies to Program co-chair Steven Greenwald. Please allow adequate 
time for delivery. The hardcopy deadline is 27-March-1998.

Discussion topic proposals should include a description of the topic to 
be discussed, a pro and con position statement on the topic, 
identification of the parties who will uphold each position, any assurances 
that the participants agree to attend, and any other
information that the proposer thinks would support their proposal
(such as who will moderate). One potential topic for discussion is
"Is there a current security paradigm?".

2 - Justification
You should describe, in one page or less, why you think your paper is 
appropriate for the New Security Paradigms Workshop. A good 
justification will describe which aspects of the status-quo security paradignm 
your paper challenges or rejects and which new model or models
your paper proposes or extends.

3 - Attendance Statement
You should state how many authors wish to attend the workshop and should 
indicate whether at least one author will be able to attend for the 
entire duration of the workshop. The program committee will referee the 
papers and notify the authors of acceptance status by 12-June-1998. We 
expect to be able to offer a limited number of scholarships. More 
information will be provided on-line as it becomes available.

4 - The Workshop 
The workshop will offer a creative and constructive environment for 
approximately 25 participants. It will be held at the Boar's Head Inn in 
the vicinity of "historic" Charlottesville, Virginia.
