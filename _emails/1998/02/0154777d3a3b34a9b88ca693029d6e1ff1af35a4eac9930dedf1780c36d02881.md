Just fyi, I did look at the site and was astonished. Indeed anyone who uses
this Cyber Patrol is a fool.

Examples of HUNDREDS of blocked newsgroups:

rec.games.mecha Giant robot games. (Moderated) Quest/Illegal/Gamble Violence/Profanity Intol
news.groups             Discussions and lists of newsgroups. Intol
news.groups.questions   Where can I find talk about topic X? Intol
rec.guns Discussions about firearms. (Moderated) Militant/Extreme Violence/Profanity
