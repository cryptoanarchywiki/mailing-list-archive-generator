Wrong. I go in once a week and pull out money in a lump sum. I then budget
that money myself. The only thing they have is a sequence of deposits from
paychecks and withdrawals to cash.

I either take the fees in check and deposit them or else take 'in kind'
trade (eg I did a job if installing Win95 for a customer on some laptops
he'd bought via auction. There was a Tadpole 3XP Sparcbook on there. I took
it for my fee).
