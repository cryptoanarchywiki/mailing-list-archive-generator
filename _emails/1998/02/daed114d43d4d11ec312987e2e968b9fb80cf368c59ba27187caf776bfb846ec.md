The following is PGP's official response (from there web site) to the TIS
acquisition by NETA. What it infers is that while PGP for Personal use
won't (at least until NETA decides otherwise) incorporate TIS technology,
it leaves the door wide open for PGP for Business use....

Network Associates and Key Recovery

With the acquisition of Trusted Information Systems (TIS) by
Network Associates, NAI has added a new technology to its product
portfolio -- key recovery. This TIS-developed technology
addresses the market needs for encryption key recovery and
management. NAI will continue to provide this technology to the
market.

NAI's PGP product group already provides the capability for
corporations to recover information from PGP products deployed in
corporate environments. The requirement for this capability from
corporations has been evident and well-known for quite sometime. 

However, NAI does not believe there is a need for key recovery in
PGP products for the individual. NAI will develop and market
products that its customers need and want but will not include
any technology that is not required by its customers.
