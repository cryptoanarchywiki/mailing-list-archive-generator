Relax ... Tim is not condoning this guy's behavior.

The real issue is why NOW?  It's just a bit coincidental, don't you
think, that someone so blatantly advertises his intimate relationships
with biological weapons for years is just now suddenly being arrested?
In politics, timing is everything.

I am not the least bit sorry for this guy if he really possessed
anything, but I'm just a bit skeptical that this is just another routine
domestic terrorism arrest.

	Yet another wrong call by Tim "Chicken Little" May:

	>CNN is reporting a news flash, with few details, about two men
being
	>arrested in Las Vegas for making or possessing or planning to
make
	>anthrax. Details should be emerging, but I have a hunch it's a
witch
	>hunt, an invocation of the Four Horsement, to drum up support
for
	>Clinton's Dirty Little War.

	Nonsense.  This has nothing to do with Saddam.  These men are
from the
	Aryan Nation, a militia group (and one which Tim secretly
supports, being
	a strong believer in Aryan superiority).  No wonder he is upset,
when
	his favorite racists are shown to be just another bunch of
terrorists,
	willing to kill innocents to promote their hate-filled cause.

	>"Find us some jimbells we can show to the American public as
proof that
	>an undeclared, unsupported war with Iraq is justified."

	How incoherent can you get?  How on earth can terrorism by the
militias
	be related to the war in Iraq?  Jeez, what an idiot.

	>Wanna bet they also bring crypto in this media circus?

	This would be funny if it weren't so sad.  And you guys really
_respect_
	someone who would write this nonsense?

	It's a sad story when the one who is supposed to be the brains
of the
	group is this stupid.
