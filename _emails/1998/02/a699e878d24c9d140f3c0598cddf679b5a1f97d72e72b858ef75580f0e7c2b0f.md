Anyone interested in working on this for linux?  It should be fairly
trivial to modify the linux console drivers, disk driver, and possibly
keyboard driver to take these changes into account.  At the same time,
it might be nice to add the permanence counters for RAM and magnetic
media.

I'm a bit busy until at least after FC '98, or I'd do it myself.  One
of my goals is to keep my laptop as secure as possible, and that's
an application where TEMPEST shielding is rather prohibitive.
