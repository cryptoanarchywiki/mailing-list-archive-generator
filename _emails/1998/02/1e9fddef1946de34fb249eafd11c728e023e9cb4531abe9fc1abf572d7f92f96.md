A good friend of mine had the same idea in terms of Microsoft and Apple when
Bill gave Steve "Reality Distortion Field" Jobs lots of money.  His thought was
that Microsoft thought they bought Apple off.  What had really happend was that
OpenStep took over Apple (it did via Rhapsody) and that since (he believes)
that
it will be ported to NT and become part of NT later, it is really Jobs's way of 
taking over EvilSoft.

IMHO, I wouldn't mind if OpenStep penetrated NT.  It would certainly be an
upgrade
in my book. :)  Then again with the way EvilSoft worked in the past, it may
corrupt
both.

:)  We'll see I suppose.  But capitatism is indeed a good virus (one would
hope a strong enough one to topple the last of the big huge communist blocks.)
:)
