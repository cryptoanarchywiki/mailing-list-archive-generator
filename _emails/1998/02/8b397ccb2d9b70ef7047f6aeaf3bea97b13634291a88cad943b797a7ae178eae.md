Wow! I haven't seen this kind of reactionary temper-tantrum since the last
4th of July BBQ down at the VFW.

So how long were you in?? Usally this type of "God save the King"
mentality wears off after a boot has been in the field for a few months.
For the more febal minded it lasts longer but they usally never make it
above Cpl. or 1st Lt.
