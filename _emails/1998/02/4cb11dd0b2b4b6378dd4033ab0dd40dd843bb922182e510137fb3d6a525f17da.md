This is one of the things I love so about Texas and Texans.
Despite inexplicable rumors and propaganda about independence
and rugged frontier indivuality, Texans are as fucking
obedient to authority as the most lock-stepped fucking
Germans. The People's Republic of Texas is on the leading 
edge of Big Brother statism. Sales tax fully as high as
New York's, fingerprints at driver license renewal time,
roadblocks to fish for people who have been indulging in
adult beverages or who have outstanding warrants, and some
of the most dumb-fuck, clueless, fuckwit people behind
badges in the known universe. Texans will give anyone
their SS number at any time for any reason. Many print it
on their checks. Texas is without doubt the Rube State.
The only reason it isn't on the bleeding foreskin of
Big Brother technology is that there aren't enough clues
in the state to rub together to make a spark. When you
run into anyone halfway sharp or better in Texas, it's
a cinch they are a refugee from the unforgiving North.
