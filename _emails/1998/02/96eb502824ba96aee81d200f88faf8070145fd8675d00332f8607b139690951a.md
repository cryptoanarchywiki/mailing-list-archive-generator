No, its that the owner of a business doesn't lose his rights
by virtue of running a business.

No, the people running any size corp. have the same rights as
everyone else, to non-interference, etc.

Actually, libs have nothing for or against corps. ---only govt
interfering with them.

I'm not sure where you got your ideas about liberty, or
what anti-corporate libs you hang out with, but your
model of libertarianism is off.

If the natural (efficient) size of a company is big, so be it.
As long as you don't defraud or use force, you have the right
to grow unimpeded by govt to any size that the market selects.
No interference, no subsidies, same thing.
