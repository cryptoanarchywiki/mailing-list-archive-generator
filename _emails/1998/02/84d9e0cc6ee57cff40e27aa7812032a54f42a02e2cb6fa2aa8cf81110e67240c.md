Hi,

Another Linux market observation that would indicate that the total impact
of Linux is going to be less than what we as Linux supporters would want
is the literature that has arisen about Linux. In particular the count of
monthly magazines. Linux has a roughly 6M user market penetration yet there
is only a single Linux specific magazine available. In the comparative
markets of C64 and Amiga there were several (eg Amiga World, Info, Compute!)
magazines. Even today there are at least 3 Amiga magazines on the market yet
that machine hasn't been actively manufactured in over 2 years. Why is the
Linux magazine market limited to The Linux Journal? And what does that mean
for the long term strength of the market (and by extension the hurdles other
OS's would face in the future)?
