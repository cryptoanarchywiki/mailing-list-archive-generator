Nope, as a matter of fact the Administration was just arguing before the
SC that the murders in this case should not be held accountable.

One scapegoat and the organization goes on, business as usual. When I see
a 100,000 citizens storm the J.E.Hoover Building and drag that ratbastard
Freeh out by his heals then come back and tell us what a difference you
have made.

So what? IMHO he should have been fried. Hell I'll even pay for the plane
ticket for him to come down here and meet 'ol sparky. :)

What did it change? NOTHING

No not at all I just don't have any pie-in-the-sky daydreams that it will
mean squat! I have better things to do with my time than dealing with a
news media who's highest goal is to sell more tampons and toilet paper to
the sheeple.
