It's interesting that there has been much effort recently to return
property stolen in the '30s and '40s by Nazis and communists to the
descendents of the original owners.  For example a Romanian friend
recently got his family farm back.  And then there is the "Swiss/Nazi 
gold" thing.  But, so far, I haven't heard many calls for refunds and
property returns in the middle east.
