actually, you are right on target with your comments.  IMO, you didn't
miss anything.  i was simply referring to my dislike of random body cavity
searches and harassment by US Customs and customs officials in other
countries (i travel alot and have been subjected to alot of bullshit).  so
far, Japan was the worst of all the countries i have visited (18 at last
count in Europe and Asia alone).  they saw my waist-length hair, tattoos
and US passport....well, you can guess the rest.
