    dont need a flame retardent vest for my direction. I agree in theory
    that all it takes is a better product --unless the 800 lb gorilla
    steals it, borrows it, whatever and puts it out for free which they
    have been know to do on more than one occasion.

    and, the fact M$ has such enormous leverage in the market to command
    the pole position for any product they promote (even vapourware), is
    why society does have a responsibility to its members to level the
    playing field.  until the sheeple stop following the Judas to the
    Micro$lop slaughter house, the law must finally step in and break it
    up --or as Orrin Hatch said: "if M$ does monopolize the net, look for
    an "Federal Internet Commission" --using the law to surgically dismember
    M$ into logical divisions is one thing --living with another regulatory 
    commission is another, and certainly not very "tasty".
