 Chaos may hold key to encryption, researchers say

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The key to secret communications may lie in chaos,
researchers reported Thursday. 

 They said they managed to encrypt information by making use of a noisy and
chaotic optical circuit. 

 Gregory VanWiggeren and Rjarshi Roy of the Georgia Institute of Technology
in Atlanta said they were able to use the chaotic
 fluctuations in a light signal to hide information. Duplicating qualities
of the transmitter allowed them to decode the message. 

 The value of such tools is growing as electronic commerce becomes more
widespread and businesses try to encode their material
 for secure transactions and communications. 

 They did not suggest how their scientific experiment, which they reported
in the journal Science, might be given a practical
 application. 

 VanWiggeren and Roy said they used an erbium-doped fiber ring laser. 

 "These lasers are particularly well suited for communication purposes
purposes because their lasing wavelengths roughly
 correspond to the minimum-loss wavelength in optical fiber," they wrote. 

 "A small 10 megahertz message was embedded in the larger chaotic carrier
and transmitted to the receiver system," they added.
 "The receiver has the same non-linearities as the transmitter, allowing it
to unfold the message from the chaos." 

 Researchers have in the past been able to bury messages in a noisy
electronic circuit but the low bandwidths of the systems make
 them less practical for high-speed communications. Optical circuits have
higher bandwidths. 

 "These preliminary but intriguing results suggest that chaos-based
applications may be more than just a laboratory curiosity," D. J.
 Gauthier at Duke University wrote in a commentary on the findings.
