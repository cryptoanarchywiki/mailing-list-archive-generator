Or the version her innermost self expressed:

She's a buffoon who is probably the first one who'll be sent to the wall if
there's ever a Second American Revolution.

As for her concern about Social Security numbers being posted online, did
it ever occur to her and her ilk that perhaps the problem is the widespread
use of SS numbers by increasing numbers of government agencies, by
requirements that banks use them, by requirements that motor vehicle
departments use them, and so on?

"Duh."

The solution is not a new set of laws to felonize information like this,
but the elimination of the SS number as a universal identifier. Far too
late for that, of course, but Fineswine's laws won't help anybody. In fact,
law enforcement will continue its abuse of SS numbers, its role in
falsifying records and official documents, and so on.

Let's try to be sure DiFi is in D.C. when Abu Nidal makes his move.
