One would hope that this simply drives the market towords using
DSA/DH from toolkits like those available with support from Baltimore,
PGP, CryptoMathic, etc.  (I maintain a list of free and commercial
crypto libraries at www.homeport.org/~adam/crypto.  The list is
oriented at hackers and cypherpunks, and so gives far more  detail on
the free libraries.)

Theres no reason to be using BSAFE if it enforces Uncle Sam's
ludicrous political requirements.  Use a library from the free world.
Use algorithms that are not encumbered.  Theres no longer any reason
not to.
