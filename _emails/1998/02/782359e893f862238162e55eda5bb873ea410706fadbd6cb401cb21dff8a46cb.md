  1. Protect Concrete
 --------------------------------------
 
 When you consider all the elements and wear your concrete is exposed
 to:
 
 ALWAYS BEING RUN OVER
 STEPPED ON AND
 DUMPED ON 
 
 Water, harmful chemicals and abrasion all take their toll on your
 concrete. With all this abuse is it any wonder that concrete does not
 have the long life and good appearance it should have

 -------------------------------------------------------
  1a. THE CONCRETE CONDITIONER
 -------------------------------------------------------
 
*****NOW AVAILABLE TO THE HOMEOWNER*****
 
 Now you can do something to protect your concrete. The Concrete
 Conditioner has been available for commercial and industral use and is
 now available to the home owner.

 *****A Preventive Care Product*****
 
 The conditioner is a liquid treatment that seals your concrete from
 the inside out and makes it dense.  More importantly it transforms the
 surface from a soft limestone to a harder flint like surface.  After
 treatment your concrete is protected from water, salts, harmful
 chemicals and wear.
 
*****DO IT YOUR-SELF*****
 
 The conditioner is safe, easy to use and BEST of all it works.  We 
 have simple do-it-yourself directions.
 
 It's also affordable. It is possible to do your garage floor or drive
 way for less than $100.  When you consider the high cost of
 replacement---every home has $5,000 - $10,000. or more of concrete. 
 Conditioning your concrete is one of the best investments you can
 make. 
 
 >DON'T WAIT TILL YOU SEE WEAR, DAMAGE OR DETERIORATION.
 
 >MAKE PLANS TO TREAT YOUR NEW CONCRETE THE DAY IT IS POURED.  
 
 >CONCRETE OF ANY AGE WILL BENEFIT.
