If there were no copyright nobody would have any reason to market software
or much else for that matter. I would predict that much of the technology
and infrastructure we have now wouldn't exist. It would also stiffle
creativity and new methodologies because there would be no profit in it to
recoup development costs. Those who would survive in such a market would be
the 800-lb gorillas because only they would have the resources to squash the
smaller companies.

Free markets monopolize.
