Dear Sirs,
     
I have the pleasure to enclose herewith a copy of my C.V. introducing myself
to you as a person of very good experience in Freight Forwarding &
International Transportation and in the different commercial services
related thereto; and proposing myself for representing your company in Egypt
and the Middle East as its own local resident COMMERCIAL DELEGATE looking
after your interests and projects in this area.
As a matter of fact, among lots of investors, many international freight
forwarding & transportation companies have started their own presence in
Egypt seizing the opportunity of the economic reformation achieved in this
area; as now is the right time for business starting in Egypt.
Starting with Commercial Delegation I foresee our final target, in case my
proposal meets your interest, is to develop that delegation into the full
operating company's branch in Egypt. That is to be achieved gradually by
time, but as quickly as possible, through building a good account of clients
and by selecting and training an efficient professional work team.
In addition to my  qualifications shown in my enclosed C.V., I am actually a
USA resident as per the Green Card I have got for lawful admission for
permanent residence in America (Employment Authorized). Such advantage is
considered as a good asset for a person appointed by an American company to
represent it as its own Commercial Delegate in the area where he was grown
up. Speaking their own language and understanding their mentality and the
way they think, such delegate can move among the company's correspondents &
agents, its clients, the local official authorities, and any other concerned
parties to intervene, for his company's favor, to avoid any probable
problems and to enhance the company's achievements in this area.
For any further details and/or information, please feel free and do not
hesitate to contact me through any of the contact means listed among my
personal data in my C.V. attached hereto. You may also contact me, for the
time being and until Feb. 24th when I leave back to Egypt, through my
address in USA which is as follows:
915 Mount Olive Dr.  #3
Duarte,   CA 91010
Tel & Fax (626) 357 0243
E-mail: info@awbd.com
Looking forward to getting the honor of working with your esteemed company,
I wish you all the best and remain
faithfully yours.
