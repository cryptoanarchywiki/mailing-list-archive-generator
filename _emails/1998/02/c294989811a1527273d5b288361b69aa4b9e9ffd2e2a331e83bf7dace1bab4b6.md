 I prefer to view what Tim said in the context that "Amerika" the ugly
got its tail kicked in the broader sense. I don't believe that Tim took
any pleasure in seeing American soldiers getting killed.

  The fact remains that we, Amerika, did get our tail kicked in Somalia;
like Viet Nam it was little reflection on the troops but a reflection of
the of a command staff being run by Washington DC Apparatchiki all
suffering from cranio-rectal inversion. America deserves all the
ridicule that has been heaped upon it for those fiascos; only ... some
time, maybe we can but hope the we will finally learn at least one
lesson and get it right once before I go for the long sleep!
