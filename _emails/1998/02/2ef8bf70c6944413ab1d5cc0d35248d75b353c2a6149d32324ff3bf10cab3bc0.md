Seth Breidbart (Mr. BI>20 == SPAM) insists it is a valid style
of attribution to give it once at the top.

My question was obviously directed at "Anonymous".

So you don't get confused again, I'll keep repeating the attributions:

Talk about achieving nothing: what does server-to-server authentication
have to do with overcoming spam from throw-away accounts?

Hey, at least ISPs are making money from terminating accounts. ;-)

Jeez, take a breath between thoughts, will ya?

It is standard practice to trust only the last "Received" line.

What of it?

Again: what does server-to-server authentication have to do with
known unhelpful ISPs?

And how would throw-away accounts be affected by your proposed
massive change in SMTP protocol?

But these keys must be registered somewhere: whether it's at a centralized
site or distributed, *requiring* everyone to have a digital signature for
Internet access is twisting this elegant crypto-related technology: to
number each and every one of us, and is exactly what will make CDA legal,
because as soon as it's in place attributes such as "age" will be attached.

Required identity repositories are a bad idea.

What, you want _me_ to solve the UCE problem?

Okay.

I think if Brad (EFF Director) Templeton's whitelist system were
made available at the firewall/enterprise level, then widely
deployed, spam would be dead.

It's a handy little bot-reply mechanism that asks unknown authors
to verify they aren't sending UCE, else face a monetary penalty.

Replying correctly automatically causes the original email to go through.

Thus achieving the legal right to sue the spammer without
the legislation CAUCE is pushing.

The most important part of this design is that it requires
no control-freak changes to the Internet.

Don't suggest solutions that *require* digital signatures of everyone.

Sheesh.


This might work too:

Throttle email going through the ISP's mailserver.

Maybe 5/minute limit, flagging attempts to go faster to the admins.

As for direct PPP connectivity, upgrade router software to throttle.
(Port SMTP traffic)

Certain people, at the ISP's choice, would have a higher limit,
for mailing lists and such.
