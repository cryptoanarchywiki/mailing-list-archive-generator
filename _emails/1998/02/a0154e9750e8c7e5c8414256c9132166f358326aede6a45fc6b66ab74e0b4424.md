Here is something for us to check out. Was just emailed to me today.

I am curious how this person does it.

Dear Friends,

If someone named SandMan asks you to check out his page on the WEB

DO NOT!!!

It is at www.geocities.com/vienna/6318

This page hacks into your C:/ drive.  DO NOT GO THERE

 HE WILL REQUEST A CHAT WITH YOU....don't do it.

FORWARD THIS TO EVERYONE...
