For the last fourteen years, National Credit Systems, Inc. has been providing top flight debt collection services to over 9,000 businesses, institutions, and healthcare providers.

We charge only a low-flat fee (less than $20) per account, and all proceeds are forwarded to you directly -- not to your collections agency.

If you wish, we will report unpaid accounts to Experian (formerly TRW), TRANSUNION, and Equifax. There is no charge for this important service.

PLEASE LET US KNOW IF WE CAN BE OF SERVICE TO YOU.

Simply reply with the following instructions in the "Subject" field:

REMOVE  --  Please remove me from your mailing list.
EMAIL   --  Please email more information.
FAX     --  Please fax more information.
MAIL    --  Please snailmail more information.
CALL    --  Please have a representative call.

If you prefer you can always telephone us during normal business hours at (212) 213-3000 Ext 1467.

Thank you.
