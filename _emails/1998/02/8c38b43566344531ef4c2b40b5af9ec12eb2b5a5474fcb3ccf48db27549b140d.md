This is a function of the "Look Aside Buffer" and the actual operation is a
bit more complicated. The vmm must keep up with which processes have it
mapped, where in their indipendant memory maps it shows up at, what the
status is in each of those maps, whether it's sharable or not (though the
Linux vmm doesn't seem to do any write locking), and probably some functions
that I've missed.

There are two ways to do this in general...

Write-through: means the vmm goes ahead and not only updates the vmm copy
               but the copy on the drive. Note that this may or may not
               actualy update other copies if a process has one that isn't
               sharable (ie has its own private copy). This has a lot of
               over-head in that there is lots of i/o.

Write-back: means that the data in the individual pages doesn't get written
            to the drive until the page is either swapped out of active
            memory (and written to swap) or is closed. This is a form of
            'lazy propogation'. Again, this doesn't address how other
            processes may have their images effected.

One easy way, at least on a Unix machine, is to keep the system clock setting
when the page is created. Then close them in chronological sequence. This
obviously has it's problems. The first person to open isn't guaranteed to be
the first person done. Another method would be to select via a PRNG the
'first' process to update the page. Then each following would take their
turn according to the spin of the wheel. This leaves us with two options,
as each process closes it only writes the changes that it has made; which
could overwrite the previous user if they edited the same part of the file.
The alternative would be to force each user to create a different file with
some filename convention to differentiate them. Then leave it up to some
unknown method to arbitrate the file propogations at that point by some
'compare and share' method perhaps.

How do you know ahead of a read that a process is going to read that page?
Or are you saying that before another process can open a file we force the
first process to go ahead and write its changes? What happens once two or
more have the page mapped and begin editing? How do you propose to manage
the file closure writes that will occur?
