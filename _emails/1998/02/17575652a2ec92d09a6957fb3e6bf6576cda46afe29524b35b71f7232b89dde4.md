 While I feel that, considering its holier than thou attitude, the USG
is acting in a morally reprehensible fashion, these countries got what
they deserve; if they didn't have one of their own on hand, they should
have rented a crypto specialist from "Cypherpunks R Us" (TCM prop) to
check out the equipment/software. If the damned key was passed along
with the ciphertext it seems to me that it should have been easy enough
to tell by creating some known very short text messages ... are they
really that lazy/stupid/trusting?????
