NO, NO.  PGP licensing agreements are by the server, not by the client.  You
need 1 server in each local net, on an exported partition (drive).  Then the
users can run it from UNIX(NT).  You still have to combine the public keys 
onto a single keyring, but ...

BTW, arrange your contracts in two chuncks.  The small one has the high 
priced service agreement, and the large one has the licenses for the user
majority.
