I'll provide you a feed if you find that acceptable, unfortunately I am not
able to provide an account on SSZ to run it off of. My suspicion is that
you'll need a majordomo or similar remailer package (possibly with procmail
for duplicate filtering). I also strongly suggest you get your feed as a CDR
member and not a subscriber to a given list. That way if one node goes down
it won't leave you out in the cold (necessarily). You also probably don't
want to use a system that hosts a CDR node in case that site drops off the
net.

Good luck.
