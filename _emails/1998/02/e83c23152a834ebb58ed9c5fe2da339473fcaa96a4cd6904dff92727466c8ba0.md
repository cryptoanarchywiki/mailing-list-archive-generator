Well, my opinion is only one of many, but I just finished installing
PGP 5.5 and it allows both RSA keys (max of 2048) as
well as DS/DHH keys (max of 4096).  Most keys I'm seeing these days
are running at 2048, so 1024 could be considered as
"below average".  Just my $0.02
<<<<<


First, I do have a 2048 RSA key I generated with 2.6.3ix, but its in
hibernation and not on a key server, yet. (g)

Second, what is 5.5 compared to 5.0?  Let alone 5.5.3 as displayed in your
key block?  Third, I think its arrogant that PGP Inc. (and many many other
software companies) have left dos/win 3.x users behind.  The people, like
me, who still use DOS/Win 3.x obviously like it, not to mention people not
in the USA.

Then, because of the lack of conventional encryption, and other options not
in pgp 5.0 (I don't know about 5.5), and because its not freeware (freeware
doesn't fully support RSA), people on the Internet had reached the
concensus that they weren't going to stop using pgp 2.6.xxxx.  When I
complained about 5.0, one person asked me if my 2.6.3ix version had stopped
working.  Anyway, I think that PGP Inc. should release a version of PGP for
DOS that lets you generate longer keys, be it RSA or otherwise.

Finally, there are a lot of people in other countries (where PGP has spread
as widely as in the US, if not more so) who are not compatible with Win95
users using PGP 5.0 freeware.
