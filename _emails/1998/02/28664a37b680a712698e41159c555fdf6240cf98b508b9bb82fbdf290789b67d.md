The PLO ("Palestinian Authority") has banned pro-Iraqi demonstrations and
has seized the offices of newspapers and radio stations with an editorial
bent against the upcoming War with Saddam.

(Last time around, of course, the PLO supported Saddam.)

So much for any pretense of freedom of speech and the press.

(Not that I ever held the PLO, or the State of Israel, or Iraq for that
matter, as any kind of exemplars.)

Just something to remember when considering the implications of these
foreign wars.

No doubt Madelyn Albright, William Cohen, and Sandy Berger would love to
have had such press controls yesterday in Columbus, Ohio, when their
policies were booed and heckled, and when the questions asked were the
common sense questions many of us are asking.....

I chortled to see tapes of this event being replayed over and over again in
Baghdad.

But not in Israel. At least not in PLO-controlled areas, now that
Washington is their New Master.
