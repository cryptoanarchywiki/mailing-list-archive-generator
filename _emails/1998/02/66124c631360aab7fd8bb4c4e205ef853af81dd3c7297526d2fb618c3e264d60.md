I have raised concerns in the past over the rush to pass Digital Signature
Laws in various states. These laws have not been well though out nor did
they stand the rigors of peer-review of the crypto community before they
were passed into law. IIRC one of the states considered *encryption* alone
to be a *legal* signature!!!

I will not be using digital signatures for anything other than
authentication of messages. For legal documents I will stick to the old
fashion pen and paper with witnesses and a notary.

Just as a side note: Micro$loth is unfit to secure an outhouse let alone
somthing as important as network and data security (are these fools still
claiming C2 for NT?). I have never seen such overwhelming incompetence and
complete arrogance than what is centered in Redmond (IBM may be arrogant
but at least they are technically competent).
