Maybe illegal _now_, but Attila didn't say _when_. Further, even our former
prosecutor, Brian, told us that prosecutions are only made when some larger
crime is involved.

(For example, if I made two sub-$10K deposits or withdrawals, and then
later _admitted_ this was to bypass reporting requirements, *BUT* no real
criminal activity or tax evasion was involved, no prosecutor in the land
would bother with something so transparently trivial as this. Unless, of
course, they saw an opportunity to take a thought criminal off the streets.
Which is why I don't describe my financial transactions here.)
