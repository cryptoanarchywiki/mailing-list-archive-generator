Jefferson:

>and have great reason to be contented with it. Were I to undertake to answer
>the calumnies of the newspapers it would be more than my time and twenty
>aids could effect. For, while I should be answering one, twenty new ones

a friend of mine is studying Hamilton vs. Jefferson. it turns out
Hamilton loved newspapers and would write frequently under his own
name, or under a variety of pseudonyms. one biographer states he
assumed the personality of each as he wrote under them.  I think
Jefferson was at ill advantage in the face of Hamilton's tactics.

this is pretty hard to parse until one understands that an old 
form of the word "censor", as I understand it, meant "to criticize".
so "censor" as a noun and verb should be replaced with "critic" and
"criticize" for the modern translation.
