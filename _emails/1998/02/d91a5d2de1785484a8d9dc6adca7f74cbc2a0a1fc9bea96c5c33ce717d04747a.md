Apparently it hasn't, because I never got a copy of my own post back.

So, here it is again...

Leaving him with full access to a minimum of three other accounts.

   Don't cry for him, Ukrainia...

Hey, maybe _you_ would get a warm and fuzzy feeling when
Dimitry posts a death threat (including to this list) and
signs your name: not me.

Censor?

Yeah, and the "Freedom Fighters" who are against any spam cancellation
do so because they are fighting "censorship".

I don't think so.

No dirty tricks involved: I complained to PSINet using traffic analysis.

If he had simply called me a cocksucker, I would not have complained.

In addition to death threats, forging death threats: he tries to get
people fired from their jobs.

But Dimitry can't figure out where I work (MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA), reducing
him to saying I was fired from where I _used to_ work.

<snicker>

This stalking: attempting to deprive someone of their right to work.

Oh, great, an independently wealthy person is telling me it's not a problem
that a known stalker has posted angrily to this list asking if anyone knows
where I work.

Then please explain why you agree with Adam, since I decided to complain
to PSINet about Vulis stalking me and signing my name to death threats?

Ahhh, that's the wrong question. Look past your nose.

Calling me a pedophile is one part of Vulis' patented style of stalking
attacks. Add to that him saying I was fired from consulting work for
being a pedophile, asking if anyone knows where I now work, etc: stalking.

It wasn't merely him being insulting, but part of a larger
Simon-Barr-Sinister pattern of behavior.

Certain behavior is not permissible regardless of the venue.

Not a direct analogy, but: you would censor (CENSOR! CENSOR!) people
who work for you who wanted to speak "Ebonics" on the job.

Gosh, how dare you deprive them of their right to free speech!.

Exactly what I said: I submitted traffic analysis reports ("the big picture")
regarding Vulis' stalking activity via PSINet to their legal people.

I have previously posted to this list a dejanews URL for an early
traffic analysis report on him that I posted to Usenet.

It was like that, only more complete and specifically oriented towards
getting him spanked.

   >   Did it involve calls to law enforcement?

No.

He used an anonymous remailer for the death threat.

His personal stalking of me didn't get far before I blew him off PSINet.

I'm sure he's learned his lesson. ;-)

He's still here, but sulking silently. He's run out of dirty tricks.

   >   Is it likely that your claims would have been relayed by PSI to law
   >   enforcement?

Oh, I _wish_ I had that kind of influence.

Of course, in the Cryptography Manifesto polemic, I have said not-nice
things about law enforcement, as part of complaining about Key Recovery
and the general Orwellian state of affairs.

Guy's CM: Louis Freeh is a Scary Man with the morals of a styrofoam cup.

On the other hand, I do believe most FBI personnel are good people
who perform an invaluable service for all of us.

Guy's CM: This posting isn't about the many good FBI and other law enforcement people.

Gee, could I do a better job of offending both "sides"? ;-)


   >   If you have taken this far enough to get Dimitri into legal trouble,

Hell.

Freeze.

Over.

   >   What did you tell PSInet?

I documented his stalking behavior via PSINet, documented that he
had begun stalking me via PSINet, and stated that if they didn't
terminate him and he continued stalking me, I would sue them.

And that the traffic analysis report they were holding was
what a jury would use to decide PSINet was liable for their
continued (after _years_ of people's complaints) inaction.
---guy

    With Vulis, the best defense is a good offense.
