>      NEW YORK (Reuters) -- The computer security systems that control
>      access to 40 airports worldwide through electronic badges have a
>      design flaw that could make them vulnerable to terrorism, The New
>      York Times reported Sunday.
>      
>      A California computer security consulting firm, MSB Associates,
>      found the flaw in December in a routine audit of a large California
>      financial services software company, the identity of which was not
>      disclosed, according to the newspaper.
>      
>      Government buildings, including that of the CIA, and prisons and
>      industries with sensitive military, drug or financial information or
>      material also use the system and are also vulnerable to attack, the
>      Times report said.
