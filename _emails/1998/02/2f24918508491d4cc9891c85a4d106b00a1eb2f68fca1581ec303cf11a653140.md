Supposedly the UK is not going to prohibit cryptography, the
kindly and benevolent government is merely going to protect
us from irresponsible certificate authorities by licensing
the issue of certificates.

Thus in theory the ban should not affect Crypto Kong, which 
does not rely on certificates, does not attempt to address
the question of which Bob is the real Bob.

Instead it merely checks that the Bob who signed one letter 
is the same Bob as the Bob who signed the other letter.

(And you can make an encrypted reply to any signed document)

not from the arbitrary power of the state.
