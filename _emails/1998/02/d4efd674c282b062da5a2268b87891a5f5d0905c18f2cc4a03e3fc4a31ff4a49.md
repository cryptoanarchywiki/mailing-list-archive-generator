Btw, a report from the New Zealand Herald ( 1997-07-21 ) says that
New Zealand's secret facility of Waihopai ( believed to be part of Echelon ) was
being upgraded to be able
to monitor an increasing volume of telecommunications on the Pacific. Even more
interesting is that the NZ's Crimes Act was being modified to allow the interception
of
"private oral communications" ( phone calls ) of foreign states, organizations and
individuals.
