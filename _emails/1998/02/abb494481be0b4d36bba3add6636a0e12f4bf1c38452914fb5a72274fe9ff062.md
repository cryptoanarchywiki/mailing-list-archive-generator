All you'll get is resounding silence, especially since you're so clueless
as to get my name wrong: hint...not even 'guy' is correct.

What a loser!

You must love everyone seeing the old traffic analysis report on you:

    You'll have to go to URL 'www.dejanews.com/home_ps.shtml' to pick it up.
    Select "old database" and use this in their search box:
 
    ~g soc.culture.jewish & ~dc 1997/08/04 & ~s Brighton Beach

Perhaps it should be updated and delivered to everyone in your neighborhood
and the building you give classes in?

You're just a ButtHead who never grew up, still gets a kick
out of saying "cocksucker".

Your brother Michael had to do your math thesis for you!

   You couldn't even cut it in Manhatten.
