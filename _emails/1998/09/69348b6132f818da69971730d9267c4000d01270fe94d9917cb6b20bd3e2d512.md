  The point being that Single side band transceivers are covered by a VHF
license, and don't count as ham/amateur although the spectrum overlaps.
Morse and other archaic codes are not required. Connectivity to telephonic
land stations is available.
In the mid-80's I purchased a yacht and sailed out over the horizon.  In
the preparation stages for this I investigated the comms availability and
ran head on into the old boys/popular mechanics of the '50's crowd, that
insisted I endure their hazing ceremony and learn Morse.  Suspecting that
adding morse parsing to the deep structures of my brain would turn me into
a popular mechanic, I declined. Other alternatives existed -- one SW
solution was to type in ascii which was then translated into morse before
sending (and vice versa).  Seems several other would be Cap'n Blighs, had
the same problem.  Hence marine electronic stores started stocking SSB
transceivers, which I purchased in the form of a ham transceiver with
factory installed disabling for the US. I disabled that strap pronto, and
was able to enjoy both listening to the cruising ham tag hunters, and make
telephone calls from 5000 miles out in the Pacific (12,000 when calling
Bay of Islands net in New Zealand). I had no problem using it to discuss
work and to ship data.  Whether I was breaking the Federal Communist
Channels rules or not, I can't say.  Of course, not being a United
Socialists citizen makes this easier.  Where I come from you get the
license/call numbers when you purchase the equipment.

And while I've got your attention, on another thread entirely re:
renewable energy sources -- where I come from we use geothermal and
hydroelectric (think hoover dam), to power the country. A lot of
individuals who have steady flowing water with a good head, on their
properties, also power themselves this way.  We also use LPG and CNG to
power about 50% of our autos. I would expect that using all that
relatively cheap electricity to produce metal hydrides would make hydrogen
powered vehicles viable as well.

The Union of Socialist Americans tends to not have much in the way of
raging rivers, so there have been discussions about harnessing the moon's
energy by building tidal hydro generators.  Last I heard, the
environmentalists thought it might hurt the fishies (more than fishing for
agricultural fertilizer?), so nuclear it is.  I suspect there's more to it
than that, nuclear probably has more dick-stroking factor.
