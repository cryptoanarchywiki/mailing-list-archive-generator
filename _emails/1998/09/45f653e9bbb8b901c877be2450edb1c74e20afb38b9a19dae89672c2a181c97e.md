One of the things I like about the internet, especially email, is 
that my voice and the voices of others are leveled. My voice can 
reach a multitude of people at least intelligent enough to get on the 
internet.

But better than that is my ability to receive the other voices is 
enhanced much more. I can hear what a lot of people hear without 
their voices being filtered by the likes of Dan Rather, Tom Brokay 
and the rest of the Liberal broadcast media. It fact is is mostly 
just limited to what I choose to listen to.

I also get to talk back to people with whom I disagree. I listen to 
their responses and sometimes modify my thinking. I also get 
affirmation of what I do believe from people of a like mind.

Occasionally I am surprised to find others who are different but also 
intelligent and very persuasive in their convictions. I revel in this 
controversy and learn much from it. I confess that sometimes I troll 
for flames to get the dialog going. If you have something to say, say 
it! Even the words of the clueless are sometimes enlightening.

To all of you who are offended by what you read or have been attacked 
and shirk away I say, stick around, learn and grow. The words which 
come to you can not hurt you if you don't let them. If you are to 
timid to endure a few flames then woe be unto you if anyone comes at 
you with actual violence on his mind.
