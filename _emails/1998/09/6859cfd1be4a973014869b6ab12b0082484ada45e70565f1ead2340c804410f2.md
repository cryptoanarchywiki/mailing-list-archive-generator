Of course no mention is made here of the enhanced ability for goons to
steal your money.

It has been reported that these 'security threads' enable detection
equipment at airports to measure, or estimate, the amount of cash a person
is carrying. This further enables seizures which are now taking place in
the proximity of US borders, with the excuse that the carrier of the cash
could be 'intended' to cross a border, without filing a customs report.
Mere possesion of 'large' amounts of cash, in the proximity of a US border,
is coming to be considered 'prima facie' evidence of 'money-laundering'.

If I had been smart enough to see this coming when they came out with the
new security threads in $100 bills, I never would have traded the old ones
in.

Of course, carrying gold or silver will set off the metal detectors too.

I wonder if diamonds show up on the scanners?
