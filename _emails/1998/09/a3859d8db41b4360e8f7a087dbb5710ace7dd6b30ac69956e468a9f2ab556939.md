As a result of my trawl through my cypherpunks archive last week
looking for publically posted private keys by Toto et al, I grepped
out a selection of encrypted messages sent to the list.  I thought I'd
have a go at decrypting these with the selection of passphrases John
Young posted earlier today, in case any were encrypted with the
publically posted keys, or with a conventional encryption key.

I came across this post [1] posted in 5 Sep 97 which contains this
encrypted message, and "challenge" to decrypt it.

Now if you try to decrypt it, it says you need key 0xE6A9C799, the
public key for which is on the key servers.  However keyids are
actually stored as 64 bits, internally to PGP messages, but only the
least significant 32 bits are displayed by PGP normally.  I use
pgpacket to look at things and it gives you all 64 bits, the message
has keyid:

	0xAA33463CE6A9C799

however the key I got off the keyserver [2] has keyid:

	0xAA33063CE6A9C799

which differs by 0x400000000000 or one bit.  That would require
knowing how to create a 0xdeadbeef key or at least use software to do
this, if it is available.

Unless the bit flip is part of the "challenge".  Who knows.

Toto did allude to hacking skills, though largely claimed ignorance.
I wonder if this was feigned, or if there are other Totos who are
doing the key hacks etc.  eg this challenge out of bureau42.ml.org
remailer.

Toto is a one man computer crypto forensics persons full-employment
insurance! -- the amount of stuff posted to the list with various
passwords, keys, etc.  The IRS guys must be either hiring some one who
knows crypto, or are going to be seriously confused at this point.
Then there's the use of S-Tools, they must be going boggle eyed
guessing passphrases for S-Tools for all the images ever posted
anonymously, or pseudonymously to the list.  One wonders almost if
this was his aim.

Any hints Toto(s)?  Firstly I haven't got the private key(s) for
0xAA33[0|4]63CE6A9C799, and secondly, what's the deal with the bit
flips/0xdeadbeef attacks?

My september forward secret key is below [3].  It is authenticated by
my high security key, and 12 days time or so, the private key gets
wiped.

The EFF doesn't have a copy of the correct answer locked away in
a secret underground cave in Tibet, for verification, because
the above Forged Encryption message is just a bunch of crap we
typed in pretty much at random.

Does the government want to keep your private key in escrow? Give
them a copy of your EFF private key.
Hell, give them _two_ copies, in case one is corrupted.{;>) Smile
when you give them to the government agent. Ask him how his day
has been. Offer him some coffe, and ask about his family. Tell 
him you will send him a Christmas card with another copy of your
EFF private key, just in case the government misplaces the copies
you gave them.
Put your hand over your heart, salute the flag, and sing "God Bless
America" as the government agent leaves. Then fart.

Use the EFF Forged Encryption sofware regularly, to send messages
with Subject:'s like "The Plot Against the PREZ," "Confirmation of
the date of our armed assault," "The Nuke has arrived."
Keep a copy of your EFF Forged Encryption secret key in a directory
named "Off the Pigs." 
Most importantly, never reveal in your private email to others that
you are a deaf, dumb and blind quadraplegic who has been homebound
since birth. That way, the outrageous claims that government agents
make against you in their secret deposition for a warrant to kick
in your door and terrorize you will look all the more foolish during
your trial.

We at the Electronic Forgery Foundation realize that some of you wise
guys are thinking that, for $10 million, it is well worth your while
to write a program that will decipher the above message into something
meaningful. Well, knock yourself out, dudes, but if you think that
known forgers couldn't possibly be lying about the $10 million, then
go directly to http://www.clueserver/fucking_idiot, do not pass GO
and do not collect $200.
