I've noticed such discrepencies in the past as well. Unfortunately I have
been unable to figure out exactly why a particular remailer (I've seen every
one do this at one time or another) will drop the resend. I don't know
whether it's a time out in the various time-to-lives or what. I've noticed
that the various remailers will sometimes change message id's causing
multiple copies as well. I don't believe it's important since it doesn't
happen very often, as near as I can determine. As long as any archives
subscribe to all the lists and use some sort of duplicate filtering it
shouldn't be a real issue.

I do know that SSZ holds messages at least 4 days and my ISP holds them for
5 days so I don't think it's a connection problem resulting in dropped
traffic.
