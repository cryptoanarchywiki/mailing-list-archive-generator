Predictions: Crime and Criminal Justice in the 21st Century

1.      The United States will experience a significant economic 
recession/crisis very close to the turn of the Century.

2.      As the large pool of young people born in the early 1990s 
become teenagers and young adults, there will be a dramatic 
increase in violent crime around the year 2005-2010.

3.      America will experience sporadic civil disorders/riots in 
many of its urban areas during the next 10-15 years -- much of it 
related to racial/ethnic problems.

4.      Terrorist acts by "fringe"/special issue groups will 
increase at a significant rate -- becoming a major law enforcement 
and security problem.

5.      As faith in the criminal justice system declines, there 
will be a rise in vigilante-based incidents where citizens take 
the enforcement of crime problems into their own hands.

6.      Much of middle- and upper-class America will take a 
"retreatist" attitude and move into private high-security 
communities located in suburban or rural areas. Because of 
technological advances, many companies and corporations will also 
move out of the urban environments as well.

7.      Due to many of the predictions listed above, much of law 
enforcement and security in the 21st Century will become 
privatized and contractual. Traditional law enforcement agencies 
will primarily serve urban and rural communities.

8.      Law enforcement will evolve into two major and divergent 
roles: traditional law enforcement and a more specialized 
military tactical role to deal with the growing urban violance 
and terrorist incidents.

9.      Significant violence and unrest will plague our nation's 
prisons. Major prison riots will become a regular occurrence.

10.     With the decrease of the possibility of major global 
warfare, the United States military will take on an increased 
domestic "peace-keeping" role with America's law enforcement 
agencies.
