Forwarded:

Relatives report that Jeff Gordon busted CJ's teeth, which
is why CJ was picked up, not for his wasted carcass, but
for the the cutting edge incisors being hosted and packed 
around North America like suitcase nukes. The teeth 
allegedly hold the secrets of why everyone except the 
FBI wanted CJ.

Jeff sent them to a LANL for DNA mouthwash decrypt for
whatever CJ did to whoever to social engineer access to 
Motorola's algorithm's for transmitting DEFCON 1.

Which means us .mil Totos got to go to the backup plan 
for richocheting/encrypting/mixing signals to the sats. 
Anyone forget where it is, send me a msg with the PK

The word on the IC Net (see above URL) is that the teeth are 
rigged to resist for no more than twenty days under pressure 
of counterterrorism's bite. Then they bark Semtext: fucking
jerks, then go nuclear. Monday is a key tumbler click.

More, there's a forwarded report from the alleged CJ that he 
spit in the eye of the T-man, wrote "Helter Skelter" on the cell 
mirror with his blood, and then, slow chewing a turd, ostentatiously 
peeked up the lady magistrate's Victoria Secrets, for which 
she brazen-hussily ordered him to forthwith gaze up this: MO.
