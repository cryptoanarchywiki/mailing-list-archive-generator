I predict that naughty cypherpunks will use these passwords to repeatedly
add the following names to "Schlomo"'s list of contacts:

mark@sixdegrees.com
webmaster@sixdegrees.com
postmaster@sixdegrees.com
issues@sixdegrees.com

If that doesn't work, really naughty cypherpunks may also add the addresses
of prominent journalists.

Of course, those things would be WRONG.
