They're not looking to do tamperproof software.  Their business model can
be best described as: "better than passwords, cheaper than SecurID."

Here's the basic idea:  Strew a million passwords on your hard drive, and
make it impossible to verify which is the correct one offline.  So, someone
who steals the password file off the client cannot run a cracking tool
against the file.

It isn't bad.
