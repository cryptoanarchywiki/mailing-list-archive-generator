Because commercial satellite gear is almost always asembled from several
vendors to form a station, and because it can be assembled in many ways and
is invariably done so by professionals, there are no U.S. satellite
equipment regulations for such gear.

Surplus gear is pleantiful for those who know where to look. The hardest
part is building the SS mod/demod and that's pretty straight forward for
any competent RF engineer.

If low bandwidth links can suffice, the very large spread codes (such as
those used by GPS) can be used to place the covert channel well below the
noise floor.  GPS uses a whopping 63dB of code gain.  This in turn means a
small earth station with low power (cheap) transmitter can suffice.  I
would be surprised if you could use a backyard or even DirectTV antenna.
