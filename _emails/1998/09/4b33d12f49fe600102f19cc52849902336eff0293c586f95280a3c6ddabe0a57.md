     Woah....  I hate to interject noise, but I have to comment.  Maybe 
     Bruce's reply WAS a bit curt and not terribly helpful.  But it's 
     better to just let it drop, and not resort to criticizing typos.  I'm 
     a member of this list in the hopes that I'll learn something.  While 
     it's true that I didn't learn anything from Bruce's reply, I don't 
     think anyone gains anything from grammar/spelling corrections!

There's something wrong with you grammer.
