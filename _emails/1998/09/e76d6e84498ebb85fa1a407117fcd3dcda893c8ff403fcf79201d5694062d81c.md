Usually, it is done as follows:

1) Find a willing partner. If you're a Democrat, find a subordinate or an
intern.
2) Make sure your partner wears appropriate attire. If you're a Democrat,
a blue dress is appropriate.
3) Unzip your pants.
4) Tell your partner to "kiss it."
5) When you ejaculate, make sure your partner does something suitable with
the ejaculate. If you're a Democrat, ensure that she dribbles it over the
dress.
6) If you're a Democrat, ensure that she saves the dress, doesn't have it
cleaned, and then turns it over to the FBI for DNA testing.

For our AOL friend, the following has been converted into the Language of
the AOLholes:

i) find a wiling partner if your a democrat find a subordinate or a
intern...
2) make sure your partner wears right clothing if you're a democrat a blue
dress is right........
3... unzipp you pants
4) tell you partner to kiss it...
5-when u cum make sure your bitch does something with the jiz if your a
democrat make sure she drops it in the dress man...
6) If you'r a democrat make sure that she saves da dress...and doesn't
have it cleaned...and gives it to the FIB for RNA testing...
