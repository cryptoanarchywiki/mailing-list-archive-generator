Looks a whole lot more promising than the EUB (which turned
out to be a classic take the money and run operation)

The web site is not in the US, which shows that they are
serious.  Latvia is a pro capitalist, anti communist
government.  (I regard the US government as anti capitalist
and soft on communism),  The government sees itself as
presiding over an economy that is still basically socialist,
even though they have transformed far more rapidly and
radically than most of the former Soviet Union, in
particularly they have transformed far more radically than
Russia.

On the other hand, many of the facts that one would need to
know in order to know how safe your money is are simply not
made available.  In particular the web site does not mention
the banks name. 

Oh wow.  That does not inspire confidence.

They write:
       Q. What is the name of the Bank? 
       A. This is the typical question asked by "wannabes"
            and competitors.   Our firm does not disclose the
            name of the Bank until confirmation of the
            payment of our fees is received. The Bank only
            wants to deal with people interested in opening
            and operating such accounts. If the information
            provided by our firm does not satisfy you, then
            it definitely means that you are not interested
            in opening an offshore bank account. 

Well actually it means that any sane person would regret
handing over their money as soon as they discover the name of
the bank.

Some time ago a bank in Russia opened.  Its name was "Fuck
you" in Russian, spelt backwards.  The bank soon disappeared,
with the depositors money.

What is "fuck you" in Latvian?
