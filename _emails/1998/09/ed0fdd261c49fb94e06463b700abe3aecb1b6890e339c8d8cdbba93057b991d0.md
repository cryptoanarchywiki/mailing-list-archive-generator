To all: 
We don't care so much that WJC did it with Buddy,
or whatever, so much that he lied under oath.

It is only rarely we get the sons of bitches on
tape, and then you'll have to pardon us for 
exploiting it.

What the fuck, the TLAs leveraged their POTUS bugs for
years...

The only regret is that Frank Zappa was not alive
to put it all to music.
