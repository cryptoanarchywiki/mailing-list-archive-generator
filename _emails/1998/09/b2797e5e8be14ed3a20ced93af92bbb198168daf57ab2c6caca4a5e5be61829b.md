School bans `no rules' T-shirt

ASSOCIATED PRESS 

 WAUKESHA, WIS.

A fifth grader was ordered to turn his T-shirt inside-out because it
carried the message ``No Rules,'' which the principal said promoted
disruptive behavior.

But the youth's mother said Saratoga Elementary School principal Dale
Heinen overstepped his bounds and that there was no harm in wearing such
shirts, which depict cartoon characters and carry the slogan, ``Outta my
way. No Rules.''

Heinen made Cody Wilhelm wear the shirt inside-out so no one could read its
message.

``School guidelines talk about things that are disruptive and can lead to
disruption,'' Heinen said. ``If they are portraying that in what they wear
. . . we don't want kids reflecting that attitude or promoting that type of
attitude.''

Mary Wilhelm said her son's T-shirt was not disruptive and that parents
should have the right to dress their children with any clothes they want to
as long as they do not promote sex, drugs, alcohol, tobacco or illegal
activities. 

She said her son went to school last year wearing one of the ``No Rules''
T-shirts and also wore a T-shirt depicting ``Joe Camel,'' a cartoon
character formerly used to promote Camel cigarettes. School officials did
not object, she said.

``He should have never worn that Joe Camel shirt, I agree, but that dealt
with smoking,'' Wilhelm said.

``This is different. I don't want to have the principal tell me what I can
and can't do with my kid.''
