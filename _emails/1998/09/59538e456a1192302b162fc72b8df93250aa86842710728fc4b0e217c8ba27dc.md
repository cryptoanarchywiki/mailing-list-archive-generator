Ok, so I went and looked. That particular page covers ONLY Award and AMI
BIOS's. Every one of those *thousands* of machines have a BIOS which is
about 90% cherry and built from only a few dozen base builds.

It actualy supports my premise that despite the thousands of machines the
base BIOS images that drive them are really not that large.

And everyone one of them available publicly. You seriously think it's harder
to keep up with the number of BIOS'es out there than say tracking the
number of international phone calls in a year?

Not if it is only one or two, if it becomes a serious issue you bet they'll
do it in a heartbeat.

Your absolutely correct, they are paranoid.
