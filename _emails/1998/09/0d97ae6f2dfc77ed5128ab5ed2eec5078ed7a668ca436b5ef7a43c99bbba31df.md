Actualy no, Alex was showing some documents with government seals and such. I
haven't had a chance to contact him so far but intend to. The only way I
have of getting a hold of him is to call his talk show or his access tv
show. His next access show is tomorrow (Tue.) nite.

The gist was that some group within the US gov. did a test in some area of
San Fran. and several deaths occurred. It wasn't done with the knowledge or
permission of the Cali. or San Fran. officials as described by Alex to date.

As I find more info I'll pass it along.
