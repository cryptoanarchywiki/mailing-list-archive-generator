You'd need to use something like an eternity server or a data haven. These
allow one to obtain information from an unknown 3rd party based on a
distributed network of servers and search engines.

All transactions of e$ would need to go through an anonymous remailer of
some sort that interfaced to a suitable bank handlding EFT's via the
Internet.

The web surfing could be implimented via a CROWDS style mechanism.
