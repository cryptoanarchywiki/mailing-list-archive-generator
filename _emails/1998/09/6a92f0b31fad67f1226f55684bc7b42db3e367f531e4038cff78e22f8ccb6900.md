admittedly I'm not an expert on the subject,
but maybe the fan hands it back to mcguire for
authentication--for him to sign it, and return it to
the fan who then owns it. as far as collectors
items, a baseball can't be authenticated otherwise. 
I presume mcguire would have to write something
about "my 62nd home run ball"..

but your point is well taken. the IRS is getting
out of control. frankly I think they are like a huge
crowbar or vice that is slowly pressing down on the population.
all the loopholes are being removed from tax laws,
slowly, quietly. people who had no problem as independent
contractors (such as caddies) now get harassed by
the IRS. also, waiters & bartenders, who never made
much money, got a lot of flack over tips around the
late 80's.

eventually perhaps we'll have one world currency, and absolutely
no means of exchanging it other than through government
tracked mechanisms, all subject to taxes. 
that does seem to be the direction the world is heading.

I've written before on "alternative money systems". no
one here understood my points very well, but I still think
there is major potential for freedom through them. a sort
of 21st century tea party. there are some "barter cards"
that are taking off in various localities. these are
essentially tax-avoidance barter systems..  I hope they
catch on and force a showdown with politicians. eventually
the control freaks will be obvious and will not be
able to hide their tyranny. hopefully. the thing about
the american public though, is that sometimes they stay
asleep & give consent even when the tyrants emerge obvious.
