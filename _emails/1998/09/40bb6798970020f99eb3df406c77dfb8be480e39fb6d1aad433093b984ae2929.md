	       	  How to Misuse Good Cryptography
	       And Create Insecure Network Protocols

			  Radia Perlman
		  Boston Center for Networking
			SUN Microsystems



			     ABSTRACT


A common misconception is that security flaws involve abstruse
mathematical weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms. While it is
possible to have weak cryptographic algorithms, the world does not
need insecure cryptographic systems in order to design, build, and
deploy insecure network protocols.

This talk discusses example mistakes people have made when designing
or implementing network protocols. Examples include an e-mail standard
that allowed forging of signatures, a public key scheme less secure
than a secret key scheme, a system that thought encryption implied
integrity protection, and public key chain rules that are unworkable
in practice.
