"Among the elementary measures the American Soviet government
 will adopt to further the cultural revolution are...
 [a] National Department of Education...the studies will be
 revolutionized, being cleansed of religious, patriotic, and
 other features of the bourgeois ideology. The students will
 be taught the basis of Marxian dialectical materialism,
 internationalism and the general ethics of the
 new Socialist society."
     - William Z. Foster,
       Toward Soviet America, 1932

"...Stage III...would proceed to a point where no state would
have the military power to challenge the progressively 
strengthened U.N. peace force...
The manufacture of armaments would be prohibited...
All other armaments would be destroyed..." 
    -Department of State publication number 7277
