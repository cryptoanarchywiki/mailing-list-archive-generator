Whenever these people troll for flames here they get them one way or
another. Then it seems Merrill always tries to take the moral high ground 
and show us all his bleeding heart and tell us how we should embrace the 
AOL idiots and cherish them. The AOLers get triple effect that way. I don't 
think Merrill ever misses a chance to defend AOL and attack anybody who 
attacks them. About a week ago somebody posted a copy or parts of most AOL 
postings which were sent here in the last months. Merrill ignores the part 
about how the posts were classified and sends back some vague flame accusing 
the author of classing posts he disagreed with as "clueless" then he quotes 
the entire thing back to the list.

I don't know which is worse. At least the people flaming the AOL wimps are
funny.
