All Creatures Great and Small - that one... =)

I also read an Aasimov a while back in fifth grade - unfortunately, I can't
remember even the name... I need to pick some of his books up again... 
One book I can remember reading since 5th grade (and every summer thereafter)
is "IT" by Stephen King - one of his few really good books.  I have read it 8
times since.
I greatly recommend it =)
