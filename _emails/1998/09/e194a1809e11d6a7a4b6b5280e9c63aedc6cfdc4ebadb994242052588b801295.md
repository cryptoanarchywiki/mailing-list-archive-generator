I only sat on a university network at work.  (the admin machine was
mine.)  Alas I no longer work there.  Shoot, I no longer work in that
state.  But it took longer to plug my computer back togeteher in the
motel room here than it did to get on the air with AOL here.

Certainly.  I just hate to leave things uncommented when they talk about
me.  I have made that mistake in the past (ignoring what people say
about me) and have had cause to regret it.
