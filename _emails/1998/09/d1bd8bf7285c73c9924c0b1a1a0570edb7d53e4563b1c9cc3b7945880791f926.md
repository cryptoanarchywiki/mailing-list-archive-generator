Hi,

There seems to be a problem posting anonymous messages to cypherpunks@ssz.com. I have posted several messages over the past week and *none* of them have showed up.

I am posting this as a test message. I am sending it to the following addresses:

cypherpunks@toad.com
cypherpunks@ssz.com
cypherpunks@algebra.com
cypherpunks@cyberpass.net

I will add the server name to the subject line for each post to test which messages are being delivered and which are not.

I AM TOTOCUS!!




{% endraw %}
