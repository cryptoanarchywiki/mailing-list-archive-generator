You would seem to defend the First Adulterer/Purjurer, you question why I
call him this, but you don't want your employer to know that you support
the existing regime?

Yours is a curious blend of half-truths and inane justifications, with a
little in-your-face spitefulness.

As someone else pointed out, even this thread is a secondary issue.
I'm recycling the electrons you sent to me.
