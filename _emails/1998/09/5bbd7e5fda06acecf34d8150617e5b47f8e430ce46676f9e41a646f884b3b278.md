It should work, though I don't believe it's ever been tested in court. I've
been looking at the court forcing one to take immunity and can't find
anything that would support such actions. So if you haven't told the court
you will cooperate *and* you say nothing more than that you're taking the
5th there shouldn't be much they can do except charge you as an accomplice
and hope for a conviction on other material.
