I called and requested they take all ssz.com addresses from all their lists.
I also passed the number along to quite a few anti-spammers. You really

As to having auto-mated removal, I didn't ask to be added so somebody want
to explain to me why I should do anything to stop receiving this traffic?
Seems to me the only ethical mechanism it auto-remove on first transmission
without a subscription request.

Computers are *supposed* to make our lives *easier*. Some folks seem to have
forgotten this.
