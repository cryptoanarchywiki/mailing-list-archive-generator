 The FCC prohibits the use of transmissions encoded specifically to 
obscure the content of the traffic (which is exactly what our reason for 
using encryption would be), in essence they prohibit using encrypted 
transmisions. However, by wording the ruling that way they leave the door 
open for things like the ham radio satellite command channel uplinks 
being encrypted for security reasons ... but to do so they must, upon 
request, be able to provide the Friendly Chocolate Company with their 
keys.
