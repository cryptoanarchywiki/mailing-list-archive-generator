It does not prevent GPL'ed code from using proprietary licenses, it only
prevents companies from using GPL'ed code without first obtaining a non-GPL
licence from the original author of the code (who should deservedly get a
cut of the cash).

Re-use *without* prior permission of the author and copyright holder,
be accurate.
