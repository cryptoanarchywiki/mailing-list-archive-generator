About a week ago I sent a message the list regarding Toto and how I 
found it hard to believe he was a country & western artist.  I 
mentioned a tribute to Toto and an URL pointing to a web page on a 
data security product at a web site which is total spoof.

The URL lead to a page touting a data security product called PUP, 
Pretty Useless Privacy.  I shamelessly plagiarized Toto's concept, 
and even some of sentences, from a post on Pretty Lousy Privacy.  
I even managed to get most of the characteristics of Snake Oil in 
one sentence.  The graphics on the page is a Snake Charmer.

Now you figure the Feds will visit for sure, just try and spot them.  
Resolve the IP addresses to a domain name might work but if they 
had a clue they would use dummy domains.

I would like to nominate the folks at IP address 204.249.179.54, or 
better yet the whole Class C as possible Feds.  The IP address does 
not resolve to a domain name, actually all the IP address in the 
Class C plus the 204.249.178 Class C.  I didn't bother to try any 
other neighbouring Class Cs.

I can understand a few IP addresses of isolated machines not 
resolving to a domain name but not the whole Class C.  You should 
also be able to see the default gateway's domain name.  

Seems like this may be the site of some paranoid privacy loving 
folks.  If I have slandered any Cypherpunk and their company, who 
may be at least privacy loving, please accept my apologies in 
advance but please let me know if I made a mistake.
