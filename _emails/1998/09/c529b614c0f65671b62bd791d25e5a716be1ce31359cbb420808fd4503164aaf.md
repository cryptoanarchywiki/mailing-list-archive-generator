Name: Mark Salamon
spamhaven password: dumbshit

Congratulations Mark. You're well on your way to becoming a full
member of the Hall of Shame. Here is your member password: dumbshit. Use
it to log-in on the home page at the Spam Haven Web site,
http://www.sixdegrees.com. We'll ask you for a little more information to
complete your registration, like how many thousands of dollars in
resources you've stolen in your career, and then you'll be ready to start
networking.

It's important that you check your postal mail often, because it will only
hold so many magazine subscriptions. Your membership will not be complete
until you make yourself look even more clueless. 

Once you've successfully made an even bigger fool out of yourself, just go
to Personal Profile and you'll be able to choose your own password. We
suggest that you set it to something which describes your company, 
like "careless," "thief," "pathetic," or "spamhaven."

Thanks for becoming part of the Internet Hall of Shame. We're looking
forward to seeing you at the site.

====================================================================
PLEASE NOTE: You may receive many magazine subscriptions in the next 
few weeks. If you believe that you have been classed as a complete 
loser in error, go to a reputable company instead of a spam haven. 
Send all communications to Spamford at LWRules@BELLATLANTIC.NET and
someone will get back to you as soon as possible.
====================================================================
