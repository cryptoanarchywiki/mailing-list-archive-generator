IRS embarks on new era with taxpayer-friendly mission statement
Copyright (c) 1998 The Associated Press 

WASHINGTON (September 24, 1998 4:13 p.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) --
The Internal Revenue Service adopted a new official mission statement
emphasizing that "service" is its primary job.

In another step toward becoming more taxpayer-friendly, the IRS announced
Thursday a new statement that will be featured on its 1998 tax
publications, displayed at IRS offices and put on its Internet Web site.

The statement says that the IRS mission is to "provide America's taxpayers
top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax
responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to
all."

This replaces a 1980s statement in which the first line stated that the
IRS's main job was to "collect the proper amount of tax revenue at the
least cost."

"Words alone aren't going to change the IRS, but this serves an important
purpose," said IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti. "The mission statement
will be a reminder that we must be dedicated on a day-in, day-out basis to
serving taxpayers."

The change is one of many that have followed passage in Congress of an IRS
reform law aimed at moving the agency away from its heavy-handed past.
