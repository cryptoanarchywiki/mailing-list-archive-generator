Poor little Timmy, still crying boo-hoo because someone dared to set up
another list than his little cypherpunks fiefdom.  He loves to talk about
freedom of association if it means that he doesn't have to be around
"Coloreds".  But he can't stand people setting up a forum to focus more
on cryptography.  What a hypocrite.

Gee, and I thought they'd found possible bullet holes in Ron Brown's head?
Need more than a couple of pounds for that, wouldn't they?
