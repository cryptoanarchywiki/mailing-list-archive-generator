U.S. Spy Agency Helped U.S. Companies Win Business Overseas-Report

September 21, 1998

Nikkei English News: TOKYO (AP)--A U.S. intelligence agency
electronically eavesdropped on  foreign companies and passed
information to U.S. competitors to help them win business
overseas, a major Tokyo  newspaper reported Saturday.

The National Security Agency monitored phone calls, faxes and
electronic  mail  of European and Japanese companies since at
least 1990, the Mainichi  newspaper said, citing a report
Wednesday by the European Parliament, the European Union's
legislature.

The newspaper quoted the report as saying the NSA, in an
operation named "Echelon," used its vast eavesdropping network
to listen to business  negotiations.

The Central Intelligence Agency and British intelligence were
also involved, the paper said.

The paper said the report was submitted Wednesday to parliament
by its research bureau. Some of the findings also appeared in a
January report, the paper said.

In one case, the NSA monitored talks between French electronics
company Thomson-CSF and the Brazilian government over sale of a
radar system. An unnamed U.S. company ended up winning the
contract, the paper said.

The paper also said the NSA listened in on 1990 negotiations
between Japan's NEC Corp. and the Indonesian government over the
purchase of telecommunications machinery.

It used the information to urge Jakarta to award half the contract
to AT&T, the paper said.
