Actualy to be secure the subscriber would need to use one of the remailers
public key to encrypt their key prior to submission to the remailer. Of
course this doesn't prevent a MIT attack and key substitution. Otherwise
you'd be sending  your key in the clear, generaly a bad thing.

This touches on the main problem with distribution and use of PKE, in that
no secure key management protocal suitable for internet sort of
architectures has ever been developed that doesn't require some trusted 3rd
party or an existing secure channel.
