	I'll suggest that in a security context, having ones cake and
eating it too may not be such a bad thing.  If I can develop a
commercial product with crypto code thats been made available to the
community, then there is a lower chance the code will contain bogosity 
in its security critical functions.

	The GPL (not the LGPL) specifically prevents this with the
best of intentions.
