well, this is very interesting. Mitnick therefore represents
one of the first cases in which the govt is attempting
to compel keys. he's taken the 5th amendment against
giving the keys.

it looks to me like this: maybe mitnick had no backup of his
encrypted data. the FBI takes his laptop with all the
encrypted data. there may be some things in the data
that could tend to support his innocence-- but perhaps
there are other things that would tend to incriminate
him more than he already is.  so he wants the whole
set of data first, so he can make sure, without giving
the keys. the govt wants the whole set of data first, so they can 
make sure!! stalemate.

I think the govt does not have much of a case. it seems to
me that they should make the full contents of the laptop
available to the defense. it was mitnicks property. it
would be like them seizing someone's file cabinet. it
would be easy to make xerox's and return them to the
defendant.  but gosh, maybe with Rico that's too much of
a gracious act.
