Obviously you have a very high opinion of yourself and a low opinion of people
who use AOL.  Contrary to popular belief, there are a few intelligent people
on AOL, but it looks as if you are too egotistical to realize that.

Have you ever thought to look at your own mistakes before you publicize
everyone else's to the world?  Are you just suffering from some sort of
dillusion of grandeur - thinking you are better than everyone else.  Things
like this are what many wars were started over, I am so happy the internet
(hopefully) won't start a war in the real world.
