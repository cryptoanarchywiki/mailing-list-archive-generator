Actually there is somewhat more flexibility than this.  You made up the
padding, it didn't come from the file, did it?  You could add perhaps 1
more byte of FF without stretching credibility too extremely.  Then n
could be 1020 - 1032 bits.  It's too bad that s started out so small
(assuming the "true" n was 1024 bits).

But didn't YOU have to factor n also?  That's what you showed, originally,
a large s^e which you factored down to get some small factors and a big
one.  If you manage to get a prime factorization you can combine factors
to get your n.  But it won't be any harder for him to factor than it was
for you.

The discrete log algorithm is similar to quadratic sieve and other modern
factoring algorithms.  You do multiple factorizations of other numbers
and combine them to generate the desired relationships.  The difference
is that the factor base is not just the primes, it uses special numbers.

There was a break a few years ago of the discrete log modulus being
used by Sun's RPC.  This was something like 200-300 bits.  Maybe that
discrete log code could be obtained from the authors.
