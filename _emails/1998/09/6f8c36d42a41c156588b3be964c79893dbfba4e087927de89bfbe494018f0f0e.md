Of course, the guy who has the ball can argue, if he chooses to return it,
that it doesn't belong to him, and he's returning it to its owner,
the guy who made it worth $250K.  The IRS would have a hard time arguing
some legally-defined version of "finders keepers", since it was obvious
at any point whose ball it might be.

(Then there's the question of whether the ball really belongs to the
ballpark or one or the other team, and since most professional ballparks are
quasi-governmentally owned, the local government may want a large cut...)
				Thanks!
