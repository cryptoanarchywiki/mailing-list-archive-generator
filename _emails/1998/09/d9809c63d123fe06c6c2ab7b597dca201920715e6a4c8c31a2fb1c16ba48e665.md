I conclude:

A. There actually exist federal investigators who have nothing
   better to do with their lives than read the complete writings
   of the Performance Artists Sometimes Known as "Toto," and
   engage in endless mental masturbation over the hidden messages
   they imagine to be contained therein. 

B. When writing parody on the subject of AP, it is best not to 
   employ the names of actual federal slackers, lest the clueless
   investigators actually believe them to be targeted in some fashion. 

The part where he explains digital cash and how he clicked on the AP
Web Form almost rises to the AOL level of stupidity.  I'm amazed Arjen
Lenstra isn't in the slammer for the "DigiCrime" parody, given the
"knowlege and experience" of Mr. Investigator here.
