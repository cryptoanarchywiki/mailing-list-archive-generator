More formally, numbers and subtext that sound like statistical
terminology but do not follow proper statistical procedures concerning
sampling of the population and non-biased criteria can be formulated to
say whatever one wshed to be said.  The "statistics" in this case are of
that nature.  (That is the techie translation of the quote given above.)

Precisely what part of the "statistician's" garbage Should Have Been
Included?  It held no structure to be subdivided, nor did it have
immensely valuable protions to be directly commented upon.  In point of
fact, the total quote methodology was used in "protest" of his
classifying non-quotes as clueless.  The appropriate proportion to be
quoted is a matter of taste and understandability.

In actuallity, AOL EMail allows for either quoting style to be used.

And I suppose that it would be appropriate for me to take out my feeling
for everyting that anyone running or using an anonymous remailer does on
anyone who uses, runs, or support anonymous remailers?

I repeat:And what I said was along the lines of most were justified, but
some
         showed his lack of clues.
We both said the same thing, except you said questionable and I said
showed lack of clues.

I have never defended a spam site to my knowledge.  sixdegrees was not
spam.  It was a requested service.  It's just that the requester was not
authorized to make the request.  My commentary amounted to attack the
offending party, not the other offended parties.

Actually, the baby porn I referred to was purportedly posted by Timothy
C May.

Actually, neither.  I don't like lies and I don't like seeing the wrong
people get battered for wrongdoings.  I do find it mildly amusing that
noone posted anything to the jerk that signed up as Joe Cypherpunk. 
(That one definitely lives under a bridge.)
