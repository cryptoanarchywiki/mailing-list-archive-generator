No Netscape on NT or 95/98 is no where near as stable as on a Linux or
Solaris box (the two that I use most). I can't go 24 hours on my NT for
example without Netscape hanging for some mysterious reason whereas I've
run Netscape (even on my HP 10.10) for days without a hang and those
mysterious pauses it's so famous for.

Yep, that explains why my NT's have to be rebooted almost daily because of
various issues and my various unix boxes go for weeks....yep, that's more
stable all right.

How do you figure Win98 gives me more value for my money? I buy Win98 for
$100 or so, have to have gobs of memory and a damned fast processor to even
come close to the alternate OS'es.

Only becuase they intentionly go after the smaller companies and create
various issues (eg the DrDos intentional break) that nearly guarantee that
smaller firms are out before they even start.

You have a penchant for random wandering....
