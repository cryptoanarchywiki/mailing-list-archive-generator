"Yes, the president should resign.  He has lied to the American people,
time and time again, and betrayed their trust.  Since he has admitted guilt,

possible solution is for the president to save some dignity and resign."

- From 12th Congressional District Hopeful William Jefferson Clinton
during the Nixon investigations
