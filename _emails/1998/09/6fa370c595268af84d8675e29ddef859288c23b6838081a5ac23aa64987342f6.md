Good post. The war is about to be joined.

Agreed. The chickens are coming home to roost. America will get what it
deserves. I figure the Y2K problem will be the most significant trigger
event.

See "A Clockwork Orange" for details. Today's Ebonics kids will be
tomorrow's Droogs.

The inner cities will burn. 10 million ethnics will wipe themselves out.
White America (and Asian America, who are honorary whites, by the
University of California's admissions standards) will cluck, but will watch
the inner cities burn themselves out with only a "I told you so" attitude.
Miami, Chicago, Washington, LA, New York, Atlanta, New Orleans, and a dozen
other cities will be like Berlin after the war.

Freedom fighters, not terrorists.

Local justice, not vigilantism. OJ and You Know Who hanged side by side.
Several million welfare thieves given  the choice of hard labor for 20 or
so years, to repay the money they stole, or a bullet to the head. Their
choice.

Yes, more and more of my wealthy friends are doing this. Most of them are
moving to the country, where defenses are more naturally provided, and not
necessarily moving to gate communities (which are actually quite
indefensible when the welfare addicts and gangbangers start rioting and
dancing.)

"Snow Crash."

Has already happened. The National Police Force is already mobilized
against religious groups which are deemed unacceptable, pace the Branch
Davidians.

Burn the prisons with the inmates locked inside. Then simply execute those
who commit the most serious crimes.

Posse comitatus is already becoming a moot point. The Army will be
patrolling the streets within a few years, probably coterminous with Y2K
problems and the resulting martial law.

Militias and freedom fighters will have to start hitting U.S. military
installations. Many will die. Eventually the military will abandon the
Washington elite and will join the freedom fighters.

Ten million politicians and welfare thieves will be put up against the wall.
