6161234432565677 possibilities for up to 8 printable-characters (roughly 2^52)

217180147133 poss. for up to 8 lowercase letters (roughly 2^38)

54507958502609 poss. for up to 8 lower/upper letters (roughly 2^46)

221919451578029 poss. for up to 8 alphanumeric chars. (roughly 2^48)

Apparently, the password can be up to 80 printable characters in length...

90119714237357 possibilities worst-case (roughly 2^524)

According to one of the READMEs that comes with a public domain
implementation of the PKZIP crypto algorithm, there is a known-plaintext
attack against it described at http://www.cryptography.com/.

If it's 8 or less lower-case letters, it would seem that it's probably
crackable in a reasonable amount of time on a high-end desktop PC or
workstation.  Anything more would probably require a distributed attack.

Never believe that you know the whole story.
