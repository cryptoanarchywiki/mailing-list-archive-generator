I hope http://www.jya.com/itl-news.htm enjoys black and white.

"complex mathematical formulae"  aka  pseduomathematics

  Then, in late 1942, the Royal Navy switched codes to the one-time
  pad system. The Nazi tap was lost forever because the
  pad system is unbreakable in both theory as well as practice.
  U-boats could no longer ambush helpless ships like wolves on
  sheep. Convoy after convoy arrived safe and intact, protected in the  
  armor of an unbreakable code system. The U-boats had
  to change tactics. http://www.us.net/softwar/

  Germany used the enigma algorithm and machine.

  Japan used the purple algorithm.

  And look what happened to them!

I hope all of this helps Charles R Smith's business.
