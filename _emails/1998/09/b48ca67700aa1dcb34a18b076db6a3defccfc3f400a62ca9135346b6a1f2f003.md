Yes, many farmers and others left the war zone  in 1948 to stay with
relatives and friends and such in safer areas. Can anyone blame them?

Ah, but now they and their children and grandchildren and
great-grandchildren live in tents in refugee camps for a simple reason:
they were not allowed to return to their homes and land.

Did this vacation in Jordan or Egypt or Lebanon or wherever mean they lost
the title to their homes and land? Apparently the newly arrived transplants
from Poland and Latvia and such felt this to be the case.

This is comparable to my going to Oregon to escape the Reconquista Wars in
California, and returning a few months later to find the borders sealed.
(Issues that those who departed may have fallen behind in mortgage payments
and had their farms repossesed by banks, etc., are clearly separable...and
minor, from my readings of Middle Eastern history.)

Oregon-California border. Meanwhile, your ranch is now my ranch. Oh, and
could give me all of your spare keys? And how does the sprinkler system
work?"

Israel is based on moral bankruptcy. The supposed guilt of the West (huh?
we didn't gas the Jews, and we lost millions of lives fighting Hitler) led
to the "ragheads" being kicked off their land.
