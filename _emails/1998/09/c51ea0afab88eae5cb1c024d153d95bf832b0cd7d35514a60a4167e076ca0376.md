These are quotes from a mil news group where this is being 
discussed.

"Thing is, many of the Army's sites offered a wealth of
information, unclassified, and readily available in hardcopy,
to anybody who wants it.

To ease distribution and save millions in costs of distributing
this material around the world, the Web cannot be beat,
as even Hamre's directive emphasized for contracting and 
purchasing defense goods and educating its personnel.

An West Point bozo fucked up royally by pissing an arc to show Hamre
the combat guys know how to blow shit away big time -- the turkey
was named in some news reports, a LtGen of Info Services -- and revelaed
his prejudice toward loathsome civvy control and wily-hackered the 
whole damn system, "stupid jerk, fucking asshole, eat shit, fuck you,"
as my sqawk box mocks.

Hamre will get hammered for overreacting, too, he's been whining
about cyber threats for months now, when it's clear he doesn't
know shit about such systems, like most of the wrinkled fucks running
the natsec operation. They won't listen to the youngsters under
their command, they just want to destroy something to prove their
hardware prowess, being unable to wave their shriveled dicks now
that they'll get cashiered for being inappropriately related to
underlings.

It will cost the military millions if not billions to return to a closed 
information system. And all those folks who were selling handy
off the shelf stuff for ballooning mil siles aint gonna keep quiet -- 
unless they get sweetheart deals for 10 times cost for secret shit that
aint worth shit to anybody except the lard asses always screaming
for more protection for the Amercian people."
