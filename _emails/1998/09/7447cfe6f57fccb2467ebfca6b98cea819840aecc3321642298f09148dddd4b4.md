A legal prohibition isn't a licensing restriction, it's a distribution
restriction. A license restriction defines who can use a product and
under what terms they may do so legaly, it doesn't address where they
may use it legaly.

If you tried to put a license restriction that said "can only be used in
the US" *then* you would be correct. It isn't the copyright holders choice
and therefore they're not responsible for it per se. Not to mention that
it would be very hard to support legaly.

A good example is I have a military book that says that you can only
possess the book in the US and Canada...try to enforce that one.

Were that the case Phil Z. would be sittin in a hoosgow right now.

Personaly, I like the idea of printing your source out and sending it to
HackTick for typing in and reposting. That wouldn't effect your initial
licensing restrictions and bypasses the restrictions handily.
