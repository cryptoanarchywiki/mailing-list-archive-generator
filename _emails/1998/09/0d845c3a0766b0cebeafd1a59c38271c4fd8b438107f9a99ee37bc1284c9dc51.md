Bob,

Concerning the recent posting by Jim Donald about micropayments,
let me say that as a co-inventor of a micropayment scheme
(presented at the FC'97 conference) I do see a role for them.
However, I do think it will be a limited role.  The reason
is economic.  It is not just that people don't want to be
"nickeled and dimed."  A more substantive reason is that in
most situations the content producers can get more money
from aggregating content.  I have analyzed this in papers
such as

The bumpy road of electronic commerce, in "WebNet 96 - World
Conf. Web Soc. Proc.," H. Maurer, ed., AACE, 1996, pp. 378-389.

and

Fixed fee versus unit pricing for information goods: competition,
equilibria, and price wars, P. C. Fishburn, A. M. Odlyzko, and
R. C. Siders, First Monday 2(7) (July 1997), http://www.firstmonday.dk/.
Also to appear in "Internet Publishing and Beyond: The Economics of
Digital Information and Intellectual Property," D. Hurley, B. Kahin,
and H. Varian, eds., MIT Press, 1998.

Both are available at

Best regards,
Andrew
