   Horde This Book
   By Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)

   Book Review America's computers crashed on January 1, 2000. Cars won't
   start, planes won't fly, and the military is in shambles. Soldiers of
   unknown origin have seized control of a key high-tech company. China
   is about to invade. The one man who can save Western civilization from
   a Digital Dark Age is Y2K fixmeister Mark Solvang. Mark's problem?
   Well, it happens to be his company those troops took over. What comes
   next is a predictable romp through gun battles, hacking, and
   government intrigue that's sure to satisfy Chuck Norris fans but leave
   anyone else hoping for more.
