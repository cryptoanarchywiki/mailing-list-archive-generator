>    LONDON (IDG) -- European countries should cooperate with the U.S. to
>    create an Internet that is regulated by the industry rather than by
>    governments, said Ira Magaziner, senior adviser to U.S. President Bill
>    Clinton for Internet policy development, at The Wall Street Journal
>    Europe's Fifth Annual CEO Summit on Converging Technologies.
>    
>    "We are trying to come to an agreement with the European Union where
>    they recognize our approach," said Magaziner, a speaker at the
>    conference here today.
>    
>    He outlined the importance of the Internet to the U.S. and world
>    economies and said that it was not up to governments to attempt to
>    control Internet use and commerce. Magaziner attributed one-third of
>    all economic growth in the U.S. to the building of the Internet. But,
>    he warned, "if goods are overtaxed or overregulated, it's hard to do
>    business. The private sector should lead."
>    
>    Governments are ill-equipped to handle the Internet, because it
>    changes too rapidly, it's too decentralized and too international,
>    suggested Magaziner.
>    
>    "The digital age moves too quickly for government action," he said.
