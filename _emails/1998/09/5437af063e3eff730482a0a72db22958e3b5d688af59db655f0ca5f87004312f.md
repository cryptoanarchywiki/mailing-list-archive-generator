Let's see, Starr's inquiries into Clinton sex life *could* be seen, by a
sympathetic onlooker, as a very elaborate trap which angered Clinton
sufficiently that he became careless and fell into it. This leads to the
resounding cries of "if he lied UNDER OATH about his *S*E*X* life what
ELSE is he lying to us about?" This is OK because the investigation was
carried out under a legal authority.

Meanwhile, back in Congress, the Republicans are decrying Hyde's
affair's disclosure as a horrible, unwarranted attack with the intent to
"intimidate and obstruct justice" and the Parties are trying to cover
their own asses by declaring a truce regarding smear campaigns and dirt
digging. So, this type of disclosure by civilians through a *free* press
is "wrong" and should be prevented.

Scorch on, I say. If they are afraid to have us dig into their
extramarital affairs what else are they hiding from us? Tobacco deals,
arms deals, kickbacks, pageboys? How deep is this dirt they're covering
up?

The only downside is that after the shit has all fallen to earth the
only persons who will dare to run for office under the new rules of
engagement will be worse than what we have now even if they're
squeaky-clean from a morals perspective.

Mike
