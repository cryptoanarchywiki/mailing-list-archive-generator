DoD's latest standard for protection against electromagnetic
effects, MIL-STD-464, "Electromagnetic Environmental Effects
-- Requirements for Systems," provides a bare 17 pages of dry
prescriptions for the official standard, then 90 astonishing pages 
of ways the standard is to be applied in addressing unexpected
EM misfortunes, like ordance spontaneously exploding, planes
crashing, ships out of control, radar meltdown, personnel fried, 
and so on.

What comes out of this critical "anecdotal" material, not yet 
subject to precise standardization, is what Tesla learned early 
this century: the dreadful power of accumulated, boosted EM 
caused by unexpected interaction of human electronic inventions 
and natural EM forces. Such as some speculate brought down 
TWA 800.

What also comes out is that each unit of every major weapons 
system, theirs and ours (and civilian devices) can be identified 
by its unique EM  "fingerprint" -- nuclear sub, B1B, F117, AF One, 
your family Sports-ute, your chattering computer, cellphone and 
pager. As if anyone except the NSA can siphon and sort through 
them all, the compromising emanations are Out There awaiting
receivers of secret messages unintentionally sent.

A loud and clear message is that electronification of culture is
causing a build-up of powerful latent lightning looking for a ground
to blast, a sub to sink, a bomber to shatter. Be prepared for a 
technological attack, to be blamed on terrorists, but really caused 
by the expected EM effects Tesla warned about.
