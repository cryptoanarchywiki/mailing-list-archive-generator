| As I am getting a cable modem installed today, I'd like to set up a free remailer service for the internet community. I have a static IP, good disk space and my machine is located in Norway. Ideally I'd like to do something along the lines of anon.penet.fi. Any tips or suggestions are most welcome, but I'm *not* setting up a warez/porn site or anything like that.
