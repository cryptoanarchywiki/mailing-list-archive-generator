This from the AZ court docket of September 2 (note the out of sequence

The AZ docket is archived at:

   http://jya.com/cej090298.htm

We also got today the Western Washington court docket which
shows when CJ's arrest warrant was issued and sealed, August 5:

   http://jya.com/cej082298.htm

We did a quick check of the WA court's cases for others (TCM and JYA)
who may have a sealed arrest warrant in force, but found none. But if 
there are any they may not be entered in the public record yet, as with
Carl's performance artistry.
