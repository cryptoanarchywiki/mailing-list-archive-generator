Wake up America! Encryption doesn't kill people!  Terrorists do.
Would you give the keys to your house to the government? Just in
case they have to break in? NO!  How about your ATM PIN #, just in case
you don't pay your taxes? NO! So don't give out your keys that you use
for
encrpytion and don't let the government have a way to get them either!

Just say NO to the UNCONSTITUTIONAL idea of Limited Privacy! After all,
we are not COMMUNISTS.
