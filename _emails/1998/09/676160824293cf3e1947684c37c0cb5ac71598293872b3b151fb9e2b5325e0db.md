Two Reporters Attacked at Governor's Rally*
***********************************************

	This morning two Free Press Reporters at Governor George
Bush's Rally at the Du Pont Factory in Round Rock Texas were
assaulted and silenced from questioning Gov. Bush, while asking
pertinent questions.  Questions specifically about the CFR and
Federal Reserve involvement in Texas and the US.  No response was
given and orders were immediately given to the Secret Service and
Texas DPS, to remove the reporters.

 Alex Jones Alex@989kjfk.com "Talk Radio Show Host for KJFK 98.9
FM" [www.989kjfk.com] Austin and Central Texas and "Republic National
Radio Broadcasting System" and his Producer Mike Hansen of the Austin
Access TV Show "Exposing Corruption" Channel 10 ACTV were grabbed and
roughed up and removed from the rally by force.  Alex Jones was
forceably arrested and taken away and later released by a radio call
to the police unit.  The radio transmission instructed the officers
to release Alex Jones.  Governor Bush had ordered his release
stating, they had nothing to hold him on.  Mike Hansen while filming
the incident was hit from behind in an attempt to break his camera. 
The blow thrown from behind nearly knocked Hansen off his feet.  Mike
Hansen was not near the scuffle or in the area, he was filming from a
distance.  Both men received injuries.

	Not only were their 1st Amendment rights trampled and
forceable abridged by the Secret Service and DPS agents but their
questions were ignored, questions that are very important to voters. 
Evidentially these questions, that many of Governor Bush's
constituents are asking, were not address by our Governor, and
possible President hopeful.  The Question were about the Federal
Reserve control of our currency and it's role in the perpetuation of
oppressive debt in our country.  The active part the CFR (Council on
Foreign Relations) are playing in the take over and control of our
Country and their role in movement toward the New World Order.

	People expect the same accountability from the Governor, that
Governor Bush has been talking about in his campaign advertisements. 
Why were these citizens attacked?  Why were these questions so
offensive?  A Public Servant should be able to stay cool and have an
interest in all of his constituents and all their concerns.  If our
leadership will not calmly answer honest questions, it leads us as
responsible informed voters to ask questions of ourselves.  Why
aren't all of Governor Bush's constituents concerns and views
addressed?  Are special interest views and concerns, more valid or
more important than the majority of people and voters?  Is our
leadership truly representing "We the People" if they have someone
removed that asks a controversial question?
