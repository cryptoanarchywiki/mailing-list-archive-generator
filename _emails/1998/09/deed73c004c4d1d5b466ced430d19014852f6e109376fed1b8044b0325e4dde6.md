Good piece, Declan. Is Time getting access to the restricted
Congressional Web site which offers the Starr report early for
members only drooling? Or are the major mediums getting
preferential copies in concert with the deliberately under-provided
House/Thomas/GPO rigs?

These are the four public access sites given by the NYT today,
which notes that no one yet knows the digital format -- text,
word processor or PDF images:

    http://www.house.gov/icreport/ (House Information Resources) 

    http://www.house.gov/judiciary (House Judiciary Committee) 

    http://thomas.loc.gov/icreport/ (Library of Congress) 

    http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/icreport/ (Government Printing Office) 

If its PDF then the delay is surely deliberately planned to favor
those with scratchback access.
