Ah hem! To quote myself:

    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By "this" I mean the method of not allowing access to the hidden cylinders.  By
deactivating, I mean disabling the routine that hides the hidden cylinders,
thus letting you access the partition.

This means that you wouldn't be typing in the special passphrase in front of
the Customs official.  

It means that when >YOU< wish to use your encrypted partition (in the privacy
of your hotel root), you would type in the passphrase to activate it's
visibility and accesibility to the rest of your machine.  

Further that BY DEFAULT, the hidden space on the drive (preferably a partition)
would normally not be reported by the bios hiding the true number of cylinders
from the OS's.

How?  You won't type in the passphrase in front of them.   You'll let the bios
do its thing and HIDE the extra partion from their scanner.
