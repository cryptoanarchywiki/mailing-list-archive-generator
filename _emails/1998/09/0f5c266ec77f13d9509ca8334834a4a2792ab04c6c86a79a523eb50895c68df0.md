No I don't. I can start a business for as little as $15 to register a DBA
and I don't need licenses or other sorts of regulatory permissions. If I
sell a product or service (some are exempt, check your local area) I'll need
a tax number to pay my state sales tax (though they do nothing to regulate
my business other than specify that I must pay x% of my sales to the
community). Getting that tax number is free. Outside of that (at least in
Texas) I'm ready to go.

Yep, that's a lot of regulation, no forms or permission slips from some
in loco parentis, no reports or annual fees.

No we shouldn't. The fact that monopolies can exist in this lightly
regulated economy is ample evidence that the non-regulated or free-market
theory is nothing more than another pie-in-the-sky utopian dream.
Unrealistic and unrealizable.

If you seriously think this is a heavily regulated market you should do more
research into such places as Nazi Germany, Russia, China, etc.

Monopolies are monopolies, claiming that they will be less abusive in a
regulated market than in a free-market just demonstrates a lack of
understanding of basic human instincts.

You are claiming that if we do away with the food regulations that McDonalds
will be *more* concerned about their meat being cooked thoroughly then you
obviously don't understand people who chase the bottem line to the exclusion
of all else.

If a market monopolizes there is *NO* competition. If the market is one that
takes a large investment in intellectual or capital materials then there
won't be any opportunity to even attempt to start a competitive venture.

Fairness is about the consumer, not the manufacturer. This misunderstanding
(if not intentional misdirection) by free-market mavens is at least one
indication why it won't work.

> competition. Make it a contractually issue and not a criminal one,

Contractual with who?

> reputation for punishment instead of life and liberty, 

Businesses are neither alive nor do they enjoy liberty. Don't confuse people
with systems and objects.
