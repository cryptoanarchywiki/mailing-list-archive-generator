    no, Lazlo...  don't be naive; "The People" dont have any say.

    "Someone else," aka "Flagship" == "Geo. Bush"

    I said (documented) in 1986 during Reagan's presidency:

	Geo. Bush will be the last American President to 
	complete his elected term of office.

    Geo. Bush had not yet been elected President...

	attila out...     	(Arkancide?)


    ~~~	absolutely incredible article; a perfect description and
	analysis of our Virtual President, Bill "Bubba" Clinton.
	and, hopefully he takes the Virtual Agenda Hillary with
	him.

	Missy Kelly deserves at least a Pulitzer prize for this one!
	and Joseph Farah, publisher of World News Daily, shows that 
	he has what it takes to lead the fourth estate.

	    attila out...   	(for real)
