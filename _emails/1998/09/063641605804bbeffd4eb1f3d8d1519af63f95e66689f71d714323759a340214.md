1.  As a matter of fact, I do try to take the moral high ground -- in
all things.  Sorry, it was how I was raised and I do not intend to swith
to seeking the immoral low ground.
2.  I have Never said to embrace and cherish the idiots from AOL.  Just
that some of the actions I have seen are much closer to the immoral low
ground.

I do not mean to Defend AOL except from misinformation -- BTW some of
the characteristics attributed to AOL and its software show a great deal
of clueneediness on the part of the "authors" or a need for
reaquaintance with the truth if the folk actually have a clue and
deciuded to spread "other stuff" instead.  OTOH I do try to defend the
innocents be they from AOL or elsewhere from the repercussions of the
spamming scum that (among other things) started the whole sixdegres
episode.

I read his classification criteria closely, and read the results of the
classification process.

If funny is all you want, may I recommend rec.humor.funny and, in case
you are up on no current events but Clinton, rec.humor.funny.reruns.

And to the brilliant person seeking muff diving pics, gee send a real
address and we'll see what we can do.  (At least he didn't want it for
pre-muff variety.)
