1. it's tough to argue that clinton's apparent perjury in Jones was
immaterial

2. i know of no law saying perjury only a crime if it's "material"

3. perjury is certainly one of the "great offenses" that common law says
is impeachable.

4. besides, non-criminal activities can constitute impeachable offenses --
look at second and third articles of impeachment in Nixon's case
