Oh, yes another guy to give it up so easily!  Now look, why is it that you
let these people tease me with Monica Lewinsky and kiddie porn, and
then take them away from me just as quickly?!  WHAT THE HELL KIND
OF SERVICE ARE YOU RUNNING?!?!??!  Don't you like kiddie porn?
Don't you want to have sex with Monica, just like the prez?

And you tell that cactus humper Christopher "I like little boys" Barkley
to watch his caboose!  The FBI are going to be after him like cheese
on a stick when they find out that Mr. I Have Lotion In My Pants goes
in for children-with-llamas bestiality like he does.  What a maroon!
