Actualy this is a straw man. Very few Christians claim Buddhist, Muslim,
etc. are satan worshipers, Satan is a Christian ephigy. What they *do*
claim is that those folks are worshipping false idols and as a result
won't gain access to heaven at death.

Vasty different than your claim.

There's your first problem, your argument won't stand in the traditional
architecture of society so you want to try to get me to throw it away.
This causes all terms, ideas, etc. to become irrelevant in effect forcing
me to play from a vacuum. Won't do it. Though it's a nice ploy on your
part.

> in today's reality most atheists simply forgo
> religion completely.

A personal philosophy is a religion, different words but same idea. If your
thesis is that for something to be a religion it requires some sort of
social approval you miss the whole point. Even Jesus recognized that a
persons religion didn't rely on a 'church' and the implied infrastructure.
This is the reason he told his listeners to pray in a closet alone.

There is no reason to believe one doesn't either. If we take your claim at
face value you need to demonstrate your test that shows the irrelevancy
of god. God is not a belief in a negative, another straw man, but rather
a mechanism or expression of human psychology and the need for humans to
find patterns (ie reason) in things.

Ah, another of your mistakes. Religion and by extension faith are not
constrained by reason or logic. It's this realisation that puts some
issues and aspect of human inquiry outside of the reach of science, logic,
etc.

If you're a pantheist they're the only religion (aka personal philosophy)
you've got. Shortcomings in your imagination are not a reflection upon the
rest of the cosmos.

No, only some religions are irrational. The point you're missing is not
one of rationality or irrationality but rather transcendance.
