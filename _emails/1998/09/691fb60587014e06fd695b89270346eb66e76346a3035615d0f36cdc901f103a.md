Web-based products which help individuals build their own virtual communities based on their personal and professional
relationships. sixdegrees, located on the Web at http://www.sixdegrees.com, allows members to uncover the power of their

relationships, sixdegrees offers several proprietary applications, all of which help members leverage their own trusted network
of contacts. Since its launch in January of 1997, sixdegrees members have been able to make new contacts quickly and easily,
gain valuable help and information and communicate directly with their own growing virtual community, all within the confines
of the sixdegrees property. As of December 1997, there were over 250,000 sixdegrees members who had listed over
930,000 contacts in the sixdegrees database.
