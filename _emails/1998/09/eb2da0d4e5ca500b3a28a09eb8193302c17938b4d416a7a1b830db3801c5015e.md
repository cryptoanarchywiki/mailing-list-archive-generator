There are quite a few commercial apps built for the GNU environment,
Wordperfect, Applixware, at least 2 X-window environments, etc.

The way to program for the GNU license in the commercial world is not to
use the libraries and such directly but rather built the necessary stubs
into the GPL code. That they'll be there when you (and potentialy others
might need them).

In the case of GNU/cash for example the trick is not to build the crypt into
the app but rather built the necessary *general* stubs in that allow access
to the data flow. Then a user can put a mulitplicity of packages onto the
appropriate stubs as they desire. This would allow a couple of individuals
for example to build a micro-e$ system to track their CD trades/borrows or
whatever (contrived but exemplary). This could be applied in more commercial
ventures within the context of e$ tokens that could be used within that
business for purchases (pawn shops, video arcades, movie rentals, etc.
might find this useful) that are currently physical token or credit based.
