I think the something at the WH has pushed them off the edge. How much you want to bet that it gives a lot more information than just the item costs. It will be used to police obscenity laws and censorship laws before it is done.

Ira Magaziner, President Clinton's senior Internet advisor, has proposed a 
new plan for tracking and taxing goods sold over the Internet that would use 
electronic "resident cards" and private-sector escrow agents around the 
world. Consumers would obtain digital cash at banks that would allow 
merchants to identify which country the buyer is in, but would reveal no 
other personal information. Consumption taxes would then be calculated, 
collected, and placed with an escrow agent who would then funnel the money 
to the appropriate government. "Governments would get their money more 
quickly... they would get a higher compliance rate... and the system would 
be easier to police," says Mr. Magaziner. (Wall Street Journal 11 Sep 98)
