  dont want to take the time to look up the 18 USC reference, but
  providing deliberately false information to _any_ federal agent 
  is a felony--  that includes the IRS. if nothing else, such as
  telling a federal agent to fuck-off, they will charge you with
  obstruction of justice.
  
  for all who think the Bill of Rights really means something, 
  consider:
  
    silence 		obstruction of justice
    false information	lying to a federal agent in course of ...
    ...
  
  too many to list; also, each of the regulatory agencies have
  their own courts and regulations which usurp the Congressional
  mandate for legislation of the Constitution. The regulatory
  courts have broad powers and their decisions, both criminal and
  civil, can be entered in Federal District Court; you, of course,
  have right of review in Federal District Court, for what that is
  worth --by the time you get that far in the procedings, you're
  out of money for the mandatory lawyers the original 13th amendment
  was created to prevent --the government has confiscated your
  property without due process, and before "conviction" under the
  seizure laws which permit them to grab assets at the time of
  the arrest --even if you are acquitted, there is little if any
  guarantee your property will be restored --if in the meantime
  it is sold at 10 cents on the dollar at auction, you may be 
  entitled to that dime.
  
  welcome to democracy in action.
  
  	attila out....
