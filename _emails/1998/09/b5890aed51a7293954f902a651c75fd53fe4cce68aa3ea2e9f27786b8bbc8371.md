Go to a bookstore and buy an introductory book on C programming. It might
cost as much as $50, but it is more than worth your while if you are
planning on messing with cryptography and cracking like this.

Once you have the book, read it and then try to analyze the source code. 
If you are dealing with and using Windows, you will need a C compiler. 
Cygnus has a free Win32 C compiler out as I understand it, and Microsoft
and Borland both have C compilers out for a few hundred bucks each.

If you are dealing with UNIX, there is tons of source and free development
utilities out there.
