If Microsofts actions were prohibitive and they didn't set out with specific
intentions of denying fair competition (there have been quite a few
documents and transcripts released that show this pre-meditated intent) then
it wouldn't need to.

The reality is that we don't live in a free-market, but rather a rather
lightly regulated one. Microsoft got a tad too greedy in fixing their
software so that specific competitors would not be able to use it, this in
itself may not be a crime. However it *does* deny the consumer the choice
and that most certainly is a crime.
