I suppose one should not forget one aspect if AES is to become an
ISO standard. There will be different implementations but one
needs validations. For compilers there are validation centres
run by certain institutes authorized by some national standard
organizations (certificates of validation are issued). Similar 
facilities should be assured for the future AES. Implementation 
as such can't in my opinion be a big problem outside of US.
