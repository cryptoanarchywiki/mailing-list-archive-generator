Sure they do. They can use a different mail reader. (After all, 32-bit AOL
allows AOL users to use all the TCP/IP protocols...) They can cut and
paste manually, or, probably best, they can go to another ISP. 

I understand what you're saying, Ryan, and I understand what they're
saying, but there all alternatives out there; they just don't want to use
them. In fact, they've installed proprietary packages that do this. There
are plenty of free alternatives out there which don't have this problem.

If my ISP pushed a bunch of proprietary software down my throat, I'd find
another ISP. That goes double if the proprietary software sucks. That goes
triple if the software sucks and the ISP is trying to get every idiot they
can to use it. (I got a "100 hours free network abuse" disk in the mail
recently from AOL.)
