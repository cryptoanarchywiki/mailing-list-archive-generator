   Blacklisted Spam Victim Wants His Day in Court 
   By Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
                                         
   When Craig Harmer got spammed, he did what all of us should do: he
   fired off a nasty email to the perp and the perp's Internet provider.
   "I was trying to get his web site connectivity yanked," says Harmer, a
   35-year old Unix programmer who didn't really think much of it at the
   time. But the spammer remembered. Harmer says someone named Michael
   Reed was behind the bulk email, and accuses Reed of retaliating by
   using Harmer's Internet site as a mail relay, pumping megabytes of
   forged sex spam through it and letting Harmer take the rap.
