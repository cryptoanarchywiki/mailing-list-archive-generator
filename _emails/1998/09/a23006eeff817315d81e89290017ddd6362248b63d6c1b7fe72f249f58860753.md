I suppose we need more altruistic gestures placing good stuff into the
public domain.

The security is only between the handset and the base unit. Once the
signal hits the POTS it's the same old story - open line.

ALSO - the channels and the hopping sequence used in the
"spread-spectrum" systems are predefined. Kind of like making a stream
cipher with a very short bitstream you got from the government printing
orifice. Using any other sequence is a crime.

The real purpose of the spread spectrum phones is to allow increased
signal levels. The security is not robust.

Try this one:

Not particularly original - I would guess that Tim's 3DES phone is
something like this.

Wal Mart Plastics for the housing ( ever tooled plastics? $$$ )
Custom board
	Dedicated DSP for voice compression/decompression
	Modem chipset for POTS connect ( direct or ISP )
	Fast microP for encryption/protocol
	Any encryption algorithm you desire
	Software Developer's Kit ( roll your own algorithm )

This will work very nicely at home or with any cell phone that has a
modem port. It's really nothing but a dedicated version of a PC based
PGP phone. It's just smaller and cheaper than a PC and has no MS DLLs on
it.

Regards,
Mike
