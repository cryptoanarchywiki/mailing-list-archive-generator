There is another powerful tool for surreptitiously intercepting
data, but it is only available to law enforcement and the
military. Called DIRT (Data Interception and Remote
Transmission), it was released in June by Codex Data Systems.
http://www.thecodex.com/dirt.html

Investigators need only know your e-mail address to secretly
install the program. Once they do, investigators can read your
documents, view your images, download your files and intercept
your encryption keys. DIRT was developed to assist law
enforcement in pedophilia investigations, but future uses could
include drug investigations, money laundering cases and
information warfare.
