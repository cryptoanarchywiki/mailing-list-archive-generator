Data Fellows Introduces F-Secure NameSurfer Version 2.0   

SAN JOSE, CA -- Data Fellows, the global leader in Internet security
solutions, has today announced the new version 2.0 of its F-Secure
NameSurfer DNS (Domain Name System) management tool. 

DNS translates host names to IP addresses and is a critical component of
any IP based network. F-Secure NameSurfer provides network managers an
easy- to-use Web interface for DNS administration, saving time and
maintenance resources. Its intuitive graphical user interface and automatic
error checking prevent network managers from generating faulty DNS data.
Faulty DNS data can bring down the entire IP network, so correctness of DNS
data is essential for reliable and secure Internet and intranets. 

F-Secure NameSurfer 2.0 has been extensively restructured to achieve
peerless performance in the markets, especially in large DNS installations.
The new version also makes it possible to prevent the network manager from
creating address records whose IP address falls outside his own network.
Thus, ISPs can give their customers the permission to change addresses and
still be sure that customers stay in their own network zone. 

F-Secure NameSurfer translates into significant savings in network
management. The intuitive graphical user interface saves network managers'
time in doing DNS configurations. The configurations can be done remotely
and by multiple network managers with personal administration rights. The
routine tasks can be delegated to clerical staff. Ultimately even end-users
or ISP customers can administer their own DNS data, with a Web browser, as
a self-service. 

Prime target customer groups for F-Secure NameSurfer are telecommunication
operators, Internet Service Providers (ISP), and other organizations that
need the best tool in the markets to manage Internet or intranet security.
Among F-Secure NameSurfer customers are ISPs like US WEST INTERACT,
Concentric Network Corporation, and The Finnish University and Research
Network, as well as international corporate customers such as Barclays Bank
PLC, Motorola Semiconductor Product Services, and UPM-Kymmene.

F-Secure NameSurfer 2.0 is now available from Data Fellows' resellers
around the world. The product is available for all the popular Unix
platforms. Pricing starts at $990.

With offices in San Jose, CA, and Helsinki, Finland, privately-owned Data
Fellows is the leading technology provider of data security solutions for
computer networks and desktop computers. The company's F-Secure data
security product line includes the groundbreaking F-Secure Anti-Virus,
which facilitates two of the world's best scanning engines, F-PROT
Professional and AVP, within the same system for unparalleled virus
detection rates; F-Secure SSH for securing all popular TCP/IP applications;
and F-Secure VPN for creating secure virtual private networks. The
company's products are relied on by many of the world's largest companies,
governments, universities and institutions. The products are available

partners.
