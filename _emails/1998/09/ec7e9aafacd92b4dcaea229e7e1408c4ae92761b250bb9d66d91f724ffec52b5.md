(Wed, 23 Sep 1998 Subject: a few impressions on the rallye)

[snip]
    - Quebec is waking up and joining in

    - the ban on "purse-sized" pepper spray -- that says it all.

    -   60 millions/year forever for gun control bureaucrats,
         4 millions/year for 5 years for cancer research

        38 women murdered with a firearm last lyear  
      3900 women died of breast cancer last year
        if this is not a feminist issue, what is ?

    - the 60 million/year maintenance cost is almost as high as the
      "total 7-year cost" of 85 millions promised for the entire program.

       by 2015, the total tab will be 1 billion dollars.

    - the gripping testimony of John St-Amour (Marstar)

        - the brutality of the search for mere _papers_
           SWAT with the finger on the trigger of HK MP-5 weapoons
           and using the weapons to point where to go to
        - the systematic harrassment of the government pursuing a non-
              case demanding St-Amour plead guilty to some trivial charges
              as condition  to stop this 3-year long harrassment
        - over $100,000 in legal fees
        - the role of Canada Customs, describing St-Amour as "violent"
        - the government has unlimited funds (taxpayers' money) and can
          outspend anyone and drag anyone through court forever
        - trumped-up charges of "unsafe storage" to justify the fiasco.
        - this can happen to _anyone_.  C-68 allows searching for 
              records, unsafe storage charges are routinely fabricated


Spin doctoring from McLellan [minister of Justice]

    - talk of confiscation is paranoid
    - the registry will be cost-effective
    - used weeping mothers of Polytechnique killings as prop for C-68

Definition:  FASCISM: n.:  a political and economic movement, strongly nationalistic, magnifying the rights of the state as opposed to those of the individual, in which industry, though remaining largely under private ownership, and all administrative
political units, are controlled by a strong central government.
        -------------------------------------------------
"One of the ordinary modes by which tyrants accomplish their purpose, without resistance, is by disarming the people and making it an offense to keep arms".  - Joseph Story, U.S. Supreme Court Justice.
        -------------------------------------------------
the German gun control laws were enacted by the "liberal" Weimar Republic government that preceded Hitler, and were a strong aid to his coming to power -- because they disarmed Hitler's opponents, and Hitler's adherents ignored them -- as criminals have always ignored gun control laws.

Disarming the public is a frequent first step toward dictatorships and genocides.  Once the disarming is complete, the public is helpless against those who have the guns.        -------------------------------------------------
