> the following year became professor of physics at the University of Zurich.

Nothing here or anywhere else I can find about Einstein getting an honorary
anything other than a membership in the New York Plumbers Union after Albert
had made a comment about being a plumber after being asked what he would do
if he didn't do physics.
