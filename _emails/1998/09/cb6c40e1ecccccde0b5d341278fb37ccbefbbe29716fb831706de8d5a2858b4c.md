	Required as in purchasers large and small saying "You don't include
your source code, we won't buy it".

	Sort of like how restraunts are forced (usually) to provide
dinnerware, sure, they could MAKE you bring your own fork & plate, but they
wouldn't be too popular.

	"BETTER"?

	Remember "Undocumented Dos"?

	Wasn't there a (couple) windows versions?

	Microsoft sells/gives away it's API so that it can find competent
programmers to hire and lock away in tiny rooms.
