Doug, I'd just like to thank you for replying.  Even without looking at your
description, the fact that you are willing to talk to doubters and admit
the limitations of your technique make me a lot more comfortable believing
that you have something.  You don't fit into either of the two standard
types of snake-oil salesmen: The "I can't tell you because it's secret"
sort, and the "it's totally unbreakable, cures world hunger and
disposes of nuclear waste" sort.

Not that people still don't wonder, but I thought I'd temper the technical
grilling I see heating up with some appreciation for the fact that you've
already managed a better impression than 95% of the crypto wannabes
out there.
