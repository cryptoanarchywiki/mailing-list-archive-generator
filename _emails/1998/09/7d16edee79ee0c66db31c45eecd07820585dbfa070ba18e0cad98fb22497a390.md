IBM is proposing that anyone, or many people, will be free to
act as issuers of promises to pay in their proposed microcash
system.  Obviously their system is not very open, but unlike
previous amateurish proposals for microcash, it does support
a rich system of intermediaries transferring aggregated
promises to pay.

We really need an open system, which IBM is not, which goes
down to millicent values, which IBM does not, and which
supports intermediaries moving aggregated transactions, so
that customer and server to not have to be clients of the
same intermediary, which IBM does support, and previous
proposals for micropayment did not.
