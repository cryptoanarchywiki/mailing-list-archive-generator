Office Update Web Site
======================

The Office Update Web site was recently modified to make it easier for you
to find up-to-date information about Office Products. Office Update is a
free online extension of Microsoft Office that is accessible to all users.
You can access the site from the link placed prominently at the top of each
of the Office products by clicking Help, selecting Microsoft On The Web,
and then clicking Free Stuff. You can find the Office Update site at the
following address on the World Wide Web:

   http://officeupdate.microsoft.com/

The Office Update site provides the latest Office service releases,
security patches, product add-ins, new Office assistants, clip art,
templates, and custom business solutions.

Outlook Security Patch
======================

Now available is an updated security patch for Microsoft Outlook 98 that
protects you against a potential problem involving file attachments with
extremely long names as well as a variant found during continued testing.
The new location of this patch is on the Office Update site at:

   http://officeupdate.microsoft.com/updates/updOutlook.htm

Office 2000
===========

For information about features in the next version of Office, go to the
Microsoft Office 2000 site on the Internet:

   http://www.microsoft.com/office/2000/

Kernel32.dll Error During Office Setup
======================================

When installing Office 97 on Microsoft Windows 98, you may receive the
following error message:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to the
following:

   ACMSETUP caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL at
   0177:bff7be97.

This problem may occur when you have your CD-ROM drive configured to use
Direct Memory Access (DMA) in the Windows 98 Device Manager.

For information about this problem see Knowledge Base article Q190630.
This article is available on the Web at the following address:

   http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q190/6/30.asp

"No License" Error When Running Microsoft Access 97 on Windows 98
=================================================================

When you start Microsoft Access 97, you may receive the following error
message

   Microsoft Access can't start because there is no license for it on
   this machine.

even though you have a fully licensed copy of Microsoft Access. You may
receive this error message on a Windows 98 computer if the following
conditions are met:

 - You have installed Microsoft Publisher
 - You have installed Access from the Office 97 Professional CD

Certain fonts that are installed by Microsoft Publisher can result in the
incorrect registration of Microsoft Access 97, but only when Access is
being installed from the Office 97 Professional CD. You can correct the
registration error by using either of the following methods:

 - Rename one of the problem fonts, and then reinstall Microsoft Access
   from the Setup Maintenance Mode.

    -or-

 - Download a tool that Microsoft has on its Downloads Web site that
   corrects this problem.

Renaming the Font and Reinstalling Microsoft Access
---------------------------------------------------

Reinstalling Microsoft Access 97 using the Setup Maintenance Mode does not
require you to uninstall Microsoft Access first; it simply returns the
computer to the install state that it was in the last time Setup was run.
Follow these steps to correct the registry error:

 1. On the Start menu, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

 2. In the Named box, type "hatten.ttf" (without the quotation marks).

 3. In the Look In box, type "C:\Windows\Fonts" (without the quotation
    marks) or the path to the Fonts folder on your computer.

 4. Click the Find Now button to start the search.

 5. Under Name, right-click the hatten.ttf file, and click Rename on
    the menu that appears.

 6. Change the name of the file to "hatten.xxx" (without the quotation
    marks).

 7. Minimize (but do not close) the Find dialog box.

 8. On the Start Menu, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

 9. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

10. In the Add/Remove Program Properties dialog box, select the
    Install/Uninstall tab and select Microsoft Office 97, Professional
    Edition from the program list.

11. Click the Add/Remove button to run Office Setup in Maintenance
    Mode.

12. In the Microsoft Office 97 Setup dialog box, click Reinstall.

13. Once the reinstallation is finished, click the Find dialog box on
    the Windows taskbar to maximize it.

14. Under Name, right-click the hatten.xxx file, and click Rename on
    the menu that appears.

15. Change the name of the file to "hatten.ttf" (without the quotation
    marks).

Microsoft Access should now be properly registered.

Using the Downloadable Tool
