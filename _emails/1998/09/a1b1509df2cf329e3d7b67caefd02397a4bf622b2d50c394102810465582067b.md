Thanks to anonymous we offer the arrest warrant and
complaint against Carl Edward Johnson:

   http://jya.com/usa-v-cej-wc.htm  (23K)

List Cypherpunks is spotlighted by the IRS complainant,
Jeff Gordon, who made Jim Bell famous. The list is 
quoted, logged, tracked, and cited for its hosting alleged death 
threat messages against federal officials, which were
PGP-authenticated and -decoded, and their style and content 
assessed for identity of the author, along with other allegations 
by the RCMP on what Carl may or may not have done up north 
and by the Secret Service on Carl may or may not have said 
out west.

We have also been told that Carl is known as "The King
of Country Porn" among admiring fans of his music.

Whether this has anything to do with the little-known person 
we're seeking information about is a mystery.
