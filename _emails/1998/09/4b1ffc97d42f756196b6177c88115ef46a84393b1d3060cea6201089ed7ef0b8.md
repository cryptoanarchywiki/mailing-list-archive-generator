That's probably true for most of us...it was an unbelievable volume of crap
he sent the list. (as opposed to my crap ;-)

Yeah, much better, Tim. ;-)

But don't start holding rallies and saying it in public in NYC,
or Rudolph Giuliani might have you arrested.

Entirely unexplained is how one goes from passphrase "sog" (Shit on government?)
to decrypting the PGP message.

What public or private key was used?

Sparky got it wrong.

Many people could have the same public/secret key pairs, all they
have to do is give them out.

And you don't authenticate messages with the "secret key" in standard use.

This person seems to have no clue, after months of tracking, how
basic public key encryption software works.

In fact, the key ring could be edited to have a fake secret key
and the public key that works as the digital signature for the
posted message.

More questions: did they get the passphrase for his computer's
PGP secret key? How? And why did RCMP customs seize his computer?
