     Not all philosophies are religions.  Asserting so is an attempt
to make one or both of the terms meaningless.

     There are two forms of atheism (visit alt.atheism.moderated for
an unending discussion).  "Strong" atheists state that they "believe
that god does not exist."  "Weak" atheists state that they "do not
believe that god exists."  The first is a faith based positive
assertion, analogous to "god exists".  The second makes no assertion
and hence has no associated burden of proof.  Given the lack of
evidence for the existence of a god, it is the default, logical
position.

     Do you believe in leprechauns, because there is no proof that
they don't exist?  Do you believe in the Hindu pantheon?

     Without reason and logic, how do you propose to prove these
assertions?  Reason and logic don't "constrain", they provide a
framework for discovery.  This framework is unavailable to, and indeed
actively rejected by, believers in the supernatural.  Any meaningful
definition of the word "inquiry" presupposes the use of logic.

     All faith-based assertions are by definition irrational.  Mystics
frequently speak of transcendence as if the word denotes a concept
with a particular meaning, but never provide a coherent definition.
Perhaps you'll surprise me?
