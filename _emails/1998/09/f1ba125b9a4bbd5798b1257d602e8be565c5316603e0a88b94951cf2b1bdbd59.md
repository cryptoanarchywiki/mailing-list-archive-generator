In a message dated 98-09-15 23:06:12 EDT, you write:

I know... I noticed that just when I hit the send button.  Hmm, where you ever
an English teacher... maybe named Mrs. Braly?

Anyway... I don't type like an idiot, as I HAVE seen.

I also rarely ever reply to someone, so I forget all about the quotes when I
do, I am sorry for that mistake.  Hopefully it is corrected to everyone on the
internet's liking above.

I think (but not sure) that you are trying to put words in my mouth with the
following statement: 

> but since AOL _is_ the Internet

Well, I never said anything like that.  Actually, I only like a few things
about AOL, but I know it is NOT _the_ Internet.  I also know that NO ISP is
_the_ Internet.  It is a collection of protocols, etc.  Next time, don't put
words in my mouth.  

Someone once said (I can't remember who exactly),
The greatest threat to manipulators are the people who think for themselves.
So, I really don't CARE what you say about me, or too me.  It really has no
meaning to me.  

Oh, and maybe it will give you some wierd joy to know that I _am_ switching
ISP's soon, to dfw.net, with SunOS shell account =)

Well, enough of replying to your insults, or what I took to be insults.  I
need to read a little.

Bye.
-The person that has been labeled a typical AOL k00l d00d

P.S.  Grow up... quit berating people because of an ISP that they MAY not even
have had a choice on... did you ever think of that?
