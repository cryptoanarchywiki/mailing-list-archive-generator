twit, v.t, twitted, twitting. address teasingly.

I'm touched! You think I'm teasing you? Well, I'm NOT teasing you. 
You're an ASSHOLE! Yes I spelled it correctly so there wouldn't be 
any misunderstanding. You're a self-righteous prick who dumps on 
people just because they have a certain email address without any 
consideration for what they may be saying. Yes there are clueless 
people at AOL and there are clueless people at got.net and at 
intnet.net. So what?

When you cut yourself off from people just because of their email 
address you do yourself a disservice but when you try to dissuade 
others because of your prejudice then you wrong us as well. I am 
quite able to evaluate the worthiness of someones words without your 
superior pronouncements.

If you don't have anything of value to add to the discussion then 
shut-the-fuck-up!

Edwin
