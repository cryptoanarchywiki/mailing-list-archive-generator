I can think of several versions of this:

a. simple money and politics - company wants big $ deal, contributes to
right politicians. ( |$| > |USA| ) --> fast track for deal

b. round 2 of crypto-AG - they want to listen to the Chinese so they had
better be the equipment vendor. Who operates the satellites that the
Chinese radios use?

You might say that to meet US Intelligence needs the range of products
available outside the US should be minimized and those that are shipped
should come from companies that cooperate with the NSA. It makes some
*small* amount of sense but certainly plays hell with what an
entrepreneurial type might want to accomplish. Pretty unfair in that
regard. Especially since they have no visible control over
extraterritorial ventures anyway. Civilian interest and capability in
crypto must piss these guys off beyond belief. Stupid Constitution!
