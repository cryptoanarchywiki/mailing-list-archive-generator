"Keep thought: If the Internet were a dog, it might be named Toto. Like
that little yapper in the famous film whose bark had some bite, the
Internet is yanking back the curtains and exposing the powers that be
for what they are: big-mouthed, fast-talking "wizards" about to be run
out of town."

(from http://www.business2.com/articles/issue1.html)


For some reason when I read this paragraph, it had an oddly strange
parallel meaning. ;)
