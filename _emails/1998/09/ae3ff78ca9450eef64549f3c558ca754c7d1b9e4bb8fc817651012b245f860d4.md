Some do, some don't. A lot of new machines resolve those issues in the BIOS
with a setting that allows you to choose between a couple of options at

Maybe, the fact that you've added an extra block of code in there to check
for the additional keystroke would cause the cycle length of that section of
ML to be slightly longer, probably no more than 30 - 40 clock cycles. If
you're looking at the EM radiation that lengthening could show up.
