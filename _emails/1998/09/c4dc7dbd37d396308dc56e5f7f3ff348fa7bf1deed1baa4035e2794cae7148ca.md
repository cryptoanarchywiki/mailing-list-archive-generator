The first assertion is not entirely accurate- I played with Magic Folders
for a while- it relies on a command, usu. in the autoexec.bat or win.ini
file (dos/windows environment) to load, with a bootable floppy disk these
commands would would be bypassed and the so-called "hidden" folder is in
plain sight.
