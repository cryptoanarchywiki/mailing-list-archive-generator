Please elaborate. Netscape works fine on Windows 98, and faces the
same restrictions with installation that original Windows 95 had. 

As for Java, Java works as well on Windows as on any other platform. 

It's funny how giving the customers more value for their money, always
ends up being anti-competative. It's a thorny issue that's not easy to
deal with. Especially with Microsoft. They have such a large pool of
source code, so many employees, and such an effective distribution
network, that they can quickly add a jillion features to any program,
and make so much money off of it, that it's difficult for anyone but a
multi-million dollar company to compete

And no, taking the browser out of Windows is not going to change that.
