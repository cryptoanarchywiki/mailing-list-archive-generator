As i'am one of persons mention in Toto's posts I would just like to 
say I think the posts were a joke.
With the help of of Vullis I was a pain to the list and this was Toto's 
way of acknowledging this
To the government readers of this list,the cigar was Cuban,will you 
put Bill in the cell with Toto.
