I thought this was already known or I would have said:

"Mark Twain Bank (MTB), a small bank headquartered in the Midwest, took a
bold step
three years ago when it became the first bank in the world to offer
privacy-protecting eCash
accounts.  In April, 1997, however, MTB was bought out by Mercantile Bank,
and the larger,
stodgier bank recently decided to drop the eCash program."

They probably weren't making any money.  I wonder if Mercantile will drop
MTB's foreign currency accounts as well?
