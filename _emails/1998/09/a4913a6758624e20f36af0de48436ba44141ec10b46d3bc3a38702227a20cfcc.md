A source inside Dick Armey's office today said that it is probable
that there will be a national ID repeal provision in the Omnibus
appropriations bill this year. We need to continue to "remind" the
House leadership (Gingrich, Armey, DeLay) that this is a non-negotiable
issue over the next week. Armey and DeLay are friends of ours on this
issue, but Gingrich will do only what the political winds tell him.

[Good link to contact your congress-critters:]
http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/
=======================================================================
Call your Congress person every day toll-free!

[Haven't checked these numbers to see if they are still good.]

You may phone the U. S. Capitol switchboard at any of the following
numbers, when they answer, ask for your Senator or Representative's office.
If you don't know the name of your Senator or Representative, tell the
operator where you live and she will connect you to the proper office. 
(800)972-3524
(800)522-6721
(888)723-5246

=======================================================================
[Here's another number:]

The Unions have set up a toll-free number so individuals can call
Congress. If you have to call a congressional office, use the following
number: 1-888-723-5246. Each phone call may cost the unions between
$4.00-$10.00. Use it if you're on the hill or off the hill. Give the
number to 15 of your closest friends and have them call their
congressman's office just to say "hi". Calling this number puts you
directly through to the congressional operator.

[Haven't checked it either.]

=======================================================================
Don't believe anything you read on the Net unless:
1) you can confirm it with another source, and/or
2) it is consistent with what you already know to be true.
