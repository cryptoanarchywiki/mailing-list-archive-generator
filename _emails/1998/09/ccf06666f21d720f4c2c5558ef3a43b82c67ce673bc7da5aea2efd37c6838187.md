Sorry Tim, you need to re-check your history.

No one was kicked off their land until *after* war broke out in '45. All
land occupied by the Jews before that was *purchased* from the Arabs
living there. There was also a large percentage of land that was either
desert or swaps that was reclaimed by the Jews and turned into productive
farm land. Tel Aviv was nothing but sand and scrub brush before the Jews
started building there (there was the Ancient city of Jaffo which Tel Aviv
has now encompassed but it took decades of expansion before Tel Aviv
reached that far south).

After the various battles of this 50 year war large percentages of the
Palestinian population left Israelie held territory, but this had more to
do with the Arab leaders calling for them to do so (and their not wanting
to live under Israelie rule) than it did with the Jews pushing them out.

Similar migrations were seen when India and Pakistan were created. Large
portions of Moslem population that were living in India moved to Pakistan
despite Ghandi's calls for them to stay.
