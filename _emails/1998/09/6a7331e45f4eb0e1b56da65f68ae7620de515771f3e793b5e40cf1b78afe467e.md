Of course, 32-bit AOL allows you to use all the TCP/IP protocols...

Do you follow these hobbies simultaneously, or do you do 'Internet-ing' 
as
a separate activity to paintballing your upgrades?
Isn't 'Internet-ing' similar to 'road-ing' or 'railway-ing'?

Fine. Obvious. Not all arabs mug me in the streets of Jerusalem. Enough

much we hate AOL-ers and demonstrate some reason for being on this
list in the first place, other than 'Internet-ing'.
