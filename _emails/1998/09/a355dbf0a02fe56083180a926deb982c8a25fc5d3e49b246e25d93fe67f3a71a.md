Think twice before citing this new law....

Whatever one thinks about unsolicited e-mail, the provisions of this new
California bill are frightening to any supporter of liberty.

* the requirement that mail have a "real" name attached to it runs afoul of
the right to anonymous messages, supported in various cases (Talley, for
example). A requirement that e-mail be identified is no different from a
requirement that pamphlets and articles have "real" names on them. So much
for the First Amendment.

(Oh, and the _commercial_ nature of UCE has nothing to do with the First
Amendment issues, unless one thinks the canonical First case, Sullivan, is
meaningless because the New York Times was "commercial speech.")

* think of the implications for anonymous messages, through remailers

* and where does the "must have a toll-free number" bullshit come from?
Think about it. It may sound _nice_ to demand that people have toll-free
numbers, but where is the constitutional support for such a taking?

And so on.
