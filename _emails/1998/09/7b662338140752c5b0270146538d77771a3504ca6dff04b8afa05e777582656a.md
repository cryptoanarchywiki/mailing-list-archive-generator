Dear Dumbshit,

Thank you for spamming the Cypherpunks list with an ad for your crippleware
and your lame, pathetically designed web site.

Your official 30-day activation key is: ISUCKANDCANTWRITEHTMLANDISPAM

You'll need to enter this key when you try to activate your brain.

Included in response to all spams to the Cypherpunks list are free tests
which will be run on your system. Any security holes we find will not be
reported, but exploited.

NOTE: If you are using FuckIt Spammer 1.0.x to spam your ad, please make
sure you walk off a high-rise ledge and fall several hundred feet or we may
have to make sure you do it, and you probably don't want that.

If you have questions about your computer security, you do not need to send
to Cypherpunks. You have already requested that your machine be checked for
all security holes and that any found will be exploited to make you look
even stupider than you make yourselves look. We also suggest you learn how 
to make a web site. Please visit http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/. If you
don't find your answers there, please walk in front of an 18-wheeler going
70mph, or call 911 and phone in a bomb threat.

When you are ready to put yourself out of our misery, please slash your 
wrists and play vampire. It's simple so your simple minds should be able to
handle it, but it is a little messy.

Sincerely,

The Cypherpunks
