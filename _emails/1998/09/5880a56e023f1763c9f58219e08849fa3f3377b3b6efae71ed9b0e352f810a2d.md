So you're proposal is not only to put the crypto in the BIOS but a set of
hardware device drivers to drive this port during boot but won't interfere
with regular OS device drivers?

That was an additional issue that I was going to bring up.

I suspect that in both cases it would be feasible to do, though you'd need
to use a special driver in Linux type OS'es to shadow the BIOS driver back
into the memory map.

The real issue with me about this whole scheme is the distribution
mechanism. It is just too shakey and porous not to allow LEA's to know about
it. If they can get a copy themselves then they have a perfect mechanism to
build a virus-scanner style of program to look for the appropriate
footprint.
