Okay. Cool. Sorry if I mischaracterized it somehow, I wasn't trying to.

Or was it Diffie who said something like that?

By the way, someone told me that the Crypto "Authors@MIT" talk with you and
Diffie, etc., was on CSPAN recently, so if someone *really* wanted to, they
could go back, see *exactly* what was said, and say here what the idea was,
(and who to attribute it to, of course), that prompted me to make the, um,
offending, comment, they could do so.

Frankly, I was too hyped from telling the FBI guy he didn't matter anymore,
not to mention his dirty look that followed :-), to remember it accurately
enough for scientific attribution.

Sorry if I mischaracterized what was surely the right thing to say at the
time... :-).

Cheers,
