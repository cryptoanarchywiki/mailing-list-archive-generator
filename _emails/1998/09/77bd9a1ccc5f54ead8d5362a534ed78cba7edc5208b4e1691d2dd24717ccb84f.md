I stay off of these proliferating lists. The Cypherpunks list was the first
one, and despite its many flaws over the years, it's enough for me.

I'm not on the Lewispunks list, nor the Perrypunks list, nor any of the
many Hettingapunks lists. And when the Cypherpunks list briefly became the
Sandypunks list, I left for a while.

Works for me. Cypherpunks...the Real Thing (TM).

BTW, I dislike getting all these crossposts from Lewispunks, Perrypunks,
and Hettingapunks, all the more so when attempting to _reply_ to these
messages often generates "You have no permission to post to this list"
responses, or the like. Makes me want to get some of Vulis' tools and apply
them appropriately.
