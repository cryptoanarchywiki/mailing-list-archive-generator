Sounds like a great idea, in the "Asking for truth from power" category.
I doubt you'll get a lot of responses, but good luck.

Of course, if the Member answers "No", then the obvious followon is
	"So what are you trying to hide?"  :-)
but that's really best left for the version of the survey for
appointed officials asking if they think appointed officials 
should be investigated.
