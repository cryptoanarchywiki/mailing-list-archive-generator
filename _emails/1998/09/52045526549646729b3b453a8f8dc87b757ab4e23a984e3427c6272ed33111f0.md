Well Fred you and pjm can believe what you wish, I fully support it.

However, yourself, pjm, & Mr. Smith are claiming that a belief that
something doesn't exist isn't a belief is simply a tricky play on semantics.
A belief in a negative is still a belief irrespective of how many people
believe it. Might doesn't make right (or logical).

As I've demonstrated before (and for the last time):

^(A) = (^A)

Argue all you want,

Yet it moves.
