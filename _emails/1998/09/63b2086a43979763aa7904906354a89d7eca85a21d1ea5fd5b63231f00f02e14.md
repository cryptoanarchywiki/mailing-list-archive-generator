If you mean "Why does Bill P rant like that", not my problem.

But if you mean "Is the Fatwa against Salman Rushdie over?",
the news has been that the Iranian government has decided
to drop their ~$2M reward for killing him.  That doesn't mean
all of the mullahs have stopped calling for Muslims to
kill him for blasphemy.  But at least the government has
decided good relationships with the Brits are more important
than keeping their more fanatical fanatics happy.
Rushdie was quoted in the press as being very relieved.

If there's cypherpunks relevance to this, it's that cryptographic
privacy and digital cash payments make it easier to publish
controversial material without the threat of violence against you.
