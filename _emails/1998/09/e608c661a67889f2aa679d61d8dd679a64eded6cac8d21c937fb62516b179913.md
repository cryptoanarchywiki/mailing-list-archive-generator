Intended by who? As far as I know there are no legal limitations on applying
for and receiving a domain from anywhere through the suitable authority.
There is most certainly zero law that regulates where the owners of those
domains may reside or operate.

Snark hunt.

I got nothing against nailing spammers, but simply being a sex related site
isn't a crime.

Irrelevant unless you own the right to administre the tonga domain.

Do you?

I vote *NO*.
