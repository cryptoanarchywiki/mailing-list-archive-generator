Solve Computer Problems With DNA

By TERESA RIORDAN

Four years ago, Dr. Leonard Adleman raised the exciting possibility of
DNA-powered supercomputers when he wrote in the journal Science that he had
solved a computational problem essentially by stirring up some DNA in a
test tube, using building blocks of DNA as computing symbols. 

The technique, in concept, involves the use of DNA -- strands of genetic
code -- as a stand-in for computer software code. 

Adleman, a professor at the University of Southern California, set up his
problem by synthesizing DNA in a certain sequence and then letting DNA
molecules react in a test tube so they ultimately produce a molecule
whose sequence is the answer to the problem. 

He used the chemical units of DNA rather than electronic 1s and 0s to solve
a single, relatively simple problem: figuring out the shortest distance
someone would have to travel to visit a number of different cities --
similar to a standard math problem referred to as the "traveling salesman
tour problem." 

But last week Dr. Warren Smith and Dr. Allan Schweitzer, two scientists at
the NEC Research Institute in Princeton, N.J., received what appears to be
the first patent covering a DNA computing process that at least
theoretically can solve not just a single problem but a broad array of
problems, just as a conventional desktop computer might. 

The patent describes a way to concoct a vat of DNA molecules that have been
manipulated by standard biotechnology techniques -- such as the cutting,
splicing and growing of DNA strands -- to behave like
miniature computers.  

All these molecular-size computers would operate in parallel, with each one
exploring different possible computational paths to solve a problem,
potentially speeding up computing time greatly. 

The patent details a way to use genetic material to construct a large
number of what are called Turing machines, all running in parallel, with
each exploring different possible computational paths. (A Turing machine is
a theoretical construct, first proposed in 1937 by the British computer
scientist Alan Turing, that provides the schematic outline upon which
digital computers are based.) 

Despite the new patent, Smith does not sound optimistic these days about
the patented technique. 

"Some of the DNA molecules do the right step," he said in an interview,
describing the process. "But then some other fraction just dissolve and get
flushed down the drain." 

This and other problems lead to an exponential buildup in errors during the
calculations. In addition, the operations of this DNA computing so far are
slow-going, taking hours. 

"This does appear to be the first patent to issue in this area," said David
Waltz, an NEC vice president. "But will this be the basis of a new
industry, and will everyone have to take out a license on it in the future?
That's not so clear." 

Smith and Schweitzer received patent number 5,804,373. 

Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark
Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.
