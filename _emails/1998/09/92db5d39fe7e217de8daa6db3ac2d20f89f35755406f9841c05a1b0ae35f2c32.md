Both the Palestinians and the Jews living in Trans-Jordan wanted their own
country. The UN resolution divided up the land based on population and
gave each group their own country. Israel declared their independence, the
Palestinians listened to the Grand Mufti and join in the holy war to wipe
out the Jews. The Arabs lost, too bad, game over.

And interesting note to the whole palestinian "issue" is that the majority
of the population of Jordan is palestinian!! And long before the Intifada
the PLO tried to take over the government of Jordan and were embroiled in
civil war for most of the 60's and early 70's. The Jordanian Arabs finally
kick the PLO out in the early 70's (71 maybe 72).

This re-wright of history might give you warm fuzzies but no one was moved
at gun point off their land (at least not until the Arabs started the
war). The Jews that emigrated to Trans-Jordan/Palestine *purchased* the
land from the Arabs that were living there. Even after the war the
majority of palestinians left on their own.

None of the current Arab countries existed until the British carved up
their conquered territory after WWI. If Israel is not "legitimate" because
of UK/UN involvement does it follow that all of the Arab states that were
formed at this time are also illegitimate? Perhaps we should should
re-unite the Ottoman Empire? How far back in history do you want to go to
find the "legitimate" territorial boundaries? Persian? Roman? Israel?
Egyptian? Sumerian?

I find it quite hypocritical of Americans who see the Israelites as
occupiers and oppressors but would be outraged at calls to give back the
south-west to Mexico. Tim, you want to give your ranch to some Mexican
family since the Americans took that land from them? but then the mexicans
would have to give that land back to some deserving "native" Americans as
they took that land from them. But then again we would have to sift
through the thousands of years of tribal warfare and migration to find the
one true owners of the land.
