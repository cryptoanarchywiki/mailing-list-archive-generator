This guy keeps using 'group' instead of 'mailing list', there is the
potential implication of conspiracy here...I wouldn't be surprised if just
about all of us weren't under surveillance at this point.

See I told you there was a conspiracy buried in there somewhere!

Probably not a wise move, don't know about psychological problems but it
certainly demonstrates a lack of intelligence.

That's impressive if true.
