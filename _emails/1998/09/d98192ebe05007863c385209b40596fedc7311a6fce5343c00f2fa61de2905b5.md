A friend of mine asked me to forward this question to you guys:

IMHO he needs a good lawyer, but maybe someone here knows more:

They are preventing me from renewing my license due to a clerical error they 
made over a year ago. Since I did not respond to their letter (I didn't 
understand what they were talking about) they suspended my license. That 
caused my insurance company to drop me. When I renewed my insurance (a 
second error, if you have a suspension you can not get insurance) they told 
me it was cleared.

I need to talk to someone who can help me resolve this without me having to 
hand in my license and plate for the 90 day penalty
