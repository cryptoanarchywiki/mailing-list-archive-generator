FCC regulations prohibit amateur radio services from carrying either
encrypted OR commercial traffic.  Either of these restrictions makes
amateur radio networks useless for CP purposes.  And hams are very
diligent at self-enforcement, often devoting hundreds of man-hours to
track down a single unlicenced operator.

Anyone who wishes to establish a network that may -- at any point in
its life -- have to operate outside the "law" (whatever THAT happens
to be at the time) will be well advised to steer clear of the amateur
radio community.
