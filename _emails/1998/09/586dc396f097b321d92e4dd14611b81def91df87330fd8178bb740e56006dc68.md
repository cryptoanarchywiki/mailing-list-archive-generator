Why wait?  None of the AES candidates is currently exportable without a
license, and the much weaker DES algorithm that one of them will replace
is not exportable without a license.  In fact, according to the instructions
posted at NIST the algorithm designers from outside the US and Canada were
required to fill out export license applications in order to get a copy of
their own algorithms back from NIST.

Without a change in the regulations AES will be no more exportable
than DES is now.
