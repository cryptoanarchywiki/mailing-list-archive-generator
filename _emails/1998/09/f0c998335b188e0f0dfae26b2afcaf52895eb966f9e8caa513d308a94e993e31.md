	If you do (1), and simply have _no_ prompt, just a small space in
time AFTER the POST (say, immediately after) to type in your passkey, and
things are
set up that if you type the wrong keys, it goes straight into hidden space
mode, then there would be no suspicion, other than a slightly long boot
sequence (and if the wait time were only 2 or 3 seconds, it might not even
be noticable.)
