I was just browsing replay and I ran into a server on it called an
eternity server, That one wont let me use it because of permissions. 
I was wondering if there was another one around that has been tested
recently.

Also I was curious as to whether there were any crypto conscous ISP
that let you have a page with SSL cheap if it was just an ifo page and
not a commercial site.  Any help would be Appreciated.
