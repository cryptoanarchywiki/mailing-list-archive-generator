Pardon me if I'm a bit slow here but isn't this just a less
space-efficient form of key escrow? Shouldn't you keep the pad secret
and then trash it after use? 

And if a pad is distributed using a traditional encryption system isn't
the security of the "OTP" then the same as the method used to send it? 
Don't you need secret agents handcuffed to briefcases to distribute real
OTPs?
