Not quite true.  traceroute does use DNS.  If you do traceroute www.joe.com
it will use dns to resolve it to an ip.  If you do traceroute 10.0.0.1, it
will use dns to resolve it to a name.   At every hop, it will use reverse
DNS to resolve the ip's to names.  If a hop doesn't have a reverse, you see
it's ip.

Traceroute under unix uses UDP on some high random port.  Traceroute on NT
(TRACERT.EXE) uses ICMP.  In both cases, it sets the TTL field to 1, and sends
a message.  The router dropping the message responds with ICMP telling your
host, "packet dropped due to ttl" -- this returns that router's ip address to
you.   (For non TCP heads - each packet has a TTL - time to live field that
gets decreased as the packet "hops" across a router.  When the TTL reaches
zero, the next router to receive it drops it and returns an error to the
sender.  This mechanism is used to prevent router loops from brining down all
the networks in the loop among other things like tracing a route...)

One can hide routers by making them ignore ICMP or not respond to ICMP.  In
such cases, you simply get time outs (a line with 3 *'s)...

A good test is to use traceroute from NT/95 and another from unix so you can
tell what's filtered.
