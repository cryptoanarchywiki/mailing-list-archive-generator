By default. The machine boots. It is either told to accept a passphrase or
is told nothing. If the latter, it boots normally, only with its HD-hiding
code. If the former, it prompts, accepts a passphrase, and then boots
normally, only with the HD-hiding code disabled.

What I think you're asking is how the actual cryptography would be done. I
wouldn't want to stick crypto code in the BIOS, or at least not the code
which will be used all the time. 

I think a better way to do this is to have the BIOS boot up in HD-hiding
mode all the time, and require user-mode software to disable HD-hiding
mode and then deal with the cryptography.

You don't, at least not at first. If you hold down maybe the left and
right shift keys, in combination with the left alt key while pressing the
"R" key, it prompts "BIOS: ". You type your passphrase in. LILO (the LInux
LOader) does this if you depress a shift key during boot. Obviously with
LILO it's to specify kernel parameters, what OS to boot into, and things
like that.
