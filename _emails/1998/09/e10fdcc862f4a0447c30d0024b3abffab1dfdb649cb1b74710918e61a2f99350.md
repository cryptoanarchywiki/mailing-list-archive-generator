There will be a cypherpunks meeting and party this Saturday, September 19
starting at 5 pm in Adams Morgan, Washington, DC.

Our two out-of-town guests are Doug McGowan from HP (who will speak about
his company's encryption products that became controversial early this
year) and David Burt of filteringfacts.org (who's here for a Christian
Coalition conference and may or may not feel like speaking about his
position on some of the anti-porn legislation likely to pass Congress).

Interested in coming? RSVP and I'll send directions.

-Declan
