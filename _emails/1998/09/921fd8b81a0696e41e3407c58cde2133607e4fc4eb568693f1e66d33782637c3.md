I know someone who is good friends with this guy. My friend is a
commodities broker who is active in gun shows and in weapons dealing. The
guy mentioned above has a couple of working tanks at this ranch up in
Portola Valley, tanks which he drives around. And lots of other weapons. I
was supposed to go on a shoot with this bunch a while back, but I couldn't
make it.

His Scud missile is unlikely to have been planned for any real use. Maybe
they think that with the First Criminal's spawn enrolled in the school down
Alpine Road that he's some kind of threat.

I could say more, but then I'd have to kill everyone who reads the list.
