CHP introduces cellular-friendly 911 system

Operators will now be able to capture the
telephone number and location of the caller
within a half-block area
 
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 17 - The California Highway Patrol
this week demonstrated a new countywide 911 system designed
to provide operators with the telephone numbers and
location of callers using mobile telephones.

Los Angeles County is the first in the state to use
the new technology, said CHP Sgt. Ernie Sanchez.
All local 911 calls for the CHP, whether via mobile
phones or "land lines," are routed to the CHP
half-a-millionCommunications Center just west of downtown, 
but mobile phone calls could not be traced until recently, 
Sanchez said.

"It doesn't matter if you live in Pasadena or Arcadia
or West Covina; if you call on a cell phone, that call will
go through the CHP Communications Center" and operators
will be able to capture the telephone number and location
of the caller within a half-block area, Sanchez said.

The enhanced technology has been in use for the past
three weeks, he said.

All major mobile phone companies are participating in
the test and demonstration of the system, Sanchez said,
adding that the technology should be in place nationwide by
2001 under Federal Communications Commission rules.
