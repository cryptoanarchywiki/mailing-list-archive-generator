In fact some authorities thought that you could give an "exculpatory no"
answer to questions without being guilty of Obstruction of Justice.  "Did
you accept a bribe from the Chinese, Mr. Clinton." "No."  But last year the
Supremes held that even "exculpatory noes" can be Obstruction so the better
answer (as it always has been) is "Get out of my face G-Man I don't have to
talk to scum like you."  (Or words to that effect).
