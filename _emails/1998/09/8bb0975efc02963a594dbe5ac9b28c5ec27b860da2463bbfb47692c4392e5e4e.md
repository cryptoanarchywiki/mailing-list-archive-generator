There are two distinct licenses promoted by the FSF.  They are the GNU
GPL (General Public License) and the GNU LGPL (Library General Public
License).

As you suggest the LGPL is usuable.

However Werner Koch's GNUPG (OpenPGP implementation) uses GPL (not
LGPL) -- or at least it did in version 10-0.0.0, which is the source
tree I have here.

So the comment was on Werner's license, and use of GPL in general for
crypto code, which started this discussion when he offered that it
contained a GPLed Twofish implementation, when Bruce Schneier asked if
anyone had Public Domain implementations in various languages.  (Not
matching Bruce's PD requirement, note).

I did make this distinction in my 2nd post on this topic:

: (There is a difference between GNU and GNU Library.  GNU library allows
: you to use a library without infecting your entire software.  GNU
: library is sort of usable.)

Yes.  My point is to highlight for those writing crypto code with the
aim of crypto deployment NOT to use GPL, but preferably (in my view)
PD, BSD, or lastly LGPL.

I went on to suggest half-seriously a "cypherpunk license" which
restricted use of the code to code without government back doors.
