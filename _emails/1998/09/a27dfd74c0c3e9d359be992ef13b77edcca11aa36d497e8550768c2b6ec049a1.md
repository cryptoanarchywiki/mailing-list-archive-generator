>    FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Whitewater witness James McDougal did not
>    have access to his heart medication in the hours before he died in
>    prison, a federal government report revealed.
>    
>    McDougal, a former business partner of President Clinton who later
>    agreed to testify for Independent Counsel Ken Starr, also was not seen
>    by a doctor although he complained of feeling ill the day before his
>    death, according to a report obtained by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram
>    under the Freedom of Information Act.
>    
>    McDougal was moved from his regular cell to solitary confinement at
>    the Federal Medical Center prison in Fort Worth a day before his death
>    as punishment for failing to provide a urine sample for a drug test.
>    
>    McDougal had complained of being unable to provide urine for drug
>    tests because of the medications he took for a variety of ailments.
>    
>    During the move, guards did not find McDougal's heart medication
>    because they did not want to search McDougal's regular cell and
>    disturb his sleeping cell mate, the report said.
>    
>    One of the medicines, nitroglycerin, could have bought McDougal some
>    time after he suffered a heart attack, a prison official who asked not
>    to be identified said in the Sunday paper.
