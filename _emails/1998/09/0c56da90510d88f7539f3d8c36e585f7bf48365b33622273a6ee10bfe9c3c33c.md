>    After two years he obtained a post at the Swiss patent office in Bern.
>    The patent-office work required Einstein's careful attention, but
>    while employed (1902-09) there, he completed an astonishing range of
>    publications in theoretical physics. For the most part these texts
>    were written in his spare time and without the benefit of close
>    contact with either the scientific literature or theoretician
>    colleagues. Einstein submitted one of his scientific papers to the
>    University of Zurich to obtain a Ph.D. degree in 1905. In 1908 he sent
>    a second paper to the University of Bern and became a lecturer there.
>    The next year Einstein received a regular appointment as associate
>    professor of physics at the University of Zurich.
