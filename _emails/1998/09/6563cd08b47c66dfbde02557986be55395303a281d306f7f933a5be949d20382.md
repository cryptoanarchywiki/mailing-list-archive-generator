	At one time I had some involvement with a company renting
satellite space, and the figure of around $1500 to $3000 a month for a
voice channel capable of being used on small VSAT sized dishes was
passed around.  It depends on how much bandwidth and power the channel
uses which in turn depends on how big the dishes are (G/T to be exact).
Bigger dishes mean weaker signals on the satellite and lower charges. I
could probably find out the formula used to price the service...

	I suspect that the cost of equipment and licensing and regulatory
compliance of various sorts might make it unpleasant for loosely knit
groups of private citizens - uplinks require competant installation
and maintainence to keep them from causing interference to other users
and various other problems such as RF radiation hazards under control.

	On the other hand, satellites are crawling with little signals
transmitting streams of data or voice or music to groups of receivers
scattered over wide geographic areas, so the econmics aren't prohibitive
for people who have some real need...
