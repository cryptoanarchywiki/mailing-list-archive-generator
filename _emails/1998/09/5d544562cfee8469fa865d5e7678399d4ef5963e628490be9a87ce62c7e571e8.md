#   Bin Laden has suffered other setbacks recently. On Wednesday night, the
#   FBI arrested Wadih el Hage, an Arlington, Texas man who law enforcement
#   officials charge worked with bin Laden and Al-Din in Sudan, and with
#   Fazil in Kenya from 1994 to 1997. He has been charged with lying to the
#   FBI about his relationship with other bin Laden operatives, including a
#   senior bin Laden lieutenant who drowned in a 1996 ferryboat accident in
#   Tanzania.

Is "lying to the FBI" a law on the books, or is the actual
charge something else?
