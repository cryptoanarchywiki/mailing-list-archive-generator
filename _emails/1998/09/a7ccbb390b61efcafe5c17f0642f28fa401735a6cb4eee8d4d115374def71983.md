I can't give you a URL to my satellite article in this week's Time
magazine; it won't be on our web site for another week.

  The Super-Cell
  By Declan McCullagh

  The Iridium consortium and rival joint ventures are closing in on their
  goal of making sat phones into multibillion-dollar mainstays of the
  info-superhighway

Also worth checking out is an article by Tamala Edwards on the Vermont
Senate race, in which an honest-to-goodness 79-year old dairy farmer is
running against incumbent Dem Patrick Leahy. You'll remember Leahy is the
architect of the Digital Telephony wiretapping law, but was also a vocal
opponent of the CDA.
