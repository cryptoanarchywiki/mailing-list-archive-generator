Better yet, give anyone on the mailing list a veto over their new
membership. Send a cookie to the address that was signed up, and an
anti-cookie. If anyone returns the anti-cookie, in effect saying "we don't
want to be part of your blasted service," put them on a list of
do-not-contact people for half a year or so.

That will minimise disruptions. It will also minimise disruptions to your
service when pissed-off vigilantes decide to take matters into their own
hands.
