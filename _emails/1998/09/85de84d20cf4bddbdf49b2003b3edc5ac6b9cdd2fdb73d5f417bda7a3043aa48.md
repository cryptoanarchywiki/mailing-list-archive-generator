Yeah, if you quote back over a hundred lines after adding 6, 8, or
whatever it happened to be.

And where did he not? A few could be debated. The rest were either written
so badly that they were incomprehensible, were off-topic, or didn't
include quoted material in a reply/followup. He also stated that he was
counting postings which used that '<< >>' scheme as automatically bad,
which is understandable. Either way, he seemed to be trying to show the
statistics. Pull one or two postings off of one side and put them on the
other and the statistics are still pretty bad for AOL.

No, I want a Cypherpunks list which discusses political issues,
cryptography, and things related to that. Since this is the Cypherpunks
list, we aren't going to censor on the basis of content or origin point.

If all you want to do is defend AOL and their ilk, may I recommend
comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy and alt.aol-sucks.

Muff diving pics? Do we want to know? Serious questions.
