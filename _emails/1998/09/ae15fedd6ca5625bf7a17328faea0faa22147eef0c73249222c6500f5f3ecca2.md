No. Actually, we're convinced that you're just a lamer. Usually spamming
and mailbombing goes along with that.

You need 100 accounts on the same ISP for that? Your implied claims of
being Internet savvy are pretty suspect considering that you haven't even
figured out how to quote yet. Besides, all having 100 accounts usually
means is that you installed a password sniffer on a university LAN or you
ran crack on a passwd file.
