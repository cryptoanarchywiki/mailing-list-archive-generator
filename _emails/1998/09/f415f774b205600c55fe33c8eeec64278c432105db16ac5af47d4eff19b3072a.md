I'm sending this for Jim (ravage@ssz.com) as he is a bit too busy just
now.

He just arrived at home to find the dog pinned under the tree that fell
and took out the phones and the ISDN.

The dog is apparently uninjured (though only two feet from certain
death).  Don't know which dog.

The ISDN is hurt and probably won't be up till sometime tomorrow.
 

                               Later,
                                  Wayne
