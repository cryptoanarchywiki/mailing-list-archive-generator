 I would suppose the T-hunt aspects of a clandestine network would be 
obviated by piggybacking it into a commercial satellite transponder 
channels ... which brings to mind about how expensive one or two of those 
channeles might be. I remeber in the early days of ham packet radio we 
had several 'wormholes' where hams had obtained through their places of 
employemnt temporary use of unused satellite channels where we were given 
essentially RS232 access and we adapted the packet switches to an async 
backchannel in place of another synch RF path. They did make for some 
intersting network improvements. I guess it always comes down to how do 
you fund such things.
