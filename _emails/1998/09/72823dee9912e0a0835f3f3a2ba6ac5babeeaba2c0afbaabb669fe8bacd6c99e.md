	Ok, I'm rewriting history, you say IN THE SAME POST:

The UN resolution divided up the land based on population and gave each
group their own country.

	--and--

The Jews that emigrated to Trans-Jordan/Palestine *purchased* the land from
the Arabs that were living there.

	So tell me, is there a difference between being _told_ you will
sell your house and move, and deciding you really would prefer to live
elsewhere? Oh, and when this artifical coutry was set up, did EVERYONE have
equal say in the government, or were certain Northern Europeans of jewish
faith considered more equal. Of course, being given the short end of the
political and economic stick couldn't be considered an incitement.

	The region was carved up using an existing population, not by
importing one from a different country.

	Like Mr. May, I have no problems with anyone who wants to live
anywhere in peace and co-existence.

	The Israeli government is not interested in that, if it were
politically possible, they'd do the same to the Palistanians as the Germans
tried to do to them.

	You seem to be saying that Conquest by Force Of Arms is acceptable,
then the PLO is still trying to take back what they lost.

petro@playboy.com----for work related issues. I don't speak for Playboy.
petro@bounty.org-----for everthing else.      They wouldn't like that.
                                              They REALLY
Economic speech IS political speech.          wouldn't like that.
