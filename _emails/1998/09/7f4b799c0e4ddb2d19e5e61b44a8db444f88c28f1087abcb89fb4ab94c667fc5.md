Well back when I lived in Israel during the early '80s everyone had guns,
and a lots of them. My landlord had a small armory in his bombshelter
(something ever home has). I do not know what the gun laws are there
concerning non-military citizens, but considering that everyone is in the
military this doesn't seem to be much of an issue (unless you are a
Palestinian).

Nice country to live, good climate (comparable to southern California),
friendly people, civilized country, strong European influence to the
culture (for obvious reasons), parliamentary form of government. Inflation
was *very* bad when I was there (I think only Italy & Argentina was worse)
hopefully this has improved.

I left at the end of '82 before all this crap with the Palestinians
started. I don't know what shape basic liberties have taken since I have
left. I imagine that after 50 years of continual war things are a little
more restrictive than what most Americans are accustom to.
