True enough, though in Rushdie's case, the social environment
provided enough protection that the murder could be called for,
the reward could be offered, and several of Rushdie's associates
could be murdered without any resort to crypto.

At least if you want to publish something that you _know_ will
annoy people enough that they want to kill you, you can do it
more safely if you've got a range of options for anonymity.
