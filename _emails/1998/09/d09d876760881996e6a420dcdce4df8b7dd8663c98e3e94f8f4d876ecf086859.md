Here is Elke agian, it's been a while we've exchanged our e-mails.
I'd like to touch bases with you again on the 
Network Branch.

Are you still interested in setting your own business on the internet?

Our project is ready to be taken over. So you can run your branch 
of an International Dating, Matchmaking and Travel Service 
in your region.

We will provide for you all necessary setup, software, etc.,
and you can start making your money right away!
So, please get back to me on that.

Warmly,
Elke Winkler
Berlin, Germany
