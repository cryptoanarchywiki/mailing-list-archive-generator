This is somewhat tacky.  SecureDNS exists, and TIS got export approval
a while back to publish a "bones" version, minus encryption routines.
John Gilmore and his lawyer decided that, since it only does authentication,
not message encryption, it should be ok to publish _with_ the crypto
algorithms, and it's been quietly sitting on his web pages.
Recently the Feds sent him a letter saying "Oh, no, we didn't mean
it was OK to publish/export this encryption-based authentication system
just because the law says you can, so stop it"....
Now they're paying for another version.  Are they going to try something
DSS-based instead of RSA, just so you don't need encryption-capable
crypto with it, or is this going to be another scam?
Or is it just different parts of the Feds not talking to each other?
