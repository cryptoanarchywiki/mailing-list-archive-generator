Well, it seems I have an admirer. A follower, anyway. Quoting things I said
from two separate posts.
Persuasive, no. Revealing, yes.
I believe the other issues are relevant. When a person micro-focuses on one
instance of one issue, it is easily dismissable. That oversight, that
disregard of clear evidence of malfeasance in many, and every area should
not be ignored just because you think the issue should be simply (and only)
one particular instance of, shall we say, hormone driven behaviour, to put
it mildly.
I'm not building up the bogey man, I'm discussing what I see. What I see,
on every major and minor newstation, is a disgrace. A documented, public
record disgrace.

anonymouse, 32 bit aohell to boot. you must feel very safe. Yours is hardly
the type of post that might necessitate the use of a remailer, so it should
be safe to assume you haven't the courage to stand behind your words, even
as mild as they are.

Fuck you too. I suggest you discuss your lack of a spine with the maker.
See the above for instructions to meet the maker.
