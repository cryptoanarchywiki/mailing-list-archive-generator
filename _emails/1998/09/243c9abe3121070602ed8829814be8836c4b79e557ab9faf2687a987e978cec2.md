Oh Nita baby, say it ain't so!  What about all that time in the Congo?
What about those wombat hunting trips on the aborigine plains?  What
about when we made sweet love in a pile of rhinoceros shit, your fecal
fetish winning me over to our true love.

What about when you swore you'd always be true, even as you were
pissing in my mouth?  Oh that acrid, bittersweet flavor of entrails running
through my loins, that ache of razor sharp knives piercing my rectum,
and you said you'd always be there for me baby!

Well fine!  If that's the way you want it, Nita, you parking meter, you
pimple on the face of a whore, you jubilant muskrat sharpener!  Go back
to your twinkie stuffing, you'll never see me again!

Hurting,
Joe Camel
