This is more evidence of government trying to indoctrinate children. We
have the Pledge of Sheepegience, students encouraged to pressure anyone
who doesn't conform, school uniforms, clear backpacks, metal detectors,
kids being expelled for having asprin, and now students being "free" to
wear anything with a message, so long as it's a government-approved
message.

What difference does it make? Schools aren't teaching kids to read anyway.
Obviously, they're still learning.

I suggest that we ban all literacy right now! It allows people to read
disruptive texts! Fahrenheit 451 forever! Ra ra ra!

One would think that the fact that it's being worn by a fifth grader, and
that it has cartoon characters on it would tend to make it more of a joke
than anything else.

I guess that the kids of today aren't smart enough to read backwards
either.

Yes. You only want them to promote attitudes which cover the government
seal of approval.

Oh, I get it. "Freedom for me, but not for thee." She's basically bitching
because she wasn't given the decision about what rights to abridge.

The funny thing about these people hating sex is that they do it, and if
people don't do it the species dies. The downright sad thing about the
"illegal activities" comment is that just about everything is illegal now,
but she's too stupid to realize it.

Wait! I thought Mary Wilhelm said that "parents should have the right to
dress their children with any clothes they want to as long as they do not
promote sex, drugs, alcohol, TOBACCO..."

As opposed to "illegal activities." Well, at least as the school claims.

But you want to be able to tell everybody else what they can and can't do
with their's.

People like this disgust me. That includes the principal and the mother.
