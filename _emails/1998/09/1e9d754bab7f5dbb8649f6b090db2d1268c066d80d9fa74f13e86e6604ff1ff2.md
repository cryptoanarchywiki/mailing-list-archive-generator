 Nation's Attention Should Turn to 'Buying of Congress' Says Author
Charles Lewis
 To: National and Assignment Desks
 Contact: Marie Elena Martinez of Avon Books, 212-261-6903

   News Advisory:

   "America's citizens have been so distracted by the barrage of
commentary, testimony and endless supposition about the President
Clinton/Monica Lewinsky saga that Capitol Hill lawmakers have had a
reprieve from even the limited amount of scrutiny that normally
surrounds their activities," says Charles Lewis, whose THE BUYING OF
THE CONGRESS: How Special Interests Have Stolen Your Right to Life,
Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness, written with The Center For
Public Integrity, has just been published.  He points out that while
the nation focuses on whether or not President Clinton should be
impeached, no one is scrutinizing the acts of grand larceny committed
by Congress every day.

   "The attention being paid to the current scandal means that
nobody's minding the store, and the store -- Congress -- needs
minding," says Lewis pointing to the ever-increasing influence of
big-money special interests and the impact this has on people's
lives every single day.  Just a few of the detrimental results
of Congress's love affair with special interests, as detailed
in THE BUYING OF THE CONGRESS, are: little or no action on Social
Security, the continued threat to life from e-coli contamination
and other poisoned foods, the loss of full health benefits,
the number of people who must hold two jobs to make ends meet,
the enormous drop in the percentage of federal tax revenue paid
by corporations, and low voter turnout.  "We've found that members
of Congress moonlight for themselves and their wealthy patrons
more than they work for us," says Lewis who then enumerates
"employers" as varied as Lockheed-Martin, Ameritech, the National
Right to Life PAC, and the National Rifle Association.

   Among the people who are most vocal in their condemnation of
President Clinton during this tumultuous time are several whose
career patrons are publicly identified for the first time in THE
BUYING OF THE CONGRESS, including Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich
(R-GA), and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-MO).

   "With the elections just six weeks away, we can't afford to
overlook Congress's own misdeeds," says Lewis.
