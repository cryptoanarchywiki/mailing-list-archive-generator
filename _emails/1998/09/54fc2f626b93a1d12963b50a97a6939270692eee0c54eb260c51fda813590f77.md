Stephen King is no horror writer, he's a pussy wanna be. If you want a really
good author then check out Poppy Z. Brite.

Lost Souls (read this one first) 
Drawing Blood
Exquisite Corpse (if you've ever wondered if you were the least bit
                  homophobic, when you finish this one you'll know)

You'll either read about 2-3 pages and quit in utter refulsion and disgust
or else you'll be hooked.

Sombody else to try is:

Grave markings
Michael A. Arnzen

Ann Rice? Give me a break...
