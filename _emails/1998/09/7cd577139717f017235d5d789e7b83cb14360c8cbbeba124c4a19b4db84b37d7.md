> nnburk[SMTP:nnburk@cobain.HDC.NET] posted 10 predictions
about life in the USA  for the next 10 or 15 years.

They are, of course, nothing but descriptions of what's been going
on for the last  30-40 years. This isn't prediction, it's extrapolation!

As so often the people will always win when playing
"cheat the prophet". Whatever really  happens next year 
the chances are it won't be  exactly the same as what happened 
last year.
