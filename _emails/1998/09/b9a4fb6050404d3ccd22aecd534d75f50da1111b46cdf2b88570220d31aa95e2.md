	Ummm, I live in the middle of Chicago, I don't think it's going to
be anytime soon.

	Yeah, but it's harder to get than Air, which can be done with a
bicycle pump.

	Did you see the part where I mention that I am (a) an ex-marine,
and that (b) whilst in the Marine Corpse I was in Aircraft Firefighting and
Rescue? You ever seen 3000 gallons of jet fuel burn, and it was your job to
get up close and personal with a fire hose.

	5 gals. of burning gasoline is NOT a problem. 5 Gals. cooking off
in a sealed container IS a problem.

>You don't live anywhere near me do you?

	You live in S.F. right?

>You should try baking bread instead.

	Boring.

>Don't you think this conversation should be continued on some AOL forum?

	Fuck you.
