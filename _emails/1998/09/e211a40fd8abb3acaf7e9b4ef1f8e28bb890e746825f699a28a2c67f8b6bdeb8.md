The *point* is neither word definition or philosophy, the point *is* the
5,000+ years of human history that define the issues related to the
individual, political expression, and religous freedom. The meaning is in
the context (not the medium - respects to Marshall).

In your mind. You make the same mistake bejillions before you have made and
continue to make. Just because you are satisfied with it is no justification
to foist it off on me or to expect it will satisfy me. As Santyana said,

Those who don't understand history are doomed to repeate it.

This is why it is important to not fall into your 'relativistic' abolition
of history.

Absolutely, well except for one very important point. It isn't your claiming
it's my religion that makes it so, it's my claiming it that makes it so.
What *you* claim is my religion is irrelevant and immaterial.

If we follow your plan we would outlaw anything that couldn't be reduced to
an equation in some predicate calculus. There is more in heaven and earth
than in your philosophy Horatio.
