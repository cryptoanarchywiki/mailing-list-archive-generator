Once they realize people are doing this, they will begin taking hashes or
some other record of the blank space. The next time you are scanned by
customs, they pull the record and compare the previous "blank"  space with
the current "blank" space. If they don't match, you're suspect. 

They still cannot prove that you're carrying hidden data. They ask you if
you know what stego is. They ask you if you have hidden data on your
drive. If you say yes, they demand to see it. If you say no, they say
"Okay, then it should be no problem if we push the wipe button on our
program, should it?" 

If they start doing that they have still won, because now you are not
carrying the data across the border or the data is destroyed as you cross
the border.
