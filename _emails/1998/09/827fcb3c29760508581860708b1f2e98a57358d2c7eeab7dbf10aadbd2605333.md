UPDATE!!!!

SHOWDOWN AT THE FCC!!!

FREE RADIO ACTIVISTS MARCH ON WASHINGTON TO CONFRONT THE GLOBAL MEDIA
MONOPOLY AND THEIR MARIONNETTES IN GOVERNMENT!

Sunday October 4th and Monday October 5th

Calling all media activists, radio pirates, people for a democratic media
and people just fed up with crappy corporate radio:

Come to DC for the first national mobilization for free radio.
Microbroadcasters from around the country will gather for two days to
share radio skills, organize alliances, speak out to the media and protest
at the FCC and NAB buildings, culminating in a live broadcast straight
into the offices of the people working so hard to shut us down. Free Radio
Berkeley, Radio Mutiny, Steal This Radio and other microstations have all
broadcasted live in public and challenged the FCC to shut them down in the
light of day, in front of the press and the Feds have never dared to show
their face- this time, we're going to take it right to their doorstep and
tell them that if they're so sure that their dumb law is worth enforcing,
then the Chairman should come down from the 8th floor and put the cuffs on
us himself. There will also be workshops to help new folks start stations,
appointments will be made to lobby congress people, and press events will
be held to show the true, diverse face of the microbroadcasting movement.
