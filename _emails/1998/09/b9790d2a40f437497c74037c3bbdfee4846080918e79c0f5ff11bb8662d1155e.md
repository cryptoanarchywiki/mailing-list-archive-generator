Chain letter: Poor Timothy Flyte. He's dying of ostriopliosis of the liver
and is urging Internet users to forward his electronic chain letter to
everyone in their address books. The letter says a children's hospital will
donate 7 cents to the National Disease Society for every person who forwards
the letter. But wait: There is no such disease as ''ostriopliosis,'' there
is no such thing as the National Disease Society and the name Timothy Flyte
apparently was taken from Peter O'Toole's character in the movie Phantoms.
At the end, the letter includes a threat to those who don't forward it that
''what goes around comes around.'' This piece of e-junk is a particularly
loathsome example of Internet chain letters. If you receive this letter or
any other electronic chain letter, do the world a favor: Delete it without
forwarding it to anyone and inform the person who sent it to you that the
letter is a hoax. For the full story on this letter, see The Mining Co.'s
guide to urban legends.
