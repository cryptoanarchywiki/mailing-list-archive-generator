Here's the deal...

if someone gets a copy of the archives to me somehow, I 
pledge that I will get them  burned and will distribute 
them for cost price. I assume there will be two CDs as the 
data is apparently around 1GB. I have already checked, and 
for a run of 300 (should be enough to cover all the 
non-apathetic CP list members) the costs are:
     DM1,67 = 92 cents each
     = $1,84 + VAT = $2,15.
Add postage onto this.

A really great idea would be to include the coderpunks 
archive on any space that were left over. But first of all, 
I'll keep the focus as the greatest enemy of 'good' is 
'great'.

Note: IMPORTANT: The rep was emphatic - you shouldn't 
forget that this price includes *2 color* labelling! Makes 
the offer kind of irresistable doesn't it?

Why am I doing this? Because just as Tim pointed out, this 
has been discussed more than once but there have been no 
results. At least none that I have heard of in the last 
year.

One point - I am outside of the US. Good for europeans, but 
perhaps a little expensive for US-CPs. Maybe someone would 
like to take over the US distribution. (WHGIII?) I could 
get 50% to the states for distribution.

Anyone wants to arrange this with me, contact me off-list. 
If no one does, then I'll start bugging people until 
something happens <g>... 

Ian
