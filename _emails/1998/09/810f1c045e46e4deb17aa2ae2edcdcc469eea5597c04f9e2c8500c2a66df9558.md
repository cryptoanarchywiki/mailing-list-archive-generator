Ah come on, it isn't that bad.  Just put it on a crypto site with some
dumb revolving password scheme, or give it to someone else to put no
theirs.  It'll be on replay with-in a few hours, if anyone is
interested in the code.

Also you seem happy using remailers, so you could as easily publish
anonymously.

Don't let a few cold war hang-over export regs stifle your crypto
coding creativity!
