Through the *magic* of taxation and government contracts the opponents
you are so casually dismissing as dull-witted drones are your peers. So
unless you really are smarter than everyone else I would say that your
above statement is rash.

If the motivation to snoop is strong enough the resources will be put
into place by the current crop of ground-dwelling representatives and
any imaginable technology could be applied to the *problem*. I doubt in
this case, at this time, that the motivation is enough to pay for a
database of EMI analyses of PC bootups.

I found this one interesting: http://www.jya.com/fbi-en7898.htm
Our elected representatives probably believe this official-looking
analysis more than they do mere citizen's opinions.

I have LOTS of copper materials. I have a source for conductive paints.
Could you suggest a good source for ferrites in powder and tile form?

All this to insure my privacy whilst I compute in my own house! The
snoopers have, by their very existence, a chilling effect on speech.
