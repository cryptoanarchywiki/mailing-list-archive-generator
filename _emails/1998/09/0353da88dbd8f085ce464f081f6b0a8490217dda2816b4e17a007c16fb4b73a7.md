Yes Canada has export restrictions, which are handled by the Department of
Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT). The particular act you
should be interested in is the "Export and Import Control Act of Canada."
The DFAIT freely distributes "A Guide to Canada's Export Controls" which
was updated in 1996, and is available from the International Trade Centers
of the Gov't of Canada, see the blue pages in your phone book.

Excerpts from the Export Control List of Canada 
<http://axion.physics.ubc.ca/ECL.html> outline the regulations relating to
'Information Security' which includes encryption.

Encryption software may fall under the "General Software Note":
------------
This List does not embargo "software" which is either:

a.Generally available to the public by being: 
  1.Sold from stock at retail selling points, without restriction, by
  means of: 
    a.Over-the-Counter transactions; 
    b.Mail order transactions; or 
    c.Telephone call transactions; and 
  2.Designed for installation by the user without further substantial
  support by the supplier; or 
b.In the public domain". 

>From the definitions of pp 49-55

"In the public domain" 
  As it applies to the International Lists, means "technology" or 
"software" which has been made available without restrictions upon its
further dissemination.
N.B.
Copyright restrictions do not remove "technology" or "software" from being
"in the public domain".
