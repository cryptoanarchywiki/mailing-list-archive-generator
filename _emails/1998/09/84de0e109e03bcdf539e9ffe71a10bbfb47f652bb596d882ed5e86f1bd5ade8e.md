If we are talking philosophies of the range to include 'natural philosophy'
(ie physics) then you are correct. Fortunately, this attempt at shifting the
topic of discussion away from personal or individual philosophies relating
to the relationship between individuals, God, and the cosmos  won't work.

This is called a straw-man. Pick an argument that you want to (dis)prove but
don't know how. Then pick a similar but non-identical (or fail to prove the
identity) which one knowns how to (dis)prove. Finaly claim that the second
easier (since it is (dis)provable) problem is identical to the first.

And trying to change the subject of discourse is as well. A philosophy is a
set of beliefs, period. In this particular case we are discussing personal
or individual philosophies and from definition and practice they are
identical. Religion after all is nothing more than a set of beliefs and
therefore falls under 'personal philosophy'.

Just remember this, it's your ugly baby.

Changing the side on which the 'do not' resides doesn't change the meaning.
These two sentences are identical in content and meaning.

I belive god does not exist

I do not believe god exists

or,

^(A) = (^A)

Whether I believe in them makes no difference to their existance (you really
really need to quit taking drugs). This is the same sort of crap reasoning
the UFO nut-cases partake in. They run around asking "Do you believe in
aliens?" when the question that needs asking is "How do we prove aliens have
been here?", and in many cases they take the two to be equivalent.

Hindu pantheon is a different form of Pantheism that I practice. I don't
agree with many of the points that Hindu, Aztec, Buddhist, New Age, etc.
pantheist practice, it's too anthropocentric for my taste and in the case
of New Age Pantheism (gag) they've simply given transcendance a new form.
And I further believe that the Hindu practice of sweeping ants out of ones
way and wearing a veil to inhibit bug inhalation is taking it too far the
other way (though I respect and practice the spirit of their actions).

Respect does not mean subserviance.

I'm not trying to prove anything, you are. I'm just blowing holes in your
reasoning.

Ohhhh, supernatural is by definition in this discussion equivalent to
transcendental. I'll say it again, there are two types of religion - those
who believe transcendentalism exists (ie traditional religions) and those
that don't (eg Pantheism). It is not reasonable nor logical to expect the
natural rules of experience to be recognized by the supernatural. 

Now I can inquire into many things without using a particular type of logic
(you keep writing as if there is only one form of logic - perhaps this is
the root shortcoming in your reasoning). So trying to say that inquiry is
equivalent to using logic is a misunderstanding of both inquiry and logic.

The question that you are skirting around is:

If God exists and created the universe, does this imply that it is
constrained by that creation?

You can answer that question with three answers:

Yes	Pantheism and some other forms of pagan religions

No	Traditional religions

?	Agnostic (if you'd like to know,
        Nihilism (if you believe the question is irrelevant),
        etc.

Transcendence is the belief that there is something more than the earthly
veil. In other words, if you practice a transcendantal religion then by
definition you believe in a ghost-in-the-machine of one form or another.

If you like you can think of it as one set of religions believes there is
purpose and reason in existance whereas others believe that it is all random
dice (and yes that is a broad brush I'm painting with).
