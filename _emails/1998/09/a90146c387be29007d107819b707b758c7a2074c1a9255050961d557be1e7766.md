What did I say about not paying for people's work?  I'm perfectly
happy to pay for code, and I prefer to buy open source code; it tends
to be higher quality.  I don't want to have to accept your opinion on
how I should release code along with the code.

| Prevents what, releasing commercial code within a L/GPL'ed context? No, it
| doesn't. What it does do is *guarantee* that the customer has some chance of
| understanding what his code does (it's called code review and is highly

| used in.

	You're being intentionally obtuse.  I excluded the L/GPL from
my comments, and you respond to them as if I was discussing the
L/GPL.	Further, I said above that using code thats been reveiwed is
better from a security perspective.
