 The first amendment states only that there shall not be 'an 
establishment of religion' it says nada about 'separation of church and 
state.'  The intention was simple; that there would never be an 
'official' state religion. It didn't say religion had no place. They were 
escaping a regime with an established state religion that used the 
goverment to stamp out religious deviationism. That was the sole reason 
for that clause in the 1st amendment.
