If you can't trust your elected officials to live up to their word, in other
words if they will lie under oath on something this immaterial then how do
you trust him to live up to the oath he took when he took office?

He asked, wasn't drafted, to have the peoples trust placed in him and then
he reniged.

Not at all, it simply recognizes that any public official with a record of
lying under oath is not fit to hold office.
