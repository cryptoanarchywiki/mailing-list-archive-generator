Yes.

We have some jokester sitting in Washington with full authority over our
military forces. The people can't believe a word he says. Congress can't
believe a word he says. He rules by executive order. He ignores the
Constitution.

There is argument over whether he ordered military strikes to divert
attention from his scandal and whether he sold the country out to the Red
Chinese. Now people like myself are thinking - totally justified - that
this guy will do absolutely anything to hold on to his presidency.

I don't feel particularly secure with some guy who I can't trust running
the military and with his finger on the nuclear button. That itself is a
violation of national security.
