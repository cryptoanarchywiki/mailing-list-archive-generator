If any of you are in the UK anytime, you can get free dialup using the
following recently posted details:

> Login = FREE256974
> Password = cypherpunk
> 
> To connect FREE to 33.6Kbps access or 28.8Kbps please use 0845 662 1009
> To connect FREE to K56Flex access please use 0845 662 1109
> To connect FREE to 56K X2 access please use 0845 662 1209
> To connect FREE to 64K ISDN access please use 0845 662 1309

In the UK local calls are not free (about 1p/min offpeak).  The ISP
for the above service (www.aardvaak.co.uk) gets it's income via a
commission on the phone calls to their dialup numbers.

(Most ISPs in the UK charge 10 UKP/month, and you have to pay the
local call on top).

Anyway the interesting part is the degree of anonymity it gives, as
they don't need payment from you, they don't need to know who you are.

Also there is www.freenet.co.uk, they offer pop3 mail accounts, and
usenet access, but if you already have an ISP you probably don't want
all that.
