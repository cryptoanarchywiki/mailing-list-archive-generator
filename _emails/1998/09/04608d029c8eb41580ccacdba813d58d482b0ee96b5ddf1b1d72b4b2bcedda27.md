Yes it is quite obvious that there is a difference from being *forced* to
give up your land, and willingly selling it. As I said before NO ONE WAS
FORCED OFF THEIR LAND until after the war that the arabs started. When war
did start it was the arabs that were trying to use FORCE to push the Jews
off of the land that they had legally purchased!!

Please explain why Israel is an "artificial" country while the rest of the
countries from the old Ottoman Empire were not? How much say did EVERYONE
have when the British set up KINGDOMS in countries like Saudi Arabia,
Jordan, Egypt? Until recently Israel was the *ONLY* democracy in that
region. IIRC Jordan and Egypt are the only arab countries that practice
any form of democracy at all (and Jordan still has a powerfull king as its
head of state).
