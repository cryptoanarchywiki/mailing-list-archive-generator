That's the rub, in transcendental religions with this as a proviso it
becomes impossible to even talk about God, he transcends the natural world
and escapes any hope of comprehension other than a simple label.

In effect transcendental religions have defined themselves into a circle.

They define God as something undefinable and then claim that anyone who
counters their beliefs is at fault because they can't define God.
