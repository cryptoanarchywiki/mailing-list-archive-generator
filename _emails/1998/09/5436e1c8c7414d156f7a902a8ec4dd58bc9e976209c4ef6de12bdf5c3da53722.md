>    Polytechnic, after attending secondary school at Arau and graduated
>    there in the spring of 1900 as a secondary school teacher of
>    mathematics and physics. By then he had given up German citizenship in
>    favor of Swiss, to avoid the draft. He worked about two month as a
>    mathematics teacher, before he was employed as examiner at the Swiss
>    patent office in Bern. Having now a certain economic security he
>    married Mileva Maric, his university girlfriend three years later.

>    Early in 1905 he published a thesis, "A New Determination of Molecular
>    Dimensions" in the prestigious physics monthly "Analen der Physik"
>    which won him a Ph.D. from the University and was the begin of the end
>    for the old view of the universe. Previous
