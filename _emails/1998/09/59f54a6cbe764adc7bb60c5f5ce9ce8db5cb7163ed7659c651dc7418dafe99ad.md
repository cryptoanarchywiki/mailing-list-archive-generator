If we are discussing only the customs inspector doing a visual inspection
this will certainly work. It won't hold up to TEMPEST analysis where they 
fingerprint a known un-mod'ed unit and then compare that to yours. The
POST shouldn't change from laptop to laptop, irrespective of the filesystem
or OS that is actualy installed.

The point is that this is a weak approach with a variety of attacks open.
When one considers the amount of work required to collect BIOS'ed , reverse
engineer them (unless you got lots of mullah), develop the crypto,
develop the camouflage code, distribute the code, burn the ROM's, distribute
the ROM's, cost of suitable TEMPEST monitors, etc. the benefit seems
questionable at best.

Even if they can't crack it in may places (eg France) such actions would
be prosecutable in and of themselves.
