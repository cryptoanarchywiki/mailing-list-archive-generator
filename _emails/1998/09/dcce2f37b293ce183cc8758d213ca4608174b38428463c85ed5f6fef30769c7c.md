I used PGP to make an m to match a 1024 bit n which I presumed from a
1024 bit s; s is from the signature packet from the signed post in
question.  I made the assumption that for a 1024 bit s, the padded
message digest m would be of size 1024 bit also, with it's leading 00
01 FF ... FF etc.

I see what you are saying: that if n had been even 1032 bits, it would
still be possible (though relatively unlikely) to result in a s <
1024, which would mean that the m I presumed could have had been a
byte longer.  I think your assumption that PGP would not encode the
leading 0 byte (in the s) is correct, from past PGP code tinkering.
In fact I guess that actually this statement generalises and (with an
even smaller probability) the n could have been 1040 bits, and the s
just happened to come out < 1024 bits, and so on.

I'll see if I can induce this effect by generating a 1025 bit key, and
seeing if any of the signatures come out at 1024 bits:

n =	0x0181291263B847EBEBFDC65E9128DDE9015522B461618F43CDBBF3D707507BA9
	  A71B002F4F852EEC1465710B1641C8816D3E0851C41C2A11E89062E424116A69

e =	0x11
s =	0x5AA544A471AA79074796D0C85BE01DF44BBED7F14C1189D2D114F8A4E9D4D20E
	  1E67ED9CFA8E20F4D9B84B9C82918F5721D984C7D3A2E2561D399982DFD38873

So yes, n = 1025 bits, and this particular s is 1023 bits, and this
one is 1025 bits:

s' =	0x012B4B5218E1173DCEF5525C3E9E72BA962371372DA9E9D8D1B469A3BD1060E1

(most of them work out to be < 1025 bits).

Yes, you are right.  

Presented with two public keys (n,e), and (n',e') and a signature s,
that even if the attacker manages to factor n but not n' the attacker
can't prove that there isn't another public key (n'',e'') which is the
real key which signed the message.  Ie the reason the attacker is
unable to factor (n',e') may be either because it is a multiple of two
512 bit primes, or because it is a mutliple of primes of special form
I quoted a post describing in the other post, and he doesn't have
enough compute to recover it.  With the quoted algorithm from Maurer,
the attacker needs more compute to show that the key has a special
form than you do to create the key.
