What law?  This was consensual sex.  No law was broken.  Judgment and
morality, of course, are different issues.

Clinton, like anyone else, is required to tell the truth when being deposed
or testifying in front of a Grand Jury, i.e., making any statement under oath.

I'm not in a position to comment because I'm not sure who the major players
were at the time the legislation was enacted.  Generally speaking, when the
president belongs to Party A, the majority of the Legislature belongs to
Party B.

Regarding political parties, I am an NPA (no party affiliation) and can
only vote in general elections.  I made this choice because I do not wish
to be "pigeon-holed" by a label imposed upon me as a result of belonging to
a given political party.  In the same vein, I am unable to speak for
"feminists", "normal people", "politicians", etc.  I speak only for myself. ;)
