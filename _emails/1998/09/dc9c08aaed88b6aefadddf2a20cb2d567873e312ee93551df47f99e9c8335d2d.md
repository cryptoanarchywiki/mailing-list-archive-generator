Okay, so you're getting a shell account, good for you.

Something smells vaguely like rotten tuna, you already have 100 accounts on a
local ISP. Why does anyone need more than one account on any ISP?  That being
the case, why do you need another account for on a SunOS box?

If the ISP is >>>>LOCAL<<<< to you, why do you need to dial AOL to use all the
32 bit TCP/IP protocols?  Why not dial up to the ISP and use PPP? Why do you
need to post from AOL when you can post from one of your over 100 ISP accounts?

Damn straight it's stupid, but not your mom: So fucking which is it?  Either
you have a hundred (and now 101) accounts on local ISP's >OR< you're forced to
use AOL by your clueless mom.

That's obvious.  Some of them have over 100 accounts on the same ISP, and are
truly so full of shit, that they're swimming in it.  Kid, by bullshiting, all
you're doing is enforcing the view that AOL users are really AOLusers.
