Dear Mr Gordon,

   When I checked the
   digital signature on the Internet death threat using the PGP software
   and JOHNSON'S secret key ring, the computer identified the signature
   as one of the signature keys stored in JOHNSON'S computer. Because
   both the "private" and "public" portions of the "key" were stored on
   JOHNSON'S computer, the message can be authenticated as having been
   generated by the person who possessed this "secret key" and knew the
   correct password. In other words, only the person possessing the
   secret key found on JOHNSON'S computer could have generated the "death
   threat" message.

Why would you claim only one person possessed the secret key? As you
doubtlessly know, some of the TruthMonger secret keys have been posted
to Cypherpunks anonymously. This is not authentication. Thank you.
