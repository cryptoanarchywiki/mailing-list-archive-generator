I read all the posts to cypherpunks. Some several times to try to
understand what some blowhard is trying to say.

My argument was:
1. You can't seriously be this fired up over perjury (post OJ), can you?
2. there have been several topics discussed on cypherpunks that were more odious.
3. Charge him with his big crimes. Don't "Al Capone" him.

Your belief that Starr is leading up to the real issues is compatible with my
(now belaboured) point. I still don't understand what you're trying to add.

Well, this *is* a pathetic reason. You want Clinton impeached because the
media tells you so.

Fine. charge him with the other things!

As far as the "newby" flame, I've seen that corpse lists here twice recently.
Maybe you've dated yourself? I remember a time without Reeza! posts... 

And there's a sig flame in there, trying to get out. A new low for you, Reeza?
