	Passphrase at startup. One phrase allows access to the "stego'd" areas,
the other allows access to the "cover" areas.

	This wouldn't stand source code inspection, but if you used some
sort of Pretty Lousy Privacy on the "cover" data, and an uncompromised
crypto on the rest you might pass all but the most rigourous investigation.

	Of course, if you are getting an extremely rigourous investigation,
you don't need good crypto, you need good PR, and a good lawyer because
they WILL find something, unless they think hanging your butt will cause
riots.
