In reply to my suggestion that lieing under oath isn't
a very good reason for impeachment,

I agree it's bad. I agree it undermines the justice system a little bit.
But, ... impeachment?

You're not charging him with murder (eg WACO), attacking the 1st ammendment (CDA),
the 4th (SSN on driver's licences), the 5th (GAK). You're going after Al Capone
for tax evasion. You want to get him because he's a Bad Person not because of
the particular crime. This is ironic, because his crimes against our basic
rights were committed while pursuing Bad People, but it is also hypocritical.
