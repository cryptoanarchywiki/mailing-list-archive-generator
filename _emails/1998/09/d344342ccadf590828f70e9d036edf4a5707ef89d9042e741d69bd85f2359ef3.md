September 29, 1998 --from Congressman Barr's web site

BARR EXPOSES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE POWER GRAB

WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Representative Bob Barr (GA-7) released today
information exposing an effort by the Department of Justice to obtain
massive new enforcement powers in the closing days of the 105th Congress. Barr
obtained the information from a confidential source within federal law
enforcement.  Among other things, the Department's "wish list" for new
authority includes (among others):

A vastly expanded definition of terrorism to include domestic crimes
having no relationship to terrorism.

The power to seize commercial transportation assets for federal use.

The ability to commander personnel from other federal agencies without
reimbursement.

Expanded wiretap authority to allow "roving" wiretaps, and wiretaps
without any court authority.

Enlarged asset forfeiture provisions to allow the FBI to seize personal
property in both criminal and civil matters.

The establishment of a permanent "FBI Police Force."

Loosening of Posse Comitatus restrictions to allow more military
involvement in domestic law enforcement.

Authority to force telephone and Internet companies to divulge
information on their customers.

"These requests belong in some bizarre conspiracy novel, not in serious
legislative documents being circulated at the top levels of federal law
enforcement.  These proposals represent a sneak attack on the most cherished
principles of our democracy.  If they become a part of our law, freedom and
privacy in America will be permanently and severely diminished," said Barr.

Barr also noted the Department and the FBI are "shopping" this wish list
in an effort to get the items placed in a spending measure without hearings
or debate.
