Female subordinates have no power to consent under current
civil law, any more than children do.

If a boss has sex with a secretary, he is liable,
irrespective of her consent.

But there are limits as to what questions he can ask his
accusers, and until recently there were limits as to what
question his accusers could ask him.  The limits have been
abolished for one side, and tightened for the other side.

These laws are flagrantly unjust, but the Democrats
introduced them and applied them.  Feminists supported and
continue to support Clinton precisely because he supported
and supports laws that he flagrantly broke.  If these laws
are to be repealed for politicians, they should be repealed
for normal people as well.
