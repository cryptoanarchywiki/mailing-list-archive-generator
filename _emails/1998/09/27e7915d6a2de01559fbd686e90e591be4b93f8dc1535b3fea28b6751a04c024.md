Bear in mind that that information on this matter may be used to 
hammer or help Carl Johnson if not others.

As Adam Back has proposed: 

To check the validity of the allegations made by the IRS about 
Toto(s)'s messages in the Carl Johnson complaint, a review 
is underway of archived messages to see if there are any signatures 
by a key before the private key has been posted, especially if 
the post in question has been (or may be later) cited by the IRS.  

If there are none, then the IRS "authentication" of the claimed 
Toto posts evaporates.  Even if there are some, the `authentication' 
becomes more suspect if there are others which are made after the 
key post.

To assist checking messages an initial list of candidate keys is 
available (none of the anonymous keys show a link to Carl Johnson
of the IRS complaint):

   http://jya.com/anon-keys.htm

Additional candidates and findings of message checks are welcomed,
with a nod to the opening caution.
