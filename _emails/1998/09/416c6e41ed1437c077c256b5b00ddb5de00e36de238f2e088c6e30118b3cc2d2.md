   Congress to Debate CDA II This Morning
   By Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)

   It was one thing to vote for the Communications Decency Act, as
   Congress did before the Supreme Court ruled that it was violently
   unconstitutional. It's quite another to knowingly circumvent that
   ruling by voting for its successor, as a Congressional panel may do
   this morning. At 10 AM this morning a House Commerce subcommittee is
   scheduled to debate Rep. Mike Oxley (R-Ohio)'s CDA II, and free speech
   advocates are in a tizzy.
