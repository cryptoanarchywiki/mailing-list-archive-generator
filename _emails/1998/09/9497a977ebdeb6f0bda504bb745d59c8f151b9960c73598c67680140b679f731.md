A freshly formatted partition has a fill value. Noise would indicate
that is is not fresh. This would not be proof that it contained
encrypted data but it would indicate some sort of use. 

Another layer: 
	create a partition. 
	Use it as an archive for 'unclassified' materials. 
	At some point after the use has fragmented it enough to look real:
		disable all automatic accesses ( temp files, caches ... ) to the
partition
		create an application program that uses the unused space as a secure
filesystem

Then the partition would be arguably "in normal use" and it could get
tough to prove the nature of the unused space. You could even leave some
space filled with the format fill value. Not sure how to hide the app.
maybe as passphrased option in some innocuous custom application.
Accounting app?

The possibility of them taking a hash and saving it for later comparison
is a problem.

Just do a drive ID command and you can figure out how many logical
sectors are there. Add up the elements in the partition table and look
for a difference. Unused space -esp that filled with noise- is suspect.

Just the existence of a "hidden" partition might might get the juices
flowing.

It would be truly beautiful if you could alter the drive firmware to
identify itself as a 3Gb drive when it was actually a 5 Gb drive. Add
some kind of extended command to the drive that allowed you to
activate/deactivate the extended region at will. Without a password of
course, the additional command would just report the appropriate error.
Then just make sure you have an extra slot in the partition table to
address the extended region unless you want to write a low-level driver.

Any Quantum or Maxtor persons on the list?

Security requires hardware and software.
