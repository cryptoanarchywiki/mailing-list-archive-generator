It occured to me that it might be feasible to ship such devices seperately
via Fed-Ex or whatever. The question becomes, what do such countries as
Great Britian plan for materials crossing their borders in this manner? Are

mean for Dell and their ilk? The ramifications of this aspect are of some
interest...
