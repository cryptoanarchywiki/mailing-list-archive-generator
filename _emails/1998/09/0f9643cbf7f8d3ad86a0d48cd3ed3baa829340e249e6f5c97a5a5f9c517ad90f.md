I last served on a jury in 1973, 25 years ago, no doubt before many readers
of Cypherpunks were born.

And I've only received a single _possible_ summons since, in the 25 years
since that  one jury appearance.

Yet some of the apolitical numbskulls I know about have served on several
juries in the same time. The Poisson, as expected, or something more human?

Jury nullifying minds want to know.
