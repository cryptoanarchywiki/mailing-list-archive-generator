Now, back to more intersting discussion...

You're going to seriously claim that 1 gallon of hemp oil is equivalent to 3
gallons of gasoline? I don't think so. I've seen hemp burn and it don't burn
anywhere near that efficiently.

I also notice it doesn't mention what it costs to raise that 4 tons/acre...
