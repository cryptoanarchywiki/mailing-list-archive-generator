Hello,

I was referred to you by Bert-Jaap Koops regarding some
advice on the legality of using PGP in Taiwan. I would 
be interested if someone knows what the law is and whether
there is preferred version of PGP ( the international version
I assume) that I should you. 

Any information you might have in this regard would be 
appreciated.
