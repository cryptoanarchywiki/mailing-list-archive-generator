1: In a free and open society one should be able to debate and analyze any
topic of their choosing, even your precious PC dogma. Rather than debate
the issues at hand you choose to use words like "flame-bait" and "troll"
in a weak and obvious attempt to minimize any criticism of your cherished
beliefs.

2: y'all <-- We wouldn't be trying to make an subtle ethnic slur here are
we. Oh I forgot the PC crowd can attack whites, jews, asians (if they make
too much money), southerners, ...ect and that's ok. Do you do this at
work? Are you creating a "hostile workplace" with your anti-souther bais??
Do you see how silly this whole "hostile workplace" concept is??

3: please define "hate-speech" and show where in the 1st Amendments or the
numerous SC ruling that there is "Freedom of Speech" except for speech
that *you* don't like. Please explain where your "right" not to be offened
is derived from.

This is strictly an issue of free speech. Wether you *like* what I have to
say is not an issue, I still retain the right to say it. The fact of
*where* I say it is irrelevant. If I want to tell a dirty joke, or make a
"racist" comment at work that is my *right* to do so. If my employer
objects to that behavior then it is his right to take whatever action he
feels necessary (upto and including fireing me). This is a matter between
myself and my employer and does not involve the courts or the politicians.

Oh no, you were not "forced", you willfully jumped right in with your
emotional dribble, fearful of open, objective, debate of your precious PC
dogma.
