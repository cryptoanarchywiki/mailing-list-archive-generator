PRZ,
  Some guys from the Secret Service came to see me about the Death
Threats
I've been sending you.
  It's pretty funny that after all those years of persecuting you, the
GuberMint
is now paying these guys to protect you, eh?

  They sure looked at me funny when I told them that it was all in good
humor,
and that I wouldn't dream of doing anything bad to the guy who wrote
PGP.
  Are you *sure* you wrote it? They don't seem to think so...

  Do you play the saxaphone? They said you play the saxaphone.

  Anyway, say "Hi!" to Buddy for me...

Your Pal and CoConspirator,
Toto
