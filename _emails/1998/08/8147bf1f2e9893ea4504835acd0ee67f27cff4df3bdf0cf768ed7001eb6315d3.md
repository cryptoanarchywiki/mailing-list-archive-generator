Folks,

This came to me via subliminal channel. I am neither the author of it, nor
do I make any claim that I have vetted the material. I'm posting it only to
honor the request of the sender. I can make no assertions as to its
validity, only that I'm forwarding it as I received it, without any
modifications save my signature and the space I prepended to the key block's
header and footer lines to avoid the normal signing-of-key problems some
might have.
