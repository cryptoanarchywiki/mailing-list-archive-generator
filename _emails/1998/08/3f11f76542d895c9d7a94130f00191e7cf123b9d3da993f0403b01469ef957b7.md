	Yet harassment is actionable.  Nutty, huh?  And it's just
	the tip of the iceberg:  apparently the law protects you
	from being severely beaten, despite the fact that there is
	no explicit constitutional right not to be severely beaten.

	Not trying to equate harassment with a severe beating, just
	pointing out that the lack of an explicit constitutional 
	right does not magically nullify the rest of the law.

	Indeed, "popular" speech is, almost by definition, the kind
	of speech that never really needs protection.  That first amendment
	wouldn't have much of a purpose if it only protected popular
	stuff.

	It WAS an internal company matter, apparently, but the 
	company didn't seem to do anything to remedy it.  That's 
	when you turn to law.
