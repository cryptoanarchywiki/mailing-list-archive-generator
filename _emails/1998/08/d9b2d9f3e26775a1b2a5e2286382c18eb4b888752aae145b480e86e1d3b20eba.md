Dear Mr. P,

Yes, we would be interested in a review of "The Friction-Free
Economy".

I should warn you that we are somewhat skeptical of Bill Gate's
terms like "fiction-free", or those views that say the whole
world operates like a computer company.

I am responding at the email address in your letter.  Reply
at my regular email address below.

Thanks,
