The first step is to swallow an entire bottle of Tylenol.  Then, to be
certain of your resilience (you have to be quite resilient to build a pipe
bomb), find the nearest highway overpass and jump off of it.  These
steps are crucial precursors to building a pipe bomb, and are much
more effective if you carry them out as soon as possible.  Like right
now.

Hope this helps.
