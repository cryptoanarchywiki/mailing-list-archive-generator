It works if you put the ".html" on the next line in the URL

New nifty way to foil the hackers - put line-breaks in your code!
They'll never suss it!

Actually  I didn't notice at first  either - I just sropped the last 
directory name of the URL and looked at the level above  - 
it's been a sort of reflex action of mine on the web for years.
Nice to see a navy site allowing us to browse their directories though
:-)

The "listwatch" is a very short summary of some of the less wibblish
threads in cypherpunks, risks et.c - it is about 6 weeks out of
date, nothing new there since it was last mentioned here. 

So I don't know why it was brought up again.
