The term is "linked list".  If you want to collect all the arbitrarily
long repeats you may have to resign yourself to a two-pass algorithm.
For small cryptograms like the ones I usually deal with, it's
sufficient to use an N^2 algorithm, looking at each starting point and
each possible offset to see whether a string of at least k characters
is duplicated at that offset.  For a longer file, off the top of my
head, you might start with a set of pointers for where each possible
digraph starts; you can use a linked list, storing all the starting
locations for each digraph (a two-dimensional array of pointers, total
size 64K).  On your second pass you can do an N^2 search within those
reduced sets to see which repeated digraphs can be extended.  It will
help a lot if your target ciphertext fits in memory.  I make no claim
that this is optimal.
