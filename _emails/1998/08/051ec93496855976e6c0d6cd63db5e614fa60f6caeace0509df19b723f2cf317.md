	It reads especially weirdly to anyone who remembers that BASIC
	was traditionally interpreted, too.  What crazy times we live in.  

	And anyone who wants to claim VB superior to FORTH has to
	earn the right by transferring first a FORTH-made binary, then
	a VB-made binary, from one computer to another via floppy
	disks.

	That's because writing in FORTH is like spending the day
	solving brain-teasers.  

	Not that that's a bad thing; I figure programmers would get
	paid a lot more for much higher quality work if they were required
	to be in extreme brain-on mode 24/7.  But at least we have C++,
	huh?
