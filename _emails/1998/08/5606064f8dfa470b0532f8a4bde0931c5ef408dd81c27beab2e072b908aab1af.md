Yea, well that's been a problem for years now, which makes it no less relevant today, but it's hardly news.

The author calls this condition at state of war.  He's quite right.  If the tyrant has any opposition it's
from the criminal class, with the liberty squad standing mainly on the side lines giving an occassional 
muffled cheer and sometimes looking on to see what kind of tactics are being used by the crooks with hopes
that they might learn some tactics they were not brave enough to employ themselves.

I do not, however, know of any war waged successfully where the opposition is as scattered as the liberty crowd is,
therefore, it is being waged on an individual basis with technology, stealth, and the occassional
government that has yet to bend its knee to Uncle Sammy (which, by the way, are becoming fewer, not more).
