I've  been reading the Bible lately, and it's content has been aiding
and
abetting me in all kinds of criminal misconduct, like murdering a
crapload of 
Arabs and other assorted non-Jewish darkies.
Anybody think that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is
prepared to refrain from being hypocritical, and rule that the Bible
does
not enjoy FirstAmendment protection?
