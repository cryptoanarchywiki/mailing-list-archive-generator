What about an analog filter placed before the digitizer? Nowadays there
should be inexpensive single-chip implementations of multiple-tap equalizers
made for consumer audio. You just have to straighten up the amplitude
ignoring the phase rotation, because the power spectrum is a real-codomain
function (being the Fourier Transform of the autocorrelation, which is an
even function). It won't be perfect, but it'll help.
