You'll fall in love with my Grandma's prize-winning salad 
dressing recipe. It has just the right touch of garlic, olive 
oil, and certain other old-world special ingredients. Best of 
all, it has the power to turn ordinary iceburg lettuce into 
something amazing. Whenever we serve it people ask for more 
salad! And they look at you like, "What's in this anyway?" 

It's a real bargain at only $2.00!
