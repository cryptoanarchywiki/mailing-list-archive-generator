The front page of today's Globe & Mail has a story about the CRTC
asking if it should regulate the Internet.

The front page story directs you to page A4 for the remainder, which
is actually on page A3.

On page A3 an incorrect URL for the CRTC releases.  The correct ones
are:

	http://www.crtc.gc.ca/ENG/NEWS/RELEASES/1998/R980731e.htm

	(press release)


	http://www.crtc.gc.ca/ENG/bcasting/notice/1998/p9882_0.txt

	(public notice in English)

All EFC members should write and say they are opposed to CRTC regulation.

Unfortunately, I am scheduled to leave for vacation tomorrow, but David
Jones will post this and perhaps suggest some sample letters to write
to the CRTC.

EFC will plan to attend the public hearings on the issue on November 23
in Hull, Quebec.
