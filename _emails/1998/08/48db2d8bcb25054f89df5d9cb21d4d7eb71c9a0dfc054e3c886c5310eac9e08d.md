	Ditto if you don't like the pay, or the way the boss keeps
	feeling you up, or that one catwalk over the chemical vats
	with the loose rivets that you have to stand on.

	I'm sure if it was as easy as just walking out of one job into
	a better one there would be no minimum wage, "harassment" in
	the workplace, labor unions or huge fines for companies who
	maintain grossly dangerous work environments.  Clearly, then,
	it ain't that easy.
