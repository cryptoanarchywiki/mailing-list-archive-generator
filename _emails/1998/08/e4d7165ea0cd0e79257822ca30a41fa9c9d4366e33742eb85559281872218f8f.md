The August meeting of the San Francisco Bay Area Cypherpunks will be
on Saturday, August 8 1998 from 12-6PM.  This is an open meeting, as
always, and the public is invited to attend.

The meeting will be held in two sequential locations this month.
We'll start with a tour of the recently announced Electronic Frontier
Foundation "DES Cracker", hosted by the company which built its
hardware.  Please join us between noon and 2PM at:

	Advanced Wireless Technologies
	3375 Scott Blvd #410 
	Santa Clara, CA  95054
	+1 408 727 5780

	http://www.mapblast.com/mapblast/blast.hm?CMD=MAP&GC=X%3A-121.98298%7CY%3A37.3812%7CLT%3A37.38063%7CLN%3A-121.98458%7CLS%3A20000%7Cc%3ASanta_Clara%7Cs%3ACA%7Cz%3A95054%7Cd%3A807%7Cp%3AUSA&LV=3&IC=37.3812%3A-121.98298&IC=100&IC%3A=AWT&IC=%3A%3A%3A%3A%3A%3A3A&GAD2=3375+Scott+Blvd+%23410&GAD3=Santa+Clara%2C+CA++95054-3110&W=500&H=350&MA=2

It's in a complex of small startups at the corner of Scott Blvd and
Garrett Drive in Santa Clara.  To reach it, take US 101 to the Bowers
Avenue exit (heading south/oceanward), turn right in a few blocks on
Scott Blvd, and turn right on Garrett.  The first two driveways on the
right serve the complex; AWT's corner of the parking lot is at the
second.  You can also come in via Lawrence Expressway; go
east/SanJoseward on Arques Avenue (which becomes Scott Blvd) and turn
left on Garrett.

Autographed copies of the Cracking DES book will be available, and
the machine will be running.

There isn't a room large enough to have a sit-down meeting at AWT, so
we'll reconvene at 2:30 at Stanford University, at the outdoor tables
outside Tresidder Union, which is near the bookstore.  The tables are
on the west side, which is the inside of the U-shape.  Coffee and food
are available in the building.

Agenda: 12:00-2:00 at the machine location, 
	then move to Stanford and reconvene at 2:30.
	Dinner at a mutually agreed location will probably follow.

Speakers:
	Cracking DES - John Gilmore et al, 2:30 at Stanford
	"Private Doorbells" - John Bashinski, ~3:30
