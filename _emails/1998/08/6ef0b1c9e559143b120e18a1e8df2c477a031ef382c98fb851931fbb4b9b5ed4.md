No, it does not, but unlike beating I *do* have a Constitutional right to
be objectionable as I want with my speech. A good example is the Nazi
march in Skokie,IL. The SC ruled that they had a right to march despite
the fact that the large Jewish community there was quite offended by it.

I see, so if a company and it's employees exercise their Constitutionally
protect right of free speech and does not stop exercising that right when
someone complains then the courts should take over? How does this match
with your agreement that the 1st Amendment protects unpopular speech?
