THE NEXT AOL!!??

Pla.net America, Inc.

Symbol: PNTC

Price:  3


"Pla.net may in the mid to long term go as high as $15-20 
per share based on projected EPS and a book value of $11.64",
an Internet analyst states.

Pla.net's (LAW(tm)) incorporates a Lotus Domino platform hosted by
the IBM Global Network.  The result is a level of speed, 
reliability and security not easily matched in the online world.

Pla.net is ahead of schedule for their North America-wide launch
on September 14th.  On September 14th,  Pla.net will be ready to 
light up North America with 62 sites activated, covering every 
state capital, plus Washington D.C. and Ottawa Canada.

Pla.net's Intranet system is designed to capitalize on the fact 
that 90% of commerce is done locally.  The Company plans on 
selling over 325 sites in the U. S. over a 3-year period.  The 
offering price on each site sold gives the Company $500,000,  per 
site, in the initial phase of development. 

R.J. Prichard & Associates has determined that the IP (Pla.net's 
Intranet solution software) is valued at over $65,000,000 as of 
August 1,  1998.  This valuation is a significant increase from the 
previous Valuation of the "Smart Community(tm) Software"  dated 
November 18,  1994 and updated on December 21,  1995.  At the time 
the Valuation came in at 6 million and 8 million respectively.

This analyst believes, and we quote, "Pla.net is the only Internet
stock currently trading at 25% of its book value".  "With a market 
cap of 17 million and a book value of 65 million Pla.net is poised 
to break out at or around $5.00 per share",  he adds.
