ENCRYPTION BREAKTHROUGH ANNOUNCED TODAY
August 24, 1998

     According to the Financial Times a new "unbreakable" encryption
technology, called the "Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem," will be annouced today
by mathematicians from the International Federal Institute of Technology
which supposedly will thwart even the most aggressive Internet hackers.
They claim to have created the first "unbreakable protection" which would
reportedly be a breakthrough that could ensure the security of electronic
commerce. The Financial Times said, "The breakthrough comes amid growing
anxiety about the vulnerability of Internet transactions since the 
discovery by researchers earlier this year of a new way to break through
even the strongest encryption systems."
