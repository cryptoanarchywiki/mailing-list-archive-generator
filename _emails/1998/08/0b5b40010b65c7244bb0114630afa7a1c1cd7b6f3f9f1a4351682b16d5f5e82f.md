Who would have guessed that a journalist would so grievously misrepresent
the claims of a soberly presented scholarly report? The title of the
technical paper is: "A Practical Public Key Cryptosystem Provably Secure
against Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext Attack". The only new claim is security
against a chosen ciphertext attack, not "unbreakable". The specific
internet angle is that an attacker might have access to a "decryption
oracle" due to the nature of high volume anonymous transactions. If one
could slip through a few million adaptively chosen ciphertexts, current
systems could leak enough information to compromise themselves. The
reported results are for a new proposed system that is not vulnerable to
this sort of attack.
