How many u-boat sinkings can be DIRECTLY related to a ciphered messages
decoded by the Allies?

My impression is that the crypto-stuff was mostly self-inflating PR done
for business reasons by the 'intelligence' agencies.  

Hedgehogs, hf/df, sonar, radar, and visual sightings played the major
role, was my impression.

However, it looks like some REAL DAMAGE was done using crypto.

  Iraq Welcomes First Iran Pilgrims Since War

  Families Heading to Muslim Shrines

  By Mariam Sami
  The Associated Press

     AL-MUNTHERIYA, Iraq -  Iranian pilgrims carrying red plastic roses
   entered Iraq on Saturday, the first such border crossing since the
two states
   declared war on each other 18 years ago. ...

    Mehrangiz Terhani, a 55-year-old house-wife who lost a son and a
  brother during the war,  was weeping so hard she had trouble speaking.

    "We have to forget the past," she said.  "I am happy and honored to
  go to a place that I've been waiting to visit for a long time."

I am not reading e-mail.
