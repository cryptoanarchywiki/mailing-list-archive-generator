This email message gives you important information about using
this list - please save it for future reference.


Sending mail to the list
========================

To send a message to all fishroute list members, use a message
with the following form (the email address is case insensitive):

 --------------------------------------------------------------
       From: Brian Dorricott <brian@net-shopper.co.uk>
         To: fishroute@fishroute.com
    Subject: PROBLEM WITH LOADING PRODUCT

    Can anybody help me unzip my file?
 --------------------------------------------------------------


Leaving the list
================

To stop receiving messages from fishroute you will need to send
a message to the list manager called "fishlist@fishroute.com" with
a command to remove you from the list.  The list manager controls
who belongs to the list.  For example:

 --------------------------------------------------------------
       From: Brian Dorricott <brian@net-shopper.co.uk>
         To: fishlist@fishroute.com
    Subject: <not needed>

    leave fishroute
 --------------------------------------------------------------

If you receive a message saying you are not a member but you are still
getting messages, you could be subscribed as a different email address.
In one of the errant messages, check for the "X-ListMember:" clause in
the header of the message.  It will have the form:

    X-listMember: brian@abc.co.uk [fishroute@fishroute.com]

which means that this message was from the list called "fishroute"
and sent to the email address "brian@abc.co.uk".  You can now leave the
list by sending the message:

 --------------------------------------------------------------
       From: Brian Dorricott <brian@net-shopper.co.uk>
         To: fishlist@fishroute.com
    Subject: <not needed>

    leave fishroute brian@abc.co.uk
 --------------------------------------------------------------


Requesting digests
==================

Instead of getting each message from the list seperately, you may ask
the list server to send you a compendium of all the messages that were
sent that day.  To do this, send a message to the list server with the
command "DIGEST".  For example:

 --------------------------------------------------------------
       From: Brian Dorricott <brian@net-shopper.co.uk>
         To: fishlist@fishroute.com
    Subject: <not needed>

    digest fishroute
 --------------------------------------------------------------

The list manager will send you a confirmation message back and every
24-hours you will receive a single email message with a contents
and each message listed in it.


Requesting Files
================

This list has a set of files associated with it.  These files may
contain new software releases, frequently asked questions etc.  The
list server provides two commands to allow you to collect these file:
DIR and GET.  If you wish to obtainly a list of all the files associated
with this list, send the following message to the list manager:

 --------------------------------------------------------------
       From: Brian Dorricott <brian@net-shopper.co.uk>
         To: fishlist@fishroute.com
    Subject: <not needed>

    dir fishroute
 --------------------------------------------------------------

In return, you will get two messages.  One is a transaction
report (telling you the command was completed) and the second will be
titled "Directory for fishroute" and would have a contents like:

 --------------------------------------------------------------
    Directory for the list fishroute

      1         INML301C.ZIP  2535788 bytes
      2         INML302D.ZIP  2671264 bytes

    Directory for fishroute has 2 entries.
 --------------------------------------------------------------

Now you know the names of the files, you can request one to be sent
to you using the GET command.  Taking the example of INML301C.ZIP,
we could use the command:

 --------------------------------------------------------------
       From: Brian Dorricott <brian@net-shopper.co.uk>
         To: fishlist@fishroute.com
    Subject: <not needed>

    get fishroute inml301c.zip
 --------------------------------------------------------------

Again, you will get two messages - the transaction report and a
message containing the MIME encoded file (or the file if it is a text
file).


Where to report problems
========================

Should you still have any problems or questions, please email
root@fishroute.com who will be happy to help.
