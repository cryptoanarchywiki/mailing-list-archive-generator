The figures are probably correct, but your
interpretation is faulty.

These days, US passports are good for 10
years. Thus, about 1/4 of the US population
has one. To Europeans this may sound like an
astonishingly low figure, but it's a big 
country, and a US citizen can visit Mexico 
and Canada without one.

The duration has been rising - my first passport,
issued in 1965, was good for only two years. This
was later bumped to 5, and then to 10. Even so, at
one time I had to visit an embassy to get extra
pages for visa stamps stapled in.
