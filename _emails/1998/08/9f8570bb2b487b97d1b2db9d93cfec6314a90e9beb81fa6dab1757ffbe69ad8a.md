Dear Kryz
 

Thank you for your response.
 
We apologise profusely for any inconvenience

transferred and sent that was not intended.  We have  rectified this 
fault, and no  transmissions apart from the original ONE (1)  have 
been sent,although some servers may relay messages - again we apologise, but it 
is now out of our control. 
 
We have removed your name from ALL files, as you 
requested.
 
Regards
