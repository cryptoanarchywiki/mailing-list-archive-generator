America is the only country that requires me to be anally violated by one of their official queens as a condition of entry into a country I'm a 
citizen of. In my view, Americans were fooled into trading their freedom for a piece of paper that everyone roundly ignores. Namely, the Bill of 
Rights. 

We should've known America was not a free country when they kept repeating that it was all the time. America is actually a land of intolerant, 
bigoted people who can't wait to kill their neighbors. While all the time proclaiming themselves to be the most moral and free people in the 
universe.

Don't bother suggesting that I 'Love it or Leave It'. I already have.
