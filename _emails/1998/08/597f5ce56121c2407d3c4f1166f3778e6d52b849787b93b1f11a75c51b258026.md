Outlook 98 Updated Security Patch
=================================

Microsoft has made an updated patch available for Microsoft Outlook 98 that
protects customers against a potential vulnerability involving file
attachments with extremely long file names as well a variant found during
continued testing.

The original vulnerability was caused by improper handling of file
attachments with very long filenames in Outlook 98. As part of our on-going
security review, we discovered a variant of this vulnerability, which this
updated patch addresses. Microsoft strongly recommends that all users
download the updated patch to be protected against these vulnerabilities.

For information about how to obtain the updated security patch see
