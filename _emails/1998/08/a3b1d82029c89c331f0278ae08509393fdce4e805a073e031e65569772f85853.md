Thank you for asking, R /\ D G /\ \/\/ D!

The best way to obtain tons of free stuff is called the "smash and grab"
technique. It needs to be modified, however. First, not many people know
that the police will actually help you load this free stuff into your
rented moving truck if you only call and ask. Make sure you tell them
exactly where you will be and exactly what time you'll be there, or they
won't be able to help! 

The police are really busy people, though, so you need to make their job
as easy as possible. A few minutes before they get there, break the front
window of the store and begin loading stuff yourself. 

This works! Really! I swear!

Oh, you should upgrade to 32-bit AOL as soon as possible. Reports indicate
that it increases AOLers' I.Q. points to an acceptable level.
