no.... I don't think that is what is being asked here, read the message
again and you will see that he is asking for getting news not being news
(even though I would love it if aolers would become news in the worst way),
so I suggest that instead he should do this:
1.) go to his mailbox or PO box
2.) open up his computer
3.) carefully insert mail in any possible cavity (in computer stones for
brain)
4.) and now proceed with prior suggestion or
5.) ensure computer is plugged in (wall socket, you know... socket connected
to power grid, grid connected to generator... etc)
6.) pour water or other suitably conductive liquid on whole mess
7.) repeat all steps as often as necessary for enlightenment to be achieved
 This might not get the poster closer to knowledge as far as news is
concerned but it should definitely provide us with a chuckle or two.
