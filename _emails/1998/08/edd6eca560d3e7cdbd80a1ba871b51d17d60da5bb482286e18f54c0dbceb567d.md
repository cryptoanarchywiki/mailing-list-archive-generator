Ha! Ha! Ha!

I can say anything I want about you guys and you won't know who I am,
because I am using an AnonymousRemailer (TM).
How does it feel to have your own CypherPunksTechnology turned against
you, eh?
And there's nothing you can do about it, because you don't know who I
am...

Hell, I can even badmouth the remailer operators, while using their own 
systems to send out my email badmouthing them, eh?
I mean, these RemailerOperators are really stupid lamers, eh? I mean,
they
can't even get their messages to come out in the same order that they
came in by...
  Dumb, eh? Some of the test messages I sent to myself came back in a
different order from that what I sent them in. I guess these guys don't
know much about computers, eh?
  And those names, 'Anonymous' and 'Nobody', aren't fooling AnyBody,
because the minute you see them, you *know* that the message is
from a remailer.  Dumb, eh?

  Well, I just thought I'd let you guys know how stupid you are and how
you'll never know who I am, or how to find me, because I am cutting the
edge off of computer technology.

p.s. - It's a damn good thing you can't find me, neither, because my
     new email account is on a system that is so straight that my
     email is automatically scanned for BadWords before being sent
     out, and I have to either use misspelled BadWords like Phuck,
     BadWords which aren't in the BadWordDictionary, like DickWadd,
     or send the chapters of SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY DRUGS!!! to
     the CypherPunks Disturbed Male LISP couched and potatoed in
     ConvectionalEncraption.
