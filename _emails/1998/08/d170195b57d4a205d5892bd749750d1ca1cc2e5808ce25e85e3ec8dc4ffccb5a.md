Problem:

There is problem with free speech in the USA: 
Judge Gwin of the Federal District Court of the Northern District of Ohio
has recently held that software is not protected by the First Amendment
because it is a ``functional device'' like a telephone circuit. 

Demonstration that C source is speech:
I made a program that translates C-source for Blowfish cryptographic
algorithm to English.

There exist process named "Blowfish_encipher". Process should takes these
things as input: location of Ronald code named "xl" liking coconuts and
