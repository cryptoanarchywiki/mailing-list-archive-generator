Declan (of fight-censorship/politech fame), Solveig (of those wacky
libertarians at the Cato Institute), and John (a reported maverick who
cracks codes) invite you to a San Francisco social dinner for
cypherpunks, politechnicals, and related species.  Declan and Solveig
are visiting SF briefly, and want to stir some of the locals out to a
watering hole.

We've reserved a room at a good Thai restaurant, full of sunken tables
and beautiful carved wood.  Please RSVP to Declan at <declan@well.com>
if you think you're coming; this will help us let the restaurant know
what to expect.  But if on Friday night you end up wanting to come,
come anyway, whether or not you RSVP'd.

The restaurant is:

	Khan Toke Thai Restaurant
	5937 Geary Blvd (at 24th Avenue).
	San Francisco, CA
	+1 415 668 6654
	Friday, 21 August 01998, 6:00PM

It's in the Richmond district of SF, out toward the ocean and north.
>From Marin, cross the bridge and take the first exit south toward
19th Avenue, which puts you on Park Presidio Ave.  Turn right on Geary
and go to 24th.  Park in the neighborhood.

>From I-280, take 19th Avenue, follow it north through the city and
through Golden Gate Park.  When you exit the park, you'll be on Park
Presidio Ave.  You can't turn left anywhere along there, so pass
Geary, and at the next block (Clement), take three rights instead.
Head west on Geary to 24th Avenue.

>From US-101 or I-80, get to SF and take the North 101 branch of the
freeway.  Take the Van Ness Avenue exit, go right at the bottom, snake
leftish across Mission and Market Streets, and you'll be going north
on Van Ness.  In about ten blocks, take a left on Geary.  Follow it
all the way to 24th Avenue.

>On transit, take the 38 Geary bus.  You can catch it at the BART
Montgomery station, or at the Transbay Terminal.

See you there!

	John
