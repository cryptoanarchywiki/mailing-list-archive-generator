Oh, man! That's what I want to know! How do _you_ get off
this mailing list? The question of the day, isn't it? Anyone
who uses "cyber" in near proximity to "punks" is automatically
disqualified from being on this list. So how did you slip in
here? You're here, but unfortunately getting off/out is not
so easy. I could suggest that you withdraw all your savings
and buy a clue, but that would obviously be futile in your
case.

You should probably contemplate your navel and how you got 
_onto_ the list, for oh, say, three hours. If enlightenment 
doesn't come, you might try eating a handful of castor beans. 
I've heard that aids digestion. Not yours, of course, but it
will no doubt ease the pains of the rest of the list
members.

If you're still troubled by list membership after that, you
might try the old tried and true solution for undesired list
problems: shoot yourself in the head.

If that doesn't work, try a larger caliber.

If that doesn't work, try loading the gun first.
