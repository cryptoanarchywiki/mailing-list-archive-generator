Yes but should this "standard" be enforced by law? Last time I looked
there was no Constitutional right not to be offended. There is a very
strong Constitutional right to freedom of speech and the courts have long
ruled that it is not just popular speech that is protected.

IMHO, this whole matter is an internal company matter. The courts and
politicians should have no say in it.
