****************************************************

      Special Offer for Web Hosting Owners

We at Cyber Media offer you what you may currently be missing from
your current web hosting company.  Things such as being able to get a
live human on the phone if you need help, or having all the services
you need to be successful (Shopping cart, secure server, etc).

We are emailing you because you have a web site and we are having our
best web hosting special ever.  April is slow for many service related
companies, we are no exception, so the only way we can get a lot of
new customers in April is to have a special that is so good that
nobody in their right mind could pass it up. 

And that is what we are trying to do.  We are hoping to offer you so
much that you can not possibly reject our offer and feel good about
doing so.

We have one of the most powerful web hosting services on the Internet.

* 100 Megabytes of storage space
* Front Page Extensions
* True virtual hosting (http://www.yourcompany.com/)
  Every customer has their own IP Address which means your
  web site will work with ALL browsers and not just the latest
  ones!
* 30 Email POP Accounts (Included FREE)
* Unlimited Email Aliases
* Unlimited Autoresponders
* Secure Server (Other sites charge for this, TOTALLY free with us
  and EASY to use too!)
* Shopping Cart Secure Online Ordering (Great for Catalogs!)
* Plug n Play CGI Scripts (Counters, Guestbooks, Form Scripts, 
  Discussion boards, and many more)
* Use your OWN CGI Scripts!
* Anonymous FTP sites
* FTP and Telnet Access
* Real Audio, Real Video, Vivo, Quicktime, True Speach and much more!
* Only 150 Customers per Web Server! Some of our competitors place
  250 to 500 customers on one server and it SLOWS everyone down.
* Best of all - 24 Hour Phone and Email Support!

All of the above plus more for only $40 per month. NO SETUP FEE!

Want to save more?

SPECIAL BONUS OFFER

Our yearly web hosting price is only $300 which breaks down to only
$25 per month! (Same price many of our competitors are selling their
ENTRY LEVEL accounts at!)  And for the first time ever, for those who
sign up yearly we are including a 200 Site Web Promotion (A $150 Value
Absolutely FREE!) See http://www.promotenow.com/ for more details.

And like always, everything we offer comes with a 30 Day 100% Money
Back Guarantee.  If you are not happy with our services, for whatever
reason, we will refund 100% of your money, every penny.

If you are still not convinced, we are doing something we have NEVER
done before and probably will never do again.  If you sign up for the
year, at only $300, we will give you an extra month ABSOLUTELY FREE! 
(This breaks down to just $23 per month!)

If you haven't made up your mind yet, or are skeptical, please
give us a call.  You can virtually always reach a human on the
other end, and if not we always return calls within the hour.  (Even
on most weekends!)  Call us toll free at (888) 260-6333 to discuss
your needs and find out how we can definately help you reach your
goals.

Testimonials

"Just wanted to thank you for all your help in getting the Lincoln
Center for the Performing Arts web site up and running.  Cyber Media
has been prompt - handling all calls and e-mails within 24 hours, and
going above and beyond the call of duty to be sure everything was
working properly. The staff has been extremely courteous, knowledgable
and professional.  We look forward to a mutually and prosperous
business relationship!"

"Since I've been with Cyber Media, I have gone from playing with
the Internet with inadequate tools, to actually working with the
proper tools provided by Cyber Media (Shopping cart, autoresponders,
email addresses, and faster servers).  I have also noticed that the
speed of their servers is much faster and the quality of the support
improved immensely.  I used to be with Webcom and could never reach
anyone on the phone, and rarely had my calls returned.  I was raised
in an era where customer support was important, it is to me, and you
are the first company I've worked with on the Internet who has not
only met my expectations but totally surpassed them!  Thank you
again."

"I have been with Cyber Media for the last 3 years and they have
always been there when I've had a question, and have quickly resolved
any problems that I have had.  I constantly recommend them to my
customers and would be happy to talk to anyone who is skeptical.  Give
me a call at 912-475-4682."
