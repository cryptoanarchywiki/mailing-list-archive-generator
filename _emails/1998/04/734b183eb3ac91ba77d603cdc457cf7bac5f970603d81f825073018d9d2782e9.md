  Hi, my name is Chris Kuszmaul. I am a contractor at NASA
Ames research center. I feel it would be valuable for the general
scientific community to be aware of some upcoming classes 
designed to educate scientists here regarding what they may and
may not write on the internet, or any public forum.
-------------------- begin excerpt --------------------
NASA has begun responding to recent new legislation and regulations
regarding the export of information or material with potential use as a
weapon of mass destruction or international business competitiveness
advantage. All personnel creating information, equipment or material
falling within this category are now responsible to control its transfer
according to regulations.  NASA has created an Export Control
Administrator at each Center responsible to implement a program which
provides for the review, classification and approval (or disapproval) of
the export of material or information which may be subject to
limitations.

The Center has arranged for the outreach program offices of the U.S.
Customs and the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA), U.S. Department
of Commerce, to conduct a brief class on their Agency's regulatory
requirements in partial fulfilment of this required training. Everyone
is welcome to attend, but this is a mandatory briefing for researchers,
engineers and equipment developers. This session will deal with the
enforcement of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), issues of
the Commerce Control List (CCL), and Export Classification Control
Number (ECCN). This particular session covers the regulatory requirement
for the authors of scientific, technical materials and software
developers. Anyone who generates and develops such materials, or sends
NASA commodities overseas must attend this session.  These specifically
include NRC, Ames Associates, grant recipients, students, IPA's,
contractors, civil service employees and all others who publish on
behalf of NASA. The EAR, CCL, ECCN are important in completing block III
of the Document Availability Authorization (DAA)(Form 1676).

Each session will be approximately 15-20 minutes.  A question and answer
session will follow after the talk.

The dates, time, and location are indicated below. Attendance at one
session is sufficient to fulfill the regulatory requirements.

                      Dates           Time
    Location

    May 7, 1998      10 am      Bldg. 213, Rm 261

....

---------------------------------------

  As the text above says, everybody is welcome to attend.
