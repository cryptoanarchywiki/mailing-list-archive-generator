This morning I was going through my logs and I saw an anonymous ftp
connection to my machine, which ordinarily I wouldn't care about.. I
distribute my RSA keys from this machine.. but the connection was
from corvette.bxa.doc.gov, so I looked further at the FTP commands
issued and it looks like a bot. 

Several instances of "SIZE", even on directory names; it recursed into
the tree got some smaller files and that was it. 

So, I went sniffing. www.bxa.doc.gov:

   The Bureau of Export Administration enhances the nation's security and
   its economic prosperity by controlling exports for national security,
     foreign policy, and short supply reasons. We administer the Export
     Administration Act by developing export control policies, issuing
   export licenses, and prosecuting violators. "

A quick web search for corvette.bxa.doc.gov brought up several "web
statistics pages" .. it crawls all over the place. It seems as if it
targets technical sites. 

I just thought you guys might like to hear about it. If anyone needs
anymore info, or wants the sections from my logs just let me know.
