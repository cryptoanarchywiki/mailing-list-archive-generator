The General Accounting Office published today its April 9 
report to Congress, "Combating Terrorism: Threat and Risk 
Assessments Can Help Prioritize and Target Program 
Investments." 

It reviews the status of the domestic preparedness program, 
and recommends that for continued funding cities be required 
to perform threat and risk assessments.

There's interesting discussion about the Feds sharing 
sensitive intelligence with locals. And, FEMA questions if it
will be legal to require cities to perform the assessments.

The report is available from GAO in PDF format:
