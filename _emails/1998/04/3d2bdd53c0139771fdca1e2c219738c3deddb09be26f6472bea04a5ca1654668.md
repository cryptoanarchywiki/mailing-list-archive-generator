thanks all for the quick replies, for my needs a point to point
connection is fine.

i've looked at a few things out there (netfortress, some bay routers)
but they are all very slow, i'm looking for a wire speed implementation
(100-1000Mb/s) is there anything out there in this arena? or do i have
to make my own <g>.  if i were to embark on building my own is there any
body of work out there that would help me get a jump start? i have the
LAN protocol knowledge but my crypto knowledge is limited to what i've
read in Schneier.

thanks,

-stuart  

ps. i should now be on the lists, but if you could cc replies to me i'd
appreciate it
