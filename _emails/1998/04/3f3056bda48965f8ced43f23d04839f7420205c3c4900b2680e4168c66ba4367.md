Indeed.  So that we can prevent this from happening again, I'll 
reveal my deadly hacker tools.  Alta Vista and Beer.

If that weren't enough, I wasn't even looking for a .mil site. I was
looking for pgp tips.   If you try 
http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&stq=10&what=web&kl=XX&q=
%2Bpgp+%2Btips+%2B.mil+bragg+fort&navig90.x=10&navig90.y=5
you'll find that Alta Vista's "Scooter" robot is the troublemaker.
As to his or her motives, you'll have to search for yourself.

As far as "choosing a source that doesn't have anything to gain (or lose) by
misrepresenting the facts", well, damn, if that doesn't seem to
be the pot calling the kettle black.

At least you replied from a .mil address this time, so I don't feel I'm
replying solely to some USO hack.

Why is the CIA is so full of spies?
