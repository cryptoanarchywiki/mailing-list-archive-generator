This is true. And helpful to file for future reference. Data show
that Tim's thoughts are not what they appear to be in text.

The needle -- yes, the mind-reading machine's analog -- jumps
all the way to left, Bizarre Humor, whenever no mercy emissions
emanate from the hilltop bastion's outgoing array.

Only unclues take Tim's deadpan assays for deadshot intent.
Those black talons are black jokes, Bob, laugh. You never been
shot at to keep you dancing? Don't stop, though, or the fun ends.
