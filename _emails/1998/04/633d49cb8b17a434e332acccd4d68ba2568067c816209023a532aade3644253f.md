Duncan Campbell has provided his 1988 article on
the NSA ECHELON global surveillance system,
one of the earliest accounts:

   http://jya.com/echelon-dc.htm

Duncan, who was hounded in court for years by the 
UK gov for allegedly revealing official secrets, provided 
substantial  support to James Bamford for "The Puzzle 
Palace." 

He was interviewed about ECHELON on French TV
yesterday. See his most informative Web site for 
investigative reporting:
