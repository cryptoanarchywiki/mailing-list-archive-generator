Greetings and thanks for using CNN Custom News, the most
complete personalized news service on the Web.  We want to let
you know about some of the exciting improvements that we've
made to the site.  If you haven't visited the service recently,
be sure to check out these latest upgrades at:

http://CNN.com/CustomNews

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>*<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
CNN CUSTOM NEWS HAS 2000 NEW CATEGORIES and NEW SOURCES
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>*<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

News is not "personalized" unless you can specifically target
your interests. Since June 4th, 1997, we've added nearly 2,000
categories to CNN Custom News, including a variety of
space-related subjects, more country-specific international
categories and additional entertainment articles.  Our total
number of categories now numbers more than 2,200!

And don't forget that CNN Custom News has over 100 information
sources from which to draw.  Just this week, the Environmental
News Network has begun supplying Custom News with stories to
further expand your perspective on the news.  Now go in-depth,
no matter where your area of interest lies!


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>*<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
ALL YOUR TEAMS' SCORES ARE CONVENIENTLY ON ONE PAGE
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>*<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Do you follow Minor League Baseball?  How about Arena Football?
Custom News will keep you up-to-date with the news and scores
from all of your favorite teams whether they are college, major
or minor league.

If soccer is your thing, you won't be left out.  CNN Custom News
enables you to keep track of soccer country by country.  You can
also follow diverse sports such as cricket, rugby or Formula One
racing, all from your personalized sports page.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>*<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
CNN CUSTOM NEWS IS FASTER - 75 TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>*<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

As a result of our technical partnership with Oracle, over 75
software and design improvements have been implemented in our
computer server farm during the past eight months to improve
Custom News' performance. We know that Custom News saves you
time and we're striving to make your experience as fast and
reliable as possible.  Try us again and see the difference.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>*<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
GO THROUGH YOUR DAY WITH A SMILE - DON'T MISS 'ALT'
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>*<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

The CNN Custom News Team has created a new section called "alt".
Here you'll find a selection of comics, horoscopes, games and
off-key topics such as UFOs and pets.  There is no better way to
pick up your day!


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>*<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
CNN CUSTOM NEWS TIP:  REMOVING THE JAVA TICKER
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>*<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

The CNN News Stream scrolling Java ticker provides a convenient
way to view your personalized news headlines, sports scores and
stock prices.  But if you would like your Custom News pages to
load more quickly, you can remove the CNN News Stream ticker.
Simply click on the "Change Custom Profile" button, scroll to
the bottom of the page and click on the CNN News Stream option.
Select "none" for the ticker location, then "save and exit."
You'll be on your way to a faster loading homepage!


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>*<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
WHAT IF I'VE FORGOTTEN MY PASSWORD?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>*<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
If you have not used the service in a while or are on a new
computer, you may need to enter your user name and password.
If you can remember your user name, but forgot your password,
the system will prompt you with the reminder message you
created at the time of registration. The reminder will appear
directly above your login name.

If you have forgotten both your user name and password, simply
open a new account with our QuickStart Profile option.  It's
fast and easy to start using CNN Custom News again!


Thanks for your time.  If you haven't already, come by
CNN.com/CustomNews and check out the improved Custom News
service.

Sincerely,

The CNN Custom News Team
