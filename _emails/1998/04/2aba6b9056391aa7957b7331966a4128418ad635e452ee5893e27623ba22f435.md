The USAF's 22-volume 1996 investigation of the Ron Brown
plane crash supposedly offers in Volume 2 one of the best 
unclassified recent accounts of High Intensity Radio Frequency 
(HIRF) and electromagnetic interference (EMI). 

We've been told that the report's available only in hardcopy 
from the Air Force -- a few copies were publically released
in June 1996 at a Pentagon press conference. We'd like to 
get a copy of Volume 2 to scan the HIRF and EMI parts but 
cannot locate the proper office for a request -- www.af.mil 
does not appear to offer the report.

We'd appreciate hearing from anyone who might have 
access to Volume 2 and would be willing to loan or know 
how we can get it.

State's Jamie Rubin yesterday confirmed Russia's SIGINT
operation at Lourdes, Cuba but declined comment on the US 
counterpart. Dave Emery wrote about this awhile back:

Someday we might learn what the US military knows about 
EMI attacks on critical infrastructure, planes, ships, trains and 
limos -- theirs and ours.
