FLAW FOUND IN DIGITAL WIRELESS PHONE SYSTEM

http://www.wow-com.com/professional/news
Computer security engineers say they have discovered a weakness 
in GSM, the most widely used digital cellular phone technology in 
the world. Some are worried that the flaw could eventually be exploited 
to enable hackers to get free service by pretending to be legitimate
subscribers. A software developer and two graduate students say 

they can obtain important security information from GSM cellular 
phones. Click above link for the Cellular Telecommunications 
Industry Association's reaction to this announcement.

===================================================
FROST & SULLIVAN STUDY -- LOCAL VOICE SERVICES 
THROWN OPEN BY TELECOM ACT OF 1996

http://www.wow-com.com/results/professional/
Designed to create a competitive environment, the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996 was an invitation to companies 
from different market segments to vie for the same market share
in the public local wireline and wireless voice services market.  The
question now is, how well has it worked?   According to new 
strategic research from Frost & Sullivan U.S. Markets for Public 
Local Wireline and Wireless Voice Services, the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996 has created the most significant
business opportunity since the long distance market was opened for
true competition 13 years ago.  Many companies are entering the 
local wireline services market such as interexchange carriers (IXCs),
competitive access providers (CAPs), cable TV service providers 
(CATV) and utility companies, as well as wireless voice service 
providers such as cellular carriers, Personal Communications Service
(PCS) providers and wireless local loop voice service providers.

===================================================
WINSTAR LAUNCHES FIXED WIRELESS MULTIPOINT
