I make a point of checking the individuals and companies involved in
various enterprises claiming to be the paranoid's best friend, as well
as checking their links and assorted tentacles.
The first thing I noticed about veil's anonymity site was that they don't
seem very proud of who they are and their company's background, since
they don't provide any information of that nature.
Combining that fact with the fact that they seem to be giving out 
blatantly false information regarding the anonymity of their users,
I would assume that their purpose is far from what they claim.
