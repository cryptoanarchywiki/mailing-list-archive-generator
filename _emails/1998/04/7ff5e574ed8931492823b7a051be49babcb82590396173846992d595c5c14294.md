                    WANTED / DEAD OR ALIVE!


I will pay a CA$H REWARD for the capture of the Armed Thugs who broke
into my Bienfait residence and stole a variety of computer items,
including a computer, computer peripherals and personal documents.

The CA$H REWARD will be also be paid if those recovering the stolen
items are forced to engage in actions of self-defense, resulting in the
death of the criminals.

Witnesses report that the perpetrators of the crime were dressed to
resemble members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, were heavily
armed, and appeared willing to violently attack anyone interfering with
their criminal activity. Their audacity in perpetrating the crime in
broad daylight indicates that they are professional criminals with
little regard for the consequences of their actions.

Suggestions that those of  Native Ancestry would 'Shoot first, and ask
questions later.' should probably be ignored, since it is unlikely that
common criminals harbor the same propensity for  racial violence that is
exhibited by legitimate members of the RCMP.

Any person or persons engaging in the capture of the criminals and the
recovery of the stolen property should take care to avoid violating the
legal or  Charter Rights of the criminals, unless said person or persons
are representatives of an officially recognized law enforcement agency.
