Perhaps you didn't read the 411 for the PGP-Mailing-List. I don't recall
it saying "Ask unrelated questions if your a newbie." IMO anyone
interested in "2600" groups can find 411 all over the www.
also there are alt.2600 newsgroups, as well as other places. I personally
wouldn't even mind if you kept it off the list and asked if I knew what
2600 is, but trying to "teach" ppl what you "think" 2600 is.. has no place
on this mailing list.

I have no interest in starting a flame, you have embarrased yourself well
enough.

If I simply wrote the 2600 faq (which I didnt) it would have bettered
society, because idiots would have an idea what it is.

Well, obviously you stumbled upon a keyboard as well, prematurely perhaps.

I'm not trying to "scare you away". (you'd know if I was "trying").

I'll help you with anything I can, off-list. In the meantime, read.

Pretending you have an idea on what 2600 is not related to security.
(Although the 2600 group irnoically does).

Perhaps if you reply off-list or try stop trying to pull your head out of
toilet, I'll leave you alone.
