It is even easier to track in real-time if one has prior information
in regard to the possessession of such 'anonymous' instruments, either
through in-place informants on either end (or both ends) of the
transaction.

  Mr. May is astute enough to recognize that law enforcement agencies
are fully capable of reading (or writing) the same guerrila-outlaw
how-to books and manuals available to would-be anonymous activists, and
that it is dangerous for an individual to fail to use their own wit
and wisdom to add additional layers of protection and deception to
guerilla methods commonly championed.
  e.g. - a 'known plaintext' becomes one-step deeper when translated
into an unfamiliar language.

  One should be careful about insulting people named 'Anonymous', since
we come from such a large family...

  Very true, but I was thinking more in terms of the pre-existing
compromise of the tools of anonymity which will be offered/marketed
to the masses.
  e.g. - Decades ago, after picking up a book order from Loompmatics
which I had sent to a cold-address (USPS), I shortly thereafter watched
in amusement as border-guards tore my vehicle apart looking for material
that they theoretically were not supposed to know I had taken possession
of, not knowing that my 'unreasonable' paranoia had resulted in my 
making a 'test run' before crossing the border with them.

  There are many more remailers in existence than is readily apparent.
The Winsock remailer software, for instance, has been modified to
allow 'clustered' remailers to exist on a single server, wherein a
number of individuals can channel their email to a separate in-house
remailer designed to give them an outgoing consistent persona that
is not traceable to their incoming message through ordinary man-in-
the-middle tracking.
