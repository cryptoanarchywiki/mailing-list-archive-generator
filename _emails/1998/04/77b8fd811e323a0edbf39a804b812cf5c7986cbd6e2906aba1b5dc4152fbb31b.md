The Navy's Onion Routing project (www.onion-router.net) actual makes 
reference to anonymous cell phone networks by using encrypted proxies 
(Onions).  The current implementation is IP based, but the briefing 
documents refer to any public networks including pager and cell networks.

>>On cell "remailers": Why resend the cell signal?  Why not instead set up a

>>non-users alike?  As long as you use the call resender for all of your
