Federal Computer Week, April 6, 1998:

NSA report details risks of key-recovery technology

The National Security Agency has prepared a report that may 
be the first federal government documentation of the potential 
risks posed by the encryption technology that has been at the 
center of a raging debate between the Clinton administration 
and industry.

The report, "Threat and Vulnerability Model for Key Recovery," 
pointed out that certain law enforcement agents and officials 
operating key-recovery centers could pose the greatest threat 
to a key-recovery system -- and to the users' data, which is 
encrypted by the system -- if proper security mechanisms were 
not in place.

Any leads on getting a copy of the NSA report would be
appreciated.
