excerpt:

FBI agents working the Starr probe zeroed in on PARCEL PLUS in early
February, it has been learned. 

Agents conducted interviews and spent hours with the store's computer. 

"They were digging around in the computer's guts," a store source explains,
"below DOS." 

STARR's team interviewed the store's owner and two other employees -- with one
employee taking a trip down to Starr's office for questioning. 

Investigators have left nothing to chance: subpoenaing detailed information
from PARCEL PLUS' local Internet provider and digging up all of the store's
phone records via BELL ATLANTIC.
