Corporate America - The Great Life...

..or not! 
Stop and think a minute about your current career.  Are you appreciated?
Are you happy with your present situation?  Can you take a month off and 
increase your salary while on vacation? Do you see yourself in the same 
position 5 years from now?  What about 5 years from that?

If you want more out of life than "Corporate America" can provide, please 
read on.  Are you completely satisfied with the financial status of your 
life? Are you able to STOP working and still earn the kind of money you 
want to?  If so, then delete this message! However, if you'd like to learn 
how to achieve the results you're looking for, keep reading!

Have you ever taken the time to do some serious soul-searching?  Have you 
ever thought about your future and what you really want to do with your 
life?  Over the last several months, I have done just that.  And in doing 
so, I've come to the conclusion that I don't want to be in "Corporate 
America" working for someone else who doesn't appreciate my efforts for 
the rest of my life. I want to be rewarded for my efforts and my work. I
want to have the control and be in business for myself! 

Since I couldn't afford to just walk away from my present career until I 
replaced my income, I started researching businesses that would offer me 
the flexibility to start part-time without interfering with my present job.  
After considerable time researching different businesses, I finally chose 
one that impresses me very much.  There's great potential with virtually no 
investment or risk. 

My company has recently been featured in Success Magazine, The Wall Street 
Journal, Investor's Business Daily, has been ranked in NASDAQ's top 100 
companies and was just ranked #106 in Forbes 200 best small companies in 
America. We are currently experiencing rapid growth nationally and 
internationally and our stock has grown more than 1400% since going public 
only four years ago.

I am currently expanding my team and would be interested in working with 
you directly in this extraordinary business.To obtain a brief "no obligation"
summary of this business please call toll free 1-888-834-7542.  You may also
provide your name, address and phone number at the end of the message to 
receive a free cassette outlining this timely business opportunity in more 
detail.

I look forward to working with you and helping you fulfill your dreams of 
freedom!

Enthusiastically,
Tom & Laura
