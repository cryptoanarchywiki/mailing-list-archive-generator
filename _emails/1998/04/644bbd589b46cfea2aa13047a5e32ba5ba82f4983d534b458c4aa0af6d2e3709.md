Toto's computers were seized today by RCMP and Canadian Customs.

All communications with him, past, present and future, should be 
considered compromised.

Reroute the legal information, etc., that he requested Monday to
the sonofgomez address.

The good news is...he figured out where the 'yellow wire' goes...
