While this was a parody, I did recently see a TV news segment
discussing ratings regulations on TV and the Internet.
They interviewed one parent who was quite concerned -
her daughter had her own TV in her bedroom, and there
was no way to know what she might be watching, what with
cable tv carrying all sorts of things.....
				Thanks!
