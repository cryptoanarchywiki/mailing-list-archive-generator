One can only hope that some bored cynic can perhaps generate
a parody page which expresses the truth.  And seed the 
META-CONTENT with enough k-12 keywords to snag the eyeballs.

"Hi, I'm Dorothy Lemming, and I work for the intelligence community.
We listen to your calls to your granny in the old country, 
we scan your email, we get our Canadian buddies to listen to you
and teach them how to share.
We like to know what you're saying.  Its our way of 
getting in touch with your feelings."

"Hi, my name is Louie, and I like to listen too.  We're trying
to point out all the scary monsters to your parents so they will 
let us do whatever we want.  So that we can protect you.  What's
a little privacy for safety?"

"Hi, my name is Aldrich Ames, and my job is to make sure all our
spies work for us..."
