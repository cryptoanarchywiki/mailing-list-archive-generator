 Not to sound like a first amendment basher, but if these parents are
worried about what their daughter is viewing on her own TV in the
bedroom, why don't they take it the hell out of there and have her watch
TV in the family room. The implication is that she is young enough for
them to be concerned about her impressionability. If she is that young,
isn't that simply good parenting? Seems to me like a no brainer ... but
then again, what the hell do I know .. I raised four kids (youngest 16)
who all seem to have their heads on reasonably straight and have yet to
be named in any indictments.
