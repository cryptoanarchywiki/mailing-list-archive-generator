"The policy of the Intelligence Directorate of the CIA to provide Canada
with finished analyses costing millions of dollars--even though that got
little or no information in return--was generous, but it was based on
enlightened self-interest as much as anything.
"The theory was that if Canada had the same information as the United
States, it would adopt similar policies.
"That's precisely what happened and Canada remained a firm ally, causing
little or no trouble or concern for the United States."
