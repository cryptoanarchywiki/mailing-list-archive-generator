I think you should perhaps read a little more maboy. 2600 is not an FAQ,
although, with any "group" nowadays, there is a FAQ avaliable for newbies
etc (obviously like yourself). 2600 refers to a frequency, NOT a q and a,
actually it derived from a tone that could "steal" trunk lines. They are
not "supposedly hackers and phreakers". Aso the debatable issure of exact
translation of a hacker, IMO it is anyone that has altered ANY program. 
p.s. If it wasn't for hackers, you wouldn't have the technology you have.

OH what you've read on the beloved www. I'd imagine you read an article on
a webpage full of sex ad banners as well. I don't feel that I am an
"outlawed hero" but I feel I better society in various ways.

As I've already said, you have alot more reading to do.
I agree this is not a mailinglist for anything other than PGP. And how
this thread evolved so far is by negligence.
RTFM
