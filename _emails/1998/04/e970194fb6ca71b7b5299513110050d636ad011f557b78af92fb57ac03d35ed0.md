... slavery only to yourself - who made the choice to have children in
the first place?  Once you make that choice, you're stuck with it. 
That's not a penalty, just propagation of species: you accept the
responsibility to teach your children what they need to know in order
for them to become functional adults, so they may someday do the same. 
To extend on this 'teaching process', it seems folly to assume that a
child will all-of-a-sudden turn into a thinking, reasonable adult on
their 18th birthday without a certain degree of critical thinking
ability beforehand.
