"Perhaps the most defining feature of the CypherPunks was that they strove
to 'walk their talk', as the saying was in those days. While they decried
the increasing infringement of central authority on the freedom and privacy
of the individual, which was near its zenith at that point in time, they
chose to fight for the right to be self-willed, rather than to impose their
will and beliefs on others.
"Instead of concentrating their efforts on forcing the authorities to acting
rightly, in the interests of freedom and privacy, they focused on routing
around the impositions and infringements that the governments and dark
forces of that era enacted to try to contain them.
"John Gilmore, one of the CypherPunks founders, often said, 'The InterNet
interprets censorship as damage, and routes around it.' Very Taoist." Bubba
concluded.

Jonathan spoke softly, quoting a section of the Tao Te Ching which had been
a particular favorite of his grandfathers,
"A man of Virtue performs his part,
"But a man without Virtue requires others to fulfill their obligations.
"The Tao of heaven is impartial.
"It stays with good men all the time."
