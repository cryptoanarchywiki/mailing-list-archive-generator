This is really nothing new. My understanding is that when Kelly Goen posted
the original PGP to USENET, he set the distribution to US only, or at the
very least North America only.

However, some mis-configured news machine actually exported PGP to the rest
of the world by ignoring the distribution request on those news messages.

The machine in question had a .mil domain name. :-).

Cheers,
