choice excerpts:

landmark First Amendment ruling, is whether an entity, in distributing
information in a general way, can be found to have advocated or incited
lawless action.

Appeals Court Judge J. Michael Luttig wrote in the ruling that Paladin may
be held liable because speech that aids and abets does "not enjoy the
protection of the First Amendment."
