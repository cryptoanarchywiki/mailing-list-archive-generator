    no, abortion does not serve the interests of limiting the
    "undesirables" to meet elitist population control ideas.  quite
    the opposite --the various machinations of the extremeist
    conservative [bowel] movement and depriving of abortion funds 
    has meant that abortion is available only to the haves. same
    result in U.S. foreign policy which excludes not only abortion
    services from foreign aid disbursement, but also birth control.

    so, the population of "bean pickers, niggers, and white trash"
    increases relative to the desired "white" population --rather
    dramatically --"elitist" families have negative population
    growth; several of the others have factors as high as 300%.

    personally, I am against abortion-- however, I'll be damned if
    I would deny anyone else either the right or the means to make
    that personal decision. it is not a question of morality; it is
    a fundamental right to freedom of choice unencumbered by an
    increasingly invasive federal government --the first Bitch can
    take her Global Village into her house, not mine.
