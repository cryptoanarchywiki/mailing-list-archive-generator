Dear One Nation supporter in NSW,

Qantas has banned coverage of Pauline Hanson and One Nation from inflight news.

Qantas has effectively censored Channel 9's inflight coverage of Australian
news and has, in effect, implied that there is something "distasteful" about
Mrs Hanson and her political party.

The action allegedly follows a complaint by a QANTAS staff member about
coverage of Mrs Hanson being offensive to Indonesian passengers on an
international flight.

Pauline Hanson's political adviser, Mr David Oldfield, said it was
"disgraceful, un-Australian activity asking Channel 9 to be political
censors on behalf of Qantas.

"Everything that is said publicly, people should have the right to judge for
themselves whether something matters or doesn't," he said.

"But it certainly isn't up to any airline or anyone else to decide that
legitimate
public debate isn't to be viewed."

If you feel rightfully outraged by this act of censorship by Qantas (the
Australian Airline) please contact them by email:

qantasmedia@qantas.com.au 

I would encourage you to take a moment to express how you feel about this issue.

Finally, please note Ansett have not undertaken censorship of this sort.

GWB




Scott Balson
