NOTHING from the court, DOE or EEOC today.

Good.

I loaded my boat in the back of my truck.

Fishing tomorrow and Sunday at Navajo lake.

Navajo lake is on the Colorado border.

My primary goal is to finish the digital FX.  But I need
a mental health break.

I got kick out of the moralist lecture to schneier@counterpane.com. 
http://www.jya.com/bud-avbsp.htm

I can only imagine "Bud" <bud@checkmaster.com>'s horror when 
he reads about Morales and my genocide, deficient crypto, and crooked
judge lawsuit.

But, of course, we are merely trying to promote settlement of this
UNFORTUNATE matter before something POSSIBLY serious happens.

Settlement progress is reported to our friends at http://www.wpiran.org/
and others in hope it is passed along to the interested.  

Peaceful MONETARY settlement of this UNFORTUNATE matter is clearly in
everyone's best interest.

Thoroughly enjoyed Site Secrets. http://www.jya.com/crypto.htm#site
The Real World again.

Have a good weekend all.
