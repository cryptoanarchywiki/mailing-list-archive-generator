I just don't understand how, in 1998, anyone could let Tenet get away
with a claim about key recovery like this.  Didn't anyone ask him how he
expected high-tech hackers (especially those possibly aided by foreign
intelligence agencies) to use key recovery?

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Intrusion into government computers 

	[SNIP]

	Unless the computer industry and the government find a 
	legislative compromise, the government could fall victim to 
	hackers able to hide their own actions in impenetrable 
	encryption codes. It may take a major computer-hacker 
	incident to create the political pressure needed to allow
	the government the "recovery" power to access encrypted 
	databases. 

	"There is a train wreck waiting to happen unless we deal 
	with the recovery aspect of the encryption debate," Tenet 
	said.
