So 'Nobody' (Tim May) has joined FreeGroup.  Of course, shortly after that he
revealed himself (in multiple fuckups) and he tried to cause a big ruckus, but
that's no big deal.  Actually, the alias that he joined the group under seems
to be pretty nice guy (when he's not abusing the addressing. ;-) )

So, all's well that ends well, or is it, Tim?  [BIG GRIN!]

Stan,
