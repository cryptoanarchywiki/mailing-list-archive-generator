Got an envelope size 9x1/4 x 11 7/8 in the mail today postmarked

  ALBUQUERQUE NM

  JUN 12'98

from 

  U.S. Department of Justice
  United States Attorney
  District of New Mexico
  POB 607
  Albuquerque, NM 87103

  Official Business
  Penalty for Private use $300.

My guess is about 4-7 page.  

Paper clip at lower right side.

If last letter from Mitchell is any indication of rational
behavior, then my guess that this will eclipse the former.

But I did not open it.  This is a weekend.  I have principles.

NO envelope was received from court in response to 

http://jya.com/whp052898.htm

I will fax contents of U.S. Department of Justice envelope
as soon as we open it.

We must ALL keep a good sense of humor.

A mathematician, physicist, and engineer we all asked to calculate
the volume of a red rubber ball.

The mathematician measured the diameter, then solved a triple integral
to find the volume.

The physicist submerged the red rubber ball in a vessel of water
to measure its displacement.

The engineer looked it up in his red rubber ball handbook.
