<sig> when will people learn?

Microsoft is *incapable* and *unwilling* to provide even nominal security
for it's platforms.

Several problems that exist:

Technical Ability -- Microsoft is seriously lacking in the technical
know-how when it comes to cryptology and data security.

Corporate Mentality -- Microsoft does not have the mentality needed to
produce secure products. This is a company that has historically shipped
poorly designed, bug filled products out the door. Bugs are not seen as a
problem but as an opportunity to sell upgrades. While this has done them
well in selling their overpriced GameBoys (the sheeple never cease to
disappoint me) it is *not* the environment for developing secure products.


Previous security foobars by M$:

NT C2 <---- LOL!!!

Active X <---- Who was the brain child that though *that* up?

Auto-Launch attached binaries in E-Mail <-- Can we say GoodTimes?

Crypto-API <--- Right I would *trust* that. Honest. :)

TCP/IP Stack <--- Too many flaws to list.


Why would anyone trust these simpletons to produce any type of security
product?
