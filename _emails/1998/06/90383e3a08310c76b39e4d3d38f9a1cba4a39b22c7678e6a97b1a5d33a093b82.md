The primary difference between X.509v3 vs. PGP keys is one of format, not
of function. There is nothing you can do in native PGP key format that you
can't do in X.509.

However, many companies mandate keys to be kept in X.509 format
for compatibility reasons (you can then put the key on a smartcard, etc.).
What this move will mean is that PGP will make further inroads into the
corporate world and that strong crypto will be used more widely.

Standardization is a Good Thing.
