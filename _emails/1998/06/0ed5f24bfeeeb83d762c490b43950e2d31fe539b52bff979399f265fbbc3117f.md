The woman made her choice when her legs went up in the air. Because she
does not wish to be inconvenienced by the consequences of her actions does
not give here the right to commit murder.

Bunk, their are numerous laws that tell others what they can or can not
do. It is illegal to steal, it is illegal to commit murder. The fact they
you may be stealing from someone else or trying to kill someone else does
not make it any less illegal (and immoral). Every human has basics rights;
the right to life being the cornerstone of those rights.

I think it quite acceptable for someone to incur risks while in the act of
commiting murder up to and including their own death. As far as the
practitioners of murderer for profit they are no better than the Nazi's
gassing the Jews.

Yes their is, a dead one. I suggest you talk to some "unwanted",
fatherless children and ask them if they would rather be dead (not to
mention die a quite painful and barbaric death). I think you will find
that few of them share your opinions on the matter.

<sigh> I really didn't want this to turn into an abortion debate. I was
just trying to show the hypocrisy of the "save the children" crowd.
