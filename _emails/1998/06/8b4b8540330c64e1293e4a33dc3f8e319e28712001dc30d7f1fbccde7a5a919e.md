To hell with the children!!

If we need anything in this country it is a good supply of hemp rope so
whenever one of these control freaks tries to wipe their ass with the
Constitution under the guise of "saving the children" they are immediately
dragged out by their heals and lynched on the spot!!

If they are so anxious to "save the children" why don't they ban all
automobiles? I don't have exact figures but I am sure 1,000's of children
die and 10,000's are injured every year in auto accidents. I am sure that
Detroit and the oil industry might have a few words against it not to
mention 100 million angry motorist.

And if they really want to save some children why don't they shut down the
multi-billion dollar infanticide industry known as abortion. Why are these
medical hacks allowed to do to children what they would be jailed for
doing to a dog? Perhaps because it serves nicely with the elitist goals of
population control (need to keep the number of niggers, bean pickers, and
white trash down to a controllable number) not to mention that their
pockets are well lined by the hacks.

If they were truly operating on moral principals one would think they
would go after that which causes the greatest harm to the most children.
But of course they don't. They have no more morality than a bitch in heat.
Their "save the children" bit is just a pre-emptive trump against any
opposition (how can you not be for saving children!!).
