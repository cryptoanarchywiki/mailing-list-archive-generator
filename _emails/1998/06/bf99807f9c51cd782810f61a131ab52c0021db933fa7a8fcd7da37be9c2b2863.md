G'day,

The media are once again blatantly misrepresenting the issues that Pauline
Hanson raised in parliament yesterday.

We would invite you to see for yourself a verbatim transcript of what she
said and view direct links to the ATSIC and UN home pages which confirm her
concerns on the issues raised such as the planned "formation of independent
Aboriginal states" in Australia.
 
View: http://www.gwb.com.au/un.html

Be informed! Do not believe the lies the media tell.

Please print out her speech and distribute it freely.

GWB




Scott Balson
