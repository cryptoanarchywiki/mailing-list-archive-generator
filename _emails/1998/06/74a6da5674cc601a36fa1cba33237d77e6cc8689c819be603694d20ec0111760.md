hah.. the fact that you are claiming that you are going to write a
"program" that will combine all the good /h/p/v/c apps out there and
combine them into one is simply ridiculous.. 
what you are claiming is that you are going to write a program that will
have builting crackers, sniffers, DoSes, Tone Generators, Virii creation
utils, box plans...etc. This is absolutely ridiculous...
just for the record, what would you consider the "good /h/p/v/c" apps out
there? the uberl33t winnuke.exe.. or perhaps maybe the k-rad linklooker..
it is ppl like you sho seriously make me wonder where society is headed...
