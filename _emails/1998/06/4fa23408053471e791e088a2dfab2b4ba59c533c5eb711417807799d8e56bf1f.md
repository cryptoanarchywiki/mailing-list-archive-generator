That is B$, i.e. pork barelled gold plated bullshit!  Standard Oil story was simply some 
businessmen whoring to politicians whoring to businessmen.  But what a price did we pay for 
that!

The Sherman Act is simply another appropriation of market by physical force, made morally 
acceptable by legislating it.  

When a country legalize the use of force for profits, their citizens will suffer the 
consequences sooner or later.
