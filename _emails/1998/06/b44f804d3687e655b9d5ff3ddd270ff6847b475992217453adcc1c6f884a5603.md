think it could never happen to them.  Learn how to avoid investment fraud,

BEFORE YOU INVEST - LEARN THE FACTS

Investment Evaluative Services Corporation has compiled a desktop reference
entitled "Inside the World of Investment Fraud, Scams and Deceptive
Practices".  

It is easy to read, concise and contains the investment phrases, terms, and
conditions that an investor should KNOW and AVOID!  It also contains
citations that will inform the investor of not only what investments should
be avoided, but why.  (Learn more at http://www.FraudReview-IESC.com)
 
If terms like Asset Managed Programs, Bank Debentures, High Yield/Low Risk,
Leveraged Funds, and Top 25 Banks are in your investment portfolio, you may
already be a victim of investment fraud!

If terms like Bank Guarantees of 106%, Blocked Funds Letter,  Safe Keeping
Receipt, and Trading Programs are not familiar to you, you may shortly
become a victim of investment fraud!
