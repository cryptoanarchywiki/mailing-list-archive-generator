HELLO
The following information is not meant to spam or upset anyone, that is why we include
Advertisement in the subject line to give you an option to delete before you open the
message. We are a Reliable Internet Company that does full Internet Marketing. 
Whatever your needs to market your business or product, A.I.M. can help you achieve
your success. Please do not treat this as just another piece of junk mail, we are Aimed to
your success.

A.I.M. was established in 1994 and has helped many people on the
Internet market their business and products successfully.  We do not sell random bulk
email lists, nor do we advertise Adult Sites or Chain Letters.

Right now the largest form of communication is done through the Internet, and 1998 will
be  another record breaking year.  There are over 60 million people that have Internet
access world wide, and that number continues to rise at a rate of over 40,000 per month. 
The best way to market any product or service is through the Internet, and random bulk
mail is not the way to go.  You may ask, why am I sending you this ONE piece of email;
to get my information out so that others can follow the same practices of Internet
advertising.  The Internet community would benefit from direct advertising!

Now you ask what can we offer you.....

CUSTOM TARGETED EMAIL ADDRESSES
No matter what your target is, we can compile a great list for you of people or businesses
that are interested in what you offer. Say, for instance, you would like to send a newsletter
out to people interested in MLM; we can compile a list for you of people currently
involved in MLM.  If you would like a list of people looking for a business opportunity,
we can compile that list for you. You tell us your target; we will compile that list.  We can
even target your list geographically.
example...If your business is selling CD's, and your company is based in NY; we can
gather a list of people in NY interested in CD's.  We have a client that is involved in
MLM, who asked us to target 1000 opportunity seekers to start.  To his surprise he got 7
new people in his downline from just that one mailing.  Another client wanted to send a
letter out to birdwatchers.  We targeted 5000 birdwatchers for him; and he, also, became a
very happy client of ours. We have targeted.. investors, businesses, International
addresses,women, men, age groups, cites, states, doctors, lawyers, etc....

Some of our clients are getting results of 1-40%.  Targeted mailings start at $50 per
thousand, and we can offer you a better price at higher quantities.
