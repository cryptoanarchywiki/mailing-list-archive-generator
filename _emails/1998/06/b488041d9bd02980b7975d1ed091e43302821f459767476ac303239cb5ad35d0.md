It's time to play the dumb export control game.

I have to take steps to prevent non-US and non-Canadian persons from downloading the Twofish source.

However, if someone outside the US manages to get their hands on the Twofish source from my website and puts it up on their website, please let me know.

I would like very much to link to it, so others can get the Twofish code.

Thanks,
Bruce
