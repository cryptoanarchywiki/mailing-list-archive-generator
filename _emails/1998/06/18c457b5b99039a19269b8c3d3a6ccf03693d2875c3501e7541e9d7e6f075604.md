NOTICE OF APPEAL.

Morales will sign and I will file our joint appeal tomorrow.

Morales showed me an e-mail he received from Gilmore 
http://www.cygnus.com/~gnu/.

Gilmore apparently is not interested in pursuing a joint NSA fee waiver
lawsuit.

The public CAN UNDERSTAND a federal agency squandering their tax
dollars on a project which did not work out for the government.  Public
key chips.

Likewise, the public can understand how the government killed Iranians.
http://jya.com/whpfiles.htm

I conducted a survey on NON-TECHNICAL people to see if they understood
what the government did to Iran.  Everyone I talked to understood.

Trying to get much subtler with crypto with the public or even judges
might not work.

Judges or the public might give the government the benefit of the doubt
on the NATIONAL SECURITY/SECRECY issue.

We will see about this.
