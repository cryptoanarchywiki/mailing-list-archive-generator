	Great, so I finally get around to checking PGP's betaweb, and to my
amazement, they finally have a beta version of PGPdisk for 95.  Too bad it
claims that I need to contact a sales rep, and when I follow their link, I
get nothing that would really point me in the right direction.  Any of you
manage to get your hands on a copy? 

	Currently, I am using bestcrypt NP with blowfish.  I am a little concerned
with this however, As I have never seen a crypto-review of the software,
and their website is not too forthcoming with technical details, or known
attacks.  Does anyone have information (or horror stories) from using
bestcrypt?
