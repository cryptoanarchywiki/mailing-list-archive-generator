 How about a group of people joining together to recruit and 
 market.  A group determined to make money. A group where no 
 one is at the advantage. And no one is at a disadvantage. 
 Everyone pays the same and earns the same. This is one of
 the most compelling business opportunities you will find on
 the internet today.

 97% of all MLM'ers fail to reach their financial goal. They
 never earn the kind of money they intended to when they got
 into their business. More often they lose money because the
 average person only sponsors 2.5 people. They end up spending
 more than they make and the only ones who make money are 
 those who join at the top.

 We feel we have found a way to change that.  People helping
 people is our philosophy.  We heard and we created the PAWS
 Association!! If you are a caring, individual and have a 
 desire to help others by also helping yourself, please email
 us with "more info" in the subject line and your email address 
 in the body.  Send it to:  paws-4-u-info@autoresponder.freeyellow.com

You will receive an immediate reply.
