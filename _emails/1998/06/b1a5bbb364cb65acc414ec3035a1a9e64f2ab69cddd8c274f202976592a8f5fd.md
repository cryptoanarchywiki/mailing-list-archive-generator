The second attached NOTICE OF APPEAL was stamped

              FILED
	UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
	DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO
	
	98 JUN 10 AM 9:52

	Robert M. March
	Clerk, ALBUQUERQUE

I put stamped copies of both in the mail to you.

The government only MAYBE understands FORMAL actions.

Informal actions, like letters etc, go into the waste paper basket.

Even formal actions such as the FOIA, PA, lawsuit, and criminal
complaint
affidavit the government will try to BLACK HOLE.

While, naturally, we would like to settle this unfortunate matter so
that we
can all get on to more constructive pursuits, it appears that we will be
doing
a FORMAL ACTION at least TWICE through the Tenth Circuit court of 
appeals.
