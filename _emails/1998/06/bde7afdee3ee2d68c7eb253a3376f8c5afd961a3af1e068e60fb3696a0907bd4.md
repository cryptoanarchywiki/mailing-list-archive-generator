PR Newswire, June 1, 1998 [Excerpt]:

RSA Data Security and Network Associates Announce Settlement of Lawsuit; 
Network Associates Licenses RSA Crypto-security Software

    Redwood City and Santa Clara, Calif., June 1 -- RSA Data Security, 
Inc. and Network Associates  today announced that the companies have 
settled patent infringement and copyright lawsuits brought by RSA 
against Network Associates and its subsidiaries PGP, Inc., and Trusted
Information Systems (TIS).  In addition, Network Associates entered 
into a new royalty-bearing license for RSA's crypto-security engines, 
providing Network Associates with rights to include RSA components 
within a number of Network Associates, PGP, and TIS products.

    Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Network Associates 
will draw on a previously established escrow set at the time of the 
PGP acquisition to pay RSA an undisclosed sum to settle past issues and 
for legal fees.  As a result of today's settlement agreement, three 
federal actions and a court-ordered arbitration related to the dispute 
have been resolved.
