 and smoke it, and everyone's happy because they're all making $480 per
 ounce from the end consumer on this crazy gene-engineered greenbud
 designed, catalogued, and bred by the University of California biology
 departments (esp. Santa Cruz). If it were legal, tobacco shops would stock
 joints for a tenth the price... they need new markets with the stricter
 tobacco legislation; maybe there's a lobby. I watched Dennis Peron battle
 it out with some meat-fisted guy from the Sherrifs' orgs in Congress. The
 cop went on about how

It's illegal because of 1 reason.  The "Know-nothings" have control of the
illegal market.  It's how they invade the bands.  They create a dry spell, and
then they come around offering free/cheap smoke, gain the trust of the band,
and then they say - 'Say, could I create a little official webpage for you?
You need to be on the net anyway (the big lie).  I'll take care of it all for
you.'
