CARDIS Conference Announcement

Final Call for Papers and Panels

-------------------------------------------------------------
THIRD SMART CARD RESEARCH AND ADVANCED APPLICATION CONFERENCE

SEPTEMBER 14-16, 1998

UCL, LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM
------------------------------------------------------------

Aims and Goals

Smart cards, or IC cards, offer a huge potential for information processing
purposes. The portability and processing power of IC cards allow for highly
secure conditional access and reliable distributed information systems.
There are IC cards available that can perform highly sophisticated cryptographic
computations. The applicability of IC cards is currently limited mainly
by our imagination; the information processing power that can be gained
by using IC cards remains as yet mostly untapped and is not well understood.
Here lies a vast uncovered research area which we are only beginning to
assess, and which will have a great impact on the eventual success of the
technology. The research challenges range from electrical engineering on
the hardware side to tailor-made cryptographic applications on the software
side, and their synergies.

Many currently existing events are mainly devoted to commercial and
application aspects of IC cards. In contrast, the CARDIS conferences aim
to bring together researchers who are active in all aspects of the design
of IC cards and related devices and environments, such as to stimulate
synergy between different research communities and to offer a platform
for presenting the latest research advances.

CARDIS 1994, sponsored by the International Federation for Information
Processing (IFIP), held in November 1994 in Lille, France, successfully
brought together representatives from leading IC research centers from
all over the world. CARDIS 1996 was the second occasion for the IC
card community in this permanent activity. CARDIS 1996 was organized jointly
by the Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science at Amsterdam (CWI) and
the Department of Logic and Computer Science of the University of Amsterdam
(UvA).

SUBMISSIONS
Submissions will be judged on relevance, originality, significance,
correctness, and clarity. Each paper should explain its contribution
in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been
accomplished, saying why it is significant, and comparing it with
previous work. Authors should make every effort to make the technical
content of their papers understandable to a broad audience. Papers
should be written in English. Working papers, research in progress 
are welcome. 

Authors should submit: an extended abstract (more or less 5 pages) either 
by email to jjq@dice.ucl.ac.be (we prefer the electronic submission) 
using one of the following formats: postscript, rtf, latex or word 6. 

or send 12 copies of the paper to 

     Jean-Jacques Quisquater 
     UCL/DICE 
     Place du Levant, 3 
     B-1348 Louvain-la-Neuve 
     Belgium

The paper should be formatted using the LNCS format from Springer-Verlag, if possible. 

In any case, each paper should be accompanied by information 
submitted via email to jjq@dice.ucl.ac.be that consists of: 

* a single postal address and electronic mail address for communication 
* complete title, author and affiliation information 
* the abstract of the paper 
* a small selection of the keywords that appear on this call for 
  papers, which best describes the contribution of the paper 

Preproceedings will be available at the conference. It is intended to 
publish the proceedings in the Springer-Verlag LNCS series. Authors of 
accepted papers may be expected to sign a copyright release form.
