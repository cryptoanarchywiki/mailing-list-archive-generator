Spyrus claims in a press release yesterday that NSA
announced declassification of SKIPJACK and KEA on
June 6, earlier than the DoD notice on June 23. 

Does anyone know where and how NSA made this
earlier announcement, and whether there is a document
on it? We've queried Spyrus but no answer yet.

Spyrus has scheduled a June 30 conference on its release
of a FORTEZZA library and products in connection with
the NSA declassification. Bruce Schneier is a keynote
speaker.
