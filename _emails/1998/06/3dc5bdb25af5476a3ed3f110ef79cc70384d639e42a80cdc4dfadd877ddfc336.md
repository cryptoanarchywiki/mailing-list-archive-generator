    Wouldn't it be great to never get junk e-mail again? Well, No one can make you that promise 
unfortunetly....but you can Profit from junk e-mail.There's an old saying "If you can't beat 
em..join em!" You can make incredible money sending your own mass e-mails. If you own 
your own business or have a product or idea to sell , then you probably know that all 
advertising works..it's just a question of whether it's cost effective or not. What could be more 
cost effective that a ZERO cost of adverising? If you sent out 500,000 e-mails which would 
take you only a few minutes to set your computer up to do,and you only recieved one half of 
one percent responce..that would be 2500 people responding to your ad. And the cost to do it 
was NOTHING. Junk e-mail is here to stay, the U.S Congress in their infinite wisdom has 
recently passed legislation legitimizing mass e-mail. So wouldn't it be nice to laugh every time 
you recieve a piece of junk e-mail from someone because you'll know for every one you 
recieve ,you're sending out hundreds of  thousands. If your computer is sitting idle while you're 
at work or play...your crazy! You could be earning money while your asleep,at work or out 
having fun. It's not like you have to sit there and watch it run!
     So why isn't every one doing it. Well, your local internet service provider spent lots of money 
installing filtering equiptment to keep out this so called junk e-mail and in fact for years there's 
been sort of a fun little war going on between the junk e-mail software writers and the internet 
serrvice provider filter software writers to see who could out smart who.The end result is that 
sending mass e-mails legally has become an art . But it's really all about knowing the secrets 
and having the right software.
      AVATAR Publishing is offering you the type of expertise and support that would take you 
years to learn.We know all the secrets (obviously or you wouldn't be reading this would you?)
