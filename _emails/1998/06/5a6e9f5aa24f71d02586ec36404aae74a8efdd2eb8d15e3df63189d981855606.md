June's meeting will be at Soda Hall in Berkeley, near Hearst&LeRoy.

There's a map at http://www.berkeley.edu/campus_map/maps/ABCD345.html

Ian has reserved the 4th floor lounge and the adjacent patio in Soda
Hall on 
the UC Berkeley campus for the June 13 meeting.  There's power,
whiteboard,
and Metricom coverage in the room.  If there are computer demos
needed, we 
can go down the hall to my office.

The biggest problem will be parking; Ian is having the staff here look
in to 
that, but he may need to know _in advance_ who's going to need parking

permits.  Otherwise, you'll have to pop out every so often to feed the
meter.




				Thanks!
