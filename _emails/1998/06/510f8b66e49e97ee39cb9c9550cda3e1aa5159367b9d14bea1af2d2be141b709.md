Extensis Mask Pro-The Best-Selling Masking Plug-in for Adobe Photoshop 
http://products.extensis.com/maskpro_P/

If you think professional-quality Masking is a complex, time-consuming process...

Think again.    Think Mask Pro. 

SPECIAL OFFER: Order Mask Pro for $299.95 and get PhotoAnimator FREE! (a $99 value)

Mask Pro is the award-winning Photoshop plug-in that slashes the 
time it takes to create high-quality masks-with results that 
satisfy even the most demanding professional. Just ask MacUser:  
"Mask Pro is lightning fast, easy to learn, and must be ranked 
among the year's top plug-ins".  But you be the judge.

The Advantage?  Color matching. 

Mask Pro's innovative color matching technology lets you decide 
which colors you want to keep and which ones you don't.  Mask Pro 
does the rest.  Using a color eyedropper, simply select which colors 
to keep and which ones to drop.  Then use Mask Pro's Magic Brush to 
wipe away the unwanted colors.  The Magic Brush removes the drop 
colors you selected, leaving a perfect mask-every time.  You have 
complete control.  

Select color thresholds, edge softness, brush sizes, and more.  
With the zoom, pan and navigator window controls, you can easily 
move around in any image.  And, with the unlimited undo/redo, you 
are free to experiment as much as you like. 

The precision and speed of Extensis Mask Pro cuts masking projects 
down to size.
