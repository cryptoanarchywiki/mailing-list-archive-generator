There are accusations from Russia and France that
PGP International and Network Associates are
improperly and probably illegally refusing downloads
of PGP to legitimate users.

Phil Zimmermann and the companies have been asked 
by the plaintiffs to explain why public affirmations of open 
access are contradicted by illegal restrictions.

Could this be due to pressure from US agencies or
legal counsel to comply with covert directives of the
nations to restrict access or pay the price of being
denied markets?

Maybe this is the way the Stewart Baker policy of encryption
duplicity is being spread from NSA to the marketeers: Public 
assurances of concern and covert arrangements with authority
to assure perpetuation of national security lockdown.
