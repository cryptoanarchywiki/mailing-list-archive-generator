You mean one machine with dual processors? You can't run two operating
systems concurrently on an SMP machine. You can install two operating
systems and choose which one to run, of course.

This is complicated by the fact that there are several FAQs in that
directory. One, combined, is 100K. Juno has a message limit of around 64K,
meaning that the FAQ would have to be split, and I don't know what the
upper limit is on the size of a mailspool at Juno. 

My suggestion is to sneak into a public university computer lab, sit down
at a machine then FTP it and put it on a floppy. Most of the people in
these labs don't ask questions because getting carded tends to really tick
the students off. If they do, say you left your ID card in your car, that
you're very sorry, that you usually don't get asked for it when you walk
in, that you're taking <professor's name> <name of one of his CS classes>
class, that you only need about 5 minutes of time, and that you'll
remember it next time.
