Nice to talk to you.

I see

 Payne v. NSA: Response to Motion to Remand FOIA   June 30, 1998

at http://www.jya.com/whp063098.htm

I opened judge Campos' letter at the fax.  I handed it to the nice
lady.

I wrote your fax number on the envelope.

Then went to Page One Two to look at used VW repair manuals.

Page One Two specializes in used books and CDs.

I am REALLY CURIOUS about what Campos wrote.  Especially on a
Tuesday.  But not curious enough to read the letter now.

Lawyers always plan to have their hate letters arrive on a weekend
or, just before a vacation.  Christmas is a lawyer favorite.

I ordered a engine rebuild gasket set, rod and main bearings, engine
mounts, rings, valve guides and springs, and SPLURGED by ordering an
exhuast header this afternoon.

My '82 rabbit is about guaranteed to fail emissions test this fall.

I ordered today from J C Whitney because the price for the $99.95
header goes up $10 tomorrow.  Perhaps headers will even FURTHER
improve its exciting 20 second 0-60 performance?

I will do the rebuilt in the fall.  

I phoned a member of Albuquerque's underground economy last night.
He will do the labor on the head for $60.  Cash, of course.

I must now ABSOLUTE CERTAINLY complete the digital FX IMMEDIATELY.  
To make some money.

Litigation is more of a long term financial project.  Like Morales and I
have been working on this project for SIX YEARS.

Hopefully this mess will be settled so that I can devote time to another
of my specialties.  Rebuilding Big Block Ford and VW water cooled
engines.  And writing MORE books too.  

Perhaps even write a law book. On pro se litigation.  With Morales, of
course.  But this can be a point for settlement negotiation, of course.  

Later
bill
