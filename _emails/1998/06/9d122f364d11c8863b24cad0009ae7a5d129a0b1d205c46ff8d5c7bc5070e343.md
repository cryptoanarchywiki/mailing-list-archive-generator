R & R Resources.
Symbol: R R R I
Recent Price: 8 3/4 ($8.75/share)

Wall Street analysis from Harvard Equity Research has issued a STRONG
BUY recommendation on RRRI stock.  Robert Renquist was quoted as
predicting a $13.50-$15.00 price near-term with "the high probability of
continuing  appreciation during the 4th quarter of 1998".

Harvard Equity Research's recommendation AATK went
from $3 to $9.00 in ten trading days!

Harvard Equity Research is so confident of their projections that they
are offering their subscribers a money-back guarantee on their
subscription if RRRI doesn't at least double within the next year.

To reiterate: an IMMEDIATE & STRONG BUY recommendation
on RRRI.
