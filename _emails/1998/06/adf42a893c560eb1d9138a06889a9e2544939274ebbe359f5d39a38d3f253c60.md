John Young

I am reading http://jya.com/sitesec.htm a bit more carefully.

You have NEVER WRITTEN SO MUCH.

Fishing was great.

I used a 

          $10 THE  INSTANT CALLING CARD [TM] 
          VOCALL COMMUNICATIONS CORP
	  The World's Most advanced prepaid Calling Card

which allows access with a pin of 718-2455-7091-xxx [my SECRET]
in ENGLISH, SPANISH, ARABIC, URDU, KOREAN, JAPANESE, GERMAN, 
FRENCH, ITALIAN to call you TWICE on Saturday.  At only $.14/min.

I left one message about Xandi and spiking computer keyboards.

Xandi MADE low-power transmitters, 

http://www.gernsback.com/HyperNews/get/forums/resource/226.html

like the kind I MIGHT use IF I were going to spike a keyboard [most
which use an 8051

 
http://www.apcatalog.com/cgi-bin/AP?ISBN=0125475705&LOCATION=US&FORM=FORM2]

so that the keystrokes would be broadcast.  

This, of course, defeats crypto attempts to cipher keystrokes.

But I DO NOT DO, or have to do, ILLEGAL THINGS for the FBI or any other
government agency.

I, as a DOE contractor employee, was protected under 10 CFR 708.
http://av.yahoo.com/bin/query?p=10+cfr+708&hc=0&hs=0

But 10 CFR 708 does not appear to be working well in my case. 

Therefore, we had to try other remedies.

VOCALL is getting real close to digital cash, one of Orlin Grabbe's 	
interests.  http://www.aci.net/kalliste/dcguide.htm

I have to do mostly technical work on the digital FX this week but will
try to
get two notices of appeal to the Tenth circuit written.
http://jya.com/whp043098.htm

Morales and I, with all the publicity you and Orlin have given us, can
go all the way to the Supreme Court with our genocide and crypto
deficiency lawsuits. http://jya.com/whpfiles.htm

Pro se, of course.

Too bad NSA did not take my criticisms of its shift register work
more constructively.  http://jya.com/da/whpda.htm,  click on Appendix S

Perhaps NSA should have worked with some of us at Sandia to come-up
with fixes to overcome deficiencies. This unpleasantness could have been
avoided.

I've had ideas to improve shift register algorithm operation before.

Let's all hope for settlement of this UNFORTUNATE matter before it
gets worse.

Later
bill
