Greetings,

I've come across this program on the net which claims to give "secure
communications"... could any of you folks comment of this program? 

	Speak Freely 6.1 For Windows 95/NT (295K) 
	Author: John Walker 
	Homepage: http://www.fourmilab.ch/speakfree/windows/
	Description: Real time one to one audio chat, half or full duplex,
bitmap 	transfer. Encryption for secure communications. Might be slow
with modem 	connections. 

The text below is part of the text on the homepage...

========================
Speak Freely for Windows

                         Release 6.1

Speak Freely is a Windows application that allows you to talk
(actually send voice, not typed characters) over a network. If your
network connection isn't fast enough to support real-time voice data,
four forms of compression may allow you, assuming your computer is
fast enough, to converse nonetheless. To enable secure communications,
encryption with DES, IDEA, and/or a key file is available. If PGP is
installed on the user's machine, it can be invoked automatically to
exchange IDEA session keys for a given conversation. Speak Freely for
Windows is compatible with Speak Freely for Unix, and users of the two
programs can intercommunicate. Users can find one another by
communicating with a "Look Who's Listening" phone book server. You can
designate a bitmap file to be sent to users who connect so they can
see who they're talking to. Speak Freely supports Internet RTP
protocol, allowing it to communicate with other Internet voice
programs which use that protocol; in addition, Speak Freely can also
communicate with programs which support the VAT (Visual Audio Tool)
protocol.
