The above message was sent by Dr. Dim.
(He has a natural aversion to spelling his own name correctly
 when pretending to post as not Dr. Dim.)

And, yes, 'vznuri@netcom.com' is a nym for Dr. Dim: just check
out his posts at DejaNews...Dr. Dim is a math phud, and "Vladimir" was
"plonked" by Dr. Dim immediately after I said it was a nym.

   Dr. Dim had an infamous alias "Vladimir Fomin" too.
