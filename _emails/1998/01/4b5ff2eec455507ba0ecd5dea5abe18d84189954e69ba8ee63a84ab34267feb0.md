Your point is well taken.  I should have explained that I am
seeking assistance for altruism from someone who is interested
in crypto policy.  For example, no one is compensating me for
the many hours I've volunteered to pull off this two-part
lecture series (and it was quite a challenge to get anyone
with government connections to go on stage with John Gilmore).  See 
   http://www.cs.umbc.edu/events/fall97/crypto.shtml

I'm also trying to help students by suggesting a concrete, worthwhile,
interesting project through which to learn about www programming.

I am open to the idea of a prize fund:  I will augment the
prize with 100% of all prize donations mailed to me.  If
each of 200 people send me $1, the prize fund will grow to $250.
