There are a bunch of people subscribed to a mailing list called
cypherpunks.  There is no organisation, this is an anarchy, as can be
readily observed :-) I only used `list of terrorist organisations'
because I think that is the US government term for their little black
list.

Even for contracts I think you would be better off not connecting to
your meat space persona if you could help it.  eg. Use a nym, post a
bond with a high reputation cyberspacial arbitration service, use
designated verifier non transferable signatures to allow the
arbitration service and other party to the transaction to verify your
signature, but to make the signature non-transferable to other
parties.
