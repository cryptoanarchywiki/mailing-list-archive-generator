Suggest that Microsoft encourage peer review of of the portions of IE 
used for encryption and authentication by publishing the source code 
used to implement these functions.  The quality of the code would 
certainly improve (I don't believe it could get worse ;) if MS 
incorporated suggestions in a timely matter.  Such a move would also 
do much to improve Microsoft's reputation in the "hacker" community 
(that's "hacker" in the good sense, not the intruder/cracker/vandal 
sense) by showing that they understand that "security through 
obscurity is no security."  If Microsoft (and other companies) hear 
about the need to do this often enough from enough different source, 
perhaps they will begin to listen.
