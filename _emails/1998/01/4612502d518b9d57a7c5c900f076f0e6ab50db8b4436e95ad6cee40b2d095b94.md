When I lived in Alaska I knew someone who built such a thing for hunting
bears. I never got to fire it, but it was supposed to have a kick like a
mule. (Even with the shock absorbing stock.)

The hardest part is getting the 50 cal ammo.  (He had his Federal firearms
license and was in the National Guard, so it was not too difficult for
him.) Getting AP and other special ammo would be doubly difficult.
(Non-specialty ammo could be reloaded as long as you could get molds and
primer caps.) 

I guess it depends on your military and/or black market connections.
