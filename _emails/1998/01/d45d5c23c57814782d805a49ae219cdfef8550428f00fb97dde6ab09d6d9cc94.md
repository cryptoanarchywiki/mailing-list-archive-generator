Spin doctor bullshit. Without the research there isn't anything to publish.
By banning the basic research we would in fact be banning the publishing of
the results of that scientific research.

Not at all. Equating swinging of ones fist in a empty field and swinging it
into somebodies nose and then taking that supposition as justification to
ban fist swinging *is* most certainly unconstitutional. Furthermore, robbery
isn't illegal under the Constitution unless its the federal government
taking the material and refusing to follow the Constitutional directive to
pay for *all* property, irrespective of how it was gained, for public use as
those duties are relegated per the 10th to the purvue of the states.

The question here is whether Congress even *has* the power to regulate those
sorts of behaviours without an amendment being passed by the states to
surrender their authority per the 9th and 10th to the federal government.

Without doing the research it isn't possible to think very much about
cloning except in a *very* abstract manner. That forcing of abstraction
against ones will may very well infact be unconstitutional.

The articles contemplating the amendments are irrelevant to this issue. Only
the actual amendments are relevant. What people might *want* to do has
nothing to do with what they *can* do under the limiting documents of this
country.

No, they are a result of political wrangling by small groups to gain
political power and the economic and social conseuences thereof. They also
result from a clearly premeditated absolution of the Constitution that these
self same 'representatives' gave an oath to uphold with their lives. The
justification that is profered is the ethics of the constituents.

Your a law professor and your logic, respect for the Constitution, and
basic scientific comprehension is this bad? No damn wonder we're in the shit
hole we're in now...
