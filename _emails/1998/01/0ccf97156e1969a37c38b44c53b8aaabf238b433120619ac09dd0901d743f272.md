It would be humorous to even have the modulus and exponent -- if
someone can obtain them, I'll package it up as a working PGP key, and
give it user id of Spook GAK key <dirnsa@nsa.gov>, and submit to the
keyservers.  Then we have solved the key escrow implementation
problems for the US government -- anyone who wants to send them a
message can simply add DIRNSA to the list of recipeints.

I don't have a copy of Notes, otherwise I thought this a most fun
exploit to attempt.

The above "solution" to key escrow infra-structure calls from Freeh
etc., should be credited to Carl Ellison; probably others have
proposed it also.  Carl offered to sign some cheif spooks key, if he
would generate one for the purpose, cheif spook declined the offer.

I observed a few times before that now that Lotus have organised with
the NSA to produce such a key, we can do the job of implementing the
voluntary key escrow infrastructure for them.  (It is voluntary
right?)
