I've allways found myself in a rather precarious
position, when it comes to identifiable my car is.
When I frequent a location (coffee house, restaurant)
more than once, people suddenly recognize me because
of the artwork on my car -- a mural of an oriental
dragon painted on the driver's side, and a blue-n-
black phoenix-in-progress on the passanger side.

Obviously, this makes it easy for law enforcement
officers to identify me after clocking me.  I remem-
ber my first (and last, as far as I'M concerned)
police chase, when I was trying to catch up with a
pal who I had to meet, who I spotted heading south
while I was heading north on a particular superhighway.
A cop flew past going north after I turned around,
screamed through the midway, and flipped on his
lights.  I escaped, amazingly.

I don't want to paint my car camo, because even
though the murals were free (a la my adopted little
brother), they took time and hold sentimental value
(not to mention the fact that they turn a borning
commuter hotrod into something I don't have to use
the license plate to identify in a parking lot).  Is
there any other way to circumvent visual aquisition
and identification of my vechicle?

Besides a Klingon cloaking device, of course.

Best wishes and fresh-roasted peanut taste,
The Sheriff. -- ***<REPLY TO: sheriff@speakeasy.org>***
