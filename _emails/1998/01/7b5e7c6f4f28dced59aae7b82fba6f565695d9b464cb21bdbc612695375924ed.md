     Ah, that explains why a bad-ass with a vocabulary would spout
such nonsense.  That little liberal arts college up the river from my
alma mater can corrupt even the finest minds.

     Rather than go down yet another libertarian v. statist debate
rathole, I'll just quote one of the more notorious (former) list
members by saying:  "I have a solution for that."

     The federal government should immediately stop purchasing and
using Microsoft products.  No more monopoly, no court cases, no
delay.  Free market and technical solutions are always superior to
legal remedies.
