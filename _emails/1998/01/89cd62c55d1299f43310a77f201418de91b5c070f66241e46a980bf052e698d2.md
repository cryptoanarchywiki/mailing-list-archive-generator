About our FTP site

EFGA maintains a high bandwidth, low volume FTP site. Our servers are
located about 15 feet from a well managed network of high bandwidth fiber
connections to multiple backbones. We are capable of peak speeds of 10MB,
or about six times the speed of a T1. If you are the author of software
that supports EFGA causes such as Free Speech, anti-censorship, privacy, or
cryptography and would like for us to host your software, please contact us
for more information.
