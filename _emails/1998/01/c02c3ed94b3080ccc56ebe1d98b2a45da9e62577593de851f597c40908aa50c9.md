Ummm why reinvent the PGP wheel in an exclusively Win32 form?  PGP (at
least 2.x) has undergone peer review and seems secure.  Is that true of
your system?

I don't wish to sound too negative and there are interesting features
(small EC keys for one and smaller signatures).

Another interesting and similar program is Pegwit which is portable code
and also has these advantages.

But there is an intrastructure of PGP key servers and most people have
PGP keys, already.  Maybe we should be building on standards rather than
building new ones.

Of course PGP isn't GPLed but we will have g10 soon which will be
real freeware and developed outside the USA to avoid legal problems

ftp://ftp.guug.de/pub/gcrypt/g10-0.1.3.tar.gz 

Its *very* prebeta but maybe will become the cypherpunk program of
choice.

There is also a freeware SSH ("Psssst") planned I think by someone else.
