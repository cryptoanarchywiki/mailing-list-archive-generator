A couple of other points that I should have added. Your base assumption that
light and heat are not the same thing is faulty. They are in fact identical
so to speak of the 'law of optics' and the 'laws of thermodynamics' as
different things is in error.

What happens in the *real* world is that a point is reached where the amount
of energy emitted by each foci exactly balances the amount of energy
received by each foci. We in effect reach thermodynamic equilibrium, better
known as heat death. This term means that the minimal level of disorder has
been reached by the system under study and without outside intervention no
change, outside quantum fluctuations, will take place.
