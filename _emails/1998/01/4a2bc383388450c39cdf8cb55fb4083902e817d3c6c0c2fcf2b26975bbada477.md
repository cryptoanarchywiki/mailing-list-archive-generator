Company expects to acquire $50 million in assets by mid-1998</B>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  
DALLAS --<FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3><B> </B>UNFC<B> </B>), a diversified real estate investment firm formerly known as Universal Fuels Company, is quietly acquiring over $50 million in previously undervalued, undercapitalized or mismanaged commercial properties and making this new major player<FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3><B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>one of the best moderate-risk real estate investments in 1998.  
 
Founded in 1975 as Universal Fuels, the company provided uranium to the world as an alternative fuel, but as uranium became less used as a nuclear fuel source than other more economical and useful materials, Universal Fuels' stock declined almost to extinction over several years.  The stock price was less than 1 last year.
 
Four months ago officials from Camden-Townwest, a privately held real estate investment firm, approached Universal Fuels former management about converting Universal Fuels into a publicly traded real estate conglomerate.  Camden-Townwest, founded in 1994, grew from $19,000 in cash to $3 million in assets in three years without seeking any outside capital.  Since the change in management and corporate mission last October, <FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3><B> </B>UNFC<B> <FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3></B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3>has seen its stock value increase by over 800%.   
 
Remington-Hall  is now making its move to increase assets at a tremendous rate.  By mid-year management expects to acquire in excess of $50 Million in office buildings and multi-family properties at a significant discount to their market value. "We have been referred to as 'Cat Burglars of Real Estate'," said Douglas Fonteno, president & chief executive officer, "and that's a title we plan to keep."
 
<U><B>Douglas T Fonteno</U> </B>previously Chairman of Camden-Townwest and formerly with Merrill Lynch, is Remington-Hall's new President & Chief Executive Officer.  <U><B>Larry Hood</U></B>,  <B> </B>formerly Chief Operating Officer of Pizza Inn and Chief Financial Officer of Reliance Mortgage Company, is Remington-Hall's Chief Financial Officer, giving the new company immediate and substantial financial integrity.  <U><B>Wade Hyde</U></B>, previously public relations and investor relations executive for Blockbuster Video and FoxMeyer Corporation, is Vice President of Marketing & Public Relations. 
 
Currently Remington-Hall<FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3>is seeking to be listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq National Market.  The company anticipates announcing over $10 million in newly acquired assets by the end of January.
