This is INSANE.  How could someone be so stupid as to announce
such a feature in a newspaper.  I guess this means that if a
terrorist sees a Cabinet minister with such a computer, he had
better shoot to kill.

The whole point of a feature like this is that its existence is secret.
Someone is NOT paying attention.
