It's much worse than this.  The violation of Bell's inequality implies
that changes to the basis used to measure one particle cause changes in
the observed state of the remote particle.  Of course this can't be used
to transmit information; we all agree on that.  The remote particle has
a random orientation.  But the point is, Bell's theorem shows that the
remote orientation depends on how the local measurement is done.

This is not a matter of simply perceiving or deducing what the conditions
are at the remote branch, as in the envelope case.  A better analogy
would be an envelope which could be opened in two ways, from the top
or from the bottom.  If you open from the top then the remote envelope
will have the same contents as the local one, while if you open from
the bottom then the remote envelope will have the opposite contents.
In each case the contents are random; the remote observer has no
idea whether you opened from the top or the bottom.  But somehow
your decision on how to open the envelope (what basis to measure the
photon) is changing how these globally separated subsystems relate to
each other.  (This analogy isn't perfect, either, because it might seem
that magic changes to the local contents could make the envelope work.
Bell's reasoning shows that it is the remote photon's state which must
be altered by the choice of how to measure the local one.)

This is the fundamental flaw in the envelope analogy, which makes it
seriously flawed and misleading.  It gives the impression that some kind
of hidden variables (the contents within the envelope) can easily solve
the problem, when nothing could be further from the truth.  It papers
over one of the most mysterious facets of quantum mechanics, by making it
appear to be mundane.  It represents a fundamentally mistaken way to view
remote correlated particles.

OK, so you can't explain it.  Fine, it is indeed a mysterious phenomenon,
and no doubt you are correct that more insights will come in the future.

Now, compare this with the envelope analogy Tim May offered:

Are you at all tempted to resort to such language in trying to understand
how the envelopes could work?  Is it puzzling how we could open one here
and find a 1 and suddenly know that there is a 0 in the remote envelope?
Do we need to learn more about how measurements of envelope contents work
before we can begin to tackle this thorny philosophical conundrum?

Of course not!  The envelope case is transparently obvious.  There are
no puzzles here, no complexities, no confusion.  The only confusion
is in the minds of those who think that correlated envelopes have
anything to do with correlated photons, or that the hidden variables
which perfectly well explain what is happening with the envelopes shed
any light whatsoever on the workings of nonlocal QM systems.

No, the current argument is over how much of a jackass Tim May is.
