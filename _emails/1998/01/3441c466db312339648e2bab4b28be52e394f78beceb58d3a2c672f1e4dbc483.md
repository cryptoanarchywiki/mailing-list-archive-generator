On the news tonight, channel 3 and 31 both featured stories about
Sacramento sheriff deputy supervisors getting "semi-automatic AR-15"
rifles.  It was hilarious.  Channel 3 showed a close-up of the receiver,
which was clearly marked with "M16A1".  I got this funny feeling that them
thar AR-15's will rock 'n roll if the deputy supervisor finds himself in a
North Hollywood style situation...can you say Disinformation, boys and
girls?

"If ye love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquility of servitude
greater than the animating contest for freedom, go home from us in peace.
We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that
feeds you. May your chains set lightly upon you; and may posterity forget
that ye were our countrymen."
