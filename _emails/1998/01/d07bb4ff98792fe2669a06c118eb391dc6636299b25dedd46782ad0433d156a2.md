No.  Doing something to the first photon does not do anything to the
second, much less change its polarization.  The operators for
polarization for the two photons commute, so they are simultaneously
measureable.
 
The statistical correlation of measurements done on many pairs of
photons, with a choice of axis for measuring the polarization selected
on the fly, reflects that predicted by quantum mechanics for non-local
collapse of the overall wave function.  It is wrong to interpret this
as something done to one photon having a physical effect on the other.

Sorry, *OUR* physics explains all of this quite nicely.

This isn't even wrong.

There is no "swap of polarizations." The wavefunction of the entire
system changes quite smoothly with time, under the influence of the
usual operator.  Measurement places the system in an eigenstate for
the thing measured, and simultaneous measurements on branch systems
may show correlations consistant with non-local collapse of the
wavefunction.  None of this implies any physical effect on one photon
as a result of something done to the other.

This isn't even wrong, either.
