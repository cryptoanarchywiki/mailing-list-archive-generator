>      according to a nationwide survey of freshmen.

>      An annual study by the University of California, Los Angeles, for
>      the Washington-based American Council on Education found a record
>      low number of college freshmen showing much interest in politics.
>      
>      Just 27 percent of the nation's 1.6 million freshmen believed that
>      keeping up with political affairs is a very important life goal,
>      less than half the percentage recorded in 1966. Just 14 percent said
>      they frequently discussed politics, down from 30 percent in 1968.
