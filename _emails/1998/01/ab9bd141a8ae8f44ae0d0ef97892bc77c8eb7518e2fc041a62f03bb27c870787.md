uh huh, and we stopped him by ... bombing hiroshima AND nagasaki?
I think there are greater madmen in the world than their poster
boy Hitler who financed his rise....

bzzzzzzzzzzt, he eventually published at the urging of his friend Halley
and then got involved in bitter disputes about credit ..

  Once he had solved the

bzzzzzzzzt, I believe he was a member of scientific communities at the
time. he also was intensely 
involved in reforming the government monetary system. as a younger person
he was a loner, I agree.

hey everyone, go see "wag the dog" and think one nanosecond
about the world we live in and how it came to be the way
it is....
