First of all, the standard Dragunov scopes use weird Russian batteries
that are hard to find here. (the batteries are only used to light the
crosshairs). Also, I have been told that Dragunovs are not as accurate as
M1As (2MOA or so).

What I do like about SVD is their mean looks. Maybe it is my Soviet taste.
