    America's abundance was created not by public sacrifices to "the
    common good," but by the productive genius of free men who pursued
    their own personal interests and the making of their own private
    fortunes. They did not starve the people to pay for America's
    industrialization. They gave the people better jobs, higher wages, and
    cheaper goods with every new machine they invented, with every
    scientific discovery or technological advance- and thus the whole
    country was moving forward and profiting, not suffering, every step of
    the way.

    - Ayn Rand
    
    
    
    In the United States the majority undertakes to supply a multitude of
    ready-made opinions for the use of individuals, who are thus relieved
    from the necessity of forming opinions of their own.

    - Alexis de Tocqueville
