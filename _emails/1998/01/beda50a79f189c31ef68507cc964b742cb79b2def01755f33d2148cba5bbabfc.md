Jim, I'm forwarding this to the list:

Oh, shit.  Well, it seems as though Compaq has been pulling away from Intel
lately (towards AMD), so perhaps this will be a GoodThing(tm), because
otherwise DEC might turn out to be like Apple, except to die a much, much
slower death.

I think so.  Tim had mentioned that last he heard the Intel/DEC deal was dead.
Perhaps this is what he was talking about.  The thing is, how much about the
Alpha does Intel know, and does this mean yet another round of lawsuits?
I'm afraid that Intel may know enough now to make a 1GHz pentium, which would
probably a ModeratelyBadThing(tm).  I'd much prefer DEC to save mankind and
lead them into the next millenium.

Yep, but for how much longer?  Some elephants never die, and right now it
looks like Intel can once again save MicroSoft's OS by hardware (ironically
via DEC).  NT bloats as the hardware gets faster.

I'll aways have a fondness in my heart for installing RSTS from a TU-10
tapedrive and having to wait almost an hour for it to fall off the spindle
before having to start all over...
