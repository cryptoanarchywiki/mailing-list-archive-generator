Came across this by chance...having never heard of this 'disgruntled'
web site, I'm curious as to how the PO managed to learn about the
offending story...if they fired him because of an explicity fictional
article expressing a fantasy shared by vast hordes of Americans then
it kind of looks like the Post Office 'went postal' on one of their
employees.

>   got published on the Internet, in which he depicted a worker who was
>   so fed up with conditions in his San Jose office that he pulled out a

>   appeared in December in the on-line publication Disgruntled, which

>   The story, "Scrooged Again," appeared to have struck a nerve with his

>   the postal service effective Jan. 27 because of "unacceptable and
>   disrespectful conduct."
