Thanks, though this sounds like a silly judgment.

It looks to me as if the great majority of judges and 
lawyers, and hence presumably the great majority of CEOs, are 
blissfully unaware that one can do anything with a fax other 
than scan it in from paper and ink at one end, while it is 
printed out on paper and ink at the other end.

In actual fact a very large proportion of faxes never see 
paper and ink at either end, creating endless opportunities 
for manipulation.

This is a big problem for me, because I want to scare
businessmen into using digital signatures.
