Why not? The morons can't even write HTML, even *with* the help of some
"HTML authoring kit." If they could we wouldn't be greeted with image maps,
unnamed links, unnamed inline images every 5 words, frames, broken CGI
scripts...

So I, at least, wouldn't find it surprising. The sheeple are blind, naked,
and shit stupid.
