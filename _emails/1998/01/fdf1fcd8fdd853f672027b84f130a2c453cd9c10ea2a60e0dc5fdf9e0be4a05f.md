So, you agree with Tim May's statement that:

You agree with the foolish statement that the behavior of correlated
photons is no more weird than sending out two envelopes?  I thought you
had more sense than that.

Are you under the impression that opening envelopes can in any way
violate Bell's inequality, as measuring correlated photons can?  Please!

How do you explain the violation of Bell's theorem in QM?  What is your
nice, cozy, friendly, un-weird explanation?  I'm curious whether you are
going to sacrifice locality or reality.  Somehow I think you'll have to
go beyond what is necessary to explain the behavior of envelopes.
