Doesn't seem terribly likely.  Typically ciphers will look strong until
someone discovers a chink.  The chink will sometimes lead to a serious
break, but not always, and not always quickly -- but at that point the
cipher looks weak.  Your best chance at encrypting stuff that needs a
long shelf life is with a cipher that's had a lot of analysis and
plenty of intrinsic key, like 3DES.

The former.  The S-boxes they replaced were bogus, and the ones they
came up with were good against differential cryptanalysis -- better
than random ones.  There's no a priori reason to believe they knew
about linear cryptanalysis, and in any case Matsui's l.c. attack on DES
is better than brute force only in situations where you have a great
deal of known or chosen plaintext.  So how come you claim they aren't
secure?  DES isn't suitable for long-archived info, but is still OK
for short-lifetime data against a not-too-motivated attacker: its
only known weakness for this application is its key-length, not its
S-boxes.
