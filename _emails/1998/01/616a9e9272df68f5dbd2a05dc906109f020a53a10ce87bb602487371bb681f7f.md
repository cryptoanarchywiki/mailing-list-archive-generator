What do you mean 'shortly before', the collapse is instantaneous. There ain't
no time to send anything. The channle can carry one bit of data, the
collapse has occured (1) or it hasn't (0). It isn't like a modem, CD, or
other comm channels where you have a bandwidth and can piggy back signals
for synchronization by using parts of that bandwidth.
