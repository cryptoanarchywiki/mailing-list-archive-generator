I've got a question for y'all.

Some idiot finally sent me a junk e-mail message that
I couldn't do anything about with what I have the 
knowledge to do -- reading the headers turned up only
one ISP, which was apparently owned by the spammer.

I'm hoping you guys would know where I could find out
more about this individual -- I'm hoping that he does
in fact buy his service from someone else, and if so,
I'm not sure how to find that out.  If he doesn't, is
there anything I can do?
