	Here's something I came across on one of my other lists.  I looked
at the URL, and it looked good.  Anybody able to confirm/deny?  And what
kind of implications do y'all think this'll have for Netscape's security?

	(What if improved security code comes to Netscape from bodies
/outside/ the US?)
