Malarky, the history of science (and of human civilizations) is replete with
example after example of idividuals discovering the same basic theme and its
proof. Just the three examples we have been using (Newton, Gauss, Fermat)
are filled with comments about contemporaries discovering the same result.
Review Darwin for a moment, he chose to share the fame for evolutionary
theory with Wallace because he had reached the same conclusion. Had either
Darwin or Wallace not chose to publish the result would still have been
found and shared.

Only in the context that they are both poets who write poetry.
