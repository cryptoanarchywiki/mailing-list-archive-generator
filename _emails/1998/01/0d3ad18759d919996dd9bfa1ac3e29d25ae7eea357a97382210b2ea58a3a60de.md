Tim,

Keep in mind that each post came from a different author, with perhaps one
or two exceptions.

With regard to the names, I know of no formal list policy, law, or custom
that would stop me from forwarding with names attached. However, I thought
it might stifle discourse on a relatively intimate list if folks thought
their posts were blasted around the Net to thousands.

I was my judgment call, and I make no excuses. Take the ideas for what
they're worth.

-Declan
