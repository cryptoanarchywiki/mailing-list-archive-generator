...
I believe Bill is genuinely afraid that if he published his algorithm,
then he'll be killed. I don't know enough to judge how realistic his
fear is. I've been involved in serious discussions of assassinations
over smaller amounts of money than is at stake here. He displays great
courage by saying anything at all at this point.

I also have an extremely high opinion of Bill's (and Adam Back's) technical
abiltities. That is, I'd be much less surprised if Bill Payne (or Adam Back)
comes up with some truly remarkable breakthrough than someone I've never
heard of or someone I heard of and don't have such a high opinion of.

Yes, it would be most interesting/impressive if Bill demonstrated his
ability to factor using some of the published chalenges.
