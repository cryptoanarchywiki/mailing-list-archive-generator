> The New York Times Book Review, Tim Weiner :
> Left in draft form at his death from brain cancer three years ago,
> completed by his friends and family, Secrets is Mackenzie's legacy: a book
> obsessed. Like the man, it is an unruly piece of work, but it grabs you by
> the lapels and holds on.
> 
> Synopsis:
> Drawing from government documents, scores of interviews, and numerous
> stories of CIA malfeasance, the late journalist Angus Mackenzie lays bare
> the behind-the-scenes evolution of a policy of suppression, repression,
> spying, and harassment beginning before the Johnson administration and
> continuing to the present. 11 illustrations.
> 
> Card catalog description
> This eye-opening expose, the result of fifteen years of investigative work,
> uncovers the CIA's systematic efforts over several decades to suppress and
> censor information. Angus Mackenzie, an award-winning yournalist, filed and
> won a lawsuit against the CIA under the Freedom of Information Act, and in
> the process became an expert on government censorship and domestic spying.
> Mackenzie lays bare a complex narrative of intrigue among federal agencies
> and their senior staff, including the Department of Defense, the executive
> branch, and the CIA. From cover-ups and secrecy oaths, to scandals over
> leaks and exposure, to the government's often insidious attempts to monitor
> and control public access to information, Mackenzie tracks the evolution of
> a policy of suppression, repression, spying, and harassment.
> 
> The publisher, University of California Press, www.ucpress.edu , 08/20/97:

> "If anything is more corrupting than power, it is power exercised in

> summons to vigilance to protect our democratic institutions."
> --Daniel Schorr
> 
> "The late Angus Mackenzie has left an appropriate legacy in Secrets: The
> CIA's War at Home, a fitting capstone to his long career of exposing
> government secrecy and manipulation of public information. Secrets is a
> detailed, fascinating and chilling account of the agency's program of
> disinformation and concealment of public information against its own
> citizens."
> --Ben H. Bagdikian, author of THE MEDIA MONOPOLY
> 
> "Scrupulously reported, fleshed out with a fascinating cast of characters,
> skillfully illuminating a subject the news media seldom looked into and
> never got straight, Angus Mackenzie's last and best work richly deserves a
> posthumous Pulitzer -- for nonfiction, history, or both."
> --Jon Swan, former senior editor, Columbia Journalism Review

> A muckraking adventure in the violation of First Amendment rights. Although
> it probably won't come as a surprise to most readers that the federal
> government is capable of spying on its citizens, Mackenzie professes a
> certain bewilderment at the lengths to which the CIA went to suppress
> dissent in the days of Vietnam. The veteran left-wing journalist, who died
> of brain cancer in 1994, began his career as the publisher of an antiwar
> rag called the People's Dreadnaught; harassed by campus police, he was
> forced to suspend publication, although he later won $2,500 in a lawsuit
> against Beloit College over the matter. At a national level, he writes,
> similar suppression was the order of the day. Although the CIA is
> constrained by law from conducting investigations ``inside the continental
> limits of the United States and its possessions,'' in fact, Mackenzie
> charges, it concocted an elaborate counterintelligence program against
> various home-grown protest groups in the 1960s and early '70s, reasoning
> that it was taking antiterrorist measures and thus living up to the spirit,
> if not the letter, of its charter. Among the targets, Mackenzie writes, was
> Ramparts, a venerable leftist magazine that managed to earn the wrath of
> the Feds by reporting on that very internal spying. Other targets were the
> libertarian guru Karl Hess, renegade CIA whistleblowers Victor Marchetti
> and Philip Agee, and a host of lesser-known dissidents. The CIA emerges as
> the heavy, naturally, but the real villains in Mackenzie's account are
> various policymakers from the Johnson administration to the present.
> ``Incrementally over the years they expanded a policy of censorship to the
> point that today it pervades every agency and every department of the
> federal government,'' he writes. And, he continues, that change was so
> gradual that few guardians of the First Amendment noticed. Mackenzie is
> occasionally over the top, sometimes glib. But his charges ring true, and
> civil-liberties advocates will find much of interest in his pages. (11 b&w
