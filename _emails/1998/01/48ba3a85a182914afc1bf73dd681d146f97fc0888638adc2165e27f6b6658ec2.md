You can also make the cookie.txt file read only.

Both of these options only make the cookies valid for the current session.
They do not make them go away all together.

Some of the site that cookie bomb do so out of ignorance.  Old versions of
Apache have such cookie bombing set by default.  (They changed the name of
the option soon after.  The option was originally called "Mod_cookies" and
people left it figuring that if they disabled it, they could not use
cookies.  Actually it is a method for tracking usage patterns within a
site.  The module was renamed to reflect that.)  

I am willing to bet that most of the sites that send cookies are not even
using the data they provide.  Few log file crunchers can make use of the
cookie data from user tracking in any worthwhile manner. Any company that
relies on cookies to hold onto membership information is foolish. (Cookie
files only hold 300 entries.  Surf enough and the membership infomation
gets washed away with the tide.)  Cookies are not needed for storefronts.
There are better ways to accomplish the same thing. (There are CGI
storefronts that save the information on files on the server, for instance.)

I can understand why cookies were thought up in the first place.  Much of
cgi programming is overcoming the stateless nature of http.  Unfortunatly,
the idea was not thought out that well...
