>>The Jefferson Club is proud to present:
>>David Friedman, Professor of Law at Santa Clara University
>>to speak on
>>"A World of Strong Privacy: Promises and Perils of Encryption"
>>
>>Luncheon
>>Wednesday, February 25th
>>12:00 noon
>>Ming's Villa in Palo Alto
>>
>>Reserve your place at http://www.ipser.com/jeffersonclub.
>>
>>A major theme in discussions of the influence of technology on society has
>>been the computer as a threat to privacy. It now appears that the truth is
>>precisely opposite. Three technologies associated with computers, public key
>>encryption, networking, and virtual reality, are in the process of giving us
>>a level of privacy never known before. The U.S. government is currently
>>intervening in an attempt, not to protect privacy, but to prevent it.
>>
>>Professor Friedman will explain the technologies and demonstrate that current
>>developments, if they continue, will produce a world of strong privacy, a
>>world
>>in which large parts of our lives are technologically protected from the
>>observation of others. He will discuss the likely consequences,
>>attractive and
>>unattractive, of that change and provide a brief account of attempts by
>>the U.S.
>>government to prevent or control the rise of privacy.
>>
>>For a preview of the talk, see "A World of Strong Privacy: Promises and
>>Perils of
>>Encryption"
>>(http://www.best.com/~ddfr/Academic/Strong_Privacy/Strong_Privacy.html)
>>Come prepared with questions for Professor Friedman.
