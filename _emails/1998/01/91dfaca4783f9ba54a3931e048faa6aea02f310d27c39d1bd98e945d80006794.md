Not much. Biggest boost from writting free software (other than the fact
of having the software) is to one's reputation capital. If one was
intrested in entering into a new field of programming (commercially)
having a few programs under one's belt never hurts.

Shareware is not a bad alternative. Thoses who like your programs and are
intrested in supporting your efforts are usally willing to spend a couple
of bucks. I wouldn't plan on quitting your day job but if your code is
popular it can help offset expences.

Another approach is to do what Phil did with PGP. Freeware to individules
and pay for business use. This depends on whether there is a business need
for your programs or not.

Get a job at a University. :)

If you really had somthing intresting that you were planning on doing you
may be able to get some type of research grant.

I think that you find that most freeware/shareware authors hold down a 9
to 5 job to pay the bills and write their code on the side.
