I have Igor, works pretty well for some paper additives. If it's a plastic
base then use finger nail polish remover or model cement thinner.

How in the hell can you say with a straight face burning paper with alcohol
is any more a fire hazard then burning paper? You don't burn the paper while
it's in the alcohol bath, but remove it and then burn it. If you try to burn
it in the bath what you get is just like gasoline. The fumes burn not the
alcohol itself so the paper doesn't get nearly hot enough to do any good.

You're making burning paper, additives or not, a lot more complicated than
it is.

If you're that worried about it go down to your hardware store and buy a
hand-held torch. Additives or not that will burn it.

Good luck.
