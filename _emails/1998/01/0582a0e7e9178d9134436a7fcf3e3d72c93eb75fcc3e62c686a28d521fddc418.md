You interpret Jim as implying "maybe assassins would develop
scruples"; 

this doesn't look like the meaning of what you quote Jim as saying:

 "You'd be able to purchase deaths of unworthy people, but it might be
  only at a dramatically higher price."

it looks more like Jim was suggesting that free market forces would
tend to prevent deaths of lesser known people.  Think about it -- it
would be dead easy to get a contract on Barney due to the number of
people who know and hate him -- but on an average neighbor, who is
completely obscure, you'd easily have to fund the entire bet yourself.
