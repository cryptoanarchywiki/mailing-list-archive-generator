"Name me one..."? How about Gauss, who didn't publish many of his results.
Or, of course, Fermat, ironically linked to Wiles.

Not to mention Darwin, who sat on his results for almost 20 years, and only
issued a paper and his famed book because he learned another naturalist was
about to announce similar conclusions.

Publication and, more importantly, discussion and challenge, is often very
important to the advancement of science. But is some cast in stone
requirement? Of course not.

Building an artifact which embodies the science, for example. Exploding an
atom bomb was pretty clearly a demonstration that the science done was
correct, regardless of whether there was "open literature" or not.

This is just too easy, refuting Detweiler's points. So I'll stop here.

I suggest he get his lithium prescription refilled.
