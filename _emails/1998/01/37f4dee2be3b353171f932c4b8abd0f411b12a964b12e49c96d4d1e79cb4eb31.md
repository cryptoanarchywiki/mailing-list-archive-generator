Hi,

If you're interested in the basic technology used in many of the current
and proposed processor architectures I strongly recommend the following:

Advanced Computer Architectures: A design space approach
S. Sima, T. Fountain, P. Kacsuk
ISBN 0-201-42291-3
~$50.00

It was published in 1997 and covers various analysis of many of todays
CPU's (unfortunately it doesn't do the Alpha) and discusses means to
get realistic comparisons between them. It also covers some of the white
paper architectures that have come out in the last 3-4 years on proposed
architecture upgrades and alternatives.
