Just read in an architecture rag called "Metropolis" about floating
cities for the rich!  I guess being a nomad is becoming chic.

Anyways, the two ships are

ResidenSea   958ft long with 250  1100-3200 sq ft homes ranging from
$1.2-$4.3 million each.  driving range putting green 2 pools, helipad
gardens, retractable marina.  According to the mag, this one looks like it
will get built with construction to start soon.

Freedom Ship  4320 ft  25 stories  for 65,000 people starting at
$93,000  includes library school bank hotel hospital, light
manufacturing and 2 landing strips!!!  How Stephensonesque.

I'll be very depressed if the commercial folks do this before the
hackers.  Now, I wonder where I put that decommissioned aircraft
carrier?   :-)
