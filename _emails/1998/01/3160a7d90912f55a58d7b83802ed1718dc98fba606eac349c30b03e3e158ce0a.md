I have it on good authority that either the plan has been scrapped or that
it has simply gone nowhere (same result).

I'm not so sure about this, Robert.  I've heard the rumor that it is a crime,
but I have also heard that if something is delivered to your box, it is yours
and you are not required to send it back unopened if it is not addressed to
you.  I tend to believe the latter, as it is the side of the story shared by
USPS employees.

It certainly is a federal crime, however, for the indended recipient to get
into your mailbox to get a message which was incorrectly delivered to you,
however!
