The Houston Hacker Tour

Houston                March 3-4, 1998


Okay, you convinced your organization to embrace an open systems
environment. You assured everyone that you and your colleagues were on top
of thesecurity angle and you've make great strides.  So why are you still
nervous?

Because paranoia and vigilance are the heart and soul of corporate
security. And, whether you're a CIO or a security analyst, whether you
manage your organization's entire security strategy or a small piece of
it, you know the threats.  You know there are countless points of
vulnerability.  You know a breach at any one of those points could be
crippling.  You know "100% secure" is a myth.

Unfortunately, they know too - the people lurking outside your firewall,
the people tapping into your phone lines, the people diving into your
dumpsters. They're patient. They're persistent.  And they'll find a way in
if you let your guard down.

You know you can't eliminate vulnerability, but you can reduce it.  The
question is, how?

Find the answers at this interactive two-day session where Cambridge
Technology Partners will introduce you to the enemy, their methodologies,
and the steps you can take to protect your enterprise.


What IS IT?
Cambridge Technology Partners is pleased to present the New Hack Tour, a
two-day "get-smart" session where you can go head-to-head with leading
security analysts, security practitioners, and yes, hackers.  Together,
you'll explore liability issues and organizational behaviors, learn
underground tools of the hacker trade, and discuss attack strategies and
detection/protection methodologies.


WHO SHOULD ATTEND?
Security touches everyone in your organization - from the ground floor of
ITto the executive suite.  Cambridge recognizes this.  The New Hack Tour
is uniquely designed for diverse audiences - from technical engineers and
system architects to CIOs.  In fact, the tour features two tracks, one for
the people battling in the network trenches and one for the people who own
overall security strategy and are battling to improve it.


HOW DOES IT WORK?
During the session, participants from across the corporate landscape will:

*      Day One:  Address - in one of two tracks - the micro- or
macro-level
security issues that directly impact their organizations and their
careers.

*      Day Two:  Collaborate with hackers in one comprehensive track to
build new
and more effective models of corporate security.
