First, I knew the answer, I was looking for a lead-in...thanks.

Then how, Constitutionaly speaking, do they have get the responsbility to
search when it is clearly a judicial responsibility (that is where it is
in the Constitution) and in cases such as Evans -v- Gore the Supreme Court
has found that the judicial body can't transfer or relinquish it's
responsibilities even if it *wants* to?

I suspect that, again Constitutionaly speaking, the only system that would
pass strict muster would be something similar to the Dutch which prohibit
the police from executing a search until *after* review by a legislative
representative.

This is a rhetorical question, I don't expect you or anyone else to
respond to it. Just think about it...
