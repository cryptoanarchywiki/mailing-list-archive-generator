True.  But in an Eternity model without copyright, someone could be one of
the first customers to download the data, then upload it again under a
different name.  The only thing the original uploader would have as
an advantage would be indexing information, potentially -- it's easier
for me to download ms word by going to the eternity equivalent of
http://www.microsoft.com/ than to go to 
http://www3.pop3-167.adhoc.warez.location.ai/edf3/filez1.zip.

There's no real way to put the genie back into the bottle unless you can
send people with guns to beat people up who store your data as a third party.

Data disappears from Eternity once no one cares enough about it to pay to
have it stored.  That could mean someone doesn't pay in advance for the data,
or no one is willing to invest disk space in the hope that it will in
the future be downloaded.

Providing eternity service costs money.  Anything which lets users circumvent
this opens up the potential for denial of service through consumption of
resources attacks.  Even if billing is fundamental, you still have the
potential for the NSA to spend $100m to buy all the eternity space available
at any point.  This is why you also need market mechanisms -- if the NSA
is willing to pay a premium for eternity service just to keep it out of
the hands of the populace, then running eternity servers is a great 
investment, so capacity will increase until the NSA can no longer afford
to buy all of it.

A difficult part of designing a working Eternity service is to keep people
from "stealing service", in terms of consumption of resources, during
set up, indexing, etc.  Basically, you need to make sure that to the 
greatest extent possible, anything which is a potentially scarce resource
is sold, not given away.

You then are vulnerable to someone spamming the system, unless you give
the server operator some way of knowing if this encrypted data is likely
to be valuable.

I think both payment models should coexist.  But there's no reason that
the server operators are the only people able to speculate -- it could
be just another random user.

You can have arbitrarily complex payment models, since the enforcement
agents can exist (must exist?) as eternity objects in their own right.

No, the most feasible attacks for a resourced attacker are custom ASICs
optimized for key testing, as were recently described.  Distributed
workstation cracking is a parlor trick if you have a billion dollar budget
for key cracking.

The NSA has general purpose HPC resources for purposes like signal processing,
AI, etc., not for brute forcing people's keys routinely (although perhaps for 
a weak and nonstandard cipher, it would make sense to use general purpose
machines).  Even a corporation would be better off using FPGAs or ASICs for
key cracking once you get past 56 bits.

I assume the attacker is evil and rational.  I also assume that the
entire legal system has been subverted, and that extralegal operations of
any size too small to make the new york times front page are possible.  And,
any entity which deals with the government (just about any) can be subverted.

Thinking that the major internet gateways between providers are bugged by
the NSA isn't really too unreasonable if you accept those assumptions.
