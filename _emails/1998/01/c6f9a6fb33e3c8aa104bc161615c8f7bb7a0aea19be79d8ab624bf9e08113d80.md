Because whether she is a honest user or one who is intent on subverting the
system is relevant and must be taken into account.

I disagree. I believe it is possible to create a system which is secure and
provably so, irrespective of something as nebulous as 'trust'.

Been there it's part of what I do for a living, it's fun.

This is true if Mallet is attacking the key system, it is not strictly true
if Mallet is attacking a specific user.

> Yup, that's why the user has to check it by hand.

Then the Eternity model is doomed to fail. 90%+ of users who might want to
use a data haven model don't have a clue as to how it works or how to
actualy check it.

I disagree, though I am not able to prove it at this time.

My point exactly.

As with Adam, it feels like we are beginning to go around and around with
nothing new to add. I would suggest that we drop the issue for the moment
and come back to it at a later time with a little more reflection.
