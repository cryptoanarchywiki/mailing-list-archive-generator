There's the Intel model - give away software to sell new hardware.
There's the Linus Torvalds model - people pay you to speak at conferences.
There's the w3c model - pay money if you want it now, or wait and get it for
        free next month.
There's the book model - give away the software and sell the documentation.
There's the PGP model - give it away until it becomes popular, then sell it.

...and then there's the Microsoft model - give away 'free' software and
   charge for the OS to run it...
