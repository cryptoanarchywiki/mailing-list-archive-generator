I think this gets into legal issues.  Consider fraudelent insurance and
gambling schemes
involving collaboration -illegal, but hard to detect unless someone turns.
Consider a hit man who takes the fall for the boss, so that his family 
is taken care of.  

In these cases and in an AP scheme, the law can't prove much if 
certain parties collaborate.  Maybe the winner of the
"BATF agents blown up in 97" bet *is* John Doe III; but since
the investigation claims no such person, and the winner is not
in jail now, the winner has fairly earned their reward
via their skill in actuarial matters.
