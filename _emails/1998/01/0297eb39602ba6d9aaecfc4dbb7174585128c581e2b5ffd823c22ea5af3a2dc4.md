Actualy, if we are talking about instantanious events the event itself is not
frame relevant, thought exactly when and where the event occurred may be.
Consider an electron when it changes orbitals does so in zero time. So the
question that the photon was emitted is not at issue, now where that photon
came from and at what clock tick may in fact be.
