MISTAKEN IDENTITY: Police in Bangkok, Thailand, arrested an American
  tourist who climbed repair scaffolding to the top of Wat Arun (Temple
  of the Dawn) and refused to come down. After 10 hours, the man was
  subdued by police and turned over to the American Embassy. He
  identified himself as God, but officials determined he was Brandon
  Simcock, 27, an employee of Microsoft. (Bangkok Post) ..."Termination
  Notice. Reason for Termination: Impersonating CEO."

parting,
