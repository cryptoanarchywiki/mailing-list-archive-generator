My commentary is that if he had made an effort to disseminate even more of
his work during his lifetime, then they would have spawned more research
sooner, and he would have gotten feedback which would have refined his
ideas even further, and that would be good for the mathematics in general.

Economic motivation is the best.  Right now a lot of good mathematical
research is kept proprietary because it has practical applications
(whether in cryptograpy or finance or some other industry). Publishing
in peer-reviewed jounrnals is a pain in the ass and the only people who
go through with it are colege professors seeking a tenure or a promotion.

The reason why patents were invented was to encourage inventors to
publish their inventions rather than keeping them a trade secret;
eventually the patent would expire and the new knowledge would
benefit everyone.

I wish I saw an economic incentive for folks working in the industry
(including the NSA et al), and the tenured professors to publish.

Woulx you have liked it better if Truman gassed the japs?

Is that all that it takes?  Maybe I should post more often.

Timmy sounds like Janos Bolyai, who claimed that Lobachevsky was not a
real person, but a tentacle of Gauss.
