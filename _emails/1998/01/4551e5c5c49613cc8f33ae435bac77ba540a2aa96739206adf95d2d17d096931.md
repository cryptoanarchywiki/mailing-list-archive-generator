Isn't this going to increase latency and increase the likelihood of both
sureptitious attacks (I notice the request in newsgroup A and begin putting
my mitm requests in the other newsgroups - the odds being that I will get
the data and then forward to the original recipient with small changes) as
well as must plain missing the request?

Be shure to pay with cash and use an anonymous name and address. Considering
the cost of accounts this could be quite expensive. Many services do provide
the first 2 weeks free or similar features. I predict that should this model
be put into practice at a very broad level the ISP's won't give the free
trial-periods to anonymous accounts.

Is this going to be a live model or a VR relicant? If it is a live model
then it should be relatively trivial to determine that persons
identification and location. Another question that comes up is how many
strippers are going to participate in this if they know the consequences?
It's one thing to spend the night or a few weeks in the tank, a whole nother
thing to spend years in there.

These still have to show up in the actual packets and are open to sniffer
attacks. Also, the individual packets can be traced from router to router.
Lot's of blind alleys but you'll get there eventualy.

SWBT will currently sell T1 access to homes for as little as $214/mo. Would
you settle for $2,568/yr.? Note that this price doesn't include routing and
name resolution. I'm still (3 months later) trying to get SWBT to tell me
how much they will charge for this - they supposedly offer it but I have yet
to find an actual business office that support home delivery of service.
