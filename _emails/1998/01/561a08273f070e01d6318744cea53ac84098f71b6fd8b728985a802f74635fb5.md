It will increase latency yes.  It will also make the attackers job
harder.

If you are talking about posting requests it sounds like you are
describing Eternity BlackNet, eternity USENET basically acts like a
FAST-TEXT TELETEXT system -- keeps the most recent copy of pages as
they are updated, there is no request to post because the reader acts
entirely passively, and is harder to trace because he is passive.

I don't know who SWBT are, but I suspect they don't offer service in
the UK.  If they did at that price I would have them install the T1
tomorrow.
