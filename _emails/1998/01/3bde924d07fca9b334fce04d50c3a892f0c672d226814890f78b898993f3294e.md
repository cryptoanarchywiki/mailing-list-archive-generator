ObWoMD: "8. (p. 82) Distinguishing nuclear explosions from other
events, such as large lightning bolts or explosions of meteors in the
atmosphere, is not easy.  The satellite reacts less to the total
energy of the blast than to the form of the flash.  Nuclear explosions
have a characteristic two-humped flash caused by gamma ray induced
formation of nitrogen pentoxide (N2O5).  The time between humps is
called the "bhang metre" and is characteristic of the type of weapon."
