I think the essential issue is to convince the
courts that running a cryptoarchive background
process (distributed Eternity server) makes you a "Common Carrier", with
all the legal protection you get from that classification.  

I agree with you and Bill that
this is feasible once the legal profession gets a clue.. maybe in our
lifetimes :-)

The worst-case situation is a very widely 
dispersed government denying that kind of 
common-carrier status.  Imagine congress
signing something giving the UN that power,
then declaring all encrypted-anonymous-archives 
illegal.  Send a few blue-hats or a cruise missile
to take out the non-signers.  Back home: "who cares, just the UN protecting
the children, so what if
a Cayman casino or Togo bank gets toasted.  No one was hurt, and the world
is safe for imbiciles"

In such a scenario you could take other steps.
Steganography helps keep you from being noticed.
Bursty-communications patterns are harder to 
stop/trace.  CDROMs are readily manufactured
hidden, and disguised.

Perhaps the cypherpunk edition of Netscape
will include anonymous remailing / traffic mixing
services by default :-)
