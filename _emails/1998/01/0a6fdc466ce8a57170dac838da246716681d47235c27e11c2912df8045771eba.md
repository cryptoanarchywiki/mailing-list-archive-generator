Interested in Exchanging Links!!

I would like to take a sec of your time to introduce myself. But I do not want to force you to do anything you do not want to do. (Unless you are into that HA!! HA!! ) Anyway, you can check me out at my site and that will give you an idea of who I am.
http://shanesworld.com/
Now let's talk business. (Want to swap banners?)

I have http://shanesworld.com/ on the web that receive anywhere from 30,000
to 60,000 hits a day and growing. Please respond to this email and I
will place your link on my site. 

Just give me the name and URL of your Site and a brief description (how many free pix, thumbnails, and previews?) Also include a banner attachment in your mail. (Not Required)


You can find my banner and info at http://shanesworld.com/linkexch.html link my banner to http://shanesworld.com/. 

After we are done with all the BS let me know where you've placed my link.( REMEBER, I WILL GIVE YOU AS MUCH LOVE IN THE PLACEMENT OF YOUR BANNER AS YOU GIVE ME!!! )

I am also involved in many live feeds featuring friends and myself. If you are interested in any info at all, let me know. 
I look forward to hearing from you and working with you in the future.

Love, SHANE
