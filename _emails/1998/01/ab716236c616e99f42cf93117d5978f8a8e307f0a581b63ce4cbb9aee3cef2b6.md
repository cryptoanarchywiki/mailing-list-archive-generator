After someone mentioned "E", Electric Communities (http://www.communities.com/)
enhancement to the Java security model/language/etc., I checked it out

It looks useful for a distributed agents based system (which is what
I'm shooting for...the long-awaited goals mailing will either get sent
today or tomorrow, depending on if I fall asleep immediately after sending 
this).

I don't think anyone will argue that it's inherently bad.  However, I'm
interested in knowing what people think about using a vaguely proprietary
product (albeit from a company with lots of cool people) in a piece of
software like a reference Eternity implementation.  I personally would prefer
to stick to something as standard as possible, but E has a lot of features
I'd want to use, and would end up re-implementing on my own.

(I think if you had a JVM interface to eternity such that an object, its
currency, where it should send its results, etc. in a standard form
(the standard eternity agent encapsulation) were encapsulated, you
could build a lot of Eternity out of interacting agents inside another
Eternity implemention, inside ... up to inside a traditional network.
(more on this idea later))

So, this is very rambling -- I mostly wonder how people feel about using
a fairly non-standard language extension in something like Eternity.
