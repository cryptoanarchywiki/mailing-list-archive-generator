How are these fundamently different? Assume for a moment that as a user of
an eternity server the source is the data I want.

The point I am making is that whether the author is corrupt or not is
irrelevant.

Ok.

Pretty expensive and rather unrealistic I suspect. Where does this random
user come from? What is '(thresh)'? What good would an anonymous key
signature provide? You can't verify it within the web of trust model, that
would imply the author wasn't anonymous which takes us back to the 'friends'
attack. How do we know that some number of these cypherpunks aren't turned?
Are you proposing that the user test all 100 of the signatures? Which
realisticaly is the only way to verify any given one of them. Not very many
people will go to that extreme simply for grins and giggles.

The standard is programs over ~10k lines is not comprehensible by a single
individual on a line by line basis.

'small compilation system' of what? What who wants it to do? The author?
Mallet? The end user?

It isn't the key of the author or the eternity server that is under attack
by Mallet. It is the security of the individual user who is under assault.

> 2) The user wants to run the code, because it's Just That Cool.

We're talking here about users who want to get data that is illegal or
otherwise incriminating or dangerous to one group or another. In particular
let's consider the situation of a Lebanese freedom fighter in Isreal or
perhaps a 'Free Burma' revolutionary in China.

Which doesn't effect the ability of Mallet to resign that code at the users
end in order to break the users local security.

[material describing script verification deleted]

Mallet can re-write said script, especialy with the sorts of latency that
the Eternity Server forces on the end user, such that it is consistent with
the bogus keys the end-user gets. It is simply much easier to write scripts
in a day than say 10 minutes.

The end user may not have people available to trust is the point. The reason
the transport mechanism is relevant is that it is much easier to spoof a
verification script if the user is not going to be surprised with 24 hour
turn around on requests, whereas a responce time measured in minutes lessens
the window of opportunity to Mallet significantly.

It may come as a surprise to you and others but not everyone in the world
can pick up a phone and call a 100 people all over the world and not raise
some suspicion.

> Implementing a keyserver in Eternity has the same issues

While it is perfectly permissible to design Eternity or any data haven with
inherent key servers, I believe it is a bad idea from a design perspective
because it makes the code even larger, decreases the potential for monetary
motives for indipendant key servers to appear, and if the server is
compromised then the key server is also. It is more expensive if Mallet can
be forced to deal with two indipendenat operators then a single monolithic
operator.
