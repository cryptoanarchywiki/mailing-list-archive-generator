We are looking at selecting 100 64-bit keys out of a set of 2^64,
that is not a lot of opportunity there, given a random key generation
process, for a lot of commen patterns in the key set. If we don't have a
lot of commen patterns in the text we don't get a lot of compression.

In this case we can't afford any loss.

Which if we do the math requires something in the neighborhood of 33:1,
for a loss-less algorithm that's a pretty hurky boundary condition.

My point exactly, which would lead us to the conclusion that our requirement
of a 33:1 compression factor is not realizable.
