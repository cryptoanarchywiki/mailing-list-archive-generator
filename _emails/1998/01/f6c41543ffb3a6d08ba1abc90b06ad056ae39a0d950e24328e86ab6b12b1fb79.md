An authoritative-looking message from Ken Jenks of NASA appears at
http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Corridor/8148/quaranti.html .  It
says this section was repealed 26 Apr 1991, and that the intent was
to allow for a quarantine after the Apollo missions.  The full text
appears on that page.  It talks about exposure to lunar material
from NASA space shots, rather than UFO contacts.
