In the US, the remaining provisions of the CDA would shield an ISP from
prosecution concerning child porn.  In fact most everything but
intellectual property cases, which may be shielded by other means.  If the
eternity server acts merely as a pipeline, without the operators
participating or encouraging illegal activities, then there is a good
chance that the eternity server could be treated as a service provider in
the same fashion and be immune from prosecution directly.
