Well I am not "reinventing the wheel".

Crypto Kong implements a different identity model.  It does
not suppose that there are "true names".

This leads to substantially easier identity management
(largely by abolishing identity management)

As a necessary consequence of this, if you happen to be
communicating with two different Bob Jones, Crypto Kong does
not attempt to discover which one is the one true Bob Jones
and which is the evil man in the middle Bob Jones.  It merely
keeps them distinct by applying different labels to them.

Secondly, PGP simply is not being adopted by the masses.  Of
course right now, two weeks after release, Crypto Kong is not
being adopted by the masses either, but with very little
identity management, it is far easier for the masses to use.

If you try and shove that identity stuff onto people they
will not do it.  Too much like hard work.  They will happily
let the government licensed authorities do it for them.  The
PGP model clearly has not flown yet, and it is not going to
fly.
