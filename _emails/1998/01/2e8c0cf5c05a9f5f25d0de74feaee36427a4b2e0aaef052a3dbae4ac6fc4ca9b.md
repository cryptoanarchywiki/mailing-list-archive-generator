Corporations and businesses which feel more secure with a commercial
enterprise backing the system.

There are *many* businesses which have been unix shops exclusively in the
past who are now implimenting NT based servers for a variety of reasons.
In some cases the intent is to drop the Unix boxes completely over the span
of say 5-10 years as alternate applications become available.

It's a bigger market than the home, soho, or individual corporate user at
stake.
