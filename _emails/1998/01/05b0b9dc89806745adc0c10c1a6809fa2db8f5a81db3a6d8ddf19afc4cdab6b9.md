I'm not sure I am convinced by this argument.

The "enemy within" seems to be the main focus of the discussions in 
the CP list. When the 'luckless squad that happens your way' is 
manned by your countrymen at the command of their (and your) 
government, what then?

As far as I can see, the result would be a *very* bloody civil war. 
The outcome may indeed be less obvious than in a 'conventional' (i.e. 
unarmed populace) civil war, but the cost much higher.

This is from the standpoint of a 'sissy' European. I admit I am 
poorly equipped to comment on the American Zeitgeist. However, my 
experience of civil war victims (refugees from the E-bloc) suggests 
that we should be concentrating on social revolution before we tool 
up for military. There is more to be won, with a potentially much 
lower cost.
