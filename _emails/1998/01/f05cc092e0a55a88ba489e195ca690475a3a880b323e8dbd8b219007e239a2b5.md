Thanks for the help - I've tried the latest version with no luck. The docs state that it works under win95 now but there are still some issues with NT 4.0   Has anyone got this to work under NT?  I really want to give something back to the remailer/cypherpunk community and this is the only way I can think of.

If anyone has experience of the Winsock remailer and can help...
