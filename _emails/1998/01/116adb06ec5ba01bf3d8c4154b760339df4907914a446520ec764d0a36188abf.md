microsoft.com, firefly.com, and parts of yahoo.com wee the only sites I found
that 1) try to set the cookie, 2) test if the cookies is what they expected,
3) refuse to proceed if the cookie isn't what they expected it to be.

Here are a few more neat wafers that I use with junkbuster:

wafer Apache=0
wafer cookieswork=1
# .hotwired.com randomhacker cypherpunks (cypherpunks was already taken
# and password wasn't cypherpunks)
wafer u=randomhacker:XXXrHYVJ4gKTg:888306120:
# barnes and noble cypherpunks
wafer userid=21200U41QE
# .ffly.com v2 random_q_hacker cypherpunks (again, cypherpunks already taken
# with a different password)
wafer NAME=random%5Fq%5Fhacker
wafer ALIAS=random%5Fq%5Fhacker
wafer FIREFLYTICKETV2=a3d11c2224f036b8c5da227f07ac7694b3430734d16595e7ff09c9216dbac8af6
wafer FFLYID=381916
# .ffly.com v3
wafer USERNAME=random$5Fq$5Fhacker
wafer USERID=4031415
wafer USERKEY=rrL2ECYFs8Q
wafer PASSWORD=rrL2ECYFs8Q
# I haven't quite gotten this wafer to work:
# .firefly.net random_q_hacker(.firefly):cypherpunks (won't let user=password)
 wafer FIREFLYTICKETV3	XWHKLLTVMLTVYWVJEHUNMHa\XVLHNHLGHIVRVUKKKKKK
# .yahoo.com cypherpunks:cypherpunks
wafer Y=v=1&n=fh5fme4ro4p10&l=2of74hfkdai/o&p=f1s022r2030r
wafer M=dp=sum&lg=us
wafer T=z=34caa94c

While this is tangentially crypto-relevant, let's start a thread on feeding
wafers to various tracking software to convince it that the same cypherpunks
entity is doing all of our browsing.  Can several of people agree on feeding
the same values of the following wafers:

# .pathfinder.com
wafer PFUID=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
# webcrawler.com
wafer AnonTrack=FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
# RealMedia (NYTimes et al)
wafer RMID=0
# .hotwired.com
wafer p_uniqid=0osqlPoOiF7XKIGM6D
wafer s_uniqid=0osqlPoOiF7XKIGM6D
wafer unique_id=1668800885692100
wafer NGUserID=ced54487-134-885708087-1
wafer session-id=0
wafer session-id-time=0
# .geocities.com
wafer GeoStitial=885690000
wafer GeoId=0
wafer EGSOFT_ID=0
wafer CFID=0
# .four11.com
wafer Urid=68847000
wafer DOL=0
wafer DTRACK=0

Protect your privacy by confusing the software that would violate it.
