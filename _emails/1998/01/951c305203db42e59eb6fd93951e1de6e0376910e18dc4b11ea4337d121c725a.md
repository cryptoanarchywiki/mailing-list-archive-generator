Look, I realize I was probably asking a stupid question, but
you don't have to be quick with me.  I figured that there were
some things that I could do that I simply didn't know about,
beyond the simplicity of returning the spam the postmaster, root,
and abuse account of the last ISP the spam was routed through.

My interest isn't simply in getting rid of the spam.  "Empty
Trash" is a pretty simple concept on Eudora.  What I want to do
is fight the flow -- and while there may be as many as 10 spammers
per ISP out there, every spam I do something about is one less
server that accepts messages for routing that don't come from one
of their accounts.

If that doesn't make sense to you, don't bother answering the
e-mail next time, eh?

Best wishes and fresh-roasted peanut taste,
The Sheriff. -- ***<REPLY TO: sheriff@speakeasy.org>***
