IMHO, this is pure grade A bullshit.  If you included PGP in MsMail, and
Eudora and pine and elm from the get go, everyone would use it.  Poeple
use what they have and few learn about what they could use.  PGP for the
masses has been a widely discussed topic here.

Unless you can convice the mailer makers to include Crypto Kong in the
mailers, you're not gonna get any mass adoption either.  Still it's likely
to be much less than PGP anyway since it's already been out for ages.
Still there are plenty of plugins for Eudora to do PGP mail, and those who
know about it and need it use it.  The rest, well, they don't know and
won't know until someone snoops their mail and they get a bug up their
asses to get privacy.

Regardless of how good your program, if you ignore the basic facts and
stick to "Crypto Kong has feature X,Y,Z which PGP lacks" you won't get
anywhere either.

Mind you I'm not comparing PGP, nor Crypto Kong on any feature or security
level, just basic human nature.  If you get Microsoft to incorporate it in
every copy of win 98 and Office, you can bet fuckloads of people will use
it.  If you can get all the ISP's out there that offer service and
software to include it, you can bet a lot of people will use it, etc.
