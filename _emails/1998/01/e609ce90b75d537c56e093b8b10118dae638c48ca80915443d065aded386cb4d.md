I think, Declan, that deleting the author's name is a Big Problem. I
inititally assumed you wrote these words, and was preparing a rebuttal
(esp. to the fanciful " Intel's Portland facility has 800 programmers
charged with coming up with something as cool as the operating system
developed by Next. Stay tuned." piece of nonsense.

But then I went back and read your "deleting author's names" line, so now I
have no idea who I'm rebutting.

You have essentially made this author "Anonymous."

A better approach is to ask his permission, for something substantive like
this piece is, and then either post his words with his name, or not post it.
