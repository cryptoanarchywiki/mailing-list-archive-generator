Tim has missed the most important part of this whole episode: the fact
that Linda Tripp was wearing a wire, and apparently working for the
FBI.  Think for a moment about the position this puts what's his name 
in -- you know, the guy who's name begins with an "F", who works for 
Janet Reno...

In fact I am amazed that cp's in general haven't picked up on the
potential significance of this.  Think back to just a few short weeks
ago, when Freeh and Reno had their little spat...

What do you think about congressional resistance to wiretaps, in 
light of current events?
