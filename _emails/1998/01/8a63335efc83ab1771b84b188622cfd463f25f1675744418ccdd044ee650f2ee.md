Considering that the federal law enforcement agencies have had decades to
deal with organized crime and such over a national and even international
level, 100' level warrants is not even a resource strain if the pay off is
large enough. Now if we had 10,000 or 100,000 the picture begins to change
radicaly.

This is another problem with the entire crypto process as now implimented.
Users of keys, either for encryption or signing, tend to think of the keys
as long term entities. Considering the increase in computing power, the
coming ubiquity of law enforcement monitoring on the network, increased
payoff for hackers as the traffic of personal info increases, and general
human failure keys should in fact be changed often (say a couple of times a
year, annualy at least)

These are all criticisms of the TCP/IP and associated network mechanisms and
not specific faults in the remailer model. It has to work with what it has.
