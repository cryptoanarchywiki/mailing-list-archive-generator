There's the FSF model - give it away and ask for donations, but offer
	expensive "bundles" that are bought by enlightened companies and/or
	enlightened Dilberts at un-enlightened companies.
There's the Red Hat model - give it away on an ftp site but charge for a
	nice package with manual and support.
There's the Aladdin model - give away old versions but the latest is non-free.
There's the GNU ADA model - form a corporation to develop free software, and
	sell support contracts.

If you are interested in hack value and benefits to humanity, you are
probably best off avoiding the proprietary and shareware software models
(the two which will generally get you the most money, incidentally). But
this does not mean that you cannot write commercial software that is free;
see <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html>.

It is worth noting that freeware does not necessarily have to be free of
charge; the important thing is that it be _freed_ software, or "libre"
software -- as opposed to "gratis" software.
