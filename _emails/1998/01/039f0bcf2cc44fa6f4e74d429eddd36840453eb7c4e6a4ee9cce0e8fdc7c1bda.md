On 1/12/98 3:32 PM, Tim May (tcmay@got.net)  passed this wisdom:

 I think many of us are understandably nervous about the mistakes that
could be made in the process of perfecting human cloning. But Tim's
point is well taken, yet another potential 'slippery slope.'

  It also begs the question again of 'are we getting too paranoid?' I
think the nanswer is still "no, not yet", as the Klinton
administration proves to us almost every day it seems.
