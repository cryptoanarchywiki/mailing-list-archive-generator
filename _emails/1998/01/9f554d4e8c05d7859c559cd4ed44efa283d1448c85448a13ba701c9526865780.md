The story posted is an urban legend.

It is NOT an urban legend that someone has been tattooed with "RSA in
Perl". A picture of Richard White's tattoo is at:

http:/www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/rsa/tattoo.html

It is also not entirely an urban legend that this has been joked about
-- a friend of mine (a Greek computer security expert who's name I
won't mention) was forced to spend a couple of years back in Greece
after completing his PhD because of restrictions on his original visa,
and his friends joked heavily about giving him a crypto tatoo to
render him non-exportable. However, it was only a joke (albeit one
that was told regularly in computer security circles because the
person in question is fairly well known among security weenies.)

However, the stated story is completely bogus.
