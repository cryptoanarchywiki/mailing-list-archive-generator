Nothing in quantum teleportation has been shown to propagate signals faster
than light. (If you don't believe me, look into it. Start by reading the
FTL discussions about Bell's Theorem.)

I personally doubt that any flat spacetime topology (e.g., wormholes
excepted) will admit any FTL signals. A lot of things would dramatically
change if FTL communication existed...not the practical "communication"
issues, which are human social minutiae, but issues about synchronization
of reference frames and causality violations.

Who's your supplier?
