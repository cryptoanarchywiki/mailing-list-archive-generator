I agree, but "contribute to death" needs to be operationalized.  Here's a
proposal:
If a homicide suspect is arrested within N months, they will be isolated
from the net
and the owner of the winning ID will have to perform a challenge-response.
Since
the suspect couldn't have replied, they are different; if a pair
collaborated, well,
when a hit man is caught, his payoff matrix will usually make him turn in
the client.

The N-months might be a weakness since there is no expiration time on
homicide.
But in cases where cause of death is known and it can be proved that the
incarcerated is not the winner, it looks good.  E.g., a bet that "more than
two BATF agents will be blown up in 97" would be safely payable now that those
fellows with the short haircuts have been convicted.
