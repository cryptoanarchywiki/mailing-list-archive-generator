Go down to your local security or electronics supply (not Rat Shack) and
you should be able to buy a polarized loupe and see it directly.

If it has any N in it then don't burn it in a closed space otherwise you
will get various xCN compounds. These are very toxic, KCN is Potassium Cyanide.

In general you don't want to burn most plastics in closed spaces or be
downwind because they do give off various toxic chemicals. You can check
with your local fire dept. and they can provide references on the plastics
used in television cases, 3.5 floppy covers (v the disk itself), video tape,
etc. and the sorts of gases they give off.

When my house burned 3 years ago both my cats were killed because of smoke
inhalation (approx. 9 computers and bunches of other plastics went up). It
was not a pretty sight. Congealed blood from lung eruptions on their lips,
very blue tinge to the skin, etc. Not a pretty sight.

If you're smart avoid burning plastics except under very controlled
circumstances.
