 Toshiba Unveils Fast Formula For Elliptic-Curve Cryptography 

 Tokyo -- Toshiba Corp. has developed an arithmetic formula which it claims 
 offers the world's fastest processes of elliptic-curve cryptography. The 
 formula cuts processing time by almost half from current methods used in 
 elliptic-curve systems. 

 Toshiba's formula is based on the Montgomery arithmetic system, a special
 method of calculation which requires no division. 

 Elliptic-curve cryptography is considerably faster than the Rivest Shamir 
 Adleman (RSA) system currently in common use. 

 Toshiba hopes to apply the system in a wide range of fields, including 
 corporate information systems and electronic commerce.
