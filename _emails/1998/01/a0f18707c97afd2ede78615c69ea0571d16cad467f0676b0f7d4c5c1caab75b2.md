Joe Kennedy was a common thug, no different from the Gambinos and the
Genoveses. He made millions of dollars during the prohibition smuggling
whiskey from Canada. He personally murdered numerous of fellow drug dealers
and law enforcement officers (OK, he's not all bad :-) and dozens more were
murdered on his orders. He then bought political offices for his kids,
which is precisely what his colleagues - cocaine and heroin deales from
Cali, medellin, etc cartels - get blamed for in Mexico and Colombia.
