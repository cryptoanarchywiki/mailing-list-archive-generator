guy,

tough noogies

deal with it...

Notice the words "criminal investigations"? God forbid talent could
actually be used for a good cause. The incidents in question were actually
quite serious (Chinese mafia money laundering via phony real estate deals)
and not at all like the porno bbs confiscation crap you'd be thinking of.

Besides the DA office reference (I can completely understand about that
one), which was consulting work, what's your point in laying someone's life
out on a page? Who cares? Yeah, its a lot of stuff, I just happen to work
for start-up companies and thus I jump around a lot - given that most of
them never make it due to one problem or another.

:)
