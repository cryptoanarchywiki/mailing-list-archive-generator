  Dear NetCenter Member:

Thank you for requesting information about VeriSign Digital IDs from Netscape's
Netcenter.  A VeriSign Digital ID provides a means of proving your identity in 
electronic transactions, much like a driver license or a passport does in 
face-to-face interactions.  By using your Verisign Digital ID you can:

  *Sign your e-mail.  Recipients are assured that the information they receive 
  is from you, and hasn't been altered in any way by outside tampering.   

  *Encrypt and decrypt e-mail.  This assures no one except the intended 
  recipient can view its contents. 

In addition:

VeriSign's new public directory is your "white pages" for Digital IDs. Look up
anyone's Digital ID. Then send and receive signed and encrypted e-mail --
all from within Netscape Messenger. (If you use another email package you can 
still easily access the directory from VeriSign's web site.)

Your browser will automatically store your Digital ID and present it for you at
participating sites.  This means no longer remembering multiple passwords to 
gain access to these sites.

You automatically receive the peace-of-mind of US $1,000 NetSure(sm) protection 
against economic loss caused by corruption, loss or misuse of your Digital ID 
(not available with free trial ID). 

For more information about Digital IDs and how they are used, please visit 
http://www.verisign.com/products/individual/index.html.
To enroll for a VeriSign Class 1 Digital ID, please complete the form below, 
read our Subscriber Agreement, then click the Accept button.  If you are not 
using Netscape Mail, you may not be able to view the form below.  Please visit 
our Digital ID Center at http://digitalid.verisign.com/class1Netscape.htm to 
enroll for your free Class 1 Digital ID.

                Singapore
                South Africa

                United Kingdom 
                United States
                Other Countries
                
    
        
        
        





        
        
        
        Zip or postal code:
        

        
        
        
        
        





        
        
        
        Date of birth:(MMDDYYYY)
        

        
        
        
        (Example: 12251966)

STEP 3: Choose a Challenge Phrase




        A challenge phrase enables you to cancel and replace your Digital ID (i.e., if you change computers, software, etc). The challenge phrase is only known by you and should be kept in a safe place - you must have it to cancel your Digital ID if it is compromised or stolen.




        

        Challenge phrase:
        

        
        
        
        No punctuation, please.



        

        





STEP 4: Choose Full Service Class 1 Digital ID or 60 day Free Trial


	
	A full service Digital ID comes with these features:
        
        Send and receive secure e-mail (via S/MIME)
        Replaces passwords and enables one-step registration at participating websites
        VeriSign Customer Care, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
        Automatic Enrollment in $1,000 
        NetSureSM Protection Plan 
        Free replacement and revocation of your Digital ID should it be lost or corrupted
                
        


	
      
        I'd like a full service  Digital ID for only US$9.95. (Please complete Step 5.)

        I'd like to test drive a 60-day trial Digital ID for free. (does not include revocation, replacement, the NetSure Protection Plan or premium customer care)
       






STEP 5: Finalize Enrollment



  Your Digital ID is valid for a one year period. Your credit card will be charged US$9.95 when you click the Accept button below. All enrollment and credit card information is transmitted securely using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.  This information is kept confidential and is not included in your Digital ID.

         Visa
