 ... not so .... the US Military has very few really experienced
combat soldiers left and most of those are in places where their
experience isn't available to the grunt on the line. Most RVN vets are
retired ... look just recently at what happened to the Russians troops
sent to Chechnya ... all these brand spanking new, highly trained
proud young 19 and 20 year old troops went romping off to fight 'a
bunch of old men' in the Chechyn Republic ... there was one little
problem ... a big hunk of those old men had spent two to seven years
in that same Russian Army fighting the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan ...
and that 'bunch of old men' kicked their young asses!
