A bunch of us cryptographers would really like to attack RPK, but the
documents on the website are slippery enough to make it difficult.  There
is enough unspecified for them to sneak away from any analysis.

If someone were to reverse engineer the RPK cryptosystem from this product,
I would really appreciate it.
