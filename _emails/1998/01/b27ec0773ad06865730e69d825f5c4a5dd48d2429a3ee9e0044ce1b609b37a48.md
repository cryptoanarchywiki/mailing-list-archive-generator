I might look at it like air conditioning in a car:  If present, it requires
significant alterations to the basic vehicle, and might be difficult to remove
cleanly, _but_ air conditioning in no way affects the basic operation of the
car, and cars can be bought without air conditioning.

Hmmmmm, actually A/C does affect the car's operation: uses more gas and 
degrades performance!  A better metaphor than I thought.
