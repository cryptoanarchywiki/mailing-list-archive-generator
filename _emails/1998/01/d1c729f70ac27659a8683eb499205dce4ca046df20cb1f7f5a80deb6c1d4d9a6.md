Anyone who would tell their dying wife, via their son, to wait a moment
until he had finished his calculations is not a nice person.

What the hell are you talking about here? I made no such claims at all.

Lobashevski was the first person to write in modern history on non-euclidean
geometry. Gauss was a contemporary and was quite familiar with Lobashevski's
work. He was even asked to review "The Theory of Parallels". Gauss, in an
uncharacteristic act, even admitted that Lobachevski's work had progressed
farther than his own.

Gauss did a lot of harm as well. He characteristicaly denied works of others
and trivialized their contributions while at the same time promoting his
own. He was prone to bouts of drunken anger and is known to have physicaly
attacked quite a few people while in that state. His usual treatment of
contemporaries was based on contempt, not respect.

Bolyai's father worked with Gauss (as I explained) and his son John also
worked with Gauss from the time he (Bolyai) was in school; not Gauss.

I am going to refrain from going on with the remainder of your 'points'.
You have strayed so far afield, as usual, or misconstrued comments that it
has no relevance to what the original discussion was about, which was science
advances when people publish and share their work - not when it is held back
and unpublished.
