This legislation was passed in the Apollo era, and gave the government the
right to quarantine vehicles and personnel which had come in contact with
anything not of terrestrial origin.  It was aimed at writing into law a
legal right for NASA to engage in the type of isolation procedures done
after the first moon landing, and was not passed with UFOs in mind.

It's on the Web somewhere, but I don't recall the URL.
