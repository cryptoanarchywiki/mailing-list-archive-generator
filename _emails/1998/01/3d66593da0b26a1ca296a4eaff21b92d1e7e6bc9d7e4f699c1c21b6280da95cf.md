It's more incriminating to prove you sent a request for illicit data than
you downloaded it. Sending it out shows premeditated intent. Simply
downloading it shows only curiosity with no other evidence. Simple traffic
analysis will determine your sourcing data even if it is fully encrypted.

I point my local news readers at my ISP's news server so I don't flood my
link with several gig's of traffic a day. This is the primary objection to
hosting a 'real' local news server - the bandwidth and hardware resource
issues place it outside of most peoples financial ability.
