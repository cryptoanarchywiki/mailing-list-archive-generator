>From a purist point of view the Intel Pentium processors are good 
performance pieces.  The main problem with the Cyrix/IBM is very poor 
math coprocessor performance.  The average user may never notice the 
difference but the tests and real life use of Quake show that the 
Cyrix/IBM is not of the same standard as the Pentium.

I have a Intel 166MMX labelled processor running just fine at 225 Mhz 
(75 Mhz X 3).  You can't do the same thing with Cyrix/IBM processors, 
maybe you can over-clock them one step.  I am a keen fan of 
competition in the marketplace and I have two Cyrix/IBM processors in 
the systems in my home.  I have not tried the AMD Pentium class 
processors but I intend to buy one in the near future just to play 
around with it.  In the past AMD was the king of over-clocking and 
did things with the 486 chip that Intel could not, or chose not to.  
I hope AMD again gains that distinction with their Pentium class 
processors.  

Maybe Tim May has the real inside scoop on the AMD K6 processors.  
Certain segments of the market are commiting resources to the AMD K6 
and you should see as many in the market as AMD can produce.  Tim 
May's comments on yield problems at AMD could be very true as 
resellers are having a problem acquiring  AMD K6s processors.
