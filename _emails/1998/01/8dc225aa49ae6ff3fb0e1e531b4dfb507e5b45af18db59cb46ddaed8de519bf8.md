I guess I'm over my head in such matters.  From my, admitedly, shallow
understanding of wave function collapse, etc., I was under the apparent
misimpression that once collapsed (e.g., by Alice entangling a 'modulation'
photon M (of a known polarization) with one member (photon A) of an
entangled pair, one of which was sent to Alice and the other (photon B)
which was sent to Bob, photon B's polarization state was determined and
could not subsequently be altered by Bob's measurement with his receiver.
Could you recommend a good article which explain this paradox to a
non-quantum mechanic?
