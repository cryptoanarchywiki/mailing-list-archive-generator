>    NEW YORK (CNNfn) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday it
>    would no longer try to hold up Intel Corp.'s $420 million acquisition
>    of Chips and Technologies Inc.
>    [INLINE] The FTC did say, however, that it would continue to
>    investigate the merger as part of its more extensive look into Intel's
>    operations. Earlier, the FTC had sought a preliminary injunction to
>    halt the merger.
>    [INLINE] The FTC was apparently concerned that Intel would gain an
>    even larger market share of the chip market with the acquisition of
>    Chips and Technologies, a leading laptop computer semiconductor firm.
>    [INLINE] The FTC has been eyeing Intel carefully because it believes
>    that Intel's strong chip business, estimated to control more than 80
>    percent of the world's market, could raise antitrust concerns.
