Well

Well it was during Cuban Missile Crisis that the small pimple-sized 
Island brought us to the highest state of Def-Com ever (one level before
actually launching an attack).

At that point it time it was deadly serious; fortunately JFK and Krucheiv 
(sorry for murdering the spelling) where able to work something out and
avoid a catastrophe.
