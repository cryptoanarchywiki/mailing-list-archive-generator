Who also worked with Gauss and probably beat Gauss to any solution to the
problem of non-euclidean geometry (see Kurzer Grundriss eines Versuchs, 
p. 46).

Actualy his father published it as an afterthought to get him to quit
working on Euclids Parallels. It was published in Tomus Secundus (1833,
pp. 265 - 322) written by his father.

Both John Bolyai's "The Science of Absolute Space" and Nicholas
Lobachevski's "The Theory of Parallels" are included in Roberto Bonola's
"Non-euclidean Geometry" (Dover, ISBN 0-486-60027-0 $5.50). I certainly had
no problem reading the 3 combined books.

I was just looking at the translators notes to Lobachevski, it was done
by George Bruce Halsted of 2407 San Marcos St, Austin, Tx. May 1, 1891.

Not true, Bolyai wrote him several letters as described in his book and the
various prefaces. Lobachevski's book was promoted by Gauss as the first and
truely critical work on non-euclidean geometry. In a rare show of magnamity
Gauss even admits that Lobachevski's work exceeded his own.

He wrote a classic work on non-euclidean geometry that was quite popular in
1912 when it was printed.
