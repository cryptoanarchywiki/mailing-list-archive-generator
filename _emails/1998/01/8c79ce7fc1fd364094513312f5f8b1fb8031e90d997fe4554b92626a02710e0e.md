I'm not sure I am convinced by this argument.

The "enemy within" seems to be the main focus of the discussions in the CP
list. When the 'luckless squad that happens your way' is manned by your
countrymen at the command of their (and your) government, what then? Will
you still attempt to defeat the 'occupying army'?

As far as I can see, the result would be a *very* bloody civil war. The
outcome may indeed be less obvious than in a 'conventional' (i.e. unarmed
populace) civil war, but the cost much higher.

Bear in mind that this is from the standpoint of a 'sissy' European. I
admit I am poorly equipped to comment on the American Zeitgeist. However,
my experience of civil war victims (extensive contact with refugees from
the E-bloc) suggests to me that we should be concentrating on social
revolution before we tool up for a military one. There is more to be won,
with a potentially much lower cost.

By all means buy the hardware, that is after all your right. Just spare the
hero talk. *Everyone* thinks they'll be one of the survivors in a war, just
as 95% of the population believe they have an above average IQ.

My understanding of the word 'revolution' in this context means realigning
the opinions of the governments and peoples around the globe to allow
freedoms such as those supported by Cypherpunks to be freely available. An
example of this is to work against the misinformation spread by 'them'
which leads the average Joe (dumb or not) to think that 'Encrypted Data =
Child Porn/Drug Barons planning something big/More child porn'.
