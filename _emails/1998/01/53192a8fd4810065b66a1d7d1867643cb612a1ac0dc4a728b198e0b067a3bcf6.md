Given strong cryptography and something like my current Eternity DDS
almost prototype (a reliable distributed way of selling 
storage-compute-bandwidth being the relevant part), why couldn't the 
incarcerated person have left an agent out on the net to handle the 
challenge for him, and hold the money in anonymous trust for him until
he gets out?  I can't think of any anonymity-preserving system which 
contains an "is-a-person" predicate -- even if you asked an AI-hard
question, you could blind the question and post it to usenet or CNN
or something and quote one of those responses (which would be wise to
do anyway for styleometry prevention).

The other option is having a non-anonymous system, or one that is
anonymous until someone tries to collect the prize, but in that case,
it's not all that interesting a problem.
