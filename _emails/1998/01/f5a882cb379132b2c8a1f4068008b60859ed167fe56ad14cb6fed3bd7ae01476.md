I wasn't commenting on the legality, but on the fact that the USPS web page
was making the claim that it was a crime.  Apparently whoever wrote the
legal disclaimer felt that email could be misdelivered in the same fashion
in which postal mail could be misdelivered and was making this claim.  I
found the claim to be nutty and made me think they didn't know what they
were doing.
