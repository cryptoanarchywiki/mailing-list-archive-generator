I've copied the HTML'd version at http://www.slimy.com/crypto/cyphernomicon/.
Barring catastrope, it'll stay there until the singularity.

Another model would be advertising supported.  In this model, a business
collects important documents, sources, and so on, and makes them generally
available.  A search engine at the site home helps index it, and provides
banner advertisements as well.

The advertisement supported model works for the search engines, and this
would have the advantage of avoiding both broken links and useless drivel.
Free access and free submission may be necessary to get both enough
documents and users to be profitable.
