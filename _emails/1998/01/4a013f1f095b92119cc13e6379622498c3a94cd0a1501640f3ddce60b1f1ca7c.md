This issue was covered in _The Right to Privacy_ by Ellen Alderman and
Carolyn Kennedy.  The book was misplaced during my recent move, and I didn't
get very far through it.  I do remember that the current legal standard for
invasion of privacy depended upon whether the information was gathered from
a public medium.  A psychiatric evaluation or Telco records would not be
considered a public forum, so could not be used by an employer (unless the
evaluation was given by the employer, I guess).  A web page, on the other hand
is about as public as you can get.

I would agree that with the right technologies (proxies, remailers, etc) there
would be a de facto protection of privacy, and (insert the not-even-close-to-
a-lawyer disclaimer here) that there should be some legal basis that since
the effort was made to hide the True Name, the content could not be used, if
there were a compromise.  Looks like a win-win.

It still doesn't deal with morons who *provide* their employers with the 
ammo to terminate employment.  You can make a system foolproof, but you can't
make it damnfoolproof.
