This isn't really the list for that sort of thing.
While Rand is partially correct, the big industrialization of the US
came from the railroad business opening the West, which depended
on killing off the Indians who lived there - in large part by
wiping out the buffalo herds and starving the people,
and by using the US Army to kill them, and granting large
chunks of the land to the railroads, not only enough right of
way for tracks, but typically several miles on each side.
Here in Northern California, the Gold Rush was simplified by
killing off the local tribes in gold country.

And much of the early industrialization in New England was
cotton mills, processing slave-grown cotton.
