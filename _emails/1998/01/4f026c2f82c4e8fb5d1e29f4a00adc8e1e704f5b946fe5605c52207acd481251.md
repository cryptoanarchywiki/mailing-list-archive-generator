(I didn't see anyone comment on my posting under "Re: remailer resistancs to attack", so I thought I'd repost under this thread.  My apologies for any inconvience.)

Came across this paper and thought it might contribute to improving remailer reliability, "How to Maintain Authenticated Communication in the Presence of Break-ins," http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~tcryptol/OLD/old-02.html
