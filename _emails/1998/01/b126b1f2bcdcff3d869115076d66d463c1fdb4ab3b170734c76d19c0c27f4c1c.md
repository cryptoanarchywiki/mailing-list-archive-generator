I really hate having to go over and over basic points, but will do in the 
hope of bringing even a tiny glimmer of enlightenment to you:

If you don`t want to serve food to blacks, open and restaurant and refuse 
to serve blacks in it, put a sign on the door saying "whites only, 
no niggers please", if blacks try to force you to serve them in your 
restaurant protect your rights by killing them. Simple as that.

Dumping toxic waste in my back yard will kill my neighbours.
How does refusing to hire blacks or any other group harm anyone but 
myself (in terms of trade levels)?

On the contrary it is an entirely analagous situation, someone is 
choosing not to associate with you, do you go crying to the govt. 
claiming you didn`t get a fair shake because sarah in accounts wouldn`t 
fuck you at the office christmas party?

> With freedom comes responsibility.  Decency is one of them.

With freedom comes responsibility not to infringe someone elses rights, I 
infringe no-one elses rights by refusing to hire them...
