There are alternative ways of paying for the service that do not in
any way depend on ecash, and after thinking about it a bit, they seem
more robust, as well. 

The basic idea is as follows:  The fundamental eternity service is 
free to readers, and is financed entirely by writers.  The writers 
supply the disk space, the network bandwidth, and possibly pay for 
the software to support all this.

In a little more detail: you have say 1 megabyte of data that you
would like to be stored in the Eternity Service.  The overhead of
storage in eternity is a factor of two, and you would like 10 times
redundancy.  So you contact the Eternity Service Software provider, and 
get the software.  You then configure the software to supply 20 
megabytes of your disk space to the system.  This allows you to 
supply 1 meg of your own data.

The 20 megs will of course not store *your* data -- it will store
other eternity data.  The service takes your data and spreads it
across 10 other sites, whose locations are unknown and unknowable to
you.  In return, you are storing eternity data for other users.  If
your disk space becomes unavailable your file disappears from the
service.  (Of course, someone else could pick it up and store it, if
it was valuable information.)

This is a self-financing model.  Every writer to the eternity service
pays for their own bandwidth and disk space.  The eternity service
provider is financed by maintaining the software that all the writers
use -- client/server software will have to run on many different
platforms, some protocols may be better than others, and it might be 
worth buying your eternity software from a high-reputation 
("trustworthy") provider.

Note that this doesn't mean that data suppliers can't be paid for
providing data -- but that is a completely separable problem that can
have many different solutions.

I believe this approach does solve the financing part.  But it does
make the rest a *very* complicated problem -- you have a dynamic,
self-configuring network of data sources and sinks, with all the
configuration data encrypted along with the data.  Ideally, of course,
the data would be migrating constantly. 

Retrieval would probably be very slow -- basically email speeds, or 
worse.  In fact, perhaps the data would be retrieved by having the 
eternity service use the remailer network to send it...
