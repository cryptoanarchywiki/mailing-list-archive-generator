 Maybe they are confusing an electronic mailbox with a snailmail box ... 
the USPS has always contended that they (the USPS) "own" your mailbox and 
use that criterion to prosecute people who drive around putting things 
like circulars etc in mailboxes. Maybe they we on a role thinking that if 
they got into the e-mail business they would 'own' that piece of your 
hard drive so to speak.

The Windows PC Versus Macintosh Buying Decision:	
  "If you want to encourage your kids to color outside the lines, think 
  creatively and zig when the other kids zag, get the Mac. On the other 
  hand, if you want to teach your kid that life if full of frustration 
and 
  that anything worth getting takes plenty of patience and hard work, a 
  Windows machine should do quite nicely."
