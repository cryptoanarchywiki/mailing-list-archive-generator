Hi,

The question was asked why mixing acids and bases are hazardous. Please
note number 5 below. When an acid and base are mixed you get water and a
salt. When water is added to acid (ie pouring a base into an acid) the heat
of reaction can cause the water to get quite hot and cause the chemicals
to splatter upon you. The idea is you want the acid to disolve in the water
and not the other way around. Goggles, bibs, and all other reasonable safety
precautions should always be used.

> ORGANIC CHEMISTRY LABORATORY SAFETY RULES
> 
>      * 1. Maintain a business-like attitude. Be prepared! Do not attempt
>        unauthorized experiments.
>      * 2. Wear safety goggles (eye protection) at all times when in the
>        laboratory. This is a departmental and state regulation. Do not
>        eat or drink in the lab or bring food or drink into the lab.
>      * 3. Know the location and use of the nearest fire extinguisher,
>        nearest First Aid kit, nearest eye wash station, nearest safety
>        shower, and nearest exit designated for evacuation. Know the
>        location of the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and know that
>        you have access to them. Know the NFPA (National Fire Protection
>        Association) Hazardous Material Classification Codes.
>      * 4. Report any accident, even minor injuries, to the instructor at
>        once.
>      * 5. When diluting acids, pour acid slowly and carefully into the
>        water with constant stirring. Use Pyrex and Kimax glassware and
>        NEVER add water to acid. Rinse acid or base Penny-Head stoppered
>        bottles under the faucet after each use.
>      *
>    6. In the event that acid, base, or any corrosive liquid is spilled on
>        your person:
>        a) Flush immediately with running water at the sink. Call for
>        instructor.
>        b) Rinse area with 5% sodium bicarbonate solution.
>        c) Wash area with soap and water, blot dry with clean towel or
>        handkerchief.
>        d) Follow direction of lab supervisor. Check MSDS if you have
>        questions.
>      * 7. In case of an organic chemical spilled on your person, flush
>        with water, wash with soap, rinse with water, rinse with ethyl
>        alcohol, wash with soap, and rinse with water. Pat dry. Wash hands
>        before and after visiting toilet. Check MSDS if you have
>        questions.
>      * 8. Never taste chemicals or solutions. Minimize the inhalation of
>        organic vapors by using the smallest amounts of materials and
>        utilizing the hood as much as possible. Check MSDS if you have
>        questions.
>      * 9. Many organic compounds are either carcinogenic, mutagenic,
>        and/or teratogenic. Generally avoid aromatic amines and nitroso
>        compounds. Review the document on Chemical Exposure in Organic
>        Chemistry. Check the MSDS if you are not adequately aware of the
>        compound's properties.
>      * 10. In case of cuts or punctures, flush with running water, and
>        call for instructor or see stock room attendant on third floor for
>        First Aid. All punctures should be seen by the university nurse or
>        a physician!
>      * 11. Dispose of all wastes properly. Read labels on bottles! Keep
>        bench and floor clean.
>      * 12. Before leaving the laboratory, be sure that the water, steam,
>        heaters, and gas cocks are shut off.
