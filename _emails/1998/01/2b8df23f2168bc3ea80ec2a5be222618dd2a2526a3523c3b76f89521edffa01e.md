Which one was it? I had the privilege of working on the IBM Leonardo
exhibit when it was in Austin at Discovery Hall about 10 years ago. Part of my
duties was to repair two of his models (the 'turtle' tank & his composite
ship hull design) and got a real appreciation of his skills.

There was a show on one of the cable science shows about Leonardo week before
last. You might want to review your schedule and catch it. I found it quite
entertaining and educational.
