You must find the advertising business completely mystifying, then.

You pay to have your data disseminated in a form that you can be later
paid -- for example, leave the juciest part of the data in encrypted
form, along with a public key through which payment options can be
negotiated.

Why on earth do you try to be an ISP, then?  You pay for disk drives 
for other people to store their data, and make it available to the 
world.  The eternity service is actually very similar.

Given a protocol such as I described, you could move to Data Haven
Island, and charge up front to supply pornographers with an entrance
to the eternity service, while John Young could wallow in righteous
ego gratification as he provides space for morally important documents
by donating his disk space to eternity.  You do it for the money, he
does it for the buzz -- there are all kinds of ways to get paid.
