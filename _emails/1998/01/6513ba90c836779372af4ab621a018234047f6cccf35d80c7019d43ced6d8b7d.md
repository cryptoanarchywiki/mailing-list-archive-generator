My experience with libraries is that they subscribe to the entire paper.
Place it in their archives and then at some time in the future micro-fiche
the whole paper. I have never seen a library that picked and chose what
got archived in their paper morgue's. I have done research on newspapers
going all the way back to the civil war, I have yet to find one that wasn't
archived in toto, ads and all.

True but the point was that the data these short ads point to is *not*
archived by the same entity or necessarily any entity.

Is your webpage being archived by your local library? I be the New York
Times is.

Your going to compress 100 cypherpunks 64-bit keys (I prefer 128-bit) down
to 64 characters without data loss? I wanna see *that* compression algorithm.
