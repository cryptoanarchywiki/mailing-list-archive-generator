Hi,

I was exchangin idea with a couple of members off-list and an idea came to
me about how to time stamp the frames. It would require a minor modification
to the WWV transmission but it wouldn't be much. Have the WWV transmitters
sign each 'tick' of the clock and have a WWV receiver in the vcr. This would
allow time stamping the frame with a signed reference that could be checked.
