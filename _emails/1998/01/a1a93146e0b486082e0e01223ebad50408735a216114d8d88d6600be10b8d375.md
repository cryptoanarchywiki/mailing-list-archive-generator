I used Alta Vista's Translation Service at
http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate? and selected the
"Youngspeak to English" option, with this slightly more comprehensible
result:

"There vetting, but mawky pretexts swing the censor indeed cousins seem to
load haywire in order to hold the furious purchase. Isn't that a legacy
Brit, also?"

I think it is saying something about how our British cousins get furious
when then have to buy censored legacy applications and the slithey toves
did gyre and gimble in the wabe.
