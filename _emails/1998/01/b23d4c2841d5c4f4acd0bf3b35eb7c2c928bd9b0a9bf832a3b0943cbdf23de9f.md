We're awful testy tonite aren't we...believe me junior, if I want to jump in
your shit I'll do it direct first person and in your face. Since it seems to
have got stuck in your craw, I apologize for not asking you the correct
usage of your name prior to typing it into my reply. In the future I
think I'll use 'that crazy indipendently wealthy ex-Intel technologist
and self-important testy gun nut that lives in California who almost got to
see John Denvers plane crash'; is *that* ok with you?

(not really, I think my fingers would cramp)

Unfortunately, for you, I never made that claim (if anything you did
regarding some comments I made about some police snipers liking .308's) and
therefore you didn't get to refute it. Whatever strategy you're on regarding
drugs and alcohol, reverse it; the dementia are back.

Been there before, I won't loose any sleep that is for shure.

Certainly not directly, but considering your background and past comments it
is an assumption that is justified. You most certainly feel qualified to
discuss the distinctions and consequences thereof.

Me, I consider myself a scientist and have since I was about 6 years old.
