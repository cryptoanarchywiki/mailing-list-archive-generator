Why limit your annoyance to government scientists?  Scientists
in private industry are in the same position, developing (e.g.)
algorithms and analytical methods protected by trade secrets.
Society recognizes this tendency and tries to advance science
anyway by offering patent protection.  You don't make money by
giving away your intellectual capital.  Seems to me that schools
and independently wealthy scientists/foundations are the only
ones who don't merit your censure on this count.
