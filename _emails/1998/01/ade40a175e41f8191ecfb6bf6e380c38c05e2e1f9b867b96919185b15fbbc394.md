I was always of the understanding that the mandate for regulation of radio
and television broadcasts had to do centrally with the "allocation of
scarce resources." That is, that because there are only a finite number of
non-overlapping spectrum slots, some degree of regulation or allocation is
justified.

(I'm not saying I support this, just that this was the argument for the FCC
and related regulatory measures.)

The Internet is not constrained by a finite number of slots...capacity can
be added arbitrarily (well, at least for as many decades out as we can
imagine). And consumers can, and do, pick what they choose to download or
connect to.

The Internet is about pure speech, about publishing.  For the Gore
Commission to even _hint_ at regulating it is reprehensible.

Just because the Internet can deliver audio and video signals is hardly a
matter of "allocating scarce resources." Video rental stores can also
deliver video signals, but there is no (well, modulo the "obscenity" laws
in various communities) regulation of these sources.
