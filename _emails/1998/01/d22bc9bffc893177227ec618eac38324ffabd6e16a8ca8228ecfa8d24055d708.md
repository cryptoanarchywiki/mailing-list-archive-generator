There was a guy in Florida, Cuban by nationality, who had been unable to
get US citizenship and was due to be deported. A couple of MIT students,
who had heard about this guy and were after a lark, hopped a plane down to
Florida and took this guy to a tatoo studio. What they tatooed on to him
was the DES algorithm, in some computer readable form. Thus rendering the
guy unexportable. The US government offered to scrape the tatoos off, but
they guy's lawyers screamed something about human rights abuses.  The way I
heard it, the guy was eventually granted citizenship.
