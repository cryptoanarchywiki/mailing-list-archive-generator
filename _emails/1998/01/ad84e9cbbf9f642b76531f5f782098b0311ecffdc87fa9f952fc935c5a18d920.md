It's especially a problem for them because email is replacing a lot
of Express Mail, Fedex, and similar higher-priced services,
so profits get hit harder.  

The phone companies are having the same problem - while voice over
the Internet isn't making much of a dent, expensive international calling
has a lot of fax traffic that's easy to turn into email.
And the Web is replacing a lot of 800-number calling
for information services from companies, which are also
a higher-profit part of the business.
