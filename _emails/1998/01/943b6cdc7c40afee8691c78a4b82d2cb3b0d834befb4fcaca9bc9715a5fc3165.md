Why the focus on color, the easiest thing to avoid using,
or layers, ditto? Superfluous for serious CAD, these 
dainty decorations from Martha Stewartville.

Most messages could be concealed in "hatched" objects,
bit-bloated as they are, indistinguishable from the elements
used to hatch. All black and white; maybe a dot of red for
cashmere dupe.

In fact, CAD is so bloated with dumb cad-jockey features,
and sleazebag work-monitoring logs, it puts most ordinary 
programs (even air-boss MS) to shame, and could hide a 
herd of rustled Mex longhorns as easily as the Bush family 
hides dryhole oil reserves, without any more trickery than 
sandpapering new boots to look worn.

Anyway, Jim, I gather from your remarks that you've not fiddled
for endless low-paid months and years to figure out how to
cheat the evil bosses and automatic work-snoop feature,
while onion-siphoning the Net for horny fare under guise of 
urgent file transfer to foam-mouth ne'erpays.

Underground (so to speak) swapping of digital work avoidance
tips is a huge use of global bandwidth riding on the backs
of big fat docs for globular structures for maggoty thugs.

(Although not nearly as gigantic as the porn trade stego-supporting 
Net infrastructre growth -- over 50% of Net traffic and rocketing.)

Who knows how much illicit info is riding the porn river in and
out of the most secure sanctums of tyrants?
