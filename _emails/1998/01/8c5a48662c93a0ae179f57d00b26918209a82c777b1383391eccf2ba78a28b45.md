Or maybe a rental truck and a portable storage space.
One of Microsoft's big problems is that if what you want to do is
haul big stuff from place to place, you don't care what brand of truck/car
you use to pull your U-Haul Brand trailer, and similarly if what
you want to use is a Web browser with a Java engine that runs
platform-independent Java apps, you don't care if it's running on
Win95, Linux, SunOS, NintendoJava, or MacNeXTsTep.
So they want to sell you that Pickup-mounted camper that
only fits on a big Microsoft pickup-truck, as well as selling you
some GlueOn Fuzzy Dice that can't be uninstalled cleanly from rental
cars so you just buy the truck from them.
And they want to give you Internet Exploiter free, so you're stuck with
Fuzzy-Dice-Compliant Windows, rather than letting you get used
to Java-based browsers that run on anything. 
				Thanks!
