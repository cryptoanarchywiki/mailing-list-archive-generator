AOLserver (formerly GNN's NaviServer) has better RDBMS integration features
than the apache crowd.  Phil Greenspun's site, www.photo.net, uses roughly
the same software I'm using (I asked him for advice, he swayed me from
Apache to AOLserver).  Once Apache has better Oracle integration, I might
go back to it, since I do like having source to as much as possible, but
right now, being able to easily and efficiently link Oracle to the web
server is a bit more important than source or simple to implement SSL.
