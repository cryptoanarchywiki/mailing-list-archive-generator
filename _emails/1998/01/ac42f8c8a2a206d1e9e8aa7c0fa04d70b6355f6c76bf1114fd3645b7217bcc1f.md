EFF has published an unofficial transcript of the hearing in front of
three judges at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on
December 8.  The hearing discussed whether the export controls on
cryptography are an unconstitutional prior restraint on publication.
See

There is no news on the judges' decision from that hearing.
