The actual transportation of the state is instantanious as it must be by
quantum theory, just as the change in orbits of an electron occurs instantly.
However, the catch is that the command/synchronization channel must be
sent in parallel and it at some point can't use the quantum transportation
technique and hence the speed-of-light comes back into play. This was
specificaly discussed in the original quantum transportation announcement
sent out by AIP.
