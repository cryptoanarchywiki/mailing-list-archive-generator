The Washington Post reported Jan. 30th that Prince George County (where 
dat?) police are collecting spit and fingerprints, not only from every 
suspect they interview in connection with the rape and murder of a nurse-
administrator, but also from all 400 male hospital employees at the hospital 
the victim formerly worked at.

The spit's for DNA testing and the fingerprints are just for the helluva
it I guess.

It's just a request mind you. If you refuse, you won't necessarily be con-
sidered a suspect but the information you supply 'would certainly be under
scrutiny' according to the Chief Thug of Prince George County.

Oh! The 4th amendment? That dusty old thing? When the scumbags are kicking
in your door which would you rather have protecting you: a raggedy old
piece of paper or a Prince George County Mountie SWAT team in full ninja
dress and the latest high-tech law-enforcement goodies? Thought so. Cup's
at the end of the counter comrade. Have a nice day.
