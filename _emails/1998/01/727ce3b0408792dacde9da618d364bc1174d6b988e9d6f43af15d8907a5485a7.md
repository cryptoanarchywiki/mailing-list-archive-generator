uh huh
but we have a problem. I thought "technology is neutral".
hmmmmm, maybe technology != science.....?

interesting book on this a friend told me about: "toxic 
sludge is good for you" -- describes for example
how many oil companies are creating an effective *facade* 
based on very aggressive PR campaigns.

if anyone wants good info on the state of our times, and
how our government has been hijacked.... check this one
out. it shows that as savvy as "you" think you are
(you is anybody here), we're all living in a gingerbread
fantasy world created by the mass media-- even when you're
not tuned into it.
