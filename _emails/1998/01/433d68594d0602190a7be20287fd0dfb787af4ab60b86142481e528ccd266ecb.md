No working model has been deployed by me as of yet.  However, most of the
components are "solved problems", with existing working models.  Worst case,
it would be possible to accomplish equivalent functionality by linking
these by remailers and hoping no one shuts down the remailers.

I believe no one has seriously called to pour money into remailers because 
there
is no money to be made from them, and making them commercial exposes them to
additional pressure and liability, not because they are technically poorly 
designed.

It's not a database.  A technical design document describing it, security
assumptions made, and implementation guidelines has been under development.  I 
have
been working on small demonstration components only in order to test ideas -- I
have identified technical problems which are essential to an Eternity 
implementation, and I have been looking into literature for solutions.  In
some areas, no good solutions exist in research, so I've been trying to
find technical solutions.

A full discussion is included in a document which has not yet been released.  
It's
not finished, even in draft form.  Classes and leaving the country to talk to 
people
and work on a side project got in the way of finishing it.  Once a draft is 
done,
I'm planning to release it to a small set of people, get their comments, then
finish the demo and send it to the cypherpunks community, with a pointer to the
demo.  I do not want to release a half-finished draft for fear that then 
progress will
slow to a standstill on the unfinished parts.

I don't believe in the protection of being in "speech space" vs. being
in network space as substantially different.  Extralegal means will be
used to shut down servers in either case, if it is sufficiently important
to the attackers.

It does not necessarily reduce the number of nodes and links (it may for
a given amount of traffic).

Yes, a mathematical and technical model is critical.  However, certain
technical questions not directly related to security are easiest to solve by
experiment.

>
Yes, this is true.  I've prepared a list of goals and assumptions -- I will
post them at some point in the near future.  Debate over them would be more
fruitful than any technical debate at this point.

If every single machine in country A is shut down, then Eternity access to that
country fails.  This is why it is essential that all machines involved
in the network retain anonymity, both from users and from untrusted other
nodes.  Several methods exist for this, including a cellular structure, 
anonymous
writing by using remailers or other technical means, etc.

Components of the system will take their own security into account when pricing
service.  It won't necessarily be linear.  Since they have their own security 
in
mind, they will not willingly send a file which will lead to their demise 
unless
the reward for doing so is higher than the penalties of being caught.

That's the primary reason for having both a design document and a demo.  People
can read about how it should work, and attack it at that level, as well as look
at it in operation.

True.  I'm not coding a detailed implementation of a protocol, I'm doing a 
bunch
of minor experiments to see what technical means are feasible, as well as
trying to create something which lets people see how it works.

That's why I'm trying to design the service with security *and* commercial 
usability
in mind.  I believe there are plenty of commercial uses for something with the
right combination.  If something like Eternity DDS exists which is 
indistinguishable to
the user from a web server, and from those adding files from a system superior 
to a web
server (such as a database), yet provides the level of security which I hope 
to provide,
I think there will be a commercial market.

So, I guess in order of priority:
1) list of goals and assumptions for a commercially-viable eternity service,
with cypherpunks-level security, made available for discussion
2) technical design document to meet these goals circulated among
some subset of the community for initial sanity checking
3) functional demo prepared which can demonstrate the feasibility of the system
4) release of 2) and 3) to cypherpunks, eternity, etc. for commentary
5) repeat 2, 3, 4 as necessary
6) production implementation

I've been working on 1, 2, and 3 in parallel but with roughly correct 
distribution
of effort.
