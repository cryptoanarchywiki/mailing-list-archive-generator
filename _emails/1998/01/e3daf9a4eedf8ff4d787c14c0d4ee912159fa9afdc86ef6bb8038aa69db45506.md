If memory serves me right it was because Vince bounced off the Taxbomber
site because it offered second passports, camouflage passports, and other
products that was considered a fraud, Which to me sounds odd since there
is some other company selling most everthing and then some from an .ai
domain which Vince's company has the monopoly on handing out .ai domains

You also have to wonder how far in the future it will be before the
special forces of some banana republic drops in on Vince to blow-up
his operation for as he advertises publishing censored information 
on ones ex-president on the Internet, or for that matter I have
yet to see abortion information coming from his servers. 

What has happened in Anguilla proves that there will be a need for 
different flavors of datahavens, Different degrees libility that
datahaven owners will want to store information on their servers.  
I would love to open a XXX WWW site in Anguilla pulling in the 
industry average of $5-10K a month and not pay any taxes there, 
But it won't happen in Anguilla with the present adminstration!

Isn't there a microstate off the coast of England called 'Sealand' run
from a former oil rig/gun battery for the last 20 years?

I agree completely, But there is still room for massively distrubted
datahavens on oil rigs, barges, gun batteries, island nations or
hiding in Norm's LAN in Cicero IL.  All the harder to supress that
information.
