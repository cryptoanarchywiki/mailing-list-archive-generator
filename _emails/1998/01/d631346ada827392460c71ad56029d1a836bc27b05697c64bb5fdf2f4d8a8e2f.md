True enough, the question becomes who does that continued funding help the
most?

Really? What is the difference? Mallet attacks the server itself who has
only the resources available from the source, which I believe can assume
safely, which is obviously less than the resource set of those who could
actualy act upon or impliment the data under discussion.

Yes, at bargain basement prices that allow, if not even promote, a daddy
warbucks to walk in and up the ante above what the source can pay.

No, the source payment mechanism does not promote either server honesty
or long term existance of controversial data.

We're going round and round here, as I said earlier the views are
diametricaly opposite. I would suggest we drop this discussion and let us
see what happens over the next few years as it is clear that many people are
working on different implimentations. Let's let the market decide which
works best.
