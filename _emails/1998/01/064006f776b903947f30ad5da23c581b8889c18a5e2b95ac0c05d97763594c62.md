The NYT ad? I think that was at least partly a joke (besides, if some
cypherpunks did take out an ad, I'd predict propaganda in 2/3 of the page and
fine-print PGP-key fingerprints in the rest :).

> Where does this random user come from? 

Why does it matter? As long as she's competent enough to choose good verifiers
and verify that those verifiers verified the code in question, it all works out
in the end. 

> What is '(thresh)'? What good would an anonymous key signature provide? 

Thresh is the number of signatures from trusted people/keys required to trust a
section of code, a value set by the user. An anonymous sig would be very little
good but I think he was talking about including the author's sig if he's not
anonymous. 

> [...] How do we know that some number of these cypherpunks aren't turned? 

We don't. There is no way to operate without *some* trust; this reduces it from
the code being shown to be secure if the author is not spookized AND The author
is capable to check his/her code AND the key he signed it with is good to the
code being good if those conditions are true for one (or a few) of the many
cypherpunks on the user's trusted list who signed the code. 
	
> Are you proposing that the user test all 100 of the signatures? 

Well, I think he's proposing to have a script check them and the user
personally make sure the script is doing what it should.

Not to mention churning out that propaganda for the NYT ad, becoming tolerant
to pepper spray, preparing various fake identities for use, proving Blowfish
secure and then breaking it, constructing a doomsday weapon using only a
straightedge and compass, etc.

Might be, but this code has to be more than just understood -- it must be
painstakingly checked for subtle flaws and bugs. Welcome to the world of
adversarial quality control.

The C/Java/whatever compiler, I suppose, and also the signature checker, and
she's checking that they carry out their stated purposes.

I think the issue was one of users who want to get eternity server source they
can trust -- not necessarily getting it *from* Eternity.

Unless you're exposing a new weakness in the trust model PGP uses, Mallet can't
do that, providing the user has done good key authentication and hasn't listed
one of Mallet's goons as a trusted code-verifier.

Yup, that's why the user has to check it by hand. Lots easier to check a script
and a compiler for doing their functions than to check an eternity server for
subtle bugs.

Well, if you can't verify it yourself and you can't trust other people to
verify it, my advice is to give up; you cannot be sure of *any* public keys in
that case, so any message you encrypt might be encrypted to one of Mallet's
keys; any sig you check might be signed by one of Mallet's keys.

If Mallet is a NSA spook who's half as good as my hacker buddy Phat Atta and
knew about the script ahead of time, the user can't trust the script without
verifying it herself, whether it takes milliseconds or millenia to get the
response.

Ah, but either I am more mistaken than usual or you only need a few of the
signers to be trusted, not all of them.

Not sure, but I think he's talking about putting up a key server in Eternity
(i.e., the rolling hills where data can roam without fear, as opposed to
putting it in the Eternity).
