Assume that the mirrors completely surround the objects, and that the only
light source is IR thermal radiation, and that the mirrors are insulated
from the outsite world, so we can assume a closed system.

By the laws of optics, one focus should get warmer than the other, but by
the law of entropy they must remain at the same temperature.  That's the
paradox.
