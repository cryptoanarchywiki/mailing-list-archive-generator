Hello all,

>> "Swisscom has stored data on the movements of more than a million mobile
>> phone users. It can call up the location of all its mobile subscribers down
>> to a few hundred meters and going back at least half a year," the paper
>> reported.
>
>They probably say a few hundred meters so the people don't feel
>their privacy is too ridiculously invaded / soften the blow.
>
>If this is a GSM network then I think they can probably pinpoint
>your location down to 2 possible locations within a few meters
>due to the digital timing involved with the very precise spread
>spectrum radio. Or maybe your actual location within a meter or 2.
>
>I have heard of digital mobile phones that have a feature in their test/diag
>mode that displays the distance to the current base station in meters,
>and also displays info of a second base station that it would most likely
>switch to when moving out of the current cell.
>Even if the telco only had the distance info to your phone within a meter
>from 2 of their base stations, they could calculate where you are if need
>be to 2 possible locations within meters.
>Surely though they would have the capability of recording distance info
>from 3 base stations, pin pointing you exactly during a call or the exact
>spot your phone requested a cell change.
>
>And during a call, if need be, they could probably plot your position at
>around 10,000 samples per second.	:) Though for them to be keeping
>this much info on you, you are obviously being investigated.
>
>Isn't it ironic that people who use GSM for it's "security" can have this
>much info of their whereabouts known to big brother/whoever?
>Not to mention their actual conversation.
>
>Imagine Mr.Drug Dealer turns up to court and watches as the jury is
>presented with a floorplan on screen and an animated pinpoint of his
>phones position while a recording of his conversation is played in sync?
>
>The world just about, has no idea!
>To say big brother is watching is a gross understatement.	:)
>
>He's gunna find out who's naughty and nice.
>
>Bye for now.
