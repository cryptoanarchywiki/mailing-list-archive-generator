System load is the issue in this case. If a proxy becomes publicly known
the load it imposes on the system could quickly become gigantic. In
addition we found that people were setting up proxies on any old port,
sometimes causing all kinds of conflicts.

Our accounts are priced assuming light personal usage. Running servers on
our systems is negotiable.
