			       ARTICLE III. 
 
Section 2.  The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, 
arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties 
made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; -- to all Cases affecting 
Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; -- to all Cases of admiralty 
and maritime Jurisdiction; -- to Controversies between two or more States; -- 
between a State and Citizens of another State; -- between Citizens of 
different States; -- between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under 
Grants of different States; -- and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, 
and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects. 
	In all Cases, affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and 
Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall 
have original Jurisdiction.  In all other Cases before mentioned, the supreme 
Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such 
Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make. 
	The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be 
by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes 
shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial 
shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.
