However, if Alice has had my key for 6 months, and has verified the
signatures on 100 of my Cypherpunks posts, and my signature on GunzenBombs
Pyro-Technologies latest checks out, she can be pretty confident that I
actually signed it.  On the other hand, if she didn't already have it, and
got a fake key and document from Mallet, Alice would not be able to use the
fake key to verify the signatures on my prior Cypherpunks posts.  This
ought to be a red-flagged clue that something is rotten in Denmark...
