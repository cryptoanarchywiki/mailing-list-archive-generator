There is at least one way to do it with standard equipment, course it must
be 1-way only. The source takes the phone line from their standard 4800
modem and put it in the audio in (both should be 600 ohm, be shure to use a
matching transformer for isolation). At the other end you do the same sort
of thing but use the modem to decode the data. You can not have full-duplex
with this method, half-duplex only.

Yeah, another radio, a map, a ruler & pen, a omni-directional antenna, and a
car. Check out the ARRL for various antenna designs.
