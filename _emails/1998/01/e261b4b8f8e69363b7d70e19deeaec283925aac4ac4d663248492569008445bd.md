Jim, there are > 2 parties in the matter being discussed:  the author of
the item (who wishes to remain anonymous), the person who wishes to use the
item (who probably wishes to remain anonymous), and N
reviewers/authenticators of the item, who may or may not wish to be
anonymous.  In the case of the reviewers, signature verification may be
possible outside of the BlackNet/Eternity structure.  For example, I could
look at the source for Joes Awesome CryptoKillerApp, or the latest manual
from GunzenBomz Pyro-Technologies, and sign the files indicating that I
cannot find any security flaws or that I tried some of the "recipes" and
blew up a local pedophile's house.

My key is publicly available at the MIT keyserver; it has been since PGP
5.0 came out.  I have posted hundreds of times to Cypherpunks; most of
these posts have been signed with my key and include the fingerprint of my
key.  It would be fairly difficult for any attacker to forge a signature
with a false key; it would involve either rubber-hosing my passphrase,
changing history on all the Cypherpunks archives (including any on the item
end-user's machine and on the machines of all the Cypherpunks they
correspond with), or re-creating my private key from my public one.  A
similar situation exists for other entities that customarily sign their
posts, such as Bill Geiger, Monty Cantsin (assuming he ever got around to
posting his public key), Nerthus, etc.  "Certified by #314159" does not in
itself inspire confidence, but if hundreds of signed writings by #314159
exist, such that #314159 has high reputation capital, it begins to do so,
assuming that #314159's passphrase hasn't been rubber-hosed or otherwise
compromised.
