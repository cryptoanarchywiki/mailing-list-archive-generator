>      WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government agencies can punish employees who lie
>      while being investigated for employment-related misconduct, the
>      Supreme Court ruled unanimously Wednesday.
>      
>      The court overturned rulings in five separate cases that had barred
>      federal agencies from stiffening the disciplinary action taken
>      against wayward employees based on false statements they made when
>      questioned about their misconduct.
>      
>      Although the decision dealt with federal employees, its rationale
>      appeared to affect state and local government employees as well.
>      Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court that nothing
>      in the Constitution nor any federal law bars such punishment.
>      
>      "A citizen may decline to answer the question, or answer it
>      honestly, but he cannot with impunity knowingly and willfully answer
>      with a falsehood," Rehnquist said.
