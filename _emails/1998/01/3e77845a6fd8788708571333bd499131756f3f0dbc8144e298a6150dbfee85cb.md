This is why I favor systems where there is no way to localize the holder of
data.

I'm unpersuaded that any of the Eternity proposals avoid this. If _any_
site holding data is localized (traced, identified), it _will_ come under
legal, financial, or physical attack.

If a "network of nodes" is the server, that network and any identifiable
nodes in it will be attacked. It doesn't matter whether the precise server
of a precise piece of data can be pinpointed. (Think of the Gestapo, the
Inquisition, the Ayotollah, the BATF, and ask whether they would care if
the exact machine had been isolated?)

(Dangers of Eternity servers, a note: Also, the developers of such nodes,
and such software, will be major targets, no matter where they live. In
fact, how will source code for Eternity nodes be checked? It's hard enough
checking PGP source code, and no one even bothers to try to check remailer
source code for backdoors, bugs, etc. (no impugning of Mixmaster, but I see
no mention of people checking it, etc.). My point is a simple one: even if
Ryan Lackey leaves the country, as he says he plans to do, various entities
will probably either harass him, or, more ominously, get him to modify the
source code, to put "barium" in it, and all sorts of such things. Just a
thought.

Until I see proof that these suspicions are wrong, I can't get excited
about any of the Eternity schemes.
