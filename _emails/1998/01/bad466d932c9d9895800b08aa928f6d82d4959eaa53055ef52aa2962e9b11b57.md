If we assume that the document was submitted by mixmaster remailer,
and that there is another leap forward in factoring algorithms such
that 1024 bit isn't enough any more.  (Not like it hasn't happened
before cf Rivest & friend's original predictions of hardness of
RSA-129).

Now threat model is that NSA is archiving mail between mixmaster
nodes.  They observe which exit mail corresponds to the target
document.  They look at the set of mixmaster mails going into that
node which could plausibly have corresponded to that message as
determined by the pool size.

Repeat to get back to originator.  If we assume 100 message pool size
(probably generous) and chain of length 10, that is 1000 decryptions
which adds equivalent to 10 bits worth of symmetric key size.

Paranoid stuff yes, but the NSA mixmaster traffic archive doesn't seem
that unlikely.

It is interesting to note that Tim May's recent suggestion of LAM
(Local Area Mixes) would help here because if 5 of those mixmaster
nodes where part of a LAM, it is unlikely that the NSA would be able
to archive inter remailer traffic, thus increasing effective pool size
to 100^5.  So one advantage of the LAM approach is that it provides
links which are protected by physical security.

A user might like to amuse himself trying to use channels he suspects
will not be archived as the entry point.  Perhaps a disposable account
at a high volume free mail account like hot mail might be nice.  We
would like to push NSA's problem towards having to archive the entire
net traffic.

The design criteria of efficiency and robustness are conflicting.  Our
problem is to design something with useful tradeoffs.  Probably a
system offering a range of trade offs so that low risk documents can
make use of more efficient but less secure services, etc.

Yes.  We need to build constructs for all areas.  A mega hash would be
nice, with a large output size even in the face of birthday attack,
preferably as secure as a collection of hash functions.

That gives us something to wash our pseudo random number input entropy
with, and then we can go on to combine public key systems.

A problem with public key systems however is that there isn't a lot of
choice -- basically all based on discrete log or factoring.  So
perhaps RSA and DH combined in a construct with an optimistically
proportioned key size would be near all that could be done.

A variation of this is that if we can get widely deployed blanket
encryption (IPSEC), we have largely won because we can mix all sorts
of things below that envelope, and the NSA is reduced to archiving
some large proportion of network traffic.  Our task is then to design
protocols which aggresively rekey (earliest opportunity) and which
maximise the number of nodes which the NSA would need to archive
traffic between to recover traffic with future cryptanalysis.

I suspect archiving world Network traffic would pose something of a
operational and financial strain :-)
