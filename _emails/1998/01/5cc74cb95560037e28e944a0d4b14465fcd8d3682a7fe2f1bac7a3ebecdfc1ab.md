*** Paper withdraws story of Clinton sex 'witness'

The Dallas Morning News withdrew its Internet report Tuesday that a
Secret Service agent was ready to testify seeing President Clinton
and Monica Lewinsky in a compromising situation. The Dallas paper
took the report off its online edition and posted a statement saying
its source for the story had told them his information was wrong. The
paper had carried a front page report on its electronic Web site
saying the agent had spoken with independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
staff and was ready to testify as a government witness in the sex
scandal engulfing the White House. But within 4 hours the paper had
pulled the report and replaced it with a statement which said "the
source for the story, a longtime Washington lawyer familiar with the
case, later said the information provided for that report was
inaccurate. See
