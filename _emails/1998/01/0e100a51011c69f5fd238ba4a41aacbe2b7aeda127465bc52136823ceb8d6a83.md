This is, well what can I say but, BULL.

This is the typical line one gets from the sheeple, "I don't like MS but I
am *forced* to use it", or "I don't like Credit Cards but I can't live
without them".

Life sucks deal with it. You have two choices: either use it or don't but
quit your whining.

I will not use a dumbcard today, tomorrow, or ever (I have never owned a
CC).

The herd will always be the herd but if you follow along are you really
any different?
