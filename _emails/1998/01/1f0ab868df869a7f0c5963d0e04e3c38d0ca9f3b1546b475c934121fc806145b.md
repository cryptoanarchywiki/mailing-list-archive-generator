Actually, not at all.

There is no ban on publishing information on cloning, "just" a ban on the
activity.  Hence the first amendment is not implicated.  If it were the
case the every action (as opposed to speech/publication) were protected by
the 1st Am. then every statute making robbery a crime would be
unconstitutional too.

Similarly, the 4th Am. is not implicated.  The right to be secure against
UNREASONABLE search and seizure is not violated when and if congress
passes a law defining a new crime, or you are arrested for committing it.

again, note that the ban is on CLONING, not THINKING OR WRITING OR READING
about cloning.  It's not the same thing.

This is an aside, but the CRA is in no way anomalous given the 13th, 14th
and 15th Amendments.  It is only "anomalous" if one sticks to the
Constitution as written in the 18th century... and ignores the articles
written in that same century that clearly contemplate amendments....

Arguably, many of the legal bans in force today are due to ethics, e.g.:

* bans on suicide
* bans on plural marriage
* bans on certain abortions
* bans on ingestion of some substances

The courts in their infinite wisdom have not found these to be
unconstitutional laws.

Again, this misunderstands somewhat: the ban is on EXPERIMENTS (which are
indeed part of the search for truth), but not writing, reading thinking

Not directly, IMHO.
