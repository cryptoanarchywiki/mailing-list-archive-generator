Here, here.  Making threatening statements or calling for someone's harm are not to be tolerated.  However, predicting someone's continued good health (as a psychic) and wagering on that prediction against other (psychics) who have different predictions is a contest of skill and not a threat or illegal in any way, even if these wagers, psychics and payouts are anonymous.
