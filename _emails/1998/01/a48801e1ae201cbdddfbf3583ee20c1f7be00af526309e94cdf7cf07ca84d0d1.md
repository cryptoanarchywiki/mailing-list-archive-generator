I think that this was a legal decision by PGP, Inc. not out of concern by
the people doing the scanning overseas. I believe that they were trying to
sheild themselves from another lenghty court battle with the Feds but
still be able to make the source code available.

Unfortunatly PGP is nolonger the product of crypto-anarchists but is now
owned by the "suits" who tend to tread lightly in such matters
(shareholders realy don't care about crypto-anarchy principles unless
there is financial gain in doing so).
