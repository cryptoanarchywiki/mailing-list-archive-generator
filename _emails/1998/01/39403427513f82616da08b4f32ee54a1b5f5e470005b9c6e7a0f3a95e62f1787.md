If you begin by assuming that a free market will automagically acquire
someone with monopoly control who can prevent all competitors from acting,
you've got a rather different view of free markets than I do,
and you're basically assuming that anarchy is unmaintainable in economies,
from which the obvious conclusion is "so don't even try."
There are people who believe the same about political anarchy.

However, I don't see you presenting any reasoning for the belief
that a free market will become non-free and acquire a head.
Rather the opposite appears to have been the case in most environments
where the economic actors don't have political actors supporting
their bids for monopoly.
