At 10:29 AM 1/28/98 -0800, Tim May thoughtfully expounded thus:

While Sarfatti may be a bit whacko. PSI is proving to be anything but
nonsense.

I agree that there is a _lot_ of "sheep & goats" effect in the literature,
but I think Ed May's critiques of the AIR study of Remote Viewing done by
SAIC's Cognitive Sciences Laboratory (at http://www.lfr.org/csl/index.html
) are worth reading.  MI analysts who did RV at Ft. Meade have received
commendations and medals for the intelligence they generated using RV. 

FWIW
