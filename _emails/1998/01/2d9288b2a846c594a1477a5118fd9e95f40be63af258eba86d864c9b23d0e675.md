Any reason someone couldn't sell a generic (e.g., CHRP-like) PowerPC platform which can has at switch-selectable space for at least two OS boot SRAMs?  Ship it with Linux, but let the customer load whatever boot and OS they want.  There, of course, would be nothing the OEM could do if someone anonymously posted a MacOS compatible boot on a .warez group which purchasers subsequently loaded along with their separately purchased copy of MacOS 8-)
