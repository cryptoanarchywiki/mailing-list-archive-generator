No, I didn't get my information from television. I presume you mean the
"Nova" show some months back.

Why don't you use the Web and report what you find? I'm not inclined to go
out and do this research to answer your questions.

(I just found 800 hits on his name, including biographical material.)

If, by the way, you are surmising that he may've received NSA funding, this
seems dubious. Just because "elliptic functions" are involved....

In any case, his salary was paid by Princeton for most or all of those
years. As he had no equipment to buy, no students to support...his costs
were low.
