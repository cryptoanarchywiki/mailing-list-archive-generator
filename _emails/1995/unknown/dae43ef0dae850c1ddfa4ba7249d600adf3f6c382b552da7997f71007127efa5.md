  Perhaps.  Some authors might be offended by the idea that
using a different form of a sentence doesn't affect the work.

  Sounds like a disaster to me, unless it can be done
automatically, by a proven-correct program.  I used to use
commercial compilers that (at least claimed to) put their
"stamp" on the assembly code they generated, so they could sue
if you released a product without having a license for the
compiler.  Bugs are bad enough as it is; we don't need extra
ones that only show up in some copies!
