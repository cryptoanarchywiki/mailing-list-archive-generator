	This is not correct.  RC2 is not public; something that
interoperates with RC4 was posted to cypherpunks & sci.crypt last
year.  Neither have undergone any peer review that has been published
(AFAIK).  A paper on RC5 is listed in the Crypto 95 schedule, but
nothing on RC4.

	Also, the usability of RC4 is very open to question.  Since it
was a trade secret, it was not patented.  Several smart people have
said that once a trade secret becomes well known, its out protections.
But few people want to get a nasty letter ffrom RSA's lawyers, so no
one in the US has released anything with RC4 in it without the RSA
licenses.
