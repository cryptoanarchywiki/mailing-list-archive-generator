That's what I thought you meant.

That would be fine to use PGP 2.6.2 for; there's realky no question.

The ViaCrypt license only matters if you're using ViaCrypt.
The question of whether you can use PGP 2.6.2 for these is something
you _do_ need to read the RSAREF license about, and maybe ask
Jim Bidzos <jim@rsa.com> or a company lawyer-type about;
encrypted mail within the company is probably ok, encrypted mail sending
credit card numbers to pay for stuff is more questionable.
