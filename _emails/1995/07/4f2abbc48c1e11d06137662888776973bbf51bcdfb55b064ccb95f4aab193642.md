Careful here.  Deliberately or not, you are marginalizing the hard
work of dozens of people, including me.  You are suggesting our work
should have been done for Netscape instead, a program that a) is not
free software (FSF sense); b) has no mail reader; and c) has no
extension language.  Oh, and d) is horrendous as a news reader.

The packages that you implicitly denigrate provide far and away the
best interfaces to PGP available today.  They are written with the
tools available, whether it's a Windows shell, a hacked version of
Elm, or an Emacs Lisp package.

Maybe Netscape will include a mail reader someday.  Maybe Netscape
will include Java as an extension language someday.  But until that
day, the only people who can put crypto into Netscape are the folks at
Netscape Communications.

Netscape is not a platform.  It is a browser.  It is only useful for
viewing content that others have created, with a user interface that
any idiot can use.  Consequently, yes, it is very popular with the
masses and will become more so.

Can you name a platform for which it is possible to write a PGP front
end, but for which none has been written?  If it is ever feasible to
do what you suggest, someone will do it; your musings will have no
effect on that.  If you want to make a difference, try writing some
code yourself...
