The government doesn't want us to use any crypto that takes them an
appreciable ammount of time to crack. It seems inevitable to me that such
crypto will soon be outlawed. The same goes for anonymous remailers. It is
only a matter of (very little) time. Yes, Black Unicorn is right. We need
stealth encryption. Unfortunately even that won't help as much as one
might think, because it can only be used by tight conspirators who are
willing the to take the risk to be locked up in a concentration camp, I
mean jail, for the rest of their lives. Crypto for the masses is about to
fade away into history, before it ever really caught on.
