Anyone know how far ITAR reaches?  Is there a list of programs that are illegal
to take from america anywhere else?  My company does a LOT of buisness (80%)
outside the US, and I wonder if they are maybe pissing off the NSA or somthing
with some software they take with them.  (a DES encrypter, and some other
encryption stuff)
