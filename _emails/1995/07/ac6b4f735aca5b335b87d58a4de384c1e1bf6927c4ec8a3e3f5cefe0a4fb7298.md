    My motivation in suggesting the use of a pen-plotter to generate
    output was to make the letter appear to come from a flesh and
    blood human who doesn't do computers or even FAX.  Somewhere,
    perhaps from Jim Warren or the EFF, I had heard that the pols
    payed attention to handwritten letters far more than FAXs or
    email or phone calls.  The rant generator-to-postal mail gateway
    might give netters more leverage than we have now.
