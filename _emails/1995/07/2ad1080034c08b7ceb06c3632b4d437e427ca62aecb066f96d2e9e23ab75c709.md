Well put! I agree wholeheartedly! I have friends who are mostly teachers and
writers who are interested in encryption from what I've told them, but their
computer knowledge is pretty much limited to their word processors. A good
user interface would do wonders for spreading the use of PGP. Unfortunately
I am not a programmer either, but I am being motivated to become one. If
only there was more time...
