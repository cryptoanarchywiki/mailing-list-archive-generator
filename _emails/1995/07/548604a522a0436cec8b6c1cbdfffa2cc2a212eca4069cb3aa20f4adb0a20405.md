  If the "duty" cycle is 1 hour and there are 10000 users utilizing
the network, that tells you nothing. All it does it confirm that
User X sent a remailer message within the last hour. One could just
as easily finger User X and use the same reasoning.

  And if one has to suspect User X in the first place, User X has already
blown his cover partially (either by writing style or other leaks)
