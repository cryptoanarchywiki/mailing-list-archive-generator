Hal and others interested in HTTP proxying: I've just found an interesting 
alternative to CERN httpd at http://excalibur.usc.edu/ . I haven't yet 
played with it, but it looks promising. Caching should also play a useful 
role defeating traffic analysis, besides increasing the throughput.

  HIERARCHY

   The Harvest cache implements hierarchical caching: your cache at home
   can resolve URLs through your lab cache, which in turn can resolve
   requests through your institutional cache, which in turn can resolve
   requests through your regional network cache. The cache resolution
   algorithm, at each stage in the hierarchy, distinguishes parents from
   neighbor caches. A parent cache is a cache higher up the hierarchy,
   while a neighbor cache is one at the same level in the hierarchy.
