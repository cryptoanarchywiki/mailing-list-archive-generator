There has only been one company called "Atari".  They did split between home
computers and video games/PC game software when Jack Tramiel left Commodore
and bought Atari.

I thought that it wasn't decided in Atari's favor, but maybe I didn't hear
the final word.  I believe that they used a form of rom access that they
had patented and restricted producers by only licensing roms to those
they wanted.

If I remember, it had something to do with address auto-increment.

I always wondered how the 'Game Genie' people got enough information
to do what they did.  (A true 'wedge' cartridge that you could program
codes into for all games to give extra lives, hard to find abilities,
change parameters, etc.)
