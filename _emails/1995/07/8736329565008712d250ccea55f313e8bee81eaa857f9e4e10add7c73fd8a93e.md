I was the person who put the encryption back into that version of 
kerberos (which is now called eBones).  They removed all encryption calls.

They had actually pulled out all calls to the des routines, so we had a 
'working' authentication system that encrypted nothing.
This version was called Bones (they ran a program called parania over 
Kerberos, and that left Bones :-).  When I left, we had Kerberos working 
but I had not tested against 'true' kerberos.  I belive it has been fixed 
by 'those that have followed' and now fully interoperates with MIT 
kerberos v4.  So the 'international' version of kerberos is fully legal.

BTW I wrote libdes (my DES library) as part of this work.  Luckily I have 
    escaped from Kerberos/eBones when I left Bond Uni but my nights are
    still haunted with memories of trying to follow the code :-).
