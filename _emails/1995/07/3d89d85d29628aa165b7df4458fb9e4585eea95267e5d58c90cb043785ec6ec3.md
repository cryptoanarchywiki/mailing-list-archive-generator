   "As Regulators Seek to Police Internet, An Offbeat Finnish
   Service Fights Back." (PW cited earlier.)

      The U.S. Congress and governments from Singapore to New
      Zealand are mulling new efforts to control the flow of
      material over the Internet. But from a barren storefront
      in Finland's capital, Johan Helsingius is doing
      everything he can to prevent this. He may well be
      winning the fight.                             JUF_pug


   "Louis Freeh's Golden-Boy Image Faces Scrutiny Over FBI's
   Role in Shootout."

      During his 23 months as director of the Federal Bureau
      of Investigation, Louis Freeh has generated the
      golden-boy image the FBI needed. Now , Mr. Freeh's
      judgment is open to more intense scrutiny ... raises the
      possibility of that dreaded Washington phenomenon: the
      coverup.                                       REX_rug
