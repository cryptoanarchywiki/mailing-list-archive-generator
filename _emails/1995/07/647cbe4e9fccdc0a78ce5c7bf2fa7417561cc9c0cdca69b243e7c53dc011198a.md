Just because you don't know why they are classified that way doesn't
make the classifications invalid, and furthermore, I don't recall saying
that the DoD is perfect.  What I said was that they can't cost
effectively encrypt all information and that they also have requirements
that may make cryptography inapporpriate in certain circumstances, so
they have policies and perform risk analysis on what to spend money
protecting with cryptography.
