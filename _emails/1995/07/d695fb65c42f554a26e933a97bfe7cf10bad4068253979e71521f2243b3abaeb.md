As I understand RICO (Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,
though the euphonious "Rico," a la South American drug kingpins, is the
real reason for the name), only the assets imputed to the illegal act can
be seized. Thus, boats, factories, houses, etc., that are imputed
(believed, claimed) to have been bought partially or wholly from funds from
illegal acts can be seized.

Civil penalties are another matter. If you're charged with distributing
something illegal and a fine of $250,000 is levied, then you may have to
sell everything you own to pay it, but it's not a RICO seizure.
