The data sheets for the new Zyxel modems (Elite 2864/2864I) mentions that
they include DES capability.  The fully ISDN 2864I without/with NT-1
retails for $699/$749.  Only the I model (with built-in complete ISDN)
supports DES according to the data sheet.

2864 retails for $549 and they have a non-ISDN modem even cheaper.

They support almost every conceivable feature, including ISDN on both
B channels, ISDN on one with analog conversion on the other, and
built-in microphone and speaker jacks to better support voice
capability. (The 1496E's could be used as voice mail systems, etc.)

Firmware in flash EPROMS (8MBit) and supports 8MByte DRAM sockets for
addon memory (used to support buffering for it's plain paper fax
conversion to the built-in parallel port (without computer help)).

Of course, hard to tell if there's any way to control audio recording/playing
while having an active data connection with the standard eprom.

IF you could find out how to control it OR if there is a way to communicate
in a multichannel way to the various 'peripherals', then you could produce
a pretty nifty PGP-Voice system.

I didn't mention lots of other features (most inherited from the 1496's):
Caller-ID, distinctive ring, touch tone recognition, V.42bis over ISDN,
460.8KBPS/serial.
