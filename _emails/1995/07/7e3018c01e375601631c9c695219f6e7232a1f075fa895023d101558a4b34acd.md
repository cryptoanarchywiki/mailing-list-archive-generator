Yes, make your letters to Congressmen look like ransom notes...it really
gets their attention!

Seriously, I have no doubt that the next generation of "direct mail" will
be geared toward automatic generation of personalized letters, using
various natural language parser generators (a la the "rant generator" many
of us have used), variable fonts and margins, and so on.

This will further "flood the channel" and will ultimately make letter
writing mostly meaningless. IN my case, I skip most letters to the
editor--at least for local newspapers and weeklies--as they look to be
automatically written ("I am outraged at your article about converting
Lighthouse Point into a nuclear-powered whale-packing plant...").

Cypherpunks could probably have an effect on hastening this "denial of
service" attack on the efficacy of letter-writing by releasing an
easy-to-use package that does all this letter writing at the click of a
button....just type in some key words, for the topics, and it does the
rest.

An interesting project, actually.
