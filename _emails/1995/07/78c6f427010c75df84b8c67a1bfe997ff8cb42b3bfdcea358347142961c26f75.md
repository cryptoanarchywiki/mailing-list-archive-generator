Yes, I was the one who mentioned "Thunder." Should I justify why it is "not
a universal module"? I won't waste our time.

The essence, though, of having "parts" is that the suppliers of _other_
programs would not then have to supply the overlapping functions. In the
case of Thunder, it may be useful and all (which is what I said when I
mentioned it), but it's sufficiently obscure/unavailable that the makers of
my various word processing programs and page preparation programs supply
their own (and incompatible) dictionaries. This was my point.
