I kind of meant "why they think they can" rather than "why they want
to". One can't really help being aware these days what the US
government (and indeed many others) are trying to do.

Judging by the PZ case, I can't say as I can really blame them. it
would be better of course if they would go for it, but ...

I probably should have written "a crypto package" instead of "the
matching crypto package".

This would infer that anything that can cause information to be piped
out to a package and then the result sucked back in would fall into
this category.

Hmmm

Our lot tend to work in a different way to yours. Similar end result
of course, but different approach.

So when I said "yet". I was meaning that, at the moment, we have no
laws specifically refering to Cryptography and it's export, but the
approach I can see being taken would be:

1 - Find yourself a tenuous link with some Psycho-Baby-Killer group.
2 - Start a "This must be stopped" campain.
3 - Propose the "Internet Pornography Act"
4 - Shove it through before anyone can get together enough
    opposition to get it squashed. (and that would have to be a
    GREAT DEAL of opposition).

That's how they did the "Criminal Justice Act" which breaks both
European and International law in a great many places. That's how
they'll do the "Internet Pornography Act". It'll be just loose enough
to include just about anything they want it to.
