My sentiments in a way, you'll see some higher end PC users moving to 
this, plus the usual gammut of teenage hackers, like I was.

not completely, it can load it and some apps if you run it like you used 
to have to on a 286.  WINE is far from complete.  The thing is some major 
software compnies are actually taking initiative and making lInux native 
apps, like Wordperfect is coming out in Fall, and Matlab and Mathematica 
are either here already, or will be here in a month or so.  Alot fo 
commercial databases are coming to Linux too.

BUT, please PLEASE, let's not let this turn into a advocacy war, I hang 
out on those groups myself and get enough of them there, don't need it 
here.  I think we're all intelligent enough to realize that both platform 
bases have advantages and disadvantages.  I personally get a woody form 
anything that flips bits so I'm not about to argue.
