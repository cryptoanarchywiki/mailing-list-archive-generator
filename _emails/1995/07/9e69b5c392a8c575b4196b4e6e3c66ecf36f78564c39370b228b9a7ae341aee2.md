Steve,

I'm forwarding this to cypherpunks, where this posting originated. Always
ready to set the record straight. By the way, could I have an email copy of
your original posting/publicity material for this, I'm curious about where
it was announced to the net. Tighten up my links to the straight dope, etc.

Thanks!

Bob Hettinga
