I composed my "misfeasance in office" post before reading this
thoughtful  and well researched message from Damaged Justice.
I had read all of the messages in my mailbox with "Re: Root
Causes" as the subject, but missed this one, since the subject
line had been changed.

Damaged Justice has looked into this in much greater depth than
I have, and raises some interesting possibilities.  
(Obviously, IANAL.)
