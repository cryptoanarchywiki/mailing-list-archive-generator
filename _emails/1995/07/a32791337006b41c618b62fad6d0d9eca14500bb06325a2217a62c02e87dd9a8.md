Dear First Virtual,

You now present puzzling information.

You have cashed my check.
So why are you telling me that you have no bank information.
You stated that the check itself provided the bank information.
If this situation persists,
I will forward said materials and
correspondence to the State of Minnesota Attorney General's Office,
and the U.S. District Attorney's Office for prosecution.
For what you have connumicated so far surely appears fraudulent.

I don't have much money as it is. But then maybe (considering all of
the lag time) this is your scam. Maybe this is entirely legitimate,
and just an honest mistake.

I have added below your opening correspodence of July 18th, the day 
before the check cashed.

Awaitng your response,

Carol Anne Braddock
