You should investigate an idea known as the provisional patent that is
relatively new to the United States. They're supposedly shorter and
designed to give you some claim to the ideas as well as some time to
develop them enough to file a real patent. I can't give you any other
advice except to tell you that my patent agent is also curious about them
because they're new.
