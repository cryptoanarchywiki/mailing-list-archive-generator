I agree as the collisions aren't too bad (except in my /usr/local/bin...).

I was actually contemplating a modification to CFS to support a
tunneled TCP based NFS related operation.

CFS, like other specialized NFS servers, talks to NFS clients like
the normal NFS server, but runs on a different RPC port (so you can
run several types of NFS servers).  CFS encrypts directories that 
can be attached and detached without changing the NFS mount.

It occurred to me that it wouldn't be too tough to have one CFSD
open a TCP/socket connection to another CFSD and pass file access
requests instead of implementing them locally.  The encryption
of the ssh link and the on disk encryption of CFSD should be a 
good combination.

I've been compiling under Linux and have had a number of autoconfiguration
errors.  I'll produce a simple-minded patch shortly.
(Thinks I'm cross-compiling, have some include files I don't, don't
have waitpid/wait3, collision with stdc crypt/random defs, etc.)
