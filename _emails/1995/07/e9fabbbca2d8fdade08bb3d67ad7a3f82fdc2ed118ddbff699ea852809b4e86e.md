Perhaps.  I went to a computer store the other day, and saw almost two 
dozen different packages for e-Space access, each with different 
software... 2 or 3 with netscape, 2 or 3 with mosaic, everything else 
just custom packages, mostly.

And from what I've heard about HotJava (not seen it yet, can't comment 
strongly) there needs another jump in PC power before it would be useful 
at the home level.  Part of why we were stuck with DOS for so long is 
that it was what got the job done when the revolution happened.  For that 
reason, I agree that HTML/Integrated browser solutions are what we're 
looking at, and at the same time don't have strong hopes for HotJava, 
though I would like to see it succeed.

All dogmas are ultimately Bad Things.  But dogma gets stuff done in the 
short run.  NetScape deserves to be popular; they followed the truth that 
most PC users like "pretty" better.  And they made the best "pretty" 
software.

Agreed.  It's still too early to tell.  This is like 100AD and we're 
trying to predict the Catholic Church of the twentieth century, trying to 
figure out fifteen years down our road.   I really believe that's how 
fast we're moving right now, and we have to hit as many targets as we can.
