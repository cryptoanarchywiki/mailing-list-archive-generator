Ssh has already been registered with IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority) as the name of the service.  I would rather not change it
without a compelling reason.  It is also easy to obtain from rsh by
replacing the r by s (which also makes for scp, sshd, and in future
maybe also sdist).  It is my understanding that CFS is in rather
limited use (especially outside the US), and the ssh shar extractor is
not widely used either (neither can be found from the archie database
at archie.funet.fi).  IETF has a thing called Site Security Handbook
that they abbreviate SSH, but it is probably sufficiently different
not to be confused.

True.

The agent protocol can currently be used to forward a connection to
any program (which can mean device) that can perform RSA
authentication.  New authentication methods can be compatibly added
later.

S/Key can be used by making skeysh you login shell.  Then you will
first be asked for a normal password (if any), and then for the
one-time password.  I did not want to incorporate skey functionality
directly into the software, because it is not clear to me if the
arrangements in use (file names, formats, algorithms) have stabilized
yet.  Also, there is less need for skey as no passwords are
transmitted in the clear.

Maybe, *maybe*, TCP/IP port forwarding could be used for this?  (I
don't know what CFS does because I have never seen CFS.)
