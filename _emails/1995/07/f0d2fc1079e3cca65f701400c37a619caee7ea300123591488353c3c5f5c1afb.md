I don't know if anyone else from this list is going but I will be 
there for the whole conference and wouldn't mind meeting up with some 
of the people from this list.  You might want to join the "defcon 
stuff" list.  It is just for people going to DefCon to talk about 
meetings and stuff.  It is dc-stuff@fc.net (I think) if that doesn't 
work mail me and I'll get it from one of my message.
