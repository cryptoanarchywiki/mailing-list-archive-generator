C'punks,

I ran across an old book I bought when I was an adolescent.  Like
most boys (I don't know about girls) I went through a phase when
I was interested in magic.  The name of the book was "Houdini on
Magic."

In it, there is a section about Houdini's fascination with
cryptography.  He talks about relatively primative substitution
ciphers and the like.  One example, though, I thought might be of
interest to Cypherpunks.  He said the following inscription was
written over the Decalogue in a country church.  Apparently, no
one was able to read it for over 200 years.  Can you?:
