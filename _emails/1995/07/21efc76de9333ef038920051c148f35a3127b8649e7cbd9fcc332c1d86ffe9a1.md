   I found these paragraphs in a recent Space News interesting.  They were
   at the end of an article titled "Military Officials Open To Using
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Civilian Links" in the July 3rd issue. 

[...]
     "Iridium, Globalstar, Inmarsat-P and Odyssey all plan to include
   features to permit authorized eavesdropping, officials said. 

Hmm. Anyone here ever heard of the Walkers, or the Rosenbergs?

It's a pity that the military has decided that in its zeal to listen
in on phone calls, that national security is an expendable asset.

It looks like the Chinese or Russian Armies won't be any better by
the time they're occupying us, unfortunately.

(The really awful part is that what friends I have that are current
or past U.S. military don't want to die, AFAIK).
