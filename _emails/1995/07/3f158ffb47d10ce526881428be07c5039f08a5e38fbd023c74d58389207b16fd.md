Draconian as it is, you seem to be overlooking some of the (ever so faintly)
mitigating clauses of this Grass-t-ley bill. Pre-arranged GAK is an admissible
excuse for dodging the crypto ban, so ROT-13 could still be distributed.

Why do you think Egghead couldn't sell crypto any more ?  It's not a computer
network by any definition I've heard so far....
