While I recognize this to be the case, it remains exceedingly
frustrating.  It would seem that a textbook example of
misfeasance (not malfeasance) would be the act of introducing
and/or participating in the passage of legislation that a
member knew or should have known was unconstitutional -- at
least when misfeasance is defined as "the performance of a duty
or right which one has the right to do, but in a manner such as
to infringe upon the rights of others."  [anno. 20 ALR 104]

servant and a fearful master."                      - George Washington
