    Given that games usually program close to the hardware, and are 
    therefore the _most_ difficult things to port from one environment
    to another, it really makes one wonder why Excel isn't out for
    (for example) Linux or BSD today.

Microsoft has lots to lose from making software available to systems
that "comptete" with MS-DOG and Windoze.  It's clearly in their best
interests to not make their software run under Unix and/or X11
(although WABI has some interesting implications in that regard).

On the other hand, that would seem to imply that it's in a lot of
other people's interest to port their software -- every little bit of
leverage against Microsoft helps.
