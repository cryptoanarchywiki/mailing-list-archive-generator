Hmm... the stuff that was from the "one-time pads" that were recently 
decrypted says it was fairly certain they were.  So says Kahn. :)

I'm not convinced that there was enough public information available for 
a reasonable conviction back in the 50's, but there seems to be now.

The Mumia case (something friends of mine are more than peripherally 
acquainted with) seems to be very much in doubt.  Of course, they'll kill 
him anyway, probably.  But I suggest reading E.L. Doctrow's essay on the 
subject from the NYT of several weeks (months? possibly) back.
