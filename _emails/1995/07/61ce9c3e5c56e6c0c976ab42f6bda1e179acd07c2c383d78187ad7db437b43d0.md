I'm not so sure. (Yes, I'm very cynical about humans -- more than most people
on the list, I think.)  Everybody and her sister has been bombarding the
firewalls list lately, asking about virus scanners and such. IMHO a *lot* of
folks would be quite content to have somebody filter their mail "for viruses,
harassment, etc."  I hope I'm wrong....
