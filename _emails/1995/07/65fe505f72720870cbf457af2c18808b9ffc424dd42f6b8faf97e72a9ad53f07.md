Really?  Do you have a reference for this?  I am interested.

WOW!  Had them killed?  They WERE tried and convicted, you know.  Are you 
claiming evidence was manufactured?  I head David Khan on CSPAN say that 
at least one message mentions Ethel Rosenberg.  If memory serves, he said 
something like "without going in to whether evidence was sufficient to 
convict, and without going in to whether they should have been executed, 
these transcripts show that they were spying for the Soviets"  
(I'm not sure that's accurate enough for quotation marks, but that's the 
basics of what he said.  I have it on VCR.

Do you have additional information?  I'll agree the FBI hasn't always behaved 
honorably, and maybe they aren't entitled to the benefit of the doubt here.

OTOH, actual, admitted facts to this effect might be a great reply to Mr. Freeh 
when he asks to be allowed to punish us when we make our mail so he can't read 
it.
