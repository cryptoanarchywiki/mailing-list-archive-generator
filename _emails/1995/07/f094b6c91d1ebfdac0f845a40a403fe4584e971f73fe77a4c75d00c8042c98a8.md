Only by violating the Constitution and basic common sense,
but that doesn't usually bother the Government very much...

It's not defined in the law, and if the good Senator writes stupid offensive
laws which are so stupid that they have big holes in them like this,
I don't intend to correct him :-)

Nobody knows.

The proposed law doesn't say that the mechanism has to decrypt the
message in a short period of time.  If the law passes, I'll be happy to help 
write the PGP Universal Decoder program for anybody who needs it to take to
court.
Some kinds of program are affected by the Halting Problem; other kinds
are easy to show that they halt.  For the PGP Universal Decoder,
trial division can find the factors for an N-bit key in much less than
2**N tries, if you program it well, and you know it will halt by then,
if the Universe hasn't decayed first.
