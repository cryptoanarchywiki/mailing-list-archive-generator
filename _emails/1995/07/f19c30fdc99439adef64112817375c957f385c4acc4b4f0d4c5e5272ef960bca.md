Kahn (1962) doesn't really explain why vital Magic intercepts and
the 'winds' execute did not prevent the Pearl Harbour disaster. 

I just read 'Infamy' by John Toland (1982), containing 'proof'
- very convincing, in my opinion - of the Pearl Harbour cover-up.
The US president, selected members of his cabinette and a
few admirals and generals knew - from Magic and the 'winds'
execute, radio traffic analysis, diplomatic sources, double
agents - exactly when and where the Japaneese were going to
attack, but didn't warn Hawaii, fearing that too efficient
counter-measures by the Oahu military might make the attack
abort and so not convince the isolationists. The unexpected 
tactical capabilities of the Japaneese armada then made a
cover-up all the more important.

What has been revealed since? Are the views in Toland's book
now 'official', established history, or what?

Mats
