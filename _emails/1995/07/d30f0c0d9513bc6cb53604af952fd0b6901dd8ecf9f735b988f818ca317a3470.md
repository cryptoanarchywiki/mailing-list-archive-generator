   "True Believers Gather To Honor White Race: Aryans Open
   Annual Congress in Idaho. Angry outbursts, and an
   increasing focus on Hitler and Nazi ideals."

      White supremacists from around the country and Canada
      gathered here this weekend for the Aryan World Congress,
      an annual celebration of the white race and
      anti-Semitism. The congress is being held at a time when
      Federal lawmakers are pushing to learn more about white
      supremacists, paramilitary organizations and other
      fringe right-wing groups following the Oklahoma City
      bombing.                                       NAZ_raz


   "The Unending Search for Demons In the American
   Imagination. Pick a villain. The Jesuits? The arms makers?
   The U.N.? Or maybe you like Ike."

      Today's militia members aren't the first to warn that
      plots are eating at America. There's a familiar ring to
      much of their fear. A vast array of Cassandras echo
      through American history. Through the centuries the
      vlllains of the pieces have shifted -- from Masons to
      Catholics to Jews, for example -- but the alleged plots
      also have a lot in common: a foreign (or otherwise
      alien) connection, a tie to big money, a secret
      organization more powerful than any state.     IFU_knu


   "Attack of the Cyberthieves, and Other Assaults."

      Cyberthis. Cyberthat. Could it all be cyberhell? As we
      venture through the digital gates into information
      heaven, it might be wise to recall earthly matters. Like
      theft, for starters.                           NFO_rip
