Everybody needs to take a deep breath and count to 1,000. Seriously,
we're all feeling plenty of stress today. Various people have been
talking about getting out of the U.S. while the going's good (?), and
it doesn't sound much like hyperbole this time. It's not surprising that
we're releasing our frustration on each other, lashing out at the nearest
quasi-tangible targets.

Don't let them do this to us -- to you !  Remember, in the grand scheme
of things, we are all very definitely on the same side of Evil like
S.974. We need to pause, gather our wits a bit, and focus on some debate
and action, rather than directing our anger at each other. This is no
time for infighting, grudges, etc.
