   I've been on several moderated mailing lists. There are those who moderate
   very lightly, moderately, and heavily.

I guess the first uses regular water as the moderator, and the latter
some sort of deuterated water. My nuclear physics is a little rusty,
though, so I have to ask: does the "moderately" moderated system use
liquid sodium?
