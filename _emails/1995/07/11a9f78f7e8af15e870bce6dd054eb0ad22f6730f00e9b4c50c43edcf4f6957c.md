Eh, what do "virus hackers" have to do with encryption, why is it these 
morons justify the destruction of encryption by mentioning hackers and 
viruses?

Additionally, does this mean that someone outside of the USA is in danger 
of being grabbed by RICO armed thugs from Uncle Sam's cadre for writing 
crypto software and publishing it in the open?  After all, once it winds 
up on some USA site, how do we know that someone outside the USA got his 
copy of SuperDuperNSASpookFree from a non-US site?  Just to be sure, 
we'll bust both the site operator and nab the guy who wrote it next time 
he drops in, or hell, we'll have him extradited.

Yes, whenever man develops a privacy increasing technoloy, the spooks 
will see to it, that they abuse everyone's rights to that privacy, and 
then some!

Where is Elliot Ness?  I don't see any mafia.org on the net.  Anyone here 
see any such site?

Was it not proven that McVeigh and Co. >DID NOT< use a computer?  THe AOL 
account was a hoax, no?  Where are the hoardes of anti-USA terrorists, 
and drug pushers on the net?  Certainly, I see no drugs.com site... web, 
ftp, email, usenet or otherwise.

Yeah, so, why blame citizen units in the USA for actions outsiders 
committed.?  Why limit the spread and use of cryptographically strong 
tools from being developed in the USA?

If Joe Badguysky breaks into your house and steals your copy of PGP, then 
exports it to his fatherland, should I arrest you for that?  What if he 
breaks into your store and steals a copy off the shelf and exports it?  

Why punish the victim?

Oh, the poor poor LEA's.  If they can't prove you're guilty (because you 
aren't, and there is no proof because you aren't,) let them throw you in 
jail anyway.

And this type of bill is where the potential for abuse and harm arises.  
The harm of course is to those who will be thrown in jail for wanting 
privacy.

Gee, who is scared?  Don't be scared, be Big Brother. :-(

Circular reasonings and politician's spewing?  I can see th masses 
applauding this... all wearing PJ's and bearing shaved heads watching Big 
Brother on the screen infront of them...

So, what countries are left free of encryption regulations? (English 
speaking preffered, with affordable net access.)  Time to see about 
getting a new passport...
