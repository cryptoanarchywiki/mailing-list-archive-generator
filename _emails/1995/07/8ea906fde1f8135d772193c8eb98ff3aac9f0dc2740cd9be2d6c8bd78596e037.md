You asked this before (on June 4) and I answered (on June 21), but I take it
you weren't reading the list then.  Briefly, Matt Ghio's list is the only
publicly announced list I've found -- the pertinent Usenet FAQs point solely
to his list. mailto:mg5n+remailers@andrew.cmu.edu for the current list.

I don't know how much Matt's been updating it, but I have yet to find an
alternative.

My previous reply may be found at http://www.hks.net/cpunks/cpunks-15/1567.html

I'm not aware of any standard protocol for this. Try sending mail to system@,
root@, etc.

ObFlame1: Anon, if only nsb@fv *did* write copiously here !
ObFlame2: Brad D., at least make Orlin send this crap to the list himself
