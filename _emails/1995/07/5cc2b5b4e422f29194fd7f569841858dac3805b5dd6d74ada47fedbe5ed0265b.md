Or, more precisely, they have a strong affinity for private in-group
communications.
Cryptography's a bit tough in an environment where it was often illegal to
teach slaves to read.  On the other hand, oral cultures are often good at
using metaphor and in-jokes and shared knowledge to express things that
the speaker doesn't want the oppressive group to understand.  I've seen
commentaries
talking about that in North American black culture, and there are other examples
like Cockney rhyming slang.  And then, of course, there are totally
incomprehensible
communication systems like Gaelic :-), which the Brits tried hard to stamp out.
