I have already explained my comments in another thread, but I figure I
should respond to this anyway.

That is not all you said; you also suggested that existing interfaces
for "Tin, Pine, Elm, Joe, Emacs, etc." were a waste of time.

 tcmay> Take it or leave it, as an analysis, but the "try writing some

I have apologized for the insulting tone, but I do not feel the
comment was meaningless.  If you are going to criticize my development
efforts, I think it is fair for me to ask, "And what have *you* done?"

The point being, of course, that the criticism itself is unwarranted;
not to make a meaningless insult.

It was a specific response to an insult of my (and others') work.
Again, I apologize.

I would hope you would keep the forward-looking vision while ditching
the critical tone.  Those "ghettoized approaches" are the best we have
at present, and they are responsible for the widespread use of PGP,
such as it is.
