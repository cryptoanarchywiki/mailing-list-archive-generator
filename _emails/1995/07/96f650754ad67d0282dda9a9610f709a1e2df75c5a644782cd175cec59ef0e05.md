Just an aside --
  J C Penney invented the $n.95 pricing scheme so that his clerks
would have to make change.  That way they had to use their registers,
recording the sale and the cash didn't just go into their pockets.
Even at that early date, proper security of automated systems depended
largely on human factors.
