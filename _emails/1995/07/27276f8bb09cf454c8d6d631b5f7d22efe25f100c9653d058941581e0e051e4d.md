You need LEXIS to look this up? Must have been published in one of
those legal journals that only the priests of the black robe are
allowed to subscribe to. :)

May I recommend Bennett B. Patterson: _The Forgotten Ninth Amendment: A Call
for Legislative and Judicial Recognition of Rights Under Social Conditions of
Today_. Originally published in 1955 by Bobbs-Merrill of Indianapolis and
authored by a member of the Texas Bar. Supposedly long out of print, the
master plates are rumored to have been destroyed. A reprinted edition was
being made available recently as part of a "9th Amendment Legal Defense Kit"
that a man named Conrad LeBeau was selling a few years ago (by all reports,
he was fighting the FDA with marginal success, since FDA jurisdiction is a
matter of contract law). At last report, you could reach Conrad at: Health
Freedom Reporter, PO Box 272, Hales Corner, WI, USA.

Another good one is Randy Barnett's _The Rights Retained by the People: The
History and Meaning of the Ninth Amendment_. The Web link at Book Stacks is:
