The crypto section has no GAK exclusion.  It makes it as illegal to release
GAKed crypto on a net as PGP.



I believe that the concern about defining predicate acts this way comes
from the RICO requirement that there be TWO instances of a crime in order
to pass the test of perpetrating a *pattern of crime* and therefore be
ranked as a mobster subject to RICO.  My guess is that the intent is that
from one placement on an FTP server or one posting to a newsgroup, the
perpetrator of that heinous act will have passed his RICO qualification and
therefore be subject to having all he owns taken from him.

Meanwhile, the Federal civil forfeiture fund goes to good things.  The last
$9M (I believe it was) went to buying up AT&T DES phones to be made into
Clipper phones.  Of course, the conversion hasn't happened yet and the DES
phones are sitting in a warehouse someplace -- but the $9M fund went to
really good use, saving the world from AT&T DES.
