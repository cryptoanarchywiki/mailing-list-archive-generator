    Actually, your little project could cause some major problems 
    in a area you may not anticipate  --- personnel selection.

    Specifically, the use of Handwriting Analysis as a tool for 
    personnel profiling.

    Making the little problem Tim presents, a major headache for 
    somebody else --- handwriting analysts.

    Actually, True Type fonts of your handwriting are available, 
    for any platform that accepts that font type.  I don't have 
    the URL for them, but there is a pointer to it at 
    HTTP://www.ntu.ac.sg/~tjlow/gclub.html

    Using it would play hell for handwriting analysts, though.  
    And if it was programmed to change the pen pressure as well 
    --- the possibilities are staggering.  Can a pen plotter 
    change pressure?

    But of course.

    I don't remember the title, but at least one french novel was 
    rumored to have been entirely generated by computer.  

    Tim May > Of course this is also similar to the "style

    I don't remember the program name, but there is software 
    available now, that analyzes a document, and figures out who 
    wrote it --- based on the frequency count of the letters of 
    the alphabet.  Secondary measures are frequency counts of 
    letter pairs.  Words, phrases, sentences etc are totally 
    ignored.  So what you'd need to do here, to pass your pseudo- 
    Turing Test is a program that generates different statistical 
    results, for allegedly different people.

    Or might just subject all mail to various automations, which 
    accept/reject mail, based on what it looks for.  << If it 
    passes the congress person's Turing Test, it is read, as being 
    authentic --- although I doubt half the people in the capital

    Actually, the usual give away, is in letter and letter pair 
    frequencies --- not spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, 
    etc.

    However, there a technique called _Scientific Content 
    ANalysis_ that looks at how things are said, to judge their 
    "truthfulness."  A good program will not show that the text 
    was randomly generated, nor show that the author is off-the- 
    wall, so to speak.

    You may have bitten off a bit more than you can chew here.  
    OTOH, a group that tries to crack keys, knowing that the 
    possibility of success is slim to non-existent, can probably 
    pull this one off --- if only because the possibility of 
    success is pretty good.  

    Er, how did the cracking of the key go?   Last I read 60+%, 
    and no hints of it being broken.   << I almost want to 
    participate, but with a dx25, running NovellDos, I'm not sure 
    what that platform could do.  << I''ll graduate to Linux,
