Well, now, I wouldn't say THAT....

There are those of us intent enough of defending our rights as to go so 
far as to make an effort of getting to where we can do so more easily.  
While I know I was shouted down over NYET, the group does know where I 
stand on the issue of, for instance, free crypto or the Exon Hustler 
Protection Act.  I intend to run for JP in '98, and (assuming our 
electoral system, if not our Constition is still intact) higher office 
later.  If I win, you can bet your keyring passwords that _I_ will make 
sure that my juries are aware of FIJAs position papers.

There are others--including one John Tello, a member of the Texas State 
Republican Executive Committee, who almost single handedly got a unanimous 
resolution out of the TX SREC calling for an end of our 60-year emergency 
and a recision of various related acts.

Bluntly, if you are bellyaching but _not_ involved with an organized 
political structure that is capable of influencing legislation, then I 
blame YOU for this legislation.  I am, have, and/or shall have lobbied every 
Congressman with whom I can claim a minimal connection.  And I've done 
the work so that this is a non-trivial list.

Direct mail is useful.  But until you've worked to get someone elected, 
you are just one more voice in the roar.  The '96 campaigns are shaping 
up.  (I'm already putting the word out for '98...)  This is the time to 
find people who share our views, and work so that they win their 
primaries--or maybe don't even have to fight one.  Or maybe its time 
_you_ ran.
