  Has anyone previously noted that HR361, the omnibus export
  administration act, would require the administration to assess the
  impact of the current crypto export controls on the software industry?

I don't recall seeing mention of it, but this has been planned for
awhile.  There were a couple of crypto surveys, one by private industry
(software publisher's association) and one by TIS for the gov't.  I think.

Both were mentioned in this list.
