I understand how that works, but how did the admin-dude bypass my passwd 
(a combo of six letters/numbers only known to me)?  My log file says that 
he only made one attempt at getting in.

Can CMOS store my passwd AND perhaps an admin passwd established in CMOS 
before I received the crummy PS/2?  Is it encrypted?  Do CMOSes in 
general encrypt their passwds ==> can code be added where the passwd is 
stored?  How much space is in the "memory" of CMOS?

Thanks for all the replies...

Jon C.
