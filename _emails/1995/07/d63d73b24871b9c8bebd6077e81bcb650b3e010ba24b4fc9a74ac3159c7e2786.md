Now, I'm not sure of this, but as far as I can see, if I was a 
blackmailer wanting to receive an untraceable payment I could do the 
following :

	I create my ecash serial number/hash
	I blind it with a random number
	I send it to the payer

	Payer blinds it again and sends it to the bank
	
	Bank signs it and returns it

	Payer removes their blinding and returns the result to me

	I remove my blinding and send it to the bank for payment with
	no chance of being traced.

Will this work ?
