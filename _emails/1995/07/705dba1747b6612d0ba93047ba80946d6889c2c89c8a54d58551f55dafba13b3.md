Did you promise not to use strong crypto?  

My (definitely NOT scumbag etc.) employer has notified all 
email users that email is NOT private.  As far as I know, 
(and I think I WOULD know) management has never examined email 
not addressed to them, but if they felt it was justified, 
I'm sure they would.  After all, it is their computer.....

Its not censorship when you refuse to pay for the podium!
