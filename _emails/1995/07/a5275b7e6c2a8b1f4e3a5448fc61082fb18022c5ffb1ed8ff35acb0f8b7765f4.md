Todays (sunday 7-16-95) NYT Magazine has an excellent (IMHO) article by
Esther Dyson on why the government should not regulate the net.  Its not
written for techies like us, its written for normal non-wired people, like
our parents and our senators.

The article is clear, easy to follow, makes it points well, and refrains
from overused analogies about highways and roadkill.  So next time you're
at a loss for words arguing with some clueless offline luser about why porn
and pedophiles really aren't  rampant all over the net, show them this
article.
