Dear Cypherpunks,

   This is mostly an old post that Monty Harder sent me
concerning my
program Superwipe. I got his ok to post it to Cypherpunks so
that it
would stimulate debate on my program.

   In addition to the original problem of wiping compressed
sectors, I
have found a second problem: with cacheing software and the
now
ubiquitous several hundred k hardware ram caches, it is
about impossi-
ble to do multiple wipes on sectors. Anyone else got any
ideas?

not handle

1's & you know
GJ> what a compressed disk driver will do with them. The
driver would

fair compromise

>(gotta get in that plug) followed by random garbage.

GJ> crush them down to a few bytes at the beginning of the
file & the rest
GJ> of the file would not be touched.

GJ>    I have decided that I can solve that problem by
writing a random
GJ> number generator function and filling the file with non-
compressable
GJ> random numbers.

compressed at 7:16
>(DoubleSpace, Stacker, et.al. typically use 16 sectors per
cluster).

this, but

necessary. I

compressed

assure, and
>that sensitive data are best kept on uncompressed drives.


GJ>    Also, I am thinking of putting SUPERWIPE into the
public domain.
GJ> I would use the privacy functions presently in it and
also include a
GJ> few more privacy functions. If I put it into the public
domain, then
GJ> I will have to distribute source code. This could make
me more vunerable

include a

That would be

code with the
>usual export controls, separately.
