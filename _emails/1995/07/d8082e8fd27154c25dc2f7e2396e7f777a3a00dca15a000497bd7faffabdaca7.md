This is generally true of sockets programming.  You don't know that you'll get
as many bytes as you request.  The simplest solution is to loop your read
calls until you get what you need.  See BSD Sockets: A Quick & Dirty Primer
for a sample solution.  The URL is http://www.ntua.gr/unix/sockets.html
