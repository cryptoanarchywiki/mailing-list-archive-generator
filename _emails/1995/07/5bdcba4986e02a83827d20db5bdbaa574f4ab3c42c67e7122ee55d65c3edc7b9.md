For those who want to buy and sell ecash for real cash, there's now an
experimental Ecash Market WWW page at :

http://www.c2.org/~mark/ecash/ecash.html

You can submit an offer to add to the lists of buyers and sellers for free
(though if people start submitting fake offers I may charge for it in
future), or buy the email address of a buyer or seller for c$ 0.50.  Since
I'm still in the process of finishing off the software, the site may go up
and down, or simply get dodgy, over the next few weeks. 

	Mark
