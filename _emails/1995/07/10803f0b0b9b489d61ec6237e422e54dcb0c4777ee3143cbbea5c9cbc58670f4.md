The NYT-reported ceremony was on C-SPAN (1 or 2) last night; I 
saw only a snippet of Moynihan mumbling. Maybe there will be a 
replay sometime today that may provide clues to the sharp ear.


Held at the CIA, the clip showed lots of backs of heads of 
creme de les zipped-lipped crypto-slaves. Unctous Freeh, 
Deutch, the spy-brass were all there, lipping the New Yarper -- 
an ouvert HERF-zap would have spattered their sucrets.
