Far as I can tell, this is meaningless.  If you sign a paper "consenting"
to email monitoring by your employer, they've got a green light, period.
And under those circumstances, I'd think very few companies would be
foolish enough not to just ask you to sign.  So the only ones who have to
worry are those who don't get your "permission" first, and probably more
and more companies will just be more up front about it in the future.

The tightwad, privacy-loathing scumbags I work for sprang just such a
document on us recently, and after squirming and bitching about it for a
while, I actually did sign, simply because I wasn't prepared to lose my job
at that point.  My fear, based on well-established tradition, is that
eventually this will become widespread and more and more employers will
monitor email, with coerced "consent."
