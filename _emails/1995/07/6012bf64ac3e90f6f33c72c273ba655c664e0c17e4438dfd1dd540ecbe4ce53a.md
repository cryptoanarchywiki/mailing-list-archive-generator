     This sort of thing bugs me a lot. If your level of passion
on an issue is not enough to send an individually composed letter,
then send a form letter. But don't try to fake out people that
your note is actually individually composed. One of my pet peeves
is junk mail tricked up to look like something else. I expect 
legislators feel the same way, and have a lot of practice 
recognizing it.

     Personally, if I feel strongly about an issue, I call up
the legislators office and give his/her aide a piece of my mind.
I try to be polite, informative, and find an angle of interest
to that particular legislator, no matter how much I may actually 
despise the slimeball (this was tough when talking to Exon's
press secretary).
