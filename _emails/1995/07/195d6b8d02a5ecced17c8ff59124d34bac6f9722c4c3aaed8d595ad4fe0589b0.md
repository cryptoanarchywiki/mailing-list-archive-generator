These are real ball-park figures based on looking at "free memory"
from vmstat from several instances of launching, running, then exiting
from the listed programs:

Java compiler (written in Java), compiling big program: 2.5 MB

HotJava browser (written in Java), after running some applets: 4.0 MB

"Hello world" Java program (no GUI): 800K
