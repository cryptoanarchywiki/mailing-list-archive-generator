I hope my mail didn't give the impression that we are "insisting" on this. 
It's a matter of technical expedience at the moment, that's all.  Non-US
sellers who really want to use FV can do so today IF they get a US bank
account.  Payout through non-US banks is definitely something we plan to
do, but you can't build a business today on our plans for tomorrow,
especially since we don't have a firm target date.

One of the relatively easiest alternatives we have discussed is good old
fashioned paper checks.  We could *conceivably* (this is not a promise!)
set up a system to pay non-US sellers by mailing them paper checks.  This
is a fairly expensive process, and we'd have to pass on the costs to the
sellers in the form of a service charge for the mailing, and there would be
postal delays, and there would be a delay waiting for your local bank to
clear a US check.  Is this appealing?  -- Nathaniel
