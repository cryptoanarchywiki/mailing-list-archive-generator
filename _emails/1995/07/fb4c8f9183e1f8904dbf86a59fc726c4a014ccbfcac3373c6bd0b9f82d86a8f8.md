The Boston Globe has a weekly "magazine review" column.  In yesterday's
column they wrote about the Rimm piece, Time's followup, how the Internet
got the story right, and fast, and how HotWired has a really good page
on it.  The column then reviewed the current Wired and said the magazine
is now behind the times.  In particular, contrasting it to the second(?)
issue, "when they covered the Cypherpunks (sic) and their privacy agenda."
