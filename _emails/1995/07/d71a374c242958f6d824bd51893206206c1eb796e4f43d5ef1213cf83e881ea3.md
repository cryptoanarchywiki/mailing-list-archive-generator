Unless I'm mistaken, Telescript was part of General Magic's technology.
Besides the language deficiencies, IMHO, they would release almost
nothing to the general developers, much less a sample implementation
to be ported.  It's almost impossible to develop for: you need a souped
up MAC, a developer PDA, etc...

(I'm talking about Magic Cap (the OS) development in which I think the
language was called Telescript.)

Compared to a powerful Unix development environment (if and when it gets
ported to Linux, HPUX, or SGI that I use...(no longer in a Sun shop),
it really seem awful.  It was also very buggy as late as mid last
year.

OTOH, I wrote a piece of software that interprets the raw async data from
satellite and chops it into articles.  (Reuters special feed for Magic
Cap clients...)
