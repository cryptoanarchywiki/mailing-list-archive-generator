Agreed, things may be rough for the folks profiting from the current
intellectual property laws. But many nations don't agree with our notions
of what is one's intellectual property.

("Galombosians" believe one's _ideas_ are one's property, subject to
collection of fees. "You mentioned "remailers"...please remit $1.33
to....")

I think you're making the point: machines on the Net are getting much, much
cheaper, which will make "Mom and Pop remailers" much more common.

Importantly, these remailers will be common--someday, if not this year--in
non-U.S. jurisdictions.

The growth of Net and Web services has been astounding, even to me (someone
whose first Arpanet account was in 1973). This will put Cypherpunks
services into many more places.
