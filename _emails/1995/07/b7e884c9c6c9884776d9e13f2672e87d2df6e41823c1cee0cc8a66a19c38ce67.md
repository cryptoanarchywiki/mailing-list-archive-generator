Looking for a secure rlogin?
Want to deter IP-spoofing, DNS-spoofing, and routing-spoofing?
Want to run X11 connections and TCP/IP ports securely over an insecure network?
Worried about your privacy?
Then read this.


Introducing SSH (Secure Shell) Version 1.0


Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program to log into another computer over a
network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files
from one machine to another.  It provides strong authentication and
secure communications over insecure channels.  Its features include
the following:

   o    Strong authentication.  Closes several security holes (e.g., IP,
	routing, and DNS spoofing and listening for passwords from the
	network).  New authentication methods: .rhosts together with
	RSA based host authentication, and pure RSA authentication.

   o    All communications are automatically and transparently
        encrypted.  Encryption is also used to protect against spoofed
        packets.

   o    X11 connection forwarding provides secure X11 sessions.

   o    Arbitrary TCP/IP ports can be redirected over the encrypted
        channel in both directions.

   o    Client RSA-authenticates the server machine in the beginning of
        every connection to prevent trojan horses (by routing or DNS
        spoofing) and man-in-the-middle attacks, and the server RSA-
        authenticates the client machine before accepting .rhosts or
        /etc/hosts.equiv authentication (to prevent DNS, routing, or IP
        spoofing).

   o    An authentication agent, running in the user's local workstation
        or laptop, can be used to hold the user's RSA authentication
        keys.

   o    Multiple convenience features fix annoying problems with rlogin
        and rsh.

   o    Complete replacement for rlogin, rsh, and rcp.


Ssh is freely available, and may be used by anyone (see the file
COPYING in the distribution for more details).  There is no warranty
of any kind, and patents may restrict your right to use this software
in some countries.

Ssh is currently available for anonymous ftp at the following locations
   ftp.funet.fi:/pub/unix/security/ssh-1.0.0.tar.gz
   ftp.cs.hut.fi:/pub/ssh/ssh-1.0.0.tar.gz

Please let me know if you willing to have your site act as a
distribution site.  (US sites warning: although this software was
developed outside the United States using information available in any
major bookstore or scientific library worldwide, it is illegal to
export anything containing cryptographic software from the United
States.  Putting this openly available for ftp in the US may make you
eligible for charges on ITAR violations, with penalties up to 10 years
in prison.  French and Russian sites warning: it may be illegal to use
or even posses this software in your country, because your government
wants to be able to monitor all conversations of its citizens.)

There is a WWW home page for ssh: http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh.

There is a mailing list for ssh.  Send mail to ssh-request@clinet.fi
to get instructions (or mail directly to majordomo@clinet.fi with
"subscribe ssh" in body).


All official distributions of ssh are accompanied by a pgp signature
by the key "pub  1024/DCB9AE01 1995/04/24 Ssh distribution key
<ylo@cs.hut.fi>".  (Included below.)
