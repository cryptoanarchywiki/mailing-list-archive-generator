   Mountain View, Ca., July 18 -- With the support of Intuit
   and MasterCard International, Netscape Communications has
   announced Secure Courier, an open, cross-platform digital
   envelope. The new protocol allows secure transfer of credit
   card, debit card and micro-transactions across the
   Internet.

   Secure Courier is an open, cross-platform protocol, meaning
   it will operate in Macintosh, Windows, and Unix operating
   environments common to Internet traffic. Specifications for
   this new protocol are currently available from Netscape's
   World Wide Web site at

      http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/credit.html .

   New York, NY, July 18 -- American Express' Travel Related
   Services Company said it is establishing relationships with
   four technology companies for secure Internet credit card
   transactions using the American Express card and the Optima
   card.

   The four companies involved, CyberCash, First Virtual
   Holdings, Netscape Communications Corporation, and Open
   Market, have different ways of securing transactions over
   The Internet's World Wide Web.
