To any interested party:

I need 3 simple DOS scripts to be writter or translated from a UNIX 
script to DOS. The scripts need to do the following:

1) Look into a specific directory and execute a .bat file that will 
sign encrypt the file(s) in the directory using Viacrypt's PGP and wipe 
out the original.  It then needs to move the cyphertext file(s) to a 
second directory.

2) The second script needs to log on to a netcom account, enter user id 
and password and upload the cyphertext files in the second directory 
using Z-modem transpher.  The netcom account is already programmed to 
mail the files to the correct address.  It then needs to logout and 
move the transfered files to a third directory.

3) The 3rd script needs to delete all files in the third directory that 
are over 15 days old on the 1st and 15th of each month.

The first two scripts need to run on a timer and in sequential order on 
a daily basis.  

That's it.

If you are interested, let me know and I will fill you in on specific 
details. Also include a proposed charge for the programming.

Thanks.
