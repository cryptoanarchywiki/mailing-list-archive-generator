It's the other way around.  Anything that does encryption that they _haven't_
explicitly given you permission to export, or that isn't subject to subtle
and arguable interpretations of the law (or blatantly obvious interpretations
of the First Amendment) is verboten.  So buy your crypto stuff overseas,
and import it, and write letters to your COngresscritters about how annoyed
you are that you have to do this.  Might as well send them a bill for the extra
expenses you've had to incur; they won't pay it, of course, but it should 
amuse some of the Republicans....
