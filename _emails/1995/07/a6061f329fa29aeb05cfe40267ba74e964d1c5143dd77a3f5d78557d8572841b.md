Could it be that they were using the pads more than once?  That's the
simplest flaw I can imagine.

Gee, why did it take a squad of codebreakers to come to the conclusion
that the Soviets sought to steal atomic secrets?  I mean, couldn't
they just kinda scratch their heads and decide it was highly unlikely
that the Soviets *wouldn't* do it?  And why would they need to "crack"
the code at all?  Seems like they could do some controlled information
leaks and then do some traffic flow analysis via whatever known
communications channels operatives were believed to use; all they
needed was grounds for suspicion, after all.

I assume there's a lot about this not revealed yet, or not clear from
the brief synopsis above.
