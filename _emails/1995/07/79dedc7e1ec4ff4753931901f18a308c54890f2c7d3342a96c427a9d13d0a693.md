As a security measure, I am trying to get a massive dictionary of words
together, and each time a user changes his/her password, it checks the list to
see if the password is in it.  My question is, are there any pre-built lists of
this nature?  I am currently only using a spelling dictoinary, and would like
somthing a little bigger.
