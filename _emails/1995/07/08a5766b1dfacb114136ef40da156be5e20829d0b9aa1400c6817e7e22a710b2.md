Bet you 10-1 that "Computer Network" as implemented in the new bill will 
refer to any computing system that could possibly defend /itself/ through 
common carrier status.  IE including small non-networked fringe BBSs that 
attempt to claim "common carrier" status.

And many networks that don't claim common carrier status, too.

The real solution to the crypto-legalization problem is anonymity.  
Seeing as I've not checked the bill out yet, nor am I a lawyer, I can't 
say what the implications for that are.  If there are anti-remailer 
implications, the solution may be to build tools with "security flaws" 
(ie remailing capability).  I know that this has been discussed before, 
but this is the time to implement it.  Obviously, the information about 
the "security holes" will have to be spread widely, but the flaws will 
have to be built so deep in the design as to not be removable.

In addition, now is the time to deploy stego, on a massive scale.  How 
many stego programs have been released for Unix?  Can these be integrated 
with mailing programs in the same way that PGP has been?

What would be the legal liability of the maintainer of a common-carrier 
status system that had a guest account which had been (or based on the 
current legislation) could be used for anonymity/crypto stuff?  If he's 
liable, does this mean that system administrators are liable for any 
potential security hole in their system that a random evil internet 
hacker uses to abuse another system?  Hmmm... Usenet 
alt.binaries.pictures.barney + stego software + unmaintained 'guest' 
account on a random system = ???

Any lawyers?
Jon
