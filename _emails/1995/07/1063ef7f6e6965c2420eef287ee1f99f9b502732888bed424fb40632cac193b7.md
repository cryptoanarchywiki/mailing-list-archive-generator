[[ This is another reason why I think Java is worth looking into --
   on one hand, there will always be free tools available, in addition
   to commercial tools; on the other hand, it is being strongly
   supported by SUN ]]


The SUN Sacramento Training Center announces the following FREE courses.

The Java Programming Series: #1 An Overview of the Java Language
The Java Programming Series: #2 Accessing Data Files
The Java Programming Series: #3 Simple GUI Applications
The Java Programming Series: #4 Program-to-Program Communication
The Java Programming Series: #5 Applets Design and Implementation
The Java Programming Series: #6 Accessing an Oracle RDBMS

Each course is:
  - 2 hours in length (they always start at 9:00 AM on Fridays)
  - fast paced
  - an introduction to the course topic
  - FREE

It is assumed that each student:
  - knows C and/or C++ language syntax
  - has a basic understanding of object oriented programming
  - has a personality that enjoys taking a jump-start course and then
    learning the rest of the technology via projects, newsgroups, and
    email-alias discussions.


You should NOT attend this class if:

  You are a techno-weenie.

  You are already an experienced JAVA programmer.
