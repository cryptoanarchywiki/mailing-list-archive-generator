>> 		 ATF SUMMER CAMP A HOTBED OF RACIAL HATE
>> 
>> The Washington Times (7/11/95) reports that despite a pending lawsuit 
>> against the ATF for racism, a summer camp for ATF agents called the 
>> "Good O' Boys Roundup" was still awash with racist sentiment. 
>> 
>> All who attended were welcomed at the entrance with many racist signs,
>> including one that read: 
>> 
>>                         "Nigger Check Point" 
>> 
>> The ATF camp maintains a whites only policy. All black ATF agents who
>> attempted to attend were turned away. White agents inside were reportedly
>> "real mad" about the attempts of black agents to attend. That the signs
>> were hung at the entrance indicates that all who attended had no problem
>> with the ATF's promotion of hard-core racism at the retreat. 
>> 
>> There were many T-shirts promoting racial hatred and murder on sale at the
>> ATF summer camp, such as one with a target superimposed over the face of
>> Martin Luther King Jr. It would seem that the ATF approves of the killing
>> of Dr. King. 
>> 
>> Also available at the ATF hate camp were "Nigger Hunting Licenses." 
>> If promoting the murder of black leaders is not bad enough, ATF agents
>> even promote random killings of blacks. 
>> 
>> In a vain attempt to distance the ATF from the promotion of racial hate
>> and murder at the ATF summer camp, ATF spokesman Earl Woodham claimed the
>> event has never been sanctioned by the ATF. However, for years the local 
>> ATF office has been the place to send in registration fees and to call 
>> for info about the ATF summer hate camp. The agents at this office declined
>> to say if they ever attended one of the "round ups" over the years. 
>> 
>> One ATF official said "I am not surprised about the signs or other
activities 
>> [at the camp]."  A former law enforcement officer who has attended the 
>> camp this year and in the past said, "The roundup has been a place for law
>> enforcement personnel to go and let their hair down." So it would seem that
>> hatred and a lust for murdering oppressed people reflects the true nature
>> of these "law enforcement" personnel. "Jack-booted thugs" is soft-balling it.
>> 
>> The pending lawsuit launched by 15 plaintiffs charges that KKK information
>> and "Nigger Hunting Licenses" have been displayed in many ATF offices. The
>> suit also claims widespread racial slurs and harassment by ATF personnel.
>> 
>> All information presented here is derived from The Washington Times
>> (7/11/95) front page article "Racist ways die hard at lawmen's retreat."
>> 
>> PLEASE RE-POST FAR AND WIDE
