I'm absolutely dying to do that with cops around here (N.VA/Tysons) area...

I got a ticket at 2:30 AM while my car was on cruise at 55MPH, almost
no hills, guy said he 'paced' me for about a mile doing 70 2-3 miles
before he stopped me, yet he was too lazy to use his radar...
I paid $40 and spent a few hours getting an officially certified
speedometer test, etc.

Still trying to go to court: first date was for July 3rd, which they
decided at the last minute to take as vacation, told me to appear
July 5th, when I found out that the continuance was for Aug 9.  (For
a June 5th or so ticket.

After 50 calls to the court house trying to get through, I found out
that the officers don't even have to turn in paperwork unless I don't
pay the bond and then they just turn it in 4-5 days before the court
date.

The parking meter at the courthouse was fraudulent (20 min for my $.25 for
30 min fee), and I've noted numerous speeding and illegal Uturns, parking
in active roadway's without lights, etc. offences by local police...
