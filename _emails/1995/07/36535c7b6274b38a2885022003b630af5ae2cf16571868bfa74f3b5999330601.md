If ultra conservatives are folk who only increase school lunch 
funding by 4.5% (reducing the planned increase by 0.8%), who 
reduce the marriage penalty by $500, reduce government 
controlled broadcasting by 8%, and so forth,


What then would you call people who would reduce the marriage 
penalty by $4000, abolish school lunch funding, and end 
government controlled broadcasting.

Lunatic fringe ultra Nazis?
