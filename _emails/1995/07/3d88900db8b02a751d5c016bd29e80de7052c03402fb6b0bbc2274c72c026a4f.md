Instead of that, send H(pid,clock,hostname,H(password)) to the server, for
some hash function H().  Then the server only needs to keep H(password) 
around, rather than the plain password.  This is similar to current
systems, except the plain password isn't sent across the network.

H() can be whatever you fancy; 25 crypts, MD5, SHA-1, etc.  Of course,
I'm sure this is far from being a new idea....
