Cypherpunks,

It was my intention to write a little summary of the story in the most 
recent issue of SCIENCE, which in addition to reporting some progress 
towards constructing a quantum computer, also reports in a side bar on 
a Los Alamos demonstration of untappable quantum cryptography in which a 
message was sent over 14 kilometers of fiberoptic cable and read with a 
1% error rate, secure in the knowledge that Eve couldn't possible be 
listening.

However, I have not gotten any mail from the list today which leads me to 
believe that there is something wrong with the list-server, you couldn't 
all possible have been struck dumb with terror by the Your-ass-is 
Grassley Act :-)

So this is a test, this is only a test.  Had this been a real message I 
would have sent more details about the stuff in SCIENCE.
