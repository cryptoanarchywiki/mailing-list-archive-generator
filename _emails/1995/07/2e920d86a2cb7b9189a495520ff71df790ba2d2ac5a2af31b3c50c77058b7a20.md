	Incidentally, the FV terms of service prohibit the sale of
material goods using FV as a payment system.  Its intended for selling
information, not physical products.  This is reflected in the fact
that the seller takes multiple risks of non-payment.

	You could probably get away with selling individualized,
signed tokens redeemable for a t-shirt after 30 days to mitigate your
risk, abide by FV's TOS, and make the buyers happy, but this seems
like a lot of work to use FV.
