You're parsing the title wrong.  It's an act to support racketeering
through opposition to electronic communications.  What viruses have to
do with encryption is that encryption makes it easier to prevent viruses,
and Senator Grassley wants to stop that.  And the term "strong" was used in its
correct engineering meaning, as in "It's a vessel of fertilizer which is
very strong and promotes growth".

Yup.  Quite so.

Hey, Julf, we've got your number!  And we're making sure nobody's got any
encryption to prevent fraud with.

As above.
