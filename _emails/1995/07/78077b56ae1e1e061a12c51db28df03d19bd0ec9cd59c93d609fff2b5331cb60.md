As I'm sure you know, PGP picks its primes by choosing a random starting 
point and testing each odd number upwards until it gets a probable 
prime.  The random number generator used to seed this search is mixed 
using MD5 which gives a uniform 1/0 distribution.  I'd hazard a guess 
that the chances of a start point having so many contiguous 1's as to be 
close to 2^N is so vanishingly small that it's more likely a 
non-prime would pass the probabalistic tests!

I suppose if I were really paranoid I'd feed in fixed starting points
for the search to MIT PGP and PGP 2.6.2 to make sure that they come out 
with the same keys.
