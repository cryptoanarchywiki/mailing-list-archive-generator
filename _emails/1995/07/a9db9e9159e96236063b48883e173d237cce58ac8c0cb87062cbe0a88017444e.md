No. Export of crypto to Canada is legal because Canada prohibits the
further export of goods of U.S. origin. Before the Canadian government
will allow further export of crypto software from the U.S., there must
be lot of improvement done to the product within Canada. The exact
rules are not well defined, but with crypto I expect that the CSE
(Communications Security Establishment -- our version of the NSA)
would push for at least 50% Canadian content. So I don't expect to
see PGP being exported legally any time soon.

I have talked with the bureaucrat that I think you are referring
to, and he said no such thing. He said that public domain crypto
software that is entirely of Canadian origin was, in his opinion
not covered. When I talked to him, he stressed that PGP is still
covered.
