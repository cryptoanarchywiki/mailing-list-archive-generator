   7-14-95. NYPaper:


   "U.S. Spells Out Antitrust Inquiry Into Microsoft."

      The Justice Department said today that the Microsoft
      Corporation might well be violating antitrust laws by
      including software for its new on-line network in
      Windows 95, its much-anticipated operating system for
      personal computers.                            JUS_kid


   "Sting on Internet Leads to a Child Sex Case."

      In a case involving child pornography, the Internet and
      a self-appointed enforcer whom one critical defense
      lawyer calls an "electronic vigilante," a Nevada man is
      facing prison for crossing state lines with the
      intention of having sex with a 14 year-old girl he had
      met on a popular computer network.             SHE_dev


   [Editorial] "The Guns of Waco and Ruby Ridge."

      There is little doubt that the Federal Government
      contributed heavily to two of the biggest law
      enforcement fiascoes in recent memory. One was the
      disastrous 1993 Federal raid on the Branch Davidian
      compound at Waco, Tex. The other was the tragic 1992
      encounter between the F.B.I. and a band of white
      separatists at Ruby Ridge, Idaho.              LIT_bub
