When I stuck that comment in I had in mind the message that appeared here 
in the list from someone at maspar.com, where their machines make our 
workstations look rather pedestrian.  Agreed, though, Alpha's are nice 
(I'm typing this message on one).

The Pentium's integer performance in general is very good, right up there 
with the more expensive Sparc according to the figures I saw in one of 
the linux newsgroups a while back.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said 
for the relative performance of its FPU, Intel needs to do a lot of work 
there to catch up.
