I was just talking with a friend, and had the most vile thought.

Mallet works part time for the Justice Department.  His job is
entrapment of random individuals.  He has a Web server running the
Netscape Commerce Server.

When a potential victim is lured into looking at Mallet's home page with
Mozilla, the poor sap is rewarded by a server-side push of some small
piece of contraband software.  Many victims will simply move off the
page, forgetting that the document is now in their Netscape cache.
They're toast.  Others might clear their cache, but the server still
shows that the file was sent.  They're now guilty of both receiving and
concealing contraband.  And maybe destruction of evidence and/or
interfering with law enforcement.

I'm only raving like this because the whole Anti-Racketeering bill has
me both scared and really pissed off.
