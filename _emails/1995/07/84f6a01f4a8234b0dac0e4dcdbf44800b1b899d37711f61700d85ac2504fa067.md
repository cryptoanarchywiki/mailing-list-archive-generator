A legitimate point; however, the majority of PC users won't be in the 
vanguard of /anything/ -- it's not the nature of the PC industry.  If all 
the Unix folks do it, then the PC folks might.

Besides, the first was the point I was making; the second, I was 
personally interested, because, after all, I run unix.

In addition, many of the PC people who do Internet communications do it 
through a unix server anyway.  So it would be beneficial.
