I guess I'm still confused about why there's an X-Attachment: header being
added. If the file is being generated by MacPGP without using the Applescript,
you can simply open the resulting encoded file (provided it is being ascii-
armored) from within Eudora then copy and paste it into an open Compose
window. Voila. No X-Attachment: header. If you delete the file name on the
attachments line, it also removes the attachment.

Mr. Unicorn: have you had any luck with the Applescript? You might try
booting without extensions (except for Applescript) and open Eudora
off-line and keep trying. 

Hope this helps,
Steve
