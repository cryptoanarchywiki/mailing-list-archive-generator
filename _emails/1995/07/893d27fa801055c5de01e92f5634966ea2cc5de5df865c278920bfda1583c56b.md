I'm feel that this type of banking is just around the corner with the coming
tidal wave of internet based commerce.

My primary concern would be something along this senario ... 

I open an account with U.S. $$ in a foreign bank who uses francs (don't
flame the denonimation or the choice this is just an exammple ;-) ... a month 
later the franc loses 20 % of it's value as compared to the U.S. dollar. If I 
close out my account would I not lose 20% of my money because when the money was 
deposited it was credited to the account in francs ... and when it is withdrawn 
it converted back to $$ at the current conversion rate ? Maybe this was answered 
in the previous reply if so call me *thick* if not call me *paranoid*.
