I won't suggest that others change their favorite programs, but here are
the facts:

- -All URLs in Newswatcher can be accessed by cmd-clicking them.

- -V.A. and Y.A. Newswatcher provides transparent use of anonymous remailers
for both news and email. A feature that most cypherpunks will appreciate
and that Netscape does not provide.
<ftp://mirrors.aol.com//pub/info-mac/comm/tcp/ya-newswatcher-20b28.hqx>

- -In Macs with InternetConfig
<ftp://mirrors.aol.com//pub/info-mac/comm/tcp/internet-config-11.hqx> and
the latest ICeTEe extension
<ftp://redback.cs.uwa.edu.au//Others/Quinn/Config/InternetConfig1.1.sit>
installed, all programs that use TextEdit, such as Eudora and SimpleText,
become browsers that allow instant access to any URL mentioned in the text
just by cmd-clicking on it. Netscape doesn't even come close.
