Obscura is suffering from HD troubles. The backups have failed so I am going to have to
rebuild it from scratch. This means that the web page and remailer will be down.
All mail to the remailers will be lost. I have changed the name server so
I will still get mail sent to loki@obscura.com.

	-Lance
