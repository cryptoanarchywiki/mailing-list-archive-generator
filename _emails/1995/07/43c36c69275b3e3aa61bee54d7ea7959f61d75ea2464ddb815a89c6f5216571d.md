Perry, I don't understand.  If the least significant bits in my gif file
follow all the "known statistical distributions", how can anyone know 
whether they are "just noise" or are an encrypted message, (asymmetric or 
symmetric, either one) unless they have the key?  Why can't there be public 
key steganography?  Perhaps existing tools are inadequate, but are they
impossible?
