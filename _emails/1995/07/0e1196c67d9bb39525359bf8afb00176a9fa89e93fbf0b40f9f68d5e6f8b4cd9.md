It seems to me that this bill is so broad as to be unworkable, and that
could work in our favor.  I haven't read the full text, and I'm not a
lawyer, but my reading of the excerpts posted here suggest that even stuff
that's been *approved* for export by NSA could be prohibited. 

What would be the status of stuff like NIS+ under this bill?  The 
Netscape commerce server?
