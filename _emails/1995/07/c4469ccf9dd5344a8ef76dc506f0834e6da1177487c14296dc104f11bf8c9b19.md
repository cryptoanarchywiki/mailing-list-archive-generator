Having experience using American Spectator as a source for research 
papers, I can state without any doubt in my mind that anything I read in 
AS I attempt to find proof of their claims somewhere else.

Not to say that Freeh is good, or that the claims aren't true this time 
(I haven't read it, yet..), but their articles in the past have had 
glaring lies^H^H^H^H inaccuracies.  It's like reading the traditional 
liberal media... they'll twist anything to fit their preconceptions.
