Oh dear.  There are certain smut pages in Germany.  They were showing
them on TV recently, but I couldn't quite catch the URL.  I can see it
now -- the US government censors the net to keep out the Germans (but
the tourists can still come -- hey, at an average of $80K/year annual
income, they're welcome to go shopping in New York, though if they
want to change clothes on the beach they have to do *that* in
California, Florida is right out, eh Lawton?) and the Germans censor
the net to keep out the Americans.   Oh dear.
