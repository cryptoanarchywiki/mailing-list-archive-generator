Only two callers through, first one should have hung up when he heard
all of his arguments made (better) in the first half hour.  Second
caller asked whether the Pynchon mailing list he's on would have to
censor itself if the Exon ammendment passed (seemed a decent point -
succinct too).

The rest of the time was the same old political debate with a few
moments about Surfwatch.  Equal time given to the opposition, who
spoke about the horrors of unspeakable besiality, rape, etc.
