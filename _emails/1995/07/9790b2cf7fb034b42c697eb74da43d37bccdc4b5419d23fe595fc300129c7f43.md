If they are a Licensed Interchange Carrier they must (by law) provided
call records and caller id information on court order. If they fail to
answer the court order they could loose the right to operate as a LIC.
If they are not a fully licensed carrier, they can have all equipment 
impounded if they do not honor the court order. Ask anyone who knows 
telco-law. 

Let's say you call someone with call-id and do something silly like
tell them "I'm going to kill you and your boyfriend, leave my bloody
glove at the scene and drive away in my white ford bronco." 

This scares them. The person calls the cops. 

The cops call the number on caller id. They track down the service and
tell the service- "Give up the call records or get closed down."

What do you think the carrier will do?

I say this all the time, if you want privacy- Don't use the phone.

Here are some things I've heard: (Not responsible for blah blah...)

1) Most caller ID equipment will not display Caller ID from calls 
 made at IDSN phones. 

2) Most digital cell-phones have the same quirk.

3) Call-id does not work when calls are made from digital PBXs in 
 Japan.

4) Call-id does not work when calls are made from digital PBXs in most 
 parts of east-block Europe.

5) This happens only in Nynex land and will be fixed by 1997. (yes, 1997)
