Cypherpunks can do more by being cypherpunks.  Your keyboards are
better weapons than checkbooks in this case.  Why isn't PGP so simple
that every luzer on AOL will use it without thinking?  Why hasn't
the NetScape key been broken?  Prove these proposed laws are just as
silly and ineffective as they look by demonstrating it.

Lots of people will attack these laws on legal grounds, and you should
too if your conscience so moves you, but very few have the
capabilities to attack them on technical grounds where their
vulnerabilities are real, not just a matter of opinion.
