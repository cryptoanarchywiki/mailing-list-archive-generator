Hooking up a mass mailer to congress seems like a bad idea to me, because
they're really only interested in their constituants. If they start getting
mass mailings, they might start thinking there's only one person or a
small group of people "behind the curtain". Sending results of an e-petition,
however, would be unobtrusive. A web page that mails a form letter to
_your_ congressperson's form-letter-readers (ie staff readers) would be
much better, IMHO.
