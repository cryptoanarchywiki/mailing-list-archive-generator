Personally, I think the whole recent debate here about Java, Netscape, TCL,
Safe-TCL, Telescript, Linux, etc., has been very useful and stimulating.
The detailed exposition of ideas by Ray Cromwell, Doug Barnes, Hal Finney,
and several others is exactly what this list is all about.

Ray's list of the many applet-based applications (so to speak). this stuff
Doug is working on, and Hal's ideas, all could lead to a next-generation of
Web-oriented user tools.

I have no idea, of course, which of the various languages and tools will
succeed. But it's good to see so much interest the past year or two in new
languages...it was looking for a while like C++ would be the only game in
town.
