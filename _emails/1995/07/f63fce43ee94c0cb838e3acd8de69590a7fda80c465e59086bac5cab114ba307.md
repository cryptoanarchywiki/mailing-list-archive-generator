Yes, and some vendors will be in state (sales tax) & some out of state (no
sales tax). Furthermore, if the vendor is in state but in a different locale,
there will probably be some difference in sales tax rates as rates within
states are usually based on vendor location. Also some types of purchases
for some types of businesses/organizations/entities have various sales tax
exemptions or surcharges, again all of which varies by state & locality.
ALL of these factors will skew the distribution, eg. sales tax is usualy
*.00% or *.25%, *.50%, *.75% etc. so a cursory look shows that 0 & 5 will
be over represented due to this factor.
