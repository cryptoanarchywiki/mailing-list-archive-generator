Actually... this sounds like a GREAT IDEA!!! Do you know how many cops you 
could catch with one of those??? I cannot count the times I've had cops go by
me at speeds in excess of 80 mph without lights or sirens! Everyone ought to 
check one of those things out, catch the cops and turn it in to your local media
establisment!
