No refs, this is just memory of the news.  There was an undersea cable
north of Siberia somewhere that carried a lot of unencrypted military
traffic, which US Submarines were eavesdropping on.  I think Walker was
the one who leaked it, and they started encrypting.  Refs on the Walkers
should be easy to find in the library; there were a couple of books.

Yes, with government-provided evidence, and with the government withholding
inconvenient evidence.  There was a story on KPFA radio in the last week or so
covering an article on the Rosenbergs in some lefty magazine, probably The
Nation,
by a couple who have been strong supporters of them for years, and are now
saying that "sorry, friends, it looks like Julius _was_ spying, though not
atomically".
