  Ah.  No big deal then.  After stegoing, you sign the GIF.

  Sending multiple copies of the same GIF would go a long way toward
solving this, if X% and Y% were low enough. Say I get 5 copies, and
reconstruct the origial via a "voting" protocol. Also, if we break down
the file into smaller blocks, and sign each block individually, we can
narrow down the errors.

  But I am having a real problem with an overt policy of fiddling with
people's mail. If they did that, it would likely cause a huge backlash
that would be felt at the ballot box.
