- From the top of my head:
Subpoena your service provider's computer records.  Intimidate your roommate
into testifying against you.  Tapping your phone.  Entrapping you into
doing it.

Feds are in the business of putting people behind bars.  They are _very_ good
at it.

I'm betting that the Feds will adopt as a working definition anything that
requires a key to decrypt the communications.  That means compression
software, rot13, and most hash functions are ok.

This is the U.S. Government.  They Have Forms.  You just file form
THX1138/KGB666-007, omitting pages 113-115 and substituting Addendum Foxtrot
Uniform Delta; then you're covered.

It's the Halting Problem, in English.

Expert Testimony:  "We experimented with 113,296 keys chosen at random and
the defendants algorithm took an average of 29,000 years to find each one.
It is our professional opinion, therefore, that the defendant is jacking us
around and ought to be keelhauled".


ObPGP:

Incidentally, did you know that PGP puts a "- " in front of a line that
begins with the word "From"?  Just so "sendmail" doesn't hose your
signatures, I spoz.
