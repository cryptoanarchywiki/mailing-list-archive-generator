This wasn't really my point.  Grassley's bill implies that uploading crypto
to an overseas FTP site would qualify as a predicate act, needed for a RICO
seizure.  I think he is assuming that someone would do this for the
purposes of making money: and that anything bought with that money would be
RICOable.  I don't think he or anyone else in Congress is aware that people
tend to do this stuff for free.

I remember one of the sponsors of the CDA ranting about pornographers
"profiteering" from pornographic images on the Internet, blissfully unaware
that stuff downloaded from alt.sex.binaries.insert.your.fetish.here doesn't
profit anyone but the phone company (for the hours you stay online to get
it).

So I'm wondering who this RICO stuff applies to.  The guy who wrote it and
uploaded it to an FTP site?  He's not profiting.  The guy who uses it? He
didn't commit the predicate act.  Who?
