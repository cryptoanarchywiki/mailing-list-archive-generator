   The New Yorker, July 24, 1995:


   "Twilight of the Goddess." A critical look at Ayn Rand and
   her work.

      Thirteen years after Rand's death, her books still sell
      more than three hundred thousand copies a year. Not
      since the popular novels of almost a century before,
      bent on refutations of Darwin or God, and offering what
      George Eliot called "a complete theory of life and
      manual of divinity, in a love story," had there appeared
      so vividly accessible and reassuring a guide for the
      cosmically perplexed. As late as 1991, the Library of
      Congress found that a majority of Americans surveyed
      named "Atlas Shrugged" as the book that had most
      influenced their lives, after the Bible.
