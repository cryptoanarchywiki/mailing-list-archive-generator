This is a forward of something I just cross-posted to alt.security.pgp,
and talk.politics.crypto.  Civil disobedience via illegal .sigs.

You all know about the ridiculous US regulation called ITAR and how it
applies to crypto software in the US, well here's a fun and relatively
safe (YMMV) way for you to export PGP in protest.

It is just a token effort, and of 0 practical significance, but the
idea is that you just post 3 lines of the uuencoded zipped DOS PGP
executable in place of your usual sig in protest.  If they lock you up
for 3 uuencoded lines which came off a European ftp site and European
web page, then well they are stupid.  More to the point it would make
them (the US state department and the NSA) look stupid.

Take a look at this web page:

	http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/export/

it will dole out uuencoded parts of PGP.EXE (the DOS binary for
pgp2.6.2i, the international version of PGP, as is available from
myriads of non-US ftp sites).

See my sig for a sample, the first in a long stream hopefully,

And remember, say NO to key escrow :-)
