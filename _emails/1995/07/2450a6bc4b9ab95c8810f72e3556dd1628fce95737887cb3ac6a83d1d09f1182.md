I don't know if anyone has taken this into consideration:  several people
have noted that the anti-racket-whatever bill doesn't have too much chance
of getting out of committee because its wording is a bit, well, broad. 
It's being reviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee.  This is a problem 
for us, because Sen. Grassley is the chair of that committee.

His e-mail address is chuck_grassley@grassley.senate.gov, fire away!
