You oughta go out and borrow someone's shortwave radio or ham HF radio. 
Between 3900 and 3900 KHz every evening, a bunch of guys in the south
(Texas, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana) get on the air and talk about the
"goddamn niggers, jews, and fags that are ruining this country."  All
kinds of folks (meaning non-WASPs, of course) are targeted for this kind
of spew.  Words like "motherfucker" are often used, especially against
"niggers".  The speakers rail against "white women with goddamn niggers",
and any other non-WASP who happens to arouse their ire. 

Quite entertaining if you enjoy that sort of thing.  Stomach-turning if
you don't.  Call signs, times and frequencies heard upon request. 

This sort of thing has been going on for years.  A few years back, the FCC
attempted to go after a couple of idiots on one of the local LA area 2m
repeaters who were spewing all kinds of filth out onto the air waves.  The
district court said, naaah, that's free speech. 

So, if the idiots in Congress want to go after this sort of thing, they
oughts go after the few hams that are ruining the hobby for the rest of
us.
