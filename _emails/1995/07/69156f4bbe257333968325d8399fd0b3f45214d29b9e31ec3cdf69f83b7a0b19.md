Speaking for myself, of course, I used Newswatcher _before_ using
Netscape's newsreader.

I've been using Eudora since early on, in 1992, via my Netcom shell
account. And Eudora Pro since it came out. Now I use it on my PPP account,
but the functionality is essentially the same as when I was using a shell
account.

As for Newswatcher, see above. As for other non-Netscape tools, I also have
MacWAIS, Anarchie, TurboGopher, Finger, NCSA Telnet, Talk, etc. I use
specialized tools when the need arises.

But Eudora + Netscape meet most of my Net needs, which are for doing mail,
reading and posting to News, fetching files, checking out Web sites, etc.

I'm not saying this combination meets the needs of everyone, and their
mileage will likely vary, but I do dislike arguments of the flavor: "Ah,
Tim, wait until you learn what a real computer is, wait until you see
what's out there besides Netscape."
