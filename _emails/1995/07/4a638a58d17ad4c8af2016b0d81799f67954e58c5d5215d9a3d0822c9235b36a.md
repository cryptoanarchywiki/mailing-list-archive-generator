It isn't only clearing latency that's a problem. FV has already
taken over 5 days to deal with a simple account problem.

Latency might be a Good Thing(tm) in remailers, but it's a
Bad Thing(tm) in financial services. It's a "repuation market"
kinda thing. First Virtual is starting to fall down on many counts.
I'd have paid more if I could have found a place that would have
cleared things faster.

And....inasmuch as these are "real-time" computers we're dealing
with here on the net, bad transacions and fraud can be stopped cold.
Or with only minor losses, at the very most.

Love Always,

Carol Anne
