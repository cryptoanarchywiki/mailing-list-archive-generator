Au contraire. I finally got the chance to use Netscape, and although I AM
impressed, I still prefer Lynx. Most folks will probably call this pointless
stubborness, elitism, I don't care. Graphics are too damn slow at any
speed and personally, I have no need (or desire) to have my net connection
slow to a snail's crawl just to make it "look nicer". 

Text mode looks just fine to me. It's the content that matters.
