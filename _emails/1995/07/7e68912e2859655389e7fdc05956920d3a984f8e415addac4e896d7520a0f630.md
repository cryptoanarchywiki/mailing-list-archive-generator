I'd hardly call my view "throwing in the towel." What I said clearly enough
was that the Washingtonians can throw out repressive legislation much
faster than we can--and I speak in terms of "we" as being the EFF, EPIC,
NRA, ACLU, etc., and _not_ the Cyherpunks, who have no lobbying activities
to speak of.

Indeed, this law makes the Cypherpunks group a co-conspirator. (In the same
way that the recent Omnibus Anti-Terrorism (or whatever it's callled)
criminalizes groups which support This Year's Enemies. (Like the War with
Oceania--or was it Eurasia?--the friend of today was yesterday's criminal
organization. For example, the Omnibus bill makes support of anti-PLO
groups a crime, for foreigners, as the PLO is now, this year, our "Partner
for Peace.")

This is all I'm suggesting, that yet another round of trying to persuade
Congress people is a waste, and that the _traditional_ focus on technology
is a better use of our time and effort.

Others are welcome to do as they wish. I'm just expressing my view that
Washington can spin out legislation faster than we can respond....they are,
after all, using our tax dollars to generate new laws, and have
intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies on their side with
armies of lawyers and lobbyists to help. Multi-billion dollar budgets are
also at stake.

The lobbyists for preserving liberty are few and far between.

Some would say this means Cypherpunks should step into the fray and become
a lobbying group. I don't see us as having the structure or organization to
become such a group. Those who wish to should probably form a real group to
do this, with bylaws and elected officials.

Anarchies are great, but there's no way an anarchy can have a "spokesman,"
or a budget for travel and lobbying, or a hundred other things that a
lobbying group needs. Cypherpunks--this list--is just not in a position to
be this group.
