My assertion regarding weakness of the key generation algorithm was not
related to the response you gave.  As a result, it appears that you are
avoiding the issue.  This looks bad if you are, as you claim, maintaining
a legitimate algorithm.  Perhaps you would be better served by addressing
the specifics of my comments - to wit: What makes you think PGPs method
of getting seeds does not lead to a limited key space that is within the
realm of modern computers to search?

	Your assertion that I could find the backdoor by inspecting the
program is the wrong tactic for secure programs.  If you want people to
believe that a program is secure, you had better come up with good
reasons that it is secure, and not hide behind "if you can't find any
holes, it must be secure".

	Clever back doors are not accomplished by an obvious program
change, but rather by the subtle use of some technique that appears to
do one thing when it actually does something else.  As a good example, a
subtle interation with the rest of the environment could modify the key
generation algorithm after it is loaded.  Unfortunately, PGP is too
large to verify against such back doors, so I ask again:

	Why (specifically) do you think the MIT version of PGP has no
backdoors and is not subject to attacks such as the one outlined in my
previous posting?
