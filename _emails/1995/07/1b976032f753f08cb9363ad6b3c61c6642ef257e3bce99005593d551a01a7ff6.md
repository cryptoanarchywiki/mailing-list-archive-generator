I only have time to keep up with my mailing lists on the weekend, so these
may have been mentioned, but...

Didn't Netscape get the short end of a major banking alliance recently?
And wasn't Microsoft's network and security software favored by that?

Has anyone here messed about with PDAs/PICs?  The Apple Newton doesn't have
much in the way of communication, but MagicCap based boxes such as Sony's
Magic Link have an awful lot of (as yet unrealized) potential.  I see as much
promise/threat for communications security in the newer PDA/PIC devices as
in Netscape.

But then i also want Netscape to invoke Eudora for mail and Newswatcher for
news, rather than having to use the as yet unstable Netscape tools.
