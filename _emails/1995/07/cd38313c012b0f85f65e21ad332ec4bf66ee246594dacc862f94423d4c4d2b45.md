Source code for them is available for $25,000, but only binaries are
available otherwise.  The source code for RC4 was leaked or
reverse-engineered, so it is widely known now, but RSA has never released
the algorithm officially.  I have found no documentation on the algorithm
behind RC2.  They are in fact secret, proprietary algorithms, with the
exception of the unofficial RC4 code.
