-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

 

I am searching for a time-stamping service that will sign some data of mine
(or a hash thereof) along with a certificate indicating what time(,date,year)
the signing occurred.  I want to use this to substantiate my claim that I
was in possession of this data before others were.  (Useful for copyrights/
patents, and possibly other things.)


(Of course, I could just encrypt the data, PGP-authentify it with my
private key, and post it to UseNet, but this strikes me as inefficient and
impolite.)


If anyone knows where I can find such a service please post here or 
e-mail me.  Thanks.
