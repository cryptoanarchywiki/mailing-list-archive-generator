Perry's right.

With a fairly current BIND (named), MIT stores on the order of 100-200
bytes of data per Athena user for ~25000 users.  MIT's been doing this
for years; for the longest time, they were using ~1 MIPS Vaxstation
II's with ~9MB of memory as DNS servers.  

1024 bit RSA public keys are ~128 bytes, as are digital signatures.
If we allow framing and similar stuff to expand the size of the data
to 150 bytes per key/signature, and if each user had a signed key in
the DNS, this would roughly triple the amount of data in the DNS.

This Is Not A Problem.

I haven't looked at the CPU load needed to compute the signatures, but
that takes place off-line, not on-line.
