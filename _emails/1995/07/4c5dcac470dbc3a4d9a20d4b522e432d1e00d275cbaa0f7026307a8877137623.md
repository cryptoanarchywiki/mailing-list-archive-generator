Synchronicity! [argh] I had been considering making a posting along
the same lines. Note that the form required [EXT 1042(09/93)] has a
$15 processing fee. (Which might be peanuts if we're selling a
frigate, but which is a royal pain for a piece of crypto.)

Page 1, "A guide to Canada's Export Controls", April 1994

General "Software" Note
This list does not embargo "software" which is either:
1.	Generally available to the public by being:
	a.	Sold from stock at retail selling points, without
		restriction, by means of:
		1.	Over-the-counter transactions;
		2.	Mail order transactions; or
		3.	Telephone call transactions; and
	b.	Designed for installation by the user without further
		substantial support by the supplier; or
2.	"In the public domain".



<sigh>

Excerpts relating to Canadian Export controls on cryptography should
be up somewhere off http://www.io.org/~samwise/interesting.html#privacy
towards the end of the week.
