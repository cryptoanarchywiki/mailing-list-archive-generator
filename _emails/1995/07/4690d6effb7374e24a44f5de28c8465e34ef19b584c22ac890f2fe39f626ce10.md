I just looked @ the front of a M.O. computer catalog & the numerals in the
prices are anything but random. A very heavy concentration of eights (8) &
nines (9), apparently this company is more into $508.98 (color inkjet printer)
& $38.98 (well known game s/w) than the old late night TV standby of
"JUST $19.99!". Of course, this is because of excessively documented
ad nauseum human psychological tendencies that salescritters, who set at
least the lsd's of price, have been aware of for millenia. I'd bet, that
5(five), 8(eight), & 9(nine) are significantly more represented across
the board in prices (& thus in amounts for checks & tax write offs) than
than their random distribution by Benford's Law or more well known tests
for randomness would suggest. Has Mr. Negrini factored this into his program?
I guess the lesson is do a few pgp make__random's & convert a few of the
hex numbers to dec digits for the lsd's the next time one does creative expense
reporting.
