    In practice, I'd probably buy Viacrypt for legal reasons but use
    PGP anyway.

I'd be interesting in hearing some of the lawyers out there comment on
this.  While I know that I can test interoperability, I prefer using
something that I compiled myself which I think is not an option with
Viacrypt.  This is not to say that I could swear that I understand all
of the code that I compiled for the free versions of PGP, but (a) I
have spent considerable time looking at the parts that were most
interesting to me -- even translating some things to other programming
languages and (b) I know that others have also examined the code and
nobody has come up with anything terribly damning.
