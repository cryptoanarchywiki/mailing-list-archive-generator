I can think of one good reason for starters:  Microsoft makes Excel.  
Microsoft makes Windoze.  Windoze runs on IBM's and Linux runs X-Windows on 
IBM's.  Microsoft doesn't make Linux which already has a tremendous 
advantage in cost and capability.  Now how many people would pay to upgrade 
to Windoze 95 if there were a true multitasking OS which was free and more 
efficient and capable of operating on more limited systems and with as 
strong a software base?  If I could get Microsoft Office for Linux, I would 
have switched myself.  Unfortuantely, I don't have the disk space for both 
DOS and Linux, and I need the commercial grade word-processors, etc...  
There isn't all that much that needs to be added to an OS like Linux to make 
it easy for the general public (perhaps a set of default settings that don't 
require much fiddling by a unix wizard).  Finally, once Microsoft promotes a 
unix-based OS by making software for it, people will start realizing how 
much free stuff there already is for unix, and they will stop buying all 
those nifty utility packages that they buy for DOS/Windoze.  And lastly, 
heaven forbid, people will have access to a windowed OS with command line 
capability!  Now we couldn't have that now, could we?  :)
