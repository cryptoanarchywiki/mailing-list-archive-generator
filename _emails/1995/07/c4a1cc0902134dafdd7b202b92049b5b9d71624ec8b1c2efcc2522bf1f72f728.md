I can only quote the original posting to the SOCKS mailing list - I answered 
their call for beta-testers, but I haven't heard back from them, yet:

Subject: Good news for Windows/Winsock users

New SOCKS application for PC/Windows/Winsock.  Looking for beta
volunteers...

We've developed an MSWindows .DLL (Windows version 3.1) that allows
unmodified TCP-based Winsock applications and TCP/IP stacks to
communicate through a SOCKS4.2 server.  This will hopefully be
available for general release sometime soon.  Currently, I'm looking
for volunteers to do some beta testing.

If interested, willing to provide feedback, and don't mind rebooting
your PC when when it locks up :-), email the following information
about your environment to scbeta-apply@syl.dl.nec.com:

1. Winsock stack type and version (Trumpet, NetManage, etc.).
2. Other network OS/drivers (Netware, IPX, packet drivers, SLIP, etc.).
3. Winsock applications (trumptel, wsftp, netscape, etc.).
4. Your email address.
5. Anything else relevant...

I'll keep the number of beta testers limited and so unfortunately I
might not be able to include everyone who requests.

Oh, BTW, here are some requirements:
1. MS Windows3.1.
2. Installed and operating Winsock TCP/IP stack.
3. Installed and operating SOCKS server (v.4.2).
4. PC running Winsock stack must be able to use DNS to resolve
   names and IP addresses (including its own).

I'm afraid we'll have to live with async socket calls for a while...

Well, a config file would be necessary for the windows one too. For 
example, we could want to socksify only connections to some sites/ports, 
socksify+encrypt some others, and open direct TCP connections to others 
yet, such as servers on the same net (I presume that NEC's DLL will 
attempt to socksify all the connections, so we should de-sockisfy some of 
them intoducing sockd functionality.

Oh yes, I actually meant that it should only be able to issue, and not also
accept, "client hello" requests (as per SSL model).

RSA patents (I mean RSA, not RSADSI's) are only valid in USA. If I set up 
a certifying authority, say, here in Hong Kong, using EAY's code written in 
Australia, how could RSADSI complain? Server operators would import 
data created under perfectly legal conditions.

That should be investigated. Is RSAREF's licence only valid for some 
entry points? In any case, I suppose that SSLREF may be used with any 
certificate, unlike Netscape (am I wrong?).

Well, the same problem exists for illegal uses of the present remailers, 
but hasn't stopped their operators.
