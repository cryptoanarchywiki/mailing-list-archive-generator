Well, it would be just as easy (although, admittedly, somewhat less
convenient to the users) to have the web page such that the users could
type in the letter, with some ``suggested text'' (perhaps randomly 
generated as above), perhaps even as the default; then it's just a matter
of editing a few sentances, and maybe adding a paragraph or two...  then
click, and it's off.

It wouldn't be as convenient as just-click-and-a-letter-will-be-sent,
but it's still more convenient than having to write the letter yourself,
which means that it'll generate more traffic...
