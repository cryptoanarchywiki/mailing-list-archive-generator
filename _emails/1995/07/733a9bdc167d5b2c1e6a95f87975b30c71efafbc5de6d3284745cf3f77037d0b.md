Heh, heh.

Infobahn also has an article by Sandy Sandfort in it; Sandy had it at
the SF Cpunks meeting, so I assumed I'd be able to find it at the store
(haven't yet; the first issue was 40K copies for nationwide distribution.)

Michael Berch, the publisher, is a reasonable guy, if you like his type.
mcb@postmodern.com (infobahn.com was taken).  He's got some lawyer background
and hacked computers at LLNL for a while.
