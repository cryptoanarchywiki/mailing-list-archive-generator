It seems likely to me that an actual GAK system will require some fee per key.

For example, one might have to send in a form, maybe a diskette, and a $25
per key fee for "handling costs."

This is the way automobile registrations are handled (and they have become
a "revenue source"..I pay $450 per year to register my truck!!!).

This makes trying to register 2^128 keys rather expensive.
