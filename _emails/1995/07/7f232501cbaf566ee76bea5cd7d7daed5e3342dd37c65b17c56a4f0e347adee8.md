   Given all the prior art, I have a solid suspicion that the patent
   wouldn't hold up. The existance of the publically published Diffie
   Hellman patent, for instance, makes it rather hard to patent the
   more general case.

Does anyone know if that patent on distributed file systems that was
filed in '82 and granted sometime recently held up in court?

The last I heard the guy was going around collecting royalty payments
from large companies unwilling to go to court anyway.

Is this the sort of thing it's easier for a small company to challenge
than a big company?
