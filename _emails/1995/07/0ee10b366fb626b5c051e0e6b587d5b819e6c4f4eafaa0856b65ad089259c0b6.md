You mean you don't?!!!
But seriously, I get it directly from MIT, check the checksums, etc.  I'm
pretty sure that it hasn't been tampered with.  And, actually, I've read
a good deal of the source code...especially the rsaref library.  Not cause
I'm paranoid, just interested.
If I get the source code from, say, my friend, who I trust, who got it from 
someone he trusted, and so on down the line, the line of trust falls into
question.  Who's to say someone doesn't like someone on that line, and
modifies the code...don't you have "friends" you don't like? :)
