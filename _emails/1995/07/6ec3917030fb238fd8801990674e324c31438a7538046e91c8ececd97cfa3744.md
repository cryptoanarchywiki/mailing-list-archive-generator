> DEVIANCE -- COMPARED TO WHAT?
> Peter Huber, author of "Orwell's Revenge" and senior fellow at the Manhattan
> Institute, points out that "community standards" are no longer definable in
> cyberspace.  "`Deviance' loses its meaning, when communities of the
> like-minded are formed entirely by consent.  Freedom of association is so
> complete in cyberspace that traditional limits on freedom of speech become
> almost impossible to justify constitutionally."  (Forbes 7/31/95 p.110)
