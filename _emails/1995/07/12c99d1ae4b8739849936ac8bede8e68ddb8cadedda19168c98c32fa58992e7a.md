Here are just two of the topics which will be discussed:

Bruce Schneier,  Author of "Applied Cryptography".  TOPIC:  Will speak on
issues surrounding cryptography, digital authentication, digital cash.

EFF.  TOPIC:  Will cover current legal threats, privacy and computer
information networks.

I believe last year's key speak was Mr. Phil Zimmerman.  There are currently
22 speakers registered for this year's convention.

:)  See ya in Vegas.
