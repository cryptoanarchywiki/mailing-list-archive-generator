I see little reason for such confidence.

Thats far from true as well. The Java interpreter could have all its
I/O abilities removed, for example, rather than relying on correct
implementation of the possibly correct language model to keep users
from performing I/O. -- I can name lots of similar things.

Having designed systems to be as secure as possible, I'd say that Java
violates lots of the constraints. Its too big, too complicated, and
relies for its security on the correctness of its implementation.

Again, this depends on the correctness of the implementation.
