Well, I know there are already products like this out there, because the
company I work for uses one.

I was helping my boss/project lead figure out why he couldn't establish an
account on the penet anonymous server, and in the process of phone calls to
various people, we discovered that the anonymous server at penet is blocked
from our site, and also that every web connection is logged.

Actually, I have no problem with this, even if they restrict usenet feed to
the comp heirarchy, restrict web activity to a list of approved sites, log
all they want to, etc.  That's why I got a seperate account.
