> Where does the effort to bruteforce SSL stand?

Andy has the spec wrapped up, and is finalising his Windows 32 Client.
I have the key doler running, a perl client and a shell driving script,
	along with a new WWW interface (which we hope won't be used much)
Adam has bruterc4 tweaked to interact with my perl client.
Andrew has a copy of bruterc4 and is making brutessl similar.

We're all ready to go, but I'm off for three weeks, and as Adam will be taking
over my stuff in my absence, it might take him a while to understand it and
make the few last minute tweaks ....
