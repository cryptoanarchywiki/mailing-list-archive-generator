|   The problem/gripe is that whenever I try to manipulate public keys on
| my keyring, PGP grabs the first one with User ID "Bryce".  How do I extract,
| edit, sign, etc. the *other* "Bryce" keys on my public keyring.  I tried
| giving PGP the Key ID, which seemed like the most reasonable user interface
| to me, but that didn't work.

	You often need to use 0xKEYID.  I name my keys with expiration
dates in them, so I can simply type 95 or 96 to id a key pretty
uniquely.

Also, the MyName option in config.txt is worth looking at.

| Third, how do I set those "PGP-Note" strings that appear in some people's
| PGP Signature Blocks?

pgp -sa +comment="Boycott Clipper!"
or comment in your config.txt


	With regards to docs, I tend to point people at Simson
Garfinkel's pgp book.  Most people find reading a book better than
reading online docs, and Simson does a fairly good job of explaining
everything.
