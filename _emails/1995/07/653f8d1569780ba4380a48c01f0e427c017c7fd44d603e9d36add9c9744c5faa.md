	It's more from the graphical interface than anything else, or has 
been. My Mac is a 25 MHz 040...not that fast these days, but pretty good. 
I simply miss being able to tab through my news.

	Unfortunately, with telnet(and yes, I do use this extensively), 
one is hobbled by the fact that the tin program resides on the other side 
of the link. In most cases, the link itself, and the machine it connects 
to, are insecure. This means that one cannot easily use PGP to auto-sign 
messages without keeping the key and a copy of PGP on the remote server.

One can, of course, pre-compose the message, sign/encrypt it, and then 
upload it, but that is a great deal of work compared to simply using TinSign.
It also works against the spontaneous nature of news(for me, at least). 
When was the last time you went to a newsgroup knowing everything you 
would say in advance?

	I'm in the sixth week of my first programming class...as if that 
means anything. :-) I see your point, 'cypherpunks write code' and all. 
Simply wishing that I could run tin (relatively) securely on my Mac w/out 
needing to install FreeBSD or Linux(which I want to do, anyway).
