   Just to clarify, you mentioned "useful at the home level." I can't speak
   for Ray, but I certainly didn't mean HotJava (or PowerObjects, or OpenDoc,
   or Agents tools, etc.) would be used at "the home level."

   Such tools would likely be used at the programming level.

The tools you mention are either interpreted or gain their
functionality when used at the "home" level.

OLE (gag me with a forklift!) seems to be used more by users to
integrate their own environments together because the programmers
forgot to.

Just speaking as a humble and frustrated Windows 3.1 user.
