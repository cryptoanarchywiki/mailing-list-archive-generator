Very good example ... I think you will find that many programs are 
physcially coded on a unix box and crossed compiled using something
like gcc or g++. One of the last steps is add the gui interface if 
required, compile on the native target platform using the compiler of
choice for that target. 

I have a friend who is coding an OS/2 project and using AIX as the 
development platform. The project started by downloading some source
code for a unix platform that essentially performed the desired task
studying it and modeling their code  after the source code off the net.
Why reinvent the wheel ?

Very true of games and that is one of the reasons DOS is a popular
platform for games ... direct hardware control is possible and the
hardware architecture is only INTEL x86 ... although the technology 
is evolving beyond this point rapidly. Another reason for the large 
game market with DOS machines is simply the huge home market where 
DOS is the undisputed leader.
