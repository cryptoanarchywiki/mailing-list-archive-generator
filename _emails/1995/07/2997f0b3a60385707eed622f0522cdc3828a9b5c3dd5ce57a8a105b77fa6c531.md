True, but an important part of the promise of Java is that many people are
AFAIK actively working on porting it to most major platforms. Right now it
apparently runs only on Solaris 2.3+ and Win NT 3.5. However, Sun is working
on porting it to Win `95 and Mac System 7.5. I assume other people are
trying to port it to other Unices. I recognize that this is RSN again, but
I believe there is reason for optimism in this case.

I'm getting extremely interested in porting the Mixmaster client to Java.
Doug Barnes' enthusiasm at the last BA phys. mtg. has proven infectious,
with a delayed reaction in my case ;).  I plan to say more about this
notion on mix-l within the next few days.
