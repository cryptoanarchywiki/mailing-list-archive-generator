I think there's a definite need here. If some obliging soul can "blow the
whistle" by posting to the net 1) Surfwatch's list of banned sites, and/or
2) the criteria Surfwatch uses when determining what sites to block, it
would certainly be beneficial. At the very least, it would allow everyone
to see what sort of information they believe is "harmful to minors".
