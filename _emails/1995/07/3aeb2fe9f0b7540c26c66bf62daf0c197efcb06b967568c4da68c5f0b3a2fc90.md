The owner of the key being cracked jumps in and "randomly" selects the part 
of the keyspace containing the key, then reports back in the negative.

This defense of the key is reduced if the server doles out pieces of the 
keyspace randomly, selected only for size, and further reduced if the same 
space is given out multiple times to different requestors.
