There doesn't seem to be any suggestion that an employer will attempt to control net access that you pay and use yourself with your own equipment. What's the problem? As far as net access from work, that will naturally sort itself out. If unfettered access is beneficial to an enterprise then that will become apparent as "repressive" companies prove incapable of competing with "permissive" companies.
