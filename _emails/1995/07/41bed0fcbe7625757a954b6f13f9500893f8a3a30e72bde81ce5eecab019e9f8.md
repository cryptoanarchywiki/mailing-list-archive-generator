Hmm.. I'm not sure I'd want to stand too close when one of those
things goes off, but it would be an interesting demo. :)

Maybe behind an EM shield.. ;) 
I think there was a question of some microelectronics being permenently
damaged because of fusion at the MOS level (burning through the gate), so
it might have to be a disposable machine in a place where no other machines
are near. It would depend on the magnitude of the charge (and hence cost
of the weapon). It might take a very expensive one to do this, or maybe
not...
