That's just about right.

Right now I am thinking of e$ as a "collectors item" or a fun thing to
brag about in some distant year.  I'm offering US$1.00 for e$15.00, but
I will quit offering that price once I run out of US$ or decide that I
have enough e$!


I think that the ecm market is probably composed of very few people who
mostly want to buy, and is therefore not a high-volume market!  If the ecm
market got a link from the DigiCash home page (which I'm sure it could do)
then you would probably get lots of people who just got their free e$100.00
and who are willing to sell part of it after having experienced the wonders
of the slot machines and the "e$0.01-per-move tic-tac-toe" games.
  Could we set up a WWW version of the ecm market, listing latest offers
to anyone with a WWW browser?  Things might really pick up-- at least for
us buyers!


I'm also considering other strategies for gaining e$--  offering a service
on the DigiCash "cybershops" page, or just going to all my e-mail using
friends, showing them how to get their free e$100.00, and then begging them
to give me half of it.  (Finder's fee?  Friendly gift?)


Possibly I shouldn't have posted the above and given my e$-collecting
competitors the idea, because eventually DigiCash is going to quit giving
out freebies!  Hopefully my friends will get on the ball and acquire their
freebies before that point!  :-)   [mental note to add some of said friends
to the Cc: line...]


Bryce
P.S.  Oh great.  My "friends" are asking for the $1.00 for e$15.00 deal...
