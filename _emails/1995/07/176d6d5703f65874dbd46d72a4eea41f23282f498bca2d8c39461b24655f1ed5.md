Depends on the load on the host, the speed of your link, the speed of your
Mac, and if you want to trade features for speed at that given moment.

The human interface is the whole point behind Newswatcher and Nuntius. As
for Mac users that prefer tin, they already have an implementation
available. It is called telnet.

I have been thinking about writing AppleScripts that link Newswatcher with
PGP. Unfortunately, there is another project that has precedence. Still, as
with most great utility software not yet available, you can always try to
write it yourself.

Have fun,
