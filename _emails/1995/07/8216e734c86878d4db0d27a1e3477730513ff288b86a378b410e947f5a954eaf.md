I called up Exon's press secretary and asked him about this. He 
claimed that BBS's were uploading advertisments to the Net, and this
was the 'profiteering' referred to. He was immune to reason on this,
and felt that the CMU 'study' was rigorous.

It's true that a some of the pics in those groups include stamped-in
BBS names and phone numbers, but my impression was always that this
was the BBS operators trying to do a little damage control - so that
when random users post their pix (on which they claim copyright, 
ignoring the fact that most of their scans rip off magazine 
publishers), they can recognize the 'piracy', and also earn a little
publicity.
