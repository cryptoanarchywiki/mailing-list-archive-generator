I think someone mentioned the possibility of running a Mixmaster
client in Java.

I was under the impression that there was a lot of common code
between the Mixmaster client and server versions, at least in
the current version.

Does it have to be the case, then, that we even have separate client
and server versions? If a new program is going to be written in Java,
can't it have the functionality of both client and server?

Why not "charge" for the ability to send an anonymous message with
the duty to have for a short time (maybe an hour or two) running on
your machine a node in a remailer network?
