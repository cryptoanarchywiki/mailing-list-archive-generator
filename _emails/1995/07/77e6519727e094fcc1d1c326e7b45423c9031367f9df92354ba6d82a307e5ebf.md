     Sounds like an untapped market segment.  In which periodicals
     should one advertise consulting services in order to cover the
     mobster market?

     Seriously, I imagine that organized crime, like any other
     business, uses computers.  Their level of crypto usage could be
     impressive, given the incentives.

     "There is no honor among thieves."  Wiretaps, bugs, tails,
     informants, and good, old-fashioned, physical intimidation
     probably produce plenty of leads.

     I wasn't entirely facetious above about working for the mob,
     they probably pay well and don't bother with FICA and such.  Plus
     there's that "family" atmosphere....
