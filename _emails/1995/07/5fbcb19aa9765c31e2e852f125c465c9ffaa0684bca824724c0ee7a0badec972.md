Keeping H(password) on the server and logging in with H(blob,H(password)) is
no different than keeping the password on the server and logging in with
H(blob,password).  Anyone who can read the password file on the server can
authenticate himself.

To protect against packet sniffers monitoring your login stream _and_
system crackers looking at the password file, you need some form of PKC.

Free-after-1997 example:
        g is a generator of a prime p.

        password is X (0<X<p);

        password file has g^X mod p.

        login server generates Y, issues challenge g^Y.
        expected response is g^XY mod p

        login client has X, generates (g^Y)^X = g^XY mod p.

        J. Random SuperHacker can get g^X, and g^Y, but not g^XY.

Free-after-2000 example.
        Server Has RSA Public Key
        Client has Private Key.

        Server generates challenge.

        Client signs [Hash of] challenge.
