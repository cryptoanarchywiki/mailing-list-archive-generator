Mr. Borenstein's text production rate is truly amazing.  We should
induct him into the Internet Hall-of-Fame immediately.

He rivals Kibo in his ability to detect messages about himself or his
company.  He rivals Sternlight in his ability to generate endless
streams of minor points.

Crypto-relevance: 

1) What technique could be used to differentiate Boorenstein's rants
from automatic rant generator output?  Has First Virtual done this?
If someone wanted to generate a Borenstein rant-generator, god knows
that there's enough low-entropy sample material out there.

2) If you're looking for keywords to insert into your M-x
spook-the-spooks generator, try Borenstein and First Virtual.
