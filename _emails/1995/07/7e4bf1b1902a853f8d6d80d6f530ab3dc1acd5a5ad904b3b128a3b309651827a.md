Sorry I misunderstood you, professor. I had always heard those "computer
codes" you mention referred to as "computer languages," and I thought
of "code" as refering to use of cryptography software like Nautilus or 
(of course) PGP. A quick skim of your interesting article reveals that 
this "code" vs. "language" terminology nitpicking is no-doubt as important
to you as it is to me, as we both know that's where legal and political
debates are won and lost. I freely admit my "excess of libertarian 
paranoia," [though I prefer to term my feelings "healthy respect for
world history"]. 

NOTE: I have always been computer-and-math-impaired compared to others
who have been on this list much longer, so I'm *certainly* no final 
authority as to what stuff should be called.

A later post indicates the professor's interesting article is at:

Or alternating current [thank you, Mr. Tesla]. The founders anticipated
inventions such as both of these in Article 1, Section 8.

I'd certainly flunk *any* C-punk test, unless it involves just 
writing IN code by using PGP for both encryption and authentication,
or the warm feeling I get in my heart for Phil Zimmermann.

Agreed. As my earlier post (sadly) admitted, the 9th is *NOT* in vogue
these days. I also said that since the 9th is so universally ignored,
it just clutters-up the rest of the Bill of Rights and [perhaps] it 
therefore should be repealed. The people who say, "The 9th Amendment 
means nothing," or "it has no teeth," seem to be the same folks most 
reluctant to even *discuss* repeal, perhaps because discussion would 
inevitably bring publicity to those of us who support a 9th Amendment
*with* _plenty_ of teeth. 

For _much_ better "forgotten 9th" scholarship than my random thoughts
on this list, I suggest the kind and cooperative "market liberal" folks
at the suddenly-influential CATO Institute, located at URL:
