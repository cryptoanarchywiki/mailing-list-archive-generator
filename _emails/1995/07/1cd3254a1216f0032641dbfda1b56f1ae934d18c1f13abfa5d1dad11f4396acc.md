Well, X.509 for now. The Eastlake-Kaufman DNS Security work
(draft-ietf-dnssec-secext-04.txt) plus MOSS (draft-ietf-pem-mime-08.txt
--now proposed standard, awaiting an RFC number) promise to give us
a non-X.509 certification structure for the Internet. S-HTTP explicitly
looks to this work to free us from X.500. 

Note that this only marginally improves the situation, however,
since what you really want is commercial-grade certification,
and you still can't issue RSA certificates, whatever the
format, without licensing from RSADSI. This promises to be
something of an issue in the future.
