   "The Spies' Code and How It Broke. The Russians had a
   problem: it's almost impossible to be perfectly random.

      The Russians suffered from a lapse in quality control.
      They inadvertently let some pattern find its way into
      their scrambled codes, a loose thread that allowed
      American code breakers to unravel the scheme. "Given a
      pure, perfect one-time system, you're not going to break
      it," said David Kahn, visiting historian at the N.S.A.'s
      Center for Cryptologic History.                RAN_dum


   "Twilight of the Nukes. The post-war years were spent
   hoarding nuclear weapons. Now it's time to put them away."

      Since that first nuclear test the United States has
      built 70,000 nuclear weapons of almost every conceivable
      kind: warheads, artillery shells, land mines, depth
      charges and even backpack-style plutonium explosives
      weighing 58 pounds but equivalent to 10 tons of TNT. But
      now it is the twilight of the nukes. They are being
      taken apart by the United States and the Soviet Union at
      the rate of 10 or 12 a day, and the new problem is how
      to keep track them of all.                     TWI_god
