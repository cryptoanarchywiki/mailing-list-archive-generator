O.K., this is totally off any reasonable topic, but allow me the indulgence:

I've been hanging around Carl Weiman's lab for a couple of years (a friend
of mine works on one of the projects), and this is one hell of an 
achievement. The apparatus they use sits on a tabletop, and you can
watch the gas through infared T.V. cameras in real time. The trap is just
a little vacuum chamber with windows in the side. They use the same
diode lasers that come in your C.D. player, an ingeniously inexpensive
setup. 

Yow!
