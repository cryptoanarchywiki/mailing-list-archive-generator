RICO does not require that either the enterprise or the predicate acts
were motivated by (hope of) economic gain. _National Organization for Women
v. Scheidler_, 114 S.Ct. 798, 127 L.Ed.2d 99 (1994) or
ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/92-780.ZO.filt

Looks like Bob Dornan wants to change that, though (probably because RICO
was used to sue anti-abortion terrorists). He introduced HR 230 which
would amend 18 USC 1961(5) to require "profit-seeking purpose" to establish
a RICO "enterprise". THOMAS says that HR 230 is in the House Judiciary
Committee. 

RICO is at http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/uscode/18/ch96.html et seq :) 
for the curious.
