On another subject entirely...

I have naturally been concerned about the Feds' proposal to set up
a national job licensing system.  In order to protect us from
hordes of illegals, they have suggested that employers be required
to check SS#-True Name matches before employment could begin.

This amounts to requiring federal permission for the 55 million 
annual job changes.  Initially, it is supposed to be restricted to
checking SS# validity, name match, and non multiple use.  Later (as with
driver's licenses) they will add restrictions having to do with tax
compliance, child support compliance, library fine compliance, etc.
After all, we wouldn't want tax evading, deadbeat dad, library
scofflaws working in Amerika, would we?

This suggests am interesting Denial of Service (DOS) attack.  If
you published your own or others' SS#-True Name pairs on a public
forum (currently completely legal BTW), multiple use could be 
encouraged, the TrueNames would become unemployable, and interesting
litigation would result.  If done enough, systemic breakdown would
occur.

I am anxious to see the regs (they are just at the talking stage) to
see how they handle "exceptions" like thus.
