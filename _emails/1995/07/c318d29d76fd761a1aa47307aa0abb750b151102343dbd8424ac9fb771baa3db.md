       Why not offer an anonymous proxy of some kind for e-cash? You can
charge per connect or per unit of time, simply to demonstrate the concept. The
techniques developed for remailers(breaking up messages...accepting PGP-
encrypted destinations...varying times...so on) could find an application
here. If a chain could be constructed, it would help protect the identity of
the user(assuming no collusion between operators). 

The problem is, as always, to write the code. Not to mention the
ethical/possibly legal question of selling anonymity...

Another possible service: selling gems of wisdom in pieces.

Find or write a gem of wisdom...taking into account copyright laws and so
forth.
Then set up a storefront via telnet or http...a sort of kiosk. Customers can
then buy secrets or portions of secrets...or percentages. Use a secret
splitting algorithm to allow people to 'split the cost' of a secret and then
get in touch with each other through anonymous remailers set up for that
purpose by your kiosk.
        Depending on the information you're selling(whether it be the secret
key for BlackNet or simply the contents of your CD collection), you could earn
some e-cash this way. An all-or-nothing-disclosure-of-secrets protocol might
also come in handy.
        Again, the problem is sitting down and writing the code. Has anyone
made any significant efforts toward either of these yet, with or without CD$?
