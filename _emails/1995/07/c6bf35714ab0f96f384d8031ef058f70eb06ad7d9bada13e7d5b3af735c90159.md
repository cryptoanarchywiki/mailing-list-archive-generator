Agreed, certainly.

I certainly would never say the success of Unix is due to snobbishness,
though personal taste does play a role. And, historically, the
academic/pedantic aspects of Unix played a role in its adoption.

(Most important, I think, was that the proliferation of minicomputer and
mainframe operating systems was controlled by Unix killing off all the
proprietary, vendor-specific OSs.)

Sure. Same here. All I was addressing was the claim that no vanguard apps
ever appear on PCs, that Unix is where it all happens.

I certainly have not claimed that. In fact, I'll be the first to concede
that Mac users are more ivory tower types, in the sense of being fanatics
and advocates for their platform. (Though there are some Unix bigots out
there, notably now on Linux....I don't see Linux making any strides in the
workstation (SGI, Sun) market, just on the cheap Intel-based boxes
people--mostly non-corporate, it seems to me--are buying.)
