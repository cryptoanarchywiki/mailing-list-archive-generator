Paul Elliott asked about the subcommittee referral of S.974 in the Senate
Judiciary Committee. Although I've never done more in Arizona than loiter in
the Phoenix airport, a staffer in Sen. Kyl's office kindly responded to my
request for information about Judiciary subcmtes. and action on S.974 (on a
Sunday, no less !)

Charles Grassley (R-IA) is the primary sponsor of S.974, and Jon Kyl (R-AZ)
is the cosponsor. 

Sen. Grassley chairs the Subcmte. on Administrative Oversight & the Courts, 
(202) 224-6736. Sen. Leahy (D-VT), who's sponsoring an alternative to the
CDT, also sits on this subcommittee.

Sen. Kyl sits on the Subcmte. on the Constitution, Federalism & Property 
Rights, (202) 224-8081. Sen. Feingold (D-CO), who has spoken out against
the CDT, is also a member of this subcommittee.

Both Grassley & Kyl are on the Immigration Subcmte., (202) 224-6098, but it's
hard to see why the bill would get referred there.

The Subcmte. on Terrorism, Technology & Government Information, 
(202) 224-6791, might take an interest in S.974, but neither Grassley nor
Kyl sits on it. Leahy belongs to this subcmte.

There's no sign in the Congressional Quarterly synopsis of any subcommittee
referral of S.974 thus far:
