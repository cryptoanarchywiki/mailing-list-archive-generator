Foreign representative offices have very limited powers under US
banking law.  In addition, they have to be as forthcoming with
US authorities as do US banks.  There is no greater privacy with
them than with US banks doing the same sorts of transfers.  They
do make it a little easier to open Swiss or other offshore bank
accounts because they can handle the identity verification stuff
here, so you don't have to go there.
