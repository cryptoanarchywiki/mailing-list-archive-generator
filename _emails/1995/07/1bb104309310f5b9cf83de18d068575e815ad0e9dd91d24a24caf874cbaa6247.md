Note that I didn't post that to the list.

Your requoting it, without the intermediate quoting of the person who _did_
post it to the list, makes it appear I was spewing this garbage to the

I don't care for your pop psychology. I would've followed your advice and
left these comments in e-mail only, had you done the same.
