I think you're drawing a misleading analogy.  When I present e-cash to
the institution the underwrites the conversion from e-cash to "real
money", they have to decide if it's real or not.  If the e-cash is
anonymous, they are the *only* people on the line -- anonymous e-cash
doesn't carry history or say "this money is coming out of so-and-so's
account".  It is anonymous e-cash being converted to real money, and the
converting bank carries essentially all of the risk.

As far as the guarantees offered by digital signatures are concerned,
the whole point of my comments was to analyze the risks involved when
secret keys are compromised.  In this case, by definition, the digital
signatures are not very useful any more.
