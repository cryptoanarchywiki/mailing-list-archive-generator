   Science, Dec 1, 1995.

   "The Evolution of Molecular Computation." By Willem
   Stemmer. Comments on the limitations of Leonard Adleman's
   and Richard Lipton's DNA-computation research compared to
   the utility of sequence evolution computation.

      Although DNA sequencing of the selected solutions poses
      a practical problem for molecular computation, this
      drawback does not exist for computation with genetic
      algorithms or for in vitro evolution or computer
      simulations of natural evolution, called artificial
      life. Sequence evolution appears to be a useful general
      tool for solving many complex problems, whether the
      solution is a number, sequence, program, or structure.
