Forward:

Steven E. Miller, a member of the national board of
directors of Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility, has published a new book, *Civilizing
Cyberspace: Policy, Power and the Information
Superhighway* (Addison Wesley, 1995, 413 pages).

This is the best book I have seen on the public policy
debates surrounding the information superhighway. It
covers all aspects of this debate, including democracy,
citizenship, community networks, privacy, intellectual
property, competing models of the NII, universal service,
equity, freedom of expression, protecting the public
interest, encryption, and so on.

Highly recommended for anyone interested in this subject,
or for use as a text in classes.
