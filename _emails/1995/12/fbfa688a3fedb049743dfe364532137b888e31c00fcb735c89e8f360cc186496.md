| While we're here..  I havn't been able to find anyone on the planet who's

| tricky.  If anyone can point me at it I'd apreciate it. Hell, if someone 
| can definitively say they've /seen/ such a thing it'd be nice. So far 
| i've found one person who insists that his system admins sisters 
| boyfriends cousin from Saint Petersburg has been using un-rm for unix for 
| years. *sigh* 


	From comp.unix.questions FAQ:

	MIT's Project Athena has produced a comprehensive
      delete/undelete/expunge/purge package, which can serve as a
      complete replacement for rm which allows file recovery.  This
      package was posted to comp.sources.misc (volume 17, issue
      023-026)
