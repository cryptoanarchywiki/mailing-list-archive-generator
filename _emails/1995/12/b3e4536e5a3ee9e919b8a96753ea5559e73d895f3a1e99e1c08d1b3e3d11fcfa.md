A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories. This draft is a work item of the Common Authentication 
Technology Working Group of the IETF.                                      

       Title     : Independent Data Unit Protection Generic Security 
                   Service Application Program Interface  (IDUP-GSS-API)   
       Author(s) : C. Adams
       Filename  : draft-ietf-cat-idup-gss-03.txt
       Pages     : 35
       Date      : 12/14/1995

The IDUP-GSS-API extends the GSS-API [RFC-1508] for applications requiring 
protection of a generic data unit (such as a file or message) in a way 
which is independent of the protection of any other data unit and 
independent of any concurrent contact with designated "receivers" of the 
data unit.  Thus, it is suitable for applications such as secure electronic
mail where data needs to be protected without any on-line connection with 
the intended recipient(s) of that data.  Subsequent to being protected, the
data unit can be transferred to the recipient(s) - or to an archive - 
perhaps to be processed ("unprotected") only days or years later.          

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address.  After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
     "get draft-ietf-cat-idup-gss-03.txt".

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.	
	                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-cat-idup-gss-03.txt".
							
NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.
							
For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@cnri.reston.va.us.
