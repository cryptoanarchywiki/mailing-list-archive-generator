You're looking too deeply. My point was in response to the very common
error people make in talking about "factoring a large prime number." A
prime is actually easy to factor: itself and 1, which is the point I was
making.

(One can quibble about whether 1 is a factor...I include it, though 1 is
admittedly not considered a prime. But this is a quibble, I think.)
