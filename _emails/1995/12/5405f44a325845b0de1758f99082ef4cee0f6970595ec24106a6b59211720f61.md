And later.

The term 'pressing a defendant for a plea' came from the practice of 
piling heavy weights on a defendant and 'pressing' him into the very 
floor of the court. (As defendants who did not admit a plea would save 
their family from being held accountable to judgment, the incentive to 
remain silent was high).  Often weight was piled atop the hapless 
defendant until he or she expired, having refused to enter a plea.
