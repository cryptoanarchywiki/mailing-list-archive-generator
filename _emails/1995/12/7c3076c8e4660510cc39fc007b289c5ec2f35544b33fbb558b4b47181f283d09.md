C'punks,

So far, no one has come up with anything stronger than specula-
tion about my database question.  Some "anonymous" told me how

didn't give the guy my phone number.

Fine, but I haven't put in any changes of address with the PO.

Yeah, maybe, but my original question was, "does anyone KNOW how 
the trick was done?                                     ^^^^


 S a n d y

P.S.  I'm not looking for movie makers, but for movie
      investors.  Jeez
