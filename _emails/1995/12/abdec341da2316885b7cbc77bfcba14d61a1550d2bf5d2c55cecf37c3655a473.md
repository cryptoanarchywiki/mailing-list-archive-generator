Go and sue, Fred. Its what I have lawyers for. If you can even find an
attorney willing to take your "case", mine will likely remind yours
that lawyers can now be punished by the court in many jurisdictions
for knowingly aiding in bringing frivolous suits. If you are seeking
$1 in damages the court is especially likely to consider the whole
thing a waste of time.

I think you will find that I'm very, very hard to intimidate. Don't
bother "giving me a second chance" or any such stuff. Either find a
lawyer stupid enough to risk his license by taking this case and let
me know you are suing me by sending over a process server, or quit
bothering me.

I think you will find that John Gilmore is even more difficult to
intimidate than I am.
