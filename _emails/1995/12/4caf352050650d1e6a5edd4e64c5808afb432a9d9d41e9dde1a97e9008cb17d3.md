I'm not having much luck on this example, am I? The RSA-129 I remembered
correctly as being 129 decimal digits, but I spaced out on the 384-bit key
and mislabelled it as "RSA-384."

It'll be _many_ years before a 384-decimal-digit number is factored, I
suspect. Let alone a 600-digit modulus, with or without the mysterious
"transphaser" technology mentioned by Anitro.
