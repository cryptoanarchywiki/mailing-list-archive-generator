More to the point, us poor professional staff don't stand a chance 
politically against students and faculty. We support whatever they want 
to use.

I think it's more an issue of control. Ford IS can say Thou Shalt Not
turn on SAP advertisement, and people will listen (or go away). At major
Universities, what we do with troublemakers is, we hire them.

But back to the point, the anonymous (cypherpunk relevance) "system 
administrator" (guess they couldn't find anyone willing to make a fool 
of himself on the record?) who said that Universities would be hurt more 
was wrong. We just don't have passwords on Win95 machines, or don't care 
if they're compromised. It's the people at Ford, Dow, and Sprint, 
which had wasted man-years putting together "policies" and "user 
profiles" that have proven to be worse than useless, who are pissed off.

Actually, yes. Low $40's (consider CA cost of living), direct user
support, but high level of freedom. You're probably overqualified,
though.
