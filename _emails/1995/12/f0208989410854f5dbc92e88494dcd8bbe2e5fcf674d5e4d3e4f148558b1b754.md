I've had a little chat with the web people downstairs about this.  I 
don't know what they were thinking when they have this guy permission to 
run this..

I thought about sticking a packet sniffer on the network, and sending him 
all his "secure" transactions.

I'm going to look over the code for obvious problems (heh heh that's an
understatement), but a cursory glance leads me to think it's an entry in
the Annual Poor Code Formatting contest. 

Ugh.. I'm so embarrased.
