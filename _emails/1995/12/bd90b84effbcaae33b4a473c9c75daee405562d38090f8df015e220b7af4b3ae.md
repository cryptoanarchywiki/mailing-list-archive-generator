This tidbit was posted a few hours ago on c|net (12/29 4:00 PST).

        Thanks to a wiretap on the Internet, three people have been arrested
for illegally 
        selling and manufacturing cellular phone equipment and electronic
devices over the Internet, 
        according to Secret Service agent Brian Gimlett. This is the first
time the Secret Service and the
        Drug Enforcement Administration were allowed to wiretap via the
Internet, says Gimlett. 

The rest of the story talks about an exchange of e-mail discussing the sale
of various nasty
cellular accessories.  There is no information on exactly what "wiretap"
means or any other
technical details.  Interesting to note the DEA was in on it.

Crypto-relevance only if the perps were using a remailer (which I kind of
doubt).
