Yes -- we have analogue A/V on a VHS cassette, digital MBone recording on M/O,
and an abstract ... see below.

    <DT>Speaker:
      <DD>Bill Chambers, King's College, University of London<P>

    <DT>Title:
      <DD>PROBLEMS OF STREAM CIPHER GENERATORS WITH MUTUAL CLOCK CONTROL<P>
  </DL>

    The speaker has been looking at the cycle structure of an algorithm
    posted just over a year ago on the Internet and alleged to be the
    secret A5 algorithm used for confidentiality in the GSM mobile
    telephone system. This algorithm employs three mutually
    clock-controlled shift registers, and can fairly quickly enter a
    loop with what is essentially the shortest possible period, a
    number very small compared with the total number of states, or even
    its square root. Moreover this behaviour is robust, not being
    influenced by factors such as choice of primitive feedback
    polynomial or even clocking logic (with a proviso to be
    discussed).  A fairly straightforward explanation for this
    behaviour has been found. Some ways of getting around the problem
    of excessively short periods are considered, as well as the
    behaviour of systems with different numbers of mutually clocked
    registers. In particular a mention is made of the wartime T52e
    cipher, perhaps the inspiration for "alleged A5".<P>
