	My inquiries regarding Rich's post of the X.9 informal notes
were rather fruitful. The chair of the working group seems interesting
in including anonymous token-based payment systems in the standard, "I
see no reason, other than interest, for the group to avoid
non-account-based payment systems, to complement the account-based
payment systems that we are now in the process of standardizing."

	Someone from Citicorp pointed me to http://www.llnl.gov/fstc
and asked for my feedback.

	These people do seem interested in anonymous systems, they
just don't have anyone who knows the stuff to work on it.
