A couple of weeks ago I was giving a talk at a conferance on
computer technology in financial applications in Stockholm.
I mentioned VISA:s electronic purse 'Smart Cash' in my talk
and during the break afterwards a representative from a danish
bank told me that VISA:s 'Smart Cash' was actually bought from
the danish purse/project 'Danmont'. Does anyone know the truth
of this, please let me know.
