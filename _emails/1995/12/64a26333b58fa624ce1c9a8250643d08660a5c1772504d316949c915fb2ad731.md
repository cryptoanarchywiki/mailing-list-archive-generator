This is much better than nothing. This would stop the e-mail being
sent to everyone who's ever posted to Usenet. I see a couple of attacks:

1. Alice only accepts signed e-mail from Bob. Carol receives a signed e-mail
from Bob to Carol, sends 10,000 e-mails to Alice (via sendmail) with From: bob,
same body+signature, possibly varying message-ids and subjects.

2. Alice only accepts signed e-mail from Bob. Carol, a rogue sysadmin,
intercepts an e-mail from Bob to Alice, sends 10,000 more copies of it to Alice
(via sendmail) with From: bob, possibly varying message-ids and subjects.

As I keep pointing out, pgp-signing the body is not enough.
