	This looks like they're using Diffie-Hellman. Does anyone know anything

V-One Unveils Internet Security Technology

   
   
   ROCKVILLE, Md. (Reuter) - V-One Corp. says it has introduced security
   technology called SmartGate that enables companies to build a secure
   system to conduct transactions on the Internet computer network.
   
   SmartGate is transaction-based software that uses encryption to ensure
   protection over an open network, the privately held company said
   Monday.
   
   Encryption scrambles the data and in the SmartGate system, a key to
   decode the data is generated that is unique to a specific transaction
   session.
   
   V-One, which stands for Virtual Open Network Environment, said
   SmartGate is available now directly from the Rockville, Md.-based
   company.
   
   It said SmartGate can be purchased in either a hardware-software or
   software-only form. The SmartGate server retails for $9,995 and the
   software-only version is $4,995. A server is computer that manages the
   flow of data in a network. SmartGate licenses are priced at $79, with
   reductions offered for volume purchases.
