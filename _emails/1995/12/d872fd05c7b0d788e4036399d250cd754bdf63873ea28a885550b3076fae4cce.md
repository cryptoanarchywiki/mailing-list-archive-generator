i don't think the maths works here ... let
Na = 257, Ea = 13, Da = 197, Nb = 263, 
Eb = 11, Db = 143

choosing M = 2, i calculate
C1 = 225, C2 = 144, C3 = 205, C4 = 33 != M
(and bottom bit is different)
choosing M = 7, i get
C1 = 127, C2 = 53, C3 = 19, C4 = 139 != M
(and top bit is different)

so your channel doesn't get the bit from alice to bob ...

the problem is that you are mixing reduction modulo two different numbers
Na and Nb ... this screws up the powering law you are trying to use.
