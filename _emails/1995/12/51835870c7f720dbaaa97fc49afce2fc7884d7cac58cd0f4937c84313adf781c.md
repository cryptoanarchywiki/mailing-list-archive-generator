Firearms dealers are requred to keep records of purchases.  In theory 
(and by law) they don't pass these records along to the authorities 
except in response to specific inquiries.

However, in the last couple of years there have been numerous reports of 
mass copying of records by BATF or surrogates (specifics on request).

And when a firearms dealer goes out of business, all records go to the BATF.

So there is something of a precedent.
