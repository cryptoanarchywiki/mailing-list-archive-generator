Alice has Alice gives Bob her key.  Cop wants Alice's key.  Cop tells
Bob "I want Alice's key, you need to give it to me. I don't have a
warrant."

How is this different from
Bob has key. Cop want's Bob's key. Cop tells Bob "I want your key,
you need to give it to me. I don't have a warrant."


	sheesh, what a fucked up legal system.
