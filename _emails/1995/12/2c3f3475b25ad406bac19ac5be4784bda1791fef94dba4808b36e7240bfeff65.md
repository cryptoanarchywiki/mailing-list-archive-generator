Heh. I'm still sorry I'll be missing this. I'm sadly going to be up in
Chicago that weekend getting ready for an internet security conference.

Since, I'm CC:ing this to the list, is anyone else going to be at 'Securing
Electronic Commerce on the Internet?' Thought it might be interesting to
dive out for dinner some evening with a few other Cpunk.
