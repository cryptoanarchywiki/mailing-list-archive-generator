	If there is no expectation of privacy when a key is escrowed
with Bob, or my companies attorneys, then would there be any
expectation of privacy under Clipper?  Perhaps this is a powerful
argument we should expect to have used against us...

	"Your honor, we argue that in escrowing his keys with the US
government, the defendant should have known his communications could
be listened to, and thus has no expectation of privacy."
