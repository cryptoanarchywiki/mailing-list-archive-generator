I see no evidence whatsoever that caching is taking place.  The
Alta Vista robot browsed the web site I manage for months prior to
public release, and behaved in exemplary fashion.  In short, they
appear to be managed by people who know what they're doing.  There's
nothing sinister about Alta Vista IMHO.

Furthermore, no one has mentioned the positive changes made to
Dejanews since it got bashed thoroughly on this list a few weeks ago.
They've significantly turned down the amount of old information
indexed, and have restricted the groups (and mailing lists) they
archive.
