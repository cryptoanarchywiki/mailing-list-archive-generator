After talking to a couple of people, and playing around some, this seems
to be a better choice.  That way, you can actually send information (including
a list of where to get other browsers) instead of just garbage to netscape
users.  Is anyone aware of browsers other than Netscape that do client pulls?

A simple filter to do (and undo) this would still be useful, I think so that
users can easily fix all their documents.  Fortunately, that would be very
easy to write.

That's not a bad idea either.  Hopefully, Netscape will post a retraction
(soon!) and none of this will be necessary.
