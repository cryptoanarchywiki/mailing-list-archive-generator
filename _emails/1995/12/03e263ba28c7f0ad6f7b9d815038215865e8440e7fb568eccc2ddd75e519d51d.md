And thus we return to my original point, which is that it will depend on 
what is said/disclosed.  If every copy of GAKscape had a banner, bigger 
than the Netscape "N" which said, "The government can read every message 
you send using this software no matter what you do" then I think 
consumers will be hard pressed to say they weren't warned.

I disagree.  Almost nobody read the fine print on the back of a note you 
sign when you buy a car or otherwise take out a loan, but the provisions 
are generally enforceable ...  Ignorance is not necessarily an excuse.
