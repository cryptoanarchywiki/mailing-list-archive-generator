[Note:  This is posted on behalf of Jack Lacy, whose news posting
software is hopelessly broken; please direct responses to him at
cryptolib@research.att.com.  Jack spent the better part of the last
two weeks getting a new release of CryptoLib out the door.  This version,
which should be stable for a while, fixes a few x86 problems, improves
the interfaces to some of the functions, and now allows you to use your
own random number generator to create key material.  If you don't
already have CryptoLib, be the first nerd on your block to get the
new release.  -matt]

Announcing CryptoLib - Release 1.1		12/21/95
   Jack Lacy, AT&T Bell Labs

CryptoLib is a portable and efficient library of primitives
for building cryptographic applications.  It runs under most versions
of Unix as well as DOS, Windows and Windows-NT (and 95).

We are pleased to make CryptoLib source code available without charge
to researchers and developers in the US and Canada.  (Because of export
restrictions on cryptographic software, we are only able to make the
software available within the US and Canada to US and Canadian citizens
and US permanent residents.)

CryptoLib is intended for research and experimental use, and is
distributed without warranty or support.  In particular, please
note the following license conditions:

 *              Copyright (c) 1995 by AT&T.

 * modification of this software and in all copies of the supporting
 * documentation for such software.
 *
 * This software may be subject to export controls.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * Some of the algorithms in cryptolib may be covered by patents.
 * It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that any required
 * licenses are obtained.
 *
 * SOME PARTS OF CRYPTOLIB MAY BE RESTRICTED UNDER UNITED STATES EXPORT
 * REGULATIONS.

The attached describes the library and some timing results.

		quantized RSA, DSA and El Gamal private key operations.
		
	support functions
		asn1.c
		ioutils.c
		netIface.c

Some timing information:

All times assume 32X32 bit assembly of multiplication primitives.

bigPow times (a^b mod c with a,b,c the same length)

		512 bits	1024 bits
		--------	---------
bigPow		0.12s		0.72s		Sparc II Brickell bigpow
		0.43s		3.0s		Sparc II with asm (gcc)
		0.12s		0.78s		Sparc 10 with asm
		0.03s		0.17s		Sparc 10 with asm (Brickell)
		0.084s		0.45s		SGI Indigo (150MHz)
		0.109s		0.75s		100 MHz Pentium (gcc under DOS)

Strong Prime Generation -- ProbTestAttempts = 5
100 primes generated in each test.  Times below are:
(total test time)/100 = avg. time per prime generated.
Using Gordon's strong prime algorithm.

    256		512	1024	Machine
    ---		---	----	-------
    2.8s	24.0s	5.11m	Sparc II 
    .45s	2.7s	77s	100 MHz pentium
	


	RSA Times (64 bit public exponent, message encrypted is full length)
	---------

		512	768	1024 bits	machine
		---	---	---------	-------
encrypt		30ms	50ms	80ms		sparc II
decrypt		160ms	480ms	930ms

encrypt		15ms	33ms	56ms		100 MHz Pentium (Under NT)
decrypt		38ms	104ms	214ms


	DSA Times

		512	768	1024 bits	machine
		---	---	---------	-------
sign		99ms	166ms	216ms		sparc II (Brickell speedup)
