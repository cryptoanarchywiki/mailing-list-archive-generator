It would not be very hard.  You just need to have all connections go through
a CGI script first.  There is a variable that reports the client to the
server.  Just bounce them to an error if the variable starts with "Mozilla".

Also, you do not need access to the server code to do this if you are using
NCSA.  There is a way you can force execution of CGI scripts from your local
directory using an .htaccess file.  (It requires using an "addtype" command
to enable the cgi parsing.)  I will have to dig out the exact mime type
required.

If I get some working Netscape bounce code, I will post it here.  (Actually
I want one that bounces AOL users to the Mr. Rogers home page on pbs.org.)
