Another vaguely-related concept is that of tenants' rights to a degree
of security in rental property.

My employer owns the workstation in front of me, but in exchange for
supplying them with software and ideas (when I'm not busy sending
e-mail to mailing lists ;-) they've "given" it to me to use in that
pursuit.  They could of course insist that I pay for it, like the old
company store model that railroad workers dealt with.  In a sense I
do pay for it, under the idea that the company would be able to pay me
more if not for the expense of the tools I need for the job.

Though the ownership==control equation works sometimes, and is
appealing to reason, I don't think things are always so simple.
