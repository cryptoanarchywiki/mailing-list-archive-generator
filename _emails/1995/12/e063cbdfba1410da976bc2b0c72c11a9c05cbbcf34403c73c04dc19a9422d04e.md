Clipper chips require fixed time to do a codebook cipher operation (exactly
64 clock ticks).  It's in the chip spec.

Capstone chips, on the other hand (as embodied in Tessera/Fortezza) have
public-key operations (DSA and a classified key exchange algorithm called
KEA that appears based on its interface to be El Gamal-like).  The cards
aren't supposed to reveal the secrets stored on them, ever.  There does
appear to be some variability in those functions, however.  I've not yet
reached any firm conclusions, however.
