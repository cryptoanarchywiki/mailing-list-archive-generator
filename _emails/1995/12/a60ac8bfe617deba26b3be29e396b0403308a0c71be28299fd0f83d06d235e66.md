Okay, here's how I understand things with PGP and Pegasus.  You have two
options with Pegasus depending on the set-up options you choose.  You can
either send upon completion of your out-going email, or you can have your mail
queued until you press the send out-going mail button.  The actual PGP process
does not occur until you actually send the mail.  So the answer would be: 
don't queue your mail.

What is life?  It is the flash of a firefly in the night.  It is the breath of a 
buffalo in the wintertime.  It is the little shadow which runs across the 
grass and loses itself in the sunset.
