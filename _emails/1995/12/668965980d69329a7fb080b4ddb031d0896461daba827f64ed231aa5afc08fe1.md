[I've read a bit more about Java since you last asked the question, 
coincidentally, but I don't know a huge amount about it yet.]

I think this scenario is certainly possible, from a technical point of view.

Crypto APIs in general should force the user to be aware of how she is using 
her key material. Ultimately you can't save people from themselves. (One
of my favorite non sequiturs. ;)  User education helps. But just as users
are tricked by various social engineering methods into divulging their account
passphrases, so they can be duped into encrypting or signing for a stranger's 
timing pleasure. 

However, one would certainly hope that the crypto Java interfaces that get
written are designed to mask timing information in the wake of Kocher. In
fact, this is precisely the sort of thing "we" should consider promulgating....
