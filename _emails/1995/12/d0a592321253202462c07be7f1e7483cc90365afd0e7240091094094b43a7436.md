I'm afraid you have missed the point too.

I don't care as much what the personal positions are, or what the ethical 
center from which person x or person y works.

I am most distressed because of what I see as a snowjob.

"We are anti-GAK"

Great, tell me what you have done to prevent GAK from proliferating.

In the absence of an answer to that challenge, I have to question the 
first statement as fluff or PR.

This has nothing to do with Netscape sharing my opinion, or not sharing 
my view on the evil of GAK.  It has to do with putting up or shutting 
up.  I have been told that Netscape agrees with me, or will agree with 
me, I just don't know that I believe it yet.

Uh... read the above again real carefully.  Think real hard about what

Isn't that what happens every day?  Or did something go anarchy while I

And this is what I am talking about.  Statements from Netscape and her 
employees are beginning to look more and more like mere fluff, lies, and 
time-buyers based on the belief that this kind of psycho babble is the 
way to conduct your affairs.

I know of no country that forbids private parties (cypherpunks list) from 
pointing out flaws and concerns with a product.  (accepting of course 
those countries which lack the basic free speech, or where the government 
owned industry is being commented on).  Your complaint about the 
potential liability of such statements was in reference to the 
cypherpunks, or at least a few on the list, being 'negative' about 
Netscape.  A private action for that, when based on fact, isn't 
actionable anywhere I know about.

Its the angry customer who walks out and takes his consumer cash 
elsewhere.  It amazes me how content everyone is to limit themselves.

I don't have a problem with the company that is money grubbing until they 
try to convince me that they are not and then fail utterly to back it up.
One might even say that's a form of fraud.

Except try and educate the common man.  Look like anything that has been 
going on here on the list?  Duh.

And griping and moaning isn't educating the common man because...?

Like sitting on hands.  Like admitting "there is nothing for (us) to do?"

I'd be happy if Joe Random became Joe Crypto.  Unlike you, I just don't 
assume that it has already happened.
