Unless I've missed something large, you can have an _uncertified_ key escrow 
agent store your keys in Fidel Castro's beard, and only release them with
written permission from your goldfish. 

Whether or not you use a certified key escrow agency would remain your 
choice, AFAIK.

I'm not expressing support for the certification standards that have been
presented. But I don't consider it cause for great alarm that the USG wants
to play in the escrow agent rating bureau business.
