Perhaps they've worked for a corporation? :-)

Certainly. In many organizations, the people who set policy, and the people
who "run" the corporation are not the same. Often important managers
disagree on issues or on how to achieve them. Individuals within the company
are often focused more on their careers and position within the company,
than on the affect their decisions have outside the company.

To equate an organization, especially a large one, with its constituent
parts ensures that you will be continually surprised by its complex and
unpredictable behavior.

BTW, the crypto relevance of this thread is nil.
