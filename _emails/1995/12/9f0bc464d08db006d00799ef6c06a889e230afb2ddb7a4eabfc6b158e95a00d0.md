The Bidzos show was recorded 12/8/95 at the Commonwealth Club 
in SF. It finished here at about 5:45 PM.


Only caught  a piece. Jim was answering written questions about 
a range of crypto and Internet security issues from the 
audience.


Among other things, he says they're working on an encryption 
program "closely tied to the OS of portables, to protect the 
data if the machine is lost or stolen."


He also said, "don't throw tomatoes," but they're doing 
something with "private key escrow" for those who want to 
provide access to their encrypted material in case of death or 
other emergency.


Maybe some other idle sinner saw more, or was at the realtime 
tomato-chucker.
