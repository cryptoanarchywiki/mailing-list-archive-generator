Nothing new here. Pornography and the other Three Horsemen will be use to
ban the spread of 'dangerous' thoughts on the Internet. This was clear
years ago. Let me emphasize a few facts:

o Non-GAK Encryption will be outlawed.
o 'Immoral' texts and pictures will be banned.
o The dissemination of 'dangerous ideas' will become a felony.

At best, Cypherpunks can hope to provide the infrastructure that will allow
an underground to communicate semi-securely. We are unable to stop the
global tidal wave of fascism. Let's not waste our time on bemoaning the
freedoms crushed in its path. We have more important work to do.
