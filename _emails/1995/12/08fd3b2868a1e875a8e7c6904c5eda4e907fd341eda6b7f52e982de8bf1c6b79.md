I don't have a CSERVE account, and never have.  But yesterday, I called a
friend (who has such an account) I talk to every two weeks or so.  The
conversation went something like this:

"Hi Greg."
"Hi Jim."
"I suggest that you get rid of your Comp..."   (he cuts me off in
mid-sentence, anticipating the entire subject of the call)
"I'm doing that as we speak, Jim"
"...because they just..."  (I continued the thought, but he cut me off again)
"That's EXACTLY why I'm doing it, Jim."
(mutual laughter as we realize the irony of the situation.)


Somehow, I think Compuserve is going to get the message.
