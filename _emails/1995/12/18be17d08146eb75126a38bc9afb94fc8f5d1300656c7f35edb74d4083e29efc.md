You must mean quantum crypto, by G. Brassard and C. Crepeau of U de Montreal.
Requires a direct fiber optic line from pt. A to B, in order to be 
secure, if I am not mistaken. Which makes it impractical for most people, 
as there are usually switches (or whatever they're called) and more than one 
line in between. Lets you use OTPs with your next-door neighbor though.
