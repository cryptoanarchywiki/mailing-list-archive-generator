I haven't seen 'good behavior' worth much notice yet.  Like I said, it 
takes about 10 minutes to come up with a written policy.  Netscape may 
have done more than that, but who's to say?

I'll be impressed when I see a sustained record of activism on the issue.
Till then they are slimy corporate types.  Which, IMHO, is fine so long 
as they don't claim to be anything else.
