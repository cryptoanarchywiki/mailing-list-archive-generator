IMHO, I see nothing wrong with predatory behavior.. then again, I hunt in
the fall, so it must be a redneck thing..

MS and any of the other software companies are competing for domination in a
narrow field.. MS just happens to be the only real choice for OS anymore..
well, for a standard, out of the box OS anyways. The fact that they have to
leave in undisclosed hooks to get their own software to excell over others
just points to the poor software they produce overall. 

I have to admit that I like, possibly admire, the way the Bill and crew have
captured the market.. from a marketing standpoint, they did a first rate job
of running with the ball until there was no pursuit.. Sure, from time to
time, someone tries to throw a blocker in thier path, but they just overrun
it and keep going.. Forget about the monopoly aspects for a second and look
at MS as an American success story. It has all the classic elements: started
small, with a crew of social misfits and eventually grew up.

Just a few cents worth..
