If you had read and understood Applied Cryptography you would
understand the paper. I'm sorry, but to paraphrase a smarter man than
I, there is no royal road to cryptography. You have to study it.

The only thing that can be said to a layman is that different keys
will require different amounts of times to deal with different texts
in certain public key systems, so by timing how long it takes to
perform operations you can get information about the keys.
