All of which raises numerous opportunities for sting operations against
politicians, done by individuals by procedures provided for under law.
Escrow (Okay, I know that's a dirty word around here, but...) an encrypted
statement of how you intend to run the sting, to be opened by the escrow
agent at some point in the future, explaining who you're going after and
how.  Make the contribution, keep evidence, and if you're successfull the
congressman goes to jail for a few years.
