   12-2-95. NYPiper:

   "Accord Reached For Limiting Smut on Internet." Page One
   lead.

      Bowing to a seemingly unstoppable push in Congress to
      keep sexual material off the Internet, a coalition of
      commercial on-line services and some civil liberties
      groups agreed today to accept a number of restrictions
      they had opposed a few months ago.

   "Terrorism Bill Plan May Break Deadlock." Tiny article.

      In a bid to salvage a stalled antiterrorism bill, the
      chairman of the House Judiciary Committee has agreed to
      the demands of conservative Republicans to remove
      proposals expanding the Government's wiretapping
      authority.
