Great job. A couple of suggestions...

Version histories, with differences in each version. Also good to
debunk the "PGP before version x isn't safe to use" myth.  Might also
want to throw in info about PGP hacks (mainly outside US), development
of other software like SecureDrive, SFS, HPack (an archiver that uses
PGP keys for digital signatures of files or encryption), development
of anonymous remailers that use PGP, and even something about planned
future developments (PGP 3.0, PGPPhone, etc...)
