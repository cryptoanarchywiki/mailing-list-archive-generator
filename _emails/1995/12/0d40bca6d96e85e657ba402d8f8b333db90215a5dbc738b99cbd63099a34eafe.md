Friend, 
 
 
You may wish to inform yourself about the FTC Privacy Initia- 
tive: 
 
 The US Federal Trade Commission has launched a "Privacy Initia- 
 tive" to investigate whether the information collected at web- 
 sites (either that affirmatively submitted by a visitor via a 
 form or information collected based upon a visitor's selection 
 of pages at a site to reflect personal interests) should be the 
 subject of regulation by the FTC. 
 
 To get background on this effort, you may want to read a speech 
 by FTC Commissioner Varney on Electronic Commerce and Privacy 
 which is available at the FTC's site under speeches 
 
                     http://www.ftc.gov 

 or [at] the Advertising Law Internet Site 
 
             http;//www.webcom.com/~lewrose/home.html 
 
 under speeches. 
 
 This week the staff of the FTC established a mailing list to 
 allow interested parties to discuss the issues surrounding the 
 privacy interests of consumers visiting web sites.  To subscribe, 
 send the message 
 
                        subscribe 

 to 
 
                  privacy-request@ftc.gov 
 
 
                          ---- 
 
 
The above is an excerpt from a 12 20 95 message to another list. 
 
 
Cordially, 
 
Jim
