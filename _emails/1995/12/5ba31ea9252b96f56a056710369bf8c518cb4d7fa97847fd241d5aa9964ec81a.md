The customer has a private key.  Customer info on their machine is
encrypted under a password.

Billing address establishment is part of shopping.  It need not be
the card billing address.  But the customer needs to enter an
addreess when setting up their credit card. see
	draft-eastlake-cybercash-v08-01.txt
in any of the IETF shadow directories.

The customer signs the message including the merchant id and order id
before encrypting a bunch of stuff including the credit card number
to send to the merchant.  There isn't anything useful to steal from
the ecnrypted part of that message.
