I'm doing it now - software.net serves distinct ads to Mac, Windows, Text
and Unix based browsers.  

On the name database side the PO runs somthing called National Change of Address
which tracks who moved where and allows direct marketing companys to clean
their lists.  Almost everybody sells address change data (utilities, the PO,
credit companys) - I'm getting tons of "welcome to the neighbourhood" mail
since I moved.
