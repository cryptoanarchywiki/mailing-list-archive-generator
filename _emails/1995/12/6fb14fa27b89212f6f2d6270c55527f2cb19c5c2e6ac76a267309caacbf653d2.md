        Oh that is clever! (Security through obscurity!)  Make it all the
harder to back up the file!  I had the minimal amount of security W95 allows
one to have by having the default user not be able to do anything, then the
me user to everything (for which you needed a password...)  Of course my
registry got corrupted (eudora beta for W95) and the only damn thing it did
remember was that the default user couldn't do anything, and it no longer
knew who I was...
        So now, I don't even bother with that, I'm just hoping securdrv,
sfs, or something makes it to W95 one of these days... (I doubt either of
those will make it...)
