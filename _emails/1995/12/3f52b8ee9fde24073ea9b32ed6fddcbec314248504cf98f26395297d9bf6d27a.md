Since an online clearing protocol is being used, the bank has no need to
identify double spenders. The bank will simply refuse to honor a double
spent coin. In fact, cancelling a payment in this protocol is done by just
depositing the coin yourself.

I can't help the feeling that I am missing something whenever you bring up
this question. Assuming it could be done. What would David gain? He as the
payor is anonymous to Sam either way. Sam still would have to be worried
about being identified, since if Charlie gives David access to Charlie's
wallet, it is safe to assume that Charlie will give David (and the mint)
access to his blinding factor. Which in turn would reveal Sam as the payee.

The protocol you suggest gives the parties exactly what they would have if
they just used Ecash "out of the box": full payor anonymity, no payee
anonymity. So why bother?
