Can anyone tell me whether Ian Goldberg and David Wagner got their $25,000
from Netscape for finding the HUGE security flaws in Netscape's existing 
product line??

I can't remember whether they got anything or not ...

(Sorry, but I've been away from the list.  One of those, "fate of the 
Free World hangs in the balance" thingies ... ;-)

Have Netscape and AT&T shown some holiday goodwill, or are they still 
engaged in their felonious freeloading foolishness?
