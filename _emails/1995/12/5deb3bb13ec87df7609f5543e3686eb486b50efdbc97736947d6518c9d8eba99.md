I dont know if this is a good idea.
I think CI$ shut off the newsgroups due to economic presure-
from some German officials.  Drop them or we ban CI$.

Now, if CI$ were to shed excess customers in the rest of
the world... they might just turn those newsgroups back on.

So if folks turned on twit filters and deleted-before-reading
mail from anyone@compuserve - and if folks, newsletters etc
refused to SEND mail to accounts@ci$ 
  ...  well if enough ci$ customers were to LEAVE.

This is not a proposal..some of my best friends are at compuserve.
