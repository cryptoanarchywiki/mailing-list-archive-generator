I would like to thank all people who gave me pointers; with the
help of my sysadmin at Utopia we were able to compile and install it.

two comments for matt thoo:

 1: please make it install 'out-of-the-box' on Linux.

 2: please rename the ssh shell programm, 
    it did overwrite my ssh/slogin programm.

All things said; thanks for really wonderfull programm.

 -AJ-

ps: Merry Xmas and a Happy NewYear 2all !
