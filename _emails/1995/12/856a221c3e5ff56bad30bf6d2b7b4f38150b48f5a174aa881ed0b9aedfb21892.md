Actually, you filled out some paperwork when you signed up that was sent 
forward; it wasn't much more than a check against all of the govts "evil type 
people" databases.  However, I understand that it depends on what Level of 
background check as well.  A limited background investigation involves 
filling out a long form saying that you've been a good boy/girl; it goes up 
from there.  "Civilians" are different from military as well; after all, in 
one they own you, in the other, you can actually go home at night.;-)

Nothing I say can be held as the viewpoint of my employer; I'm a short-timer 
any, so I really don't care what they think!
