I know that a week or so ago, there was a hearing in San Jose regarding
Roger Schafly's (sp.) case against RSA.  How did the hearing come out?  I
never saw a post... :(

"Past the wounds of childhood, past the fallen dreams and the broken families,
through the hurt and the loss and the agony only the night ever hears, is a
waiting soul.  Patient, permanent, abundant, it opens its infinite heart and
asks only one thing of you ... 'Remember who it is you really are.'"
