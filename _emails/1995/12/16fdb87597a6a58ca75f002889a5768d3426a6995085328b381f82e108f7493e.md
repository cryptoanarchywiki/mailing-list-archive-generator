Look, Ma!  Java code!

Real cyph3rpunks, of course, flame each other anonymously.

(Incidentally, I got tired of Alice making it to my noise box, and the
following seems to work well.  Deleting the leading ^ characters would
cause all responses to go into the junk box; perhaps a good idea.
This is, for those of you who don't recognize it, procmail code.  My
mail filter of choice for hacking in.)
