Credit where credit is due.

I for one am satisfied--and even pleased--with the Netscape position on GAK.

It remains to be seen how steadfast Netscape, as the major player in the
Web browser business, remains in the face of (likely) pressure from the
government.

It seems to me that we have have been quick to criticize Netscape--which is
good, the quickness part--and thus we should be equally quick to praise
them. To be sure, various of us might've written the Netscape position
statement slightly differently, but this does not change the basic point:
that Netscape has come out against the Administration's position on GAK.

For this they deserve our praise.
