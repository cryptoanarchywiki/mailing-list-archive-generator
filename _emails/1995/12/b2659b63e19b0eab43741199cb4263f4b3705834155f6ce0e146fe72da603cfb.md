This will be really difficult, and in practice rather pointless.  NT does
not allow any user, priviliged or not, to gain access to any form (encrypted
or not) of the passwords.  They are stored in a protected area of the system
registry that only the OS itself can access.  The best that you can do is
to ask the OS whether a given username/password pair is valid or not, and it
took until version 3.51 before MS let you do even that!

Of course, rebooting the PC and inspecting the disk with another OS is not
an answer since in any decent environment you will not be able to march up
to the server with a floppy and hit the reset button!
