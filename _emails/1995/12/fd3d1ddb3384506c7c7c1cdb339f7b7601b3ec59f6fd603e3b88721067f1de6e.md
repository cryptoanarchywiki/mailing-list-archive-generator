AUTHOR A VIRUS, GO TO JAIL
A computer cracker last week became the first virus writer sentenced to a
jail term under Great Britain's Computer Misuse Act.  The 26-year-old
perpetrator was sentenced to 18 months in jail after pleading guilty to 11
charges connected with placing virus-infected programs on computer bulletin
boards.  (Investor's Business Daily 29 Nov 95 A6)
