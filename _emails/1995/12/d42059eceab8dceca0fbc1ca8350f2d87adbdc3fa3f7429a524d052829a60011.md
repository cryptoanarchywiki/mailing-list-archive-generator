I believe this is a good thing (tm).
This is a vendor with strong crypto implementing Key Escrow for
the only known commercially viable market: data recovery of long
term storage.

In all of the NIST meetings that I've attended, industry says
there is a market for key escrow for data recovery when your
key  programmer "falls in love and moves to a warm water island"

They also say there is no market for key escrow for communication,
we can simply resend lost messages.

Commercial Key Escrow is, by definition, voluntary. You have to pay
to get it escrowed, stored, and returned. CKE is not GAK.

I bet its not exportable.
