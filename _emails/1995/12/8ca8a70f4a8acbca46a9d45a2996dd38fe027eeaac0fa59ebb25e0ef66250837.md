Do you wish to substantiate this rather brazen assertion?  
I am very sure that PGP public key 0xCC56B2E9 belongs to my
housemate Sebastian Kuzminsky <kuzminsk@colorado.edu>.  Is
there some reason why I should doubt this belief?


Furthermore my mother <rwilcox@mesa5.mesa.colorado.edu>
<0x5E93210D> is very sure that PGP public key 0x617c6db9
belongs to me, and she is very sure that I am a trustworthy
introducer of keys.  Is there some reason why she should
abstain from associating Seb's key <0xCC56B2E9> in her mind
with my housemate?

But if I am the victim of a successful active attack then you
are *not* certain that I am the same Bryce.  The Bryce who
posted a certain article in the archives might be completely
different from (and antagonistic toward!) the Bryce who later
contacts you in e-mail using the same public key.  Do you see
why?


> We should blow off this attempt to do the impossible.


It is far from impossible.  In fact, it is easy if we pay
attention and cooperate.  


Note that I am in complete agreement with you about the (non-)
value of "True" identities.  In the above example I do not 
expect you to care which Bryce is the "real" Bryce, but I *do* 
expect you to care that the two Bryces are different.


In short, the Web O Trust is important to maintain constancy
of identity.  It is not trivial, but neither is it impossible,
to do so.

Bryce, a unique and autonomous entity
