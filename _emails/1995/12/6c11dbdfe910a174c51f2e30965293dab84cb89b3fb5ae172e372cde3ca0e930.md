      In a discussion of governmental efforts to deny presumedly innocent
citizens the assurance that they can conduct their affairs in privacy --
and to require that "trusted," "impartial" escrow agents employ someone
who has been vetted according to undisclosed criteria, the best you can
come up with is this "conspiracy theory" saw? Did *I* invent this
stipulation?

      Therefore, *every* GAK escrow agent *must* employ someone with an
arbitrary clearance level?

      And what protected him? Incompetence, cronyism, corruption, and
ass-covering. Of course, any failures in GAK administration would be
handled differently...

      I get the point. I *disagree* with it.

      On the *hardware* front, definitely -- if not by law then simply by
practical need. Does the hardware in question *necessarily* apply to every
citizen in America?
