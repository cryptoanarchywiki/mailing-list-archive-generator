Not *that* much computer time...

In my copy of Hans Dobbertin's paper, the abstract says 

``An implementation of our 
attack allows to find collisions for MD4 in less than a minute on a PC.''

As far as I know, the difficulty of inverting MD4 is still an open
problem -- but why would you want to use a broken algorithm like MD4
when you can use MD2, MD5, or SHA?
