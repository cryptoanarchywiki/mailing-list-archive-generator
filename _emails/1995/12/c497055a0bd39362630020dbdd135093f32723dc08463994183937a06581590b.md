My untrained brain sees two problems with this:

1) Cellular systems are inherently less secure than standard telephones,
as anyone who can afford a decent scanner can listen to your conversations
at will.

2) You're relying on someone other than yourself to protect your security,
which is always a bad idea. Cellular carriers, Ma Bell, anyone. Does anyone
on this list really believe that representatives of these organizations
would think twice about bending over and spewing out everything they know
about you? They do it all the time, without your permission and without
valid court orders.
