I feel slighted.  No one accused me of lacking principles because I 
haven't quit my job with the Justice Department based on its, and the 
Administration's, position.

Then again, maybe you just realize that the market for lawyers, and the 
market for people who can actually do something worthwhile, is very 
different.

Nevertheless, I won't think less of Jeff if he doesn't quit.  He appears 
to be fighting what most here believe is the good fight.  Refusing to 
take his ball and go home does not mean, to me, that he lacks 
principles.  Perhaps it means that he thinks he can do more from within.

Gee, and Tim May didn't get a new ISP when his current PC-ISP canceled 
his Usenet access because of his protected speech and then gave it back 
only if he included a disclaimer on his messages.  Fire away, Cypherpunks!!!
