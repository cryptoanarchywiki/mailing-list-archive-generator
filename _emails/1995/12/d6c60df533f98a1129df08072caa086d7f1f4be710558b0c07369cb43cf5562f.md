You're wrong.

Maybe they don't like the terms of the gpl?  Maybe they don't want
to restrict *you* to having to give it away?  (And before you jump
my ass for being anti-gnu, go check the various GNU sources for work
I've submitted in the past.)

Is this where we point out that it was Young Master Blaze who pointed out the
technical failure in Clipper?

"Cypherpunks write code."  (Where is yours?)
