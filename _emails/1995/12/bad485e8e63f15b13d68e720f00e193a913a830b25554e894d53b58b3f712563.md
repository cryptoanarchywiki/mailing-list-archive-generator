      Gee, Tim, this is *your* thesis?

>dominant OS company, are in special positions to "build in Big Brother."

      And?

      Not strong at all, actually.

      [self-congratulations deleted]

      Like many entrepreneurs, he is an opportunist in every sense, good
and bad. He has yet to advance -- "graduate" maybe -- beyond that point.
NS's stance re GAK is a golden opportunity for Mr. Bubble either to
graduate or to get popped: either patted on the back by Papa State or
popped in the noggin. When "opportunity" is at stake, he's a shrewd
maneuverer; but when pitting his integrity against federal charges is at
stake, he's still a kid -- he doesn't see the opportunity in it.

>And time is of the essence. Things move very fast. It is no longer the case

>"partners" from the start, as we saw with the Clipper development (where

      Partner, schmartner: "partners" can be adversarial, and adversarial
relations can become *very* adversarial. Here's the question: is the dog
gonna wag the tail or vice versa? The USG has, as we all know,
demonstrated its infinite capacity to knuckle under in the face of
hardened opposition, whether announced or de facto. NS is in a privileged
position to drag the LEA establishment onto the mat, with the whole of the
American public watching. And it stands to gain from doing so, as do we
all.
      But Mr. Bubble wants to be friends, wants to receive genteel toasts.
      With the kind of money Mr. Bubble stands to make -- whether from NS
or from subsequent ventures -- he should be maybe just a bit tougher. If
he's looking for models, names like Carnegie and and Bismarck come to
mind. (Note that their progeny *still* have money, not 2 years later but
*generations* later.)

      On the contrary, it is sheer speculation that negotiations about GAK
*haven't* been going on. This shit doesn't happen by magic.

>not an indication that GAK is being considered within Netscape, but maybe
>it is. After all, one rarely hears "only if we have to" qualifications on
>things that are truly from out in left field.

      Yes.

>And what Netscape agrees to put in future releases of its browsers or its
>servers could have dramatic effects on the whole climate.

      Yes.


      [social darwinism deleated]

>Should Netscape play ball with the NSA or refuse to cooperate? I'm not
>suggesting that Netscape "break the law." Actually, there are *no* laws at

      NS should implement strong crypto, make it publicly available by FTP
and in a box, and see how the USG responds. The public is on its side.

>And if export laws demand GAK in exported products, Netscape should "do the

      Yes.

>(Explain something to me. I have never, ever understood why it is a concern
>of the U.S. government that we help build in GAK for foreign governments,
>that we make sure that products intended for export to France or Syria have

      Because it isn't interested in freedom, here or anywhere else. It is
interested in a "controlled burn" distribution of stability and
instability. Its willingness to do business with its "enemies" has been
amply demonstrated.
      But your drift is clear, and it is right.

>If the U.S. insists on GAK _within the U.S._, as many of us fear is the
>long-term danger, then all bets are off anyway. But I would hope that
>Netscape does nothing to make it _easier_ to make this the case!

      On the contrary: That's when bets are on. That's when *you* -- and
all of us -- might have to start putting our money and our homes in
Corralitos on the line. That's when Black Unicorn will upload the papers
he claims to have, when I will start wrapping PGP-encrypted mail in
pretty-looking wrappers. That's when we'll have no one but ourselves to
blame. Not even Netscape.

      Yes. But NS should act first, explain second. If NS wants money,
that's how to get it.

>Enough for now.

      Yes.
