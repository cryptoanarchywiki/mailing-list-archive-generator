I don't think that the local freenet folks are ever going to get my domain name 
again, so I'm officially announcing the closing of the remailer formerly located
"remailer@ideath.goldenbear.com". Mail to the goldenbear.com domain has been bou
for almost three weeks now, and I expect that to continue. Sorry for any inconve
I predict about a year of erratic net access and moving around while I finish la
school, take the bar exam(s), and find a job or get a business started. When eve
settles down I plan to find a reliable net connection and run a remailer again. 

Due to the loss of my domain name and UUCP connectivity, other changes are happe

I'm now using a Windows box, not a Unix box, for my net access; have switched to
for DOS and Private Idaho (nice job, Joel!).

Am also using a new PGP key, since my old one (0x58ddf30d) was almost 3 years ol
updated the MIT PGP keyserver with an "obsolete" marker for the old key, as well
new key (signed by my old key). The new key is appended to this message.

Am using a new long-term E-mail address, "gbroiles@netbox.com". Re my discussion
weeks ago of alternatives for mail storage/forwarding, I have settled on netbox.
can receive mail as "gbroiles@darkwing.uoregon.edu" but I expect that address to
working sometime this coming May. The netbox.com address will ideally keep worki
years to come.
