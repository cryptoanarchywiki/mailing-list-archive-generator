I've just released details of an attack many of you will find 
interesting since quite a few existing cryptography products and 
systems are potentially at risk.  The general idea of the attack is
that secret keys can be found by measuring the amount of time used to
to process messages.  The paper describes attacks against RSA, fixed-
exponent Diffie-Hellman, and DSS, and the techniques can work with 
many other systems as well. 

My research on the subject is still in progress and the current paper 
does not include many of my findings.  I will eventually publish a full 
paper, but am releasing a preliminary draft now to alert the community 
as quickly as possible.  A copy of the abstract is attached at the end 
of this message and the full text can be downloaded in PostScript 
format from:

  ftp://ftp.cryptography.com/pub/kocher_timing_attack.ps
  ftp://ftp.cryptography.com/pub/kocher_timing_attack.ps.gz

I've also made an HTML version which is accessible at:

  http://www.cryptography.com

(The HTML uses subscripts and superscripts which aren't supported 
in older web browsers.  The PostScript version is the "official" 
one and looks nicer.)

The results have already been seen by Matt Blaze, Martin Hellman, Ron 
Rivest, Bruce Schneier, and many others.  While the full significance
of the attack is not yet known, I think everyone who has seen it 
considers it important (including Netscape who awarded me a $1000 
bugs bounty prize). 


    ABSTRACT.  Cryptosystems often take slightly different 
    amounts of time to process different messages. With network-
    based cryptosystems, cryptographic tokens, and many other 
    applications, attackers can measure the amount of time used 
    to complete cryptographic operations.  This abstract shows 
    that timing channels can, and often do, leak key material.  
    The attacks are particularly alarming because they often 
    require only known ciphertext, work even if timing 
    measurements are somewhat inaccurate, are computationally 
    easy, and are difficult to detect.  This preliminary draft 
    outlines attacks that can find secret exponents in Diffie-
    Hellman key exchange, factor RSA keys, and find DSS secret 
    parameters.  Other symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic 
    functions are also at risk. A complete description of the 
    attack will be presented in a full paper, to be released 
    later. I conclude by noting that closing timing channels 
    is often more difficult than might be expected. 


Cheers,
Paul Kocher
