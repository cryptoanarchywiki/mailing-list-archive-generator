You comment is sufficiently short and cryptic that it's a bit hard to
tell what your point is.  Different services are good for different
things.  Most of the merchant's signed up with CyberCash currently
sell hard goods that they phsically ship to you.  They have different
needs from the on-line information vendors that FV primarily serves
at this time.

But both CyberCash and, I understand, FV plan to expand their service
repertoire. 

If you want to use your credit card or bank account via CyberCash, you
need to go though an authentication step to link them.  If you don't
want to use a credit card or bank account, there is no requirement
to provide any real identity information when you set up a CyberCash
persona.
