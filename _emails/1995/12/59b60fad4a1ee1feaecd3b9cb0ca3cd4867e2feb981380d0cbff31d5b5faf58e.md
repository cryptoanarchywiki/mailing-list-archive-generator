I went to

http://www.cryptography.com/timingattack.html

and found the whole thing to be totally incomprehensible from
a layman's point of view.  I apologize for having not read
"Applied Cryptography", which might have made the abstract a
simpler read - but even if I had I'd have been baffled by a
lot of the terminology and equations in this paper.

Can anyone post a brief summary which explains the essential
workings of the attack?  I'd be very grateful.
