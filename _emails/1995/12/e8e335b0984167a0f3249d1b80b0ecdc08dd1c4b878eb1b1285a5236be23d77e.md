I think it's more likely that a group of people will work on
breaking Big Co's GAKed product.  Either finding a flaw
in it's algorithm or protocol that can be exploited, or
a flaw that renders it's GAK unusable, i.e. Matt Blaze's
LEAF hack on Clipper.

Well, NAACP is an actual organization with papers filed
with the IRS, officers or some sort of board members, offices, etc.

Cypherpunks is just a mailing list, and many of the members
of the list don't use their real identies on the list.

Who would they go after?
