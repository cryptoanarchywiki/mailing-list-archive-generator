	"forcing" a change on DejaNews to strip addresses would defeat
    the "redeeming" value of such a database. Since I, like many, 
    occasionally fall into the trap of opening my response before
    clutching in my brain, I used DejaNews to "count" the gaffes! 
    Fortunely, none on that search, just the usual sloppy keyboard entry.
	and, coming down on DejaNews just puts the fire out in just one 
    room of a conflagration.

	Searching with a news reader message by message would be more than
    painful!  all they need to do to obtain names from any newsgroup 
    is to scan the entire news base, or groups of interest. It took me 
    less than a minute to strip names from the alt.religion tree.
	I dont think the spammers are too worried about adding a few names 
    when groups are sorted by interest anyway.

	for amusement, I have started to code a simple program which
    takes a feed from procmail where known spammers are listed and it 
    prepends a message about spamming and send 1 - n copies to the 
    offenders' PostMaster.  ...and, I will send them from my own address 
    as a token of my affection....

	The only aggravation is adding offender to procmail after finding 
    the source as many are using remailers.  If they have 800 numbers, 
    there are always auto-dialers with a message.. ..

	I hate to waste the bandwidth, but the spammers are getting out 
    of hand and procmail -> /dev/null is less than satisfying!
