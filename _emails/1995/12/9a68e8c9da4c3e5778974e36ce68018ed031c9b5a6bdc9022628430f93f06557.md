Bob's Fourth Amendment rights are not triggered by his contract with 
Alice.  Alice can be compelled to give up the key (by testimony or 
production) and giving up that key does not tend to incriminate *Alice* 
in a violation of law.  Alice can't invoke Bob's rights against 
self-incrimination for obvious reasons:  Alice isn't Bob.
