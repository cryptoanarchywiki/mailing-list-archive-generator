	actually, you need to produce it in volume for $50 to $62.50 in 
order to afford the overhead, sales effort, service effort, advertising, 
and that good stuff.

	other than the floppy drive, I can make it for less than $50 in 
exportd cost from HingKong with a 486-33 knockoff.  Of course, you will 
charge the cusotmer extra for the 256M extra memory....
