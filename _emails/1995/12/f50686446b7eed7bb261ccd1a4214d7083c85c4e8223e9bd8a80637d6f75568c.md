	Not if the fixed time is in weeks.

	If you read the Crypto proceedings, you'll find a number of
papers on using an (untrusted) CPU, such as that in a cash machine, to
aid a smartcard.  This is because the CPUs in smartcards are very
slow.

	Maximchuck, at Bell Labs, has a protocol for Anonymous Credit
Cards which uses pre-chosen private keys between correspondants and a
set of remailers to anonymize credit card transactions with respsect
to a merchant. (The bank still knows who's buying how much, and I
think where.)  Anyway, he freely admits that the reason for private
key work is their cards couldn't handle the public key operations.
