   I've tried to find out the answers to my
questions myself but I haven't been very successful.
Actually, I haven't been successful at all.  First of all,
I've been using PGP on my computer but when I tried to port it
over to my unix account it didn't work.  I took the source code
and tried to compile it using the unix g++ compiler but it gave
me all of these errors.  Where can I find PGP that is already
compiled for unix or at the very least will compile for unix?
Secondly, if I create a program that makes using PGP more
user friendly can I let other people have it ( for FREE )?
Lastly, what is considered overkill with cryptography?
I don't believe anything is.  My programs accept what the user
inputs for how large prime numbers should be ( my public
key programs ) but I make them able to accept values that go
up to 30720 bits ( I don't believe a number can ever be large
enough ).  You can never be to safe...never.
