  Sorry, I was referring to the official Netscape company position, not
the personal position of either myself or Jim Clark.

> I would like to hear Jim Clark say "GAK is bad".

  So would I.  I don't know if he will take such a position or not.
I do believe that the company, Netscape, will take such a position
in the coming week.

  I've been trying to use either GAK, or "mandatory key escrow" to
refer to the hated beast.  If I've used just "key escrow" in that
context, I'm sorry.  I've been trying to use the term "key escrow"
for cases when it is not mandatory.

  I haven't read his book.  Did he take a position against GAK?  Did
he say that if GAK is required by law his company would or would not
implement it?  A summary of his comments on this topic would be
informative.
