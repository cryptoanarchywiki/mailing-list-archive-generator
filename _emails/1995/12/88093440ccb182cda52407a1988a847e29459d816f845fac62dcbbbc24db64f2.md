    Now be practical.  You do have options.  Just because you have the 
capability to encrypt with a 30000 bit key does NOT mean that it is
mandated that you encrypt with a 30000 bit key.  The reason that cypherpunks
is even in existence is that sometimes privacy is a must.  Sometimes
you want to make sure that a common thief can not read your files and 
others you want to make sure the N.S.A. can not read your files.  This
is not in dispute.  We all know this.  Having the option is comforting ( in
my opinion of course ).
