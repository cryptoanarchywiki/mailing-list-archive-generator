	no, i am not sure.  but after reading the paper carefully that is 
what i conclude.  on page 4 start of the 4th paragraph "The Chinese 
Remainder Theorem RSA attack can also be adapted to use only known 
ciphertext, and thus can be used to attack RSA digital signatures."

	the key here is "known ciphertext": you have both the message and 
its encrypted version.  When Alice signs Bob's public key, with her 
private key of course, she is encrypting Bob's public key.  this allows 
Charlie to use Alice's public key to decrypt the signature, recovering a 
message that is identical to Bob's public key.  that's the proof that 
Alice was the signer.

	no, i am not sure.   anyone see holes in this?
