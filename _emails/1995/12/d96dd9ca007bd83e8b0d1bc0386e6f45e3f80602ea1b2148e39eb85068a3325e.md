Good grief.  This is not good ... not good at all.

Oh no ... it's worse ... *sigh* ... 

no wonder that Newt and Dole had such a grim look on their faces when they
emerged from their scheduled one-hour, (went for two) meeting with the US
President -- the one that was the day before the freshman congress persons
did their incredible end-run on their own leadership. 

Impressive.  Truly.

What would have caused both Newt and Dole to flush like they did?  Did
they demo a hack into the personal e-mail of the Vice-Chairman of the JCS?

Pretty firewall ... nice firewall ... <p>

Good idea.  ISDN dialup provides significant bandwidth.  Very significant
bandwidth. Almost enought to control a battleship.  (If there were any
battleships, I mean).

Yep.  Perfect.  Just what the doctor ordered.  TCP/IP to every desktop.
And MIME for all.  Oh, and to ice the cake, toll-free ISDN dial-ins.

Hmm, let's see ... for Christmas Santa ... I'd like a packet-switched 
network with a public outdial to a toll-free ISDN dial-in ... oh, that 
and a Gulfstream V under the Christmas tree.

What are they going to do next, give everyone some Czechoslovakian C-4?

Stick a bit of civilian software into all of this, and let's all have a
good look at whether someone can take over something a little more
interesting than a battle ship. 

Like maybe an aircraft carrier?? 

Gee, that oughta harden their drawers ...
