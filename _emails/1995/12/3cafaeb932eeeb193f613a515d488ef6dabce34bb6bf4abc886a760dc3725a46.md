folks, say yes to proof reading.

sorry to perpetuate this thread any more but as one of the resident
biochemists/mol biologists i've got an itch to scratch.

in the lines with the single '>' above, you need to replace the word
'exon' with 'intron'.


    exons --> DNA sequences in a gene that (can) yield protein after splicing

    introns --> DNA sequences that are interspersed between exons in a gene


introns have several known roles, including roles in RNA splicing and
RNA editing (a process that sort of skirts the central dogma of 
DNA -> RNA -> protein by changing the 'code' in the RNA).

non-coding sequences represent the bulk of DNA, and for the most part
it's role is unknown although various people have their pet theories.
gene regulation is often carried out by non-coding sequences,
including sequences that are never transcribed into RNA.  thus, they
can be involved in any cancer process.
