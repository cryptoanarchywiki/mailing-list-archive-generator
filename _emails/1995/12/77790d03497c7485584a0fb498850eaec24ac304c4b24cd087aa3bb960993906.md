   12-24-95. NYPaper:

   "Money Laundering, New and Improved. To really hide loot,
   wait for the arrival of 'cybercash.' "

      The days when you could trust a Swiss banker to hold on
      to your millions and keep his mouth shut are long gone.
      Embarrassing disclosure incidents are forcing any money
      launderer worth his pocket change to go high-tech, using
      the wonder of home-banking computer programs to zip
      money across borders. What American authorities fear the
      most, however, is the rise of "cybercash."

      "The nightmare of it is that there is no registration of
      every transaction, the way there is if you use a Visa or
      Mastercard," said Stanley E. Morris, who heads the
      financial crimes enforcement network.
