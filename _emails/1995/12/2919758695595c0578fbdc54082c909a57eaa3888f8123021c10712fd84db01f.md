The only problem with this approach is that this will bite other 
browsers that have started supporting the so-called "Netscape 
extensions".  More than one person has coded the Netscape stuff into 
their pages because it gives the author more flexibility than the 
standard 1.0/2.0 standards.  And there aren't many browsers out there 
yet that support 3.0.
