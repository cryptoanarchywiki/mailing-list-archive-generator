Here's one more reason to worry about the implications of web search
engines: I just stopped in on Digital's new Alta Vista page, and was
surprised to find that the query field was filled in--with a search I ran
3 or 4 days ago. I doublechecked my end pretty thoroughly (scrubbing all
the files that Netscape 2.0b3 [Mac] generates--caches, global history,
etc., and eventually reinstaling Netscape from scratch). And it look an
awful lot like Alta Vista cached by query according to my IP address.
      Maybe dynamically assigned IPs ain't such a bad idea after all...
