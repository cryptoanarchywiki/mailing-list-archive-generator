Subject: Secure No-overhead Online Order System for Publishers
Date: Wed, 13 Dec 1995 12:24:03 -0800 (PST)

A secure no-overhead online title-ordering system is now available. It may
be viewed in operation at the home page for Blue Water Publishing, a
publisher, software developer and distribution company, at 
http://www.bluewaterp.com/~bcrissey/
or from the online bookstore area of ISCNI, the Institute for the Study of
Contact with Non-Human Intelligence at
http://www.iscni.com

Blue Water's innovative online ordering system is called SimplySafe. It is
a needle-in-the-haystack approach to online security.  It requires no
encryption or secure servers, yet the probability that a dedicated hacker
scanning 100 internet messages a second will intercept a usable credit
card number sent via SimplySafe is less than the probability of picking
our Sun out of the Milky Way.  That is less than 1 in 200 billion.  Safe
enough for most folks.  There are easier ways for a hacker to pick up
credit card numbers than to waste time with SimplySafe transactions.  Try
it out!

SimplySafe currently supports secure online orders from Blue Water
Publishing, Wild Flower Press, Swan-Raven & Co., and ISCNI.
Direct inquiries to 
SimpleSafe@aol.com
