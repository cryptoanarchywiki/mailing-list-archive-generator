I am annoyed. Matt Blaze has no obligation to produce CFS for free, let
alone a version for dummies. And boy, are you a dummy. As someone who
has hacked away at CFS for a long time now on several platforms,
including linux, I can state that the issues of porting CFS to linux
were trivial and involved a one line sed on the rpcgen output. The more
recent versions of linux don't even require this.  Further, Matt is
hardly the government/corporate lacky that you suggest him to be. Why
don't you read some of his papers before you show your technical and
social ignorance? Get a life.
