[Re: regulating dossiers et. al.]

I'm sure that Phil Hallam-Baker has brought this up before, but there is 
a fair body of law on this subject internationaly. Probably the most 
restrictive is the UK Data Protection Act which regulates
 storage of personal information on computers (but not on paper). The 
DPA has a lot of holes, and seems to be honoured more in the breach than 
in the observance; other european countries have similar requirements. 

Of course, the UK has no FOIA, and won't until after the next election, 
so the most interesting databases aren't available.
