     You're invited to celebrate
     Laura and Bill's New Home
     Bill's Birthday
     and anything else you'd like to celebrate!
     Date:  Saturday, January 13
     Time:  5:00pm (or whenever)
     Putative location:  2040 Rock Ave. #22, Mountain View, CA
     RSVP (acceptances):  lstewart@prisminc.com, or Laura Stewart at work: 
     408-744-3359. 
      
     What to bring:  If you RSVP by Jan 12, don't bring anything!  We'll 
     provide something resembling dinner.  If you don't RSVP, bring food or 
     drink.  You are welcome to bring your family or other guests, but 
     please do not forward this invitation to other mail lists.  Smoking is 
     prohibited, laptop computers tolerated, board games warmly encouraged.
     
     How to get there (all directions are written as if 101 really went 
     north and south):
                          HOW TO FIND THE APARTMENT
     
     The address is 2040 W. Middlefield #22, but ignore that fact.  It is 
     much easier to find if you firmly believe that the address is 2040 
     Rock Ave. #22.  From the corner of Rock & Rengstorff, follow the big 
     lighted "2040" numbers along Rock.  Just after the second driveway on 
     Rock you will find a walkway into the complex...follow the walkway to 
     #19, then climb the stairs to #22.
     
                 HOW TO FIND THE CORNER OF ROCK & RENGSTORFF
     
     Cypherpunks:  From La Castena (the burrito place), just go one block 
     "west" on Rengstorff.
     
     From Highway 101 southbound:  Take Rengstorff exit, which makes a 
     180-degree loop.  Turn left onto Rengstorff westbound (away from the 
     bay, toward the ocean).   One block after Old Middlefield (and one 
     block before Middlefield), turn left on Rock Ave and park on Rock.  
     See above to find the apartment.
     
     From Highway 101 northbound:  Ignore the Middlefield exit.  Take 
     Rengstorff exit, which makes a 270-degree loop and merges onto 
     Rengstorff westbound (away from the bay, toward the ocean).   One 
     block after Old Middlefield (and one block before Middlefield), turn 
     left on Rock Ave. and park on Rock.  See above to find the apartment.
     
     From 680 at Dunbarton exit:  Taking the Dunbarton bridge to 101 is a 
     few minutes faster, but it's easy to get lost between the bridge and 
     101.  Unless you're familiar with the area, we recommend taking 680 to 
     237, west on 237 to 101, and north on 101 to the Rengstorff exit, 
     which makes a 270-degree loop and merges onto Rengstorff westbound 
     (away from the bay, toward the ocean).   One block after Old 
     Middlefield (and one block before Middlefield), turn left on Rock Ave. 
     and park on Rock.  See above to find the apartment.
     
     Further complications..er, clarifications:  Rock Ave. and Rock St. are 
     the same thing.  Middlefield Road and Old Middlefield Road are two 
     different things.

     Lost on the day of the party?  Call us at home: 415-938-1697.
     
     The price of condo living: There is no guest parking in the complex, 
     and the party must end by 10pm.  Please help us get along with our new 
     neighbors by respecting the condo rules.  Thanks!
