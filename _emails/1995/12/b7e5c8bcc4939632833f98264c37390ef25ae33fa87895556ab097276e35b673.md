you can't have it both ways. either anyone is free to decide what a 
cypherpunk is, and no one has the right to argue with it. or, cypherpunks
are something in particular, and someone has the authority to  determine
that.
............................................

So are you saying that "SHTBD!!!!"?  :>)

As you note, it is an informal system which operates on the list.  As you also 
note, an  "intelligent and mischievous adversary" can effectively create 
problems.  But you failed to note that intelligent and technically savvy 
members will find effective ways to deal with it.

That is what is important about an 'anarchic' list like this - that the 
challenge of maintaining rational discourse is met by the application of active 
intelligence, rather than all the rigmarole you mentioned.  And this is what 
makes it interesting, I think.  Any person's ideas or concepts or contributions 
can be tested or challenged by the more knowledgeable on the list, if they are 
so moved (or not, if they are not so moved).

The organizing subject around which discussions revolve is crypto, within the 
social context.  Because of this, the relationship to the main subject is 
difficult to maintain.  (And isn't this list like a microcosm, at times, of the 
larger social picture?) 

It is the unexpurgated exchanges of thought & expression, which regulate the 
list.
It reminds me of a book about life:   You Learn, or You Die. <g>
