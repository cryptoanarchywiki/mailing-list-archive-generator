Another "best way" is to make all calls that you want to be personal with
a cellular phone.  Most cellular systems don't send ANI and do not provide
any type of billing information to the phone company.  The number is also by
nature unlisted and the only way to get it is by you or the cellular 
carrier.  If the cellular carrier gives your number out without your
permision or a court order they are in BIG trouble..
