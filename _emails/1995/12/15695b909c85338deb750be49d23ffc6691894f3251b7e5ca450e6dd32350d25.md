But, what if one of the computers is connected on a "hostile" lan.
For example - your typical student PC running in a grad-student office
or on the network in the dorms.  Sniffing packets from it shouldn't be
too hard (yes, good ethernet concentrators make it harder - but not
impossible).  These packets will give you the necessary timing information.

What if that is a PC running Windoze or single-user Linux?  Then there
aren't likely to be fluctuating load averages.  The advesary is
close to the one end, and away you go......

Of course, targeting a server is much more pratical in terms of what
you may gain access to.  Several congested network hops will generate
lots of delays, BUT what about the 4:00am hit from the dialup terminal 
servers that happen to be on the same ethernet as the secure server.
This would be a normal situation for many ISPs.

All of that said - I think that this is more pratical in the "lab"
than on the net.  But, it is a very clever approach to the
problem of cracking a crypto system.  It serves us all a good example
that we need to leave NO stone unturned when examining a system.
