Photo IDs are easy to make for your employer, the law offices of Dewy,
Lye, and Howe.  Stick on laminate from an art supply store.  Good
thing to have.  Don't forget the SSN style employee id number.

Those forms they send to a post office?  They don't check for the real
address. MBE just needs 'proof' that its yours.  Again, your local
laser printer and an electricity bill do just fine.  They don't need
to keep the original; so the evidence is a bad photocopy.  The trick
is to make all this easy to accept & not make a fuss about the
information.  Meekly hand it over.
