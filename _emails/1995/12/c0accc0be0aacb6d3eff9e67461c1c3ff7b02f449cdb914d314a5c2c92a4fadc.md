Subject: ideath remailer temporarily down
Message-ID: <199512092345.AA05521@ideath.goldenbear.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----


The remailer located at remailer@ideath.goldenbear.com is currently 
unavailable because the local freenet (which handles DNS and MX service
for goldenbear.com) is making some configuration changes. Apologies for
not warning anyone, but I didn't get a warning either. 

Incoming mail for goldenbear.com should be spooling on sender's machines;
I haven't received any since late Thursday (12/7) evening. I don't know
when they'll get this fixed but I'm kinda pissed off about it and am 
exploring alternatives. Doh.

I'm reachable as gbroiles@darkwing.uoregon.edu as well.
