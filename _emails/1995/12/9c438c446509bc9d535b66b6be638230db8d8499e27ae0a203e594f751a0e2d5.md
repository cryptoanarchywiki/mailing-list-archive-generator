NTT Says Develops Secure Electronic Cash System

   
   
   TOKYO- Nippon Telegraph and Telephone said today that it has developed
   a secure electronic cash system which can be used for settling
   transactions on the Internet and in daily life using smart cards.
   
   "The system has very secure algorithms, and that makes fraudulent
   uses of the system very difficult," NTT researcher Mikio Suzuki
   told Reuters.
