C'punks,

Something of privacy interest happened to me yesterday.  I phoned
a company to ask for a copy of their catalog.  The phone clerk
asked for my last name and zip code.  After receiving that info,
the clerk asked me, "Is this your full name and address?" and
then gave them both correctly.  I was taken aback.

I have been at my new address for only a couple of months.  Prior
to that, I have been couch surfing for a year and a half.  Though
I called an 800 number, ANI had nothing to do with it since I was
calling from work.  It may have been from a database associated
with a credit reporting agency, a bank or a utility company, but
I am not aware of any of these being available on-line for 
something as mundane as requesting a consumer catalog.  The clerk 
had no idea where the info came from (or so he said).  Does 
anyone know how this trick was done?


 S a n d y

P.S.  If anyone is interested in helping to make an adult
      film, drop me a note.
