I must admit I don't quite get it, although I think there are people
who really can't distinguish between a person and a person's employer, and
who believe that the entire world is a black-and-white battle between
good and evil.

Jeff Weinstein got treated rudely back during the feeding frenzy
where everyone hated Netscape because he works for Netscape.

Brian Davis got treated rudely when he first joined the list because
he works for the government as a federal (?) prosecutor.

I get treated rudely from time to time because I work for AT&T.

It doesn't bother me, especially when it comes from an anonymous source who
for all we know might earn his or her keep by advertising the joys of
smoking cigarettes to small children or by testing the toxic effects of
new cosmetics on cute, furry animals.  I figure it all just comes with
the turf.  At least I don't get blood thrown on my by protestors the way
people who work in animal testing labs do...
