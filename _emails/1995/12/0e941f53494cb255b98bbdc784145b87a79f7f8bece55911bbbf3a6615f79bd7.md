    well, there goes the neighborhood.

    guess I better clean up my www front page which meets the Exon rules on 
indeceny, pisses on ITAR, and is probably seditious as well. might as 
well get a start on it before the eager beavers hemorrhage!

    the House contingent were all of the Exon persuasion to begin with and
subject to threats by the Christian Right. The real test is whether the
full House will sign on --a real test on Newt's professed 'Freedom of the
Net' policy!  If Newt keeps his resolve, can he again raise the 424-4
margin he had for the Wyden amendment?  Tune in for the exciting 
fireworks next week or so for House action....  yeah, right!

    and as a last resort, Clinto has vowed to veto the bill for two 
reasons: the open season privileges for big business to consolidate all 
telecommonications into a few empires, and the lack of regulation to 
control same.  Maybe now that Hillary is not out front, maybe Bill will 
find his balls, or maybe he will waffle again....
