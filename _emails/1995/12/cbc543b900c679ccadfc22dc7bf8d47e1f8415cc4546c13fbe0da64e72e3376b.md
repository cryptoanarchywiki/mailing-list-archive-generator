It's the former (in SSL v2.0).

I looked into this, because the former version can be vulnerable to
related-key attacks, if not done right.  SSL v2.0 does it right.
(In particular, SSL v2.0 hashes both the 88 bit salt + 40 bit secret
to get all the cipher keys.)

(And you'd have to change the cipher type from RC4-40 to RC4-128.)

Or write a local proxy to convert from RC4-40-salted to RC4-128.
