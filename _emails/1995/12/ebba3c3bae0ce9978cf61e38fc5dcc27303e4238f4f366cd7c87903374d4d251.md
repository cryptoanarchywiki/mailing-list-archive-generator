The Administration sent a letter to the FCC asking that they move forward
on the Apple and WinForum petitions.

The Administration's reasons for supporting the allocation are given
below.  The full filing is on the NTIA server at http://www.ntia.doc.gov


>>
>>
>>                                    November 2, 1995
>>
>> The Honorable Reed Hundt
>> Chairman
>> Federal Communications Commission
>> 1919 M Street, N.W.
>> Washington, D.C.  20554
>>
>>      Re:  RM 8648, RM 8653
>>
>> Dear Chairman Hundt:
>>
>>      This letter addresses the petitions for rulemaking filed
>> before the Commission in May 1995 by the Wireless Information
>> Networks Forum (WINForum) and Apple Computer Company, Inc.[1]
>> Those petitions request the allocation of certain spectrum in the
>> 5 GHz band and the adoption of service rules for shared
>> nonlicensed personal radio network devices.  Both the WINForum
>> Shared Unlicensed Personal Radio Network (SUPERnet) devices and
>> the Apple National Information Infrastructure (NII) Band devices
>> would allow operation of nonlicensed, high-speed, wireless
>> networks with multimedia capabilities.  NTIA believes that these
>> new wireless technologies have the potential to enhance education
>> and other community services.  Implementation of these networks
>> and the feasibility of spectrum sharing between the proposed
>> devices and Federal users should thus be fully explored by the
>> Commission.  We therefore recommend that the Commission proceed
>> with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) so that the policy
>> and technical issues raised by the petitions may be addressed.
>>
>>      NTIA serves as the principal adviser to the President on
>> telecommunications and information issues, including the
>> Administration's NII and Global Information Infrastructure
>> initiatives.  In addition, as Federal spectrum manager, NTIA
>> shares with the Commission jurisdiction over the frequency bands
>> under discussion in the petitions.  NTIA believes that the
>> proposed WINForum and Apple devices could provide an important
>> means of nonlicensed wireless access to the NII.  Wireless
>> networks can be more affordable than wired networks.  Schools,
>> hospitals, businesses, and others would thus have convenient
>> access to communications networks with voice, video, data, and
>> graphics capabilities without the expense and disruption that
>> installing wired systems would require.
>>
>>      As you know, the President and Vice President have launched
>> an important initiative to connect all of our classrooms,
>> libraries, hospitals, and clinics to the NII by the year 2000.
>> This initiative, which promotes expanded access to computers,
>> teacher training, and the development of compelling educational
>> applications, has the potential to revolutionize our educational
>> system, changing the way teachers teach and students learn.
>> Students will be able to collaborate with their peers around the
>> world, search digital libraries, use remote scientific
>> instruments, and take "field trips" to on-line museums.  As
>> President Clinton said in a recent speech, "[e]very child in
>> America deserves the chance to get the high-tech know-how to
>> unlock the promises of the 21st Century."
>>
>>      For this reason, the Administration strongly supports
>> spectrum policies that will promote affordable, high-bandwidth
>> wireless computer networks.  Wireless networks, and nonlicensed
>> networks in particular, can be a cost-effective approach for the
>> countless schools in our Nation that need connections to the NII
>> to enhance learning opportunities and provide young Americans
>> with the skills they will need in the future.  Wireless networks
>> may be an important option for schools because they often face
>> limited budgets and are prevented from entering the Information
>> Age by inadequate wiring.  Furthermore, the proposed devices
>> could allow more students to have network access directly at
>> their desks in their classrooms instead of in computer labs in
>> other rooms.
>>
>>      Other users will benefit from nonlicensed wireless networks
>> as well.  Small businesses that lack adequate wiring and that
>> cannot afford access to wired networks could have affordable,
>> convenient wireless access to multimedia networks.  Such access
>> could enhance productivity and efficiency.  Health care providers
>> would have the ability to transmit patient data, such as x-rays
>> and MRI images, video recordings, medical charts, and other
>> records, which would dramatically improve the efficiency of
>> medical staff and ease the group diagnosis of medical cases.
>> Moreover, NTIA believes nonlicensed wireless components of the
>> NII will provide significant opportunities for innovators and
>> small companies to make contributions to the overall mix of
>> products and services available through the NII.[2]
