On the positive side, I've heard some commentators (mainly on CNBC, and
all-business news channel) ask pointed questions, and note that if every
country imposes its own standards on the Internet/Usenet, then the
implications are dire.

The strong reaction developing against Compuserve could rebound to the
benefit of killing off the Exon/Hyde language, in the best of all
situations. (The Telecom Bill is still being thrashed out, and the CS
controversy may remind folks of the implications of their actions.)

I predict Compuserve will lose so much of what little respect they have
eked out amongst Internet users that they will be eventually forced to
provide the 200 dropped newsgroups, issue an apology, and probably retire
or reassign a few executives as a show of public remorse. You heard it hear
first.

And many users are seeing the problems with monolithic, primitive ISPs like
Compuserve, AOL, Prodigy, etc., and are moving to get "real" Net
connections. This is a Good Thing.

(define CompuserveSucks (lambda () (display ".") (CompuserveSucks)))
(CompuserveSucks)


Recurses, foiled again!
