In case anyone's worried about the short-term implications, you'll all have
plenty of time before enforcement starts. The conference committee has to
OK the final form, voting, etc., then the Prez has to sign it (or pocket
veto it, which is unlikely in the extreme). I'm no longer current on
schedules as I was in high school civics class, but I think it will take
effect some weeks or months after being signed into law.

And even then I think prosecutions will take a while to get rolling, as
cases are considered. It's not as if overnight the cops will be raiding
sites.
