I assume that the "Problem" is that by only giving each corespondent ONE
E-Stamp, you are single streaming your connections with them (ie: Are
talking Half-Duplex). Not only are they restricted to one message
"in-flight" but they can not start another message until they have done a
capture run to acquire your ACK and get the new key.
