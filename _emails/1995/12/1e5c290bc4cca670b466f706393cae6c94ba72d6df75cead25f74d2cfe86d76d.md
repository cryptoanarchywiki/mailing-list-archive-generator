As usual, I speak at most for myself. But I think it's pretty safe to say
that most people here believe the privacy interests of individuals (and
companies) outweigh the allegedly conflicting "national security" interests
of the countries in which we reside. A great deal has been written (more
eloquently) on this point. The NSA doubtless believes it has a "national
security" interest in knowing the contents of my communications with my very
good friend in the USAF. I strenuously disagree. This is one of the reasons
I devote so much of my time to, er, cypherpunking :)

(It has also been noted by many before me that preserving the privacy of U.S.
entities is a significant national security interest in and of itself.)
