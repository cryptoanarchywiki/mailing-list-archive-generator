1) I have no faith in my number being unlisted, I merely 
   mentioned my contractural expectation.

2) I was not griping.  I was requesting information (of which
   "Anonymous" is apparently bereft).

3) Being "taken aback" refers to surprise (look it up).  Far
   from the meaning of "cognitive dissonance."

"Assuming facts not in evidence," in the lingo.

So what DO you know, "Anonyomous"?
