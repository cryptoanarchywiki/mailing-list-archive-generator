But you can already sell it short. (I.e., you sell shares of Netscape now
for future delivery, hoping that before the time you must deliver them, the
price will go down and you'll be able to buy the shares to cover the sale
at a lower price than you sold them for.)

Someone I know sold a bunch of Netscape short about the time the various
cracks were announced on this mailing list.  Unfortunately for him, the
price didn't go down.
