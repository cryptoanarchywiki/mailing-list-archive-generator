While this may be a reasonably good start, what I would have preferred that
you say is that if any kind of GAK system is adopted, either foreign or
domestic, you as a corporation would ENTHUSIASTICALLY do everything in your
power to  (_legally_) circumvent, undermine, sabotage, neutralize, and
counteract whatever goals the US government has with reqard to implementing
GAK. In other words, while you might stay barely within the letter of the
law, you would tirelessly exploit every possible loophole (both legal and
technical) to ensure that the government NEVER gets its way.  

I feel certain that with a few imaginative lawyers and programmers (both
foreign and domestic), it should be possible to turn this into a "nightmare
scenario" for the government.
