That's not giving technical data to the foreigner, that's providing a service;
the ITAR doesn't seem to restrict that.  It's not an especially secure way to
operate, but that's an inherent problem with multi-user systems or file servers.
One way to implement it that would be only mildly insecure would be to put PGP
on a file server, with execute-only permissions; users of client machines
still could be attacked by somebody faking out NFS, but they wouldn't have
to send their passphrases across the net the way they would in a telnet session.
