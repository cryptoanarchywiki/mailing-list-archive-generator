It could be even worse.  I was on a panel last year with Scott Charney (sp?)
(I believe from DoJ) during which he commented that if you give your secret
key to anyone -- e.g., your own company -- then you have given up the
presumption of privacy.  That leaves the police open to get that secret
without a warrant.  This claim should be checked by a real lawyer.
