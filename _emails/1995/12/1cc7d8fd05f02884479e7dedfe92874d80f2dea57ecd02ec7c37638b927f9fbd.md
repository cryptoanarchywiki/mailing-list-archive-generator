There is a commercial product out there from Gimpel Software called _The C
Shroud_. It removes all structure from the code, replacing it with gotos,
renames all the symbols to axxxxxxx, converts constants and strings to hex,
substitutes all #defines and expands all macros, strips all formatting and
comments, etc., resulting in a perfectly compilable, but infuriatingly
obfuscated set of source files.
