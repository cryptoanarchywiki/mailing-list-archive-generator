My understanding was that, for example, a convicted felon in posession
of a handgun where handguns must be registered could be charged with
being a convicted felon in posession of a firearm.  He could NOT be
charged with posession of an unregistered handgun, because requiring
him to register, when it is illegal for him to posess, is a violation
of his first amendment rights.
