AFAIK, Clipper and most of the other systems had escrow agents oblivious to
the identity of the subject of the warrant.  I have seen *no* system which
allows an escrow agent to know it's not being duped by the feds and I
believe I know how to prove that that's not possible.

If you see any such system, please let me know.

BTW, there was Silvio Micali's design which allowed the escrow agents to
verify that they were given the right private key shares without anyone
learning the private key in the process.  That's the only oblivious
mechanism I recall in this business.
