I agree with all of Tim's sentiments (well, in this message, anyway :>).  I'd
especially like to thank Jeff Weinstein for his hard work keeping both us
and Netscape management informed.  I think he's done us both a great service.

To avoid just saying "me too", I'll throw out another idea on making the U.S.
version of Netscape available to U.S. users over the Internet.  How about a
phone number to call to get an access id of some sort that can be used to
FTP the software.  When you call the number, you can use caller-id to verify
that the person is calling from within the U.S.  You could set up a BBS-type
system to do this automatically, or make the phone number a 900 number and
charge a few dollars to cover your costs.  You could also set up the access
id so that it can only be used once.
