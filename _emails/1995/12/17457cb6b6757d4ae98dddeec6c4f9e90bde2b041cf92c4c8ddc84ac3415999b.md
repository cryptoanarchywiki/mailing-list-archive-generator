The two "errors" in the sentence are:

1) The use of the future tense.  There are a host of encryption products
available today that are very strong.  Unless you were talking about ease of
use.  Newt Gingrich -- in a similar statement -- was speaking generally
rather than about children and that's where I noticed the error before.  It
is a present not a future capability.

2)  And no government on earth will find easy to decipher is an
understatement.  As I'm sure you know, properly deployed modern cryptography
(or even the 100-year-old technology of one-time-pads) is mathematically
infeasible to break.  Though of course attacks other decryption remain possible.

Both of these are really quibbles rather than substantial criticisms.
