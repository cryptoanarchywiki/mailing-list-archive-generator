Not to belittle something that is the obvious result of painstaking work;
but I think the timeline FAQ can be improved in two general ways:

(1)  More of the specific events should be specifically dated; and

(2)  I think it would be appropriate to include a version history of PGP.  
Among other things, I think it appropriate to note the distinction between
PRZ's own Bass-o-matic conventional encryption in the earliest versions and
the use of IDEA in later versions.

These comments aside, you've done an excellent job, and the facts you present
jibe well with my own understanding.
