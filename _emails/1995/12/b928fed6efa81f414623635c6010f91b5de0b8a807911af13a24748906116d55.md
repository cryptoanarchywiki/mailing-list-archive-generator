One should also notice that Bavaria is only one state in the German
Federal Republic; this case is more like Texas investigating
Compuserve than the United States federal government investigating
Compuserve.  Bavaria is the stronghold of what can properly be called
the (Catholic) Religious Right in Germany.  It should also be noticed
that in general German publications and television seem to be less
constrained in publishing materials that in the United States would be
called ``indecent'' by some than are United States publications and 
broadcasters.
