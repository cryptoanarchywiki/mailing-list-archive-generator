      Nice point, though I too doubt that's the reason: if *every* agent
needed to be cleared, then this clearance stipulation would serve nicely,
but if only *one* at every escrow agency needs to be cleared...

      Organizations like SAIC seem like "naturals" for GAK escrow agents
-- and they're a forgone conclusion as far as spookery is concerned. What
troubles me is the suggestion that *every* agent *must* hire someone who
might answer to a higher authority, as it were. And what troubles me more
is watching this paragovernment's transparent efforts to reproduce itself
step by step, always trying to elude efforts to make it accountable or
subordinate to civil authorities.

>But most GAK accesses would be handled through normal channels, albeit secret.

      Of course. But most cops and prosecutors haven't developed the
"national security" verbal tic. Yet.

      GAK stinks, but this security-clearance stipulation *really* stinks.
      Of course, I'm preaching to the choir...
