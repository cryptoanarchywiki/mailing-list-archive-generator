Greetings all. May I also point out that the power of self government is at
least as effective when rewarding good behavior as when punishing bad. You
guys are the experts in this particular political niche, but from the
viewpoint of a more or less innocent stander-by, the statement sounded to me
like "OK, we went, we listened, they were full of shit, the line is HERE."
and I'm quite satisfied.
