I remember the first computer I built had a neat wireless "sound
card" built in. The radio waves generated by the processor could
be modified by choosing the instructions executed. So you could
get sound for your computer games by putting a radion next to
the machine! The delay loops for the games contained multiple
paths for different sounds. It was actually pretty good for the
time.

This leads me to believe that a delay loop might not be good
enough. The leakage from the smart card could be enough to
identify when the card entered the delay loop. The difference
between the signal could be significant.

Just a thought.
