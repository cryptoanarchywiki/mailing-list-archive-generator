How, exactly, does Perry (or anyone else here) "know" it to be a 
falsehood.  Fred denies it.  If I was posting anonymously and was accused 
of being the anonymous poster, I'd deny it too.

Oh, I forgot, someone posting as one of the "Alices" denied it too.  That 
makes it conclusive. 

This anonymity thing is easier than I thought.

Not a lawyer on the Net, although I play one in real life.
