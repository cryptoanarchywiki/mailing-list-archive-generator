And the answer, if you believe what they say, is in a series of 
PowerPoint presentations and speech transcripts on Microsoft's Web
server.

  http://www.microsoft.com/internet/

I found Bill Gates' presentation rather amusing because he uses the term
"broadband" to mean "high bandwidth." He seems to have gotten confused
because ATM is supposed to be both. 

The bit on server tools says Microsoft plans to do everything. Doesn't 
look like they've really decided on anything.

Microsoft Internet Explorer will become the browser choice for everyone.

Microsoft Network will ensure that its content is fully accessible to any 
browser.

Microsoft's strategy is to support VB.

Microsoft's strategy is to support Java.

Microsoft's strategy is to support Blackbird.

Microsoft's strategy is to support HTML and VRML.

Microsoft supports Internet and Windows Standards (the latter are not 
defined).

The pictures were pretty, though, especially in the Maritz piece. (Which
was actually prepared by Bill Conte... how convenient that MS Office 
saves the author's name and other summary information by default.)
