And I'm saying that your proposal does NOT comply with the letter of the
law. There's no point in arguing this, as the facts are clear. Consult the
ITARs and the previous discussions here and elsewhere on the practice of
leaving "hooks" that crypto modules can later be attached to.

No, the USG has not (yet at least) prohibited export of blank programs or
disks. The "no hooks" rule has some ambiguities, but is by no means quite
this dumb.

All I'm saying is that you need to look at what the laws are, and how they
have affected existing products and companies, before announcing a
"solution."
