The problem with the private investigation is that law enforcement may 
not believe you were an "innocent" citizen conducting an investigation.  
Remember the ABSCAM Congressman who contended he was conducting his own 
investigation ...

Escrowing what you intend to do could be seen as blackmail ammunition if 
the Congressman fails to produce.

Unfortunately for the Cryptoanarchists (tm -- in more ways than one), 
absent law enforcement running the "sting" you are taking a risk of being 
stung yourself.
