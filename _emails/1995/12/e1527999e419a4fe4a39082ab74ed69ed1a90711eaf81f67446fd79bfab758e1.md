This is pretty weak w.r.t. GAK ("rights to privacy are placed in question by
the current [...] proposal"). Most of the position statement really 
addresses the key length limit. But as far as I'm concerned, it falls clearly
on the anti-GAK side of the line. 

(The phrasing "the mandatory nature of the proposal resulting from the
key escrow requirement itself" is a bit ambiguous. I'm taking it to refer to
the mandatory nature of Clipper etc.)
