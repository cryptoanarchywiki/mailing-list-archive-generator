Just a personal note... while I am strongly in favour of security, this
seems rather petulant and knee-jerkish.

JeffW: Please add a configuration option to let users override the "Mozilla"
ident, so that they can continue to use Netscape at all sites.  I personally
won't use the override, though; if a site is going to insist on trying to
frivolously exlude me as a user based on nothing but the browser I choose to
use, they aren't serious anyway.

>(the guy is ticked off at them trying to establish their own standards) -

The _market_ establishes standards (been proven time and time again).  His
reaction sounds pretty childish to me, but YMMV...
