At last some good news from the Hill.  The House Judiciary Committee has
announced that they are unable to vote on Chukie Schumer's Antiterrorism
bill at this time.  It is "dead for now."  That means that the $500 million
for the telecoms companies to carry out the Digital telphony Initiative is
also dead for now.

Thanks to an heroic coalition of leftist civil liberties types and right
wing nuts (including the Fundies) for squashing it for now.  

Now if we could only convince the Fundies that the Klinton Admin was going
to use the Exxon amendment to outlaw religious speech on the nets on the
grounds of political indecency.  But maybe the Telecoms bill will die too.
It did last time.
