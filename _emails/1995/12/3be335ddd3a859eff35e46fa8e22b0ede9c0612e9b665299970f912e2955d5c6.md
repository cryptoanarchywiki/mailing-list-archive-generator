      If I were worth billions, if I were the sparkle on the high-tech
bubble, if I had a Major hand in engineering crucial protocols, if my
company were so young that it hadn't yet had time to bog down in business
as usual, I think I probably would. That's a lot of Big talk and a lot of
Ifs, ain't it? But that's how it goes: I doubt he -- or anyone else --
would give as much to my LDF as I gave to his (chump change, but more than
I could afford).
      Clark should ask himself what Rabbi Akiva put best: 

      If not me, who?
      If not now, when?

      I do my small part, in my small way; he can do his big part, in his
big way. One thing scares the spooks more than what they oppose:
publicity.
