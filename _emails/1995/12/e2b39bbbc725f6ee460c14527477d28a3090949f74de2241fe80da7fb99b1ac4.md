I personally believe that this topic does not deserve the heat that it
has generated on this list. This opinion could change. I'll have a much
better idea Tuesday evening when I've had a chance to hear the latest from
NIST on GAK for export.

Much of the complaining in September was that vendors didn't want
to build two versions, one domestic and one for "export"
Netscape is currently doing at least two, and probably closer to
ten if you count Windows 16, 32, Mac, Motif, etc.

Except for Louis Freeh and Dorrthy Denning, I haven't heard real people
support GAK domestically, although Geoff Grevildinger's pitch at the Sept
NIST meeting was 99 & 44/100% domestic. I'll be listening pretty
carefully this Tuesday.

I think we need to save out fury for real statements about making
non-GAK illegal for domestic use. If this starts to condense out
of the Ether, I expect that the civil liberties lobbies will
get real loud. the ACLU and VTW were both vocal at the September
meeting, and EPIC was there, along with folks like Proffessor Hoffman of
GW.

I have no problem with Netscape having a GAK-ified browser in addition
to a real one. At least as long as the GAK'd version is clearly identified
-- a logo saying "big brother inside" covering 25% of the screen should
do it for me.

Netscape is currently doing two (or ten) version. This simple
fact seems to have been lost by most of the posters in the
past few days.

If the issue is just that people don't like the idea that the free,
downloadable is GAK'd and that they have to pay $50 for a browser
with strong crypto, please take your whining off list. Or find
one you like (Netmanage's is too buggy for me, but Mosaic version 2 is
quite usable, as is Microsoft's, IMHO)

The "criteria" (see my http://www.isse.gmu.edu/~pfarrell/nistmeeting.html
page) clearly say that approved systems can _not_ interoperate
with unapproved systems. This means that exportable systems can not
interoperate with, say, PGP.

There was talk about having multinational treaties so the French, Iranian,
and other "friends" could access the GAK's messages, but that was
recognized as being many years out. Diplomacy is slow.

It was quite clear from multinational vendors that they thought
that non-US corporations would _absolutely not_ accept
GAK in the US.

The main effect of this stupid export stuff is to drive
crypto development offshore.

It was quite clearly implied at the September meetings that the
Government expected that vendors would do only one version, GAK'd.
This would allow the LEAs to tromple all over US civil liberties
at will.

I've been developing software too long to accept that the increases
in product support costs will be "slight". But I agree that
Netscape should _continue_ to have three separate versions, one for
domestic use, a second one for export from the US, and the third  with
Fortessa for sale to Govie agancies that want it.  They probably need to
add a fourth version, a strong foreign version developed offshore.

Tim's suggestion of a formal statement that separates domestic product
from export, and clearly leaves GAK out of US products, is a very good one.
It is close to what Netscape is doing now, it is completely consistant
with current and publically announced policies, and it would
let this list return to discussions that are relevant to
cryptography.
