Well lets put it this way, people have hacked machines through firewalls
via IP spoofing, broken a single SSL RC4-40 bit session after weeks of CPU
time, are you saying that perhaps being able to break a fixed
Diffie-Hellman key on a central router/computer would not be worth trying. 
Remember, if you broke this key, and had recorded the last 6 months worth
of traffic, you can now decode all of this traffic.  Once you have that
secret key and those packet logs, the decoding is a trivial and mechanical
process (trust me on this one).  One of the major advantages of choosing a
new secret key per HD negotiation is that you loose this capacity to
decrypt previous and future sessions. When we talk about taking 100s of
years to factor large primes, a system that may work after a month or 2 of
collecting data and statistics is definatly an easier proposition,
especially when the reward is all past and future traffic.
