        There is a company called Optoelectronics that markets a radio reciever 
         called the Interceptor.  This is a broad band (several hundred MHz) 
         device designed to lock on to the most powerful signal around,
         regardless of frequency.  As supplied, it only has a rubber duck 
         antenna, but a broadband, directional antenna (Log Periodic?) could be 
         attached.  There are AM and FM versions that output audio and a version
         called the Scout that controls a scanner.  These could have outboard 
         devices hung on to them to decode digital signals, record the 
         conversation ... all for less than $1000.
