"Gee, I dunno, that sounds like a lot of work, and well, I'm making good 
dough.  Sure, it would be a boon for the company, and fit right in with 
the mainstream perception that government way too involved in Joe 
Random's life, and win or lose, either way it would be a major public 
relations coup, and would restore the confidence of many foreign 
customers concerned about U.S. economic intelligence goals, but well... it 
just sounds so... subversive.

Honey, could you pass the jam?"
