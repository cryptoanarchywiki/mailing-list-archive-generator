Agreed completely, if you add:

"....unless the person claiming to be Bryce is someone who managed to
steal secret keys from that same Bryce."

Without this clause, it seems to me you're assuming that secret keys (or
other identity-verifying tokens) can't ever be stolen.  Insofar as you
use multiple things (cryptography, IP address, etc.) to identify
someone, you can make it harder to impersonate someone, but each of
these things is ultimately forge-able.  -- NB
