Uh, every PRA (public records act) in the nation hase extensive exceptions
-- for school records, collective bargaining, various investigative
records, etc.

NO state PRA or federal FOIA declares blanket access to all public-agency
records -- often justifiably; sometimes for agency arse-covering.
