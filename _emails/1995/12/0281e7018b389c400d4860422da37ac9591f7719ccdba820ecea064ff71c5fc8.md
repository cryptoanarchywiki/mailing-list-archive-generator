To make this work, the government would need to prohibit individuals
from campaigning for politicians, taking out ads with political 
consequences, and so on and so forth.   A short step from 
totalitarianism

A better solution is to move assets and money into forms where
politicians cannot get at them, thus reducing the power of politicians,
and thus the incentive to buy favors from them.
