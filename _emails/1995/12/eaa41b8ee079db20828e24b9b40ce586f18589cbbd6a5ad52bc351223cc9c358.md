Do you have a reference to Dobbertin's paper?

Schneier's discussion of MD4 says that DeBoor and Bosselaers cryptanalyzed
the last two of the three rounds of MD4 in 1991, Merkle did the first two,
and Biham discussed a differential attack on the first two, but nobody
had done the whole thing.  Does Dobbertin's attack take one of these
and use it to feed an otherwise-brute-force search?
