The best way to secure the endpoints of communication is to use a sector level
encryption TSR like SecureDrive.  In a program like this, when a file is
opened for reading or writing, the TSR automatically en/decrypts the data
before it is processed by the calling application.  Aside from a slightly
slower disk access rate, a program like this is not inconvenient to use at all.
SecureDrive is available at ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/
filesystems/secdr13c.zip.
