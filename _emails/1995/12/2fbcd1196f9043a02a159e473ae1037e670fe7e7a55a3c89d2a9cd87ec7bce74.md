Firstly - and don't take this personally - how much computer
knowledge do you have?  The PGP sources use all sorts of
#ifdefs and other kludges.  A fair amount of C coding
ability is needed to get the damn things to do much of
anything.  (Hell, I can't read most of it - my precompiled
MSDOS version does what I need it to do.)

If you make PGP more user friendly... well, PGP 3.0 is still
coming Real Soon Now (TM) and it will include an API that
will make hooking into it ridiculously simple.  Beyond that,
there are already a number of good DOS and Windows shells
for it, and nobody on unix-flavoured systems expects a clean
user interface anyway :)  (Well, except for XWindows...)
But, if you write it - and I'm cautioning you to be sure
you don't reinvent the wheel - you can distribute it freely.
I suggest using the terms of the GNU GPL.

And the key values - well, you can give it 32k bits, but 1.
generating a key pair could take a prohibitively long time;
2. nobody else can use it (the default PGP distributions
are capped off at 2047 bits).

Good luck.
Dave
