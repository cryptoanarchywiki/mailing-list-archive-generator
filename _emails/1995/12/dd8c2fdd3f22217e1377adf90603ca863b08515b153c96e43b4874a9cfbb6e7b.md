Not _nearly_ as hard as breaking/finding an appropriately encrypted key.

I for one am not going to even bother with the penet address unless the
posts come from there. After all, it's a forgery anyway. The real Alice
already posted a PGP key. I wouldn't be reading this list if I were
going to fall over for a simple impersonation.

Of course, if our impersonating, trusts-penet-not-PGP-coworkers-think-
of-everything-but-a-packet-sniffer Alice were to post from penet,
then everyone (including procmail ;) would have to believe his claims
of pseudo-identity.

I must say, L.D. is really falling all over himself this time. Maybe
he's just trying to make people *think* he's a cryptobungler, so that he
can keep his other tentacles with whom he converses out of suspicion.

Wishing Emacs had IMAP support cuz here comes mailcrypt
