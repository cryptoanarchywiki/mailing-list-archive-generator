Re: NOISE.SYS Random Sampling Device Driver for DOS (v0.2-Beta):

I've finally gotten a usable version of NOISE.SYS written.  The beta
is ready for semi-public release and review.  If you're interested in
testing it or examing the code, email me at <wlkngowl@unix.asb.com>

It's only a prototype version.  I do not know any strong methods of
testing random data.  If anyone is willing to help on that part or
point me in the right direction, it would be appreciated...

What this driver does:

When loaded, it hooks onto the keyboard interrupt (0x09) and collected
fast timings between keystrokes.  It can also be easily configured at
compilation to sample other interrupts, as well as collect "seedling"
keystrokes upon initialization.

It sets up a character device called RANDOM, that when polled takes
the earliest collected bytes from the random pool (size can be adjusted),
combines them with a count-word based on the number of samples collected
plus the number of times the driver has fetched data from the pool,
transforms it using the Secure Hash algorithm, and outputs the bits from
the hash.

It's only a prototype: this version doesn't check to see if the pool is
"empty" at the moment.

Features: written in 386 assembler, takes under 2k of memory and can be
loaded from the command line using a utility like DEVLOD.  Also under
GPL, so you've got the source-code to play with.

Comments and criticism from crypto-gurus would be greatly appreciated.
Reply if you'd like me to send a copy.  (Important Q: is this software
covered under ITAR?!?)
