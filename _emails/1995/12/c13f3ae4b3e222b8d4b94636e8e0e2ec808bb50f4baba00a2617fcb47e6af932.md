"A day that will live in infamy."

Anyone have the exact time that Bill will begin speaking? I think it 
would be "neat" if we timed the release of a complete rewrite of the 
win95netbugs FAQ (with a new security section), improvements to the 
hackmsoft page, and other stuff for 15 minutes after Bill begins.

The win95netbugs FAQ, version 4.00.950, will be posted to the following
places tomorrow morning (I'll probably be up all night): 

http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~llurch/win95netbugs/faq.html
  [canon URL; multiple load-balancing SPARCServers]

http://www-dccs.stanford.edu/NetConsult/Win95Net/faq.html
  [use this if you have an old Sun DNS server that barfs on the 
   www-leland lbnamed tricks]

news.answers, comp.answers, comp.protocols.tcp-ip.ibmpc, and several
higher-traffic groups (this will be the first approved and rtfm-archived
posting; the news-answers folks got back to me last week). I'll probably
create the throwaway w95netbugs@aol.com for posting purposes. 

gopher://quixote.stanford.edu/1m/win95netbugs

An email autoresponder to be named later (finger this account in the 
morning).

An ezine or three to be named later.
