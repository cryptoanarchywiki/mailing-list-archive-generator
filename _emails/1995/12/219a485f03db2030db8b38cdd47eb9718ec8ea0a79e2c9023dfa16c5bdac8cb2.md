: 
: I don't see how you can charge for a commercial versions of ApacheSSL. 
: Isn't it protected by the GNU license agreement? Or is the idea that by

	Go read the GNU license.  Nothing prevents selling the programs, 
nothing prevents selling modifications of the programs.  The major 
restraint is that you have to provide source.  Now, from what I read of 
the page, that is being done.

	Personally, I would prefer to see the whole thing given away, and if I
had done it, it would be.  But he (or his contractors / employees ) did
the work that went into modifying it, and if he want's to sell that
work he bloody well can.

Does history recorde any case in which the majority was right?
