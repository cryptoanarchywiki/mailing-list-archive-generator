I was told today that students at Oklahoma University have their computer
accounts subject to administrative inspection and that encryption (even
email) without escrow is prohibited. Maybe the story is not quite straight
but federal law supposedly protects personal electronic communication and
I somehow don't think OU can overide this simply because it passes thru
their computers. 

Sounds like another job for PGP.
