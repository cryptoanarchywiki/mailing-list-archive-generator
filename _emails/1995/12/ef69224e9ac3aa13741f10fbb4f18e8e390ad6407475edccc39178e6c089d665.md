Most cellular systems still write billing tapes and send them to a clearing
house for proccessing.  It may take 2 or 3 days before a bill is updated.
Thats not including that it takes sometimes up to a month before your
roaming charges are recorded from all of the other cellular carriers.  Some
carriers have realtime billing but it still doesn't take into account roaming.

This obligation is uncurred mostly by the fact that cellular carriers HATE
to loose customers.  If refunding a few min. of air-time helps keep a
customer then they will.  Unlike the phone company, a threat to discontinue
service with a cellular carrier works well in getting your way.
