> What would make a University less secure than a corporation??

Ostensibly, universities in the interest of academic freedom and 
promoting learning usually don't have nearly the same draconian measures 
that corporations have.  They don't have to worry nearly as much about 
trade secrets being mailed out he front door, or information warfare 
attacks in which a competitor is attempting to penetrate the system.

And those theoreticians sit behind their desks and keep scribbling on 
their pads.  There's not much going on the ground with theory.  Plus, if 
you knew anything about theory, a lot of theory has very little immediate 
practical importance...complexity theory is good to make sure that 
one-way functions actually do exist, but in progress, there's not much 
way to implement it.
