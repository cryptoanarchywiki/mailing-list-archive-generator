  Was he able to name any companies that would not buy products without
the "US Government seal of approval"?  It seems kind of odd that he is
slamming Netscape for having had a weak implementation when he would love
to force everyone to have a "weak implementation".  I'm sure that he will
be happy to know that we have fixed these weaknesses.  :-)

  Agreed.

  I assume you are talking about the exact text of the statement that
our representative made at the meeting.  I will try to get it, but it
may take a day or two since they will be in DC until at least tomorrow.
