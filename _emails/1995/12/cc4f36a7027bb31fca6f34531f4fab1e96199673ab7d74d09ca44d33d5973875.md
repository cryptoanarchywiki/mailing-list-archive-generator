If he has not clarified his position by tomorrow evening, I will set up some
web pages explaining the situation and decrying Netscape's apparent
position on key escrow (GAK). I have the quotes that L. McCarthy posted,
and Jeff Weinstein's response. I have not been able to get the article off
the server yet (possible all the cypherpunks downloading it?). Any other
documents I should include?
---------
	I would suggest being sure to include some links to the EFF archives
in regards to Clipper, etcetera. These should make it clear that it isn't just
one group opposing the idea of GAK, but a wide coalition.
