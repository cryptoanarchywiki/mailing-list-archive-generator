How is this different for an ecash program vs. a First Virtual email
acknowledgement program, where either a (really hairy) virus, or, 
more practically, an active email interloper could fake FV acks?  

While hardware may be the best encryption solution for the average user
(as you say, and I think I agree with you), it needs to have some password
interface such as a small keypad on the front of the smartcard, to prevent
its usability after theft.

Of course, there are problems with digicash as well; my Digicash play-money
account thinks it's empty (in spite of having half a dozen coin-looking files),
and doesn't recognize any of the half-dozen passwords I've guessed I might have
used with it, so I'm not able to use Sameer's digicash-powered remailer.
