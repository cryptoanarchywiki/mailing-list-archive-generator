I am forced to wonder whether the people who type in stories like this
are conscious while they do so.  Replace "the technology" with
"pistols" in the above paragraph; it doesn't make any sense unless you
assume there are no organized crime or terrorist organizations in the
US, or that such organizations can only acquire things that pass
through national borders.  Are news editors so technophobic that they
assume there must be something they just "don't get"?


On a vaguely related note, I saw a quick preview for an episode of
"The Client".  The episode was supposed to be about Internet child
molesters (who I suppose are the ones that know the secret
"meta-alt-ctrl" sequence that causes the innocent victims on the other
end of the wire to be abused via modem).  Anybody see it?
