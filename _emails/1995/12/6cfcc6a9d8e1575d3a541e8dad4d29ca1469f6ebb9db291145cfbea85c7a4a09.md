Your mailbox has exceeded the soft size limit of 8MB.  Mail will continue to be
delivered to your mailbox until it reaches the hard size limit of 15MB.  please
removed unecessary messages from you mailbox.

Additionally, if you're using CompuServe/Spry AirMail you may choose the local
inbox option which will download the mail from your remote inbox to your local
system inbox before allowing you to read it.

PLEASE NOTE: Use of the local inbox option will preclude accessing the 
             downloaded mail messages except from the system on which the
             messages were downloaded.
