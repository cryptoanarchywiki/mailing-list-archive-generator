Does anyone know of a mailing list organized around political issues
regarding electronic networks, virtual community, the changing roles of
the city and the corporation, and especially issues of class in a "wired"
world?

Much thanx, pls pardon the spam.

PS - be careful about replying to all recipients - this message went to a
couple different lists.
