While most ISP's may not want to be responsible for monitoring 
transmissions, check out a portion of an agreement from mine. 
(I haven't and won't sign such an agreement, may therefore be 
terminated at month's end.)

"4.1  PCIX may elect to electronically monitor any and all 
traffic which passes over our Wide Area Network.  This 
monitoring may include public as well as private communications 
and data transfers from our Members and to our Members as well 
as any and all communications and data transfers to and from 
any other internet sites. ....  The monitoring and disclosure 
activities of PCIX may negate the privacy protections which 
the Member would otherwise enjoy under federal and state law, 
including the Electronic Privacy Communications Act.  Member 
specifically agrees that PCIX may do so and Member understands 
that he or she is giving up privacy rights which he or she 
would otherwise be entitled to under the law."

Hope this isn't the start of a trend!
