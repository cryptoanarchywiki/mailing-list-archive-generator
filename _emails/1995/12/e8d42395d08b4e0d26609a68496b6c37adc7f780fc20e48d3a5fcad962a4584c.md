Mike Bakkes, who is on the EC board, recently brought in
an NSA flying disk. A .gif of it is available at:

http://www.communities.com/foo/NSAfris.gif

We are currently looking for a source of these; we will
be calling the number listed on the disk itself tomorrow
during normal office hours in MD.
