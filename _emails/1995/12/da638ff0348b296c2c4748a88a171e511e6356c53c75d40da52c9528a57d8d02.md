John Gave gave an interesting pitch for Java at the CSSI Computer
Security Day sessions in Cl;evelan yesterday (November 30).  Among
his comments were:

	Java is not secure - it is "safe"

	He (John Gage) regularly downloads binary executables from the
	Internet and runs them on his workstation at Sun - (connected to
	the internal Sun network).

	Sun has terrible physical security - unknown people roam the halls
	at night all by themselves.

	In 2 years, you will be able to buy a computer that does more than
	a Sparc now does, in a portable package the size of a cell
	phone, with more than 30 million bits per second of mobile
	bandwidth direct to the Internet, for less than $30.
