That's not very useful in this context: all it does is move files to
.#{oldname} and then later remove them.

I'd suggest that anybody interested in this topic under UNIX examine the
vnode structures and understand how the filesystem keeps file lists.  Many
vendor UNIces have fairly well commented header files.
