Well when you listen into a spread spectrum conversation what you will hear
is open squelch white noise.  The spread spectrum radios that I know about
send information on several deffrent frequencies throughout the
conversation.  Unless you have a system to receive the encoding bit that
signal what frequency is next you can't easily find the next freqency before
it changes again.  This change happens several time a second.  The
information is "packet-like", that is why you are able to use so many spread
spectrum units at once.  Example, Lynx spread spectrum T1 information signal
(data) is combined with a high rate spreading code (chip sequence). A
multiplier performs the combination.  Because the spreading code is
pseudo-randomly generated, the combined signal occupies a significantly
expanded bandwidth with a lower uniform power density.  At the receiver, a
locally generated, synchronized replica of the spreading code recovers the
information signal, through a second multiplication.  The same code sequence
must be used in the transmitter and receiver to avoic losing the information. 

The coding is direct sequence, 16 x spreading rate, the number of codes is a
9 DIP switch selectable.

Intresting is taht the radio acquisition time is 500 msec, typical.  If this
a security hole I don't know.

Note this is typical of a Spread Spectrum Microwave radio, a lot of the same
applies to 900MHz T1 and cordless phones.  As soon as I have further info on
encryption of signal/Freq. destination I'll post it.
