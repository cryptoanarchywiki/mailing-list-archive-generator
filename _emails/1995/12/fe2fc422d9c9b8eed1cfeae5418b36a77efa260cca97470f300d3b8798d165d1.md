Oh, I don't have their home page enabled. What I meant, but perhaps wasn't
clear about in my post, is that the commercials pop up in Yahoo, Infoseek,
Deja News, Excite, and so forth. (OK, so it is inaccurate to say "Netscape"
puts them in.)

Some of the ads are intertwined with the command boxes of the particular
service, and thus may be hard to excise, but others seem to be separate.

Any ideas?
