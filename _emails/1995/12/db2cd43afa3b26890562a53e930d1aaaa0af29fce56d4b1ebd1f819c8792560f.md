Here are some differences between stocks and currencies.  I don't know how
they effect your arguments, but I do invite comment:


                                Stocks                  Curriences

(1) Voting                      Most stock              Based on residency
                                inplies voting          not net worth

(2) Reputation availability     Many stocks,            Few curriencies,        
                                reputations hard to     reputations well known
                                find

(3) Legal backing               Based on government     same

(4) Dividends                   Commonly payed          never heard of it
