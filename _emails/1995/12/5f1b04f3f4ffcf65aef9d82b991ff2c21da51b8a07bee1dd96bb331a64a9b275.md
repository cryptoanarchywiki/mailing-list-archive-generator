Dear Mr. Blaze:

As you seem to have noticed, a few subscribers to cypherpunks are more
interested in exploring their own personal psychopathologies than in the
creation and spread of strong cryptography.  Please do not feel that you
need to apologize for their actions, and especially please do not restrict
your actions and/or posts because of them.

To correct merely one of the many mis-statements made by these people
desperate to draw attention to themselves, the Linux community is NOT
interested in 'out-of-the-box'.  If we were interested in 'out-of-the-
box', we would be running OSs that COME in a box.  What we ARE interested
in is source (or, if source isn't available, at least 128 bit keys).
If you provide source, we'll port it.  It's that simple.  While support
is nice, and appreciated, it is NOT NEEDED.  We can take care of ourselves.

So, on behalf of the Linux community and those of us running CFS, thank
you very much for your contribution.  And please don't let a couple of
idiots like these lower your opinion of the over 1 million Linux users
who appreciate your efforts and support.
