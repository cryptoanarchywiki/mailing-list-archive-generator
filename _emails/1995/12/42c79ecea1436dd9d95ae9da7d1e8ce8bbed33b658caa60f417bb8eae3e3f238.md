For large environments like this, it's possible to work around the attack
by methods like queueing up all the signature jobs and doing them
serially; this makes it difficult for the Bad Guy to know whether the server 
is taking time doing his multiplications or Alice's or N other customers',
so he can't control timing very well by picking otherwise-informative numbers.

On the other hand, your smartcard or PC is still at risk, since it's _not_
doing a lot of them, unless it's doing them just sort of at random when
it's got nothing better to do and throws the real work in the middle.
