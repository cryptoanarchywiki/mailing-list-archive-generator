I had thought that it may have been similar to an Active Memory
design, but had no real clues to go by. Wasn't sure about the
chip array path width either, but thought that 1 bit was probably
the way to go given the array size.

Hmm... is that the name?

Sorry Thad... but NOTHING 'just disappears' at the NSA...

Hahahahahahahah!!!!!!!!!! A cryptographer's most POWERFUL weapon, is
A False Sense of Security... If you've read Kocher's abstract, you
would NO DOUBT realize that there are ALWAYS options to be explored
and exploited. I'm sorry, don't take it personal, but I think that this
'til the end o' time' argument leaks like a "sieve"... it's the classic
linear thinking thing.

This sounds pretty pessimistic too...

Well... maybe the timing wasn't right for the system's completion.
After all, designing a computer with <1 nanosecond cycle time is not
child's play. And in quantity it is even more difficult. A few more
years of development with Transphaser logic and Holographic storage
could work some wonders in computational capailities.
