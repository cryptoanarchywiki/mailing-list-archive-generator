>On the name database side the PO runs somthing called National Change of
Address which tracks who moved where and allows direct marketing companys to
clean their lists.  Almost everybody sells address change data (utilities,
the PO, credit companys) - I'm getting tons of "welcome to the neighbourhood"
mail since I moved.
--------------
	The basic method for getting around this is to have the mail forwarded
to a post office box. They still know you've moved, but not to where, and the
connection between your physical location (for stuff like gas bills, etcetera)
and the name & address that they did have is loosened.
