Regarding Fred Cohen, PhD:

Cohen's haughty and bombastic style do nothing good for his reputation.  I
assume he advertises his PhD to highlight his early accomplishments; he has
done little since.

Let's also consider the granting institution, a second-rank school.

Cohen's thesis broke new ground, but how many people have read it, or any of
his writings, or know anything about his ideas beyond a single word?  How far
did he carry this work?  Where are the conference and journal papers?  Cohen's
reputation faded into obscurity long ago.  Now he is building a new reputation
as a pig-headed loudmouth, threatening his "defamers."  Shades of Sternlight.
