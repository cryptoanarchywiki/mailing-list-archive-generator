"'Net Dwellers" or "Det Weilers"? Hmmhhh....

In any case, this has already come up a couple of times on the Cypherpunks
list, and was even commented upon by Jeff Weinstein of Netscape a couple of
days ago. The bug was fixed in b3.

I really encourage people who are not following the list more carefully to
check the back traffic before posting bug reports.

Forwarding messages is often the culprit in this, as the forwarder simply
assumes we may be interested, but he has himself not been following the
thread.
