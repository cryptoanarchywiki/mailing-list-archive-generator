Can someone enlighten me as to what the two factors are?

With sensible definitions I've heard you either get one (just itself)
or four (itself [p], both units [1,-1] and the co-whatsitsname [-p]).

(Sorry to pick on tcmay, but usually when you factorise a number you
*never* put it a "1*", for example:
  6 = 2*3
  9 = 3*3*3
and
  7 = 7
not
  7 = 1*7
, so I suspect the usual statement would be "Every prime has one factor.".)


Or am I totally clueless?

Jiri
