It seems like a trivial thing to do, but if email to Congress works to
sway opinion, it should be fairly easy to create thousands of email
messages from different apparent sources each hour, all supporting a
point of view, and to suppliment this effort with a small telephone room
full of people to fill congressional switchboards with supportive phone
calls.  Interesting PM attack.
