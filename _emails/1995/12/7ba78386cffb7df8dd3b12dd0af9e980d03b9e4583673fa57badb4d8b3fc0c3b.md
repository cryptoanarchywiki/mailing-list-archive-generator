A tricky way around this, if it's done ALMOST properly, is to donate in 
odd amounts... ie "Senator Sludgepump, I am going to donate $469.23 to 
your campaign..."

All this means is that the donations would have to be lumped in some way 
so that Senator Sludgepump can't find out the exact amounts donated by 
any individual.

ObCrypto: Donating a specific amount of money could be considered a 
covert channel.
