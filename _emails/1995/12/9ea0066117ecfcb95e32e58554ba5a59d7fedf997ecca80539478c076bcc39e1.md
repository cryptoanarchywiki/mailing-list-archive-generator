Fine for the tiny subset of Net users who understand crypto enough to use
it on a daily basis. I'm not one of people either. This crypto isn't user
friendly stuff. Before you propose such as solution, better make sure
people can use this stuff.

How are you going to pitch this technology to all the people with AOL and
Microsoft Network accounts who barely understand the net? These are the
people who need exposure to all the uncensored expression they can get.

Instead of figuring out how to build a new treehouse that excludes Exon and
Hyde, how about fighting the damned bill in the courts?
