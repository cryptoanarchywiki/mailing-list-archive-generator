You know, you are really starting to annoy me with this $*i+ about how anon 
users are destroying our rights by abusing theirs.  If you dont like it, 
ignore it.  but stop cluttering bandwith with your aimless complaints.  if you 
want cypherpunks to do somthing, SUGGEST somthing!  Stop wining and shut up!!

*sigh* its like people cannot handle their own problems today, except by 
bleating to the public.  I am requesting that anybody who has a problem with 
anon users TALK TO THE OWNER OF THE LIST.
