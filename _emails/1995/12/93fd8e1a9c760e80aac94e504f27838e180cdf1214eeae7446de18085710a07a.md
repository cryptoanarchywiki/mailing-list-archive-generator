Notes.

I've taken this entirely out of context*; cpunks will be glad to
find that the same document manages to hit at least two of the
horsemen of the infocalypse. A few paragraphs earlier is the
standard "must protect women, children, and ethnic minorities"
(paraphrased) argument.

Labour seems likely to form the next government. And even if they
don't, their stated policy might be a good thing to take to the
Tories, saying something along the lines of, "Labour has a clue,
where's yours?" [Note that I was unable to find the Tory point
of view.]

I found this stuff from Anne Campbell MP's home page.
