You obviously have never spoken to Matt.

No, he does research on private escrow. Thats not the same thing as
GAK. Private escrow is sensible -- you don't want just one person with
the keys to, say, the personel records. What happens if they get hit
by a car?

Actually, Matt has a Ph.D. from Princeton.

> WHY IS EVERYONE SO QUICK TO DEFEND THESE PEOPLE?

Maybe I defend Matt because I think I know him pretty well -- we met
when he showed up at the Columbia U. computer science department in
the mid 1980s, and among other things we shared an office at Bellcore
for a year or two, and he's about as cryptography and privacy friendly
a person as you can find.

Maybe I defend him because you are likely an idiot who's never so much
as chatted with him.

Maybe I'm bored.

Who knows.

Perry
