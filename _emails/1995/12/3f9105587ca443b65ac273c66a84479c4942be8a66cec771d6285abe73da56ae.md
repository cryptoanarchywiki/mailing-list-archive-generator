  Can't I be a supporter of strong crypto, and also be in it for the money?
Many people here make good money off of crypto related work.  If I'm asked
to implement GAK in a situation where it is not mandated by law, I won't
do it.

  Tim was referring to the position statement against GAK that we will be
releasing before the NIST meeting next week.

  What I meant, and have said in other places, is that if it is legal to
ship a product without GAK for use inside the US, or anywhere else,
I believe we will do it, because that is what our customers want.

  I'm sorry my dig at the ITAR does not ammuse you.  Your suggested
replacement would not be appropriate since I don't support GAK (I believe
that it is one of the most evil things any government could do to its
citizens), and I'm not in marketing.
