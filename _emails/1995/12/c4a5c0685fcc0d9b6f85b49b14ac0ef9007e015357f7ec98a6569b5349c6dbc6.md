The modern equivalent of that very slow C64 is the smartcard/
electronic wallet.  Sounds like we'll have to implement them
very carefully....

The most interesting detail in the paper, to me, was:

My immediate reaction to the description of the timing attack on 
Diffie-Hellman had, of course, been to do precisely that :-)
