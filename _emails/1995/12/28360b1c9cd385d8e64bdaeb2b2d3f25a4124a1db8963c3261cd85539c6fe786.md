If when Alice sends her encrypted card number to Charlie, it were encrypted
with Charlie's Public Key, then the version that Bob gets is useless if
sent to Don (since it will not decrypt with Don's Secret Key into something
that when sent to Cybercash will yield Ann's CC# when decrypted with
Cybercash's Secret Key). This still leaves the data as valid for use at
Charlie unless the actual decrypt by Charlie contains more than just the
CC#, so as to flag an "replay" attempt (ie: if the sending of the CC# is in
realtime, there could be a check field in there to validate the response as
being for the current request) and reject it.
