Precisely.

Some of the many advantages of having no centralized structure/leadership,
and no formal rules/policies, are:

-- less wrangling over leadership and rules (if you think we wrangle and
fight too much, look at organizations that spend *all* of their time
choosing leaders, having boardroom fights, setting policies, fighting,
electioneering, etc...it makes our easily-filtered flame wars pale by
comparison)

-- no leaders means no one in a position of leadership to sue for the many
"infractions" some of our list members commit (violations of export laws,
posting of stolen code, libel, etc., all allegedly, of course)

-- no centralized focus, save for the toad.com machine, which could be
replaced quickly (or cypherpunks could become "alt.cypherpunks" and then
truly have no center, not that I am advocating this, for various reasons).
This lack of a point of pressure, a center, means opponents have nothing to
jab at...they can't write threatening letters to the "Board of Directors"
demanding that certain actions cease, etc.

Indeed. When I saw this "How long will the Cypherpunks put up with this?" I
initially thought it was tongue in cheek. Apparently not.
