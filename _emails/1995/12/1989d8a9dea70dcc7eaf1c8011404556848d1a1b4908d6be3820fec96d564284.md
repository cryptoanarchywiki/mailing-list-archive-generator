 I wasn't being sarcastic with the "thank you" and I don't usuallly treat
criticism as a neo-flame. 
 
As you may have inferred from other posts of mine, I am more interested and
knowledgable about the social aspects of the privacy/crypto/anon debates
then the code/algo aspects. 
 
I know other peoplw who share my interests but who proceed to write,
publish, comment on the tek issues without understanding them. Getting a
better understanding of them is one of the reaons I'm on the list.
Sometimes I'll venture a view on one of the tek issues, in part to test by
knowledge of those issues from the tek angle. Criticism is first a small
price to pay for the ability to do this. Second, it improves my knowledge
of the tek.
