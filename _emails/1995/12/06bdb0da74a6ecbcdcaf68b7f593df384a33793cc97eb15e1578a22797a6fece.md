I guess I missed Alice's point, but I gave it more thought and Alice is
still wrong:

1) If someone DID monitor Alice, that almost defanitly means the remailer
chain was compromised. The weakest link here is the remailer chain, not
Alice's computer's physical security.*  If Alice's true address is not
known, there cannot be any monitoring of his/her computer (unless it for
some other reason than "Alice").

2) This whole deal is about Alice signing his/her messages, not encrypting
them.  What Alice would be giving up if his/her computer were compromised
would not be security, but identity. The most Alice could lose, IF the
remailer chain were compromised and IF his/her computer's physical security
were compromised is his/her's reputation by spoofing (loss of
pseudo-anonaminity is a given if the attacker gets that far).  Those are
some really big Ifs.

*BTW, the chain is NOT as strong as it's weakest link.  If I send mail to a
remailer, and it strips the headers like it's supposed to, but sends the
mail to a compromised remailer (the weak link), I am just as secure as before.
