>INTERNET DAY OF PROTEST:  TUESDAY DECEMBER 12, 1995
>
>Outrageous proposals to censor the Internet demand that the Internet
>Community take swift and immediate action. We must stand up and let
>Congress know that we will not tolerate their attempts to destroy this
>medium! Please join hundreds of thousands of your fellow citizens in a
>National Day of Protest on Tuesday December 12, 1995.
>
>As you know, on Wednesday December 6, 1995, the House Conference
>Committee on Telecommunications Reform voted to impose far reaching and
>unconstitutional "indecency" restrictions on the Internet and other
>interactive media, including large commercial online services (such as
>America Online, Compuserve, and Prodigy) and smaller Internet Service
>Providers such as Panix, the Well, Echo, and Mindvox.
>
>These restrictions threaten the very existence of the Internet and
>interactive media as a viable medium for free expression, education,
>commerce.  If enacted, the Internet as we know it will never be the
>same.
>
>Libraries will not be able to put any books online that might
>offend a child somewhere.  No "Catcher in the Rye" or "Ulysses" on the net.
>Internet Service Providers could face criminal penalties for allowing
>children to subscribe to their Internet Services, forcing many  small
>companies to simply refuse to sell their services to anyone under 18. Worst
>of all, everything you say and publish on the net will have to be "dumbed
>down" to that which is acceptable to a child.
>
>As Internet users, we simply must not allow this assault against the
>Internet and our most basic freedoms to go unchallenged.
>
>On Tuesday December 12, the organizations below are urging you to
>join us in a NATIONAL DAY OF PROTEST. The goal is to flood key members of
>the House and Senate with phone calls, faxes and email with the message
>that the Internet community WILL NOT TOLERATE Congressional attempts to
>destroy the Internet, limit our freedoms and trample on our rights.
>
>Below are the phone, fax, and email address of several key members of
>Congress on this issue and instructions on what you can do to join the
>National Day of Protest to save the Net.
>
>______________________________________________________________________
>WHAT YOU MUST DO ON TUESDAY DECEMBER 12, 1995
>
>1. Throughout the day Tuesday December 12, please contact as many
>   members of Congress on the list below as you can. If you are only
>   able to make one call, contact House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Finally,
>   if the Senator or Representative from your state is on the list
>   below, be sure to contact him or her also.
>
>2. Urge each Member of Congress to "stop the madness".  Tell them that
>   they are about to pass legislation that will destroy the Internet as
>   an educational and commercial medium.  If you are at a loss for
>   words, try the following sample communique:
>
>   Sample phone call:
>
>        Both the House and Senate bills designed to protect children
>        from objectionable material on the Internet will actually
>        destroy the Internet as an medium for education, commerce, and
>        political discourse. There are other, less restrictive ways to
>        address this issue.
>
>        I urge you to oppose both measures being proposed in the
>        conference committee.  This is an important election issue to
>        me.
>
>   Sample letter (fax or email):
>
>        The Senate conferees are considering ways to protect children
>        from inappropriate material on the Internet.  A vote for either
>        the House or Senate proposals will result in the destruction of
>        the Internet as a viable medium for free expression, education,
>        commerce.  Libraries will not be able to put their entire book
>        collections online.  Everyday people like me will risk massive
>        fines and prison sentences for public discussions someone s
>        somewhere might consider "indecent".
>
>        There are other, less restrictive ways to protect children from
>        objectionable material online. This is an important election
>        issue to me.
>
>3. If you're in San Francisco, or near enough to get there, go to
>   the Rally Against Censorship from Ground Zero of the Digital Revolution:
>
>   WHEN: Monday, December 11, 1995  12:00 - 1:00 PM
>   WHERE: South Park (between 2nd and 3rd, Bryant and Brannon) San Francisco.
>   SPEAKERS: To be announced
>   BRING: Attention-grabbing posters, signs, and banners that demonstrate
>        your committment to free speech and expression, and your feelings
>        about Congress.

>### THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT ###
>
>4. Mail a note to protest@vtw.org to let us know you did your part.
>   Although you will not receive a reply due to the number of
>   anticipated responses, we'll be counting up the number of people that
>   participated in the day of protest.
