These scenarios only matter if the blinded coins have payer info coded 
into them.  With zero payer info you are correct they are irrelevant.  I 
was operating under the (incorrect, it seems) assumption that the blinded 
coins followed what I now understand to be the OFF-LINE ONLY version of 
the protocol.  In that version, where the blinded coin issued to Alice 
has info about her coded on to it and/or there is information about payee 
encoded onto the coin, then such exchanges are necessary to create payee 
anonymity.

Even with the current protocol, you can achieve payee anonymity if you 
send a coin to a coin clearinghouse that deposits for you.  Alice gives 
Bob a coin for value.  Bob turns the coin over to Carol who, for a small 
fee, deposits the coin.  Now bank knows carol deposited the coin, but 
knows of neither Bob nor Alice.   Indeed Bob need have no account at the 
bank at all.  I recognize that there are issues here, esp. for Bob -- 
does he wait on line while Carol clears the coin before telling Alice 
that payment cleared (delays?).  Or does he bear the risk?
