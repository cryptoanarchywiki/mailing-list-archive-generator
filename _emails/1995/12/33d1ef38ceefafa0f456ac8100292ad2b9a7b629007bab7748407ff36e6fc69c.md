Not anything??  That's shameful ... where on earth are the values in 
America, today?  

AT&T and Netscape have jointly made a small fortune distributing this
product, and yet NEITHER company feels that the software engineers who
"voluntarily" made a difference -- a couple of students -- deserve
even a wooden nickel for the ideas which were used.

It's absolutely shameful.  But then, I guess that AT&T and Netscape
have no shame at all.

They just steal "intellectual property" from students, and don't even
pay a token amount.

And people wonder what's wrong with Aemrica?
