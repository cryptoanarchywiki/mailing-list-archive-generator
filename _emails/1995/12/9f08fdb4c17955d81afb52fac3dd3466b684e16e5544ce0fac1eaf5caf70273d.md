     It varies. My SECRET took almost a year and a personal interview
before it was granted. Living 13 years abroad in 5 countries, visiting
the eastern bloc, and having relatives over there, made DISA a bit
nervous. 

    Clearances tend to be easiest for nth generation midwesterners
who are just out of school, have never been anywhere, and have no
known relatives abroad.

    I never went for a TS - I figured it would be too much trouble, and
might have been turned down.  

speaking only for myself...
