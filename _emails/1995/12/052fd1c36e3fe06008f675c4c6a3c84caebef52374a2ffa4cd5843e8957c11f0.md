I had in mind that the utility function was being used by some agent to
determine its course of action.  Imagine the agent trying to determine
which of several services to use.  It may reasonably be expected to
evaluate the utility function for each one, and choose the one with the
highest utility.  "Reputation for honesty" is one parameter to the
function.  Price, turnaround, and reputation for quality are others.  A
smarter agent could consider "metaservices" which bundle the given
service with an escrow agent.  The net effect is to permit the agent to
replace the service's honesty with the escrow agent's for the
evaluation --- regardless of the internals of the model.

The strategy for estimating h(t) should be wholly independent of the
utility model.  Otherwise you'd be effectively unable to make efficient
use of rating services, which do such evaluations as their business.
