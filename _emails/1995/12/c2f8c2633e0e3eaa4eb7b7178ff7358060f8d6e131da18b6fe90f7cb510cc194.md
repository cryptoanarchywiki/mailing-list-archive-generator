I had interpreted the suggestion differently - rather than a system with 
user-accessible crypto hooks, the manufacturer could ship a binary patch
upgrade for US customers to install.  The internal design would presumably
have crypto hooks (i.e. subroutine calls); they can't ban that.

Of course, if you follow this strategy, get export approval for version 1.0,
and ship the US-only patch as 1.1, getting export approval for version 2.0
may be a shade more difficult...
