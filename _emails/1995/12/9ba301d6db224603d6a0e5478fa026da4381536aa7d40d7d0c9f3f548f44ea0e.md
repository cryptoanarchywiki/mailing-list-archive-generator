If Alice gives Bob her key and Bob is not a person with whom Alice has a 
special relationship of trust (e.g. her lawyer), then Alice has no legal 
grounds to complain if Bob *voluntarily* gives Carol, a Cop, Alice's 
key.

If Alice gives Bob her key and Bob is not a person with whom Alice has a 
special relationship of trust (e.g. her lawyer), then Alice has no legal 
grounds to complain if Carol, a Cop, serves Bob with a valid warrant to 
seize Alice's key and in fact does so.  

Furthermore, there are circumstances in some states where even if there 
is a special relationship of trust Bob either may at his discretion or in 
some rarer cases may be forced to divulge the key.  E.g. to prevent a 
crime that is about to be committed likely to involve loss of life.
