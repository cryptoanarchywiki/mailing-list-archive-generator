Once again, I must disagree.  Several bulletin boards I frequent include 
an opening banner announcing that, essentially, all messages left there 
are "public" and can be read by anyone.  I can get the exact language if 
you like.  The message specifically refers to the wiretapping statute, 18 
U.S.C. Section 2510 et seq.  This keeps the sysop, arguably, from 
suffering civil liability if mail is intercepted.  Nobody reads the 
banner, but I believe that it has more effect than a fig leaf.

But how many of those who are less knowledgable about such things expect 
the level of privacy you automatically infer?  Is that expectation 
reasonable?  Does the party have any duty to inquire???

Getting a browser involves going to the store and installing the software 
or surfing to a site and downloading the software.  Then it must be 
installed.

            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
I doubt it in the case of the less sophisticated (and the more 
sophisticated are on their own).  I suspect that Mr. Newbie is more 
likely to pick a browser on the basis of what his friend tells him,  or 
what PC Computing tells him, or the fact that he read about Netscape in 
the business section of the paper.

Getting sued and being liable are very different, just as getting charged 
with a crime and having done something morally wrong can be very 
different.  I am much less confident than you apparently are that the 
court system (and products liability law) are likely to impose duties on 
the makers of browsers such as you suggest.  In an advancing 
technological area, I don't believe that liability will be imposed so 
quickly, especially if some disclosure is made.  What disclosure is 
required is likely to be fact specific on a case by case basis until the 
law has time to develop some sort of standards.

Can I expect to recover from Ford for my injuries in a car wreck because 
I would not have been hurt in a Volvo, when Ford meets all federal 
standards?  Generally not.

Don't forget, taking them to court takes $$$.  And they only have $5 
Billion to pay for lawyers ...
