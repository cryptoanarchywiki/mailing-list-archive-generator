If I understand you correctly, this protcol allows Alice to create one and
only one nym that can't be connected to her real identity.  All of 
Alice's transactions can be linked together and to that nym, but there's 
no way to tag Alice with them.

The main difficulty I see with this protocol is that if things go wrong,
they go very wrong.  If Alice slips up once, or if she's compelled to give
herself up, then she loses everything and gets tagged with all of her
transactions.

Does anyone have a pointer to Chaum's paper?

This is a good idea because it addresses one of the big problems with my
protocol, the impossibility of introducing latency. 

But apart from the problem you mentioned above, isn't there a problem with
setting the escrow amount?  Ordinarily, we'd want to set the amount just 
high enough so that Alice doesn't have any interest in cheating.  
Whatever benefit Alice gains will be offset by the penalty.

How do we put a numeric value on the benefits Alice gets from cheating? 
Don't we create a situation in which a rich guy might be perfectly
comfortable with the risk of losing the money, while someone else might
not?
