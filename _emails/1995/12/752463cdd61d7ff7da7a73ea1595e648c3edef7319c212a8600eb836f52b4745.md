In fact, most forms of recording need willing participation by at least one
party. Wiretaps are the main method of recording information which doesn't
involve willing participation of one of those communicating. Since there
are no laws regarding participation of service providers assisting the
government at gathering information, there is a great deal of leeway
legally.

If they actually pass a law (as in Penn) regarding ISP obligations it'll
probably be fought a bit, but does then put more stress on the situation.
