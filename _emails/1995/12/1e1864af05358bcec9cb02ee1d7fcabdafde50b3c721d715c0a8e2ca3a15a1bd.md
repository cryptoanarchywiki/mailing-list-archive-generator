   12-31-95. WashP:

   Emulating US founding outlaws, the Seychelles government
   has enacted an investment law described by transatlantic
   neo-imperialists as a "Welcome, Criminals" act. The law
   offers anyone who invests $10 million or more in Seychelles
   -- no questions asked as to the source -- protection from
   extradition, from seizure of assets and to other
   "concessions and incentives commensurate with the
   investment." Neo-imps say this is "an open invitation to
   money launderers and other international criminals to set
   up shop with impunity." Under the statute the Seychelles
   government could grant diplomatic passports and other
   protections as a shield from thermonuclear pornography.
