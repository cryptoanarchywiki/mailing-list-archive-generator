Sandy,

The phone companies sold the information as soon as you moved. 
^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^ ^^ ^^^ ^^^^^^
It's called the Blue Book, any library has one for your
area. Welcome Wagons and the like buy them.

You can buy lists by address, sequential phone #'s, types of
services people order, etc. 

A recent real-life example is this:

I ordered caller-id on my phone in Nov. I already have had
three direct mailings for security devices. It is assumed by
being a girl, and ordering caller ID I am in fear.
