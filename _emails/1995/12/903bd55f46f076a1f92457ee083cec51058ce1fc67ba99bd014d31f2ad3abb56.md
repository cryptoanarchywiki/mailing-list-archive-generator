I forwarded a cypherpunks message to technomads, where it got a killer
response, so I'll bounce it back to Cypherpunks...

This is all wishful thinking.  A 26-MHz wide channel such as 902-928MHz
has a channel capacity of 2*26 Mbs or 6.5 megabytes/sec.  So if someone
can tell *that* you are transmitting somewhere within that channel then
they simply record *everything* at that data rate in the entire
channel, your transmission and everyone else's, for the necessary
time.  A $600 3.5Gb Sequel drive can record a ten-minute transmission;
then the eavesdropper can use one Pentium or two dozen, budget
permitting, to extract your message from that data.  If all you are
doing is frequency hopping or spread spectrum, reconstruction is a very
undemanding algorithmic task, and one Pentium should be able to
reconstruct your signal the same day, two dozen the same hour.

Hopping speed is almost completely irrelevant to the computational

To put it mildly.

You can never overestimate the cost of decryption.  What looks
expensive enough today to decrypt can plummet by orders of magnitude on
alarmingly short notice.  We used to think TCP was mildly secure until
easily installed sniffers became freely available on the internet that
would reconstruct a telnet connection and print out the first 100
characters, making it child's play to extract passwords.

If you think that you are secure because the effort of an attack seems
on the high side, bear in mind that the tasks in a systematic attack can
by definition of "systematic" be programmed, greatly easing the
attacker's task.  And once programmed, the program can be distributed to
all and sundry on the internet.

If a given level of cryptographic strength seems adequate for a message,
add several orders of magnitude and maybe you'll be lucky.  

I know of only two really satisfactory places to hide information worth
hiding: combinatorial search space (read: real encryption such as DES
or RSA, with a hefty key), and the real world, which as a search space
is approximately the size corresponding to a combinatorial space
encrypted with a 256-bit key (i.e. the world seems bigger than 128 bits
and smaller than 512).  The latter is distributed in space-time and
frequency (momentum-energy); if you consider only space-time or only
frequency the universe looks like only a 128-bit hiding place in either
case.  Both together give you 256 bits (very approximately, that's a
very round binary number).
