   Daniel,

   During a year in this penitentiary, here's five I heard the
   older cons mutter:

   1. "Applied Cryptography," Second edition just out, Bruce
   Schneier, Wiley, 1996. Flip through it and stare in
   disbelief and awe. Enjoy 2-5 and return, anxious.

   2. "The Codebreakers," David Kahn, Macmillan, 1967. Crypto-
   biblical tales of lying and cheating via momentarily secret
   tricks. Continued in 3.

   3. "Cyphernomicon," Tim May et al, 1006-Far Future. A wad
   of inspiring sci-non-fi of miscreating, eluding hard-bars
   and regaling in off-shore soft-bars. Also, C4.

   4. "Cypherpunks archives," All Wholesomes, <www.hks.net>,
   Infinite. The stingers honey pot for luring beekeepers into
   berzerk swarms. Wear 5 for protection.

   5. "PGP." Download it somewhere somewhat legally while you
   can, practice picking this sitar. And heave some brick-
   bucks at benefactor Phil for malefactor dues.
