I agree that conversion points are good targets for attack.  Therefore
whether conversion services are centralized or distributed will partly
depend on the economy of scale in protection against criminals.  I'm not
sure how much of this economy of scale exists for conversion between
electronic and physical monetary instruments.  But if we're converting
between one eletronic system and another, then cryptographic protocols
reduce the cost of protection to nearly zero for even small organizations.
