Pseudonymous confusion.

S. Boxx and Sue D. Nym (and some others with short duration)
are proven historical nyms of Larry (Lance) Detweiler.
Vladimir S. Nuri is the going suspected (proven?) tentacle;
some believe he is Larry's better self. Dimitri Vulis seems
closely related letter-wise.

Alice originally drew attention when claiming that he had
found a 'huge hole' in Netscape (if configured to run
Postscript code). Alice (now with a penet address) is
claiming to be a Canadian and has knowledge supporting
that claim (according to other Canadians on the list).
He is still attacking Netscape (and ATT) now and then,
in between political causeries.

The obvious other Alice('s) posted for a short period
mainly to make a point about signatures.

Fred Cohen once(?) had a reputation as a virus expert,
being on the panel of various security conferences.
He has since obviously made many enemies on the firewall
list, and now also on this list. He is not a Canadian(?).
He shares Alice's concern for Postscript (and JAVA) on
the WWW but does not come anyway near Alice in political
(occasionally rather funny) muck-raking.

Analysis of writing styles clearly outdistance Larry (Nuri,
Vulis) from (the Canadian) Alice. Fred and Alice are not
as easy to separate, especially when they are flaming, but
probably they are not the same.

Pissy
