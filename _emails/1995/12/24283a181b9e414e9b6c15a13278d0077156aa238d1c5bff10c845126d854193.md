Jim Clark has had ample opportunity to clarify his statements.

He has not clarified his statements and he has not disowned 
the reported version of his comments, despite repeated
requests to do so.

Once again I request him to do so.

Once again I ask what he means, once again I complain that 
if that is not what he meant, he should now say something that 
is unambiguously different from what he was reported as saying.

I have not seen this statement, and I have asked for it:  Once again
I ask for it.  In particular I ask that it be placed on their web if
it says what they say that it says.

It was worse than that:  he said nothing at all, the "clarification" 
statement was a cloudy fog.

Still waiting.

I am sure that by now Netscape knows what its policy is on government
access to keys:   I ask them to tell the world, and to tell the
world in such a way that they cannot retract their words without
some embarrassment.

Clark is not a Netscape employee.

Clark owns a controlling interest in Netscape and is chairman of the board.
Netscape's policies are whatever he says they are, except in the highly 
unlikely event that he is opposed by both Jim Barksdale and Kleiner Perkins 
plus a substantial majority of the lesser shareholders.
