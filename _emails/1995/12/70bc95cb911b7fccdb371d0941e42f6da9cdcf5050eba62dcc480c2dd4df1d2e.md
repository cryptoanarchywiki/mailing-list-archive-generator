	PGP & a fax modem & a good OCR provides this.

	Or PGP the message and either e-mail or telex it.

	A plastic sheet is going to let me read it, and nobody 
	else?  I guess that would work, if one was using ---
	I forgotten what it was called, where you cut a number
	of squares on a sheet of cardboard, put over a sheet
	of paper, write the characters in the spaces, then
	lift the sheet, and write garbage to fill up the rest
	of the sheet, so that nobody else can see what the 
	characters were.  I think I was in kindergarten when 
	we did that, untill we discovered that our teacher
	could read our "secret" messages, without the cardboard
	sheet.  << The handwriting of the real message differed

	Is this the same as Jerry Pournelle "real soon now'?

	I think I'll stick to using PGP and sending e-mail.
