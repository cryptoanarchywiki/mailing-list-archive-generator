And you get the prize because YOU guessed right! Sorry if I wasn't more clear.  

My premise:  Every program of length "n" bytes is simply an XOR away from
every OTHER program of length "n" bytes.  If one of those programs is the
export-allowed program and the other is the export-forbidden program, the
XOR file is the difference between them.   The "only" problem is to generate
the "XOR" file and get it out of the country.  The "getting it out of the
country" part is easy and will presumably happen because somebody not known
to the company does it.  At that point, the only problem is authentication:
This can be done easily using existing PGP digital signatures.

Obviously, only one copy of the XOR file needs to be exported, at least per
revision.  It is arguable that the export of that XOR file is illegal; so be
it.  It would be exported by an unknown person, using an unknown method, and
uploaded anonymously to a foreign server, all without the knowledge,
cooperation, or approval of the company.
