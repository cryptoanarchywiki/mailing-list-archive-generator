	This trend towords governments saying 'This might be illegal,
we won't tell you' is very disturbing.  Doug Barnes reported on it
being the tactic of choice in forcing banks to fall in line & spy on
their customers.

	Compuserve should be encouraged to get a ruling from the
Barvarian/German government on the legality of the groups.  (Does the
EU provide freedom of speech protections, or simply freedom of
inoffensive speech?)  Also, how does this interact with the
harmonization of publications laws with places such as the
Netherlands?  The EU can't be expected to thrive if each country has
totally different publishing laws.

	Alternately, if there are cypherpunks who spend time in
alt.config, we might create groups such as alt.intimate.stories,
alt.intimate.bondage.duct-tape, etc.
