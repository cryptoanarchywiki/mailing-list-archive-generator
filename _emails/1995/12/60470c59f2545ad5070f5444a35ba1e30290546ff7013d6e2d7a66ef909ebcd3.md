You are overlooking the main point that this is a _timing_ attack. Unless
Bob gets to time Alice carefully when she signs his public key (or a message),
there is no basis for the attack. For certificate servers this may well be
an issue, but most individuals don't sign things online. Just beware of
people with extremely precise stopwatches at key signing parties ;>
