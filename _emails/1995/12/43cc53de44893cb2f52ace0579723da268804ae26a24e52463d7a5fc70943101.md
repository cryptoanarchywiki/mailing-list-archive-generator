yes, cyberspace just doesn't have enough acronyms like AFAIK and IANAL etc.
ad nauseam. (I have reason to believe that PTB, or "powers that be" was
actually invented here on this list!!) 

anyway after reading recent messages I propose:

SHTBD!!!!

as in, Something Has To Be Done.

used either seriously or satirically (probably mostly satirically by
everyone here).

example:

"there was a editorialist on TV ranting about the 4 horsemen of the
infocalypse and screeching that SHTBD!!!"

or,

"I was not implying that SHTBD, merely that we are moving into a brave
new world in cyberspace".

or,

"those @#$%^&* online pedophiles are crawling all over the net. SHTBD!!!"

or,

"the @#%^^&* mainstream press is always pointing out new bogeymen
with the concluding moral, SHTBD!!!"


notice that SHTBD is the antithesis of cypherpunk philosophy in that
it tends to imply

1. government intervention
2. coercive force
3. censorship

etc.

hence by using this term and popularizing it, we promote our own agenda
of "cryptoanarchy".

just my small contribution to humanity for today.
