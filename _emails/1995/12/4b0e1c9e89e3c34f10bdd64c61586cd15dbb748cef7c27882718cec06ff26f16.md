   The WP, Dec 15, 1995:


   Internet Mess: Return to Sender [Editorial]

   The negotiations between House and Senate conferees on the
   restriction of pornography in cyberspace have gone from bad
   to worse. A tentative accommodation arrived at last night,
   which the conferees must still vote to accept or kill,
   combines some of the worst of a broad array of misguided
   restrictions on speech, none of them likely to protect
   children.

   Digital claims that its new crawler called Alta Vista, can
   find data on the World Wide Web at speeds of up to 100
   times faster than currently popular crawlers from Yahoo
   Corp., Open Text Corp. or Lycos Inc.
