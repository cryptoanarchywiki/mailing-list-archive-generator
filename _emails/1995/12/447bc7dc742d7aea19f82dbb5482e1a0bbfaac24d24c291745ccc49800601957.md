Well, what's wrong with 
  pgp -f | /bin/sh
? Obviously, it still decrypts before use, and may or may not be
useful depending on your application, but it never has a file with
the unencrypted script around.

It depends on what you want to prevent: copying the scripts, running 
them, understanding them, or what?

To prevent copying/running them, you can use the above script, but
you'll have to type in the passphrase each time (checking that noone
is watching you, which is impossible with a determined su).

If you just want them to not understand, obfuscation should suffice.
(But reverse-engineering can still be applied.)


(On the "supply useless source" subthread, it is possible to define
the term "source code" so as to disallow such obfuscation. See the
GNU GPL ("copyleft") licence for an example.)
