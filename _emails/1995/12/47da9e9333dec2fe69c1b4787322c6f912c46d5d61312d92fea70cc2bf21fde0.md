	I haven't modified my GET, but at the top of all the standard
c2.org web pages (http://www.c2.org/) if you are using pre-1.12
netscape, it barfs at you with a nasty message. I plan on adding a
line for all netscape browsers, with a link to Lance's page, once it
is ready. (Maybe it is ready now, I just haven't looked yet.)
