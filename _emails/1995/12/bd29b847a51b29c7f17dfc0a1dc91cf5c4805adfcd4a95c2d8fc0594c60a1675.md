So?  Companies lie all the time - the bigger the company, the bigger the 
lie, in my experience.  Companies are like governments - they will get 
away with what they can until caught.  Even then, they rarely stop - it 
just goes undercover.

Again, so?  All that it will do is to drive people away from Compu$erve 
into the arms of other service providers.  Maybe some of them will even 
figure out what a *real* ISP is...
