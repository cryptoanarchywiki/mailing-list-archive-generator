Ah... the targets bit perfectly... You  see
fred my boy being zapped by a nym wouldnt hurt SO
bad unless on some level you believed the anon posters 
assertions about your behaviours were TRUE...
you reacted exactly as predicted, as have David Sternlight,
L Detweiler and a host of others... I normally lurk except when
I get a chance to send anon barbs to puncture an EGO as
inflated as yours..

    anon
p.s. You are next vlad...
