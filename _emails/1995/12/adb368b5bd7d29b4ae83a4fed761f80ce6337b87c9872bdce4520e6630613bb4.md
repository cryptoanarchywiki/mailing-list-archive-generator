   12-23-95. WashP:


   CyberCash this week plans to offer its shares of stock to
   the public. It is one of a handful of fledgling companies
   that hope to coin profits by helping others make financial
   transactions on the Internet. But consumers still worry
   that hackers on the Internet can ferret out credit card
   information. CyberCash's technology blocks online seeing of
   unscrambled credit card numbers. CyberCash and its IPO
   advisors believe they have developed schemes that will
   convince lemmings that there is the equivalent of
   steel-plated armor around their life savings as they vanish
   into the Internet's mega-panamaW$.

   "This is the latest Internet digital currency slaughter-
   offer for fat-fee hacking our Widows and Orphans Ever-Safe
   Pensions," choraled a split-gut ice-eyed Santanalyst.
