I don't understand this attitude at all.

There is no constituency for GAK except for law enforcement.  Everyone 
else hates it.  There isn't any legal or constitutional basis for 
believing that GAK is unstoppable.

The more information people have about GAK the less likely it becomes, 
and more and more people find out about it every day.

Perhaps believing our opponents have unlimited power and influence adds 
to the romance of what we're doing here.  But it's not true.

This is winnable.
