I have been to Congress.
I have lobbied them personally.

Oct 2nd & 3rd was when.
It wasn't easy.

I also spent time in the Press Galleries.
That was even harder.
I will be there next October, and will be credentialed
for all four of the different galleries.

Mr. Jeff get real.
You company is now on the record for GAK.
It hadn't until then. But now you are.
Now all the lower levels can decry what Mr. Clark said,
but the damage is already done.

And....if you're not, Mr. Jeff, this being the electronic
age and all, why not get Mr. Clark to clarify it, muddy it,
or downright repudiate it as a misquote or something.

I'd love to see that.
So would a lot of others.

But somehow I don't think that is gonna happen.

Love Always,

Carol Anne
