That's basically the situation in the wonderful world of paper.  What
I'm interested in is how to handle the power-of-attorney case in the
world of bits.  (I've been using PGP as my example, but I'm certainly
open to software that handles it better; suggestions?)  Even if Helen
signs my PGP key, that doesn't do anything other than connect us in the
almighty Web of Trust (for whatever that's really worth).
