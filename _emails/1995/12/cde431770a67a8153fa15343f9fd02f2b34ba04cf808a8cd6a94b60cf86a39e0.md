In today's mailbox I got a pack of marketing slicks from ViaCrypt. They're 
about to release ViaCrypt PGP 4.0 in two editions: Personal and Business. 
The 4.0 release adds some nice new features:
	- recipient groups for sending to several addresses at once
	- a Search dialog for finding keys
	- encryption-only & decryption-only keys
	- signature-only keys
	- key expiration dates
	- a Windows DLL that third-party developers can use (!!)

The biggie, though, are these:

	"Encryption automatically includes Corporate Access Key as additional 
recipient (option)"

and
	"Key selection/display dialogs show only keys certified by Corporate 
Access Key (option)"

So, real CKE will soon be available from an unexpected source. I'm not sure 
whether to be excited or dismayed. On the one hand, any movement towards 
CKE seems dangerously close to the slippery slope of GAK. On the other 
hand, I know a large corp like Intergraph is much more likely to license 
PGP for internal use if it has CKE features-- especially since they can 
hold the keys internally. The DLL is an awfully nice feature, too.
