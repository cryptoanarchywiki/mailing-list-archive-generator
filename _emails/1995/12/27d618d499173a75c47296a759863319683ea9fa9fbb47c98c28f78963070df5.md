This includes *everything*.  The 29 cents plus 2% includes all
credit-card related fees.

Yes, this is absolutely true.  I didn't mean to imply otherwise.  The
question is whether or not the possibility of true anonymity in the net
transactions might widen the door for fraud on the conversion.  I think
that it does, in the sense that there's no good way to answer the
question, "is it reasonable for Robert Hettinga to be cashing in $2
million of ecash today?"  In a non-anonymous system, audit trails could
be called up automatically on any "suspiciously large" transaction, and
this would help to limit fraud (along with some other, less desirable
social consequences).  I'm not saying that this kind of accountability
would necessarily be a good thing, merely trying to explain why banks
are leery of true anonymity.

> So, given that model, what's the problem?

None at all, if you can find an underwriter who is comfortable with the
fact that his investigative options will be limited in the case of
suspiciously large or suspiciously frequent "cash out" events from a
given customer.  Apparently Mark Twain Bank finds that risk acceptable. 
I'm sure the larger banks will be watching quite closely.

I'm sorry, when I said "unbounded" I was talking in a practical sense. 
Very few banks are willing to undertake a venture in which there is a
very-low-probability risk of a failure that is only bounded by their
total asset pool.  Technically, you are correct, that is always the
practical bound.  From a bank's perspective, however, "enough to break
the bank" is a good working definition of "unbounded risk".  They like
their risk bounded at a slightly lower threshhold... :-)

Basically, the criminal in this scenario has a choice between greed and
vandalism.  If he's motivated by greed, and he's clever, he'll push
things slowly in the inflationary direction, as you describe.  If he's a
vandal or terrorist at heart, however, he might get more satisfaction
out of generating the equivalent of overnight inflation at the
billion-percent level.  That's not a decaying monetary system, it's a
suddenly-collapsing monetary system.   The only difference between those
two scenarios is the quantity of bad money the criminal chooses to print
and distribute.  (Note that this is very different from physical
counterfeiting, where the logistics of actually feeding trillions of
dollars into the money supply are quite daunting, and make the
catastrophic-vandal scenario more or less impossible.)

There's a big difference between breaking the algorithm and stealing the keys.

To break a cryptographic algorithm requires either a revolutionary
mathematical discovery or the discovery of a subtle coding flaw.  The
former is in the supernova category, and the latter is probably in the
"major hurricane" category.  However, stealing the keys is a relatively
simple computer crime.  You break into a computer somewhere and steal
some information.  It only breaks a single bank, but that's enough to
satisfy most criminals.....  -- Nathaniel
