     What's the problem? If you're a contractor or agency looking to store
classified data, the NSA approval is essential. There's no pretence in
the ad that the NSA can't read it. It says:

"NSA provides necessary keying material for SSP3110 operation."

and 

"It is available to U.S. Government agencies, military organizations, 
 and defense contractors."

This is not a snake oil product ala "Power One Time Pad" (sic). It's
a real system, approved for use with classified data. I strongly doubt
that there are any known holes (with the NSA supplying the key material,
why should there be?)

Speaking for myself,
