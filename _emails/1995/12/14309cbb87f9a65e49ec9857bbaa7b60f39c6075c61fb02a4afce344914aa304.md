	Key length is not what is needed for better security; more
solid code and better interfaces are needed.  (I might also argue for
hardware keys that are more difficult to steal..)

	Cryptosystems fail because of bad storage of keys, coding
mistakes, accidentally writing passphrases to disk during a swap, etc.
Moving to 2048 bit keys is no help if you lose the key to a
non-cryptanalytic attack.  Moving to keys with a week or day lifetimes
might be better.  

	You need to figure how the system might fail, and design to
protect yourself from those failures.  Keys with a thousand bits
aren't lost to factoring very often.
