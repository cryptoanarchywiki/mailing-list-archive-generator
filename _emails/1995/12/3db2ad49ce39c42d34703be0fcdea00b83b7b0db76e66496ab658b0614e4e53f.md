  I am against GAK.  I have been contributing to EFF for
years.  I have written and faxed my representatives in congress
stating my position against both GAK and government censorship
of the net.  The reason I'm working on security code at netscape
is that I think it may be the only way to foil the government's
plans to remove all privacy from its citizens is mass market
strong encryption software.

  Why do you believe that Netscape has been chosen by the
government to bring GAK to the masses?  Because of the
uninformed and misguided comments of Jim Clark?  Jim has been
educated and the company has taken a firm position against
government control of crypto.  When you go to the store today
and buy netscape you get strong encryption out of the box,
without any GAK.
