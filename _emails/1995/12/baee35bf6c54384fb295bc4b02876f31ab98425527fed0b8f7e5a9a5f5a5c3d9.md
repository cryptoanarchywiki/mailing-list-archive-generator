Uhhm, actually, I said that I don't have a secure machine to run PGP
on, and that I didn't feel that I should have to travel across town to use
a secure machine to ask whether or not Ian Goldberg and or David Wagner
got any moola from Netscape or AT&T for helping to make these
companies a fortune.

Did they get their $25,000, or a scholarship, or a Christmas week or 
two at the Halekulani in Honolulu??

They helped out these companies, and here it is, less than ten days to 
Christmas, and what have these companies done??  

Nothing ... nothing at all ... but freeload ...

Yep, something like that ... you must be paying attention, my friendly
"spoofing" shadow.  The Penet address is simply to prevent huge email from
being mailed to me.  I don't want AT&T or Netscape to mailbomb me for
simply writing the truth about them.

Penet gives me some protection.

I'm not looking to Penet to protect my "identity".  All I want Penet to 
do is provide a way for people to write to me if they want to.

                                  ...just another one of those...
