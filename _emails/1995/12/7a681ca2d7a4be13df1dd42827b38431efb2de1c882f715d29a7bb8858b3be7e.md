    The how is referring to not double spacing isn't it.  Sorry,

I've been up for the last couple of days and didn't even realize it.

What do you mean what I write about?

      I am not an idiot.  I must have downloaded PGP from about 20 million

different places.  They are all either missing files, some times the

darn code won't compile, or when I "tar xvf" half of the files bring

up an error and the computer says it can not create the file.  I'll try

the address that you've sent.  Hopefully I will have better luck. 

      In the persuit of constructing a stable cryptographic program

that uses PGP what features should be included.  Obviously all of

the ones that PGP has and encrypting/decrypting e-mail but what else?
