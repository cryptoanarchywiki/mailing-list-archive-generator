Is there an existing Post Office Bank in Sweden?  If so, can foreigners open
accounts?  The UK's postal bank (Girobank) has become more like a normal
bank and I think foreigners can open accounts.  (The US Postal Savings
System was closed in 1956 or so.)  I'd rather have a Swedish Digicash
account than one in the US.
