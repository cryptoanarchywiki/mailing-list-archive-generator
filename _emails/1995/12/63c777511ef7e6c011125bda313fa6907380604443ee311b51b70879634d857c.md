   12-25-95. NYPaper:

   "Fear Of Freedom: The urge to censor persists." Anthony
   Lewis column.

      The very essence of the on-line world is freedom. The
      effect of the "indecent" prohibition of the telecom bill
      will be to reduce all users of cyberspace to the level
      of children. That is exactly what Justice Felix
      Frankfurter found unconstitutional writing for the
      Supreme Court in 1957, about a Michigan law that banned
      sales to anyone of material unsuitable for children.
      "Surely," he wrote, "this is to burn the house to roast
      the pig."


   "Coming Soon to Computers Everywhere, a World's Fair." John
   Markoff.

      In an era when the Internet has become synonymous with
      commercialism and instant fortunes, Carl Malamud's
      commitment to public service has set him apart. Mr.
      Malamud maintains that there are still two ways to build
      the Internet. One is the high-stakes high-visibility
      route of initial public offerings in the stock market,
      the money-raising approach being pursued by people like
      Netscape Communication's founders, Jim Clark and Mark
      Andreeson. The other route, Mr. Malamud maintains, is by
      soliciting funds and building viable public works
      projects that benefit the common good.
