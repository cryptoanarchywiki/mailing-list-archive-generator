Hi. Here follow the benchmark comparisons w.r.t. revisions 50 & 51. I
decided to wait before posting rev 50 before because the file read &
write results again bounced up with it, and I spent some (very little)
time trying to see if I could have done anything to cause that. With
no results, as usual. Now I also have results for the "greased
weasel", and I decided to send out my numbers for what they're
worth. Not much has changed with the latest release...

I repeat my query: if anybody has suggestions about these huge jumps in 
disk performance, please let me know. I am ALWAYS running the benchmark 
test after a reboot. I login as root, start the process in background and 
log out, and then generally go to sleep. The machine is NOT online, and 
is not doing anything important at night. I have not changed anything in 
the kernel config in the latest 3 revisions. I have a plain old ISA
disk controller, and two generally fullish disks, but again, the
situation did not change notably between 1.3.49 and 1.3.50.

And, I now have to admit that I find it faster, for example, to load a 
huge C file into emacs, and have it do the syntax coloring. I noticed it 
this morning. 

No problems in patching & compiling.
