*Sigh*. Are we really ready to go back to UUCP? It looks like we'll have
to. That is, if someone doesn't set up a couple cryptographically enhanced
subnets first, or come up with some better idea. Interesting prospect,
actually. 

Anyone wish to comment on the prospect of a double blind server, set
outside U.S. borders, that can act as an interface to the rest of the
world, perhaps encrypting or stego'ing the data transfered between it and
the user? Basically, an anonymous remailer that acts as a cross between 
an NNTP, POP3, and SMTP servers.
