I disagree.  Instead it implies that interception and administrative 
review of content will be tolerated where it is "a necessary incident to 
the rendition of his service or to the protection of the rights or 
property of the provider of that service."  Note that it will be the 
provider who makes the definition in the ex ante application.

Even worse, the protection that is given is for "a provider of wire 
communication service to the public."

I would be very surprised if, 1> "provider" was anything but a narrowly 
drawn definition, 2> provider to the public is not specifically narrowed 
as well.
