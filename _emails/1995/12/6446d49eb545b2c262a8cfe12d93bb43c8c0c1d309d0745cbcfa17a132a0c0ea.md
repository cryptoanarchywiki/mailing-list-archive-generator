This type of page hack is pretty easy.  Take a look at _HTML & CGI
Unleashed_ from Netsams press.  Page 410 has a script that can be easily
modified to do something similar.  (Great book, but lacks some of the more
advanced server redirect tricks I have seen elsewhere.)  The example is for
displaying an optional display for browsers that cannot deal with image
maps.  It can be altered to do the same to any browser.

They (the W3O) need to agree what HTML 3.0 consists of before that will
happen soon...
