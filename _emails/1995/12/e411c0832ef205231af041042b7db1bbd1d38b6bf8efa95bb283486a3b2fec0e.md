No, I didn't make that basic a logical blunder. What I was thinking, even
if I didn't go into it, is that the "cleared" agent would be the one within
the office who would actually handle the surveillance.

But I do think the more basic reason is really that the intelligence
agencies want a direct channel to "their" guy.

I'm really pleased to hear about the 20% attendance. Nothing trivializes a
program more than being ignored.
