I agree.  Besides, this whole thing can be done with the existing PGP.
Date: and Message-ID: are two, and they need to be signed.  Date: is a
further problem with Gnus, since the format of the displayed date is
user customizable, but that's a separate issue.

    ...

    Dimitri> The "signed headers" portion may contain the following
    Dimitri> optional fields:

    Dimitri> From: address -- the address associated with the key used
    Dimitri> to sign this message

It's easier to deal with whatever is being used as the From: in the
message.

    ...

    Dimitri> (Of course, the poster could lie and claim in the signed
    Dimitri> portion that the article is being posted to alt.sex.pedo

So you would also include the Message-ID:.

This is basically a Good Idea, and can be implemented using existing
tools.

Here is some to code to implement it for Gnus.  Verification of the
headers is left (at present) as an exercise for the reader.

;;; Add this to your .gnus and call
;;; gnus-article-sign-message instead of mc-sign directly.
;;; Pgp signed messages are vulnerable to various kinds of badness due to
;;; the separation of header information.  Fix it.
