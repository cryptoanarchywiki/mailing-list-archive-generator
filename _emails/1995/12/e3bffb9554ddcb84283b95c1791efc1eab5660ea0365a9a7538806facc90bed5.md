On Monday, December 11, my attorneys filed a Plaintiff's Opposition to
Defendants' Motion to Dismiss in the case of Karn vs US Dept of State
et al.

I have HTMLized our filings and added them to my web page. Please feel
free to peruse them. Also, let me know if you spot any obvious typos;
I had to do quite a bit of manual editing, particularly in the
footnotes, to make the result look good in HTML.

The government now gets the chance to answer our opposition. They were
originally scheduled to do by December 13, but since our own filing
was delayed over the weekend by the judge's concurrence the government
will probably get a few extra days to respond.

Note that we have asked to make oral arguments on the motion. I'll let
everyone know if or when this will happen.
