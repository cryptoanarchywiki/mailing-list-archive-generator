I think you would see alot less donations by the corporate powers that be
and the favormongers.  (Which is why such a system will probibly never come
into existance.)  It would be a good step in the right direction.

However...
I live in a state which just inacted a series of campaign reforms.  The
first thing the lobbyists did was find a way to exploit every loophole
possible to get around that legislation.  Such a system would have to be
pretty tight and pretty specific.  (And therefore will be fought against by
almost every politician ansd lobbyiest on the planet.)  The fundraising
dinners will certainly have to go...
