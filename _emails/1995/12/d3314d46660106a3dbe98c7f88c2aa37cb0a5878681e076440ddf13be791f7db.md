You know why they want that, don't you?  So if you don't pay your 
bill, they can ding your credit report.  PG&E will do the same thing 
to you, and they will both do it illegally, without notifying you 
first as they are required to do by law.  So, I'd advise you to check 
your credit report regularly for signs of abuse.
