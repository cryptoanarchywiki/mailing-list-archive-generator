  At the NIST meeting our representative made a strong statement
against the governments GAK proposal, and government interference
with crypto in general.  If I'm not mistaken that was a government
and law enforcement forum.  We want to sell (and give away) products
that contain strong encryption, and our customers want to buy it.
We are beginning to take a more active role in trying to achieve
this goal.  Its not happening fast enough for me either, but it
is happening.
