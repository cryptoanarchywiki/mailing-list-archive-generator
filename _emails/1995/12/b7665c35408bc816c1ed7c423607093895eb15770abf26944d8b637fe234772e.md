Let us contemplate in which type of situation the payee will send such a
wildcard coin. To pay a shop via TCP? No. The payment request comes in with
the shop ID. The resulting payment won't be done with a wildcard coin.

So when will the user pay with a wildcard coin? To make a payment to a party
that is (pseudo-) anonymous to the payor. That is, if the payor sends the
payment via anonymous remailer, in which case the messages should be
encrypted anyway.

[Why a remailed message should be encrypted is left as an exercise to the
reader.]

As mentioned before, this will be fixed.

One more time: this is only an issue if the payor is using a secure http
connection. Otherwise, you can gather all that information with out without
Ecash. The next release will use an already established SSL connection to
transmit this information, should the payor request it.

This is raising an issue that has nothing to do with Ecash. The complaint is
in fact about the lack of a gereral link encryption on the Internet. I agree
that this is needed, but providing it really isn't Ecash's job. I am eagerly
anticipating the general use of IPSEC.

That's why the next version will use existing SSL, should the user so desire.

Will do.

Writing all this down takes time. DigiCash may hire a tech writer soon. That
should improve communications between all parties.
