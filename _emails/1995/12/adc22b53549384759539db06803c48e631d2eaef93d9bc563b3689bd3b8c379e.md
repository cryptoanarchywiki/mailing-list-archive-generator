	No, you are not required to identify yourself to the government
when communicating with it in all situations.  Certainly, there are many
situations when you are required to do so, but there are numerous
channels in which anonyminity is permitted, and sometimes even
guaranteed.  Ironically, most of these are in law enforcement/public
safety situations (anonymous tips, whistleblowing, etc).
