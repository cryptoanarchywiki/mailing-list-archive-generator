That's one of the most politically and socially naive statements I've 
ever heard.  Corporations *never* do the "right thing" unless it will 
increase their profits.  Remember, corporations are in business to 
make money by providing a product or service that people will pay 
money for.  Whatever gets in the way of that will fall by the 
wayside.  That's an economic fact of life.
