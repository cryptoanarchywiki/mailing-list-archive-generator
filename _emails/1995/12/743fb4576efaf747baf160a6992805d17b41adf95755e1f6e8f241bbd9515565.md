   12-24-95. NYPaper:

   "Case Involving Free Speech And the Internet Is Settled."

      A dispute about free speech on the Internet has been
      settled out of Court here after a local school district
      admitted that a high school principal had wrongly
      reprimanded a student for lampooning his school on the
      World Wide Web. The school district apologized to Mr.
      Paul Kim for the punitive actions. "We now know our own
      boundaries," said Ann Oxrieder, the school district's
      spokeswoman. "The Internet is unexplored territory for
      schools and we now know that when a student uses his own
      equipment and on his own time, we should stay out of
      it."
