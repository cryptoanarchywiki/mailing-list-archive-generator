It is definitely legal for private entities to have strict control over
their own resources.  In particular, it is legal for a company to listen
in on their phone conversations for quality control purposes if they
announce this fact ahead of time (you may have heard such a disclaimer
when you call tech support, for instance).

Also, if a student signs such a waiver acknowledging that the situation
at this school is not necessarily that of the "norm" or of potentially
overriding state or federal law, there is a good chance the student has
signed away their right/priviledge of absolute privacy.  Unless there
is serious violation of Constitutional rights or if the contract is
constructed or negotiated in bad faith or in some illegal manner, the
old saying applies:  "a contract is a contract".
