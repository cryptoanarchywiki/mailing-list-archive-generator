Is it just me, or does this sound like a challenge?

Personally, I'd much rather see a true e-cash system (like Digicash's)
succeed than some pay-by-cleartext-email non-anonymous system.

Maybe Sameer will create a Hack FV page :-)

Or maybe NB will offer a $1000 bug bounty to anyone who can successfully
forge a transaction in FV's system (since it's so foolproof)...
