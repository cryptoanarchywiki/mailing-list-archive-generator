| By popular request, DigiCash is releasing the protocol specs.
|
| The specs are available at 
| http://www.digicash.com/ecash/protocol.html
|
| Please be aware that the doccument is work in progess. More 
| specifications, including byte level descriptions of the message 
| format will be added throughout the weekend.

	And of course, you'll be including a description of how you
generate random numbers for use in keys and blindings?  I ask only
because I didn't see a place for it on the Digicash site.
