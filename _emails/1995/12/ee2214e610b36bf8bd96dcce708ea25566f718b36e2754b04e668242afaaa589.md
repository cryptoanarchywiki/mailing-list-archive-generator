This is not just in San Francisco...  Portland, OR has been having some
pretty bad problems with power outages.  (My ISP was offline all last
night.)  I expect that Seattle will be having similar problems due to the
storm front that just went through.

As for the NSA controlling the Weather Orginization...  That only counts as
a successfull attack if they have the Evil Geniuses for a Better Tommorrow
assisting in the attack.  (And they are controlled by at least one computer
group.)  Sorry...  Been catching up on my mail from the Illuminati mailing list.
