        The Founders created a larger space for free speech than had ever
existed.  Slaves were deprived of many freedoms including speech, of course,
but women and free blacks were included in the Bill of Rights and exercised
free speech, frequently compellingly.  

        Check out Frederick Douglass' practicing oration while still a
slave, and then winning his freedom to become one of the greatest
abolitionist orators.  Consider the appreciation of diversity of thought and
speech manifested by Jefferson, Lincoln and many other American political
leaders.

        Invoking poitically 'correct' stereotypes does not strengthen your
argument.
