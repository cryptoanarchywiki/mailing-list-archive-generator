How about an obvious solution, like the password feature on After Dark?  If
I remember correctly, there's a hot-key combination you can use to bring up
the screen saver mode immediately as you get up from the machine.  It's
obviously not foolproof, but just blanking the screen and going into a
password mode would probably deter the casual browser.  If you're really
worried, change your autoexec so it goes into windows and starts AD immediately.

Low tech, maybe, but easy!
