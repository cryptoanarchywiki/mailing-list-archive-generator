                          This is a working document, subject to change. 
                                                   Please comment on it!


Skronk is a user-level C library that re-implements the usual "posix
i/o" (unix man 2) functions and "berkeley socket" functions with a set
of functions that can use enhanced or alternate ("skronked") protocols
for TCP connections.  (Typical enhancements could be authentication
and/or encryption of the connection.)  A simple negotiation protocol
allows the clients and servers to agree on what enhancements are
desired or required.

Skronk is designed so that your common unix network clients and servers
(telnet, sendmail, ftp, nntp, X11, etc.) can be merely relinked with the
skronk library (libskronk.a) without changing the source code for the
programs.

As a matter of configuration and policy, skronked clients and servers
may choose either to interoperate with normal (non-skronked) client and
servers or to forbid normal connections.  In order to not interfere
with non-skronked programs, skronked connections take place an
alternate TCP server port numbers.

/* "Skronk" is a musical term, for a new-york-ish free-jazz 
 *   massively saxaphonish kind of music, e.g. John Zorn  
 */


---- THE UDP PROTOCOL BEGINS HERE ----

THE SKRONK MAP DAEMON

A skronk map daemon is a UDP service that tells what skronked services are
available from a site, and what alternate TCP server port numbers they
use.

The skronk map daemon receives "skronk map request" packets and returns
"skronk map reply" packets that list pairs of port numbers, mapping
normal server port numbers to corresponding skronked port numbers.  The
skronk map reply packet is sent to the same IP address and host port
that the request was received from.

If there is no map reply in a certain time, after a couple of 
map request resends, the skronk map client should assume that 
skronked services are not currently available on that host.

SKRONK MAP REQUEST PACKET

See "struct skronk_map_request" below.  The comment will say
something like "finger skronk@yak.net for info", to explain what
is going on to network administrators who see these packets for
the first time probing their hosts.

SKRONK MAP REPLY PACKET

See "struct skronk_map_reply" below.  The "serial" field should
match the serial field of the map request packet.  Replies be cached,
using the "ttl" time-to-live field for a timeout.

If the request packet cannot be replied to (perhaps because the action
was not understood, or the version was wrong), a reply with action
SKRONK_MAP_NACK should be returned.  If the magic field of the request
is wrong, do not reply.  (The magic number should be changed if the
first five fields are changed; otherwise, version and opcode may be
changed to implement new protocols.)

Skronk map clients should also recognize as a reply the 
relevant ICMP packets indicating that there is no skronk map daemon.

Version numbers 128 through 255 will not be assigned and are
available for experimentation.  Action codes 128 through 255 will
not be assigned and are available for experimentation.

Initial prototypes use UDP port 333 for the skronk map service,
until a number is officially allocated.

 *     problems (like it would bring a less-than-1024
 *     port number to be greater-than-1024), in which
 *     case subtract 400.
 *
 * I propose this rule as a default, since it does not seem
 * to collide with common port numbers, but because we 
 * have and always use the skronk map daemon, each site
 * could pick different numbers.

---- THE UDP PROTOCOL ENDS HERE ----


SKRONK PER-CONNECTION NEGOTIATION

/* 
 * The current skronk prototype temporarily works on 
 * a simpler negotiation scheme, but below is the
 * intended scheme.
 */

/*
 * Good questions:  
 * 1.  Would telnet-style negotiations be better?
 *
 *      I conclude not:
 *      -- this offers options to be combined at once
 *      -- this does fewer passes from server to client
 *      -- this uses ASCII names rather than numbers
 *              for options, which allows liberal 
 *              experimentation with "x-" names.
 *
 * 2. Do we need some escape-character & character-stuffing 
 *    to re-open negotiations?
 *
 *      Maybe... but flow of control probably never returns 
 *      to the skronk layers with any such requests, so let's
 *      let some escape-octet (with escape-octet-stuffing) 
 *      option for return-to-negotiation be a negotiated
 *      option that can be added later.
 */

The skronk library does a negotiation at the beginning of each TCP
connection, after "connect()" and "accept()" rendezvous, before
returning flow of control to the application.  This negotiation is
transparent to the application, but may be configured with skronk
configuration files or environment variables.

These negotiations should not be confused with other negotiations
specific to the program, such as TELNET negotiations, which would occur
later, once control is returned to the application.


/*
 *  I should first define 'negotiation line', 'acceptance line', 
 *    and 'disconnect' to describe the following...
 */


When the connection is made, the server writes a line of 10 to 999
octets, composed of ASCII characters, terminating with CRLF, to the
client.  This line must begin with the eight characters

        'S'  'K'  'R'  SPACE  h  t  o  SPACE

where h, t, and o are three decimal digits '0'-'9' (hundreds, tens, and
ones places), with leading a zero in the hundreds place if required,
specifying the length of this line, counting the CRLF at the end.  Thus
the minimum length of the line is 10.  The reason for putting the
length of the line in the front is so that the client can first read 8
characters, and then read the rest of the line, but not try to read any
characters beyond that size.

After the "SKR hto " follow zero or more words of the regexp form

        [A-Za-z0-9+][A-Za-z0-9/.+-]*

separated by one or more SPACE characters.  Case matters.  These words
specify protocols, and should registered with strick@yak.net, or begin
with "x-" for experimental protocols.

By sending this line, the server volunteers to server this protocol
skronked with any of the listed protocols.  The server should list the
protocols in order of preference, its favored protocols first.

The client reads this line, chooses one (or more) protocols, and
responds with a similar line, listing only the protocol(s) that it
chooses to use, in a specific "stacking" order, from the first protocol
applied to the last.  For instance, if it chooses "gzip" compression
followed by "des" encryption, it should list them in the order "gzip
des".  Some protocols choices may not be compatible, and some protocol
choices may not have stacking order; this will have to be described
when the protocols are defined.

If the client does not like any of the choices offered, it may hang up
the connection, instead of replying with a line.

If the server accepts the protocol the client chose, it responds with 8
characters

        'S'  'K'  'R'  SPACE  'O'  'K'  CR  LF

If not, it may either disconnect the connection, or it may send another
initial negotiation line, which should be different from the initial
line offered (probably with fewer options for the client to choose).


If the negotiation is accepted, what happens next depends on the
accepted protocols, and on the actions of the rest of the program.
Typically a selected protocol may have to do some more negotiation or
trading of data before control is returned to the application.  And
later reads and writes from the application to the skronked socket may
be intercepted and frobbed.


PRIMORDIAL PROTOCOLS

For stream encryption:

	/* needs work */

	A simple initial protocol named "dh/idea.1".

	Use Diffee-Hellman key exchange from RSAREF 2.0.
	Let the server declare the R_DH_PARAMS, and the size of things.
	Use IDEA encryption in CFB mode from PGP 2.6.
	No authentication -- susceptible to man-in-the-middle 
	attacks at connection time.


For authentication:

	/* needs lots of work */

	A simple initial protocol named "auth-pgp.1"

	Use PGP public keys and certificates to create
	a web of trust and thereby authenticate hosts.

	Can be combined with "dh/idea.1" or used separately. 

	(This probably requires having secret key pass phrases
	on multiuser machines, so it's one small step forward.)
