There's another angle I may have mentioned before.  Many 
electronic phones come with a ``feature'' that allows you to 
call home, produce an electronic tone and eavesdrop on your own
house.  When the tone is sounded, the ringing stops (or never
starts) and the phone goes into ``off hook'' mode (i.e., the
microphone in the mouthpiece is turned on).

Even if you did not buy this feature when you bought your phone,
it is still there, just waiting for that electronic tone.  You 
can't produce it, because you didn't buy the doohickey, but anyone
with such a doohickey can call your house and listen in. . .
