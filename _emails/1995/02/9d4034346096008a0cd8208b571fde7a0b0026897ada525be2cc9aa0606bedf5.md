  I have been hacking yet another emacs to pgp interface for some time
now.  I am happy with the current state of affairs, and am releasing
it for general consumption.  It supports automatic decrypting,
signing, signature checks and interfaces nicely with rmail.el and
sendmail.el.

  Also it includes a set of remailer functions which parse the ping
reports from Raph Levien <raph@CS.Berkeley.EDU> and give you a simple
interface to chaining a bunch of remailers together.

  The code is liscense free; use it, sell it, hack it up, export it,
claim it is yours, I don't care.  Feel free.  (How could I stop you
any way?  I suspect that number theory, and complexity theory *are*
the real natural rights.)

  My code is in ftp://ftp.markv.com/pub/jpp/pgpelisp/*

  It is not yet very well packaged.  Read 2b.emacs.  I still want to
clean up the remailer stuff a little before I spend time packaging.
(C-C commands, reply block building, and estimates of a chain's
reliability, (support for ghio and julf {pseudo, ano}nyms?))

  Unfortuneately my net connection, and means of support here at markv
will likely soon be gone :(...  This may be the last chance I have to
distribute or work on this code for a while.  If the code impreses you
with my ability to hack, you might want to make me a job offer :) Or
point me to jobs.  OTOH, if my ability to hack doesn't impress you,
please be quiet until I do get another job :).
