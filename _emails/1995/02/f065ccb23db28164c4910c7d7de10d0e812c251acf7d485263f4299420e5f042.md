NETCHEQUE WANTS TO BE YOUR CYBERBANKER The long-anticipated digital
commerce boom hinges on one important factor -- the ability to safely
and securely conduct monetary transactions in cyberspace. A team of
scientists at the University of Southern California are working on a
system called NetCheque that would allow banks and their customers
send an electronic check over the Internet, complete with a digital
signature that cannot be forged. "With NetCheque, if your balances are
positive it's like a checking account. If they're negative, it's like
a credit-card account... It really depends very much on how you want
to set up this very flexible mechanism," says the USC team leader. The
system was recently released for testing, and those interested in
participation should send mail to netcheque@isi.edu. (Chronicle of
