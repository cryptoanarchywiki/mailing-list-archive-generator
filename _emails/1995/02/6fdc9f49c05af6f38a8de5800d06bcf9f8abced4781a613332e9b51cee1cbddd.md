And hard on the heels of the ratification of the Bill of Rights came the
Alien and Sedition Acts.  The Founders were so distressed by the size of
the space for free expresion they had allowed to be created that they
took immediate steps to limit it.

It is well to remember that the Bill of Rights was a bone thrown by the
Founders (that is, the Federalists) to sweeten the bitter pill of the
process of centralizing government power.  An afterthought, actually.

Arguing _ad_hominem_ doesn't strengthen yours.
