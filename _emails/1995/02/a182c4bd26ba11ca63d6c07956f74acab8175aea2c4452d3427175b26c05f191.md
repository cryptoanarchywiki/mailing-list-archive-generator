There are different uses for public-key systems, and some systems
support some but not all of the uses.  For instance,
Diffie-Hellman is useful for key exchage (and patented till 1997),
and the NIST/NSA's DSS Digital Signature Standard is useful for signatures,
especially if you like subliminal channels in your signatures :-), 
though the patent status depends on whether you believe NIST or RSA ....
