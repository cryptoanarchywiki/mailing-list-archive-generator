Here is the reference, additionally there is a nice News & Views article 
on page 993-994 of the same issue..

Author   Adleman LM. 

Title    MOLECULAR COMPUTATION OF SOLUTIONS TO COMBINATORIAL PROBLEMS.
   
Source   Science.  266(5187):1021-1024, 1994 Nov 11.

Abstract
    The tools of molecular biology were used to solve an instance of 
the directed Hamiltonian path problem. A small graph was encoded in 
molecules of DNA, and the ''operations'' of the computation were performed 
with standard protocols and enzymes. This experiment demonstrates 
the feasibility of carrying out computations at the molecular 
level.
