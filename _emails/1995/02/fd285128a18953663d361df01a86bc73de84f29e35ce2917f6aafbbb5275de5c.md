Now that I've just spent some time compiling and playing with Matt's ESM
program, it seems almost perfectly suited for prototyping Pipe-Net 
since you can use it to do nested encryption.  All that's needed is 
to hack it so that it implements link encryption (i.e., send a
constant stream of random data in between keypresses).

This is what the user would do: (LESM for Link Encrypted Session Manager)
lesm -l
lesm -l
login to server 1
lesm -s
lesm -l (or better yet take over a free LESM session already running
		 between server 1 and server 2)
login to server 2
lesm -s
lesm -s

I wonder if Matt has the time and interest do this...  If not then I 
guess I can try, but I've never done real crypto programming before...
