Keith Henson asked how to find the digital-time-stamp folks,
Surety Technologies Inc., started by Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta 
as a spinoff of Bellcore.

They're now actively in business - there was an article in one of the 
trade rags that you can get their signature kit for PCs for
something like $50 with tokens for 50 notarizations.
Details on their web page.
