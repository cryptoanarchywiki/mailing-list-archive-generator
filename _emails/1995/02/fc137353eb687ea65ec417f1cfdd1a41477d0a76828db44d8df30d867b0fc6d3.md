I agree that cyberspace is certainly becoming more complex and
interconnected.  However, just as a complex ecosystem is not necessarily
more stable than a simple one, and a complex cipher is not necessarily
more secure than a simple one, greater complexity in cyberspace does not
necessarily imply that it is less vulnerable to to centralized control.

But if you wanted to exert greater control over others, you would also
be pushing for increased dimensionality, because that shrinks the world
and moves everyone closer to you.  If you look at history, increased
connectivity has always been necessary for increased central control.
What I am saying is that increased connectivity alone does not
necessarily favor decentralization.  What makes the difference is the
details -- the nature of the connectivity.

I'm not quite so optimistic.  One way to control a distributed system
such as the Internet would be to use a distributed method.  I.e., use
something like the Internet Worm, but a thousand times subtler and more
powerful.  There is no need for them to "stop the Net", just to subvert
a substantial part of it.
