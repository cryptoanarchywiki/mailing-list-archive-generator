By anyone with the resources to snoop up- and down- stream of all the

Yes, but...  The very act of going to the trouble of using these remailers
means that you are dealing with someone powerful enough to read past forged
From/From: lines.  Does it take that much more to snoop these sites?  My
gut says no.  Everybody harps chaining.  Does snooping take more effort
than compromising?  I think it would be hard indeed to say so.
 
So if we think Eve can compromise some remailers, and/or read past
From/From: faking, we are, I believe, forced to believe that Eve can snoop
all the remailers.  Threat models need to be uniform in the power of the
opponent.
