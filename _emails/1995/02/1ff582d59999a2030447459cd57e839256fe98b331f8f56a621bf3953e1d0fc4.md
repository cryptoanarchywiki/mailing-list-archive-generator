Are the minutes of the deliberations of X9, in complete or digest form,
available to the public anywhere ? It would be useful to get a sense of how
close the vote was, whose representatives voted which way, and the arguments
the members found most compelling in reaching their decision. We need to
gather as much feedback as possible, in order to determine which strategies
are liable to be effective in the future. The answers may not come as a
surprise, but confirmation of our suspicions would be nice.
