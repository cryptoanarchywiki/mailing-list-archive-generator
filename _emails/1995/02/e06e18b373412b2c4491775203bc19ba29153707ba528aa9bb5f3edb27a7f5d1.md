Just use netnews for mail then.  We can divide up netnews into different 
regions pgp.us.ca.north  pgp.us.ca.south etc. and then just post pgp'd 
messages to the net.  Kinda like blacknet.  Ok so there's a high cost 
involved in it, granted.

Also writing a bot to search through net news daily for anything signed 
with your PGP key isn't too difficult.

Indeed citizen-unit.  Wait over in the corner for processing.
