I am not sure what is going on with remailer@nately. I just tested it,
sending a PGP encrypted message chained through it 3 times, I also sent a
message chained through nately to c2. They both worked fine. Are you using
a program to build the chain, like "Chain"? If so, which?


Mixmaster now has a PGP key (it has had one for a long time for testing
purposes, this is a new one). The front end for using mixmaster remailer
type 2 messages is on my WWW page. Right now it only runs on Suns.
