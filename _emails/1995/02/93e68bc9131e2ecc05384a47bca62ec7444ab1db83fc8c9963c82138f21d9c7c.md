Yes, this bill is real, and it passed the house resoundingly.  (I don't
know if the bill number is accurate.)  According to the ny times, the
republicans have been trying to pass this for a long time, and now they
control congress.

Interestingly, the ATF and IRS are specifically excluded!  The bill was
opposed by both civil liberties groups and gun nuts.  (Hope I don't offend
too many gun nuts.)  The ATF was excluded as a sop to the NRA I suppose.


During debate, Rep. John Dingell (MI) called the ATF "jackbooted American
fascists."  Way to go John!
