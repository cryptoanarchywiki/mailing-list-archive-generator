I'm not sure I understand the first question.  My idea was originally 
based on link encrypted streams.  How can forwarding variable length 
packets help untracibility?  Wouldn't an attacker just have to match 
up the sizes of incoming and outgoing packets?  Forwarding fixed 
length packets, on the other hands, just makes the system a 
remailer-net (so you'll have to do mixing, etc.).  What am I 
misunderstanding here?

I just finished hacking ESM to do link encryption.  (see my 
other post)  Now if someone is willing to run a MUD type program and 
hook LESM up with it, then we'd have the first prototype of a 
pipe-net.
