| that too. Thanks.

	I seem to recall that md5 is explained pretty well in
Schneier.  You may be doing this to learn, which is great, but you
might be pleased to know that there are several md5 programs already
available.  Tripwire includes one, and there was one included in a
CERT/CIAC advisory last year.
