IMHO, an ideal message would have the ability to handle nested objects
of varying types, MIME is only a start. To construct a unique format
for remail_messages is reasonable, perhaps even preferable. But of
course, MIME *could* be a start, in a brown'n'serve roll sort of way.

However, with a proprietary approach,
what to use for delimiters, or quasi-parentheses (in the case of n
layers of nesting, encrypted or unencrypted) needs extensive and
careful consideration. This is the same dilemma many developers face
with document-centric interfaces and their plethora of odd-bird formats.

I say take the remail stuff out of the header altogether,
MIME or not.
