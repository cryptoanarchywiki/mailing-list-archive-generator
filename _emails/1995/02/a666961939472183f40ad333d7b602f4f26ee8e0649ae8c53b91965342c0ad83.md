On the other hand, they also get forwarded to people not on the list who
may be interested, which helps.  Bruce's went to 3 or 4 mathematically
aware people I know. The work of Mssrs 'corn, Froomkin, Hughes, Finney,
May, et.al. get re-zinged all over the place by yours truly.

Some of us don't have the chops to comment on the <mostly> excellent
content of this list. We still appreciate the work.

Thanks to all of you.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
