True, but this has two basic assumptions that I disagree with: first,
that we can guarantee delivery of a broadcast message to all interested
sites; and second, that remailers never go down for unexpected reasons.
When the day comes that both networks and software are perfect, this
method will be reliable. Of course, you are also right that broadcasting
is undesirable; that is why I am pondering a way to minimize the impact.

But, if my understanding of remailer operation is correct, this has two
potential problems: first, I will still receive mail during the day,
causing a bandwidth concern (I know, it's probably not a problem right
now, particularly since users will probably choose to avoid a remailer
with a possible 16 hour delay); and second, the machine delivering mail
to me simply has to trust that a remailer will in fact pop up on this
machine to process the stored mail. There is no way of determining that
mail is not simply going into a black hole. And even if I try to be nice
when the mailer goes down permanently and tell everyone not to route
mail through it any more, that news still has to travel via word of
mouth to all users of the web.

I am not happy with my proposed advertising methods, and was quietly
hoping for some guidance from internet gurus in this point (the irc
suggestion in particular is a pretty shaky straw man). However, see my
earlier message (on some other thread) about Usenet propagation times.
Propagation times in days do not seem to be rare (post to misc.test and
see when the last reply comes back). While this is better than
word-of-mouth propagation, it does not offer the very low latency I was
looking for.

It strikes me as critical; right now, a user has to choose to trust a
set of remailers, given no assistance other than a list of "reliable"
ones. Given an extended web of trust between remailers, the user can
choose to trust one remailer (I have no idea how to make this process
more palatable) and immediately gain the security of a large web of
remailers (maybe you are right about that instant gratification
thing...)
