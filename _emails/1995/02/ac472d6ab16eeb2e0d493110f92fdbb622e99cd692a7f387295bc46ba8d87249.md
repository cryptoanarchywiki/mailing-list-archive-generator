She doesn't get that.  A signature lets her prove that she sent a
message.  It doesn't let her prove she didn't send a message.

I don't really understand this threat that Alice may be "spoofed".  Why,
of all places, would her opponents try to spoof her through an anonymous
remailer?  Isn't this kind of like sending mail with no return address,
and pretending it comes from someone else?  This seems terribly subtle.

This would be a good thing, agreed.  And requiring signatures probably
would weed out a lot of the flakes, largely by raising the threshold of
cluefulness needed to use the network.

This is not clear to me.  My hope would be to persuade the PGP developers
(many of whom read this list) to incorporate a pad feature in future
versions so that messages can be easily rounded up to a standard size.
Alternatively the mixmaster client may include this capability.

I can see the problem with standard packets in a chaining context, that
they would shrink slightly in size as each successive remailer stripped
off its envelope.  Re-encrypting would solve this by providing more
padding.  OTOH you can actually stick padding into a PGP packet if you
know what you're doing.  I have a perl script around somewhere which will
do this.

It is true that encrypting messages intra-remailer would prevent this
attack as far as that one remailer in the chain is concerned.  But it
seems to me that the message still suffers from this attack against the
remailer network as a whole.  This points up the fundamental problem with
this form of encrypted reply block.  They are really not secure unless
the body itself gets transformed at each step as in Chaum's model.

None of this is news.  We have been discussing these attacks for years.
Even with intra-remailer encryption I think these attacks work against
the remailer net.

> Is the message a clear set of ::Request-Remail-To:?  Pull & log.
This will work when the message is heading to the net in the clear, even
if it is encrypted between nodes.

> Is the message clear, with encrypted headers?  Match, pull, and log.
You can still match the message entering and leaving the net, even if it
is encrypted within.

As above.

Encryption with padding between nodes would protect against size
matching, I agree.  But it is the padding which is important, not the
encryption.

That's why Chaum identified one of the main features of a remailer being
that it would reject duplicates.  Mixmaster does some version of this,
although that needs improvement to really meet this attack.

OTOH, if Alice actually has signed those messages, her jig is up pretty
good, wouldn't you say?  Do we really want to force people to use the
nets in a mode in which they can be incriminated like this by a hostile
government?

Hell, Detweiler has the power to do this!  He's spoofed messages plenty
of times.  How do we know?  Because of remailer logging.  That's the real
threat, IMO (the logging).

Even if a message comes from a fake address that is hardly evidence of an
attack by a powerful opponent.  It could just be an extra-paranoid
legitimate remailer user who doesn't want to extend any more trust than
necessary.

I meant to refer to encrypted messages identical in size and otherwise
opaque, so that your apparent rate of output is constant.

I was referring specifically to the correlation attack described by Wei.
The other attacks you describe need to be met by the kinds of
countermeasures we have been discussing: standard-sized messages,
remailer chains, not using encrypted reply blocks which leave message
bodies alone, rejecting matching messages.  All of these were discussed
in Chaum's 1981 paper.

How can Bob arrange to receive a constant number of messages each tick?
Do all his messages come from one remailer?  Or do all of the remailers
which might send to him check among themselves before sending to him so
they can mutually know how many fake messages to send?

IMO the real solution to the correlation attack is to have a constant
message generation rate.  That is sufficient.  Solutions to the other
attacks mentioned in Chaum are described in Chaum.  (This attack was not
described in Chaum's paper.)

I'm not sure what you mean by "matching the top of the body of messages".
Are you referring to an encrypted reply block, which might be the same
for two different messages to the same user?  Or are you suggesting that
messages would have some headers or some other structures at their top
which would be preserved through a remailer?

If the input to Bob really can be made constant across the whole remailer
net then this does seem to largely protect against duplicate-message
insertion, in conjunction with the intra-remailer encryption.  However it
would apparently also be necessary for every remailer to send a constant
number of packets to every other remailer.  Otherwise a bolus of
duplicates into one remailer would all leave to go to the next remailer
at once and would show up.  This means that the net as a whole has to
carry a constant traffic load on all inter-node links, which could mean a
large cost in bandwidth load.  I still think that rejecting matching
messages is a better solution.

No, of course message size standardization is a necessary step.  This has
been recognized for 15 years.

OK, but chances are your average number of real packets per tick is < 1,
e.g. if a tick is a few hours and you only send one or two messages
a day.  So when you do need to send that 500KB GIF it's going to take a
lot of ticks.

I would sum up by agreeing with several points: the need for standard
message sizes, and for a standard rate of message output.  I am neutral
on whether a remailer may want to super-encrypt a message to the next
link in the chain (whether a remailer or an end user) if it happens to
have a key handy.  I don't see any harm in this and the remailer
software will already handle this transparently on the receiving end.
I disagree with the idea of remailers checking signatures.  I don't
agree that inter-node remailer encryption provides significantly more
protection than padding.  I think that encrypted reply blocks are
unsafe even with inter-node remailer encryption.  See Chaum's paper for
ways that encrypted reply blocks can be used safely.  We have also had
some suggestions here for modifications to Chaum's method.  And I don't
see how you can arrange to receive a constant load from the net without
a highly centralized system, which would have its own dangers.
