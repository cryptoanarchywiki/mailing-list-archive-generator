Gee, fellas, looking over this bill, *most* of what's going on is
just porting existing telephone law over to cybercomm. Given the
existence of 900-sex-talk, the phone companies are clearly not being
held responsible for content.

They are required, of course, to cooperate when complaints of 
harassing or obscene calls are made, to obey properly warranted 
requests for wiretaps, etc.  It's perfectly reasonable to expect 
similar requirements on net service providers.

Yeah, but First Amendment and common carrier law is a morass of 
conflicting statutes, interpretations, and case law.  After all, 
libel law puts some content liability on newspapers [too much, IMHO, 
but it has hardly destroyed freedom of the press].

As several posters have noted, the placement of the key words 
"knowingly" and "intentionally" are critical.  It doesn't appear, 
though, that any "knowingly"s or "intentionally"s have been removed.  
I am forwarding copies of this and the whole bill text to my brother, 
the former DA in Telluride, to see if he sees any unusual craptraps.  
I'll post any useful reply ...

I.e., *just like with phones,* you can't send harrassing or obscene 
messages to unwilling recipients.  Is there a lot of slack for 
bullshit?  You betcha!  A major change from the present?  Doesn't 
look like it.  [no intention of holding up the present as paradise, of 
course  ;-]
