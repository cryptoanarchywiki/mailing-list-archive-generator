I'm doing some archive maintenance at long last.  Be warned, you can't
upload right now because of some mystery configuration error that I
can't fix myself.

What I'm asking about are some files that were not uploaded with
descriptions.  I'll delete them in a week or so if I haven't got mail
indicating what they are.  This list is at the bottom of this message.
(Yes, some of them are quite old.)

Note that the archive maintainers have their own address now (see
header).  Please use it for all archive maintenance mail.  And please
read README.UPLOAD if you're going to upload in the future.

Eric
