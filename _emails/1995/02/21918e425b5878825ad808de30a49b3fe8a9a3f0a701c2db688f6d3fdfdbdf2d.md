Well folks, I've been on the list over a year and haven't seen a get
together for those of us in MN. So being the masochist that I am, I'm going
to try to put one together. Granted it won't be nearly as elaborate as those
in the Bay area, but it'll be a start.

Tentatively:

Date: Saturday March 4, 1995

Place: Applebees - Calhoun Village Shopping Center, Minneapolis

Time: 5:00pm 'til they throw us out.


This may change, depending on how many (or how few) respond. Let me know if
you are interested or have suggestions. This also will be a good
opportunity for some key signing too.


Sam
