Just got done watching it (and I have it on video tape.) In a nutshell, 
Senator Exon was much more convincing than Mr. Rotenberg. :( Why didn't
EPIC field someone with better debating skills? A sellout was offered a 
la EFF and DT. Mr. Rotenberg seemed ill prepared and not really 
interested in the issue. This is not a good omen. The perseption left in 
my non-internet literate wife was that the INTERNET=smut. :(

All in all, not a good showing IMHO,

Sam
