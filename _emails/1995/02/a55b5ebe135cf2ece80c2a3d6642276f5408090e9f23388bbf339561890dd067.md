	A few weeks back Matt Blaze posted on top ten problems we
face.  I'll add two to that list.  First is our inability to
accurately assess the strength of various government agencies.  We
tend to make very pessimistic assumptions, which tends to be safe, but
having real data on which to base our assumptions would be better.

	The other problem we face is that people like Matt write solid
essays on various things, and no one responds.  People who write
essays, post solid mathematical results, etc, bemoan this pretty
regularly.  Fortunately, this problem is easier to address.  Try to
spend more time on the posts which people took longer on.  Its usually
obvious which those are.  The reason to spend more time on solid posts
is that someone took the time to write well on something.  If they get
solid feedback, they'll do more solid writing, and the quality of
discourse goes up.
