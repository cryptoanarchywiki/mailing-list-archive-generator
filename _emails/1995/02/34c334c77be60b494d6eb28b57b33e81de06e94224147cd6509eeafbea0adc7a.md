A version of this FAQ with Message-ID <01050105.hhv9l1@arch.ping.dk> was
posted from Stodolsky's machine in Denmark on 17 Dec 94 by
judges@arch.ping.dk to news.admin.* and misc.legal, asking for feedback
and asking for no distribution restrictions.  IANAL, but it looks to me
like your genie's out of the bottle.
