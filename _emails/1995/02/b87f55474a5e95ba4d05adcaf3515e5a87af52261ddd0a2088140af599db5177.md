I found this on another list that I"m on.  I have no connection at all 
with the distributor, but I thought that it would be interesting to share

1.  New Publication: PRIVACY & GEMS: HOW TO AVOID THE PRIVACY INVADERS
We all have something to hide, right?  From nosy neighbors, burglars, our
spouses, private detectives, but most of all the government and business.
In this 38-page booklet, you will  learn how the government and business,
through the extensive use of super-computers, is compiling data on ever
facet of your life.  Discover exactly how they do it.  The amount of
information kept on you is astounding: bank statements, investments,
credit histories, medical records, school transcripts, driving histories,
videotape rentals, retail purchases, tax returns, legal records, and more!
This booklet explains who is collecting information on you and what they
are doing with it.  Your dossier is compiled and sold without your
permission or knowledge.  Find out what technologies are available today,
and their frightening implications for tomorrow.  We are on the verge of a

what they are and how to go about protecting yourself from the privacy

will not be discovered.  Subjects covered include:
Why Privacy?, Political Persecution, High-Risk Business, Divorce, Probate,
