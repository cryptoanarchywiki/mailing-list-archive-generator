No, it doesn't "destroy" it. PGP just needs a redesign to pass along
DNSable tags (like joe@some.domain.org) with keyIDs.

No one is proposing throwing it away. People are proposing small
changes to the format.

No, we aren't going to do that, because its an administrative
nightmare, and I can't imagine proposing such a thing with a straight
face at an IETF meeting.

No, it doesn't. Archie is a piece of shit that can't find what I need
about two thirds of the time and is slow as molasses and cannot
scale. It was a nice idea but its at the breaking point.
