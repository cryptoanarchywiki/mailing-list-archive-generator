     From Edupage:
     
     TO BUNDLE OR NOT TO BUNDLE? THAT IS THE MICROSOFT QUESTION 
     One of the fears Microsoft rivals have is that Microsoft will build 
     directly into the Windows operating system various applications 
     software packages (such as encryption for financial processing over 
     the Internet), because customers would be reluctant to pay for 
     products that do more-or-less the same thing as an installed product 
     that they get "for free." Although it's unlikely that the government 
     would consider breaking Microsoft up into separate companies, it is 
     conceivable that it could force Microsoft to limit what it includes 
     with its operating systems. (The Economist 1/28-2/3/95 p.61)
