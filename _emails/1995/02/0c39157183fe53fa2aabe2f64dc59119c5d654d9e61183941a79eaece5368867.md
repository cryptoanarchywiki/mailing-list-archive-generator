The NY Times report today on the near miss of "terrorist 
mastermind" Yousef in Manila after a kitchen blaze of 
cooking-up explosives, says that he was seen walking rapidly 
away talking on a cellular phone.


Allegedly left behind on a laptop was a disk "filled with 
details of his plots to kill Pope John Paul II, and to blow up 
American jets flying in the Far East."


Twenty (20) FBI agents were sent to pick him up in Islamabad, 
Pakistan for safe home in the New York.


A concerned citizen may ask:


What was picked up from the phone, or will be affidavited to 
have been picked up.


What was on the disk, or will be solemnly sworn to have been 
found on the disk.


And, finally, what armament and intergalatic technology 
accompanied the SWAT team -- over and back, to provide full 
cloak and security on land, sea and air?  And, with that show 
as spoof, how was he really imported?  How many other fake 
transports were set in motion?


When will we learn more of the lurid Clancy-juicy details of 
this black-op budget-busting crowd-pleaser?


Is this a laptop dog and pony?  No offense to Fifi and Holy 
Bull and Apple.
