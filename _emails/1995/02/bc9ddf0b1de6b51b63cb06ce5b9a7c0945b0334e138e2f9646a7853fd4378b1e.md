Yes, but as long as _one_ remailer in your chain is not compromised by the
NSA, and if that one remailer has high enough traffic going through it and
does the proper things with reordering and latency and such (a big "if",
currently), you're still safe.

That turns out to be the whole purpose of chaining, since it has been shown
that it doesn't neccesarily make traffic analysis any harder.  The purpose
is to hope that at least one link on your chain is both honest and properly
working.  Yeah, if all the links on your chain are NSA-sponsored, your in
trouble.  Nothing that can be done about that.
