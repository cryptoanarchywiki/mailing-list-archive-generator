Some version of this discussion came up a few months ago, and I passed on
it then, but I think I've heard enough to comment now:
 
The remailers are based on an inherently different model than the InterNet.
Some of these differences, in fact, are crucial.
 
1) The InterNet is based on mutual cooperation/mutual trust.  Cypherpunks
   trust no one that they don't have to.
 
This is not just a result of our twisted psyche.  If we could trust
everyone, we wouldn't _need_ remailers.  Since we don't even know who is
whom out there, we avoid extending trust.
 
2) The InterNet is concerned first about reliability, and not at all about
   privacy.  The remailers are concerned first about privacy, and can leave
   reliability to the users, if need be.
 
There is nothing to prevent Alice and Bob agreeing to send each other ACK
statements, and retransmitting messages if they don't get the ACK.  There
has been some mention of remailers doing the same with each other, in an
attempt to improve net-wide reliability.  BTW, with T1, sending ACKs is not
unreasonable between remailers.
 
3)  From 1) and 2).  The remailers are heading towards mandatory PGP,
    possibly nested.  All InterNet messages are world-readable--although
    this may be changing as the model breaks down.
 
Again, this has to do with the intrinsic diffences.

Here we have the real head of the problem, as Hal so asutely points out:
in your model, if the first remailer is bad, the message is compromised.
If user encrypt to all remailers, they might as well encrypt directly to
mole@snakeoil.nsa.gov.  If they don't, they severly limit who can pick out
their messages.  In particular, they bypass transient remailers.
 
But that isn't all.  If the remailers pick the route, they are in a no
better state than the users.  Since the flushing attack requires remailers
to operate on ticks, with carryover, an hour delay per remailer is almost
minimal, untill traffic really picks up.  So if some message routes through
four remailers, a minimum of four hour delay results.  In your case, this
could easily move between in/out of service modes.

Stupid is as stupid does.

NOT TRUE.  With proper use of encryption, you are trusting your first
remailer only to not reveal that you sent a message, and not to correlate
that message to the one it sends out.  With rational use of garbage running
two deep, you can even suffer this loss without significant harm.

How indeed?  The reason we chain is because we _don't_ really trust our
first remailer--or any other.

remailers to the user--with an exception list for those not "live".
