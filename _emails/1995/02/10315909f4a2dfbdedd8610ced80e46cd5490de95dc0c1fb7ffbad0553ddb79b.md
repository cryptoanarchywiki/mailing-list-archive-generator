    A very interesting claim.  Care to tell me what my "false claims" are,
    or is it a secret?

One is your claim that ``"X-" headers have nothing whatsoever to do
with MIME.''  This was in response to my suggestion that such headers
were MIME-compliant.  As I said previously, unless you are claiming
that MIME violates the RFC which you referenced, then these headers
are MIME compliant, as I suggested, rather than completely seperated
from MIME as you have suggested.

The other is that I ``have no idea what [MIME] is''.  I may not know
as much as I should, by your judgement, however your claim is still
incorrect -- presumably you were more interested in being
inflammatory than accurate.  Not completely out of place here . . . .

Really, there was nothing very secretive about my previous or current
presentation of the problems with your claims.  For example, you might
note that the first one that I list is simply a rewording of the
message to which you most recently replied.  What was it that was
unclear the first time?  Or *are* you suggesting the MIME violates RFC
822?  Or perhaps I'm just missing something subtle in your reasoning.
If so, could you elaborate?
