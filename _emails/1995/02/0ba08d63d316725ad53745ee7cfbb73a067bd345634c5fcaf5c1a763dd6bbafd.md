THUS SPAKE Network Security Observations <NSO@delphi.com>:
# Henry,
# I would like to publish the working doc. in the next available issue 

Go ahead; I place the document in the public domain.

# of Internet Security Monthly. Obviously with a request to respond.

It would be kind if you sent me a copy of the issues that discuss it.
I'm not familiar with the journal.  If it's on paper, ask for my USPS address.

# Do you have any further material that you prefer to go along with it ?

Nope, that says what I have to say right now.  

The followup discussion on Cypherpunks has been helpful to me;
the punks mostly made good points and correct observations.  


		best regards, strick
