Perhaps you're right. Your argument here, as I see it, is that web-of-trust
becomes _more_ functional as it becomes adopted on a larger scale. This
might end up being true and it might not, although there seems to be
no evidence as of yet of increasing "connectivity" of signatures as PGP
becomes more widely used, which was the point I was trying to make. The
unresolved question is whether or not there will be a critical point at
which the web will become widely connected. The answer does not seem at
all clear to me.
