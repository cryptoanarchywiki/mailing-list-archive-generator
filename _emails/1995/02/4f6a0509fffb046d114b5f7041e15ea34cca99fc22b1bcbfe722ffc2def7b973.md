    Instead of routing all of those messages to /dev/null, forward
    them back to the authors, perhaps with a notice that the message
    appears to have been mistakenly routed to you?

And then all LD has to do to have lots-o-fun is to send you a whole
bunch of "your OS sucks" messages with the From: line set to
alt.religion.scientology@some.mail2news.site . . . .
