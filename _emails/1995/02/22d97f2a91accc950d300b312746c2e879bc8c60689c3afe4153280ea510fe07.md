Aye, there lies the rub. How exactly does one determine if a site is
active or generate a current list of active sites? It is not enough to
ping the site or even to successfulyl deliver mail to it: the fact that
something is alive and running sendmail does not make it a remailer.

Likewise, a remailer cannot select an alternate site on behalf of the
user if the routing is chosen by the user, as each "envelope" is
encrypted specifically for a given remailer. I suppose one could develop
client software that built several redundant "envelopes" for alternate
mailers, but that would get out of hand pretty quickly, both in terms of
the effort of generating a secure message and in term of the size of a
message.

Scripting is useful (hell, the ::Request-Remailing lines are effectively
a script) but not until there is data to operate on.

Not a bad idea, actually.
