     From Edupage:
     
     ONLINE SPYING
     While you're connected to your favorite Web page, it's also connected 
     to you, and could be copying all sorts of information off your hard 
     drive, say industry experts. In fact, it happened last year when 
     Central Point Software used registration software developed by 
     Pipeline Communications, and inadvertently also gathered descriptions 
     of the users' systems -- the type of microprocessor, the version of 
     DOS and Windows, the type of display and mouse, and the amount of free 
     space available on the hard drive. Customers squawked, and Central 
     Point had Pipeline change the software. However, Pipeline reports that 
     at least one of its clients is using the scanning feature now -- but 
     only after getting the owner's permission. The lesson? "If you can't 
     trust it, don't connect to it." (Forbes 2/13/95 p.186)
