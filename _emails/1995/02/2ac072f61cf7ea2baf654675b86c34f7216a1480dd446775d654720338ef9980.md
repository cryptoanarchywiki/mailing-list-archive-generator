I was actually contemplating going a bit further, and making the core
message not a "text/plain" but a Message/Rfc822, but without a "From",
or perhaps with a "From: somethingfictitious". I also wouldn't declare
the contents to be a multipart -- rather I'd have them be a security
multiparts container that in turn contained a multipart containing a
remail commands section and another security multipart...
