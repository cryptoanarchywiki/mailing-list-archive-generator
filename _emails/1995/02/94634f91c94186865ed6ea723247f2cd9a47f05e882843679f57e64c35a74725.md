hal sez:

: Perl does exist for ms-dos, and I think those scripts would probably work
: OK there.  They don't do anything exotic, just some byte reads and
: writes.  Maybe the random-number generation would need to be looked at;
: as I said, that is the one weak part. But probably they would work OK.

kool . could you please repost the scripts , i seem to have misplaced them.
also , where can i get perl for dos , any idea ? tia .
