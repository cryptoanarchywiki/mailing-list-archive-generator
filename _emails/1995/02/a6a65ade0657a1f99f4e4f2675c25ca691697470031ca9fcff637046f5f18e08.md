        Instead of routing all of those messages to /dev/null, forward
        them back to the authors, perhaps with a notice that the message
        appears to have been mistakenly routed to you?
 
    And then all LD has to do to have lots-o-fun is to send you a whole
    bunch of "your OS sucks" messages with the From: line set to
    alt.religion.scientology@some.mail2news.site . . . .

Presumably, this sort of censure would occur very rapidly.  The script had
specific from/to lines it was looking for.  Neat idea, though.
