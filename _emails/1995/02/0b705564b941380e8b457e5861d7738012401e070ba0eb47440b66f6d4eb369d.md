It is a reasonable bet that all data into the home will come on
cable systems which means they require encrytion anyway.. there
are bridged, not point-to-point...

And other traffic like mobile voice and data will use some RF
technology...  which also requires encryption...

Existing cable systems are now running 1 gigahertz of bandwidth and
I had presentations from TW staff indicating 2 gigahertz is easily
reachable.. 

Figure 2 gigahertz of bandwidth (split between analog and digital
services) in each neighborhood and a ATM switch pulling those signals
back to the "head-end/central office" via fiber, and you have the
cable system of the future.. (e.g, for the next 5 to 20 years)..
