The text of S.314 (the pi bill, as Doug pointed out to me earlier
today -- why I didn't realise earlier...) is available at
	http://baldric.resnet.cornell.edu/frodo/s.314.txt.html
with a rapidly hypertextified version of Slowdog's text on what
the bill will do to American law at
	http://baldric.resnet.cornell.edu/frodo/s.314.changes.html

   If there are errors or omissions, please tell me. If the URLs
are wrong, the failsafe is my homepage,
	http://baldric.resnet.cornell.edu/frodo/frodo.html
which has links to both. (Really. They're there. There's some
bumf about me. But the links are there.)

This may be useful to some. I find it handier to have it there
than in an odd text file lying around here.
