Strictly speaking, you've really only demonstrated
that there are a lot of poorly connected sites on the USENET.  The
primary characteristic that really needs to be considered is the time
for news to reach one remailer site from another.

My experience is that new propogation is fast enough that close to
real-time conversations happen all the time.  I take part in them on
the newsgroups I still read and observe them all the time.

I don't have a ready explanation for why my experience differs so much
from yours.  The worst-connected site I've ever read from was 9 mo.s ago
with a batched feed from uunet.  Even then the vast majority of posts I
saw were from the day just ending.

What are other people seeing as news delays?
