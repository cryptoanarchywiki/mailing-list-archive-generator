I don't think paranoia has anything to do with it. I just expect people to
do the job that they are supposed to do. IMHO Mr. Rotenberg didn't do his
job as well as he should have. I saw numerous opportunities to score salient
points and he didn't. What Senator Exon says and what the bill says are two
different things. I got the feeling that Senator Exon didn't even understand
the ramifications of the bill. The unfortunate part is Joe Blow on the
street isn't going to read the bill. He's going to rely on what he has
heard. In my opinion Mr. Rottenberg didn't correct Senator Exon forcefully
enough. The consumate politician triumphed.
