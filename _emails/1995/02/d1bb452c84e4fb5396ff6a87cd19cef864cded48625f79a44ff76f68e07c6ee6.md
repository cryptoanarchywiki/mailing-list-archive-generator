We had some concerns here a while back that someone was trying to exploit
such a feature to create an exponentially-growing message that would
totally overload the remailers.  A message of the form:

::
Request-Remailing-To: <list of remailers here>

::
Request-Remailing-To: <list of remailers here>

<repeat about 20 times>

was sent.  If all remailers had observed and honored the multiple
requests, there would have been uncounted trillions of messages flying
about.  So I would caution anyone considering implementing this feature.
