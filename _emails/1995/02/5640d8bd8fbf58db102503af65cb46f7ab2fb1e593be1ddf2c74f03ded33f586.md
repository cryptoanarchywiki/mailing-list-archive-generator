true. thanks for the reminder of seals. i need to work this analogy into my
current 'lecture' on the usefullness of encryption.

_puzzle palace_ makes reference to british intellegence making use of people
trained into the use of people trained to reproduce seals. this is something 
for us to look out for from the fine folx at nsa. if there is a way to spoof
signatures (as mentioned in another thread recently), they will be perfecting
and perhaps using these methods if they feel the need is great enough.

i promote encryption using pgp with a lot of stress on the privacy and
veracity of documents in business settings. 

how strong is the hash used by pgp? do you think it will eventually be
hashed out in the courts in our favour?(pun semi-intended)
                                  
i'd like digital signatures w/verifiable timestamps be recognised in a
court of law. i don't know of any cases revolving around this issue.
if anyone out there knows of one, i'd be interested in hearing of it
so i can track it's progress.

btw: though it is a pain sometimes to weed the noise off this list due
to my (very) limited net access, it has proved to be an excellent
resource. my thanks to the regulars.
