Minor point: the NCOA data is only available if you have the previous
address.  Mailers submit a list of name/addresses to an NCOA contractor
(severly limited in what they can do) and if there is a match with the
address supplied by the mailer, the address is updated.  You cannot
just call them up and buy mailing lists.
