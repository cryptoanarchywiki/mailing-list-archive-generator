Ugh. This has been a stupid week. Oregon House bill 2319 was introduced
by Rep. (Kevin?) Mannix on 1/16/95, and referred to the House committee
on Commerce on 1/18/95. Rep. Mannix has also introduced another bill, 
HB 2310, which "Creates the crime of electronically furnishing obscene
material to minors; punishes by maximum one year imprisonment,
$10,000 fine, or both." HB 2310 was introduced 1/13/95, and referred
to the House Judiciary committee on 1/16/95. 

He's introduced 38 bills so far this session - including others re
mandatory minimum sentencing for felony convictions, one which appears
to bar surrogate-pregnancy agreements, and another (HB2303) which 
prohibits physicians from performing artificial insemination on an
unmarried woman.

Damn this fucking state. I'll be on the phone with my representative
in the morning to see if I can find out more. Westlaw's legislative
tracking database doesn't have much information.
