Of course, that's more useful for MIT, which owns Network 18,
than for the thousands of people on networks 192.xxx.xxx;
reverse lookups don't seem as reliable for Class C.
On the site I run, I implement reverse lookups for my subnet,
and the folks who run our larger internal net have pointers that 
know how to find it.  But DNS would work for forward lookups
even if the reverse weren't maintained, or deliberately omitted 
some parts for security/predictability reasons.
