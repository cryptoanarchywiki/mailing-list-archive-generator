Apologies if I repeat a question which has already been answered.
My only gateway onto the Net is very expensive, and I miss many
important postings.  Some time ago it was asked why Vernor Vinge
made passing reference to humans' naivete in trusting public key
encryption, and some posters were seeking to contact professor
Vinge for clarification.  Has any further explanation been 
discovered for his distrust of PKE?
