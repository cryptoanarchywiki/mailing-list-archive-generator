With Mixmaster, everything is hidden inside the encrypted and ascii armored
message structure.

I use the :: token to let the remailer know that this is a remailer message
of some sort. The Remailer-Type will eventually be used to indicate the
version that created the message. It would be easy to add support for MIME.
It would just replace the token and version number.

All remailing instructions are inside the ascii armor.
Note that the block of ascii armor is allways exactly the same length.
