Well, I have no idea why you think that MIME is an "atrocity" or
"slime", but it is perfectly clear that you have no idea what it
actually *is*, since "X-" headers have nothing whatsoever to do with
MIME.  The "X-" headers are defined by RFC 822, which has been the
standard for Internet mail formats since 1982.

Perhaps you should learn what MIME is before you embarass yourself
further.  -- Nathaniel
