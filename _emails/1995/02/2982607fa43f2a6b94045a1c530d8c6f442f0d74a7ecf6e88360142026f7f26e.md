Actually, tunneling through a telnet connection on an application-level
firewall does have its place, especially when the firewall's
granularity of authentication is designed only to bind authorized
people to telnet connections.   This way, the firewall need only
enforce a very simple access control model (which is easier to
verify is working correctly) and need make very few authentication
decisions on a per-packet basis.

The down side (which is why I don't do this myself) is that you
have to be careful that the external end of the tunnel does not
forward IP packets from the rest of the net and is otherwise
reasonably secure, or one such connection is enough to eliminate
any security benefits the firewall might otherwise have offered.
It's not clear there's much a telnet firewall can do to prevent
tunnels, however, so we might as well at least make them secure as
we can.
