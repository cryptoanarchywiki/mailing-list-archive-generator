Try turning Word Wrap off in Eudora.  I was encountering the same thing in the Windows version of Eudora.  With Word Wrap on, it seems to add CRs (or CR/LFs on a PC) to the end of each line upon sending.  This obviously causes a message not to match the signature, since all of those CRs weren't there when you composed it.  With Word Wrap off, your text still wraps on the screen when you're composing, but those unwanted CRs in the sent mail don't get added.
