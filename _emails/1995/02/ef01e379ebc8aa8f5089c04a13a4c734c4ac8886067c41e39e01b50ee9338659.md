This appears to be an appropriate point for me to extend an offer
to scan any cypherpunk material for this list and/or achives that may
be appropriate. I have a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet IIcx with the
Automatic Document Feeder attachment, and Caere's OmniPro OCR software,
as well as Microsoft Office and WordPerfect 6.0.
