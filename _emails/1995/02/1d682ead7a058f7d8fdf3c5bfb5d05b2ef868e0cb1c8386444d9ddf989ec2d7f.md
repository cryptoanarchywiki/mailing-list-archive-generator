I'm not sure that thousands of remailers will ever exist.  There will 
be little incentive for people to use small remailers, which, because 
of their low traffic, add little untracibility per additional unit of 
latency and monetary costs compared to larger remailers.  Larger 
remailers will also likely have better reputations for 
trustworthiness.  The economics seem to indicate that (if a market 
of remailers is ever established) there will be a small number (less than 
a hundred) of large remailers that are well used and profitable, and 
a larger number of small remailers that are nearly never used.

Remailers don't seem to be a good way to access the WWW, which is 
much more efficient when done interactively.  On the other hand, my 
proposed Pipe-net would seem to be perfect for this, and other 
communications that need both untracibility and low latency.

P.S. People are more likely to respond to things they don't agree 
with (as I did here).  If you write something and no one responds, 
it probably means that everyone except the lurkers agree with you, so 
take it as a good sign.
