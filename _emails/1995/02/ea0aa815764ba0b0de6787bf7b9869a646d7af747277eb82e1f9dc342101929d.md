Firstly, I certainly do not propose that we remove user-supplied
chaining; it is obviously vital to true anonyminity. What I am
suggesting is that we allow remailers to introduce more noise into the
mix using information that users cannot easily obtain for themselves
(e.g. which remailers are in operation at this moment). In the
apparently common case of unencrypted messages crossing the net, this is
at least no worse than the current situation. Of course, we would also
have to allow users to specify that no munging of the route be allowed
(some form of scripting). Trusting remailers to obey this request
requires no more trust than we already place in them (which, I believe,
is considerably more than most seem willing to admit).

If you succumb to the temptation and trust remailer #1 totally, then you
of course run the risk of sacrificing anonyminity. However, if you do
not trust remailer #1 so completely and specify a chain of remailers,
but allow remailer-generated routing between the points on that chain,
you gain resistance to traffic analysis as well as making it possible
for smaller transient remailers to play a useful role.

I don't see what would prevent this from happening now. The only degree
of cooperation I require from remailer operators is that they agree on
some software standards and that, if they choose, they create extended
webs of trust via signing one another's keys. There is no requirement
that all remailers or remailer operators trust all other remailer
operators; in fact, I think this would be undesirable, even if the trust
were justified.

Again, remember that control lies with the user. If you choose, you can
allow a remailer to bounce your mail through its web of trust before
forwarding it to the next point on your chain. I do not believe that
this increases the risk of losing anonyminity. I do also propose that
this be the default behavior in order to provide naive users with some
degree of security, as well as using their traffic to obscure that of
more sophisticated users.

True, all true (I seem to be saying this a lot today). My transient
remailer problem can be solved by publishing the times of availability
(assuming, of course, that my remailer will always be up when
scheduled). My only serious objection to this is that there will always
be more clients with more operating systems and platforms than there
will be servers. I don't expect that it will be easy to create new
standards for remailers and get significant numbers of operators to
implement or use them, but I do believe that that task is easier than
making smart clients available on all possible platforms.

This is a fine suggestion; as I mentioned in an earlier message,
scripting is not useful without data to operate on. You have suggested a
number of data that a remailer could usefully provide to a message,
making scripting more useful. Of course, you have to trust that the
remailer is not lying to your script.

[ More Safe-TCL comments and a plea for smarter clients rather than
smarter servers, to which I reply with the earlier argument, deleted.]
