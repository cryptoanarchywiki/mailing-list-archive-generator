It seems to me that if a user maintains a 24-hour a day pipe to an 
uncompromised server, then the method I described earlier against 
remailers should not work against that user.  Otherwise, some kind of 
in-out statistical analysis may work.

See Verner Vinge's _True Names_ for a fictional description of a future 
where real time anonymous interactions are possible.

This is certainly true.  The system Vinge describes is almost a 
pipe-net.  But he didn't say anything about link encryption, without 
which the system can be trivially broken.

I haven't responded to the comments you made about the similarity between 
pipe-net and ATM, mostly because I'm not very familiar with ATM.  But 
as I understand it, ATM is based on forwarding fixed length cells, 
whereas pipe-net is based on fixed-bandwidth link encrypted streams.

Spamming, and flow control shouldn't be problems, since all users 
of a server will connect to it with pipes of the same bandwidth, so it 
can just accept a certain number and then stop.

Bandwidth limitations will depend on how fast the server CPU can do 
the encryption and decryption.  With LESM at 100 cps, each connection 
took 2% of the CPU capacity of a Sun 4-CPU(90Hz) 4/670MP.  Of course, 
I made no consideration for efficiency when I hacked ESM, so this can 
probably be decreased quite a bit.
