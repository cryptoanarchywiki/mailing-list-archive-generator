I think the jury is still out on that. Web-of-trust is still really
untested because of the difficulties in widespread deployment of
PGP. As it stands, PGP is still a hacker's toy -- the lack of a
library or an easy to use global key distribution infrastructure mean
that we have yet to see what can be done. I think that mutually
authenticating organizations with small trust pyramids within the
organizations, but without a global key pyramid, may come to prove
very practical.
