 We have the usual 2nd Saturday (March 12) meeting planned, but I
 *definitely* think cpunks should do something around the cfp
 conference.  last year we did an informal in-the-hotel-halls meeting,
 but since this cfp is in the bay area....  I propose keeping the
regular March and April mtgs, and adding a cpunks dinner &&|| BOF at
cfp.  other ideas?

 ps CFP is March 28-31, at the sf airport marriot in burlingame ca.
