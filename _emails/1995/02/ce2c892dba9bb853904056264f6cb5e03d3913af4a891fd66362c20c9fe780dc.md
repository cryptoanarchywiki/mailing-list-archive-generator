I had the USENET model of propogation in mind when I wrote this.  Delivery
is considerably better assured with such a store-and-forward over

True, if you append "for extended periods of time."  The key detail is the
boundary condition: IE, how long does it take a "downed" remailer to come
off the web.  Since each site has the best idea of their own stability,
they are in the best position to set the time-out period.  A very flaky
site might set a time-out to 6 hours.  I'd suggest that a site flakier
than that shouldn't be running a remailer.

No, not at all.  The attempted connections to your sendmail with fail and
the mail will attempt redilvery for some period of time (usually 3 days) 
at a certain interval (usually 30min. - 1 hour).

Sure.  It's important to note that you've got two seperable problems to
address here: 1) a recurring limited window of up-time, and 2) handling
permanent down-times.

My suggestion only covers the first.  The USENET model I'm pushing is
designed to cover the second.

Absolutely, that's what I was trying to express.
