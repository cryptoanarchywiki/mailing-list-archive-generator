Well, in the long term, my hope is that people use IPSP for this. It
will mean that the kernels on their machines simply deal with all this
stuff and that userland applications get to ignore it 90% of the time.

And the telnet; however, it has a library to let you do whatever you want.

In v5 there is more general support, I believe.

Thats really an interface issue, I think -- they have a lot of the
fundamental stuff down. If thats one's only complaint with Kerberos (I
have others) the "right thing" is to build a simplified administration
system.

Thats quite untrue -- passwords in kerberos are set by the users, not
by the administrators!

You only need ISODE for the ASN.1 compiler; you don't have to build
the whole thing.

There is swIPe, and the derived TIS product. Its a bit primitive since
it doesn't handle per-socket keying. There is stuff that I'm hacking
on between flames -- its going to be called swIPe II. It will conform
to my RFC drafts and should run out of the box on any 4.4BSD
system. I'm hoping people will back-port it to SunOS and the like.

There is also SSL, which is what the Netscape people are pushing --
stands for Secure Sockets Layer.

There is also the thing this guy Andy Heffernan did a draft on in
which you do this at the TCP layer; he uses a TCP option to pass IVs
and MACs.

There is also the method proposed by the AFT working group at the
IETF, a.k.a. the "socks" working group, for encrypting sockets.

There is also the thing that Miron Cuperman wrote for YTalk. It did
diffie-hellman key exchange followed by an encrypted session.

There are about three or four more that I can't bring to mind at the
moment but I'm damn sure I've seen them.

Diffie-Hellman doesn't give you real security without some sort of way
to authenticate the exchange. Man in the middle gets you. You are then
down to either using signed exchanges or some sort of challenge or
conventionally keyed way of authenticating.

BTW, Kerberos most emphatically does not require active
administration. I've run it in an environment with thousands of hosts
with narry a person paying it any attention.

Well, this is an admirable goal. Of course, the Netscape people want
to do the same thing with SSL, and others have proposed to do it, too.

Ultimately, the thing that is going to fix the net is IP layer
encryption -- anything at a higher layer can't really fix all the
problems reliably. (As an example, consider RST attacks against TCP
connections.) It also can't fix them pleasantly.

Meanwhile, of course, it is going to be a while before that stuff is
universally deployed. My reference implementation isn't going to be
here before April. It will be freely available, but it will only run
on some architectures, and it is unlikely to be idiot friendly or
perfect out of the box day one.

Understand, also, that as one of the few people here who writes code I
don't want to discourage you from continuing by any means!

However, I'd say that this isn't going to be a permanently deployed
thing on the net -- that much we can be pretty sure of.

Probably people aren't that enthusiastic about them. Encrypted
sessions are in wide use for telnet and the like -- I do that sort of
thing regularly, and now that session stealing has become a fact of
the net I suspect that S/Key is going to vanish and be replaced by
various encrypted telnets. SMTP it doesn't make much sense to protect
because what you really want to protect is the contents -- i.e. via
PEM, MIME security multiparts, or some similar method (I favor PGP'ed
secure multiparts myself.)

Why? Why not just do the original calls? If you are trying to overlay
shared libraries, just rename the calls in the symbol tables or
relink the library or something similar...
