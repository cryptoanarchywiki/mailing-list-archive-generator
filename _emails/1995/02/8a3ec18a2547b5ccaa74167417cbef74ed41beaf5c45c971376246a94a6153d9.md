This reminds me of a joke I finally grew tired of, prescient though it may
have been given current legal events in Tennessee:

        It's illegal in Cambridge to smoke in Boston...

Most non-smokers, especially the reformed-smoker non-smokers, didn't think
that that one-liner was very funny. Most small-l libertarians had a hoot or
too about it though.  (Just like the punchline about how many radical
feminists it takes to screw in a lightbulb [A: That's really *not* funny.])


I guess I'll sit down now...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
