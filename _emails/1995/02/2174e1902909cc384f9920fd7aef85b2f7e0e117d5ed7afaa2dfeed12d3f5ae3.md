But not impossible.  According to Kahn, the Austrian Black Chamber was
quite adept at forging seals in the late 1600's / early 1700's.  They
were able to take sealed correspondence in at 7 a.m., unseal it, copy the
message, re-seal it, and have it back in the postal stream by early
afternoon.  There was only one recorded case of them re-sealing a message
with the wrong seal, and that was because the seals were so similar.

All this is from memory, since I don't have my copy of _The Codebreakers_
here at work, so I may be off in some details.
