Saw this in technomads. Not necessarily crypto, but certainly privacy related...

Cheers,

>More recently, I've become interested in sending and receiving

>and WebCar -- radiocar on the WWW).

>I would like to hear from any other ATV hobbyists, people into
>packet radio, and those interested in wearable cameras, and
>combining wearable cameras with wearable computing.  Another
>application I was interested in was wearable vision (e.g. for
>the visually impaired, or simply to augment the regular human
>visual system).
>
>Therefore, I've started a new mailing list, ``netcam@media.mit.edu'',
>to discuss issues related to wearable cameras, as well as communications
>and computation issues associated with wearable cameras.  I am also
>interested in some of the privacy issues associated with wearable
>cameras (as I touch on in http://www-white.media.mit.edu/~steve),
>and the social implications of a society in which there are
>ubiquitous cameras (both wearable and fixed) connected to various
>high speed communications networks.
