Better than looking at sources, look for the file rsa.doc avail. from a lot
of crypto/security ftp-sites... specifically something called the MD5-A RFC
...? It explains the algorithm pretty well, and is what I used to write my
own assembler implementation with... better to work from an explanation of
the algorithm than from sources which you may or may not understand what is
going on.
