RUPERT'S BIG PLANS Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has big plans for his
Delphi Internet Services -- he wants to boost it from fifth to first
place in online service providers. "Internet, Delphi and TV as it
becomes interactive, all will become very much integrated," predicts
HarperCollins' publishing VP. By choosing existing software modules,
such as Mosaic, instead of developing its own graphical user
interface, Murdoch hopes to leapfrog the competition and come out on
top.

Delphi's data encryption technology will also enhance its
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
position among privacy-conscious consumers. (Upside Feb.'95 p.39)



Anyone know anything??
