I have uploaded a fixed version of both secure edit and source code to
ripem.msu.edu in the directory pub/crypt/mac.

I have also uploaded a 35k patch that will update your b0.5 to b0.6.

There are also some other minor bugfixes rolled into this b0.6 update.

Again, sincere apologies for the bug (it was my fault), and I earnestly
hope no data was compromised by it.
