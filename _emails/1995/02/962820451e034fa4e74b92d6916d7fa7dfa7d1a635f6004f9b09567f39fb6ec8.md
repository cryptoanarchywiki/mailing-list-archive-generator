The Computers, Freedom, and Privacy Conference is to be held 29-31
March 1995, at the Marriott in Burlingame, CA (SF Airport). Details
have been distributed recently to most of the usual places.

I'll be on Michael Froomkin's "Crypto" panel on Friday, 31 March.
Along with Stewart Baker (ex-NSA, famous for "Clipper opponents just
getting revenge for missing Woodstock"), Steve Walker (TIS), Phil
Karn, a Microsoft guy, and maybe others. Details should be available.

So I'm all for a Cypherpunks BOF ("birds of a feather," in case this
term is new to you....basically, a special interest group gathering)
or dinner. Maybe more than one?
