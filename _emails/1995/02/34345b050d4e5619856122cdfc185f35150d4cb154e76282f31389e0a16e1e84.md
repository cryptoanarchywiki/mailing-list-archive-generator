No, you got that wrong. You do a lookup on 101.1.151.156.IN-ADDR.ARPA
-- note the component reversal. The reversal is very key.

No. Its fully distributed. The fact that networks are assigned in
heirarchical chunks should explain how its done, and why the bytes get
reversed for the lookup. As an example, MIT owns network 18, which is
to say that all MIT addresses are 18.XXX.XXX.XXX, and 18.IN-ADDR.ARPA
is a server at MIT. MIT may have sub-servers beyond that level, but
DNS makes us oblivious to this.

For IPv6, the reverse lookup is going to be segregated at the nybble
boundaries rather than at the byte boundaries because of CIDR style
classless allocation. The domain will be IP6.INT rather than IN-ADDR.ARPA
