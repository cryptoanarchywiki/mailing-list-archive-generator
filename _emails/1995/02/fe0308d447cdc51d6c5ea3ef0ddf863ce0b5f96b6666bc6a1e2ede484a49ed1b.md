The Adleman paper is on the web (I put it up).  The url is:

	http://www.hks.net/~cactus/doc/science/molecule_comp.html

I never completed typing the perspectives article since an article
appeared in Science that implied that Science doesn't consider it kosher
to reprint their articles.  As a member of the AAAS, I'm a bit appalled
by this position but for the moment I've stopped any progress on
entering Science articles into the Web.

Enjoy,
