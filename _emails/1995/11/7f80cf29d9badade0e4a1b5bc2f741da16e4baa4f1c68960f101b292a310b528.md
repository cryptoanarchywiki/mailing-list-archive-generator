[sorry for the delay, things are busy here, and apologies too for the 
length of this thing...]

Misunderstanding, piled on misunderstanding, piled on disagreement.
I'll try to focus on the big points, and let the small stuff slide.
Let the record show that Prof. Junger and I still agree on lots of stuff 
that's outside this debate.  I wasn't trying to attack him before, and 
I'm not trying to start a flamewar now.

Main point for the busy:  Claims that the US government could apply the 
ITAR to 2 foreigners abroad and get a US court to buy it are, IMHO, 
unfounded.

Here's a misunderstanding (for which I'm happy to take full 
responsibility).  What I meant by the "ultra vires" point is this:
There are lots of ways in which an agency action can be struck down by 
the courts.  Two of them are:

1) The agency interpreted the statute correctly, but the statute was 
unconstitutional -- beyond Congress's powers under the constitution.

2) The agency interpreted the statute Incorrectly, and tried to do 
something beyond the powers delegated to it by congress (the nice thing 
about this is that one doesn't even reach the issue of whether Congress 
could, in theory, have delegated the power in question).

That's what I meant by my ultra vires assertion.  Type (2) above.  So we 
agree in a sense as to what this problem is -- but I call this a case of 
an agency misconstruing the statute, not a "separation of powers" problem.

Let's assume, for the argument, that I'm wrong and that the agency read 
the statute reasonably (note under Chevron it doesn't have to read it 
"right" just reasonably).  

Does the agency read the statute to apply to two foreigners talking on 
the beach at Calais?  No it does not.   

Did Congress intend the statute to be applied to the two foreigners?  No
evidence that it did. 

Would or should a court read the statute to apply to two foreigners etc.
in the absence of a clear direction from Congress to that effect? No. 

Why not?  Two main reasons.  One is the one you identify:

> Congress lacks jurisdiction under international law to pass a
> statute--or authorize a regulation--that makes it a crime for a

The other one is that even if Congress had the jurisdiction, the court 
would be reluctant to read the statute that way, with the implications 
for foreign relations, comity, etc etc without clear directions to do 
so.  And if you think the court would just formalistically follow the 
words of the statute, see eg Church of the Holy Trinity, 143 US 457 and 
its progeny.

I cannot imagine that the court would do anything but dismiss on these 
facts.

There are a number of other arguments he could make.  E.g. denial of due 
process for lack of notice.  Unconstitutionality of the statute as 
exceeding the powers of congress as a violation of international law.  A 
weaker argument would be an analogy to the ex post facto clause -- now 
the government seeks to apply its laws to him after the fact.  I do not 
think that the Neuremburg precedent would be contrary, since the claim of 
the US there was that some laws of man and nations are always in force 
everywhere.  Restrictions on crypto exports does not fall in that class.

A vast and unhelpful oversimplification.  what do you mean by "such 
cases"?  Criminal prosecutions of US citizens for messing in foreign 
policy is one thing; criminal prosecutions of foreigners for acts that 
have foreseeable effects here is another thing; criminal prosecutions on 
the facts above is a whole different thing.

It is certainly true that as Justice Jackson put it, the powers of those 
branches are greatest when they agree.  But the constitution trumps all.

I do not agree.  See above.

But no.  First there is the constitutional arguments.  Then there is the 
idea that we interpret the statute to avoid the constitutional and 
international problems.  Then there is the problem that there are no 
grounds to think that Congress ever intended to reach foreigners in such 
cases (and Holy Trinity Church, 143 US 457 (1892) still gets cited 
(despite its anachronistic view of religion)).

I think many district judges, most appellate judges, and almost every 
supreme court justice would at least reject, if not laugh at, that 
argument.  The trend is away from assertions of jurisdiction over 
foreigners without minimum contacts, e.g. Asahi (sp?).

I'm sorry, but everything that follows the line above is irrelevant.  If
there are other grounds to prosecute, the court will use those and avoid
the constitutional problem.  If the foreigner isn't really foreign, then
he's not a foreigner.  I'm going to respond in detail anyway because I
think that the FUD factor may be coming in to play...

I don't see what dual criminality has to do with this.  Am I supposed to 
be on notice that if I do an illegal thing here to my neighbor, I'm 
supposed to be at risk of prosecution in Sri Lanka?  Anyway, recall that 
in the original hypo foreigner A is talking *legally* to foreigner B.  
Even if they are not, it's not within the competence of the US 
government to do anything about it.  Nor -- I have to say this over and 
over and over and over -- has the US government ever asserted in any form 
that it would seek to do anything about this.  Just because an 
over-literal reading of a regulation could lead to that view does not 
equal an actual assertion of jurisdiction by the government.

Not relevant.  Note, by the way, that on these facts the "export" was by

Not a foreigner, or the export is traced to a non-foreigner who then is

I invite you to consider the recent decision of the 9th circuit that 
foreigners in the US have full 1st Am. rights.  Of course, the position 
of the would-be enterant is not the same as the position of even the 
temporary visitor to our shores, since constitutional rights don't attach 
to foreigners until they are in the country, but the language of that 
case is very suggestive.

Yes, litigation is expensive.  The foreign person unjustly excluded on 
this hypo will spend the time at home, writing crypto for profit, and 
reducing our tax base.  Meanwhile academic lawyers such as us will be 
representing her free of charge.  The government is sometimes unjust; 
even when you win against it you are worse off often than if you hadn't 
had to fight.  That's a wholly different issue from whether you win in 
court, which is what I thought we were arguing about.

Speak for yourself please.

I do not accept this accusation.  I assert that my "solution" to the
"problem" of whether a court would allow a criminal prosecution of a
foreigner, however "evil", for discussing crypto with another foreigner in
a foreign locale absent the most explicit and direct instructions from
Congress is the correct one: probability near zero.  Direct, clear
instructions from Congress supported by a legislative history or
legislative findings that made it clear that this was a result Congress
intended would raise the probability considerably, but I'd still bet on
the court striking the statute down as violating due process.

The academy is part of the real world.  All so-called real world questions
are fit subjects for academic study.  Much of my work is inspired by
concrete problems, or is (I hope) applicable to them.  Some of my work is
more abstract.  They applications are less immediate.  I'm proud of that
too.

It at least as dangerous to believe that a court will formalistically

constitution, were a mechanistic process.

This is a fair point.  The facts *do* matter.  This is why "hard cases 
make bad law."

But the fact that you can do so is part of the reason why rubber hoses are 
less common than they would otherwise be.
