   that's a given. NIBM (not invented by ME) syndrome.  That is what 
needs to stop. however, Sun has been playing the game recently of 
introducing an early product, then coming on with a more standard product.

   that does not change the fact the twogroups need to talk, and someone 
needs to coordiante resources.  Nothing wrong if SKIP shakes out a few 
details as they implement, but then it needs to go to the standards.
