Urk, that reads very badly what I ment is that since a different
public/private key is used per session, if a private key is revealed, any
previous and future comunication between the 2 entities is not
compromised, only the particular session using that public/private key pair.
Also since the key pair is generated on the fly, they don't need to be 
recorded on disk etc, so they only way to get the private key is to 
'hack' the application at runtime (or modify it in advance).
