Colleagues:

The New York State Archives and Records Administration (SARA) has
acquired four significant electronic data sets generated by New
York State agencies, including the Department of Education and
the Department of Correctional Services.  To enhance access to
the data sets, SARA is conducting a survey targeted at
researchers who use machine-readable data and statistical
analysis for their work.

A high level of participation in this survey would be very
helpful. If you would like to participate, please contact:
