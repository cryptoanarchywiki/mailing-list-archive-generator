Depending on what you think of the strength of those algorithms, the 512-bit
mod p system may not be strong enough.

The *strength* of 512-bit mod p DH systems is only about 56 bits.  You need
1024-bit primes for a *strength* of 80 bits.

In contrast, the 155-bit elliptic curve in the Photuris draft has a
strength of about 76 bits.
