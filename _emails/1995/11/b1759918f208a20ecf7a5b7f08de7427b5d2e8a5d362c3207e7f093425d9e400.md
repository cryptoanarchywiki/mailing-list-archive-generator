Such a thing could exist, because Win95 allows you to save passwords that
use different encryption methods. Microsoft would say "no, doesn't exist,"
however, because this is a major security flaw. I haven't seen such a
tool, though. Anybody?

What you should do is get a real encryption package like PGP (poke
around on http://web.mit.edu/ or http://www.netresponse.com/zldf/, it's
free), use something that is long and complicated but that you will never
ever forget as your PGP passphrase, and encrypt a text file containing
all of your passwords with PGP. You can put other stuff like all your
credit card numbers in a PGP-encrypted file with reasonable safety too.
You (only) will be able to decrypt and read this file whenever you want.
