I'm not a programmer, but it seems to me that if the goal is to minimize the
"obviousness" of the provision for cryptography, the calling program could
call the called program (which might be an encryption program, maybe not)
and ask for a text header that is to be listed in a Windows-type window.
Thus, the calling program would not have any references to "encryption" or
"key" in its program or documentation; it would get that the first time it
calls the called program.  

BTW, one function which obviously  needs an additional argument to work is a
CRC program, in which the particular polynomial to be used must be
specified.  And I guess that a CRC is basically the same type of thing as a
hash function, too.
