As I recall, the courts have sent the message to the LE community that it's entrapment if they 
entice someone into doing something that they normally wouldn't do.  If you're a kiddie porn dealer, 
and I as a LE officer entice you to sell me some pictures of that cute 8-year-old doing some geezer, 
then that's not entrapment.  If I, on the other hand, try to pressure you (assuming you are a 
law-abiding citizen) into buying such by either misrepresenting the article in question or by 
threatening you with dire consequences if you don't buy, etc. - in other words, forcing or enticing 
you to do something you normally wouldn't do - *that's* entrapment.
