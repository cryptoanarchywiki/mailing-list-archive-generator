No, I don't think that, Mr. Jeffers, but I must admit that my opinion
is that random political crap (NOT careful announcements by the likes
of jya@pipeline.com of reprints of articles on the new FBI wiretap
garbage) doesn't belong.

I'm sorry, but you do a disservice to the cause of freedom. People are
trying to get work done to actually get cryptographic systems written,
deployed, and popularized, and the sort of crap that fills this place
periodically prevents people from working together towards that
end. If you want to talk about politics, go to Libernet or some such. 

Tim May will doubtless disagree, but he has nothing else to do in life
than read the net so his incentives to see traffic minimized aren't
the same as other people's.

Look, its simple. If you want the FBI and NSA to win, post lots of
crap here. Nothing will help them out more than clogging one of the
few communications channels available to people interested in
spreading cryptography. If you are really successful, all the smart
people will leave (as has happened in waves before -- the losses of
Steve Bellovin and (effectively) Phil Karn are still felt) and you
will have totally destroyed the channel.

If you want the anti-crypto people to win, nothing can help nearly so
much as your attitude. I'm glad to see what side you are on.
