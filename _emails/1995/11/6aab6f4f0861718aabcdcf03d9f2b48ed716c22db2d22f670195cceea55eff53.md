There is no such right in most (if not all) european countries. In
France there is not even the presumption of innocence.

The British Conservatives have recently passed a criminal justice
Bill which abolishes the right to silence and most other protections
for the defendant. They are busy writing another.

That is not to say US politicians are any better. Congress is busily 
rolling back on all the protections they can. Got to fill those jails
somehow you know.
