That would be a useful feature, even if it's just an unstructured text file.
There is a way to do it now, though it's inefficient and hokey -
create multiple key-signing keys, with name fields indicating the attribute,
sign them with your main key, and use the appropriate one of them to
sign keys for people.  For instance, I have a key named
"Bill Stewart Unauthenticated Pseudonym Signing Key <stewarts@ix.netcom.com>"
which I use to sign keys of significantly lower trust than my normal key;
you could do similar things for higher-quality certification.
This does increase the depth of the web-of-trust required, which is less
of a problem for low-trust keys than for keys you actually care about :-)
