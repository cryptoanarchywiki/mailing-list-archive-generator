The manpower shortage can be solved by moving the listening step offshore,
perhaps to one of the Carribbean islands that processes credit card slips.

Even cheaper would be to subcontract out the listening to the relatively
impoverished, but well-educated and English-trained, former Soviet bloc
nations. For example, Romania or Bulgaria, or even Russia. They may still
have the old listening infrastructure in place, although I hear that Stasi
headquarters in the former DDR is now an acupuncture clinic.
