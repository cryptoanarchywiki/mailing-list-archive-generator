Tim is of course right that network speeds are the problem.  However, the
network limit is the speed of light and not current network technology.  If
your bank is half-way around the world, the 1/7 second round trip will kill
any chance you have of offering 1/10 second response time.

For some thinking on the subject of caching cash, see the "Digital Silk
Road" paper accessable through the Agorics home page:
http://www.webcom.com/~agorics/

BTW - I don't think we should be talking about a penny/page cost because it
is way too high for the current market.  For example, my copy of Applied
Cryptography V2 cost about $.067/page AND came with the media to keep it
"forever".  My (used) copy of Snow Crash cost closer to a penny/page and
also came with the media.  I would think that somewhere between 1/100 to
1/10 of a penny/page is closer to the current market value of the page
content.
