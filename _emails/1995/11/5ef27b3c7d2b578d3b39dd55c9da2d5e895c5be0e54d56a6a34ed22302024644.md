I fully agree. I'm not arguing with you.

If you meant "disclaim that they are NOT speaking for the company", then that's
what I was saying too. Moreover, I think that if someone known to work for Sun
posts from Netcom about Sun products, policies, and future plans, s/he'll have
both higher credibility and higher responsibility to the readers than a
proverbial person from the street.
