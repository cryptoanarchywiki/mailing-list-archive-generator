Have you heard of time zones?

The first message, from Anonymous, was sent from the Replay remailer (in

07:20 in the +0100 timezone is of course 22:20 of the previous day
(Saturday) in the -0800 time zone.

Looks harmless to me.

However, there is increasing evidence the intelligence agencies have
managed to open up a portal in time, using the tachyonic devices being

ought to be enough to convince anyone in these paranoic times.
