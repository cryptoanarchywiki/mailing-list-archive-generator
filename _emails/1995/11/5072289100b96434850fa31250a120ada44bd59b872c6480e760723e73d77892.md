that might interest some of you sitting on some extra rEeal Money
who also suffer from the burning desire to find out what 
ideas and technology other folks are flogging on the talk-circuit.

        7.  How will debit and checking fit in with the electronic
            money future?
        6.  How do you balance privacy, security, and efficiency in 
            E-cash systems?
        5.  How can electronic commerce be used for a business
            advantage?
        4.  How will the government regulate E-cash?
        3.  How will electronic payment systems protect against
            fraud?
        2.  What infrastructure is needed to provide security
