Unfortunately, an internetworking protocol used by only one vendor
gets nowhere.

I doubt it. Ashar Aziz and company at Sun are pretty much
ego-committed to SKIP. Their group might not have nearly as much
justification for its existance without it. That probably makes them
reluctant to go in the right direction.

SKIP is really very alien from the direction most of IPSEC is
taking. It sacrifices a lot of functionality for the perceived benefit
of being able to send an encrypted packet to a host "without prior
negotiation". Unfortunately, that benefit turns out to be a mirage
because in any real network you would need to do a certificate lookup
in order to actually decrypt the packet, at which point you've lost
any advantage. SKIP requires all sorts of hooks into the ESP/AH packet
formats which makes it essentially incompatbile with ESP/AH
implementations. SKIP uses long term keys which could really hurt if
they were compromised. SKIP doesn't do perfect forward secrecy. I
could go on and on.

Ashar keeps answering every criticism with "well, you COULD do X in
SKIP if you just hung this kludge onto it, but of course we hope most
people would never do that".

I started with a lot for respect for the guys and lost most of it
through time. Ah, well.
