	They (as in, the government) has used the RICO laws against
Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion/pro-life (pick your term) group for
protesting/picketing abortion clinics and doctors who perform abortions.
If they had prosecuted under statutes which applied to everyone, I
wouldn't have had a problem, but they are going after OR and similar
organizations for using tactics similar to those used by civil rights
protesters in the 60s.  'Course, civil rights is Politically Correct.
Abortion rights is Politically Correct.  Protesting abortion is
Politically Incorrect, therefore illegal.
