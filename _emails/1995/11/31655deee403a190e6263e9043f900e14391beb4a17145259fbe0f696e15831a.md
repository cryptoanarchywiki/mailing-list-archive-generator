Sorry about taking so long to reply... I'll quote more than usual
to make up for it.

I was referring to the claim that the system is payer-anonymous.

Thinking of it again now, what's to stop Eve the eavesdropper from spying
on the proto-coins, running crack against it, and then (later) 
eavesdropping on the bank-signed coins and unblinding/depositing them 
before Alice/Bob does?

(No, being encrypted by the bank's public key is not enough.)

Yes, but is the bank really interested in protecting privacy?

a) It would be nice if the protocol didn't require this choice.

b) This choice should be made explicit to the user.

c) As I noted above, wouldn't it also strongly reduce security?


See you!
