I think we've discovered another potential nasty.
I accidentally sent out the SECRET key not the
public key. I believe the problem you suffered was
because it added it to secring not pubring.

No I'm not going to make the passphrase public. I
apologise for any inconvenience to people who
added this to their secring.pgp, it was certainly
not intentional on my part to do this to people.
You should probably delete it.

Greg.
