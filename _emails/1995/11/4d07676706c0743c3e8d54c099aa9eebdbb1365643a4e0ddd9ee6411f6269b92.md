In this case, I was talking about an abbreviation for an attribute
rather than for a person --  e.g.,

	"checking-account: <number>,<bank>"

standing, for example, for

	"The person (entity) capable of signing with the signed-key 
identified above is authorized to withdraw money from checking account
number <number> at <bank>."


However, in offline mail I just had this interchange:

>

>
>we could use:

>Signed-Key-ID: Carl Ellison (e05c601c4ec4af3aeb54a53171ed65da)
>

or

Signed-Key-ID: e05c601c4ec4af3aeb54a53171ed65da (Carl Ellison)

to follow the SMTP example, or

Signed-Key-ID: e05c601c4ec4af3aeb54a53171ed65da (Carl Ellison <cme@tis.com>)

to follow the PGP example.


In this case, the text attached to the key is optional -- but there for the
people who feel attached to their names.  It's left off (or replaced with a
handle) for folks who want anonymity.

The fact remains that the key is the source of authority here.  The name
acquires validity from the key, not the other way around, and that might
upset some people who bother to think about it.  However, those who prefer
to think the name is important can view the key hash as an added field
making the name unique -- with the extra added bonus of being tied strongly
to a public key.
