Where have you heard that? Everything I've heard from DigiCash seems
to indicate that no such "payee encoding" is performed.

It is possible though with other (teoretical) protocols, such as Chaum,
Fiat and Naor's off-line cash scheme (briefly described in Schneirer's
book 'Applied Cryptography') and especially the (off-line) cash system,
developed by Stefan Brands.

In these systems, when Alice spends a coin at Bob's shop she has to
respond to a random challenge, sent to her by Bob. This random challenge
could possibly be a hash of Bob's identity and some other values.
My impression though is that this is not a feature of the current
implementation of ecash.

It is conceivable to think of the above mentioned methods in that way,  yes
