Local cable TV companies *are* constrained re recordkeeping about
consumer choices and disclosure of that data - see 47 USC 551, the
"Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992".
They must disclose at the time you sign up for service and once
yearly what data they keep about your watching/purchasing choices, and
who that data is disclosed to. They must dispose of that data when it
is no longer useful for the purpose for which it was collected. 
Consumers get liquidated damages of the greater of $100 per day or
$1000, plus attorney's fees and (maybe) punitive damages.

But I agree that cable TV != DirecTV, and that Hughes seems to be
unregulated in this field.
