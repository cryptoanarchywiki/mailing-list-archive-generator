Actually, that's not true.  What's REALLY important to the government is
that it not be AVAILABLE outside the country, or perhaps even more
accurately, not available anywhere.  Problem is, the government doesn't have
unlimited authority in this area.

NO!  The government doesn't even pretend to have authority over non-exported
encryption, and they readily admit this.    And I'm sure they are also are
aware that they can't press their luck with an overbroad interpretation of ITAR.

Let's look at REALITY, okay?  Export controls on products have been around
for many decades.  Computers are a classic example.  If merely manufacturing
a product that (if exported to the wrong place) becomes a violation of such
laws/regulations, then practically every computer company that has ever
existed violated ITAR.

Here's the real "problem": Export regulations were intended to MINIMIZE the
number of controlled products "leaking through" the border.  There was never
any illusion that this could be entirely eliminated. So far so good: They
were happy to minimize the number of mainframe computers 1970 (for example)
USSR got.

Software, by its very nature, is infinitely copiable, which means that even
a single export  constitutes a complete failure of the system.  Thus, a
system of regulation that was useful for hardware becomes totally useless
for software.

No, it isn't.

No, he isn't.  Exporting a book on encryption, including algorithms, for
example, is entirely LEGAL.  

And I think you're misusing the term, "cryptosystem."  The government may be
attempting to use ITAR to regulate exports of fully-functioning software,
but it apparently cannot touch books containing source code for such
programming.  Thus, "exporting the cryptosystem" is NOT always a violation
of ITAR if your definition of "cryptosystem" is so broad as to include
source-on-paper, and thus your statement is legally irrelevant.  If you
tighten up the term "cryptosystem" to  include only functioning software,
your statement becomes false because said programmer does not need to export
same.

Note that I'm assuming that the programmer GENUINELY writes the software
abroad, as opposed to faking it.   Of course, even "faking it" might be
legal:  If source-on-paper exporting is LEGAL, then taking a copy of an
encryption program outside the country on paper, then scanning it into a
computer and recompiling there should also be legal.

That's not a satisfactory solution.  The goal, I suggest, is to allow
Netscape (or any other manufacturer) to sell a SINGLE product around the
world, without violating (even arguably) ITAR.
