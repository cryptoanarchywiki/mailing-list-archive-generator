	I put together an SSL/Apache using mostly other people's work,
but some of my own. It's available for beta-test to use non-commercial
to US-persons. See http://www.c2.org/apachessl/

	The README is attached.

	The release of Apache supports SSL, using Eric Young's SSLeay
package and RSADSI's RSAREF cryptography library. Ben Laurie
<ben@algroup.co.uk> wrote the interfaces to SSL within the Apache server,
which was developed by the Apache Group.

	This release of Apache-SSL is maintained by sameer
<sameer@c2.org>. For more information on sameer's releases of
Apache-SSL see http://www.c2.org/apachessl/.

	For more information on Apache see http://www.apache.org/

	For more information on SSLeay see

	For more information on RSAREF see http://www.rsa.com/

	Portions developed at the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This
product includes software developed by Ben Laurie for use in the
Apache-SSL HTTP server project.

	Use of this software is allowed for non-commercial use only,
as described in the RSAREF license. For information on commercial use
of this software, please see http://www.c2.org/apachessl/.

	This package is using Apache 0.8.14 -- not the most recent
version of Apache. While every effort will be made to keep this
package up to date with the most recent Apache version, that can not
be guaranteed.
