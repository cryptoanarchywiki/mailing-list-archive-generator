This sounds like a version of "Hey, I'll pay you $10, if you give me a ten
dollar bill first." As I understand your protocol, Bob gives Alice an enote,
then Alice gives Bob an enote. Alice isn't paying Bob in any meaningful sense,
since Bob ends up with the same amount of e$ with which he started. Perhaps
you could clarify what you meant.
