Hmmm.

If this is the cipher I've seen, it's not overwhelmingly impressive,
though it may be OK.  I haven't ever made any serious attempt to
attack it, and I don't know anyone else who has.  Anyone have a
reference?

Basically, GOST is a balanced Feistel network (like DES), but its
F-function is much simpler.  Basically,
F(X,K) = Rotate_Left(S(X+K),11),
where S(t) denotes parallel application of eight 4:4 S-boxes.

Depending on the implementation, these S-boxes' contents could be
key-dependent and pseudorandom, or fixed.  Unfortunately small
random S-boxes are likely to have some weaknesses W.R.T.
differential cryptanalysis.  This can be true even when the S-boxes
are secret and key-derived--see Biham and Birkyov's paper in
Auscrypt '94 on a DES variant with variable S-boxes, for a quick
discussion of this.  And the security of this scheme is very much
going to depend upon the S-boxes used.  If the S-boxes are generated
at (pseudo)random from the key, I'd expect there to be some pretty
nasty weak key conditions that could occasionally come up.

On the other hand, GOST is defined with 32 rounds, so it may be hard
to find any useful differential or linear characteristics, even for
relatively bad S-box choices, that have high enough probability to
get through 29-31 rounds.  And it has a 256-bit key, so even if
someone determines some attack which recovers 160 bits of the key,
there are still 96 bits of key left to provide security.

The GOST key schedule is really simple, though it avoids the most
obvious kind of related key attack.  I wouldn't be surprised to see
some interesting related key attacks be possible.  This is
interesting because there is also a hash function based on GOST--I'd
be pretty reluctant to use this without a lot of analysis.

I may be mistaken, but wasn't there some other internal organization
in the USSR that did cryptography?
