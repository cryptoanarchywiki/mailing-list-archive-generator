Postscript is often a better model for applications like WWW -
certainly more flexible than GIFs, and often smaller, for pictures
that are composed of drawings or text-like objects rather than
scanned photographs.  You don't have to worry about resolution
differences, jaggies, and ugliness - just compatibility and
security and memory consumption :-).  It's somewhat the difference
between X and NeWS.  I seldom print Postscript documents out;
I view them with Ghostscript, though lack of a non-HP printer 
affects this...   Viewing java docs on line, with the equations
written as GIFs (without even an alternate text eqn or fortran form)
is much tougher.

Yep.  If you've got something that limits itself to making marks
on virtual paper and modifying memory in well-defined areas,
that's probably good enough.  I'm hoping Java can do much the same job.
