I've heard a couple of media interviews (CNBC Equal Time, and NPR
Talk of the Nation).  It sounds like a good collection of issues and
scare stories.  Experienced people on this list might learn a few things
to round out the overall picture, but it's probably best for the general
public.  I hope it does real well.
