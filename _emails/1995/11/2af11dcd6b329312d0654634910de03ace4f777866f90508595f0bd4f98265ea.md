   Science, Nov 17, 1995:

   "Security Schemes Aspire to No Fuss System Protection."

      Because of the painful trade offs between security and
      usability that come with current protective measures,
      computer scientists have heen investigating new ways to
      detect and ward off intruders that present fewer
      obstacles to users and administrators. Two of the most
      intriguing directions announced at the Baltimore
      security conference were reported by researchers at
      Purdue University's Computer Operations, Audit, and
      Security Technology laboratory (COAST). The first was an
      attempt to harness techniques from artificial
      intelligence to detect intrusions; the second, a pilot
      test of what has been called software forensics -- an
      effort to recognize malign programs by identifying the
      fingerprints of their creators.
