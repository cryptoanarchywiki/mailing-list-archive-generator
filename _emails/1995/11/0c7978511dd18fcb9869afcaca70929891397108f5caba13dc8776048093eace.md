	Some may have already seen this, but the Guardian Angels are trying to
intrude onto the net... and are doing so in typical clueless newbie fashion.
See the CUDigest web site for more information; the links to the most
significant issues are:
http://www.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/CUDS7/cud786 and
http://www.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/CUDS7/cud791. Some interesting commentary
is also in http://www.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/CUDS7/cud787. Incidentally, one
way in which they are displaying cluelessness is in taking L.Detweiler
seriously.
