      Who were systematically arrested, beaten, teargassed, wiretapped,
and even occasionally shot at. I *know*--I got firehosed, beaten,
arrested, and wiretapped for what I did. That's why I'm a Cypherpunk now.
      OR has received far better treatment than the civil rights
protesters ever did--or did I miss the news items reporting that Terry
Randall and Ralph Reed had been assassinated, and that their lieutenants
had been bumped off in black-bag jobs, and that their colleagues were
chained down to chairs *in court*?
