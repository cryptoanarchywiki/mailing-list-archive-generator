Not at all.  When a wiretap goes up, agents listen to every call that 
goes to or from the phone.  If the call doesn't relate to anything 
"criminal," they must "minimize" the interception by not listening.  They 
can listen again after some minutes to see if the topic has changed.

The pre-wiretap minimization conference for agents is taken very 
seriously by ethical prosecutors (not an oxymoron for those who ask).  
Good agents (ditto) also take the briefing seriously.
