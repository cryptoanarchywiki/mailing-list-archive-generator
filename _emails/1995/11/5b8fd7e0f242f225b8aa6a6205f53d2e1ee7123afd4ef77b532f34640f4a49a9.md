Various treaties provide that various privilleges will be granted to various 
citizens of the countries concerned. Do the treaties grant such privilleges in 
this case? Just because there is a treaty on nuclear disarmament between the US 
and the USSR does not mean that you as a private citizen can press for 
enforcement through the courts if you think that the USSR is not performing.

Perry used the phrase "lobotomized mongoloid judge" I think that this
type of language is offensive and unnecessary.

Ad hominem is a perfectly valid form of argument where one is considering
the reputation of the person making the statement. I don't think that 
the type of language and tactics Perry uses reflect well upon him. What is
"I am starting to have trouble believing you are a lawyer." if not ad 
hominem in any case?
