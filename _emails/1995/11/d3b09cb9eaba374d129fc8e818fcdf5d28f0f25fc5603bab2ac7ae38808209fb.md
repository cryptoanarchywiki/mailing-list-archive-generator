I have often found and come across considerable problems using a 
passport, local or foreign, as identification.  Many estlablishments 
simply refuse to accept them, as if they are inferior somehow to the 
non-standardized frequently forged allmighty driver's license.  This is 
mostly ignorance and a lack of common reference, as few americans 
actually HAVE these documents, or have even SEEN them.  (No, I'm not 
kidding).  I found this particularly distressing in D.C.  To some degree 
it's institutional, where recording a "drivers license number" on some 
form becomes problematic for the $5.50 and hour clerk who can't find the 
field "driver's license number" anywhere on the passport.

While I just take my business elsewhere when that is possible, I think 
it's interesting to note how desperatly people cling to the social 
security number and completely inept identifications like state issued 
licenses as if to let go would mean a decent into the bleeding hell of 
anarchy.  (In its popularly assumed and feared form)
