I do little posting these days on Usenet. There is almost no sense of
"community" there, in the sense of persistent, memorable posters, and in
the sense of even _slightly_ having similar goals and aspirations. A vast
number of the posts on any topic come from people who just rolled off the
turnip truck and who have no interest in learning.

I've assumed this for many years. One used to be able to buy "Usenet on
CD-ROM"...before the volume got to be too high. I've always assumed that
archives would be increasingly available, eventually covering the entire
history of Usenet, going back to the early 80s, and with tools for tracking
the changes in login names over time (so that, for example, Perry's 1984
postings could be easily retrieved).

Dossier services are coming, of course. If not legal to operate in the
U.S., trivial to locate offshore. ("Employers, we will provide a scan of
prospective employers. We can let you know if potential employees have ever
posted to alt.drugs, alt.homosexual, alt.deviancy, or alt.cypherpunks.
Avoid needless risks.")

Huh? What makes you think "alt" is not archived? Just because DejaNews
doesn't index it doesn't mean it is isn't archived in various places.

Paul Robichaux pointed me to another searcher, http://www.excite.com/,
which _does_ index the alt groups. I'm sure more are coming, reaching
further and further back in time. (At the rate the Net has been expanding,
by the time they can archive-and-index the last year of Usenet, they can
get the entire history for not much more. I'll bet this happens by the end
of 1997.)

I offered the "Blacknet Dossier Service" a couple of years ago to the
Extropians list subscribers. Nick Szabo helped me out by claiming to the
list that he had purchased his dossier contents, and was "shocked" by what
he found. A number of the Extropian list subscribers were quite perturbed
before I told them it was a joke. Then I pointed out to them that there is
absolutely nothing which stops such things.
