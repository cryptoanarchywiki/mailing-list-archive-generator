Hmm. Not only is this law unenforceable, it is unenforced. Anyone,
non-US or otherwise can buy crypto books - you just can't get the code
on floppy. Bruce Schneier went through this procedure when he CJ'ed
"Applied Cryptography".

\begin{lighter_note}
The illegal bit about (for instance) the munitions T-shirt is that it
has a bar code. _This_ makes it illegal for export, because not only is
it machine washable, it is machine readable.
\end{lighter_note}

Academic exchange of mathematical knowledge has never been under scrutiny.

"Technical data" will have to be interpreted to mean somethiing different,
like details of the inner workings of militart encryption equipment and the
like.
