I can't agree. The model of a successful enterprise includes feedback from
different levels of participants. Regardless, the government will be taking
a role in encryption. Thus even if they aren't a defining part of the
development, bringing them to a limited extent into the loop, and finding
even small areas which the government would support, helps provide better
buy-in by the government officials who participate, helping the momentum.

The point isn't to bring them into the design, but simply to use their
feedback to optimize our PR approach.
