Thanks for the newbie correction.

In case anyone else is new to this, I couldn't find that paper, but Chaum's
ideas and references are at http://www.digicash.com/publish/sciam.html

True. But until digital technology becomes ubiquitous, we're stuck with
it, and it does help. I see no analog, well, analog to credential 
technology. It absolutely requires machines that can generate and handle 
large random numbers. Right?

My point was, even people who should know better, like the managers and
clients of FBOI (fboi@netcom.com), are relying on security through appeal
to irrelevant crypto authority, which is even worse. Using your primary
pgp key as a traceable link to your credit card number or bank account can
be just as bad as publishing your credit card number.

I haven't yet fully digested this concept, but don't you get into a bit of
a chicken-and-egg problem when you start applying this to things like
proof of age and citizenship? Until you reach a certain age, you're not
going to remember your passphrase. I still think there's a role for
private keys held by some authority (I realize that's not a popular word). 

I'd guess this would be addressed by a "secret sharer"/secsplit kind of
thing, where your parents hold a combination of keys that together can
represent your secret key until you're old enough to change it yourself. 
Still I'd worry about what kind of information was gathered about me in my
youth, and how that might be carried over into maturity.
