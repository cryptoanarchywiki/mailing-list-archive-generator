The tamper-proof (more correctly, "tamper-resistant" or
"tamper-responding") hardware is so that attackers do not alter the clocks,
as one example, to "speed up" the time release. Or grab the key, as another
example.

(Cranking up the clock speed may or may not be possible and still have the
device work, but it's still an attack to consider.)

If the attacker can grab the internal state of the device, he can of course
run the "transform" talked about above on his equipment.

You'll need to more carefully argue your thesis. I cannot imagine a method,
save perhaps for quantum computing techniques, which can avoid the need for
"secure secrets," either via a person keeping a secret or a box keeping a
secret.

If the box is not secure against tampering, and an attacker gets in, he
effectively "knows" all of the secrets.

BTW, the "launch into solar orbit" scheme that has again surfaced here is
just a variant of making the costs of an attack very high.
