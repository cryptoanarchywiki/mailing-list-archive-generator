Peter Lewis reports in today's NYT on "doubts about the fantasy 
of a $500 'Network PC' " but quotes Eric Schmidt of Sun saying, 
"They will exist and they will be very successful, and not just 
from Sun and Oracle. The price points are going to be pretty 
low, and they'll look more like consumer electronics."


Anybody want this mixed review send us a BOX_top.
