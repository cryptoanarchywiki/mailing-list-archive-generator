The reason we speak in terms of physical volumes of "Adleman computers" is
to make concrete the way things scale. If the amount of Adleman computers
needed to factor, say, a 2000-digit modulus (or some reasonably equivalent
Hamiltonian cycle problem, such as the TSP) is "ten Pacific oceans full of
them running for 100 years," then one has a pretty clear feel for just how
futile it is to ask about "But what about if we apply MASSIVE
PARALLELISM?!?!"

(There's a certain well-known person who frequently raises the issue of
"massive parallelism" on sci.crypt, each time revealing that he just
doesn't understand that 1024 or even a million processors will not "solve"
the problem for brute force attacks. Some people think there is something
_magical_ about "massive parallelism.")

I don't worry much about factoring breakthroughs. And I don't mean minor
improvements, which keep occurring: I mean major breakthroughs which would
make factoring a 2000-decimal-digit number "easy."

Practically speaking, snarfing private keys is a helluva lot easier, for
many reasons.
