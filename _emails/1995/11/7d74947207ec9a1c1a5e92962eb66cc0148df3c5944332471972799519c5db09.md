What's important to the government is that the crypto not be exported.  If
Netscape did this, the government might try to take them to court to make
an example of them, or might leave them alone to support the information
superhighway, or might refuse to ever buy any Netscape, or whatever.  The
point for Netscape is than none of these are good for the corporation.

Maybe their executives don't want to deal with the possibility of going to
jail and are staying far from the edge of the law.  Maybe they are too busy
trying to find some way to make money.

But why would they want to risk this? As squeeky clean as it is, we now
all know that they know that making it available this way is exporting
it.  It's also possible that one of the people who took part in it would
turn State's evidence, or that this would result in a loss of
shareholder confidence, or that the people running Netscape support the
government position, or even that they just don't want the controversey.

This is illegal as well.  The programmer is exporting the cryptosystem,
and may even be guilty of treason (probably not).  If you really want
strong crypto, just buy it fom one of the hundreds of legitimate
overseas suppliers.  If you want to export strong crypto Netscape,
rewrite Netscape outside the US.  It's not that complex a program.
