You are making the same erroneous assumption that Phil made when he
designed the Web of trust:  You assume that it is important and 
interesting to link key ID's to physical bodies.  This is usually
not the case:  Linking key ID's to home web pages etc is not only 
easier -- it is also usually more interesting and important.
