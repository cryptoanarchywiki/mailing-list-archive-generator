  If the signature is padded with random junk on the end, then it makes 
it harder to do a known text attack.  There was a message a few days ago 
by Anderson and someone else (in England) that dealt with weaknesses in 
some encryption protocols.  It was good to read.

  Even though he didn't have proof Bruce Schneier stated in "Applied 
Cryptography 2nd Ed" that the NSA might have a machine that can crack DES 
in 15 mins, and maybe as low as 3-5, as one was built and sold.  The book 
can explain it more, as I am doing this from memory.
  Take care and have fun.
