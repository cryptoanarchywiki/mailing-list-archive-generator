Here's your chance to protest ITAR and 
whatever other CPUNK thing you feel worthwile.
Enjoy!


CONGRESSIONAL MAILBOT SERVICE

This service is provided to make it easy for you to get your message to
all members of the House or Senate that have E-Mail mailboxes.  By sending
a single message to the service addressed at HOUSE@MAILBOT.COM and/or
SENATE@MAILBOT.COM, your single message will be expanded and resent to all
members of those specified houses as if YOU had E-Mailed each and everyone
of them yourself.

Any E-Mail responses to your inquiries will be sent directly back to your
own E-Mail box.

WHERE DO I SEND MY E-MAIL TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN?

In order to use this service, you need to address your E-Mail to one or
both of the addresses listed below.

FOR MEMBERS OF TU          House@Mailbot.com
FOR MEMBERS OF THE US SENATE:
         Senate@Mailbot.com

WHO WILL RECEIVE THIS E-MAIL?

Your incoming message is sent to all currently known members of congress
that have E-Mail mailboxes.  The Congressional Mailbot System updates it's
list of members of both the Houses every 30 days.  At that time, new email
addresses are added to the Mailbot Server.


WHAT TO INCLUDE IN YOUR MESSAGE?

Most members of congress do not have the staff to deal with replies via
both regular mail and E-Mail.  Most would prefer to reply to your specific
request by way of regular postal mail.  In order for them to do that, you
need to include your NAME, ADDRESS, CITY & STATE so that they can send you
a response.


WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE IN YOUR MESSAGE?

Basically, your message should be short and to the point.  It is not wise
to include large amounts of text from other sources.  If you want to point
out to them about such sources, simply tell them where you saw it.
Imagine getting hundreds of email messages containing the same material
over and over.  The meaning gets lost.  Make your message clear and easy
to read.

WARNING

Each member of the House or Senate which receives a message from you via
the Mailbot, will respond with a reply message.

           THIS CAN GENERATE A LOT OF EMAIL INTO YOUR MAILBOX.

If for example, at the time you send your request to the Mailbot, there
are 130 members of the specific house you select, you will get back 130
reply messages from those members when they receive your message.
Currently, the automatic replies are about 750 bytes in size and only
contain a header with no message body.

These replies are sent to let you know that the Congress Person you sent
the message to, has received it in their E-Mailbox.

Some users use systems that only allow so much email per month for free
and then charge for email sent/received after that!


IF YOU CANNOT HAVE THIS AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC IN YOUR MAILBOX
PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!


WHAT IF I WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO A SPECIFIC Congress Persons?

THEN YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS SERVICE!  This service is for E-Mail intended
for ALL members of the House and/or Senate.  Individual messages to
specific Congress Persons should be sent by other means.


LIMITATIONS:

This is a very popular tool....  Several rules need to be enforced to
ensure that this service does not overburden the systems that are
connected to it.  The following rules are in place...

    1 The Mailbot will reject any message that is larger than 5,000 bytes
in size.  This provides you with a total of 66 lines of 80 columns per
line for your message which is a whole page of information to make your
point.

    2 Please limit usage of the mailbot to no more than one message per 72
hour period (one each to HOUSE and SENATE is ok).

    3 Abusive and obscene messages violate the purpose and spirit of this
service and WILL place the originator of such messages on a rejection
list.

Users who cannot abide by the above limitations will be placed permanently
on a rejection list and all further attempts to use the service will
result that user's messages being rejected by the service.

PROBLEMS OR QUESTIONS?

If you have any problems or questions about this service, please direct
them to the following E-Mail address:  Mailbot@Mailbot.Com

TELL A FRIEND?

If you should tell a friend or colleague about this service, PLEASE
INCLUDE THIS MESSAGE.  This will save them time in knowing what is
permitted and will keep questions about the service down to a minimum.


This Service is Provided By:
                       MAILBOT SERVICES OF ARIZONA
