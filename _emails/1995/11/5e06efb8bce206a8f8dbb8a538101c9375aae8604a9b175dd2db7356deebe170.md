But with complete anonymity, no player knows who else is playing, let
alone who won.  So if you were going to pay off yourself, you may as well
just pay off no one.

The idea behind my proposal was that any participant can determine if he has
won.  The winning number (a hash of which was published beforehand, as in
a "bit commitment" scheme) is announced.  Anyone who picked a number
that, say, matched in the last digit, wins $2.  If you matched the
last two digits, you win $10, etc.  The house (without sacrificing
reputation) can't arrange who the big payoffs will go to, nor can it
(as I think Tim suggested) give out lots of small prizes and no big ones.
