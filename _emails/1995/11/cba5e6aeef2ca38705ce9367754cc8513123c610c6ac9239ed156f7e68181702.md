To clarify my earlier post, although both of the latter two algorithms
have a runtime of the form exp(c*n^(1/3)*(log n)^(2/3)), for GF(p)
c=1.922+o(1), for GF(2^n) c=1.405+o(1).  This seems to imply that if 
GF(2^n) is to be used, n needs to be 2.56*log p to achieve a comparable 
level of security to using GF(p).  (2.56=1.922^3/1.405^3)
