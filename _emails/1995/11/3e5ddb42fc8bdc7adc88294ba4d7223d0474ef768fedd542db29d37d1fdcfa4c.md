Unfortunately, the technology's appearance is distinctly angled toward
the anti-hero. One, because the benefits are more obvious to the
anti-hero; and two, because the abuse of technology gets better press
than its use, particularly in the get-tough-on-crime era.

I've read only fictional accounts about the 3-person cell. Any
pointers to nonfiction material? "Tradecraft" didn't seem to be the
magic keyword in the local card catalog.
