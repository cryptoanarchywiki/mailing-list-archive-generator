You need a similar "mind bending".  "Feeding in non-random data"
doesn't lead to the driver thinking it has "plenty of randomness" left,
since it doesn't increase the entropy level to counteract the decrease
from the entropy-sucker.

The hard part would be having the driver figure out how much entropy
it's getting from the input.  "Non-random" implies some sort of
correlation between the bits.  I can't think of any way of measuring
that which doesn't make some sort of "horizon" that a malicious user
can confuse.

The simple mechanism would be to assume that input from untrusted users
adds no entropy, forcing entropy estimates to represent a lower bound.
