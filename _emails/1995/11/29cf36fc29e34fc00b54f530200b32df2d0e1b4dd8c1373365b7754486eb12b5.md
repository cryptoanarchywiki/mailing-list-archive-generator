The IEEE p1363 group's working draft on elliptic curve standard may help 
you here.  You can find it at ftp://ftp.rsa.com/pub/p1363/draft/ec.ps

One reason for confusion about the speed of elliptic curve cryptosystems is 
the small number of implementations.  A paper in Crypto 95 claimed that 
for doing key exchange, an elliptic curve algorithm takes about the same 
time and has about the same level of security as DH with 512 bit modulus, 
and that elliptic curve has a speed advantage if greater security is 
desired.
