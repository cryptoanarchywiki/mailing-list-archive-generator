Alex -

  There may be *an ulterior motive* of getting the person's ssn, i.e., for
the purpose of the newspaper (and the winner) reporting winnings to IRS.  In
addition, the newspaper may also feel that, in selecting a 10-digit number,
it probably will not repeat such as someone's birthdate.  Personally, I lean
towards the former.

  I agree with you.  I believe *greed* is the operating word....
