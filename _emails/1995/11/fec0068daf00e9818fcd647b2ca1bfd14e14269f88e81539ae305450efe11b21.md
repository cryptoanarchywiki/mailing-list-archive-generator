	Is it?  This is the _one_ thing in the article (is that term
giving it too much legitimacy?) that I whought was barely true.  Whoever
controls the root level DNS servers effectively controls the Internet.
I postulated a couple of months ago about how the US Govt might attempt
to censor the rest of the world: "Remove lurid.porno.site.other-country
from your DNS system within 72 hours or we will remove references to
your DNS servers from the root level servers.".  (I also speculated that
if the US Govt tried doing this, that an 'underground' DNS system would
form almost immediately.)

	At least, it was allegedly lost.  If I were wanting to hype it,
I'd just _claim_ that it was lost.
