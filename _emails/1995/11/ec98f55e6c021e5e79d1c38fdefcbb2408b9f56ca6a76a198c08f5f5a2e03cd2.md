Gee, I hope they didn't spook you too badly when they jumped out at you

Easy: both. 1,154 wiretaps, and 20K to 25K intercepts, which includes both 
wiretaps and other interceptions, i.e., recording which phone numbers you

By whom is the FBI being sued? What is the case number? Who are the 
lawyers? What are their Bar numbers? How many times have they been 
disciplined for bringing frivolous suits?
