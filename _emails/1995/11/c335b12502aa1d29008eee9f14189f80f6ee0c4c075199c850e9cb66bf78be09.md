You don't really need a special (and clearly suspicious) IP address to
perform driftnet fishing.  All you need is to be sure that all physical
packets pass through a checkpoint charlie and just park a sniffer there
to watch everything fly by.

On the other hand, it would be interesting to see how hard NSA pushes
behind the scenes to have physical long distance cables run through the
US routers/switches (in the name of US national security, of course).

It would be fun (perhaps horrible) to see what the NSA does the first
time Isreal or France set up their own high capacity long distance to
other friendly/unfriendly countries (thus bypassing the US completely).
Second, let France or some other country set up major Internet routing
clearinghouses which advertise secure routes to other nations (not US).
