    <attila sez>  I think they have that one covered --not only is it 
violation of ITAR's intent to send a programmer out of the U.S., but is 
illegal to hire a foreign national to program for your non-U.S. products.
    the test is going to be with someone like Sun who "bought" a group of 
Russian crypto programmers and left them in Russia.  Now, the problem 
with ITAR is that if you import that code, you can not then export the 
code since it is now covered by ITAR.
    secondly, it appears there is a move afoot to make it an ITAR 
violation to hire the foreign nationals to circumvent ITAR --basically, 
the Feds want to stop cryptography _everywhere_, including telling 
Russians they can not work for U.S. companies!  Just where do they think 
they are getting off?

    then, when ALL hitech moves out of the U.S. and the DoD needs us, we 
will not be here, will we?
