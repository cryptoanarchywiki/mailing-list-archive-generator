	Would not generating random numbers using video sources be
suseptable to the same 'external' influences as generating random numbers
from radio static? External RF fields could skew the 'randomness' of the
data. 
	As another thought, has anyone done any work on RNGs involving
chaotic processes such as fluid dynamics and turbulent flow? I suspect
that pressure, or other parameter variences, in turbulent flow could yield
good random numbers. As a bonus, these parameters are easily measurable 
without special, exotic, equipment and should be inexpensive
