This reminds me of an incident that occurred in California last year. A
number of people received a notice that they had just won an
all-expenses-paid trip. Most of them turned up to get their gift only to
then discover that it was a Government Sting Operation and that the trip
was to Jail (they were all wanted on outstanding warrants which were
waiting for them when they arrived at the meeting site).
