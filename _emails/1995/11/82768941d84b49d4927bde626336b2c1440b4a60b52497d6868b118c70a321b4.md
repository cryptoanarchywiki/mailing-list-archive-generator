Yes.  D'oh.  I realized this while talking to Dave shortly after I posted.
All the bank does is send back the cube root of what it received from the
client.  If the client wants to multiply by the cube of a random number
before sending to the bank, and dividing by that random number after,
that's up to it.  The system Hal mentioned, though (client sends payment
requests, receives payments, deposits them), still doesn't infringe,
as long as it doesn't do _withdrawls_.
