Pardon me, but what was the point of that last comment?  It is an obvious
statement of fact that yes, IF IF IF somebody had a secret key AND password,
he could duplicate a signature.  

Digital signatures allow a person to exclude others from being able to sign
messages as if they are from him.  True, a person could simply publish his
secret key and password, at which point everyone could sign notes as if they
came from him, but that wouldn't be "interesting" because most people would
have no reason to do so.

>Signing with PGP is just not a solution.

It is, apparently, in the vast majority of possible situations.  Why would
you even try to disagree?

Oh, yes, I forgot... you're Detweiler.
