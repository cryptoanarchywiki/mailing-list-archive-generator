But the problem is more on the application side than on the library
side.  If necessary, you can simply design the plug-in crypto function
to regard the first n bytes of the input buffer as a key.  On the
other hand, how do you explain why your application (for which you're
seeking export approval) is generating keys in the first place?  And
what's this other piece of code over here that just sits around and
captures mouse movements at random intervals? :)
