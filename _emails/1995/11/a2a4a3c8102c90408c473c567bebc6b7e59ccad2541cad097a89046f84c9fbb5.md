I'd be nervous about using a radio receiver which can be fed with a signal
by the adversary.  A noisy resistor or diode should be less subject to bias
by an active opponent.

Whatever you use for a source of bits, it should be carefully measured to
determine how much real entropy is in the source.  Don't assume all the
bits you get are independent, flat distribution bits.

You might need to hash bits down until you get independence.  You also
might want to provide some further ranno conditioning.

	and http://www.clark.net/pub/cme/html/ranno.html   (on conditioning)
