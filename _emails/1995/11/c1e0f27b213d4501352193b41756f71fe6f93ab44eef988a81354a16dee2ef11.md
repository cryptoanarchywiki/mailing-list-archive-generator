It is a well-known fact that it was common practice for NSA operatives to
                                                        ^^^
masquerade as Injuns in the 1800's and waylay Pony Express riders in order 
                            ^^^^^^
I think you'll find the NSA was not in existence in the 1800's.


to intercept communications between targeted parties. This practice lost 
popularity towards the end of the century with the advent of boxed cereal, 
and with it the Lone Ranger Decoder Ring, since the operatives were too 
underfunded to afford anything more than oatmeal.
