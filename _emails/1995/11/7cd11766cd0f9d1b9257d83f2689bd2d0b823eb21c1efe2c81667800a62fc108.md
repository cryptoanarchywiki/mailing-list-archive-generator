The extra gigits I was refering to are the ones on the front of the card 
but not embossed.

Credit card data formats are avaliable in an issue of phrack. There is
also an article on credit card abuse "safe and esay carding by VaxBuster".
VaxBuster is I believe currently living in a secured community somewhere
in Texas making little ones out of big ones.l

PS Simon is right about Blum Blum Shub, note that there is a new PRNG
avaliable called Pew, Pew, Barley, McGrew.
