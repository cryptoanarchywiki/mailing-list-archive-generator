                         First Call For Papers

                              CARDIS 1996

    SECOND SMART CARD RESEARCH AND ADVANCED APPLICATION CONFERENCE

            September 18-20, 1996, Amsterdam, The Netherlands

AIMS AND GOALS

Smart cards or IC cards offer a huge potential for information
processing purposes. The portability and processing power of IC cards
allow for highly secure conditional access and reliable distributed
information systems. IC cards are already available that can perform
highly sophisticated cryptographic computations. The applicability of
IC cards is currently limited mainly by our imagination; the
information processing power that can be gained by using IC cards
remains as yet mostly untapped and is not well understood. Here lies a
vast uncovered research area which we are only beginning to assess, and
which will have great impact on the eventual success of the technology.
The research challenges range from electrical engineering on the
hardware side to tailor-made cryptographic applications on the software
side, and their synergies.

Many currently existing events are mainly devoted to commercial and
application aspects of IC cards. In contrast, the CARDIS conferences
aim to bring together researchers who are active in all aspects of
design of IC cards and related devices and environment, such as to
stimulate synergy between different research communities and to offer a
platform for presenting the latest research advances. CARDIS 1994,
sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing
(IFIP) and held in November 1994 in Lille, France, has successfully
brought together representatives from leading IC research centers from
all over the world. CARDIS 1996 will be the second occasion for the IC
card community in this permanent activity. CARDIS 1996 will be
organised jointly by the Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science at
Amsterdam (CWI) and the Department of Computer Systems of the
University of Amsterdam (UvA).


SUBMISSIONS

LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

Advice to Authors for the Preparation of Camera-Ready Contributions to
LNCS/LNAI Proceedings

The preparation of manuscripts which are to be reproduced by
photo-offset requires special care. Manuscripts which are submitted in
technically unsuitable form will be returned for retyping or cancelled
if the volume otherwise cannot be finished on time. In order to make
the volume look as uniform as possible the following instructions
should be followed closely.

************

* PRINTING AREA:
Using 10-point font size for the main text the printing area should be
12.2 x 19.3 cm. Manuscripts prepared in this preferred format are
reproduced in the same size in the book. With these settings, the
interline distance should be arranged in such a way that some 42 to 45
lines occur on a full-text page.

* TYPEFACE and SIZE:
We recommend the use of Times or one of the similar typefaces widely
used in phototypesetting. (In Times and similar typefaces the letters
have serifs, i.e., short endstrokes at the head and the foot of
letters.) Please do not use a sans-serif typeface for running text,
except for computer programs.

The text should always be justified to occupy the full line width, so
that the right margin is not ragged. For normal text please use
10-point type size and one-line spacing. Small print (abstract and
affiliation) should be set in 9-point type size. Please use italic
print to emphasize words in running text; bold type in running text
and underlining should be avoided.

Headings should be capitalized (i.e., nouns, verbs and all other words
with at least five letters should have a capital initial) and should,
with the exception of the title, be aligned to the left. The font
sizes are as follows:

************

Heading level      Example Font          size and style

Title (centered)     Type Theory           14 point, bold
1st-level heading    1 Introduction        12 point, bold
2nd-level heading  2.1 Simple Connections  10 point, bold
3rd-level heading    Typing Rules.         10 point, bold
4th-level heading  Remarks: (text follows) 10 point,italic

************

* FIGURES:
If possible, originals should be pasted into the manuscript and
centered between the margins; if no originals of the required size are
available, figures may be reduced in scale and pasted into the text.
For halftone figures (photos), please forward high-contrast glossy
prints and mark the space in the text as well as the back of the
photographs clearly, so that there can be no doubt about where or
which way up they should be placed. The lettering of figures should be
in 10-point font size. Figures should be numbered. The legends also
should be centered between the margins and be written in 9-point font
size as follows:

(bold) Fig. 3. (text follows)

* PAGE NUMBERING:
Your paper should show no printed page numbers; they are decided by
the volume editor and finally inserted by the printer. Please indicate
the ordering of your pages by numbering the sheets (using a light
blue/green pencil) at the bottom of the reverse side. There also
should be no running heads.

* PRINTING QUALITY:
For reproduction we need sheets which are printed on one side only.
Please use a high-resolution printer, preferably a laser printer with
at least 300 dpi or higher resolution if possible. It is desirable
that on all pages the text appears in the middle of the sheets.

* REMARK 1:
If your typesetting system does not offer the variety of font sizes
needed for the preparation of your manuscript according to these
instructions, you may choose a different (larger) font size and a
correspondingly scaled printing area (12-point font size for the
running text, for example, corresponds to a printing area of 15.3 x
24.2 cm and to a final reduction rate of 80%).

* REMARK 2:
You are encouraged to use LaTeX or TeX for the preparation of you
camera-ready manuscript together with the corresponding Springer style
files "llncs" (for LaTeX) or "plncs" (for TeX) to be obtained by
e-mail or by ftp/gopher as follows:

Mailserver: Send an e-mail message to
   svserv@vax.ntp.springer.de  containing the line
   get /tex/latex/llncs.zip  for the LaTeX syle files or
   get /tex/plain/plncs.zip  for the TeX style files.
Sending "help" to the server prompts advice on how to interact with
the mail server. The style files have to be unzipped and uu-decoded
for use. In case of problems in getting or uu-decoding the style files
please contact "springer vax.ntp.springer.de".

Ftp: The internet address is "trick.ntp.springer.de", the user id
"ftp" or "anonymous". Please enter your e-mail address as password.
The (above mentioned) files reside in "/pub/tex/latex/llncs".

Gopher: Point your client to "trick.ntp.springer.de".
