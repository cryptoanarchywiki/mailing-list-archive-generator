    	<#2 attila sez> the problem with the U.S. government is the U.S. 
    conspiracy laws. If they have insufficient evidence to convict on 
    "actual" violations, they use the concept that you were _part_ of a
    conspiracy to _circumvent_ the laws.

	<#2 attila> I guess I should have stated it better: what they are 
    trying to do, for instance with Sun, is treat that foreign entity as
    if it was a direct operating unit of the parent U.S. company.  OK,
    fine, you hire your Russian crypto programming team and my take from
    several conversation is that it is a _good_ team, but the U.S. wants
    to enforce the rule that the code produced in Russia for a "parent"
    American company is _a U.S. product_!  --in other words, the foreign
    division can not sell it overseas.  So far, noone has been charged, 
    but my sources say Sun is the most likely. 
	Either way you slice it, Sun is committed to world wide 
    compatability, and with that goes security, including worldwide NFS.
    You figure it out... 
	what is the alternative for Sun, or Netscape? yup, close down in 
    the U.S. and go to Holland --oh, they can keep their sales offices in
    the U.S.  --but they will be paying import duty, or they will end up
    contracting local assembly.  closing down in the U.S. literally means
    off NASDAQ.
	the fact that our government is effectively totalitarian is their 
    paranoia -only paranoia that they might miss something or that they
    are not in total control stimulates the kind of attack on the 
    Constitution that is going on.

     	<#2 attila> yes, that is true, but that is not the point --we have
    been doing that ever since I have been involved in crypto. 20 years
    ago when the heat was on me, somebody else dumped it whereever. even
    simple things get the Feds' dander up and they need an example; if I
    had not had a U.S. Senator (and I never even met the gentleman) in my
    corner, I would have gone down for the big one in '76. 
	Look at the problem Phil Zimmerman is having --several hundred
    thousand dollars in legal fees so far --for what; the original
    algorithms were published in Scientific American in Oct 77 --and then
    there was _silence_.  Just try and find a copy of that issue in a
    public library; most were pulled. 
	I may have been really pissed off after a couple thugs in trench
    coats knocked on _my_ door early morning to read me my rights for
    "exporting technology to a foreign power," or being detained in a
    little white room for 36 hours at immigration after speaking at a
    conference in Sweden and another in Copenhagen that was highly
    critical of U.S. policy --and discussing advanced hardware techniques
    for emulating BCD machines in not BCD bit slices --just happened to
    match the old Burroughs 3500s which were in all the missle silos
    --now, whatever gave them that idea? :)
	Ask Phil Zimmerman if he would do it again-- I will, because I
    don't give a shit, am old enough that I can afford to have ethics, and
    I am a Jeffersonian democrat; jefferson must be spinning over the 
    speed of light over what the _conservatives_ would do, let alone what
    the liberal Democrats will bleed and do, like Clinton, or Hillary and
    her lez buddy Thomases, who, unpaid, occupies an office in the front
    row (she was the one who was seen carrying Foster's files upstairs to
    Hillary).

	<#2 attila>  naw. they're too stupid and too paranoid to give up. 
    the U.S. has not had a free election since Lincoln's first term and
    Stanton wrote the War Powers Act which, to this day, has not been
    repealed. Russia has more democracy than the U.S. --even if they are
    totally SNAFU.  The U.S. hasn't degenerated to Hussein or the
    Ayatollah, but if NSA and Freeh have their way, it might. As Will
    Rogers said in the early 30s: "...go to the circus? why would I want 
    to do that when Congress is in session?"  or Mark Twain, who said
    something to the effect:  "...the only natural criminal class in
    America is our Congress...."
	it's all a matter of control, or the appearance of being in 
    control. No, they cant bust all of us, but they can set some pretty 
   painful and expensive example of a few of us.  ...been there, and done
   that!
