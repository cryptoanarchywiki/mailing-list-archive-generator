The cypherpunks mailing list has a lot to do with cryptography,
an important element of cryptography is randomness one way that
seems to be a superior source for obtaining random data is 
radioactive decay, radiation detectors wich have an RS232 interface 
can be hooked up to an computer and thus act as a source of randomness.
