I wish this were the case. Mixmaster is not based on the "Dining
Cryptographers" problem, but based on Chaum's "Digital Mixes".

Digital mixes hide the fact that A is communicating with B.
DC nets allow an individual A in a group of people A' to send a message
so that it is impossible to tell who in the group sent it (but it is known
to have been one of the members of A').
