THE WWW MUST BE CONSUMER FRIENDLY IF IT IS TO SURVIVE.

THE AVERAGE CONSUMER THRU A PC, OR A "DEDICATED WEB TERMINAL ON TOP OF THEIR
TV SET", MUST BE ABLE TO USE THE WEB IN THE FUTURE TO:

          1. SEARCH FOR CONSUMER GOODS; ORDER CONSUMER GOODS.
          2. USE THE WEB FOR TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS AND E-MAIL
          3. DOWNLOAD TIME SHIFT AUDIO & VIDEO
          4. DOWLOAD MOVIES, SOFTWARE, AND P.P.V. EVENTS
          5. HOOK ON-LINE TO VIDEO & AUDIO 

THE WWW AND THE ON-LINE SERVICES MUST BE ABLE TO DIAL OUT TO THE CONSUMER
ALSO.

OUR BIGGEST FUTURE PROBLEM IS THAT WE CAN NOT LET BILL GATES, NOR THE
TELEPHONE COMPANIES, NOR THE CABLE TV COMPANIES, NOR THE MADISON AVENUE
ADVERTISING AGENCIES GET CONTROL OF THE WWW.

OUR CURRENT PROBLEM IS THAT THE AVERAGE CONSUMER CAN NOT COMPLETE AN ACCURATE
SEARCH ON THE WEB.

COMPANIES MUST BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS, AND TO
EMBED EVERY POSSIBLE KEYWORD IN THEIR SITE SO THAT IN THE FUTURE A CONSUMER
COULD ENTER AT THE SEARCH LINE:
        "SHOW ALL DEALERS IN BALTIMORE THAT SELL CHRYSLER MINI-VANS"
AND AN ACCURATE SEACH OF THE WEB WILL BE RETURNED.

AT THIS POINT SO MANY CYBERPUNKS HAVE EMBEDDED SO MUCH GARBAGE ON THE WEB,
THAT YOU CAN NOT COMPLETE AN ACCURATE SEARCH.

OUR COMPANY HAS BEEN ASKED BY THE NEW YORK AUTO SHOW TO CREATE THE MOST
HIGHTECH VIRTUAL REALITY MOTION SIMULATOR THEATRE FOR THE 1996 NEW YORK AUTO
SHOW. DURING OUR RESEARCH, WE ENTERED "NEW YORK AUTO SHOW" IN OUR WEB CRAWLER
(AMERICA ON-LINE). YOU COULD NOT BELIEVE ALL OF THE GARBAGE THAT WAS RETURNED
FROM OUR SEARCH.

ADDITIONALLY FOR EXAMPLE, IF ON AMERICA ON-LINE YOU NEED TO SEND AN E-MAIL TO
DONALD TRUMP OR TO AOL'S STEVE CASE, WHEN YOU SEARCH THE AOL MEMBER DATABASE,
WHO IS THE REAL DONALD TRUMP OR THE REAL STEVE CASE.

IN SUMMARY, WHAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED AT  IETF IN DALLAS NEXT WEEK IS A
STANDARD THAT PROTECTS TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS, AND ALSO A POLICING
AGENCY THAT WILL DETERMINE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS AT DONALD TRUMP@, CHRYSLER IS
AT CHRYSLERY@ BILL GATES IS AT BILL GATES@, ETC.

BUT MORE IMPORTANT, WE NEED TO CLEANUP THE TRASH THAT THE CYBER-PUNKS ARE
PLACING ON THE WEB.
