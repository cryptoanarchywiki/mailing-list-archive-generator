It sounds like you understand even less about the details of digital cash
than I do.

First, read the August 1992 issue of Scientific American, the article by
David Chaum.  He explains, with a certain amount of detail, how blinded
digital cash operates.  To become validated and worth money, it first has to
be electronically "written," blinded, and then signed by the bank.  Then it
is unblinded, at which point it can be spent.  

What I was saying is that the notes would be written by the payee, then
blinded by the payee, given to the payer, and then signed by the payer's
bank.  At this point, they are worth money, and they are then returned to
the payee, possibly by encrypting them and publishing them in encrypted form
on a publicly-accessible portion of the Internet, so "anyone" could read
them.  Only the intended payee would be able to decrypt them, however, and
only the payee would be able to unblind the notes.
