This was not the question. He wants to prevent local Windows passwords
from being created for network-only users. This is a serious security
issue, because if a user enters her real network password for the Windows
password, and someone else later picks up the .PWL files, which are not
encrypted in a particularly secure way, then someone can get unauthorized
access to the network as the previous user(s).

We believe we have found answers in the Registry and in POLEDIT. We've
also turned up another related security bug. When it's confirmed, we'll
post. In the mean time, you can read the last couple messages archived at
gopher://quixote.stanford.edu/1m/win95netbugs.
