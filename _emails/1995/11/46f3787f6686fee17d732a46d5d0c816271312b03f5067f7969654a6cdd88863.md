   True, it's not Smokey behind the billboard, blinked at you
   by oncoming headlights, it's the sensors in the roadbed
   that reads your tag -- when it leaves your home-ain, then
   at the remailer donkeystops, then at your recreational
   stash-house, at the pedo-filmery, at the Semtex-Pantex
   workhide, at the digi-wallet-copyfast, right into
   ananonymous Ken-Barbie's e-slot.

   TLA-Smokey is friendly, maybe intra-humanly let you off
   with a warning, not the anonymous high-techery, it responds
   only to its friend, the tag -- tracing, storing, mutating 
the
   whinefleshers, 0's by 1's.

   That's the how, maybe, but for who or what or why?

   Or is it just machines feeding machines incomprehensibles?
