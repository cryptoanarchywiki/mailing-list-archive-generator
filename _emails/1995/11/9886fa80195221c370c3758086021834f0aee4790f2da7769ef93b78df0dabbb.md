   A gruel of high-tech privacy ghoulisms:

   Nov 4 Economist on burgeoning health services by "outsiders"
   like defense firms in which lucrative data banks on 
patients'
   rotting carcasses are abuilding for resale.

   Nov 9 W$J on a conference tut-tutting data banking of
   citizens' repulsive life styles.

   Nov 9 Financial Times on British Gov smarmily smart
   "transaction cards" banking citizens' pathetic fears.
