How about command-line compression options. Gzip, for example, allows you
to specify how good you want the compression to be, with better
compression taking longer. So you could justify passing a set of options
to the compression algorithm, which could also be used to pass key 
information to the encryption algorithm. In fact, you could pass in a 
void * pointer to options that had been set up in a preferences panel in 
the application, which would be provided by the plug-in compression or 
encryption code. That structure could then have anything you wanted in it.

Also, I'm not sure you'd need to pass a key, surely the encryption code 
could do all the key-handling itself ?
