Friend, 
 
 
An 11 21 95 Reuter Information Service newsstory, headed 
 
      Computer illiterates offered new way onto Internet 
 
[OR: Junk mail wants to meet computer illiterate for safe sale] 
 
reports: 
 
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co said on Tuesday it had 
   developed a way of accessing the Internet using the fam- 
   iliar telephone and fax machine.... 
 
   With the Matsushita system, users can obtain an index 
   via a facsimile machine and choose Internet subjects 
   they are interested in by keying in numbers on their tele- 
   phones.... 
 
   The telephone and fax are connected to server comput- 
   ers.... 
 
   Information coming back arrives as ordinary sound over 
   the telephone handset or as printed text off the facsimile. 
 
 
AT&T was offering an index of newsstories in a series of 
ads in the Wall Street Journal a couple of years ago.  You 
faxed the code numbers of the stories you wanted to read 
to AT&T; and AT&T faxed back the stories. 
 
                   FIRST RULE OF JUNK MAIL 
 
If you can sell it to the elite, you can sell it to the masses. 
 
 
Cordially, 
 
Jim
