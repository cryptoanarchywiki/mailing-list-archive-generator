S'punks,

Anyone need a job in the Bay Area?  I think a Cypherpunk would be
ideal for this job.

Dear Friends,

We need help.  

We need a combination web-cultivator, researcher, editor, conference assistant 
and Notes/Mac wizard.  In sum, a typical enterpreneurial utility infielder.  

Finding people who comfortably straddle the worlds of public policy and high 
technology can be tricky.  We look to you, as someone familiar with The 
Bionomics Institute, for assistance in this key search.  (After all, this one 
hire represents a 33% increase in our staff.) 

If you know of such a person, please get the following information to them, or 
get them in touch with us.

Thanks,
Steve
