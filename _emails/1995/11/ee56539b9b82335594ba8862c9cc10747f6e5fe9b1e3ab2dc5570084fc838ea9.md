Because I don't have a real UUCP connection at the moment.  Khijol is 
expected to get back on the net as khijol.org in the next few days.  Just 
trying to get by until then :)

Yes, but that only establishes that I was the one who wrote the post, not 
that I am to be trusted...

I've met a fair number of people in person that I've met over the net, and
I'm here to tell you that a lot of people I've met are totally different
in person than they are over the net.  People that I thought I could trust
gave me the willies in person, and I eventually found out that I couldn't
trust them at all.  Get burned a couple of times like that, and you learn
to suspend trust until you really meet someone in person. 

Just my $0.02.
