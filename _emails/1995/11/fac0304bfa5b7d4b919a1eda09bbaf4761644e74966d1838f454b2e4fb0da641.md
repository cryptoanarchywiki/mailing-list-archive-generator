Most people believe THAT a digital signature is evidence that I am who my
signature _says_ I am when it really doesn't do that at all.  It isn't
reliable at all. 

Unfortunately, I've learned the hard way NOT to do that.  Digital 
signatures don't prevent spoofing.

In fact, I think that thinking something is secure when it isn't leads 
to even more trouble, and could even lead to many tragedies.

In a nutshell, here's the problem.

If someone takes my pgp secret keyring and my password, then they can 
sign a message *digitally* so that people believe the spoofed message is 
really from me.  In fact, since most people tend to rely on a pgp message 
far more than a non-pgp message, most people would be absolutely 
convinced that the message was in fact from me.

Signing with PGP is just not a solution.
