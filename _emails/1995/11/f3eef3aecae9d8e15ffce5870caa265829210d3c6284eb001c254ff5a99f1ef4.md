This paragraph sounds a _lot_ like what I wrote in sci.crypt a while back
on the usefullness of AI and neural nets for crypto. Sounds almost like
exactly the paragraph I wrote, in fact.

And I recollect that Bruce dropped me a note saying I made the point
succinctly and that he wanted to use what I said in his next edition. (My
recollection at least, but I don't have any easy way anymore of searching
my several hundred megs of accumulated mail, articles, etc.)

I have no problem with Bruce using my points. I hope he didn't use my
_exact_ words, though. But not a cosmic issue.
