A non-problem.

Ask any business whether the "minimum denominated coin" is a penny. Perhaps
the minimum denoominated _coin_ is a penny, in the U.S., but vast numbers
of widgets are priced at sub-cent levels.

True, no purchase orders are written for sub-cent prices, but this is a
transaction cost issue, not something basic to the currency. (Likewise,
Hal's concerns about ecash speed are basically transaction cost issues.)
