Yes, this is a good example of one of the scams.

If the lottery can't/won't reveal True Names of winners--a basic design
criterion--then clearly people may have doubts.

The whole thing can be cast as follows;

"Send us money and we'll put your name in a hat. We'll let you know if you
win, but we won't tell the public who won." (This problem is quite similar
to voting protocols, so we might look to "fair voting" protocols for
ideas.)

My intuition (hand-waving) is that an anonymous lottery is possible, but I
haven't looked at the details. Certainly multiple trusted holders of keys
(escrow agents) would help make the lottery fair. Maybe bit commitment
would help (each player buys the right to play, then "commits" his number.
A public reading of the winning number occurs, and the winner can reveal
his winning number (anonymously if he wishes, providing he had registered
his hash....).
