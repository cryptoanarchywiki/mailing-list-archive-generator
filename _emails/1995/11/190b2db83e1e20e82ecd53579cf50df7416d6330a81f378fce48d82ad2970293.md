Actually, nothing in the ITAR says foreigners can't USE the
U.S. version of PGP, just that you can't give them the software.

However, I think it is a bad idea to make PGP available on a multiuser
computer. It encourages a very, very bad habit -- that of using PGP on
a multiuser computer....

But since you are using this software on a multiuser computer over
likely insecure lines, or, even worse, over an insecure LAN, all you
are going to do is make things even stickier when someone steals a key
and starts pretending to be some faculty member anyway.

Don't use public key software on untrusted hardware over insecure
links. Its a BAD BAD BAD thing.
