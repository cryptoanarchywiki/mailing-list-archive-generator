Yes, I've noticed these as well.  One troubling thing I noted with one
such spam-handed "attack" was the use of a group of internal email
addresses (in the sense that we don't advertise these addresses) as
addressees for a message that had an analog sent to www-buyinfo and
some other web related addresses.  This seems to indicate a way of
organizing lists into sets based on location/topic, but doesn't
include all other potential addressees in the same domain or
organization.

I guess it was only a matter of time before someone wrote
sophisticated spamming servers that somehow capture/analyze log files,
or is this just some idiot front end that lets ad-happy fools spam
with a smaller apparent footprint?

By the way... One reply I got from an ISP re: one of these drive by
spammings indicated that they were charging the idiot for disobeying
policy.  I've started suggesting to ISPs that they dis-user and charge
the offender (in case they haven't thought of this yet).  If non-spam
policies were more widely used, and these idiots loose their
email/access and a few hundred dollars in charges for wasting ISP
admin time, perhaps this trend won't continue.
