I didn't contend that its inferior. I contended that its difficult to
distinguish from sources of electronic interference and is easy to get
wrong.

However, its very easy to be sure that the event in a radiation
detector was a radioactive decay event. It takes expertise to make
sure that the noise you hear off a noisy circuit isn't just
interference from other parts of the machine feeding back into the
circuit. The reason I like radioactive sources is that they are simple
and unambiguous in this way.

Someone can gimmick a zener diode or get it "wrong" a lot more easily
than they can get a radation event wrong.
