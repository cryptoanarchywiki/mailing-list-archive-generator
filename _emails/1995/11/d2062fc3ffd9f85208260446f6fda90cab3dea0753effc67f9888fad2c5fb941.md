A DejaNews search for "BestCrypt" turned up an announcement by
Sergey Frolov in comp.security.misc
on November 14th. According to him, it implements GOST, single DES, and IDEA.
They have DOS and Windows versions. He says [big sic for this quote]:

	All algorithm available simultaneosly - you may change
	algorithm for your data easy - it's look like to change the password...

	I have non-commercial demo version of the product (370 Kb arjed 
	distributive) and I can send it to people who will be interested in it.
