A funny thought just occurred to me. Micheal Froomkin was recently saying
that the wonderful ITAR applies to American citizens regardless of country
of location. Wouldn't this inane technicality apply to David Chaum in 
Holland? He is American, right? Ever get any problems at US customs David?
The Digicash trial software certainly had crypto in it. I don't remember 
any export controls.
