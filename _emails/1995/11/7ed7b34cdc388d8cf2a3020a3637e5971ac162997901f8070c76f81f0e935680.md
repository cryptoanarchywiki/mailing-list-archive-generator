Don't be shy: POST! If you've got good coding ideas, then by all
means we want to hear you. If you've got lousy ideas but good intentions,
the fastest way on the net to get corrected is to post a mistake :-) .
Nobody will flame you for that, so don't be so touchy.

Some of us codewriters are far lazier than others on the list, 
politicical discussion seems to take less effort and is the lowest common
denominator (too bad, but then I'm guilty; snore...).

Hardly. Don't worry about it, besides, killfiles exist. I agree  
wholeheartedly too, I'd love to see more crypto code and protocol discussion.
I must point out though, that the quality you get is related to the 
quality you give, if you post crypto code/protocol material (I'm too lazy 
for that, right now...), that's what the debate will shift to.
Kind of like "Build it and they will come." (Field of Dreams?).

Curious, where is uncg.edu? Your French name doesn't make me think you're 
in the States (as an .edu address might suggest, but then not necessarily 
either). (univ of Calgary?)

Bonne fin de semaine.
