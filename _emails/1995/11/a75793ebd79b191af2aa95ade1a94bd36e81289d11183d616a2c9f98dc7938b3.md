	Maximchuck's anon credit card system depends to a huge degree
on fast, highly available remailers, but he makes no provisions for
funding them.  He suggested at a talk I attended that the Federal
Reserve could operate the one remailer that his system would use to
protect your privacy.

	Other than that, its an interesting system which uses no
public key crypto for mostly anonymous transactions.
