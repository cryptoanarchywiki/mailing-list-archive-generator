Actually ;-) Barksdale going to jail would probably advance the cause of
strong cryptography more than anything I can think of.  Can you imagine
the media circus when he's led out the door in handcuffs?  A man worth
somewhere around a billion dollars being arrested for trying to give away
his product?  Court reporters trying to explain ITAR to the public?  The
mind boggles.

... and he looked over at me and said, "What are ya in for?" and I said,
"Giving away free software," and they all moved away from me on the bench ...

You guys didn't get to where you are now waiting around for HTML v3.0 to
be approved.  There must be some way to challenge an attempt to use ITAR
to stop the DOMESTIC spread of strong crypto that doesn't involve the
incarceration of your top executives ...
