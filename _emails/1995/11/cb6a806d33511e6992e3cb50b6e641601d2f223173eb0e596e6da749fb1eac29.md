You miss the central point. The NSA are simply one link in a beuracratic
chain. Their behaviour is determined by their position in that chain and
the nature of the question they are asked. If we could change the 
question they were asked from "is this dangerous" to "is this significantly
more dangerous than allowing ownership of guns" we might get somewhere.
