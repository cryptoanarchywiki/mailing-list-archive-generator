   Ito has shared an LA Times report of October 21 on frantic
   Japanese economic espionage, there and in the US, and its
   booming bugging and wiretapping industry.

   And The Wash Post simpers today about the CIA-Mils self-
   sucking into the eco-spy quagmire to garner funds, as spit
   in its toon yesterday.

   More non-crypto: FinTimes jabbers today in "Cars safe from
   phone threat," on the weird effects on automobile
   "electronic-based safety-critical systems" of pervasive
   sources of electro-magnetic interference, say by your
   mobile phone or police transceivers, that may catapult
   the family-fun Land Rover into Rancid's roadbus.
