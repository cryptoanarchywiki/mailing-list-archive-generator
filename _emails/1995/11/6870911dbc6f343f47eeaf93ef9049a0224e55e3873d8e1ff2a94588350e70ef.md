Neither was SSL, for that matter.  But it seems like every vendor
who's written an S-HTTP browser/server is adding SSL for version 1.1.

None, of course, just as rsh doesn't help me connect to a telnet 
server. My comment wasn't on the wisdom of SKIP, but rather on 
the specific statement Perry made about single vendors being able 
to drive certain protocols on their own (e.g., SSL and others).

More interesting from the historical view (but lacking in crypto 
significance so I'll refrain from further posting on the topic) 
is the question of what other protocols have been put forth by 
single vendors and gained major market share.
