I also was sent a copy of Ron Rivest's latest paper on timed-release crypto
(also available at the URL http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/).

These noted cryptographers, Amir, Ron, and others, are of course doing
"real cryptography" on this timed-released stuff....my speculations in '93
and later are informal, rough considerations. There are dangers in using
"common sense" in protocols like this, but, then, few of us have the time
to explore things in enough detail.

I just wanted to clarify things, though I suspect most of you know that
many of my arguments (and those of others, too) are based on informal, bull
session, sorts of foundations. This is often enough at a very early stage.
No substitute for much more rigorous, published-paper-quality analyses, of
course.

In the past, I have actually gotten warning letters from some of my
Internet Service Providers saying that my views were inimical to their own
views. One provider, who shall remain nameless, actually *turned off* my
access to NetNews until I agreed to post a clarification that the views I
was expressing were not his views!

Views here are not the views of my Internet Service Provider or Government.
