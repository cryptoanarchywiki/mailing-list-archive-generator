No legal opinions here, but perhaps you give it to someone who you know is
legally entitled to have it and give them permission to redistribute it.  For
example, MIT, RSA, and c2.org already distribute export-controlled software
via FTP, so if they're willing, you could give copies to people there and
publish MD5 checksums.

It's appreciated as is your participation here.
