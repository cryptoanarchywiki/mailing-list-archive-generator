|    To secure Net communications, the government will need to have access to
|  private data exchanges using what is known as a key escrow security system,
|  said Clark. He added that an invincible security system for the Net is 
|  possible, but such a system won't be built unless the government
| has a stake in it. "That's where key escrow comes in," said Clark. 

	(Assuming this means Netscape intends to build-in key escrow,
not lobby for it...)

	How does Netscape intend to address the liability issues if
the key database is stolen and their *voluntary* actions lead to my
private communications being exposed?

(Jeff, if you could pass this on to the powers that escrow, I'd
appriciate it.  I know you're here on behalf of you, but...)
