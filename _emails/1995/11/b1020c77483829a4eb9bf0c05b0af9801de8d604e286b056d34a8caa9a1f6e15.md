I was using a Commodore 64 and a 300 bps modem for networking to the old
online services of the day.  That whole setup cost less than 300 dollars
at the time, and had a disk drive too.  I guess it would be feasable to
make a really cheap machine, fit it with a more modern modem and connect
it to the internet.

I feel sad when they say that the market for <1000 $ machines is nill, I 
had so much fun and learned so much from my old machines.
