I can't help that. We were very loud about our efforts and I
publicized them wherever I could. I mentioned drafts here on
cypherpunks and elsewhere frequently. We tried to solicit the help of
lots of people in the crypto community. I was begging people for help
with our MD5 and other transforms for months and months. I believe
that lots of people were aware of what was going on and just didn't
take us seriously until the last minute.

I pretty much know whats going on throughout the IETF, although I
don't know all the petty details. I think that its a matter of trying
to remain plugged in and following the announcements of drafts.

There are lots of IETF web pages already.

I truly dislike that idea. I hope that this never comes to pass. Text is
just fine. RFCs are perfectly readable right now. The problem is more
getting people to read them than legibility problems. If anything
would be an improvement it would be postscript, and I oppose that even
though its easy for anyone who wants to to get a postscript interpreter.

I would like to see such a thing as well. I would also like to see a
system which permitted perfectly just adjudicaiton of disputes without
need for evidence. Unfortunately, neither is possible.
