Friend, 
 
 
People are complaining about junk mail.  No problem... 
 
11 21 95 The Electronic Telegraph reports: 
 
   THE European Parliament will decide today whether to 
   ban junk mail. 
 
   Euro MPs are also considering whether to outlaw credit 
   card transactions by phone and whether direct selling 
   via E-mail should be curbed. 
 
   Today's vote has been triggered by proposals from the 
   European Commission to protect consumers buying 
   goods without seeing them. 
 
 
Your complaints are highly valued at Minute Mortuary at 
2d & Main, which advertises "Privacy Knows No Limits." 
 
 
Cordially, 
 
Jim
