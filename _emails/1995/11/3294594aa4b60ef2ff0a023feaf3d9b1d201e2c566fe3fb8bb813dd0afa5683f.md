It's come to my attention that the US government has a group
called the 'Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes 
Enforcement Network' in Vienna, Virginia.

I know that burocrats like to keep themselves busy, but even 
I didn't think they would go so far as to enforce crimes to 
keep the law enforcement people busy.

What a curious way to spend the taxpayers money.

P.S. :-) for the humor impaired.
