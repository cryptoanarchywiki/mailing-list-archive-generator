Sure.  Consider it done.

Weak attempt at crypto relevance:

Couldn't trusted date/time-stamping signing robots be used
to establish that offline ecash particles had reached
certain points in their journey?  Might not a bank say
that in the event of a dispute, it will accept the ecash
copy signed earliest by Framis Signer or specified
alternate with claimant's ID inside the disposable
signature wrapper?  I suppose one might just as well 
authenticate the ecash with the bank itself, except that 
the signed copy allows withholding identity unless and 
until there is a dispute.
