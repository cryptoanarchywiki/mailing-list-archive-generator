My test copy of the Ecash software logs what coins were spent - wouldn't
something like that constitute evidence that any claim was made? Failing
that, wouldn't Ed be able to tell the bank 'these coins were
misplaced/lost/damaged. please cancel them', and then re-issue any payment due?

*If* Alice really paid Ed, then he would have evidence of such, whether
Charlie's claim is valid or not. With the cash in hand, Ed should reasonably
be able to re-issue them, just as one could put a stop-payment on a check
and re-issue.

Or am I completely missing something here? (always a possibility, I suppose :-)
