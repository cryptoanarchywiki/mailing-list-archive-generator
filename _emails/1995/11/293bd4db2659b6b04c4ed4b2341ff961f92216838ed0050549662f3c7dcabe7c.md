Hold on a minute.  Alice is, here, 100% correct.

If I use PGP to read messages and there's a videocamera trained on the 
keyboard, and other people have access to the machine, PGP is not 
secure.  Similarly, if PGP is on a computer which other people may use 
without my supervision, they can  monitor keystrokes, etc. and PGP is not 
secure.

A chain is only as strong as its weakest link; Alice recognizes this, and 
makes no claim that PGP itself is the weak link.  The weak link is the 
physical security of the system which Alice claims to use.
