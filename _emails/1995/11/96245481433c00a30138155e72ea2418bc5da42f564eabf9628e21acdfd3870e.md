This is not correct, at least according to legal precident.  If someone who
is from Sun representes themselves as being from Sun (i.e., a Sun.Com email
address in their signature line), then when they speak (or email) about Sun,
its products, its policies, etc., they represent Sun.

There is indeed a difference, but it's not as big as you might seem to
think.  Even more importantly, there is a difference between the person
from Amalgamated Widget speaking on strong crypto and the person from
Sun speaking on Java.

In fact, employees represent the company any time they use company
names, symbols, stationary, return addresses, etc.

If the Netscape legal staff and corporate security board haven't made
this clear to management and employees, that's pretty bad.  If the
officers of Netscape haven't taken appropriate policy measures to notify
employees of this potential liability (it appears that at least they
haven't notified Phillip), then negative consequences could result in
personal liability to the officers (a shareholder lawsuit would be the
most common cause of such liability).  As a Netscape employee, you
should immediately point this out to the corporate person you report to,
and do so in writing.

This sort of lapse is a strong indicator that inadequate IT audit has
been done in Netscape.  In a comprehensive IT audit, such policy lapses
should be identified quickly and changes in corporate policies should
follow very closely.

You are still speaking for Netscape, but hopefully after reading this
message, you and your company will realize it.
