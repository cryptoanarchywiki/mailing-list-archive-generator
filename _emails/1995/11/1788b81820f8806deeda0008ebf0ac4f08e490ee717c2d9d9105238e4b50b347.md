   For we CIA-corn peckers:

   Wash Rag today hangs out Page Oner on the billions wasted on
   armaments based on flawed data by the CIA. It has pointers 
on
   how the spooks chew the raw spew and hawk oysters upstairs.

   Two, NYPaper chickenshits editorially on the same, clucks
   affirmation of Deutch and US Congress under-oversight.

   Three, contrarily, NYP's Maureen Dowd ridicules the CIA
   macho history of acceptable wickedness in the public
   interest, and hoots at Deutch's "mensch" complicity, saying
   that laughable agencies don't survive godawfully wicked
   Washington. Cackling right on, Mo.
