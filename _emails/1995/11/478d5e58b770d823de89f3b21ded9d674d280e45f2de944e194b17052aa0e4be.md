Wouldn't the ability to have the bank prove that the coins were 'cashed'
make this all null and void? The only way this would work would be if
Charlie is willing to completely forego cashing in the coins, *ever*. Should
he cash them in later, Ed would seem to have grounds for suspicion/complain.
