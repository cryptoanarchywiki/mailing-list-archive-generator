Here's a little more information on this fine publication, which is in the
forefront of the struggle to expose the truth about the United Nations'
responsibility for the bombing of the Oklahoma Federal Building. Note the
second Library of Congress topic classification. The Spotlight is often
cited in alt.revisionism. Larger University libraries usually carry it;
I know Stanford and Berkeley do.

This is not true. This is a trial balloon, not a directive;  it's a first,
wet dream draft at the beginning of a public comment period. It is dead 
on arrival.

It will not be implemented, not if we have any say in the matter, and we
do. Please do chime in, though, based on EPIC's responsible analysis and
recommendations.

This is not true.

The second and third sentences are true. If you are a US citizen (natural 
born White Sovereign State Citizen or otherwise), please follow up on 
them. Let your voice be heard.

The first sentence has at least four readily apparent logical and 
factual flaws.

Not if they're encrypted, they can't :-)

Yes, please do. The facts are rather disturbing. Clark's transcription 
leaves a little to be desired, so I quote EPIC:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:

(a) Express support for Rep. Bob Barr (R-GA), a former federal prosecutor 
and leading Congressional
opponent of the FBI's request for wiretap funding: 

     Rep. Bob Barr
     U.S. House of Representatives
     1607 Longworth Building
     Washington, DC 20515
     (202) 225-2931


(b) Submit comments to the FBI. Object to the "percentage approach" to
wiretap capacity. Urge the FBI to follow the current measurement of
wiretapping, as reported annually by the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts, which considers the actual number of wiretaps authorized. If you
are a telephone customer, ask the FBI to address the privacy risks of
unauthorized, illegal, or excessive wire surveillance. Comments should be
submitted in triplicate to the Telecommunications Industry Liaison Unit
(TILU), Federal Bureau of Investigation, P.O. Box 220450, Chantilly, VA
22022-0450. Send copies of your comments to EPIC (alert@epic.org) and
Congressman Barr. 

                 ** Comments must be received by November 15, 1995. **

(c) If you represent or work for a telecommunications company, equipment
manufacturer, or service provider, assess carefully the cost and liability
that this proposed federal regulation may impose on your company and the
risk that it may expose your customers to illegal wiretapping. If you are
interested in challenging the final FBI rule, contact EPIC.
