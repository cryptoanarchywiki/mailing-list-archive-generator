Ahh I told my self I would not reply to this but this next statement 
proved to me the "Dr. FC" has never read the Java Language Specification.

Obiously he has no idea what an object field is and what modifiers such 
as private or public do.

Also as in you flamage of Netscape you wont find answers here. If you 
really wanted answers you would post to the java mailinglist at Sun
where their engeniers would answer you questions. But its seems you dont 
really want answers. In anycase I'am crossposting this to the java 
mailing list.
