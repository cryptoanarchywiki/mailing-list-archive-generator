Has anyone tried using neural nets or similar techniques for
searching for useful nonrandom properties of the round functions of
block ciphers or hash functions?  This might be useful in trying to
prepare some new kind of attack, find a balanced binary function
that is useful in using the generalization of linear cryptanalysis
discussed by Harpes, Kramer, and Massey at Eurocrypt '95, find a
better "difference" function for use in a differential attack, etc.

Merkle's paper on Khufu and Khafre addresses this idea, I think.
Merkle comments that it's not going to be useful against a full
cipher, but that it might be useful against (say) Khufu with one or
two octets.
