The main problem I would see with this scheme is that it uses Moore's law.
I do not think that Moore's law will hold true forever.  Microchips are
becoming so small that they will eventually reach a point where they will
not be able to be any smaller without facing quantum uncertainty.  At
this point, either the increase in computer speed will stop or something
like parallel processing or quantum computers will become feasible and the
amount of compute time will be very little.  Using this type of scheme
might be usefull now, but most likely, a new law about increasing computer
power will have to be developed in the next twenty years.
