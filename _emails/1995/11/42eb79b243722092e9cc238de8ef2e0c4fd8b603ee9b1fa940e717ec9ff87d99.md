That's the rub.  Kids can be kept locked up even with no crime.  "Children
don't have a right to liberty only a right to custody."  An adult would
probably not get arrested in the same circumstances (cops have more
discretion to push kids around) or if arrested not prosecuted, or if
prosecuted, case dismissed.  

It's a good thing the kid didn't engage in racist/Nazi acts like cutting
government spending and taxes or they would have thrown the book at him.

You got that right.
