   Pal has provided a gopher-FBI paper:


   "Computer Crime Categories: How Techno-criminals Operate."
   By David L. Carter, a professor in the School of Criminal
   Justice, Michigan State University

   Types of Computer Crimes

      Computer As the Target
      Computer As the Instrumentality of the Crime
      Computer Is Incidental to Other Crimes
      Crimes Associated With the Prevalence of Computers

   Perspective on Legal Issues

   Special Problems with Computer-Related Crime

      Intellectual Property
      Malfeasance by Computer
      International Issues

   Conclusion

      Criminals have adapted the advancements of computer
      technology to further their own illegal activities.
      Unfortunately, their actions have far out-paced the
      ability of police to respond effectively.
