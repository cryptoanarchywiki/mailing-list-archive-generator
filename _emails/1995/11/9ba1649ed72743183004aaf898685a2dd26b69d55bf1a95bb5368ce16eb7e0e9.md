Hi,

I am currently preparing a paper on payment systems for the Internet
and related issues.  I recently found out that so-called observers could
be placed on smart cards (in order to prevent double spending, or even to
prevent people from cheating on taxes...).

To be honest that's about all I know about observers and I am very eager
to find out more.  I am, however, having a hard time finding interesting
references on this subject.

Hence, all suggestions to get me started would be extremely welcome.
Questions of particular interest are: possible functions (and limits),
how 'real' are they already?, what about privacy?, ...

Many thanks in advance.
