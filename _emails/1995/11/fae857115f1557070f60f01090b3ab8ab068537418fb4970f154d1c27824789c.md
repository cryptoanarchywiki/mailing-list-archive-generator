And the efforts are appreciated. Of course, your original efforts can
still be appreciated at utopia.hacktic.nl. 

I don't know about everyone else, but that TCP encryption sounded
interesting. Any plans to discuss it on the list?

POT-KETTLE-BLACK.

Also, since nothing you've written (in your commentary, as opposed to
anonymous announcements or releases that most people use anonymity for
here) indicates that you're using anonymity for any particular reason,
please stop so people can killfile you. Or send it from a nym at
alpha.c2.org. I mean, the NSA has your real name anyway, what's the
point...

Hmm, I guess most of them at least had the sense to not send it to the
list. The list still sees FAR too many personal queries and rebuttals. TO
THE GUILTY: take your bonehead replies to email please.

Jay: I had a similar experience when I mentioned elsewhere that all the
primes under 1000 digits were really invented by the NSA over 20 years
ago. I recommended wearing garlic around the neck for protection... 

Everyone: This 1% wiretap thing is getting old. Hint hint hint

Lastly, regarding cpunk icons, the only ones I was able to find were at
the BAP site. I've been drawing a few of my own, one of them is done. It's
a yellow diamond that says Cypherpunk on Board. And it has the anarchy-A-
inside-a-C symbol. It's interlaced and transparent, so it doesn't look too
bad. You're all welcome to steal it at http://students.cs.byu.edu/~don.
Also working on a PGP icon. BAP has an envelope with PGP being the seal. I
was thinking maybe a deadbolt ("PGP") with the inscription "Mommy said to
lock the doors at night" or some kind of safety lock-your-doors or
lock-your-data reference. 

For the time being I'm working on a simple PGP/ZLDF icon, it will be
on my page Real Soon Now[tm]. If you like my icons please tell me.

Don
