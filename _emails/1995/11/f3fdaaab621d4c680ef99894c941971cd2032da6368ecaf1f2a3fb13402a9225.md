Well, don't assume that because something's a "violation of ITAR's INTENT"
it is actually a violation of ITAR.    It can't be assumed that ITAR is
_perfect_:  That it actually prohibits every activity the government that
wrote it didn't like.

Sure about this?!?

I didn't say that the code would ever be "re-exported":  A copy would be
brought into the US for domestic use, and everyone else outside the border
would get their own copy from an outside server.

It is for this kind of problem that I "invented" my concept of
"Assassination Politics":  If everybody pissed off at this situation was
willing to donate $10 to a fund to reward the deaths of a few government
officials responsible for ITAR, I can well imagine that this would shake
them up a bit.
