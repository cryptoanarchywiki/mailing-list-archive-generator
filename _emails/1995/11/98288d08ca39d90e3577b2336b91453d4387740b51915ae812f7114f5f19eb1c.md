Before someone corrects me:

I wrote:

"Exceptions are the cases when an anonymous source has something
"sensitive" to contribute, such as the release of the putative MD4 code,
and the like."

MD or RC4, I forget which it was. My point is that anonymity has been used
to post stuff like this (putatively), and that this is a "good" use of
anonymity. Good in the sense of being non-flamish, non-infantile.

(Not everyone thinks using anonymous posts to "liberate" intellectual
property is a "good" thing, but then I'm sure a lot of people don't think
it's good that the secrets of how to fix plumbing are written up in books
for all to read.)
