no, he isn't.  He isn't even using a minimal effort to prevent spoofing, and
he's blaming this on the fact that some particular piece of software (for
example, PGP) isn't absolutely foolproof.

True but irrelevant.  This is especially true since the only purpose to
signing messages to a public area is to prevent spoofing.  If somebody does,
indeed, figure out how to break (say) a 1024-bit PGP key and "Alice" gets
spoofed, HE WILL KNOW because he will see a message with his signature that
HE KNOWS he didn't send.  At that point, he will at least be able to reduce
the number of spoofed messages to 1 before he alerts us that there is a
problem.  We won't necessarily know who to believe, of course, but we will
know that one of a number of this is probably true:

1  "Alice" is lying to us.   (by far the most likely.)

2.  Somebody actually has physical access to "Alice's" machine and is
actively using it to spoof messages.

3.  Somebody found out how to break 1024-bit PGP keys easily.  (Very
unlikely, of course.)

But "Alice" resists using ANY chain at all!
