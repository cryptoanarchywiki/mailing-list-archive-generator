If you've been following my idea, "assassination politics," you know that
there is an excellent use for payee-anonymous digital cash.  

It seems to me that this should be possible, within limits, if the potential
payee could generate a "blinded" note to be delivered to the payer by
anonymous means.  The payer could get the note certified by the bank,
possibly given an extra "blind" if necessary  (is this possible? Desirable?
Why not?) and then the resulting still-blinded but certified note is posted
(in encrypted form, I supposed) to the 'net so that only the payee can
decrypt and unblind it.
