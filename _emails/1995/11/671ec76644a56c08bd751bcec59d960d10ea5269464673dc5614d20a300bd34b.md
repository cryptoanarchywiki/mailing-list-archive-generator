Personally, I have long had great _hopes_ for using crypto for
non-sanctioned gambling, but I'm pretty skeptical that many people will do
it. For one thing, anyone knowledgeable enough to be comfortable with the
crytography knows that gambling when a house cut exists is a lose. (And
gambling with no house cut is, at best, a wash.)
-----------------------
	How about gambling on something other than random numbers? Idea Futures
are one instance, as is sports gambling for those interested in that sort of
thing.
