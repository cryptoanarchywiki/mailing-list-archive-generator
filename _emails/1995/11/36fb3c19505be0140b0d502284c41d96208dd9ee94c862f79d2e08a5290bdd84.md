This is the induction case, not the base case. It assumes that you've 
already got a bunch of trusted public keys in your database. It also 
assumes the willingness of the ownsers of those public keys to sign new 
keys. See, now they've got the same problem of trying to determine 
whether the key is valid. Turtles all the way down.

There being no reason, of course, why Mallet couldn't just sign all that 
stuff with his own signature. Here, you're relying on the ability of data 
to authenticate itself.

I am simply proposing a third alternative that has neither of these
problems: a short unique name for the key. Its success relies on
alternate, non-digital forms of communication: the phone, ink-signed
paper, face to face, whatever.
