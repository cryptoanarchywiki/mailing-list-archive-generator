There were two names on the MD5 document -- mine and Bill
Simpson's. Bill didn't tell me that he was called (I suspect he would
have), and I wasn't called, either. We were the only two editors of
that portion of the specification.

Given that my name was on that document and that I made a large effort
to try to make sure that people examined the algorithms and thought
they were good, and that I have some of my reputation tied to that
document, I am rather unhappy at the fact that I only find out third
hand about what people in the field have determined about our selected
algorithm.

I know. I was one of the designers. We all understood extremely well
that crypto algorithms become rapidly obsolete. However, we needed to
specify a reasonably strong baseline transform that would be widely
deployed. I was shocked at the level of trouble we had in getting the
cryptoweenies to successfully agree on a keyed hash based transform no
matter how long was spent on the topic. I've got to say that my
opinion of the academic crypto community dropped substantially after
the experience. I would have thought that people could at least have
agreed on what they knew and didn't know.  This was strikingly
different from my experience with other mathematical fields, in which
the experts seem to agree pretty readily about what is and isn't
known.

People might have noted their suspicions to us. As engineers, we are
capable of avoiding something based on on suspected weakness without
solid confirmation -- we aren't trying to publish papers, we are
trying to get things to work.
