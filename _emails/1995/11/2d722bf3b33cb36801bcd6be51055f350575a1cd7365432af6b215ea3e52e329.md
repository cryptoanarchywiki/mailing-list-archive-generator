Still, anonymous does make an astutely ironic observation, in 
humorous lifting of the customary FinCEN cloak:


That the hydra-headed agency may be literally aim at financial 
*crimes* enforcement rather than enforcement of the laws 
against such deeds.


Especially given the participating renegade agencies who seem 
to absolve themselves of these laws.


Perhaps anonymous is right, they are a band of outlaws, daring 
to overtly flaunt it, expecting no opposition from the gullible 
cowed.
