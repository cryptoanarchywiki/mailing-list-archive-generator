All of these articles from people claiming to be me!

I repeat, for the slow learners, that I consider PGP to be untrustworthy, at least on my machines. I don't want those Mounties to do to me what they did to Mulroney en passant. 

You in the southern colony are free to use PGP, but I prefer other means of establishing my uniqueness. Style, for example, cannot be easily copied.

I am, as always, 


  Alice de 'nonymous ...
  
                                    ...just another one of those...
