Note the change in fact pattern: now both foreigners are IN the US where 
indeed they are subject to US law.  My bet: the court has no trouble 
applying the ITAR to these facts and convicting.  I agree this is a 
little silly; but not silly enough to stop it.  [The government will 
argue, and win, as follows: suppose there is no law against murder in 
either of the nations they come from.  Does that mean they can kill each

This issue is now in front of two district judges.

Won't need it.  He has committed no offense.  If his petition is turned 
down, he has a right of action.

Without evidence, they will lose.  Even with evidence, not obvious he has 
done anything wrong.

They lose.  You distinguish it easily ("Now where exactly was the

Ah. Terminological confusion.  That's not a constitutional violation.  
It's an agency misconstruing a statute, renderinig the regulations invalid.
See the Administrative Procedures Act....

It's too far off topic to pursue any further, but I must take exception 
to the suggestion that we are well served by separation of powers 
intruding into other legal domains.  Bowsher tells us that causation 
principles go out the window in SOP cases.  That alone makes it radioactive.
