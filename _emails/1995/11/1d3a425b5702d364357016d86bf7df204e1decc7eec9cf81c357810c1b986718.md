   Kiosks."

      The Postal Service predicted "more than 10,000" kiosks
      could be installed in post offices, libraries and
      shopping malls "within the next few years." The Postal
      Service is the lead government agency on the project,
      one of several administration initiatives designed to
      provide the public with computer access to government
      information.

      yesterday endorsing the "concept" of consolidating eight
      defense and intelligence agencies -- those responsible
      for managing spy satellite photos and related tasks --
      into a new National Imagery and Mapping Agency.
