I agree.  I doubt we can completely eliminate the risk by technical fixes. 
I do think we may be able to reduce the risk below what it is in
non-cyberspace commerce.  (e.g. phone orders and in-person card
presentation).  If we can do that, and a significant part of commerce moves
to cyberspace, then we can see a reduction in the fraud premium that we all
pay (no matter who "offically" pays for it).

While cash-like instruments will be an important part of cyberspace, I
think that credit arangements may be more important.  In non-cyberspace
commerce, almost all big-ticket purchases are made with time-payment
credit.  Whether the total of the "candy bar" transactions will exceed the
total to the big-ticket transactions, I don't know.  Certainly if we are
dealing with tangable goods, shipping costs encourage large orders.
