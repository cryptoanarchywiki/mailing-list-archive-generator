All true.

A green card, by itself, also fails to prove legal status.

Proving legal residency requires a combination of two documents, one each
from specified lists. Most commonly a driver's license, green card (which
is actually pink), or birth certificate from list A, and a social
security card from list B. 

Chris Hibbert's SSN FAQ talks a little bit about how this works, and why
it's a Good Thing. Basically, for privacy and security reasons, it is a
very good idea to separate the issues of identity and authorization.

I don't care how securely you can authenticate who I am -- by PGP, retinal
scan, whatever. I do not want a single digitizable token to be the key to
my identity. Even if that identity cannot be forged (and everything can be
forged), it can be used to track me, by the government, by the Direct
Marketing Association, by the private investigators of certain wacky
cults, and by TRW. And I suppose by those secret government types at SAIC
who, we are told, control the Internet now :-)

It is a little inconvenient, but this is why it's a Good Thing that you
need a separate driver's license, social security card, credit card, phone
number, PGP key, password, thumbprint, and retina. I would oppose moves to
combine them to a single unified "mark of the beast," as it were. I am a
little uneasy about the otherwise very cool First Bank of the Internet for
this reason. If you use FBOI, I'd recommend using a PGP key separate from 
your usual PGP key.

Crypto fans need to recognize that the ability to securely prove your 
identity is not an unmitigated advance.

Of course, all the crypto fans here are also pseudonym fans.

This is a job for private key cryptography, like kerberos.
