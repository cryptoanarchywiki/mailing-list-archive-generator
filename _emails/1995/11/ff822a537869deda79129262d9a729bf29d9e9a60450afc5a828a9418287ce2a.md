  I was posting here before your supposed "flaw" was posted.  I have never
been told that I should or should not participate on this list by anyone
at netscape.

  Please show us some proof.  All you have done is post unfounded allegations
backed up by flawed logic and a misunderstanding of the technology.  Send me
a URL, and I will point my navigator at it.  If you can collect my PGP key ring
you can gloat here or anywhere else.
