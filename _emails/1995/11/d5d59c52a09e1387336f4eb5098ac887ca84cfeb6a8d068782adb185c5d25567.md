It is a well-known fact that it was common practice for NSA operatives to
masquerade as Injuns in the 1800's and waylay Pony Express riders in order
to intercept communications between targeted parties. This practice lost
popularity towards the end of the century with the advent of boxed cereal,
and with it the Lone Ranger Decoder Ring, since the operatives were too
underfunded to afford anything more than oatmeal.
