I'm sure that most lawyers are probably advising Netscape's founders
to not respond -- just like Fuhrman, they should take the fifth
on this one. 

Hopefully everyone's D&O premiums are fully paid up ... 'cause to me this
smells like a failure to disclose a material event.  Netscape stock has
advanced almost 50% since the Bugs Bunny post. 

Some investors are gonna be mighty pissed.

Then again, what would I know ...
