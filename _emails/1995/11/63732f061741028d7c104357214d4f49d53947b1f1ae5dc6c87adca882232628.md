   based on an article from the (London) Financial Times [available from
John Young at jya@pipeline.com with subject line WAY_lad],

   a very credible white paper is circulating for the WTO to establish an 
internet CZAR to regualate the Internet and level the playing field world 
wide. 

   personally, the Feds and the FCC are bad enough --now they want to 
have a **global** bureaucracy play god  -???

   are we ready to go back to UUCP?
