Thanks. That's pretty much what we are doing -- requiring a particular
1024-bit modulus but recommending several others as options. There's a
2048 bit optional modulus and may even be a 4096-bit option if I can
find one in reasonable time. There was going to be a 512-bit optional
modulus but the group has reacted so strongly to it that I'm willing to
withdraw it.
