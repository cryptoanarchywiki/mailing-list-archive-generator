I don't buy this argument.  The only reason "foofoo" could have less
entropy than "foobar" is if the attacker had some reason to know that
the user tends to choose doubled passwords, or something like that.

If the user has historically chosen passwords with roughly six bits of
entropy per character, then "foofoo" is exactly as likely as "foobar",
and is no "weaker" from an information-theoretic perspective.

In fact, information theory would generally note that discarding the
"foofoo" choice slightly reduces the entropy in the password.

It is also worth noting that any good password algorithm doesn't permit
one to determine if the password is _partly_ right, so entropy
measurements can't really meaningfully be made on a per-character
basis, only on the password as a whole.

It is because the attacker knows that many (if not most) users tend to
prefer passwords that are "easier to remember" that leads him to try
the more memorable combinations *first*.  The information-theoretic
interpretation of this is that such memorable passwords have less
entropy than the others, because the probability that the next account
an attacker tries to guess uses a memorable password is higher than the
probability that it doesn't.

"foobar" occurs as a password less frequently than "foofoo", so it has
more entropy.  The extra entropy didn't come from the use of more
characters, it came from all the more lazy users who like "foofoo"
better.

To use a variant of Tim's example, "7f#qp)djQ10hB%3t+1?U4SVp5" is not
measurably better than "7f#q#)d#Q10h#%#t+1#U4S#p5", even though the
latter uses the "#" character much more frequently than the first.
Both passwords are so far down the list that they probably have never
occurred as passwords.  Both contain effectively the same entropy.

To address the original question:
>>Do repeated words in a PGP passphrase make the pass phrase less secure than
>>a passphrase without any repeated words?

Probably not.  It may even increase security, as "the quick brown fox"
is more frequently used than "the quick quick brown fox" as someone's
password, and should, therefore, be tried first.

>>And on the same note, do repeated
>>letters in a UNIX password make that password easier to break?

Again, probably not.  If the letters are generally chosen at random,
then "abafraa" is just as likely to occur as "abifryu".  If the letters
are chosen less randomly, like from a name, then "anna" is more likely
than "xavier", but less likely than "john".
