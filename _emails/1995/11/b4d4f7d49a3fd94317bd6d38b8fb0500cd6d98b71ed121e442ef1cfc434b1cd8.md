The ITAR is a regulation, not a law.  You can find it via my crypto
export control page at http://www.cygnus.com/~gnu/export.html under
"State Department export guidance".  Or at
ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/export/itar.in.full.  It's 380 kbytes
(but ignorance of it is no excuse!).

That regulation is authorized by the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), a
law (22 USC Sec. 2778).  The law is also available in the same places.
It's only 40 Kbytes.

I own and can recommend several books on export controls.

Layman's books on general export controls and technology policy issues:

90-26801:   Finding common ground : U.S. export controls in a changed
     global environment /  Washington, D.C. : National Academy Press, 1991.
     xviii, 390 p. : ill. ; 24 cm.
     LC CALL NUMBER: HF1414.5 .F56 1991

87-34877:   Technology transfer : a policy model / Philip A. Roberts.
     Washington, DC : National Defense University Press, 1988.  xiii, 86 p.
     ; 21 cm.  LC CALL NUMBER: HC110.T4 R62 1988 SERIES TITLE: A National
     security essay DEWEY DEC: 338.973/06 dc19

93-50697:   Silencing science : national security controls and scientific
     communication / Harold C. Relyea.  Norwood, NJ : Ablex Pub., c1994. 
     xvii, 248 p. ; 23 cm.  LC CALL NUMBER: Q223 .R45 1994.  
     SERIES TITLE: Information management, policy, and services.
     DEWEY DEC:  338.97306 dc20.  ISBN:  156750096X; 1567500978 (pbk.)

Lawyer's Tome on export controls, with detailed case citations and such:

91-37498: Root, William A.  United States export controls /  3rd ed.
     Englewood Cliffs, NJ : Prentice Hall Law & Business, c1991-  1 v.
     (loose-leaf) : ill. ; 26 cm.  ISBN:  0139529381
     LC CALL NUMBER: KF1987 .L54 1990.  DEWEY DEC:  353.0082/76 dc20
     [This one is loose-leaf and gets annual updates at $80/year.  I forget
      how much it cost originally.]

By the way, if you're trying to find general references on export
controls or crypto, or anything else, I recommend
`telnet://locis.loc.gov' and searching the Library of Congress card
catalog or the copyright records.  The user interface is IBM mainframe
oriented, but the information is without peer.
