In addition to the large quantity they want, they also want to be able to
deliver the conversation from a mobile suspect to mobile agents who are
following the suspect.  So even if you use a digital set with "voice
privacy" activated that government car behind you might still be listening
to you.

The FBI's "requirements" present an entertaining set of logistical
problems.  Simply equipping the switches to handle the extra capacity,
especially during busy hour, is problematic.
