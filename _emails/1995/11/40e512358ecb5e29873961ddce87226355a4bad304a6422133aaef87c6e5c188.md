I am inclined to agree with Perry in as much as the volume of posts to
the cypherpunks list is greatly increased by reposts of news from
other mailing lists, USENET newsgroups, WWW sources, newspapers, TV
programs, films, books, talks, etc.  While some of the information
posted is interesting, and relevant, some others are less relevant,
bordering on noise.

It is much more efficient of list bandwidth to post short pointers
only, of the style John Young <jya@pipeline.com> posts.  Or an
alternative I have been thinking might be useful: a separate list.

The proposal: a separate list for current-event reports/news/reposts.

I think it would be useful if a separate mailing list were set up on
toad.com, called say "cypherpunks-news@toad.com" (or whatever) to
distinguish it from the main cypherpunks list.

That way people who aren't interested to read reposts just don't
subscribe to cypherpunks-news, and those who want to catch up on
cypherpunks related current events, media reports etc, can browse
through the archives for cypherpunks-news.

What do others think?

Adam
