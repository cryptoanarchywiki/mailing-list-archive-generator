outside of a lot of traditional metrics and hard to authenticate even if
it were simple to measure. Forrester sites 250 million retail and $90

Activmedia - www.activmedia.com - does regular surveys. I just got a 
breathless press release for their latest one - "WEB COMMERCE UP 1900%." 
Someone must have bought tickets the lastest George Forman comeback fight 
or something from a ticketron on-line kiosk. . .
