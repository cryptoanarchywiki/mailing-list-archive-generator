	It seems that they use signatures & hashes; nice work, a good
advance for medical records storage, but I'd ask how keys are managed,
and also what prevents me exploiting the 'hash-only' mode of sending
in what I'm cliaming to be is an emergency.  (Not that these
invalidate the system; they're just interesting areas to work on.)

|    The private code, known only to the individual to whom the information
|    is transmitted, is 1,024 computer bits long, Wong said.
|    
|    In emergencies where fast transmission is needed, the unscrambled
|    image is transmitted with a digital "fingerprint," a smaller code that
|    assures the intended viewer that no one has altered the original
|    image.
