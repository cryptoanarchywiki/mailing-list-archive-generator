I choose to make these 'off-topic' comments off the record:
 
(By the way, please keep on 'crypto-moderating' the list
 your way; it makes much more sense - and is much more

Well, also in Sweden, but this is merely against tax money transfered to
the 'less fortunate' (or 'lazy', as you sometimes call them) and is very
little, if at all, connected to anti-surveillance. Cross-referencing
various databases would actually be good for catching those who receive,
for example, unemploment money while actually working full time (especially
common amongst Mediterranian and Middle East 'political' refugees - many
of whom like to come here and work for a handful of years, sometimes adding
a decade to their actual age so they can go home to a warm climate at 55
to live as kings on their Swedish pensions). Isn't this a dilemma, also at
your home turf? FINCEN efficiency might save some of your tax dollars.

I completely agree with you - actually, I think I took over some arguments
from you on this subject long ago - that these laws are bullshit.

This applies very much so in Sweden too. It *is* illegal to maintain any
database with 'information on persons' (like their email addresses) without
approval from the Data Inspection. But it's an open secret that this law
is broken on a massive front and no bureaucrat is really trying to uphold it.

Yes, we live in interesting times.
