I think the problem is not merely flooding the device with non-random
input data.  If you coordinate sucking out entropy with feeding in
non-random data you can suck the real entropy in the system down to zero
while making the driver think it has plenty of randomness.  While it's
not clear to me how this would lead to an attack, it would be worrisome.
