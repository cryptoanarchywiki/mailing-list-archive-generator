The front of the ITAR has this convenient phone number you can call
to get a copy: 1 703 875 6644.  I don't think anyone on this list can
claim ignorance. :)  BTW, as for Pegasus, please note that I didn't say
the author was going to get in trouble, merely that his software is
export controlled -- there's a difference.
