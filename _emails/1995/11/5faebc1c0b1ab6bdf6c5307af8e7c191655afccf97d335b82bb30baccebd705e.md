To be strictly correct, there were no cops in the english speaking world
from the time of the saxon invasions to the nineteenth century.  There
were however the functional equivalent of cops at some places, and 
some times -- mostly in societies that collapsed or sank into utter 
tyranny.

One can reasonably argue that the persians and scythians 
etc were nation states, and that sometimes nation states 
existed during the dark ages and medieval period, but until 
fairly recently, most of what we now call western civilization 
regarded what we would now call a nation state as a rare, 
curious, and pathological aberration.

I expect that we will soon once again regard them as 
pathological, and I hope that we will be able to regard
them as rare.
