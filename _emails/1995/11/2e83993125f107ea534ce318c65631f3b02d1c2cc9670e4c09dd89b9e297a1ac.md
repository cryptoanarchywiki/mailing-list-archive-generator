So use PGP, sign your messages.  Simple solution.

This post wasn't signed off, but I presume you are "Alice d'nonymous",
it would help lots if you could get yourself an account with a nym
server, such as alpha@c2.org.  That would have the advantages that
your email address would be recognizable, and that people could reply
to you if they wanted to.

If having a working reply address bothers you, well at least sign your
posts, if you're concerned about a persistant identity, the tools are
available to do it.  Complaining about things which have simple
technological solutions won't get you much sympathy.
