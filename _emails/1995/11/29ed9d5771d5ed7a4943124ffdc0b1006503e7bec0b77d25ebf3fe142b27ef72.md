Yes it would be hard. When you choose your own protection as above an
opponent would have to mount a significant effort just to get your stuff.

Yes, but if your particular habits became widespread, an intelligence
agency could amortize the virus effort across many victims.

Here is just one such complicated virus:
Sit in the OS watching for PGP to be launched. Patch PGP on the way in. The
patch writes to disk the location and password for the secure key ring.
Concurrently the virus watches for there to be IP service and sends the
disk information as a UDP.
Alternatively the virus waits for idle time, (screen saver time) and dials
an 800 number having turned off the modem speaker. But don't send the same
data twice!

There is a significant hazard for the virus producer here if someone finds
the code and learns the 800 number. I am sure that the Telco would help
locate the physical phone to which the 800 number led. UDP provides more
ways to pigeon drop the secret so as to protect the reader of that data.
Perhaps you can send the UDP to the NY-Times (or to your favorite enemy)
over a line that you are tapping. The NYT will discard it and no one is the
wiser. The virus is then anonymous.
