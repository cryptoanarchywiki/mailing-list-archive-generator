Friend, 
 
 
11 27 95 Press Association News in the UK reports: 
 
   STORM AS SPY CAMERA `JUICY BITS' SET FOR SALE 
 
 
"Furious MPs are demanding action," cries the story.  Why? 
 
   Their anger follows a row over the sale in video shops of 
   "juicy bits" from closed circuit TV cameras fixed in high 
   streets and stores to detect crime. 
 
 
High streets: where the fashionable retail shops are. 
 
   One extract showed a couple having sex in a doorway, 
   unaware they were being watched. 
 
 
It wasn't me, Mums, I swear! 
 
A Liberal Democrat family spokeswoman: 
 
   "That this sale has been allowed is a disgrace and will 
   undermine the trust the public has in cameras designed 
   to cut crime." 
 
 
A Labour MP: 
 
   "This situation plainly leaves people wide open to black- 
   mail." 
 
 
He said "some of his constituents in Linlithgow had recently
been compromised by such a video." 
 
A sly dog at the Home Office: 
 
   "We have not seen the video [good move!], but judging from 
   what has been said about it, it would have to be classified 
   by the British Board of Film Classification if it is being sold." 
 
 
If we don't have privacy, we do have censorship! 
 
But Mums, I swear... 
 
 
Cordially, 
 
Jim
