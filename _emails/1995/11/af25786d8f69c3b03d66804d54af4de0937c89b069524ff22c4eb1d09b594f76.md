David Friedman is now teaching law at Santa Clara University, over in
Silicon Valley. We've been in contact, and expect to meet for dinner
sometime soon. (He attended a special Cypherpunks meeting a few years ago.)

Ah, but the Cyberia list is a _law_ list, and political discussion is
discouraged.

His "Machinery of Freedom" and many other articles clearly establishes him
as a leader in this area. He didn't previously know a lot about strong
crypto, but now he sees that this makes many of the abstract ideas of
"Machinery" near at hand.

Vernor Vinge believes the same thing.
