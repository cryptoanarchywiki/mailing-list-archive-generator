  The paper suggested that you have two different keys, one for 
encryption and the other for signatures, and you don't mix the two up, so 
that way you are protecting yourself from someone forging your 
signature, but you are not letting them know what your private key is.
  Make sense?  I would suggest that you read the paper, as it is really 
an excellent document.
