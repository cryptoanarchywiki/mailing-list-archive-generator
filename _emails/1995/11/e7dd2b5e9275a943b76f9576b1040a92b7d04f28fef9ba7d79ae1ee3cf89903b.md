	<attila> someone suggested a new list --moderated. My concern, so
circulated, is that whoever (including backups to cover vacations and 
travel) accepts the responsibility must not thrash any of the code posts. 
My suggestion for making the list effective is to always post to c|punks, 
even if you are on the code list which means "cypherpunks" is still the 
same; who ever is doing the moderating then forwards all the code threads 
to "cypherpunks.moderated"  --you get the best of both worlds.

    	<attila> no doubt. for instance, whoever put c|punks on the 
    ACLUNATL@aol.com biweekly list would just hit both and that one cannot
    be unsubscribed except by the original subscriber. however, that one is
    concise -let's hope we do not get hit with "digitaliberty," "VTW" or any
    of the rest of the prolific slammers/day. 

    	the issue as pointed out above is a separate moderated and 
    non-postable list.

	<attila>  but is not the charter of the list "cypherpunks write 
    code" an issue. I don't go as far as Perry on irrelevancy (and Perry 
    breaks his own commandment at will --as do I).

	<attila> that may be true, but it is annoying enough that I use
    'procmail' to waste the lists (and Dr. Fred) before they even make the
    message list.  AND, 'procmail' separates all the mailing list into
    separate folders on the way in --I have not read a newsgroup for
   almost a year unless I am looking for something very specific.

	<attila>  any one with a political agenda is going to cross post 
    any list which, in their opinion, might be an audience. the ACLU
    post today is obvious --freedom of speech and congressional action to
    effectively shut down the internet, which certainly falls within our 
    mainstream "interests."

	<attila> this is a valid concern. the last figure I saw for lists 
    was 12,000+.  if some of them do not overlap, where did they find
    12,000 topics worthy of a mail list? as I said, procmail takes care of
    the yeoman's portion, but it is not the be all to end all either. I'm
    not at the point of writing an ai based preprocessor which analyzes
    the content of the folders before invoking my mail reader, but how far
    off is that? information may be key to survival, but...
