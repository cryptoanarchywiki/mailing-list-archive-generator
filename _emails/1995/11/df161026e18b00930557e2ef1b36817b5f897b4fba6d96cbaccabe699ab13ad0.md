      I see <A> the flames of a bunch of brats with a lot of disposable
income, and <B> a sysop culture armed with buckets of water they'd rather
not use lest it short out their technocratic "ethics."

      In GROUP politics. Libertarianism is recursively structured: "when
there's no gubmint" -- I ain't holding my breath -- they won't trust
themselves.

      To paraquote one of my favorite lesbians, a meme is a meme is a meme
is a meme is a meme. The idea that memes will change the world is very
typical of our era, which is to say very naive. Warren works, TCM plays;
Warren works, and TCM -- who, it's abundantly clear, is brilliant in his
own way -- gambles: gambles that the memes he's "trademarked" might pan
out.

      Not really: libbies would rather play a low-stakes game with their
own back yard than a high-stakes game with society, in which everyone is
in each others' back yard.

      Trashed *as a tentacle*.
      Crypto as a litmus test isn't interesting: crypto is a means to an
end. What is that end? For too many, it is "antigovernment" -- that is,
reactionary.

      Perry has grime under his fingernails. Perry works, works with other
people toward definable ends: Perry is, among other things, a craftsman.
And if I'm not mistaken, he lives in a place where he gets to see how many
people live, and how they live together; this is very different from
*choosing to* live where and how TCM does. (Is this a "scurrilous attack,"
in TCM's words? Or is it just the expression of an opinion? Dr. Fred may
be an oaf, but the *reaction* to him demonstrates just how stupid it is to
say anything that doesn't toe the line on *this* list, despite all the
I-and-thou mumbojumbo.)

      "Replacing" is a participle: what is the agent? If the agent is an
individual, or an alienated mass of individuals, it will not be able to
replace the govt; if, OTOH, it's a mass of ORGANIZED individuals, it is no
longer libertarian.

      This is crypto-anarchy, with "crypto-" meaning what it does to most
of the pople who use it: X passing as Y, a crypto-fascist for example. And
"infiltrate" is nothing more than a fancy word for working within the
system, namely, reformism.

      Yes: this hostility to organization is an old thread in American
culture. Its usually associated with antiurbanism, anticosmopolitanism,
things like that, but most libbies I've ever met (which is a lot) are
mnore anti-control than pro-freedom. You do the math.

      Cynical? How about naive?

      If you haven't seen any proof that it can't be reformed, then you
haven't looked at the piechart on the back of the 1040 booklet.

      "Encryption is a right" reveals that crypto-libbies are honkey-man
analogs of PC creeps: everything is a right.

      Don't bother putting anything on. He's a tool, a chump to his own
megalomania: I'd love to see that pussy get elected. The moment someone
sneezed, he'd set up a howl louder than a cat with a firecracker up its
butt. He's just as snively as anyone else these days.
