"Cluttering up the namespace" is a growing problem. Fortunately, the InterNIC has taken on the important task of registering pseudonyms, and will coordinate the issuance of new pseudonyms with the Postal Service.

[The issuance of these items is temporarily on hold due to the Government Shutdown (tm).]

The fee for this will likely be quite reasonable, in the $300/year range, consistent with SAIC's plans for other emerging markets.

The InterNIC also sees great promise in collecting fees for .sig blocks, tentatively priced at $10 per line per year. As SAIC Chairman Bobby Ray Inman points out, this is the easiest way to control the proliferation of long .sig blocks.
