  Do you have a legal opinion to support this statement?  Our lawyers
tell us that executives of netscape could go to jail if we make the
128bit version of netscape available from an "export controlled"
ftp or http server.  We are working to clarify the situation with
the government or figure out an alternative distribution scheme that
will remove us from the grey area.

  Getting the US version of netscape widely available is one of my
highest priorities, but I can't tell Barksdale that he should go to
jail over it.  I'm constantly pushing from within the company to keep
things moving forward.

  In the mean time I appologize to the linux users who can't even
buy the 128 bit version.  If something changes on this front I'll
be sure to let people know.
