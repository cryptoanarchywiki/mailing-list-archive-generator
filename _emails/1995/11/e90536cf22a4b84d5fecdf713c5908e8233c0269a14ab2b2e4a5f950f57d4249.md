Doesn't sound good.

What I would suggest is accumulating enough data that you think you
have enough entropy for one hash function's worth of output, hash it,
and put that into an output queue. Then don't reuse the data, or if
you do, reuse it in combination with enough new data that you think
the new data has one hash function output's worth of entropy.
