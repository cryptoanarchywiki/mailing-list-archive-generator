I don't see a computer-understandable way to do that either -- but you have
provided an example of a human-readable way in your prior paragraph:

>			     I just added a key to my key ring that I will

You could sign a small message consisting of:

	a) that paragraph
	b) the subject public key (or its good-enough hash)
	c) your public key (or its good-enough hash)

with your key and let that attribute declaration do the job.  It would only
be humans who could interpret it, but in the end it's humans who need to.
The computer should be able to find and use (b) and (c) -- but leave the
human to interpret (a).

I grant that they'd rather let the machine do the thinking for them, but
that may not be possible -- especially at this time in the evolution of
generally available security, before we learn patterns to codify in
computer-understandable abbreviations.
