I am proposing that all cypherpunks planning on attending the meeting email
me their PGP key fingerprint between now and noon on the 29th.  I'll
collate them and print enough copies of the fingerprint checklist for all
who've announced that they're planning to attend.  At the meeting, you can
verify (or not, not my business, really) the fingerprints with the other
attendees.  Afterwards, we'll exchange keys via email and sign them at home
and mail them back to their owners.  I'll set up an email list so that each
person can email out their key once they've merged all the signatures.

Suggestions as to how to streamline this process are welcome.

For more information on the meeting, contact Jim at liberty@gate.net
