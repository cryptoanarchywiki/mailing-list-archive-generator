Today's New York Times has a nice article in the business section
about credit card security on the Internet. It's more of an editorial
than an article, but it's an editorial with the (IMNSHO) right spin:
shipping a credit card number over the Internet, even unencrypted, is
no less secure than giving it out over the phone.

The NYT has been doing a nice job covering computer issues in the past
few months, in the Monday's business section. Worth reading if you
want to keep an eye on intelligent media coverage of the net.
