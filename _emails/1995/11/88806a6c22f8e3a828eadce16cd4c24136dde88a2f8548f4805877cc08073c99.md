Yo Fred, nobody said you wer not right on the money, just that these issues
clearly have fixes and are part and parcel to a pre-adolesencent product,
not a mature one.

Yes, you get two points for posting the bug report, but lose one for
soap-boxing about the woes of the product in general... Keep up the good
work, just drop the proslitizing and we all wouldn't mind hearing your rap.


BTW - If your or your friends are up for a game of speed-chess... I'm
willing, I used to be *rated* until I dropped off the circuit a few years
ago... Winged Benoni, Classical Ruy, or maybe an Accellerated Dragon (for
those who play the black)... I won't even charge you the nominal 5$ fee...

>> We have found several security problems in the 1.0 alpha 3 release of

>> HotJava does not enforce the stated limits on where an applet can connect to

>> and HotJava is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, where someone can

>
>Two of the Java attacks I outlined in this forum and got abuse for.

>> While HotJava prevents applets from actively opening connections that

>> HotJava also allows an applet to set the proxy servers that the browser
