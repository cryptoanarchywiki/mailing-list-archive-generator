The existance of MAE East in Virginia is far more significant.

I'm sure the spooks are spying, but they are likely just tapping
lines. Machines that don't have proper reverse maps show up every day
in large networks and aren't something to worry about. Your posting is
based on the premise that this unnamed machine is of significance --
and it almost certainly isn't of any significance.

Quit looking for the spooks where they aren't. You should always
assume your line is being tapped if you are saying something you don't
want heard, anway.
