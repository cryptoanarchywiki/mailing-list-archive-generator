 This really should be cross posted to 'the future will be easy to use'
too.

 I subscribed to the cypherpunks list specificly to see what was going
on with Pegasus / PGP now that David Harris has put his promised hooks
into V. 2.2

 For those who don't know, Pegasus is available for DOS, Windows, and
the MAC.  The windows version (and if history is any guide, shortly the
MAC and DOS version will) has hooks for user definable encryption,
decryption, signing, and signiture verificaiton.

 Distrabution lists, an address book that can include aliases and a
picture can be associated with an alias as well as user defined notes. 
Mail filtering rules.  It's Freeware.
