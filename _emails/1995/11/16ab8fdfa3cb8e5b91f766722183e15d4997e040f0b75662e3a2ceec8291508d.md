|| Actually, the NYT Magazine did a cover story on pot growing within the last
|| year, and toward the end one of the Americans doing grow rooms in Holland
|| said specifically that he was looking toward anonymous electronic
|| communications as a way to control his grow rooms remotely and securely.
|| 

If the story were about how pot growers used locks on their doors to
keep people out, I doubt very many people would care.  The mere fact
that a computer is involved in some way turns on the hype buttons of many
journalists who would otherwise find the story unremarkable.
