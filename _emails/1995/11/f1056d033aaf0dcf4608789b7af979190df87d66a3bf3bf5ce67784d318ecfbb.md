I believe that the thread originally was on pornography in  
general, not any particulary type...

One reason to talk of it might be that users of legitimate pornography
(non-violent erotica, X, whatever you call it) are a likely adopter
of privacy technology (encryption, e cash, anon, etc).

They may also be a sufficiently numerous group to affect elections,
should one or the other party actually be better than the other.

Particularly in Australia, where I understand X-rated material
may be sold only in the Territories, and anyone living in one of
the States has to drive over or mail-order.

One can even imagine situations with real live child pornography...
Should one be forbidden from distributing pictures of oneself
when one was younger?

However, I speak from assumptions and newspaper reports, not
personal experience, so all of the above may be way off :-)
