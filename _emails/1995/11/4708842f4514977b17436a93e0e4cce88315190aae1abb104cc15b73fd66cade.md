It is usually assumed that a foreign person outside the United States
runs no risks if he posts cryptographic software to the net or
otherwise discloses it to other foreign persons, although technically
that is a violation of the United States International Traffic in Arms
Regulations.

I note, however, that in an article entitled ``Export Controls on
Encryption Software'' by Ira S. Rubenstein, dated October 17, 1994 
(which apparently was distributed at some legal conference) the
following passage appears in Section 4(3):

                     ----------------

Finally, foreign employees of those companies or any foreign person
who runs afoul of export controls on technology transfers may face
severe immigration consequencs.[83]  Under the Immigration and
Nationality Act,[84] as revised by the immigration act of 1990,[85] an
alien who seeks entry to the U.S. to engage in activities that violate
or evade export control laws is excludable.[86]  Similarly, an alien
who has engaged, is engaged, or at any time after entry engages in
such activities is deportable.[87]

                           [Notes]

Controls and Immigration Law,'' 93-3 Immigration Briefings (Mar.
1993).
