You could telnet to nyx.cs.du.edu and set up an (optionally pseudonymous)
free account.  I've installed a perl script (posted to this list by George
Magiros) that automagically encrypts a user's incoming email by piping it
through pgp 2.6.2.  To use it, create a .forward file consisting of the line:

"| /nyx/user/bin/privacy <YourPGPKeyID>"

This is far less effective than Sameer's c2 system, but it's simple enough
for net.novices to use.  You can retrieve your encrypted email via telnet,
ftp, or an offline mail reader that has hooks for pgp and works with mail
packets created by uqwk, which is also installed here.
