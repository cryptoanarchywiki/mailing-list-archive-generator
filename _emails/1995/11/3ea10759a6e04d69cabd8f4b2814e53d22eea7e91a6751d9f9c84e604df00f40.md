The anonymity will not protect you very well against libel laws.  The
provider will be suied for libel, and unless they reveal your identity,
they will likely lose in court.  If they cannot reveal the identity,
they will also likely lose the suit.  All the anonymous providers are
doing is giving you anonymity in exchange for their liability.  Even
international anonymity systems are not imune to such threats, as we have
been shown by the Church of whatever.

If it's just a license to slander people, I don't want to support
anonymity.  There are valid reasons for remaining anonymous, but being
able to avoid liability for slander is not one of them.

Slander is in the realm of the courts to decide - at least in the U.S.
