Oh please.

The probable reason that the InterNIC doesn't know about the
132.222.0.0 networks is because they're in Europe. If you search for
either of the network numbers of the IP addresses mentioned above in
the RIPE database <http://www.ripe.net/>, you will find that they
belong to the EUnet backbone.

After pinging 134.222.9.1 successfully, I telnetted to it and it
claimed, quite plausibly, that it's a device (presumably a router) in
Amsterdam. I am currently unable to ping 134.222.35.2; this, however,
fills me with no dread whatsoever.
