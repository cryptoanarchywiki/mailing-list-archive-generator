Mmmm, sometimes we do ... <g>

Sometimes we even think, if I were a lil wa'bbit, where would I go hide

An interesting problem.  

If you are going to take multiple passes, and do top-down and bottom up
analysis, then you can't really parse on the fly. It pretty much has to be
a batch job, I think.  You have to get your data, and then check it.  You
can't simply *trust* that there is not any corruption, and pass all of
your data through. 

And if you're going to parse in a single pass, then we're back to the 
problem of monkeys sitting at typewriters and Shakespeare's sonnets.

Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple.  

The likelyhood of corruption is not based on each past run.  It's just 
like rolling dice.  The odds of rolling boxcars is 1 in 36 (I think) no 
matter how many prior times, you've rolled boxcars.

Twenty passes doesn't influence whether you crap out or not on a single
roll.  Nothing *remembers* past performance to ensure that something
doesn't happen (or happens) many, many times in a row.  I guess, this is
why Atlantic City, Baden Baden, and Las Vegas generally do as well as they
do.
