Sure, why not.  As soon as someone offers something I'd like to get, for 
which they would like the five even more slightly used primes. :-)  But 
seriously, it'll be cool to trade for the book and get something useful 
I'd want anyway...  If not I'll probably chuck it to the public library 
with a post it note that says Anonymous Donation. :-)
