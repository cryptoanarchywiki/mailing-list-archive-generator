Tokens, coupons, gift certificates, etc., are all good examples of
_caching_. As, looked at in a certain way, ordinary folding or jangling
cash is an example of caching. (Yes, quibblers, it is true that we view
folding money as "real money," but really it's a series of claims against
some store of value, formerly gold and silver, and now...?)

Instead of constant interactions with a bank, we place money in "cash
memory" (I mean, "cache memory").

The concerns Hal raises about ecash speed are important. CPU speeds are not
the problem, network speeds are---many home and small business users have
very fast CPUs, able to funtion as Web servers all by themselves, but have
relatively slow network connections.

So, various schemes for reducing the network bottlenecks will be likely.

Tokens are a good example. And as Bill notes, token laundries can make them
_effectively_ untraceable, good enough for many of the low-value
transactions for which they are intended. (As usual, more security means
more computation, more delay, all other things being equal.
