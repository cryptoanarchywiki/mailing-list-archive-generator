We've had this discussion sort of before, but not involving consoles yet, 
so I'll throw in my 2p. 

It isn't likely to be worth doing this with a sony play-station; it's DSP
capabilities are nothing special, and you're paying way too much for
irrelevant stuff like CD-ROMs, 3D accellerators, etc. For the same money
you could get a load of 56Ks or some of the TI chips. If you must
canabalise a game system, you'ld be better off using either a Sega Saturn
(more general purpose CPU power), or mayhaps ripping apart an Atari
Jaguar, which has some nice custom DSP hardware, with a big fat bus to 
play with. It'd still be more of a stupid pet trick than a real solution, 
but definitely a neat hack.

Non-crypto.

BTW, I wouldn't be suprised if we do get to see some sort of Internet 
software for the next generation consoles. I remember getting a pretty 
good spit-take out of some of the NCSA guys at the WWW-WW in 93 when I 
mentioned AT&T were bringing out a modem for the sega genesis, and we 
were thinking about getting a dev kit and taking a shot at 'Sonic the 
Webhog' (turned out to be impractical - bit rate was too low, dev kits 
too expensive). With the new systems, the dynamics have changed (nvram in 
the machines, faster comms, more memory and CPU).

I still think that the idea of selling dickless workstations for the home 
is prehaps not the best response to rapidly falling disk prices; however, 
If you raise the price by $100, and use that money to add a 500Mb/1Gb 
hard drive, the whole thing becomes a lot more interesting - thats enough 
storage to keep your localy created data around (unlikely to exceed 
100Mb), whilst using the rest as a cache for stuff that really lives on 
the network. If I had any shirts worth betting I wouldn't put them on 
this concept, but it might be interesting.
