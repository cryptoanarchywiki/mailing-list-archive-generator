There isn't such a bug in MH, but mhe, if you are using it, won't show
more than that number. Simply split your mailbox and all is well again.

I don't express my general political opinions very much at all. As it
turns out, I'm a very radical libertarian, and anyone reading my stuff
elsewhere would know that, but I don't discuss this stuff in public.

This list *is* political in the sense that it is for people who have
chosen the view that the spread of cryptography is good. It is not,
however, a list for just *any* political discussion. The topic is
purely cryptography, and we operate largely from the viewpoint that if
you think crypto is very evil you probably should discuss that
elsewhere.

I would disagree, but that is a discussion for elsewhere.

A lot of what Tim May has been talking about here for many years is
the inevitability that cryptography will weaken current financial
controls -- sooner or later, whether the central governments want it
to happen or not.

I sent you a detailed explanation, in PRIVATE mail, of why you were
wrong about governments being the only way to provide roads, including
lots of counterexamples to your claim. However, this is not libernet,
this is cypherpunks, and this isn't a place for that discussion. Thats
why I sent you PRIVATE mail.
