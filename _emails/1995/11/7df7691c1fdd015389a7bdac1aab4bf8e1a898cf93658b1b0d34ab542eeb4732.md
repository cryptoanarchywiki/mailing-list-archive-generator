[I'm hoping that we can get some papers on freely redistributable
*crypto* and *security* software -- like PGP or PEM or SSL_eay or
Kerberos or brute-force tools or SATAN or Java tools or whatever!  I'm
on the program committee and am trying to make the conference as broad
as possible, not just focusing on "traditional" free software.  Help!
--gnu]

		CALL FOR PAPERS

	First Conference on Freely Redistributable Software

	Sponsored by the Free Software Foundation

Over the past 15 years, free and low-cost software has become ubiquitous.  
This conference will bring together implementors of several different types

various media).

        Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman

The Conference will be held at the Cambridge Center Marriott, 
2-5 February 1996.  

Papers are invited on any aspect of GNU, Linux, NetBSD, 386BSD, FreeBSD, 
expect, PERL, tcl/tk, and other tools for which the code is accessible 
and redistributable.

Extended abstracts are due on or before Thursday, 30 November 1995. 

Authors will be notified no later than 8 December.
Full papers will be due Thursday, 4 January 1996.

Program committee:
        Peter H. Salus, chair
