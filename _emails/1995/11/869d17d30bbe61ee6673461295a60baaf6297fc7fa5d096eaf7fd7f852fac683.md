The same sort of things could be said of the telephone compared with
written correspondence. Why would anyone have one in their business or
home? Anyone can overhear a conversation, people will just chat, the only
thing you can do with it is talk, there is no record of the correspondence,
why would anyone want to talk to people on the other side of town? etc.

Think telephone, not computer. Think people over 40 who want a
communication tool with zero maintenance and zero learning curve.
