i have some nude pics i took of myself when i was twelve.
i don't *feel* victimized.  maybe i was victimized but 
didn't know it?

gandalf.

PS.  is it a crime for me to keep these pics?
if the cops find them in my locker, will i get busted?
what happens if i give them to someone? is that a crime?
