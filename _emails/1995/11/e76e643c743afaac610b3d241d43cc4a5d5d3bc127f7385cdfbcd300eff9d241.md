i understand the non-random portions of the pgp output, which is why i
specified in my origional message that the 1st 20 or so lines would find
their way to the bit bucket.

i'm confused here. how would the 'key' to the otp be related to my pgp
encryption key? if i strip off all the identifying information that pgp
uses to recognise how to decrypt a message, and destroy the 'clean' copy of
the file(s) that eventually became part of my otp, how could the resulting
output be tied to my key? if it could, then pgp is less secure than i give
it credit for being.

if your objection is based on the fact that my public key is a known entity,
, this can easily be bypassed by creating a brand new key from a freshly
unzipped copy of pgp. use that key to create the otp, then destroying the
key(s) used to create it.

isn't this essentially what i'm doing? if it is necessary, i can do
this...(assuming a virgin key)
1. create a cyphertext of a file.
2. strip the indentifying lines.
3. create a new cyphertext from the resulting file. 
4. repeat until paranoia level < comfort zone.

my point here is that _if_ pgp output is random enough, i wouldn't need
hardware. even i, with my extremely limited programming skills could create
a .cmd file or program that could be used as imput for a stream cypher.

imo, for crypto to be useful, it has to be easy. i'm trying to find a way
to do this that can be implemented anywhere.
