Yes, I had such a lawsuit.  No, it didn't go anywhere in the courts,
but the feds did eventually cave in to the principal demand of my
suit: That the DSA patent be made available to anyone on a royalty-free
basis.

So how is it that RSADSI and Cylink/CKC claim you need licenses to
their patents to use DSS?  Because they have other patents.  I have
another lawsuit directed at those patents.  Stay tuned.
