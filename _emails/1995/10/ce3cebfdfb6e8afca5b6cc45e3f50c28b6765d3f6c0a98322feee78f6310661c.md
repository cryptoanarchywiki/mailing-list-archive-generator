   "High Stakes, High Tech. Imagine the Internet As Electronic
   Casino."

      Mr. Fields is the former director of Darpa. He now hopes
      to transform the Internet, developed to defeat the
      evil empire, into a powerful medium for indulging
      America's growing weakness for wagering, to bring
      casinos to the people -- and into the center of American
      life, the home.

      "When I was looking around for what I would do next I
      decided to do something in the entertainment and gaming
      industries because they're now the greatest users of
      advanced technologies," Mr. Fields said. "It used to be
      the defense industry."
