Can we please talk to Dr. Fred, the Poster Child of the Informal Fallacy,
if we *really* have to, off line?

I had my fill of specious arguments in college already. Speaking of both, I
would reccommed any book on elementary logic (Copi used to be a good one),
specifically the informal falacies section, if you want a good laugh, and
to see why his "Did so, did not! Prove it didn't!" argument style makes me
want to step outside and hork in the bushes.

I would hate to kill-file people who are normally clueful, but I will, just
to get this second-order Fredness out of my face.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
