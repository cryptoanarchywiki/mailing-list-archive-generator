The idea here is to use multiple alternative channels for distributing
the checksums (newsgroups, mailing lists, telephone support lines,
fax-back service, e-mail, etc.), in addition to the ftp sites.

Also, since you guys use (relatively untrusted) mirror sites, you can
distribute the checksums on your official sites, so that people can
verify them from you directly, even if it's more practical for their
main download to be from a "local" mirror.
