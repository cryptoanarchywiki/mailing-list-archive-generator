I posted it on Cypherpunks becuase it is the only list I take where such
political views are even mentioned.  I thought that people on the list would
enjoy it.  I prefaced it with [noise[] so that people who would object would
skip over it.  Evidently that disclaimer is not enough anymore.

I am not certain as to the "nose levels" as I thought they stopped
publishing a number of months back.

I think you need to get some treatment for those hardening of the orthodixies.
