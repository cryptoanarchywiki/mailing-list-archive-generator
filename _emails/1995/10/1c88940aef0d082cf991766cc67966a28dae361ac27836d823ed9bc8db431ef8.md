Look just replace "cancel" with "mark as worthless and sign".  Then 
each reader may choose to "honor" the "cancel" or not.  If you are 
reading clari.news.world then you completely "honor" cancels signed by 
ClariNet.  If you are reading alt.religion.scientology, then you have 
your user agent specifically bring "cancelled" articles to your 
attention for reading.  :-)


(As an aside this serves for moderation as well.  Just tell your
user agent to honor messages marked as "cancelled, signed Bob The 
Moderator" and you have entered a moderated newsgroup.  And the 
protocol that's gonna bring it to you?  NoCeM and its relatives.  Real 
Soon Now, I think.)
