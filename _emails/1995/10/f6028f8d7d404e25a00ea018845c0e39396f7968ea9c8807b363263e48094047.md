Actually, it is not jeapordy that they get from doing so, but some of the 
best bug finders and security experts on the planet.. for close to free.
If hackers can find 10 bugs before final release, it means there is a 
good chance that they will fix those bugs before final release.

Think of it this way.. you practice a new task until you are competent at 
it.. beta code is the same.. it is the practice or scratch code that may 
be refined into the final product.

Thanks-
