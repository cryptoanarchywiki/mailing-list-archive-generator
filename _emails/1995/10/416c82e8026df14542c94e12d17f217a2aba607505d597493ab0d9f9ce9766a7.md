Welcome to the club, guy... 

I found this drivel in my mailbox this morning too.

Here's the headers from mine, if anybody thinks it will help track these morons.

Looks to me like it originally gated into the mail-system at
mercury.sfsu.edu, wherever that is. From who is beyond my understanding.
Hopefully somebody can find out and let the apropriate people know so it
can be stopped from happening again.

I get enough junk in my paper mailbox without having to wade through it in
my email box!
