Even nicer would be if the Windows beta included *all* the files needed. The
setup routine wants to install some OLE2 .dll's, but they don't seem to be
included with the compressed file, or even on the Netscape site. I was able
to work around it, since I already had the OLE2 stuff on my machine, and
edited the installation scripts and such - other folks aren't likely to be
as 'lucky'.

I suspect that Netscape is going to be hearing about that little oversight.....
