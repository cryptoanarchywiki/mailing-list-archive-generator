I used to have this C source that I could embed in a program, and it
would tell me if the software had been tampered with at runtime.  I've
lost/mislaid/whatever the source, and I was wondering if anyone had anything
that would do the same thing.  As I recall, it calculated a simple CRC and
embedded it into the .EXE file (it was written for MS-DOS).

It doesn't need to be cryptographically secure - I just need to check to see
if the executable has been corrupted.  I've leafed through alt.sources and
comp.sources.*.

Thanks in advance...

"Past the wounds of childhood, past the fallen dreams and the broken families,
through the hurt and the loss and the agony only the night ever hears, is a
waiting soul.  Patient, permanent, abundant, it opens its infinite heart and
asks only one thing of you ... 'Remember who it is you really are.'"
