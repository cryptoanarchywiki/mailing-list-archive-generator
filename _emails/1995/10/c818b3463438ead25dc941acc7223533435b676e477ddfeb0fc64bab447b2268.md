I doubt anyone would disagree.

The fuzzy line dividing exportable goods from non-exportable goods
will have gotten slightly clearer.  I admit it isn't all that novel
or intresting, or even in this case _useful_ result.  Esp since
the PGP book appears to be exportable.

However I think it is a good idea to slowly approch the dividing
line between exportable and non-exportable.  Wouldn't it be nice
to be able to hold up the shirt and say "this is exportable", and
then scan it & save it onto a floppy and then say "this is not"
(assuming that a floppy of the shirt is denyed CJ) when arguing
with someone about how arbatary the export laws are?

(Also we may find a better quality shirt printer and actually be
able to print readably not only CODE128 barcodes, but some of the
more advanced encoding methods that store as much as 40K a page...
how big is the PGP source?)

Not much.

That would be much better.  More free publicity.  An example of how
impossabble it is to enforce the ITAR that anyone should be able to
understand.


Of corse in either case having the CJR steps posted *is* actually
valuable to anyone who hopes to take a shareware (or comercial, or
totally free) product through the same process (as opposed to 
anonumously posting it & not getting payed).

Yes if distribution over the networks were allowed nobody would care
about the shirt.  Of corse.

I susspect the help the shirts will provide will be minimial.  They
may help cypherpunks & cyphergroupies spot each other on the street,
but that is of limited value.  They may help spread the word about
how foolish the ITAR is, and that is their only real value (well
aside from entertainment).

(and yeah it is a shame the shirt actually says "has been classified",
I had thought I said "qualifyes as a" which would have been correct -
but that may just be my revisionest memory kicking in)
