I'm well advanced with a Windows Pre-Mailer for use with Nymservers. The 
project was inspired by a very serious emotional support group I'm in. 
It's LISTSERV based and doesn't mix well with anon.penet.fi. Nymservers 
would be excellent for such purposes if they were easy to use. Hence this 
project.

I certainly don't want to create a Spammers tool. Right mow, I have put in 
space for managing up to 10 Nyms. I chose 10 because I thought it was more 
than anyone would want....
