I have setup an un-moderated digest of the Cypherpunks mailing list and it
is now available for everyone..

My main goal on Cypherpunks is to lurk and the digest version lets me do
that without being forced to read each one as it comes in.. [or filter 
the posts into a mailbox that I have a bad tendancy to leave for long 
periods of time...]

Digests will be created every 40K bytes.

subscribe by sending e-mail to majordomo@gateway.com with a BODY line:

		subscribe cypherpunks-d

Enjoy..
