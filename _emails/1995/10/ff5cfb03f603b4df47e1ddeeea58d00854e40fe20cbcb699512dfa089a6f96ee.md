I'm confused here.  How will it be obvious?  Unless you mean that you're
going to sit there and watch it while it goes through the, (on average),
999999999/2 keys it would have to try before finding it.  That could
take awhile and really slow things down if it took user intervention
for each test.  You can't beat the human eye on visual discrimination
though.
