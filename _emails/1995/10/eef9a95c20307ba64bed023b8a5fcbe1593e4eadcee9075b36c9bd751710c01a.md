There could be a risk based messgae market here.  That is what the Futures 
market is about speculation and hedging (buging and selling risk). What is
a risky message in one country may be acceptable in another.

I like the Mail Delerery Service idea combined with user selectable
filters.

I would also like to see the merging of different message transmission
technology using gateways.  We have gateways... Fidonet to/from internet,
email to newsgroup, and Telegram to (snail) mail.  Would it not be
beneficial to add other gateways such as email to snail mail, email
to fax, fax to email, snail mail to email, and CB to email.

Remailers are in place in the RF world.  They are called repeaters or
transponders.  They perform the function of taking a weak signal and
boost it's power so that a larger group of receivers can pick up the
signal.  Ham radio has (vhf ?) repeaters in metropolitan areas.  Satellites
use transponders allowing the signal to be sent from horizon to horizon.
(this already has potential problems.  Hughes is comming out with a
product called DirectPC. I believe it allows you would transmit over a slow
modem but receive high data rates from a satellite.  I guess if you just look
at or edit some crypto source code from your shell account, it would be exported
as far as the satellite horizon as a byproduct of being sent to your display).

Does it not make sense for some kind of listening post to be set up to
take messages sent via Satellite, Ham radio, or CB and either place them
in a newsgroup or an archive site or a mail delivery service?  Transmitting
your anonymous e-mail by CB would be kind of nice.

Some of these RF modes are highly regulated. I believe that Hams
already have packet radio but cannot encrypt data and are accountable
for all the data being sent on their transmitter.  CB seems less regulated
, perhaps because of it's limited power and range. (this would change
with an internet repeater.)

I don't know about satellite regulation, but recall some CNN broadcast out
of Bagdad with a portable transmitter during Desert Storm.  Perhaps that kind
of equipment will be cheap and available in the future.  Is public access
limited to cable?
