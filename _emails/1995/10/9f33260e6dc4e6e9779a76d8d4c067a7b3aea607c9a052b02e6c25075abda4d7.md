Marcus agreed with a position founded on the work in the late 70s and
early 80s by many researchers on proving the security of operating
systems under the Bell-Lapadula model.  The main result I recall is that
a Cray-1 took 24 hours to prove the Simple Security Property about a
100-line limited-Pascal program used as the core of (I think it was)
UCLA-secure Unix.  Complexity goes up quickly with program size, and this
property is only one of many you might like to prove.

Let's go - I will provide the distribution mechanisms, and I think I
know someone who is interested in the theorem proof side.  I know of
several experts on theorum proving who may well pitch in.  What program
do you want to prove secure next (we're currently finishing up my secure
Web server).

The core dumping shows that Java can ALSO write files into the file
system, something it was claimed to NEVER be able to do! If you could
get the right name for the core file, and set up the first few bytes
right, ...

Why not start much simpler.  Write a Java program to disrupt services by
flooding the local network with garbage packets - or with some sort of
request it lets you write. How about a Java program that launches SATAN
probes against all reachable hosts?
