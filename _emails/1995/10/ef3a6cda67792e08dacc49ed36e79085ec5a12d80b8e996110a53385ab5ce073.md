I am not technically competent to judge if his/her claim is worth
reposting, but here it is, clipped from the very long Friday 13
rant, as found at Raph's index site (Subject: Bugs Bounty??...shhh...
I'm huntin wa'bits... From:anonymous-remailer@shell.portal.com).

<long first part deleted; general aspects on the Bounty Hunt>

And this is where we introduce a little old document called pushpull.html.
from Netscape's Web site. It's titled: An Exploration of Dynamic
Documents.

And I can think of many people who would _also_ like to push down data
to a browser. But, that's not a great idea. Guess what?? It's not even 
a good idea. It might even be a bad idea.

Yes, the client "processes data" and then possibly displays it, while in

Hmm. Netscape's clients blindly trust and follows server's instructions
and does what it is told to do. If it's told to load a particular
document in five seconds. It does that. It dances to the server's
instructions. Something which should cause any Security Administrator's
hair to stand on end, as the server takes control of the client's machine 
and "manipulates it".

And this is the problem. We have a pipe. And we have a server making a
decision when it will send the next data block. I guess the server could
also decide dynamically what that data block is going to be once it has
opened it's pipe to the client. 

That is way too much trust for a client to place in a server that it 
doesn't know if it can trust.

Yep, the appropriate window just "updates" itself at the command of 
the server. A good faith update ... or let's call it a good faith 
process.

Let's emphasize that what we have is a slave client at one end of a pipe
accepting an object-specific content-type from any server. 

This is not within the tradition of multipart/mixed. 

And this is a problem.

Now let's play with the prior example. Let's say that we utilized
different types of objects. I'll use multipart/parallel and
application/postscript. 

>>Content-type: multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=ThisRandomString

>>--ThisRandomString

>>Content-type: application/postscript
>>
>>Deletefile
>>Renamefile
>>Filenameforall
>>File
>>
>>--ThisSecondRandomString--
>>
>>--ThisRandomString--

I think that the foregoing explains itself without me having to draw any
more maps, than is absolutely necessary. The first data object sent is
application/postscript. The second object is multipart/parallel. 

And it's where we conflict with federal requirements:

> b. Unauthorized manipulation of the computer and its associated
> peripheral devices."[8, sec. I B.3]

And I think that this is applicable across the entire product line.

I wonder if this makes me eligible for a bounty for each product where 
there is this Security Bug?? That would be very chivalrous of Netscape
to offer me that. Then maybe I could get a real computer rather than 
this crufty old Mac Plus (a yellow one) and my 2400 baud modem... and 
then, I might just be able to do some virtually real hunting.

Alice de 'nonymous ... (doing a bad impression of Elmer Fudd with 
thoughts of Bugs Bounty in his lil mind.)

...just another one of those...

P.S. And yes I brought this whole issue (tangentially) to the 
attention of netscape.com yesterday afternoon. I think I asked 
whether they were going to have a formal specification and register
their x-mixed-replace with IANA. They haven't gotten to my email
yet, (I think). Or maybe, I'm in the Bulk response group. <shrug>

P.P.S. I give permission to have this propogate freely through 
the cyber-aethyr. All other rights are of course reserved.
