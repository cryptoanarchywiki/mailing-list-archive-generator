They could also end up getting dumped in a message pool. Perhaps all (or most)
nym servers could operate mailing list message pools. Anyone could
subscribe to the pool, and any nym could have its mail directed to that
pool. It should not be too difficult to rig a procmail script to try to
decrypt all mail from that list, and deliver those that could be decrypted.
