I for one am interested. Perhaps you could put it up on your web pages ?

This is an interesting point I hadn't previously considered. Can anyone
comment on the state of the art in fast approximate character recognition ?
I expect that the people working on recognition of text in TV pictures etc.
would have a good idea. 

My lay computer scientist's guess is that it wouldn't be all that difficult to
pick a small sample window a couple of characters wide, and decide if the
contents were a couple of characters. Then you'd worry about testing for
higher-level linguistic intelligibility as a second cut. But I don't
really know.

A known-plaintext attack on the system would ideally include knowledge of the
typefaces, fonts etc. typically used to print documents at the source....

ObTheoretician:
Um, exponentially in terms of what ?  It sounds like this multiplies the
expected brute force cracking time by a constant, but doesn't change the
big-O time of the algorithm. I agree, however, that big constants can be
rather significant when it comes to real world applications.
