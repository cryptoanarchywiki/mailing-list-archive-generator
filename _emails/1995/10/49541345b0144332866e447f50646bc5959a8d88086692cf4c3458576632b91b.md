The spew through the proprietary dike on this is
swelling: MasterCard's consortium yesterday and the
NetManage/Cylink today both emphasize public availability
of specs in counter-response to the flaws helpfully
discovered in Netscape by the ever public spirited
cypherpunks.

Whether any of these vaunted "superior" systems respond
to attacks as constructively as Netscape will be the
challenge.

BTW, has anyone reviewed the promised MasterCard specs
supposedly released on Tuesday?
