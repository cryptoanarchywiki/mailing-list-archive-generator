Version 0.92 21st Sept 1995.

Something I didn't mention earlier; we felt that letting the unwashed
masses read /dev/*random was not a good idea, as they could deplete
the pool of entropy all to easily for attack purposes. For the same
(or similar) reason, giving the said unwashed masses _write_ privelige
might allow them to set /dev/*random to a known state. You've probably
already thought of this, but I just had to say it :-).

(Hmm.. Thinks of ways of doing something similar. I'm not functioning too
well right now.)

Are you sure about this? The stochastisity if this would be pretty
hefty. Not only would our attacker have to get the _time_ that the
interrupt occurred (if it interrupted our machine), he would then have
to process in brute-force mode all possible times in his error range.
What is more, more interrupts are coming in...

Hokay! Please also send me _your_ latest. (BTW - did Linus put it in
his latest kernel?)
