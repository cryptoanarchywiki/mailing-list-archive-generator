Then you should support his point which is valid.

Being insulting and calling people names benefits nobody.

I strongly disagree.  If Netscape provided a way to execute shell
commands on your host from a remote computer, it would certainly be a
hole created by their product.  The fact that the default shell is
potentially dangerous means it's incumbant on those who provide access
to it to provide adequate protection.

If Netscape wants to claim their product doesn't degrade security, they
should provide a safe postscript interpreter or not provide hooks to
unsafe ones.
