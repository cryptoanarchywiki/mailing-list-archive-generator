Actually, "Failure to Identify" is a misdemeanor in most municipalities nationwide.
It is definitely so here in Indiana, and in most places I've been to. The only thing
surprising is that YOU were not aware of this! :-) The point being the Cops always
want to know who they're fuc... er, dealing with. The first thing they'll do is radio
in who they're accous... er, stopping. The reason for this is, should they get their
just desserts... I mean come to some harm, the rest of their gang... I mean, 
brother officers will know who to come after! :-)
