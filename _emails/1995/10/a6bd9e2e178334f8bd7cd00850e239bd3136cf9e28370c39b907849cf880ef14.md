From what I heard last week, the remailer operator's account at
c2.org expired and was cancelled, thus the remailer is down.
Previously, it had been a full-fledged cypherpunk-type remailer,
with Type II (Mixmaster) capabilities, to boot.

Such are the uncertainties of using remailers.  What would have been
nice, of course, would have been for Sameer (sameer@c2.org), or
whoever runs Community Conexxion, to post a bulletin here giving
everyone a few days' notice before pulling the plug on this
remailer.  Undoubtedly, people are still chaining through it and
wondering why their messages/posts are not showing up.

NOTE:  People with anon reply blocks from alpha.c2.org that chained
through robo need to replace them, or risk lost messages!
