Dear Friends,

With a record number of 35 speakers and panelists (whew!), the program for the 
3rd Annual Bionomics Conference has been finalized.  Since our brochures were 
printed, we've added a number of interesting and thought-provoking individuals, 
including

o Lew Perelman, author of "Hyperlearning"
o Andrew Basile, author of "The SPA's Guide to Online Law"
o Morley Winograd, author of "Taking Control:  Politics in the Information Age"
o Frank Gregorsky, former chief of staff to Cong. Newt Gingrich
o Jim Griffin, Director of Technology at Geffen Records
o Don Lavoie, Director, Program on Social & Organizational Learning, George 
Mason University
o Irwin Glenn, Senior Systems Engineer, Netscape Communications
o Pat McKim, Managing Partner, Practical Strategies 
o Cindy Cooke, Director, Democratic Leadership Council of CA
o Dennis Miller, Associate Professor, Baldwin-Wallace College
. . .
What's more, for the truly tech-savvy, you can now pay for your conference 
attendance with Cybercash.  Just check our web site (www.bionomics.org).
. . .           ^^^^^^^^^
