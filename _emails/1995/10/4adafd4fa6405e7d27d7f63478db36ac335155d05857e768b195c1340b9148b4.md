(A copy of this message has also been posted to the following newsgroups:

Could somebody please tell me who illegally canceled my article
<llurch-1510951157410001@tip-mp3-ncs-3.stanford.edu>, referenced
in the followup article below, as well as several other articles
I posted this morning? It was cross-posted to several groups, but
I don't think it should have triggered any spam-cancelers, and
I see nothing in news.admin.net-abuse.misc. I'd find the cuplrit
myself, but Stanford only saves the last 100 or so messages in
control. See the rather prominent blinking link on the Web page
below for the other PGP-signed article that was canceled.

Thanks in advance. Followups set to news.admin.net-abuse.misc.

Don't bother canceling this article, my friend. By the way, the
other articles were saved and emailed as well.

I will be charitable and assume that it was someone else I've pissed off
(lord knows there's several), and not someone working directly for
Microsoft or the Church [spit] of Scientology, who were both maligned in
the canceled posts.
