	This is the goal, but one must make sure that one's work does
not work -against- one's goal. My original draft for the hack digicash
web page was rather inflammatory "hasn't netscape taught us anything?"
but upon consultation I decided to change it to be less inflammatory
and mention that digicash, in principle, is the best electronic
payment system on the net, and that we need to make sure it is the
best payment system -in practice-.
