Check out SMART, which was originally developed by Gerard Salton at
Cornell. (He is one of the pioneers of IR.) The current release is
maintained by Chris Buckley (chrisb@balder.chrisb.com). Check out:

ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/smart

If you don't feel like installing the whole thing but are interested
in testing it out on some spam, then I could run some tests for you.

Here are some literary references for SMART:
