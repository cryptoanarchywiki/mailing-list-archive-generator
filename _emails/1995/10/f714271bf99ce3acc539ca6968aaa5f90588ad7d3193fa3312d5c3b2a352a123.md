Even if you assume complete independence of key setup, if a successful
decryption at each layer can be independently detected and verified
(which seems likely in your example), there're only about 3 * (2 ^ 40)
total operations in the worst case, NOT 2 ^ (3 * 40) operations needed
to expose the plaintext.  This is an effective 41.5 bits, not 120.
