Thanks for responding, Black (if I may call you Black), it means I don't 
have to.

Also an incentive for jurisdictions to engage in a beneficial "Dutch 
Auction" in which they offer lower and lower tax rates to attract 
employers and employees.

And as the intellectual components of goods and services are increasingly 
unbundled from the physical for efficiency reasons (greater range of 
competitors made possible) more work can be done at a distance.

Fairly easy these days with drop shipping of goods by third parties and 
the bypassing of retail distribution chains for more and more goods.

In any case, if goods end up being a smaller portion of Gross World 
Product, taxes on them become less significant.  The existence of 
taxation of physical goods certainly tips things in favor of the untaxed 
non physical goods and services.

Note that agriculture once made up 95% or more of GWP.  It doesn't any 
more.  Non physical goods like entertainment, financial services, etc can 
grow to dominate the world economy because they adapt well to cheap 
distribution over the nets.

In the Progress and Freedom Foundation's Friction Free Capitalism, taxes 
are a big part of the "friction" that is disintermediated.
