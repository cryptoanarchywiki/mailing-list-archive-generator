A simple entropy measuring algorithm:

Generate N random pointers into a file. (or extract N random short 
strings from the file)

Sort them into order of the strings,

Find the number of bits in common between one string and the 
next string.  Total up S, the number of bits in common

Calculate (N * lg N)/S

For an encrypted file, this quantity should be close to unity, because 
the order in an encrypted file should not be easily detectable.
