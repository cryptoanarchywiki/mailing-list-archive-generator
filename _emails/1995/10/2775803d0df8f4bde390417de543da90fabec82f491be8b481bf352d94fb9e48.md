I think the idea of a token has come up before. I think it is a good idea.
The token should have some expiration information in it so the remailer
need not keep it around forever (or it could just "forget" all token older
than 3 months). Right now there is not much spare room in the Mixmaster
headers.

There are several ideas for improvements in Mixmaster that will require the
adoption of an incompatible message format. I plan to collect them and
implement them all at once. One of the ideas is an expiration date in the
message to keep it from ever being replayed (even after the remailer
expires its record of the message ID).
