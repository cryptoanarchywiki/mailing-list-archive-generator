There is an attack here, but the text doesn't go into detail about it.
You have to assume that (as with the current ecash implementation from
Digicash) people have non-anonymous accounts with the bank.  If Alice
wants to know Bob's identity she can collude with the bank to find
out.  As Tim describes, she gives Bob some money, then quickly deposits
the coins herself.  In effect, she intentionally double-spends (with
the bank's permission).  When Bob makes his deposit, his coins are
recognized as matching those which Alice double-spent.  So if Alice
was, say, an agent involved in a government "sting", and bought bootleg
software from Bob, his identity can in fact be learned when he deposits
the money.

Actually with the DigiCash system and in fact all of the ecash systems I
know about, you don't have to get so fancy; Alice can simply give the
bank a record of her transaction with Bob (the coins she sent him) and
these will be recognized when Bob deposits them.

Lucky Green has been discussing ways in which people could exchange coins
anonymously even with DigiCash's ecash in order to provide some immunity
from such attacks.
