Ah, a very astute comment!

Indeed, my chief concern--speaking for myself--is not hiding my activities
from my neighbors, who, by the way, share my distaste for high taxes, big
government, etc., but in ensuring that the various enforcement agencies are
not aware of my activities.

(And even then, my concern is a bit abstract, as I'm not--take my word--a
pot grower, a money launderer, an arms dealer, or a terrorist. I have
violated some laws about obtaining necessary permits, such as the ones
needed to run a computer consulting firm in one's home, but I don't fear a
pre-dawn raid by the jack-booted thugs over this.)

Priuacy is mostly needed to protect against the government, or those who
inform to the government, because it is manifestly the government that
throws people in jail for doing "illegal" things, not one's neighbors.
