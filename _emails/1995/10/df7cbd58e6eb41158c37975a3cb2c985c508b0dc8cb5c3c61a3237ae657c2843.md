It's OK, when these guys were spamming Usenet a few weeks ago with their 
product announcement (admittedly, they did at least keep it to comp 
groups) they said it was export-approved. Therefore, it can be pretty 
much written off from a security standpoint - it's at best as good as 
40-bit RC4, and I sure wouldn't use that for secure communications.

I'd still like to know how it works so we can see just how insecure it 
is, though.
