Thanks to all of you who have responded to my announcement of the FidoNet
remailer.  I appreciate the good words.  So far, the remailer has handled
everything that you have thrown at it.  One remailed message bounced back
to me because the FidoNet/internet gateway system could not find the
addressed system.  That one looks like a gateway problem.

Please keep sending messages through it.  Send grunged messages, improperly
addressed messages -- anything you can think of to make it barf.  I want it
to be able to withstand the vicious attacks that I'm sure will come once
the control phreaks in Fido find it exists.

I will be gone the next two weeks, so the system may go down.  Don't expect
any response from me until then, either.   I will answer any mail when I
return.  In the meantime, I'm off tomorrow morning to enjoy Vincent
Cate's hospitality at the Anguilla cypherpunks meet.
