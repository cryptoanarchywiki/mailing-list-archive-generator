This is where the difference between your view and mine seem to part company.
I am not talking about some bug in postscript or the shell.  I am talking about
a program that grants remote access to run these programs in the normal manner,
which is unsafe.

To support the position you seem to be taking (and the one currently
taken by Netscape), you would have to say that the last several Sendmail
"bugs" were not sendmail problems but rather shell problems because all
sendmail did was allow you to execute a shell from the remote machine
(perhaps via a queue file).  You would also apparently say that it's
secure to allow a server to grant unlimited shell access to unknown,
unauthenticated remote users.  This seems foolhearty to me.

That's correct.  Secure software has to have secure distribution in
order to maintain its security when distributed through an untrusted
channel.  I think that Netscape uses an MD5 checksum which the members
of this list seem to place unlimited trust in (incorrectly in my view,
but that would be picking two nits with one keyboard entry).

That's not true.  Certain things in their .mailcap file can create
holes, but not just anything.  One of the standard things we do in
external audits is look for files such as this and examine their
contents to see if unsafe configurations are in use.
