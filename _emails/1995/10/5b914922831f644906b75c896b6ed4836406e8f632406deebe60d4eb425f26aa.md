Well, the Welcome message says this:

->If you ever want to remove yourself from this mailing list,
->you can send mail to "Majordomo@toad.com" with the following command
->in the body of your email message:
->
->    unsubscribe cypherpunks cypherpunks@toad.com

So it is but a small leap of logic to remove the 'un' in order to
subscribe, since to my knowlege the Welcome message does not tell you how
to subscribe. A human interface problem?
