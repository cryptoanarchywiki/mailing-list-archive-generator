Recently Peter Trei <trei@process.com> called for new names and slogans to
replace the negatively loaded name "Cypherpunks." Here is one effort
(partially based on his suggestion, but with refinements.) Note that I
intend the term "strong privacy" to include both cryptography-based tools,
and other tools such as remailers. I hereby place the following into the
public domain.

* * *

I lock my car.
I secure my house.
I send my letters in envelopes.
I store my valuables in safe places.
I don't let strangers hold my wallet.
I don't wear a name tag everywhere I go.
I carry my cash and credit cards out of sight.
I don't show off my key number when visiting the ATM.

I protect my e-mail and files with strong privacy tools.

Don't you?
