Good point.  To guard against this, Alice needs to double blind what she
sends to the bank.  She can then remove one layer of blinding and show
the results to Bob.  Of course Bob and the bank can still colude because
of the timing of the transactions.  This seems to be a fundamental
weakness of this reverse e-cash scheme.
