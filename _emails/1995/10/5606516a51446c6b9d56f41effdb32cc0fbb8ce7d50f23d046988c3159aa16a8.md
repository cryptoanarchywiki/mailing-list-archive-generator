I am currently working for a company that has a graphic encryption 
product called PrivaSoft. I was wondering if there were other products 
or engines that also provide graphic encryption. (graphic encryption is 
the use of a encryption algorythm to scramble an image taken of a 
document.) 
 
Also if any of ya'll are famillar with graphic encryption, I am looking 
for opinions as to its strengths / weaknesses.
