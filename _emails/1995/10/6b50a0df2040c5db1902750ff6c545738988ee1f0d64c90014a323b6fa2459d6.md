No, the drawback is that then all the readers of the newsgroup would
complain that this remailer was cluttering up the newsgroup with
unreadable garbage.  Twice.

Here's another modest proposal.  I note that once you've sent a message,
there appears to be no way for a recipient to reply without knowing who
the originator is.  A simple addition to the remailer protocol would be
to encrypt the message and the control information seperately.  This
would allow the sender of a message to provide a pre-packaged method for
returning a reply.  The recipient of the original message could then
just blindly send his reply to the starting point remailer specified in
the original message by tacking the pre-packaged routing information on
to the front of his message.
