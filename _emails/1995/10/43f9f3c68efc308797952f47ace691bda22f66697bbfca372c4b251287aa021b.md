                            CRYPTO '96

         August 18-22, 1996, Santa Barbara, California, USA

                          CALL FOR PAPERS


General Information:

Crypto '96, the Sixteenth Annual Crypto Conference, is organized by the
International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), in
cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on
Security and Privacy, and the Computer Science Department of the
University of California, Santa Barbara.  Original papers are solicited
on all technical aspects of cryptology.

Instructions for Authors:

Please send a cover letter, one title page and 16 copies of an extended
abstract.  They must be received by the Program Chair at the address
given below no later than February 14, 1996 (or postmarked by February
4, 1996 and sent via airmail).

The cover letter must state: "This paper does not substantially
duplicate work that any of the authors have published elsewhere or have
submitted in parallel to any other conference or workshop that has
proceedings."

The title page should contain the title, the names of the authors, their
postal and e-mail addresses and the short abstract; it should be made
clear who is the author to whom correspondence should be sent.  The
first page of the extended abstract should be an informal one-page
statement (that will not be published in the Proceedings) describing the
content of the oral presentation that will be given at Crypto '96 in the
event the paper is accepted (this statement is expected to be different
from the short abstract of the paper).  This page and the extended
abstract must be ANONYMOUS, i.e., they must contain no indication
whatsoever of the identity of the author(s).  The main body of the
extended abstract should start with the title, short abstract, and list
of keywords.  This should be followed by a succinct statement
appropriate for a non-specialist reader specifying the subject
addressed, its background, the main achievements, and their significance
to cryptology.  Technical details directed to the specialist should then
follow.

Submissions are limited to 10 single-spaced pages of 11pt type, not
counting the bibliography and clearly marked appendices.  Since referees
are not required to read the appendices, the paper should be
intelligible without them.  The paper including bibliography and
appendices must run to no more than 15 pages.  These limits will be
strictly enforced.

Unfortunately, because of the burdens on the Program Committee and
the need to keep strictly to the time schedule, we will have to
summarily reject any submission not in keeping with the above
instructions.

Authors are encouraged to make 2-sided copies if possible.  Please send
submissions by post; unfortunately, we cannot accept submissions by
e-mail or fax.

Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent to authors on
April 22, 1996.

Conference Proceedings:

Proceedings will be available at the meeting.  They will be published in
the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science.  Clear
instructions about the final copy will be sent to authors of accepted
papers.  The final copies of the accepted papers will be due on June 1,
1996.  Final papers arriving too late will be removed from the main
program.  Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper
will be presented at the conference.

Stipends:

A limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain
funding to attend the conference.  Students whose papers are accepted
and who will present the paper themselves are encouraged to apply if
such assistance is needed.  Requests for stipends should be addressed to
the general chair.
