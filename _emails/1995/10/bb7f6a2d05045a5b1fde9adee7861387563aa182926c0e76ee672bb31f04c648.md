PGP 2.6.2 is not going to be re-released.  I have been working on a
PGP 2.6.3 release, but I must admit that I haven't had as much time as
I would like to work on it.

Before 2.6.3 is released, all of the reported bugs (which are
currently archived and marked as fixed when the bug is fixed) will be
hand-checked.  Unfortunately I just have not had the time to work on
this, due to other obligations.  Hopefully I will have more time this
winter.
