Thanks to sameer, David and Joel M. for pidaho, it was working all the 
time. Those messages I was getting were the confimations. I just didn't 
know it. After decrypting the messages everything is working fine now. 
The only thing I didn't see in the Help files was that when you get 
confirmation from Alpha, it will be encrypted. But that was pointed out 
in Pidaho, Ver 2.5 Beta 6. 

Again thanks to all that helped.
