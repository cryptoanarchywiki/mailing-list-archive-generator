   Without actually agreeing with the FAA, the reason you can't have a name
   other than your own on your ticket, as well as why you are required to
   be in your assigned seat on take-off and landing is because if there is 
   a plane crash, they need to be able to identify an otherwise difficult
   to identify body. This does have some relevance to airport security if
   a plane is blown up.

                                 Sorry about this,
                                      Bob
