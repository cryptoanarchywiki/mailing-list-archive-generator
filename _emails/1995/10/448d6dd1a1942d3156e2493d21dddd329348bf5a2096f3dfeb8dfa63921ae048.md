Conference Background
---------------------
WebNet is the annual conference of the Web Society that was founded in 1995
out of a concern that an organisation addressing the application aspects of
the Web and representing a lobby for Web users independent of specific
platforms and without the domination of commercial organisations was needed.
The WebSociety complements existing other bodies such as the Internet
Society and W3C. The former is, by definition, more concerned with
providing global Internet services than anything else and the latter is
specifically oriented towards one particular system WWW. The Web Society
and hence WebNet takes a more general view, dealing with a variety of
modern Internet tools and their integration including services such as
Gopher, WWW, Hyper-G, WAIS, directory services, FTP, email and cooperative
applications and novel approaches from Hot Java to VRML, from Web compatible
teaching modules to 3D interfaces.
