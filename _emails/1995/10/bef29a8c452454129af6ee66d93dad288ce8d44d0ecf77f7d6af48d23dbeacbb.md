I got it at 11:53 PDT.  I just checked the headers and the delay was split
in a couple of places.  (Correcting all times for PDT)

thunk              -> 9:10  -> alcor.process.com. (And they're off and running!)
alcor.process.com. -> 9:10  -> toad.com.          (delivered in 0 time:)
toad.com.          -> 11:29 -> relay3.uu.net.     (Sat on toad 2hrs, 19 min)
relay3.uu.net.     -> 11:54 -> mail2.pilot.net.   (Sat on relay3 25 mins )
mail2.pilot.net.   -> 11:53 -> verity.com.        (delivered into the past!)

Of course these delays can vary a few minutes either way because of
inaccuracies of time clocks on various machines.
