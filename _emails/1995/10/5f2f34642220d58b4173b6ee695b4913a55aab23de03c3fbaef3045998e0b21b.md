You seem to be overstating your point a bit. The real problem here, AFAICS,
is that the proposed protocol in the software wouldn't allow sufficiently 
fine-grained control over the certification authority approval. The user
should be able to specify the conditions under which a CA is to be trusted,
not simply give a blanket approval or rejection. 

It looks as though a set of trusted (CA, site) pairs would suffice. 
How about it, Netscape ?  Give the user the opportunity to say "I trust 
certificates from Alfie's World of Key Certification regarding keys for
interactions with Elvira's Copier Shack."
