My apologies, I should have taken this off-line with Dr. Fred. I did in my
response to him as I had some personal commentary to add which would have
beebn inappropriate to the list in general.


But you are right. These lists are meant for us to exchange important
information and technologies, not necessarily commentary as to what a piece
of merde" something is.

I respect Dr' Fred's commentary and others where there is a "prize" for all
of us, but so much of the postings now happening seem to be of little
technical value.


Again I aploogize to all and to you Dr. Fred for posting my response to
your statement to the world...
