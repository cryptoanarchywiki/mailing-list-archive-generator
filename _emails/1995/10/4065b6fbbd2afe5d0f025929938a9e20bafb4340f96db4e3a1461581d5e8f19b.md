If Bob insists that the bank wouldn't redeem Alice's coin, that's not
Alice's fault.  The bank should have reserved the money when Alice
withdrew it.  Since nobody other than Bob sees the unblinded coin, it's
Bob's fault if somebody else spent it before Bob could.  In the case of
fraud by the bank, since the bank signed the coin, the bank should be
liable if it won't redeem it.

Perhaps the problem is that Bob insists that Alice's coin was not signed
by the bank.  In that case, how about this modification?  Alice should
first show Bob the doubly blinded coin she gave to the bank and the
signed doubly blinded coin she received back.  Bob can verify the
signature and then Alice can give him the blinding factor so he can
unblind it himself.  Bob also needs to sign the singly blinded coin that
he gives to Alice so that Alice can later show that she gave him the
correct blinding factor if Bob tries to claim that she didn't.

Are the any problems with this?
