Who cares?

And if I did care who the "cancelmoose" is, I'd care more about the trail
of evidence "Anonymous" thinks links "cancelmoose" to the eponymous moose
at panix.com. Name space collisions are hardly convincing.

Oh, did I tell you I discovered the real identity of Jack the Ripper? A
finger of ripper@netcom.com reveals some very interesting information. Film
at 11.

Once again, anonymity is being used as a cover for cluelessness.
