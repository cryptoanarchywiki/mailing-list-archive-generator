If you are paranoid, put the detector in a lead box and you are
done. Its not hard to get the lead thick enough that tampering
attempts would be noticed very easily. Trying to shield an object from
radio signals and still manage to get meaningful numbers out (rather
than self generated signal) is a hard problem, but this can be done by
a high school student.
