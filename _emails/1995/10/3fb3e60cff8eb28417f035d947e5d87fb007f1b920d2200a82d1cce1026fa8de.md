To educate the folks about the technologies now more common (mixes, digital
cash, information markets, data havens...), we simulated on paper these
things. For example, certain people were randomly assigned the role of
being a "mix" (remailer), with envelopes addressed to them being openable
only by them, and with them then remailing to the next destination.

The game went on for about 5 hours, amidst much confusion and hilarity, and
helped to show people how ecologies of anonymous and pseudonymous entities
could interact.
