As far as I can tell there is no charge for moving funds between your
ecash wallet and the "mint" at the bank.  The charges are for moving
between the "mint" and the world access account.  If you had a shop
which was able to pay much of its expenditures in ecash it sounds like
there would be no percentage fee to the bank.
