| Could anyone comment on the acceptability and reliability of the 
| SAFER algorithm, in comparison with other algorithms such as IDEA,
| Triple-DES, DES, RC4, ....  Has there been any comparison paper 
| written on the pros and cons of the different symmetric key algorithms?

	There was a weakness shown in SAFER K-64 by Lars Knudsen at
Crypto '95.  It involved a related key chosen plaintext attack, which
derived from SAFER's XOR'ing the data with the key too often.

	It would make me nervous about using SAFER, but I'm just an
amateur at the crypto stuff.
