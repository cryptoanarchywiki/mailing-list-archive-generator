     I'm a professor from George Mason University on leave to do some work 
     with the Joint Economic Committee on the economy of the 21st century.  
     I found your e-mail address attached to some congressional testimony 
     by David Chaum.  Does anyone know when he testified, and before what 
     committee?  Being new on Capitol Hill, I haven't yet found the easy 
     way to find this out from inside the government!
