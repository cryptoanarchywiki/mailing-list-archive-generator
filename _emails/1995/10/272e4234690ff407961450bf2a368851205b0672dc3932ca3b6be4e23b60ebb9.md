   Excellent analysis.  One can't argue with logic, nor should one forget
the purpose and spirit of this list.
   The fact that spamming is in poor taste is irrefutable.  However, some of
the "where did this come from"? responses are starting to sound like some
people are suddenly against the use of anonymous remailers.  I, for one,
would hope that people are simply rising to the challenge of tracing the
routers.
   Kill the message if you are so moved -- not the technological messenger.
