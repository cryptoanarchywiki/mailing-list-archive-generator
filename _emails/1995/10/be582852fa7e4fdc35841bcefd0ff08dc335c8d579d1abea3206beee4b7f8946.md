   I am not supporting the idea that SAIC is not annother govt mouthpiece or
cover op but it is standard practice to hire retired workers from government
that worked in the area that you want to sell services into.

   I know of a ex army colonel that used to work for a government
contractor.  I'm sure that he used his contacts to sell services to the
government.  You gotta love it!

Don't trust S/MIME, it's supported by RSA (a govt mouth piece) and uses DES.
