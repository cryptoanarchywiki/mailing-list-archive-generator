     He might be talking about the (already fixed) bug that allowed an HREF 
     that is longer than 356 bytes to overwrite the stack.  Hadn't heard 
     here that anything would happen other than getting Netscape to crash.  
     No names or URL's were given in the story.  Maybe he needs an update.
     Maybe we need an update.
