They really started earlier this year with the Unabomber threat to bomb 
an LA airliner earlier this year.

The peculiar thing is that skyjackings and aircraft bombings are much 
rarer now than during the '70s.  This is just a control ploy by the 
Feds.  There's no credible increased threat.  They just want to slowly 
introduce an internal passport.

I wonder how many have challenged this.  Since IDs are still not required 
in life, what will they do if you simply present yourself without one.  I 
don't see that ID has anything to do with attack threats in any case.  
Attackers are more likely to have ID than to not have ID.

I suppose they are trying to discourage people from buying tickets in 
false names so that the databanks can be more useful to the authorities.
