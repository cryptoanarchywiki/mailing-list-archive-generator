Big difference is that your neighbors were usually looking out for you..
not waiting to catch you doing something wrong..
Even in the small town I live in, there is considerable privacy even 
though everyone knows everyone else.. people tend to keep their noses out 
of others business.. of course, if you offer to talk, then its fair game 
for the side of the road interrogations <g>
