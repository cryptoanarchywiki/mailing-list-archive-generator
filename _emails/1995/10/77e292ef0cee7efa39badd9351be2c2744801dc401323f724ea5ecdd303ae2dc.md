The PR of Bugs Bounty is the aim, as the quick-market-adapter 
Netscape Chair speechified in FR.


Promoting the notion that hackers are earnestly attacking 
Netscape and reporting its bugs increases its credibility to 
the stock market porkers. Is that not why dear 
all-too-attentive Jeff has been assigned duty on this list, 
feeding peanuts to chimp hackers and champ newshacks?
