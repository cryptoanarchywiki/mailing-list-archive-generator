I agree with the points Jon Lasser makes, whether or not we have the same
political point of view.

I agree with this, but we have to be careful. Consider this parallel:

"It is impossible to stop people from having high-power sniper rifles.
Anyone can shoot people from afar with relative safety. I think it's
unreasonable to outlaw use of high power rifles for assassinations, don't
you."

(I'm not making an argument for gun control, just citing a parallel--one of
many I can think of--where just because something is easy to circumvent
does not mean that it shouldn't be outlawed.)

Agreed. Although it does allow certain new markets to be efficiently
developed that could not develop otherwise.

This is a good point to stress.
