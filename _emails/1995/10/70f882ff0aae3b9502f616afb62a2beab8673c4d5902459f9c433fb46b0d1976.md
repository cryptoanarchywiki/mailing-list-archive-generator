Could it be 9 hex digits = 36 bits?

Perhaps there's an even bigger paradox in there:
  "
   The engine is proprietary, designed according to the rules of modern
   cryptology.
  "

Now I'm not familiar with the rules cited, but wouldn't proprietary
tend to go against them?

Perhaps theirs isn't? Could be a Freudian slip, you know...

Don't worry, the whole thing sounds bogus anyway. I'd say a larger
font would make it *easier* to break (more correlation per pixel).
They probably think it'll be harder because there's more pixels.

No it doesn't.

All right, I guess it does. USA approved export, so it must be very weak.

Is it? I think there are one or two people on this list who think the
intention is otherwise...

Do they mean "salt"? If so why don't they say it?
If not, what *do* they mean?

This is a strange title (I suspect "of" dropped out), but it might
well sum it all up :-)

This can at most buy you a constant factor - useful, but not very.
I doubt the two uses of "significant", too. Anybody remember those
diagrams in Typing textbooks about the layout of a letter?

What do they mean by this bit?


Sorry about being so negative, but it is necessary when evaluating security.
