Postscript is completely safe if the interpreter is emasculated, and
most of them are. (It is a huge risk when run on a non-emasculated
interpreter, but fortunately it is easy to castrate one of the things.)

Java isn't like that, unfortunately. I wish it was simply a
display-postscript like thing that built pretty pictures inside a
confined window -- I could trust that to be done right if it was done
carefully.
