Well the smart thing to do is keep multiple, well-protected copies
of your cash under your own control.  I don't really know what that
press release was referring to.  Perhaps it was saying that by
revealing your blinding factor you can reveal yourself as owner of
that coin and have that coin cancelled and re-sent to you.


To my mind, if you have kept a copy of the blinding factor, you
might as well have kept a copy of the coin...
