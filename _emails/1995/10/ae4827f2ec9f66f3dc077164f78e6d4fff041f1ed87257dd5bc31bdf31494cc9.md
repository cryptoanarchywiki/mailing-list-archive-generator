I agree.  There are some cmavo with enough meaning to warrant some encoding.

Ok, for numbers we take our original 40 bit (or whatever) key and, by
convention, run it through a md5 to produce the key used for the next
digit.  By writing all numbers with 20 digits (padding zeros on the
front or back as desired) magnitude (and/or precision) is hidden.

I'm not sure it gives anything away.  The cryptanalyst would only know
that there's a location, not anything important about the location, since
it could be padded with "null" direction and temporal operators.

And the tense selma'o could probably be treated as a single group for
encoding.  They're only semantically different, not syntactically.  You'd
end up with more confusing cyphertext, but that's no real problem unless
you're trying to hide the fact that you're encoding --- for which you
could stego the cyphertext in a rant generator.

>How about the attitudinals?

There are enough that encoding them as a group hides their meaning.

I think you're underestimating because you're discarding the effect of
having a cypher which can arbitrarily substitute gismu and rafsi.  With
my original examples of "Attack at dawn" vs "Party 'til you puke", there's
nothing to relate the items.  A long sequence of similarly simple statements
wouldn't add anything.  Increasing the complexity of the statements makes
it more difficult to find a false key, but the regularity of Lojban should
give you enough leeway to do it.

You'd probably want to avoid really complicated bridi, but these sorts of
things tend to appear more in literary works than in ordinary communication.

I had in mind the sort of ambiguity that comes from "Time flies like an
arrow", in which any of the first three words could be the verb.  A
computer translator would have to know which to conjugate and which to
decline.

Yep, but it would have to be part of the cryptosystem's definition, as
opposed to the language's.
