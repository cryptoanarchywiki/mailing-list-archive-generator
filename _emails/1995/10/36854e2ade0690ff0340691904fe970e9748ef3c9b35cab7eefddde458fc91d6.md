	If there is no microphone plugged into the audio port, the
random numbers tend to be of very poor quality.  (At least on a sun,
visual inspection of the output shows how poor the numbers are.)  I
suspect a few quick tests, followed by warnings to the user to turn on
the microphone, would be quite useful.

| The code basically reads in a 512-byte block from /dev/audio, then takes
| the MD5 of that block to generate 16 bytes of the OTP. The raw audio data
| I'm getting is not particularly random and will compress by 3:1 using gzip
| or compress, so I'm assuming that using a 32:1 ratio here via MD5 will
| give a truly random output (it's certainly uncompressible).
| 
| Before I release the source code to the Net, can anyone give me any good
| reasons to believe that this won't produce physically random output, or
| make suggestions on how to test, or improve, the generated output ? There's
| a #define which can be used to easily increase the amount of data fed into
| the MD5, but at the moment it will only generate about 1 MB per hour on a
| Sparcstation (limited by the audio input rate), so I don't want to
| increase that if I don't have to.
