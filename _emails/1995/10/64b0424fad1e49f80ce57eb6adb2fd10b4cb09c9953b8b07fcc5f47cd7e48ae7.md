This isn't as easy as you think, and it completely breaks many
abstractions to do this!  PGP does some of this, but not all of it.
It does get the pasphrase one character at a time, however it does
buffer it all before hashing it to a key.  One reason is that you do
not necessarily know how big a session key you need, so you may need
to use different hashing techniques to get different sized keys.

It would be nice if PGP tried to lock its memory pages on OS's that
support page locking, so that some pages dont get swapped out.  But
that isn't a very general solution, since not all OS variants provide
such a mechanism.
