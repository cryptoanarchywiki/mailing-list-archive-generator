Nah. I'll take it back. Send encrypted through usenet, receive 
encrypted through usenet. Best of both, but very slow and only good for 
voluntary mail reception. You could also have an agent doing this 
scanning for msgs and posting unencrypted (or send mail to an  
unwitting spam victim). While it protects all but the last mailer almost 
completely, it's far slower than remailernet and only protects against 
traffic analysis.
