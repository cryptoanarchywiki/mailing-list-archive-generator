There are two interrupts 100Hz and the other 128Hz (The second gets pushed
into the +-1K region during profiling.

Drat. Methinks I need to follow suit, but I value that 1Mhz...

True. VMS could probably do this. <Ducks bricks>

Getting there (I think).

True. Good policing never hurt.

The idea that I like the most so far is to generate noise, but filter
it through an LPF to get frequencies less than (say) 500Khz. Put that
through schmitt trigger to get decent squarewaves and then into an
N-bit hardware shift register with some XOR feedbacks to mix this.
Voila! Nice numbers on demand. Shouldn't cost more than a few <shekels>...

Doesn't work on servers in locked rooms... :-(
With those, as long as the machines are secure, (ie plebs cannot watch
and time raw packets) the network card is OK. The server may not be on
transit ethernet AT ALL.
