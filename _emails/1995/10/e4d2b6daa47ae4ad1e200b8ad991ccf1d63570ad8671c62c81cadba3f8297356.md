Same here.  I also find that it is a good way to let other people -
know- about
ITAR and crypto.  At school I have had around 20 people ask me about 
it.  From
students to teacher to administration.  I also wore mine to a dance 
club here in 
Salt Lake City and was approached by a few people.  I think it is a 
good way to
at least let people know about the situation.  Makes some news 
friends also.
