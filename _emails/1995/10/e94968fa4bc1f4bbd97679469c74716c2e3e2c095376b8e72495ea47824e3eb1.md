I hadn't seen it - everything I said about Netscape (except the money)
applies doubly so to Microsoft - doubly because they have been putting
garbage out for years and should have fixed it long ago.

If you really want to know how this works, you might try reading the 5+
refereed journal articles on the subject, however, to replace the
Integrity shell undetected, you would have to bypass the hardware write
protection on a hard-disk.

"We" - I take it you are now speaking officially for Netscape?  So how come
Netscape doesn't even know how about Integrity shells and yet claims to
be able to design secure systems for money transfers?

That's why the ?

Excellent - I appreciate the information and withdraw my aspersions relating
to fraud.

You must be unaware of Chaos theory.  Even a few hundred million screwed
up in the right way can have a major impact on the global economy. It has
something to dop with the fact that economies work on the basis of peples'
perceptions, not just facts.

It's a deal.
