  I don't share your cynical view of the world.  Having worked for
a year at IBM, I know what that side is like.  I feel pretty strongly
that all employees should have ownership and a vested interest in
the company.  At the last three companies I've worked for, every
employee has had stock options.  I think that companies exist
where management holds the view that you mention, but there are
also companies that value the contributions of their employees.
