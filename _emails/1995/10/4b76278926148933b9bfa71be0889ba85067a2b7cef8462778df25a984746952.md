I was thinking about this the other day and wondered if it wouldn't be
cheap and relatively easy to build a board that samples and sums
several randomly selected signals on various frequencies on the AM
broadcast spectrum.  This should catch stations in nearly all
metropolitan (and most rural areas as well) and would require that
someone be able to broadcast at multiple frequencies to "cheat" it.

Perhaps this would be affected by RF interference from the motherboard
itself.  If so, could the RF radiation from the motherboard itself be
used to generate random numbers?
