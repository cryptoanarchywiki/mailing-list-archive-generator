	"Sue AT&T..."  For free, unsupported software?  In a remark's
from a coward hiding behind an anonymus remailer.  For a problem
that is all in his own mind!

	Matt, you're responding to an annonymous twit spouting ignorant
ravings because if you didn't, some others would think this guy had something
significant to say.  It's a sad state of afairs when someone creates a
great package like CFS and then has to deal with an annoyance like this.

	You think he knows?  You give him a lot more credit than I would!

	To quote one of Gary Trudeau's characters from "Doonsburry" -
"Look!  The clothes have no Empereror!"
