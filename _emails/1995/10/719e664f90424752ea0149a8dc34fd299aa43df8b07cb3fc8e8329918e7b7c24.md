Each person at the party would confirm what their key signature was so the
other attendees could check their handout.  They then take the handout that
they have personally checked the key signatures on home with them so that
when they recieve the keys from yours truly they can compare the
fingerprint they get with the fingerprint the owner claimed for the key,
which they checked against the handout when they were at the party, yes?
