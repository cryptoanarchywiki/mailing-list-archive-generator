|   C'punks, 
|     I just got back from a vacation in Raleigh, and downloaded the
|   new "fixed" Netscape 1.12. It took me about an hour, but I've

Well, I'm still in Raleigh :-) but this doesn't do much of anything
to my Macintosh, Netscape 1.1N, under System 7.5. Looks like a bug
in your X server. However, Netscape 1.1N for Solaris, running under
X11R6 X server, dumps core fairly quickly. I haven't had a chance
to try out the 1.12 version on UNIX or Mac, but the 1.22 32-bit 
Windoze version handles it fine under NT 3.5.1.

Steve
