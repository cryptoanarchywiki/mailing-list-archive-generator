Reading the list does not neccesarily help - I experience a several hour lag between when
I post something, and when it comes back from the list server.  Thus, even if I'm all 
caught up on my reading the list (as I was when I posted that article), articles may be 'in the
 pipe' which duplicate ones I'm thinking of posting. 

For those curious about the latency, I'm posting this at 12:08, on the US east coast.
How long did it take to reach you?

Short of implementing some content-sensitive form of CSMA/CD, I don't see what we
can do (but lowering the list latency would help a lot).
