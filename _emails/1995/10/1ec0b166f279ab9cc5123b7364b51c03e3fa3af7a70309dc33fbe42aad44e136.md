Not really. Wouldn't there be a different politic to reassembling
messages as opposed to anonymous remailing?

Such a reassembly server could cooperate with the authorities, nay, even
precede each message with a PGP-signed list of where the various pieces
came from. On second thoughts that last is a bad idea (because
you might want the first line to be eg a reply block), but such a list
could be published on WWW by Message-ID (or Subject, or ...).

The remailers thus implicated have the defence that they could not possibly
have known the contents of the message, because it was split.

Actually, the same end can be achieved by having a non-anonymous remailer,
which simply decrypts and mails - and cooperates with the authorities.
It doesn't even need to strip the headers. However, such a thing would
probably have no other function than this so it might be harder to run.

(A reassembly server would have the stated function of implementing
k-of-n splits, eg for key/document escrow etc. Pieces coming in anonymously
would be merely permitted, not expected.)

I understand that a post of mine on Cypherpunks had certain piece
of CoS scripture added to it. The original post was signed, and the
person or persons responsible did not attempt to include the
addition within the signed part (merely attached it to the end) so
the signature still checked out.

Even on cypherpunks somebody replied to that addition with the
attribution "Jiri Baum wrote" without noting it wasn't signed by me.

(Called it "drivil", too, but I guess that's between him, his English 
teacher and the CoS.)

Well, I sign everything, don't I? (Somebody please tell me if I don't.)

No I don't have it hard-coded into my mailer. However it's easy enough
to do as it is:
  ":w qqq", switch windows or ^Z, "pgp -sat qqq", go back, "dG:r qqq.asc".

Yup. Why don't you write one? ("cypherpunks write code")


Hope that makes sense...
