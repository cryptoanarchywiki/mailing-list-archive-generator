Yeah, but you can turn them off by having "Test" in your header. I 
disovered this after getting my mailbox filled with those bloody 
auto-responses. It isn't really important since you're posting your file 
encrypted a second time in the first remailer's key, so the received file
will bear no resemblance to the original. 

And as far as wasting a lot of bandwidth is concerned, it would never be worse 
than the alt.binaries newsgroups.
