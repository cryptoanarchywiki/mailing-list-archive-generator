With all respect to you and to Netscape (I am one who thinks that the
Netscape participation on this list has reflected very well on the
participants and the company), I think that the reply "we only collect IP
addresses" is not fully responsive to the issue.  While I recognize that
there are implementations that assign a new IP address to every login, I
understand the current norm to be static IP addresses.  I sure have one. 
Thus, if you keep a file of my IP address, and a fact about that address,
you have a database that can be purchased and correllated with another DB,
which links IP to somehting else, eg telephone numbers (perhaps from a
contest run on the internet?).  Pretty soon we are at serious
profiling....
