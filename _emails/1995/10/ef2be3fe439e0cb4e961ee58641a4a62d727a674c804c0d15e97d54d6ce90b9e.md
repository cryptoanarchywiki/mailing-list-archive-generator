Even if the T-shirts are a joke, it seems like applying for an export
license is a win-win proposition.  If the government denies the license,
they end up looking extremely silly and it's easier to point out to
Joe Sixpack (or a judge) how silly ITAR is w.r.t. cryptography.  If they
grant the license or say one isn't necessary, it might open up the way for
"cypherpunk party-streamers" which also happens to be your favorite crypto
program on colored paper tape or perhaps even limited edition, hand painted,
collectable cypherpunk CDs containing mostly music but with a data track or
two.

The only bad response would be none at all, so I think pushing for one
is worthwhile even if the answer is "that's a frivolous request".
