That's one of the principal advantages of Mixmaster over the earlier 
generation anonymous remailers. Approaching a Chaumian digital mix more
closely than previous implementations, it uses only encrypted standard-sized
packets in transit. This protocol should make it hard or impossible to 
narrow the list down to anything like a single name, depending on ambient
traffic conditions.
