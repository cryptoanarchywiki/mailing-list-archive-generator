Yeah right. Way to go, Jeff.
You even say that OS/2 Windows better than Windows itself. Get real.
Don't you even realize that OS/2 is another OS! It has its own API. 
Stop treating other OS-es whose have emulator with the original one. 
Netscape uses some low-level MS-Windows specific API in order to run 
it well. How could you expect it run under emulator?
Now, wait! .. PowerPC will have OS/2 .. therefore, Netscape will say, 
sorry folks - you have to use Netscape for Windows .. bla-bla-bla.
Get real Jeff. Many people try to improve and make a wonderful product 
better, and Netscape certainly one of it. See how many people have 
pledge (even begged - I heard) Netscape to make Netscape for OS/2 (not 
to mention Amiga (oh ya, I forgot, Netscape will tell Amiga users to 
use Mac version because Amiga can run Mac-emulator - ha ha)).

That's true enough.
