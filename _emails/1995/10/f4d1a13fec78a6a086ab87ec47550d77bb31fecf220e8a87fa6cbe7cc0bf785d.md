## Raw message

I am compiling a quick list (for my own use, mostly) of mail 2 news
gateways to link to from my homepage. (As opposed to, for example,
posting it to Usenet or something)

A while back there was Yet-Another-Rehash[tm] of this theme and I
saved the messages: Homer's lightlink.com and Alex de Joode's
mail2news@utopia.hacktic.nl.

mail2news@c2.org used to be alive, but either wasn't getting the
groups I was posting to or it was shut down. (Sameer: email me please
about this)
 
Anyway, if anyone knows of anything else please tell me.
Oh, and the URL is http://students.cs.byu.edu/~don/mail2news.html

Thanks.
 
Don

Oh, by the way, anyone have any cool PGP/crypto icons to Inline into
my web page? <g>
