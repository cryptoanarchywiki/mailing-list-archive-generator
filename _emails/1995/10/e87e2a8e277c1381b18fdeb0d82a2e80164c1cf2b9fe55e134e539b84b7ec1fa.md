I meant "what if it's mis-reported and actuall goes up to FFF,FFF,FFF?".

Well, if this is actually what they wanted to say, then the 
interpretation I was alluding to was that the contents of the message
is [sent in the] clear.

Don't forget that in most cases it'll be obvious that it's the wrong
key - only when it isn't would you submit the thing to a second-level

Alternatively their whole *framework* is bogus so NSA isn't concerned
about what encryption you use in the middle. Just another possibility.


Ah well...
