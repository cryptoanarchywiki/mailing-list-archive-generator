This is compleate bullshit. Equating bugs on sendmail to adding the above
to your mailcap, is compleately of the wall. Why not try this: compare it to
adding 

	stupidfuck: "|/bin/sh"

Obiously no one in their right mind will put the above on their aliases file.
And please tell me of one MTA does check for this? You want to add to 
sendmail so that it checks for this? Maybe it should also check for
pipes to perl, sed, awk, csh, python, ad nauseum.

Now if you would understand that *people* are supposed to know what to put
into their aliases file, you would understand they need to know what they 
have to put in their mailcap files. There is nothing a program can do 
about it. If you scan for certain interpreters and outlaw them, new ones 
will be created you dont know about.

Your logic is compleatly flawled.

Question: Does your software (your striped down http server, etc)
do this? I bet not.
