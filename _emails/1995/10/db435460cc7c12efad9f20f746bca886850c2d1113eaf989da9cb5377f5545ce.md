I got it at 09:14, Pacific Daylight Time, so there appears to be no lag.

Well, before you all correct me, yes, I now realize it was my copy, sent
directly to me, that I received.

As of 09:35 I haven't received the toad.com-delivered copy.

But my point remains that many times the lags are on local ISP systems, not
necessarily on toad.
