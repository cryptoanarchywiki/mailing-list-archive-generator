   Brian LaMacchia sent me e-mail saying the MIT book _was_ published with the
   OCR font as originally planned. No response to their CJR request, submitted
   in Jan or Feb.

[Blatant plug for MIT Press...]

For reference, the title of the book is "PGP: Source Code and
Internals", ISBN 0-262-24039-4, hardcover, $60.00.  There are links to
the MIT Press pages from my keyserver home page
(http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bal/keyserver.html), or you can go to MIT
Press's site (http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/) and look under
Books/Computer Science.  Orders accepted over the net using either HTML
forms (SSL) or e-mail (PGP).

MIT Press is also selling "MIT PGP" T-Shirts, but I don't have pricing
or size information on them yet.  They have the logo from the book cover
on the front & back.  Front says "Mind your own business," back has a
copy of MIT Press's PGP public key (in ASCII-armored form).
