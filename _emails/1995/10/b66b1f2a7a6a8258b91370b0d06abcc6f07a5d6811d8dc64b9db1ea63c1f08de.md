Actually, you don't - you just don't get signatures without it.
However, authentication AFAIK was never a problem to export,
so there's no need to bother.

If you are reading a signed message, you simply strip off the
signature without checking it (or you leave it on and pass it
through a hypothetical exportable auth-only PGP).

For creating messages, you have to make do without signatures.

What you *would* need would be a coin, but I guess this is
generally available (you know, flip it a hundred times to
generate the session key).

Hmm, just like Monopoly money, I guess.

Nobody's been busted yet for printing that, have they.
