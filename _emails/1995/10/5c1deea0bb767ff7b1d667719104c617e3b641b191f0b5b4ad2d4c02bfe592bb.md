Re: Schlafly v. Public Key Partners & RSA Data Security

I am deposing the inventors, but there are apt to be some loose
ends that I will need to tie down and I may need some expert
testimony.  I'd like to have someone

* with expertise in public key crypto
* with some impressive-sounding credentials
* willing to volunteer to help break some patents

Any suggestions?
