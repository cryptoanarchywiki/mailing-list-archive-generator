Thought you might like another perspective:

Almost certainly unauthorized use.  The us of another person's account
is almost always against school policy, and hence is likely to be a
voilation of the law.

Ignorance of the law is no excuse, and being easy to catch doesn't make
you innocent of a crime.

Interstate transport of stolen (presumably copyrighted) property, possible
violation of national laws of both nations.  Unauthorized use of the
computers at the University of British Columbia.

Reasonable assumption.  The only way to find out different would be to
violate the users' privacy by reading their mail, etc.

Collected possible evidence.  A good idea.  Allerting potential criminals
is a poor way to catch them and potentially dangerous.  May not stand up
in court as it is heresay - not exempt under the normal business record
exception.

Sounds wise.

If he turned out to be a terrorist who was planning to blow up a
building, you would have called this a tremendous piece of police work,
they could have written a million-selling book, and you would hail the
sysadmin as a computer age hero.

Try again.  I assume that they found this was not a "real" terrorist. 
But to call it over-zealous is not right.  S/he was doing the job and
should be commended for trying to do it as well as s/he could.

So Hirsh agreed that he had been illegally using the computer system
and the case was settled with a monetary fine.

So what's fair for Hirsh is not fair for the Sysadmin? Sounds to me like
you think it's OK for Hirsh to have people write nasty letters to the
admin but not OK for the admin to respond via the step-brother.

After Hirsh broke the law, he is trying to get even for being caught by
harassing the people who caught him.

Hirsh realized he was wrong to harass Gorrie and appologized for creating
the situation.  Gorrie gracefully called it a "big misunderstanding" and
accepted the abuse as part of doing a tough job.
