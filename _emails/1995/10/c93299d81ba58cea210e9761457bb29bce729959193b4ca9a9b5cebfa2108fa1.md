The digest version [cypherpunks-d] of the cypherpunks mailing list has 
been moved to a faster host.

Previously it was under the care of majordomo@gateway.com, but it has 
been moved to the care and feeding of majordomo@hidden-foes.gateway.com.

The new machine has a big more disk, a bit more processor, and is on the 
fast end of a T1 [the other was at my home on the good 'ole shared 28.8k 
SLIP].

ANYWAY---->  If you were subscribed to the digest version already, you 
are still there.  If you would LIKE to subscribe to the digest version, 
just send e-mail to 'majordomo@hidden-foes.gateway.com' with the line 
'subscribe cypherpunks-d' in the BODY.

The digest is created every 40k [or about 2-3 times/day it seems].  
Please let me know directly if there are any problems with this new system.

BTW, the first issue after moving to the new system will be Volume 2, 
Issue 1.

Thanks,
-abc
