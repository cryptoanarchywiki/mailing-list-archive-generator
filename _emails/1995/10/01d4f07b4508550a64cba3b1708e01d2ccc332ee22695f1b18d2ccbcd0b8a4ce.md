Such as other coins?

(Since I hate cryptic one-liners, I'll elaborate. There seem to be enough
"degrees of freedom" involved in exchange of digital coins such that payee
and payer anonymity is achievable. "Coin mixes" using "shell game" methods
seem adequate. One puts N coins in, gets back N coins, spot checks the
validity of some of the coins by redeeming them, and everyone is happy.
Fraud is contained to manageable proportions.)
