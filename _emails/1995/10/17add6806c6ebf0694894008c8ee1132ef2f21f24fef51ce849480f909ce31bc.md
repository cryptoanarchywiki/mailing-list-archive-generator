Sorry David,

	The offer was for a server/filter/MITM/proxy that logged clear text
not cyphered text for the SSL stream. Combine your program with SLL code
from other sources and 95% of the program is complete. Add to that a way
to produce a valid certificate for the client and you will earn the $50
and a lot of praise for a job well done from everybody.

For the rest of you, David gave you a small jump start. Checkout the
web pages at C2.org and netscape.com for access to the ssl prototype
code.

Have fun,
