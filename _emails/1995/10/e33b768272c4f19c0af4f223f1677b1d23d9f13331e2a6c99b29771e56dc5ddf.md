Thanks for the post.  Just a thought: there is dead space at the end of
virtually all files, not just small ones.  On average, half a cluster is
wasted at the end of any given file.  Only files that happen to be an exact
multiple of the cluster size won't have wasted bytes (on my main drive, with
a cluster size of 16K, on average about one file out of 16,000+ wouldn't
have any wasted space).
