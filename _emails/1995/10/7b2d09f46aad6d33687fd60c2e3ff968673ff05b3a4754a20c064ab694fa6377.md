This is a KNOWN SPAM (it is currently being talked about in the Net-SPAM
Usenet Newsgroup). It has been coming from 3 sites (one in Italy, one in
France, and one in Germany). The national Police in all 3 countries (as
well as the FBI) are apparently investigating it. To track the situation
monitor this Web Page (Which should be Globally Accessible):
