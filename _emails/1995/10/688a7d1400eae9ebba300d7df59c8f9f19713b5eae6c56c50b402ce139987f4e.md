I think you mean lFindHandle. I'm not a windows programmer, so I have
no idea if the enumerator needs to be cleaned up, but I will forward
your message to the appropriate folks here.

Not really. SEC_SystemInfoForRNG is called ONCE for each execution.
This is true for servers and for clients. Did you rig up a test
bed that called SEC_SystemInfoForRNG in a loop? In addition, if
the server cannot open any more files, it will have difficulty
delivering any information (compromised or not) to any clients.

The clients use the SEC_GetNoise data each time they go idle to
re-initialize the PRNG seed. The servers also re-initialize the
PRNG seed periodically. That function does not use any file
handles.

SEC_FileForRNG does close every file it opens. As I said before,
I don't know what the rules are for closing the enumerators.

The tested servers worked? :-)

The code that was made available for download was the same that
was in the shipped updates.

That was me (Phil Karlton) and not Jeff who put his locks (pun intended)
at risk. You haven't demonstrated to me that there is significant
weakness. I'll keep my hair for another day.

I don't think you are going to get a shirt. It's hard to mail one
to an anonymous person. On the other hand, they are not mine to
give or withhold.
