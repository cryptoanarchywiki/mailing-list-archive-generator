The eagerly awaited "Digital Cash" (with disk) by Peter Wayner 
is available says the publisher:


APProfessional, 1-800-3131-APP.


$34.95.


Don't know if the author offers the special treatment for this 
that he offers for the excellent "Agents Unleashed."


See his musical homepage at 
<http://access.digex.net/~pcw/pcwpage.html>
