There are many ways to test for randomness. you might want to 
start by accumulating instance of "1" and "0" and over a long 
time you should have roughly an equal number of both.  If you 
have access to a spectrum analyzer with an auto-correlation 
function (or cross-correlation will do) feed in similar 
lengths of output at different time intervals and check to 
ensure a low (close to zero) correlation exists.  Also while 
you are at it you might want to checks the ouput's frequency 
spectrum, it should be fairly uniform accross the generating 
range.  Noise (or randomness) which is not normally 
distributed can lead to nasty hacks.

Be Well!!
