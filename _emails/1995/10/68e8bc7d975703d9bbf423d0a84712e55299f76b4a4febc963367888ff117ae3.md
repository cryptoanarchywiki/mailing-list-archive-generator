   10-26-95. Wash Rag:


   "CIA & The Justice Dept. Ground Rules for Disputed
   Territory."

      Officials told the Senate Select Committee on
      Intelligence that the Clinton administration has made
      improving cooperation between the CIA and the Justice
      Department a priority, so they can routinely exchange
      sensitive information on a growing list of topics that
      embrace both domestic and international activities --
      such as terrorism, organized crime, narcotics, alien
      smuggling and arms proliferation.
