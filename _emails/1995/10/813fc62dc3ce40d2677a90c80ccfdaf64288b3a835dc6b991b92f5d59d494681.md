  If you take a look at verisign's home page, they will be offering
"low assurance" certificates for free for non-commercial uses.  The
only thing they will guarantee about these certs is that the subject
name in the certificate is unique across all certificates signed
by their class I CA.  You should be able to get one of these
certs in real time via an HTML form.

  Anyone is free to set up a CA.  In Netscape Navigator 2.0 the
user can decide which CAs they want to accept certs from, or just
mark individual certs as "trusted" no matter what CA they were
signed by.  If you the user choose to trust a CA run by the Mob,
then thats your business.

  I assume that by "null certification" you mean self-signed
certificate.  As I said above, the user can choose to accept
any certificate they want, independent of who signed it.  If you
tell netscape that you want to accept "joe's" certificate for
the purposes of encrypted e-mail, then we don't care who signed
it.
