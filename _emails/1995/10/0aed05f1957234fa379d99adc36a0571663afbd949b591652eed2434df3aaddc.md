Front Page:
`Cypherpunks' asked to breach Netscape, Microsoft security
Desperately seeking hackers

Quotes from Sidebar (How the `Cypherpunks' mailing list works):

"When The New York Times announced a security flaw in Netscape
 Communications Corp's World Wide Web browser software a few weeks
 ago, the `Cypherpunks' hit the big time."

This may be true.  Companies are now asking for their products
to be brutalized by the Cypherpunks' to help ensure security!
This could not be said even a few mere weeks ago.

"According to the group's moderator, who prefers to remain anonymous,
 `The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption.
 Cypherpunks are therefore devoted to cryptography.  They wish to learn
 about it, to teach it and to implement it.'"

Ok, since when is the Cypherpunk's mailing list moderated?

It is apparent that the author, Larry Lange, has never studied the
list closely or he would know how amusing this sounds...

(Geez, if he had ever read one of Tim May's posts on the subject... :-)

Oh well, at least, I was amused.

Regards,
Loren
