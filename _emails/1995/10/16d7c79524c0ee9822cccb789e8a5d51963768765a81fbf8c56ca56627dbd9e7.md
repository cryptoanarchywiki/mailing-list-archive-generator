Just for the record, I'll note this is a fairly old idea (cf. the 
Cyphernomicon, news:alt.anonymous, news:alt.anonymous.messages, etc.)

I don't see how this is possible given widespread RFC 822 compliance. 
Any given message must be sent from some particular address. I see two 
main options:

(1) The remailed-message is sent as a single message from a single remailer.
    That remailer is subject to various sorts of pressure if the remailed-
    message offends its recipient.

(2) The remailed-message is sent as several messages from several remailers.
    The recipient's MDA reassembles the fragments into the remailed-message.
    Any or all of those remailers are subject to pressure if the remailed-
    message offends the recipient.

Either way, at least one remailer is subject to pressure for sending a 
specific piece of email.

(If the token is passed around randomly, then it might be more difficult for 
an adversary to predict which remailer will send the _next_ message. However,
adversaries such as Cof$ are interested in assailing remailers that have
_already_ sent messages, due to the content of those messages. They can tell 
which remailer sent _past_ messages, which is what they need.)
