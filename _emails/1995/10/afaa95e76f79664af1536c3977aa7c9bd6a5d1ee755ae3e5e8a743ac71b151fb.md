Almost right -- it was the UK surveillance service (GCHQ) snooping on
Irish official traffic carried on US-supplied crypto equipment.
Apparently, the equipment in question had a "back door", courtesy of
the NSA; when GCHQ found out that the Irish govt were using this
equipment, they had only to ask their NSA pals for the details.

I only heard the details myself via a popular-science program on crypto
;), so the so-called back door may not have been a deliberately
weakened algorithm, it may have been a set of keys from an key-escrow
repository or some such.
