Alice, 
   Could you please flag your messages with "[POINTLESS WORDY OFF-TOPIC FLAME]"
in the subject line from now on? Since you are going through a
remailer, I can't otherwise killfile you. 

   Alternatively, there seems to be growing support for the "[NOISE]"
standard, you could at least do us all the service of including that. 

   Many thanks.
