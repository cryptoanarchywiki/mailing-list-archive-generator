We are into cryptography because it holds the secrets, not to raising havoc,
but the eldrich gods who inspire it.  PGP is actually a plot by the Old
Ones(tm) to return to the earth to rule again.  Digital signatures are the
invocation to open the gate.  When the stars are near prime and the
algorythm is correct, the Old Ones(tm) will rise from the curves of space
and claim their place as the rulers of the TLAs.

Any other information you are not cleared for at this time.
