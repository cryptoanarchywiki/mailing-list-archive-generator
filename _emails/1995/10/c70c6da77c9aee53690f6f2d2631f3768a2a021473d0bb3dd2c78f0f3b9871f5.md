From "The Daily Californian", Wed., 25 October, 1995, page 3:

<snip>
"Police were called to the scene by an officer who passed Burton
and smelled marijuana smoke, Phelps said.  The officer believed
it was coming from Burton's cigarette.

"The officer issued a citation to Burton for smoking marijuana
and requested to see identification.  Burton refused to show
identification and argued that smoking marijuana is legal in
Berkeley, Phelps said.

"The officer, in accordance with police policy, arrested Burton
for refusing to properly identify himself."
<snip>

That last sentence seemed ominous to me...
