I hesitate to jump in to this exchange given the defensive and
vague nature of the discussion, but...

While I agree that SHA seems preferable, for a number of reasons,
to MD5, it is worth noting that Hans Dobbertin of the German Information
Security Agency recently found a collision in MD4. His attack
allows you to generate a pair of plainexts that generate the same hash.
A fast technique for finding a second plaintext that hashes to some given
value remains an open problem with MD4 (and SHA and MD5, for that   
matter).

As far as I can tell the attack does not readily generalize to MD5
or SHA.
