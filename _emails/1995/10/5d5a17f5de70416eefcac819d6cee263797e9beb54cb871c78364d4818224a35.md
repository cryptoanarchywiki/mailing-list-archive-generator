- From The Economist, Oct. 7, p.78:

   TSB, a British bank, held a launch party in August
   at Cyberia, London's first "Internet cafe", for its
   Digital Trip home page, aimed at attracting student
   customers.

I assume this refers to TSB Bank Channel Islands Limited, 8 David
Place, PO Box 597, St. Helier, Jersey (NOT Joisey!), JE4 8XW.

When I last checked (a couple of years ago), TSB offered Offshore
Premium Accounts -- interest-bearing checking accounts that pay 11.5
percent interest per annum on a minimum deposit of 2000 pounds, as
well as providing a VISA debit card.  TSB is said to be the tenth
largest bank in the world.  Quite an interesting addition to the
Net...anyone checked out their home page?

BTW, the American PBS "Frontline" show on Tuesday, Oct. 31 (in the
Denver area, anyway) will discuss "High Stakes in Cyberspace -- the
business rush to stake claims in cyberspace, otherwise known as the
Internet, may someday create a cyber-revolution."  Hopefully it will
be a worthy successor to their show about Caribbean money laundering,
though the blurb's conflation of cyberspace with the Internet is not
encouraging...
