I have been broswing through the MSN (Microsoft Network), and discovered a 
section in the "SOHO" (Small Home Owner's Guidebook) called "Partners Pages".  
In it there is a list of companies with icons which subscribers can click on to 
view these companies' business/financial-related services.

One of them is the Pinkerton Risk Assessment Service.  I opened & examined 
their several icons, and it suddenly occurred to me how useful this kind of 
on-line information could be to individuals in the new anarcho-capitalist, 
nationally-borderless world. 

Sort of in keeping with the theme which Sandy Sandfort and Duncan Frissell 
brought up with their "lectures" on "Risk" last year, as well as what I had 
said in an earlier post about people in our brave new world needing to become 
imaginative in providing for their own self-defense (seeing as how trusting the 
goverment doesn't work so well), it occurred to me that having information on 
threats to one's physical safety would be fitting for this need - like the RISK 
mailing list is for computers/software.  This kind of data would be different 
from what we can get on the regular news, which is combined with many other 
kinds of news and is very generalized, in that it deals more specifically with 
the subject.

They advertise their services as:

"... the risk assessment tool for the 21st century. If you or other members of 
your company travel internationally, the Global Risk Network  on MSN. is an 
invaluable service, keeping you informed of worldwide events, political 
turmoil, global sensitive spots, and more! Now you have direct online access to 
a wealth of exclusive Pinkerton information, all via your computer. You can 
even order hard copy reports or have customized research performed by Pinkerton 
Risk Assessment  experts, simply type in your request. Tailored for the 
individual traveler, as well as the corporate executive, our risk services give 
you several options to know the security situation anywhere."

Although their services are advertised for the corporate business traveler, it 
obviously is of use to any traveler, and particularly to the person who is in 
the location mentioned.  They have icons opening up to BBSes where they report 
on trouble spots and potential threats in a timely manner:

"The Global Risk Network provides even more detailed country data, including 
 The Daily Risk Assessment 
 Weekly Risk Assessment
 Special reports 
 Statistical analysis of significant incidents
   by country and region 
 Security tips 
 Eye on Travel "

You would think that if the NSA & other State Departments used their services, 
that they wouldn't need to poke around people's computers to better predict 
where to put added security for high honcho dignitaries or State office 
buildings.  But isn't that what the intelligence services are for?  Oh, well. 
Here, I thought, is a great service for the regular person which they can use 
to be prepared for the exigencies of life's little problems, like terrorists 
and other restive types with violence on their mind.

For any of you in the Washington, D.C. area, there will be a lecture from 
Pinkerton next week as detailed below.  If anyone from this list goes, it would 
be interesting to get a post on what they say - the section on cybersecurity 
might be of relevance to the list.

(I got this from the same location on their MSN site.):
