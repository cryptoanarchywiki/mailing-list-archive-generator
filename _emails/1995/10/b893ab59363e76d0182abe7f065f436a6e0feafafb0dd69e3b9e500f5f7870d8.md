New York Times, National Edition, 95/10/03:

A positive sign in the marketing/privacy war on the net:

In his regular Advertising column, Stuart Elliott discusses the presentation
of a report on the problem of "assuring accurate and comprehensive measurement
of consumer exposure to advertisements that appear in interactive media like
World Wide Web sites and on-line services."

The report was issued by "Casie", the Coalition for Advertising Supported
Information and Entertainment, a creation of two main advertising trade 
groups: the American Assn. of Advertising Agencies, and the Assn. of Nat'l.
Advertisers.

Elliott's article identifies three main issues covered in the report. One of
these is privacy:

	"Every effort should be made to maintain consumers' privacy,"
	the report urges, adding that identities of computer users 
	"must not be revealed by audience measurement providers."

If you haven't seen the film "Twelve Angry Men", it's about time you did.
