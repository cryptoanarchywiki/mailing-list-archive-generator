FWIW, this is the company I work for. Not a bad article; more
info is available at: http://www.communities.com/. Three of
the nine people who work here are long-time subscribers to this
list... I was recruited at a c'punks Bay Area meeting.

>      bandwidth -- just as operating systems like the
>      Macintosh OS or Windows 95 manage resources inside a
>      desktop PC. The team is inventing some technology,
>      including a programming language (compatible with Sun
>      Microsystems' new Java language for Internet
>      applications) and a design concept for software building
>      blocks which it is in the process of patenting. In
>      addition, staff cryptographers are weaving encryption
>      throughout the system to make it absolutely secure and
>      private.
