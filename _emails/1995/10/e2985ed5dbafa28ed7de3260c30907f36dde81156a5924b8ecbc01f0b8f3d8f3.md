Please watch your attribution.  Vlad Nuri proposed this rating scheme.

Oops.  Sorry about that.

On another matter, what's wrong with Mr. W of NetScape Communications 
subscribing to this list, maybe even posting once in a while if he feels 
like it, and in general just being a list subscriber like the rest of 
us?  Remember, as Mr. PM says - 'It's not a group, it's a mailing list'.
Mr. Weinstein's sig file says his posts are his own opinions, anyway.  
NetScape biggies have certainly posted on this list before and probably 
will again when they have something they want to send to the list, like a 
press release.  Cut Jeff some slack. (apology to international readers, 
that's an Americanism for quit busting his chops.)
