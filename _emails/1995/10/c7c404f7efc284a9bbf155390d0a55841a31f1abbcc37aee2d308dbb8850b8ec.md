  I don't believe that my posting of PGP signed checksums last night
is a final solution that will make the world safe for all end users.
I'm rather insulted that you imply that I do.  If you read Markoff's
article, you will see that we have stated that we are working on
a more global solution.

  I think everyone agrees that if you don't check the bits you
get from an insecure FTP session, or if you let a bad guy write to
your disk, then you may be in trouble.  The point is that you and a
few reporters are running around yelling at the top of your lungs
that internet commerce is totally doomed because it is possible for
users to infect their systems with viruses.  In the case of
Netscape, users who are worried about their binary being infected
during downloading could actually buy the product, either in their
local computer store or from us directly.

  Perhaps you have a solution to offer to this whole problem?
