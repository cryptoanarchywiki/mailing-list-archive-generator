2400 Americans are imprisoned every year for federal income tax 
violations.  Approximately one person is killed every year in arrests 
involving federal income tax violations.  Millions of man-years are spent 
annually in involuntary servitude to comply with tax laws.  Public 
employees should be aware of the fact that their contribution to society 
is of such low value that it will not be paid for without a gun to the 
customer's head.

Luckily cheap switches and strong crypto will make it harder for large 
monopoly institutions to maintain their controls.  Look around for some 
honest work.
