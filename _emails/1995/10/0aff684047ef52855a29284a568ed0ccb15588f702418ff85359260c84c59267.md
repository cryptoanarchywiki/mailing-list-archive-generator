I am also projecting a transition from physical to non-physical goods and 
services.  Thus most entertainment, financial services/investing, 
professional services, and indeed the rest of employment services will 
tend to be non-physical.  We see a lot of unbundling already in which 
services are split off from the more physical parts of a transaction.  
Drop shipping, contracting out, etc.

Say that it was 1750 and you were a French Physiocrat.  You might say 
that land and agriculture should be taxed because that represented the 
only important part of the economy and the nation's wealth.  The making 
of goods was insignificant.  You would have ignored what was to become a 
big part of the economy.  It is possible that the non-physical part of 
the economy will become much bigger than the physical.

Note that most money itself is non-physical.  And if the physical part of 
the economy is taxed and the non-physical isn't the market will be 
skewed in favor of non-taxed activities.  

Also even though most people are geographically bound, if their 
consumption switches to non physical goods, they can acquire these goods 
anonymously or securely from any place on earth.  So even if you don't 
travel, the locus of your transactions can.
