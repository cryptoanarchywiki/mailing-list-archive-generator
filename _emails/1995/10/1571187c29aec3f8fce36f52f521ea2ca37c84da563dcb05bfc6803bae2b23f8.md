US News & World Report, October 16, 1995, page 28, has a short
article on the shirt in their Washington Whispers column :-)
It's not totally accurate, but it talks about how the Feds oppose
export of "simple but powerful computer programs that can be used
to encrypt electronic communications.  Computer buffs and private
security experts say such restrictions are a threat to privacy -
as well as an absurd anachronism, since the programs are already
widely available.  To underscore the point, one disgruntled citizen
is now offering for sale over the Internet (http://colossus.net/
wepinsto/wshome.html) a T-shirt emblazoned with an encryption program
known as RSA" and a bit more about the shirt and issues
(and Don's refund offer to anyone arrested for wearing it)

Obviously the next revision of the shirt should have a pocket for
the optional non-exportable floppy disk :-)
