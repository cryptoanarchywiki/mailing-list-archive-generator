It depends on how you define certificate.  If you define it this way, then
I'm proposing the elimination of certificates (because I'm eliminating the
unique name as something different from a key).

If you define certificate as I do -- as a bound statement of some attribute
of a key, then it should become clearer.  It's just that the attribute I'm
binding is not some unique person-name -- rather something like permission
to spend money from a bank account.

The rest should be more clear if you read the rest of the backlog....
