That's not me, but I have some things to say anyway.  If I could
figure out how to make DigiCash's SunOS client write money into
ASCII files I would attach 2 cybercents to the end of this.

I prefer to think that contractual relationships are defined by
the explicit stipulations the contract, and the implicit understandings
between the two parties (which are unavoidable, since they begin at
the semantic or even cognitive level and cannot be described
explicitly with our current science/tech, but which should be made
explicit wherever possible), and are completely *un*-influenced by
the arbitrary opinion of some third organization which happens to
own lots of big guns in their geographical regions.

Wouldn't be nice if whatever clauses two competent entities agreed
to were enforceable?  (non-repudiation, reputations, Nick
Szabo's "liens"...)

Indeed they do usurp that power, don't they?  :-)  <I smile happily.>
And it's only going to get worse(/better).  ((anon)nymity, e-cash, tax 
evasion, black markets...)

And I, by way of contrast, consider such clauses, which remove
business relationships from the realm of violence and into the realm
of mutually consensual, organizationally emergent social structures, 
in a very positive light.

And I'm of the opinion that any "regulation" (i.e. threat of force
against peaceful parties) negatively affects my interests (all of
ours) in the long run.  And I too have a vote.


Crypto relevance?  Much!  The overview is that crypto tech will
ultimately enable my view of ideal social structure rather than
yours.  Non-repudiation, e-cash, Nick Szabo's "liens", tax evasion,
black markets, (anon)nymity, reputations and (hopefully hopefully) 
the education/enlightenment of the populace because of powerful
non-censorable information access all point this way.


Of course, it will be a long, twisted road from here to there (we
live in interesting times), but I am ultimately hopeful.


I hope this rant is not wholely without value.  I do it rarely, so 
you are safe for another few months now that I have it out of my 
system.


Regards,

Bryce
