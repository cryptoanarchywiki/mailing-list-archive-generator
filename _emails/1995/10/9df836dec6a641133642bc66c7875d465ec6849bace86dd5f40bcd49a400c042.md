This seems paradoxical. PrivaSoft uses a key approximately 30 bits long. It
is claimed that the key length "is the maximum legally allowable for 
commercial users". How does this square with (to pick a familiar example) the
40 bit RC4 keys used in the exportable international version of Netscape 
Navigator ?

Two possible explanations I can imagine are:

(0) PrivaSoft actually uses a key longer than 9 digits, and someone just made
    a mistake somewhere along the line. Perhaps it's really 9 extended-ASCII
    characters == 9 bytes == 72 bits, rather than 9 digits == 
    ceil(9*lg(10)) bits == 30 bits.

(1) NSA believes it is about (2^40)/(2^30) == 1024 times harder to break
    the PrivaSoft scheme than SSL with 40-bit RC4. That would be remarkable.

I get the feeling you are confusing two separate issues here. Users do tend 
to use easily memorized passphrases, which is indeed a problem, because such
passphrases are in general easy to guess. But cryptosystems are generally
meant to resist attacks based on the cryptanalyst gaining access to many 
ciphertexts, even if all were encrypted with a single key.

Anyone know how to get 120 point text in LaTeX ?

I think this is a smart idea.
