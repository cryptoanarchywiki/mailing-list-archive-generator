C|NET Central is a cable TV show which reports on the 'net.  The
service is their on-line address where you can get more details
on stuff they report.

Doesn't seem to be especially c-punks related, but I guess someone
didn't like the idea of having to reveal his identity just to look
at a web page.  You can probably assume that the password for the
"cypherpunks" userid on the server is either "cypherpunks" or
"writecode".
