   There's a strange anxiety in Markoff's story, as though it
   was planted on page one to exaggerate a threat to cyber law
   and order. Reminds that his articles on Kevin were also
   melodramatic, himself a player, privileged to join the
   hunt. Maybe this is ambient hot material for his burbling
   potboiler on Shimomura and Mitnick, honing an author's
   creative edge, and artistic license, over that, ahem, of
   the tranquil and capaciously befriended journalist's, pissed 

   that privileged news files were hacked, are hackable.
