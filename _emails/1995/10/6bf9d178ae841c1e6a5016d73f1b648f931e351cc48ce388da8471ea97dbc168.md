Risks had a case where (If I recall correctly) Intel was one party or
the other. Seems there were two John Henry Smith's or such at the hotel
and the fax went to the worng one...

I suspected the "wrong" one was a plant by the competing firm.
That and $100.00 to a bellboy would ensure the result.

The question is, how can the 'Punks use this to promote encrypted email
instead of faxes?
