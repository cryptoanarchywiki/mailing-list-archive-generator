  Yes, we couldn't get to this type of stuff in the 1.12 patch.  We will be
doing this sort of stuff in 2.0.

  On unix you can use the csh(1) limit builtin to limit the size
of your netscape process.  As I understand it, the Mac also has
such a thing.  I'm not sure about windows.  Maybe we should put
a preference in Netscape for how much heap memory to use...
