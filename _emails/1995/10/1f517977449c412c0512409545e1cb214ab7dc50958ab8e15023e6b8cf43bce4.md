What is the MixMaster list, and what is it for?
Apologies on my newbie status.

The card's easy to cancel, but the cash ain't.  Credit cards are
cleared with the issuer.  Digital cash with smart cards acting as
transaction observers don't need this.  The thief need only transfer
the cash from the stolen card to his own, just like he does with
regular cash.

Sounds like a better choice.
