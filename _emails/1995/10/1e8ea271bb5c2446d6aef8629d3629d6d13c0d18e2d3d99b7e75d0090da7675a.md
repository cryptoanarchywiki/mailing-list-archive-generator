.u'u I believe that you were wrong when you expressed a symbol for the
list of forms of structure words. There are also words of the form V'V.

On the other hand, however, not all letter combinations are permitted;
eg there are only fourteen dipthongs (of which only four are "normal").

Yeah, and a huge beast it is. If you can make a YACCable language with
one page of rules (say 16 :-) ), *then* I'll be impressed.

Would you believe two grammars for mathematical expressions? No? Good!
There are three (infix, prefix and postfix).

You have to be careful here - the structure words (cmavo) are divided
into groups (selma'o) which have different gramatical functions.
You can't mix up members of different selma'o (in general), so you'd
have to permute within each separately.

Some of these selma'o have very few members (even just one) and/or
may of themselves reveal information.

Yes, but the grammatical structure itself may reveal heaps.
(Except for trivial statements.)

Yup, including font changes, if memory serves!

Not really; you just need to make sure that you conjugate the coded words.
(Ie substitute nouns for nouns, verbs for verbs, etc.)


In Esperanto, the normal words roots (those that need an ending) would
be easy enough to permute... For the rest, you'd have to be careful about
structure words like "cxu" (which turns the sentence into a question),
conjunctions etc which go at specific places of the sentence.

There's plenty enough prepositions to permute :-)

You can probably make do with 1000-2000 words in Esperanto, making
the codebook somewhat more manageable than in other languages.

On the other hand, you would probably have to be careful to delineate
the boundaries, as confusion could result (the breaking up of an E-a
word into the component roots is not necessarily unique, leading to puns
ranging from beautiful (diamanto) through the weird (amoro) to the horrible).
Perhaps that would be a feature, though?


Adiaux!
