BEGIN QUOTE

I'm not suggesting we do away with all forms of anonymity. I can imagine electronic 
communities where anything goes and no one can trace the real origin of 
information - or verify its authenticity. 

You would enter such a community - by deciding to read or watch the information
posted there - at your own risk, and if people said offensive or untrue things to 
you, your only recourse would be to set the record straight in the same forum. 

Consenting adults should be entitled to participate in this kind of community. But 
kids certainly should not.
