  This is kind of silly.  If someone can patch the binary on the fly as
you are downloading it, then all is lost, since they could just patch
it to send them copies of any information they wanted.

  I really don't understand what you are saying here.  Do you mean that
you could intercept a real server's certificate request, and substitute
your own private key, and then intercept the response?  This could be
easily detected by the CA and the server operator, and I think is just
a policy issue for the CA.
