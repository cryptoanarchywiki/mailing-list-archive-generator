  We are using MAXHOSTNAMELEN if it exists, both in 2.0, and in the
security patch that we shipped.  If it doesn't exist we just assume 64.
As a quick sample, on sunos and irix it is 64, and on solaris it is 256.
On sunos and irix it is defined in sys/param.h, and on solaris it is
defined in netdb.h.  I wasn't able to find any mention of it or any
other limits on the host names passed in to gethostbyname() in the
man pages on any of these systems.
