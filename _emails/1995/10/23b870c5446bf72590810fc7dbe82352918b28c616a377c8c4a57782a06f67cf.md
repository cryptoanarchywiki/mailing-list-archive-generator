Was there a recent discussion here about how to write a piece of UNIX code that
discovers a Fully Qualified Domain Name of the machine running the code?  If
so, I'd appreciate pointers to or copies of the good parts (I scanned
http://www.hks.net/cpunks/cpunks-19/subject.html and didn't find what I'm
seeking).  If not, sorry for wasting your time.

Thanks,
Mike
