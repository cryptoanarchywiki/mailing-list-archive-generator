Of course, the attacker would be leaving a very strong pointer back to 
themselves as evidence.

I'm not sure this is really an issue of where the security is layered, 
but rather a flaw in the use of it, in not requiring the unambiguous 
specification of the "service name" (what's in the certificate) beforehand, 
or confirming it after the connection is established.  

You must have a binding between the target URL and the desired "service name", 
regardless of whether you have the security protocol in the session layer (SSL) 
or the application/http layer (Secure-HTTP).
