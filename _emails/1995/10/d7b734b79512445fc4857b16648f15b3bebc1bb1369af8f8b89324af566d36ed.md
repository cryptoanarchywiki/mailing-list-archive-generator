That's not an attack on SSL.   It's an attack on an application.
It's no different, conceptually, than attacking sendmail or MS Word.

The point to attacking SSL is to be able to decode a message from any
browser, without having to do anything extraordinary to the victim's host.
No cryptosystem is proof against an attacker who can see and
control everything you do on the client side (i.e. has root in UNIX
parlance).

So, while your idea #1 might be interesting or fun to do as far as computer
security goes, it's not an attack on SSL.

That points out the flaw in Netscape's authentication model that
others have already pointed out on this list.  Admittedly, like Don
Stephenson just posted, there's not really a good way to distribute
and authenticate certificates until there's a ubiquitous global
CA chain.
