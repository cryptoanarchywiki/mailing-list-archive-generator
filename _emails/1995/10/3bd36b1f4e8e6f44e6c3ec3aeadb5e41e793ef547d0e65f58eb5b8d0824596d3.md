Naturally members of an organization wish the organization to become 
great and powerful:  A great and powerful Netscape would be a 
Microsoft.  A great and powerful NSA would be a KGB or an SS.

Naturally everyone likes their job to meaningful, everyone likes 
their job to have an impact.  Everyone wants to be important.  If the 
NSA are eyes without hands, they are impotent, they are useless.  So 
they want hands.  They want information about us to be used by the 
government, which means they want the government to exercise detailed 
control over us in response to their detailed information about us.

Our function lust would, if fulfilled, give us only moderate 
satisfaction, their function lust, if fulfilled, would give them 
vast power, and hence vast satisfaction.

Our function lust, if fullfilled, would give us more power over computers. 
Their function lust, if fullfilled, would give them more power over us.

Despite grandstanding by the republicans, no government agency has ever
been closed down, or suffered layoffs, merely because its function became 
completely obsolete.  (Though some have suffered renamings and reshuffles, 
and some have been allowed to shrink through natural attrition)

The guys who used to control prices in the trucking industry now work 
full time regulating each other.  (I kid you not)  We are still stockpiling
helium to lift a fleet of dirigibles for world war one.  (Like Dave Barry, 
I am not making this up, though the Republicans have planned to close down 
the helium agency.)

Job preservation is irrelevant:  They are government employees.  
Power is the issue.
