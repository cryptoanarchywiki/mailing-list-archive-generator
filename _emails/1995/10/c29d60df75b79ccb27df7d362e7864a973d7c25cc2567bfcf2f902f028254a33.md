Theoretically, when I pay sales tax I get something in return (better
roads, nicer schools, improved NSA wiretaping, and other government
services.)  With digicash, you're paying for the use of the money
itself.

What sort of charges do Visa/Mastercard impose upon merchants?  I
thought it was 3%; if so, I would suspect that this is the level of
"off-the-top" skim that the market will sustain, and DigiCash should
probably use a similar rate.
