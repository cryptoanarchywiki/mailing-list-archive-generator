Hi,

	I would discount the possibility of the cancellations being by a
Microsoft employee. I spoke to a very senior Microsoft person who was well
aware that security of Microsoft products would be examined and that chances 
are that bugs would be found. Point being that they would much prefer the
to be discovered by people who tell them about the bugs rather than people
who aim to exploit them.

	If you have pissed of the Church of Satan then what do you expect?
They will get what is comming to them sooner or later and I expect that it 
will take judicial and unpleasant form.

		Phill
