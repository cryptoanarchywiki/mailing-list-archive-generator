One need not automate the process of setting up anonymous accounts. One
might also require some sort of exchange before activating the nym to
verify that the return address is working.

I agree. With both free and for-fee nym servers must clearly spell out what
actions will result in the termination of the nym. Perhaps 1 spam, 1
systematic harassment, or more than 5 serious complaints per month. Obvious
this would need to be tuned to preserve free speech while allowing abusers
to be quickly squelched. I would imagine an ecology of these servers would
develop with some short lived permissive servers mixed with long lived more
restrictive ones.
