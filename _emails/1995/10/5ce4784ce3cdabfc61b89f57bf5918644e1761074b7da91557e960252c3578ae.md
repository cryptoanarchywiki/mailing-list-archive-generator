I got it too.  It was a pretty good forgery, but the web pages mentioned
seem to be owned by treborle@netcom.com.  It looks like a hit-and-run spam,
as he hasn't logged in for awhile.  But since netcom charges for disk space,
I took the liberty of mailing him a few uuencoded core files. :)  You might
want to send a few to his compuserve address too for good measure. 
(73323.603@compuserve.com)

It looks like their web site www.natvan.com got taken out already, tho they
still have the netcom one.
