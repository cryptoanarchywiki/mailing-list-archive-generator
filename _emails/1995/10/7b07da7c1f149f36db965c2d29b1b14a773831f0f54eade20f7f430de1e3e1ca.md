Yes, I am still a US citizen, so far. 

The corporation I work for is a legal entity of Anguilla.  I would not
personally be selling it, the corporation would.  Do you think that is ok? 

What if I had a couple Anguillian friends form a corporation for this
purpose (buying encryption software written in Anguilla and selling it
internationally)?  No trouble yet, right?  What if the people who come and
write it are US citizens?  

I don't see how US law can cover corporations in other countries.

PS - it is good to CC me (as you did) as I only get cypherpunks-lite, and
so may not see a message, or it may be delayed. 

Thanks,
