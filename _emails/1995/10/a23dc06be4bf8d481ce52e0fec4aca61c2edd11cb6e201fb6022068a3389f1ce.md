The snippet from network week (that hit my box via this list with no
subject line, not even a "blank", how do they do that?) suggests Mondex is
keeping transaction records.  When I put this exact question to the head
of Mondex last week, he said that the cards were capable of this, but that
they had not decided whether to do it or not.  The clear impression,
although in retrospect perhaps not the clear statement, was that they were
not doing it at the present time. 

Interesting.
