(1) It is impossible to stop these technologies; someone on the list 
recently reminded us that a bright fourteen year old could reproduce the 
basic functionality of PGP in a brief period of time.  The mathematics 
of, say, RSA, are fairly basic.  I think it's unreasonable to outlaw 
multiplication of prime numbers, don't you?
..........................................

Uh-huh, yes, I think it's dumb to think of outlawing the right of mental 
creatures to engage their faculties to their full potential, especially in a 
country which defined encroachments upon it as a crime.

"Unreasonable" people will always try to get something for nothing, with 
nothing, while in conflict with those who could & would develop the means to 
deliver it.
