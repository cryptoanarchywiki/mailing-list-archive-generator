As a non-crypto, latency-related, aside.  The USENET newsfeed coming out of
uunet to my ISP was non-existent last week.  It's improved somewhat, but is
still lagging behind by 2 or 3 days (never did this in the past).  uunet has
not provided my ISP with an explanation as to what is happening.  Perhaps
it's related to the delay in list messages appearing.  Unfounded speculation
has been the .edu sites are active again after the summer and are swamping
things.

Thomas Jefferson used strong crypto, shouldn't you?
