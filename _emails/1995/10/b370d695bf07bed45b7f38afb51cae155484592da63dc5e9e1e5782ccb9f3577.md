Well, why not one of us?

Please have a look at http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/~jirib/ecash-cc.html
and tell me what you think. Any good?

Easy: whoever is at the bank first gets the cash. So you simply spend
all the coins (ie deposit it back to your account), and that's that.

Yup. No special protocol is needed, either.

I read in the newspaper that the "Eros Foundation" (or whatever the name
is) has the second-largest mailing list in Australia. (The article was
about how they could affect elections should one or the other party promise
to ban X (non-violent erotica), and generally concluded that they could,
if they haven't already.) I wonder if that'd be a good market for
untraceable transactions?


Please tell me what you think of the page...
