Use the right tool for the right job. Cycle sales are useless for most
applications, and forcing a square peg into a round peg will only result in
frustration. There are a gazillion useful outlets for this technology,
though - more pop up all the time. The latest I heard today was OCR .tiff ->
.txt conversion, where the payee can afford (cpu-wise) to toggle all the
settings to the highest (slowest) quality.

Voting - send the same data to 3+ unrelated machines (if you can afford
redundancy) and accept the 'majority opinion'.

Sanity checking - depends on the algorithms in question; may require human
intervention in many cases, where errors (accidental or not) may not be
easily machine-recognizable.

... just to name a couple of the top of my head.

>3.  Similarly, many such applications are highly confidential.

This is the easy one :) That is to say, solutions to this problem are
already being implemented for other applications.
