A) Maintanence requests come in through the remailer network. Someone
tcp sniffing my incoming network would only see SMPT packets coming
froma remailer.) and the SMTP messages would be encrypted with
alpha.c2.org's key.

B) See (A)

C) We don't keep any information about the owners of anonymous
accounts. We will gladly give up any information we have given a
properly executed court order. The important fact though is that we
don't have the information that an LEA would need to find the person
publishing the materials that the LEA doesn't like.
