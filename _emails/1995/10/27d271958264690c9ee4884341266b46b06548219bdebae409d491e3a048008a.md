10-6-95. WSJaper has a report on the global rise of unions 
between banks and telcos for exploiting electronic 
marketecture.


Quotes:


"Being in partnership with these phone people is like shooting 
adrenalin into your veins," gushes one banker who recently 
invested in the national phone company.


"Bricks and mortar won't do it," says another banker, "you have 
to drive down the transaction cost."
