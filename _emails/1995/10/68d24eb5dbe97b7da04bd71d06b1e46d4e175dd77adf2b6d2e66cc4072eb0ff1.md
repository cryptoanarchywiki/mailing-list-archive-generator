Still, there is a problem here: how did the bank know that it _should_
honor requests to withdraw money from bank account x if they are signed
with a certain key?  How did it determine that that is a valid key, if it
never had a secure channel to the person opening the account?  I think
the answer is clearly that it cannot, that it must have had a secure
channel.  Would a certificated key presented by Alice have been
sufficient to create such a channel, do you think, or would a face to
face meeting have been necessary?  (Or would an uncertificated key be
adequate?)

What if you are accessing the bank via a MITM?  Consider this example:
Alice writes you a check, signed with a key (without her name) which
has a credential from the bank saying that it will back up the check.
But you need the bank's key to check the credential, so Alice gives it
to you, or you get it from a public cache.  Suppose the bank's key is
fake, and Alice is defrauding you.  How do you tell?  Wouldn't a
certificate on the bank's key be necessary, one which ties the bank's
name and reputation to the key?

Or what if the bank really is and has always been behind a MITM?  You say
that it is more profitable for the bank not to abscond with your money.
What about the MITM?  He doesn't make any profits until he cheats.  He
might well be collecting information which will allow him at some point
to abscond very successfully.  Would you really trust a bank which was
known to you only by a key and by a record of never having defaulted,
knowing this was a possibility?

Same problem as before: how does the credit card company know that the
key it is putting on the card is really Alice's?  What if Alice discovers
unauthorized charges because Carol was a MITM and substituted her key?
We can't just ignore this possibility.

It seems to me that a lot of protocols assume the existence of secure
channels.  Yet the MITM attack shows that public key cryptography does
not in and of itself provide a secure channel.  This is a problem which
IMO should not be ignored simply because it is inconvenient.
