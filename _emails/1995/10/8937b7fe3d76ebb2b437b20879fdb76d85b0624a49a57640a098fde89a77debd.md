What a fucking joke. The Samba development community told Microsoft about
this in *January*. Microsoft's fix for the same problem in Windows for
Workgroups is dated September 28.

They must not have asked anybody, then.

Good for them.

Microsoft is also investigating a bug where you can map whole unshared
drives over IPX or SMB. Maybe they'll acknowledge the problem in February.

This is incorrect. The acknowledgement of the bug, which was pointed out
to Microsoft in January, was not available until October 12.

I wonder what illegal commands they're talking about. All you have to do 
is "cd ..". The problem is that Microsoft assumed that anyone using SMB 
was mapping a drive on a WinTel box, and thus couldn't cd below root. They
provided no mechanism on the server end to ensure that this didn't 
happen.

The problem was not limited to SMB over TCP/IP; Samba was merely the only 
radily available software to (inadvertently) expose the problem.

What a novel security feature. I am so glad that Microsoft came up with this.

Yup, they won't install on other language versions. So they're still 
vulnerable.

Yes. Tell them about a huge, stoopid bug in January, and they will
acknowledge the bug in mid-October. In the meantime, they will directly 
lie to the press and users about it.
