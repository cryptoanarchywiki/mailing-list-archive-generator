The Amiga 2000 had two sets of slots - one for amiga-specific cards,
and one for PC cards. Some of these slots lined up, and you could 
slip in a 'Bridgeboard' which carried an Intel processor.  It could
access the PC slots, the amiga IO, and had it's own disk partitions. 
There were mechanisms for the two processors to exchange data as 
well.

I *think* there was a similar MAC product as well, or at least a board
which could carry MAC ROMs, and used the Amiga 68000 processor.

So the  answer is: yes, the Amiga could do that. It also had long
filenames, thousands of colors, true preemptive multitasking, stereo
sound, a DSP coprocessor,and many other neat features years before
they were available on other consumer systems, as well as display
quality and features still unavailable on any system even near its 
pricepoint.

But - Commodore's marketing department couldn't sell ice in the
Sahara.

I'll stop now, or I'll start mourning for TOPS-20 as well...
