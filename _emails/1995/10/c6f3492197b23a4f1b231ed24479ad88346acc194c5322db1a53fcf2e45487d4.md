Crypto is used for making sure that insiders get in while outsiders are
kept out of encrypted files/messages.

Strong crypto does a better job of keeping outsiders out.

Things like TIS CKE are mechanisms for making sure that insiders continue
to get in, in spite of mishaps with their keys.


Any such system can be evaluated on its technical merits (does it really
separate the insiders from the outsiders as well as it claims to?) (does it
survive various disasters (because if it doesn't survive, it can't keep
insiders in)?)


This is a separate topic from GAK -- which boils down to the Government's
claim that it should be listed as an insider for everybody.


That's what needs to be brought to everyone's attention.
