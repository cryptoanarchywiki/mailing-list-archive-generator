Not all of them.  In at least one (VMS) you can pin pages in physical 
memory,
i.e., prevent them from being written to disk.  Actually, any OS that does 
I/O
directly to user pages has that capability in the kernel; in the case of VMS
(and possibly others, I don't know) it also exists as a system service that
applications can invoke.

This solves the problem: you can pin a suitable number of pages, and put
your sensitive data buffers there.
