The following post make me think. What if the goverment could decide to 
interpret the meaning of the word foreign however they wanted. They could 
then say that anyone dealing with extra-terrestrials were foreigners, or 
that anyone not aligned with their thinking was a foreigner. I think 
that's the direction they're taking.
