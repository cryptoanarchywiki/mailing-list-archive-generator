[Paul: cc'd you about legal question about who it is that "exports"
the person downloading or the person with the server, you made a
comment on this a short while ago in one of the crypto groups (below)]

Hadn't seen the blacklist.  USSR now has it's own blanket crypto ban,
a translation of the Russian text of the presidential decree was
posted by someone a while back.

Sorry, that one was I think got from reading USENET, or at least I no
longer recall where I read it, so I can't vouch for the accuracy of
that.  (I should have disclaimed that).  Perhaps someone else knows
enough to refute, or validate that.

But I was reading about the COCOM restrictions this morning on
Bert-Jaap Koops crypto law survey page:

http://www.kub.nl:2080/FRW/CRI/projects/bjk/lawsurvy.htm

and it says this about COCOM:

I'm not sure if it's unofficial policy or law.  One place I remember
reading this was in one of the crypto groups, Paul Leyland expressed
this view in a recent post to one of the crypto groups.  This was to
do with potential "export" from ftp.ox.ac.uk, which he has something
to do with, and which contains copies of PGP (as well as nautilus,
pgpfone, various encrypting file systems, etc).

Here's my list of relevant sites, with info on EU crypto laws:

http://www.kub.nl:2080/FRW/CRI/projects/bjk/lawsurvy.htm
ftp://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/doc/security/crypto/euro-clipper.ps.gz

I have been trying to maintain a list of them on:

	http://www.obscura.com/~shirt/

for political background for the munitions T-shirt, in the hope that
some people who browse it will read it and come away more aware than
they were before.  The main thing which worries me at the moment is
the implications of the eu-clipper: the secret service agencies of EU
countries have been plotting this for a while now, and probably have a
clipper like attempt on their agenda.  Ross Anderson reported that
there had been a secret meeting of secret service organisations
earlier this year, to discuss

This comment was some time before the latest EU-clipper goings on were
announced.
