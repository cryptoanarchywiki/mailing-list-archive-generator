[someone crossposting to a ton of alt groups about spam, the headers:

Newsgroups: news.admin.net-abuse.misc,
soc.culture.german,
soc.culture.jewish,
rec.radio.shortwave,
alt.2600,
mail.cypherpunks,
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
alt.privacy.anon-server,
alt.stop.spamming,
alt.stop-spamming]


It's started already.  This is because of "mail.cypherpunks" in the
huge newsgroup line?  A news to mail gateway pointing at
cypherpunks@toad.com?

Any chances of disabling this before it gets out of hand?

Who runs the gateway(s)?  Make it read only please!  Or change the
gateway so it doesn't forward if there are other groups on the
newsgroup line or something.
