Actually not a problem for mess-DOS: just overwrite to the next multiple of
the allocation unit size. Trivial indeed.  What you must *not* do is just
write to the end of current file ... you have to extend.  Good idea too is to
flush file buffers/reset disk subsystem before the next file writes so that
buffer garbage doesn't get stuck in at end of last sector(s) of new files.
