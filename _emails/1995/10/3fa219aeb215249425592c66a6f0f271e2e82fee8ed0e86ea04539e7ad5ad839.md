Thanks for the suggestions.  These features have already been implemented.
WRT to anonymity, I plan to add link encryption after releasing the first 
version.

I believe that using SOCKS requires changes to the application.  This 
will not be necessary with ETT, although as a price the user will have to 
do more work.  It may be possible to write a SOCKS to ETT adapter program.

ETT will allow the server to filter based on both the client's public key 
and the destination address.  I'm not sure how to implement this yet, but 
I hope to come up with a filtering scheme that will be general enough to 
be useful for many applications.

I completely agree with you.  I don't think there will be many free 
public accessable ETT servers, because of the above reasons.  Most ETT 
servers will probably be operated for private purposes.  Those that are 
not should either charge money to cover their expenses and risk, or allow 
connections to only a small range of addresses or ports.
