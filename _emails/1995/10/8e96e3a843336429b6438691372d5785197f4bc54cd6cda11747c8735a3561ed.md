No,. of course it isn't.

But copying the  www-buyinfo@allegra.att.com mailiing list on a post, as
you and some others did, is much more than following the list with
hypermail and other such tools: it is actively posting to two mailing
lists.

Sometimes this is OK, but often it results in two lists only marginally
educated in the issues of the other list.

I replied at more length to Ali in private, but will say here that anyone
is welcome to join the Cypherpunks list and to read up on the FAQs and
archives of past discussions.
