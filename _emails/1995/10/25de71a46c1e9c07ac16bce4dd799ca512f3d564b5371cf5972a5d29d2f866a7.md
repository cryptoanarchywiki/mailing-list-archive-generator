The Fido remailer appears to be drawing some interest. Fidonet is often
criticized (by me among many, many others) for being dull, provincial, and
dominated by power phreaks.

However, the Fidonet connectivity protocols have much to be admired from the
'punks perspective. Internet has great speed and bandwidth, but network
routing is "hardwired." Fidonet is frequently slow and narrowband, but
routing is much more flexible. The so-called "nodelist" contains the node
number (the equivalent of IP number), various technical parameters, and the
dial-up telephone number and availibility schedule at which e-mail/data calls
can be accepted.

Since the access number of every site in the network is known, you can send
e-mail directly to the destination site if you wish not to use standard,
fixed routing. This, plus call forwarding and laptops at pre-arranged
temporary locations, means Freeh's wiretap problem is now the need to monitor
every call at every ESS.  Hence, his curious request for huge wiretap
capacity.
