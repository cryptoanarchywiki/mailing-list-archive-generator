I've never attended a key signing party so I'd like to get some input on
the most effective way to run one.

What I have in mind is to have everyone who is planning on attending send
me their key and its fingerprint.  I'll collate the lot and print enough
copies of the list of names/fingerprints so that once everyone shows up,
each person can get a handout.  Everyone presents ID showing who they are
and reads off their fingerprint so the attendees can check them on their
handout.  Afterwards, I'll email all attendees the keys so they can sign
them and mail them back to me.  Once I receive the signed keys, I'll
redistribute them back to the owners & attendees.

This seems like a lot of work, which I don't mind, but if there is a more
efficient method, I'd like to know about it.
