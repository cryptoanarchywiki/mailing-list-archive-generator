Yes. The README was not as explicit on this point as my original
message. SEC_SystemInfoForRNG is indeed among the global initialization
routines.

As was stated in the README, I cannot publish that code. It's derived
from (and remarkably similar to) code that Netscape has licensed. It's
not ours to divulge.

There seems to be little point in extracting isolated lines of
code out of the source to "prove" that we use the functions we
claim to use. If you have familiarity with RSAREF or the BSAFE
toolkit, you will be able to see how we mix and extract the
"random" bits.
