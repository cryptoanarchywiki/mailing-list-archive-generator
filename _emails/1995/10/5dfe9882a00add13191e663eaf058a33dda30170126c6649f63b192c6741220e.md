sending mail to myself (not going through list processing),
via toad.com, It took 32 seconds for my host to find, contact and send
the mail to toad.com, then it took more than 5 minutes for it to come
back, and specially it came back as :

Received: from relay3.UU.NET by hplyot.obspm.fr with SMTP
	(1.36.108.10/16.2.5) id AA05486; Mon, 2 Oct 1995 19:48:39 +0100
Return-Path: <dl@hplyot.obspm.fr>
Received: from toad.com by relay3.UU.NET with SMTP
	id QQzjtb16149; Mon, 2 Oct 1995 14:47:28 -0400
Received: from hplyot.obspm.fr by toad.com id AA02554; Mon, 2 Oct 95
11:42:59 PDT
Received: by hplyot.obspm.fr
	(1.36.108.10/16.2.5) id AA05454; Mon, 2 Oct 1995 19:42:31 +0100

So the question now is :
 "Why the toad.com send its mail through *.uu.net instead of sending
  it directly ?"

[it would/should cut at least by half the delay {at the coast of more
DNS traffic for toad.com}]

Also I suspect the long delays we sometime see comes from
toad<->uu.net interactions [besides the normal overhead of sending one
mail to thousands of people]

(the service is great anyhow)
