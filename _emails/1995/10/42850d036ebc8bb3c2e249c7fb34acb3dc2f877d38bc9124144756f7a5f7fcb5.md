Tim, a friend comments that if you're serious about getting
reports this way, you should contact one of the human rights
groups (Amnesty International, Article 19...) that gathers
reports which are generally believed to be accurate under
much more threatening situations.

I thought it a good comment.  I've worked for amnesty before,
and know of their reputation, but now how they attained it...
