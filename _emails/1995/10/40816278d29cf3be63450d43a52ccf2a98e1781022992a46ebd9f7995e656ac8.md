What you miss is the distinction between different kinds of programs and
their protection implications.

	Networking programs with unintended flaws may allow outsiders
	to gain access to your internal network and do harm.

	Non-networking programs with unintended flaws may fail to operate
	properly or act as a vector for the spread of corruption, but
	they don't give outsiders unlimited insider access without insiders
	somehow facilitating the process.

That's why we are far more concerned about networking programs that about
word processors.

	In terms of word processors with Trojan horses, we don't want
them either, but there's a big difference between a Trojan horse and the
ability to spread a virus.  Viruses can spread whenever there is sharing
and general purpose programming.  Hence, most modern spreadsheets, word
processors, Postscript interpreters, etc. allow viruses to spread.

	A big problem with remote auto-execution is that it allows
someone not authorized to use your computer decide to run a program on
it.  This may make you the unwhitting vector for a virus, cause your
system to crash, etc.  With auto-execution, the web turns from a
networked read-only database with limited searching capabilities into a
giant distributed processor in which the users have little or no control
over what their computers are used for.

The battle is for control over your own computer and what it does.

I don't see any huge benefits to postscript.  In fact, postscript files
are essentially impossible to search for items of interest, to display
on a normal video screen, to quote from without reentering the data, etc.

The point is, do we want to turn the Web into a distributed computing
environment in which anyone can eecute any code on anyone else's
computers?

	Don't assume I am against it - after all, I was the only vocal
	proponent of viral computing for almost 5 years and got
	villafied for it plenty of times. 

I am in favor of making the decision conciously, not by accident or
ignorance, and providing proper protection mechanisms.  If the question
of Hot Java is asked in terms of permitting all computers using the Web
to become part of a global viral computing environment, I am ready to
hear the answer.
