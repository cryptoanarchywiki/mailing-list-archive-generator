What is the "difficuly of finding primes"? They are actually very easy to find.

A few comments:

First, the "1024 bit prime" is misleading. The 320+ decimal digit modulus
used in RSA has two prime factors of roughly 160 digits each.

Second, the process of finding the primes p and q involve avoiding "weak"
moduli, such as where p and q are very close together. To avoid this, a
common situation is for p to be roughly 159 digits and q to be 161 digits.

Third, these are _really, really_ big numbers! There are about 10^158
primes between 10^159 and 10^161. roughly. (The rule of thumb, given by
Sterling's formula, is that about 1% of all 100-digit numbers are prime,
about 0.1% of all 1000-digit numbers are prime, etc.) As there are only
about 10^75 particles in the entire universe, this gives about 10^83 primes
for every particle in the entire universe!

Fourth, the standard way to find the primes p and q is to pick a random
number of the approximate starting size and then iterate up, testing for
primality. As the above approximation shows, one doesn't have to make too
many tests before a number is confirmed to be very likely to be prime. (I
say "very likely" because the most popular primality testing routines have
a very small chance of saying a composite number is prime, when it isn't.
Cf. math books for details on this, and why it is essentially irrelevant to
us.)

Fifth, there are clearly some really good ways to pick a 150 or 160 digit
number to start testing from. For example, a 10-sided die, or a pair of
traditional dice (ignoring 11 and 12) could be rolled 150 times, with the
resulting number used to start the process. Not bloody likely that any
collisions in such a choice process will occur before the heat death of the
universe.

(There are faster ways, using the random sources we so often talk about,
including keyboard poundings,  mouse swirlings, audio input, radioactive
decay, diode noise, etc., but I wanted to make the point with the rolled
die so nobody will ask "Yeah, but what if people picked the same starting
point?" They won't.)

By the way, all of the "entropy" or "randomness" in the p and q primes lies
in the initial seed for the search for the first prime larger than the
seeds, as the algorithm is completely deterministic once the seed has been
picked. (And fast, too.)
