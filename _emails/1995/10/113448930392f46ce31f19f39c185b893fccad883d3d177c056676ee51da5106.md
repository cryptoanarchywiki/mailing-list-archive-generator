I had missed this in your original posting.  Here it is again:

Chosen plaintext attacks against RSA don't work in the context of RSA
signatures, because the input to the RSA algorithm is a hash of the
message being signed.  You can't control the hash the way you need to to
implement a chosen plaintext attack.  (You can't "choose" the hash.)

For example, one kind of chosen plaintext attack would be to get an RSA
signature on 2, on 3, on 5, on 7, and so on, on all the primes.  This
would let you create an RSA signature on any number by factoring the
number and multiplying the RSA signatures of its prime factors.  But
there is no way to do this in practice because as RSA-based signatures
are actually implemented only hashes are signed.  This is done exactly to
prevent this and similar attacks.
