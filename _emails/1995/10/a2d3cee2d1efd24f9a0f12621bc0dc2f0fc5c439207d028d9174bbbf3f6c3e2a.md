This might very well be true for a restricted set of images, but
I seriously doubt that arbitrary color photographic images take
three times less space with this system than with JPEG given
comparable retention of detail.

Also, are we suggesting that images transmit exactly three times
faster as both GIF and JPEG.  This is somewhat odd, given that
the difference in size between the two latter formats is often a
factor of ten? If you can beat JPEG by a factor of three, you can
beat GIF by about a factor of 30.

If you really can do this, you should be working on MPEG-4, and
not spamming our nice little list with advertising material.  I
should point out that neither Fractals, Lapped transforms, or
Wavelets can beat JPEG by a factor of three, and neither, I
suspect, can you.

JPEG can do this quite easily with either the progressive or
hierarchical modes of transmission.  Why reinvent the wheel?

The engineering graveyard is littered with the bodies of various
entities who announced spectacular image compression advances. In
each case, reality dawned shortly after the hype died down.

It's been done.  Do the words "low bandwidth videoconferencing"
ring a bell?  I'll be truely surprised if you can beat
PictureTel's complex proprietary algorithm for sound and image
compression.
