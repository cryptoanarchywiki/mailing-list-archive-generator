Uh, I must have been asleep and read your comment as Netscape 2.0 Java 
did not run on SunOs...Perhaps you can understand my confusion when it 
says at http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/unix/ :
"The IRIX and Sun Solaris versions of Netscape Navigator 2.0b1 include 
Java support."  With no mention of SunOs.  But looking at the ftp sites, 
I do see the 20b1J for SunOs4.1.3.  Yey!
