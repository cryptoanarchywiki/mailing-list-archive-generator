When you see a glaring hole in argument for a government program, you 
should smell the stench of fish in the air.  That is the section of the 
puzzle that is being hidden until a politically "ripe" time to stick it 
in place.  Here that piece is, obviously, banning tomorrow's pgp.

I'm not so sure it's paranoid.  You have trial baloons floating all 
over.  Freeh is a prime example, and no one is screaming loudly enough to 
shoot down his blump.  That's a big'ole green light for regulators.>
