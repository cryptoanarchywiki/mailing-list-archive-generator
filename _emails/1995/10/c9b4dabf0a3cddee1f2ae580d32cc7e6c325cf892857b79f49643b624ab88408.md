   I got the CJR back today, envelope unopened (although the corner was
torn so you could see there were t-shirts inside). "Returned to sender",
it said, "Refused___, Unclaimed___".

   The address on the envelope reads:

ATTN: Samuel L. Capino - 15 day CJR
Defense Trade Analyst
U.S. Dept. of State
Office of Defense Trade Controls
PM/DTC SA-6 Room 200
1701 N. Fort Meyer Drive
Arlington, CA 22209-3113

   Did I do something wrong, or did the Dept. of State decide it
didn't want to deal with this CJR?
