        I don't know the person, but I posted your note--and, BTW, thanks
for responding--to alt.hackintosh, where the above web page proffering this
pseudo-crack is regularly mentioned; I know that "abusby" monitors the
group (and maintains a big hacking BBS), so hopefully he'll pull the crack
from circulation.

Cheers. And thanks, also, for all of your very excellent work.
