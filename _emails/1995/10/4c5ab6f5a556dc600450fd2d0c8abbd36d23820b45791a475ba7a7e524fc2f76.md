Netscape is in wide use. If a substantial number of people bothered to
use the Privsoft, then it might be worth breaking it. As it stands, I
don't think its worth my while. Maybe someone out there wants to
bother to do it as an exercise. It unfortunately has a bit of added
complexity because you have to learn a bit about image statistics in
order to do a good job of segregating the images, but it also looks
like you might be able to use multiple anagramming to get a nice
handle on the thing so your statistics don't have to be particularly
good.
