They can also be used only from the local machine on Windows or from any
machine your X server trusts on Unix.  Unless the attacker can control
what software is installed on the target system, there's no way for him
to use this to his advantage.  Of course, there's always the possibility
of exploting bugs, but that's not a "flawed algorithm".
